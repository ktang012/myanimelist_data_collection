            "content": "Disclaimer- this review takes into account the 4 episode \"sequel\" to the show\r\nWith the massive rise in access to entertainment and media/pop culture, we have gotten to the point where our options on what to watch are so stratified that we have the privilege of not liking something because its not our particular taste.  In the world of anime and manga this leads many to disregard shows that simply don't fit the criteria of what we find entertaining.  However, this does not mean that certain shows are objectively good or bad, it sometimes means that a show is an excellent version of whateverstyle or genre it is supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nKokoro Connect is a perfect example of this concept.  I am relatively new to Anime, and (despite my actual list) my tastes range from the classic DBZ (im old) to my new favorite Spice and Wolf (season 3 please!).  I try to watch each show objectively recognizing how it is supposed to fulfill its role in its particular genre.  Aside from Toradora (the show that made me pay attention to slice of life shows) i cannot think of too many shows that do such a great job of showcasing compelling drama, laughs, and heart warming romance.  For what it is supposed to be, Kokoro Connect is almost perfect.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 8\\n\r\nThe story of Kokoro Connect (KC) revolves around a supernatural conceit that drives the drama of the story.  Simply put, a group teenagers (already known for not having the best sense of control) are put in a position where they no longer truly control their own bodies.  Over the course of the story this takes on several different forms (some more compelling than others), but the awesome thing about it is that the writers were clearly creatively inspired by this seemingly silly premise.  A show that could have easily went on an ecchi, slapstick, \"accidental pervert\" fest, decided to use this as a way for the characters to learn more about themselves and each other, and we as the audience end up doing the same.  Toward the end the show does wander into some of the inane melodrama that plagues a lot of animes, but understanding that this is an inherent characteristic of the medium, such things cannot be helped.  To put it in perspective, this is the first anime i was able to get my completely uninterested wife to watch (most of it at least).\\n\\n\r\nArt/sound-9\\n\r\nAs a relatively new serious fan of anime (i had been a casual fan for decades)   I really can't speak from confidence on sound and art.  I have not developed a discerning eye for these things.  Ill just say that i personally enjoy clean, smooth, and crisp visuals/sound in my anime.  I have seen my fair share of shows in the past few months, and with many, i just cant get past the visuals. Whether it be an awkward and uninteresting art style, (Bokura Ga Ita) bland sound (Kimi No Todoke) or dated visuals (Peach Girl).  Kokoro Connect is great in all categories, its just not anything spectacular (Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\r\nI am an English teacher by trade (writer by fantasy).  I know what good character development is and how it is supposed to be done.  Although the techniques are gimmicky, and there are a few one note main characters (Aoki) i was still very impressed with the amount of depth delivered by the characters in this story.  More significantly, this was not the typical anime that made me roll my eyes at their behavior (most of the time).  When the inevitable love triangle presents itself, it makes sense.  When the guy starts choosing, it makes sense, when people get hurt- it makes sense.  When the drama and tension rises- it makes sense.  All of the characters motivations are not fully developed, but they are developed enough to make you care and not swoon over how contrived they are.  Again, for the genre and medium, this was an amazing job of characterization. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8\\n\r\nI have a short attention span when it comes to anime.  So when i actually watch all the episodes of a show (instead of wikipedia searching the plot til it gets to the good parts) i have to give that show high marks.  My favorite thing about this show is that it is an almost perfect length.  They dont draw out the inevitable sooooo long (I love you Toradora but im talking to you) and they dont end it anticlimactically  (every 3rd SOL romance does this).  The second to last arc was a little weak and less compelling and funny than the first two, but it was short and still entertaining.  Again, if you are looking for a  SOL/romance/comedy anime that doesnt make you embarrassed to be a fan with ridiculous characters, gratuitous fan service, and a blah ending.  You cant do much better than this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9",

            "content": "Is it just me, or do I only review shows beginning with the letter K?\r\nAnyway, just so you know, I'm also including the Michi Random specials in this review.\r\nStory: 10\r\nWhat would you do if you and your friends started randomly switching between each other's bodies?  Or if your deepest darkest desires were suddenly brought to the surface, out of your control?\r\nHere we have a series that takes a supernatural storyline, adds some well-written high-school romance and plenty of compelling drama, and pulls it all together into one amazing package.  Although some of the ideas may have been done many times before, Kokoro Connectmanages to make it fresh and funny, whilst also being surprisingly realistic with how it portrays the effects of each of the phenomena.  I felt the drama wasn't overdone at all and every arc introduced interesting new aspects of the story and allowed many sides of the characters to be shown.\\n\r\nUltimately, Kokoro Connect succeeds in blending its comedic school life shenanigans with more serious emotional moments, a testament to the quality of the writing and the great direction.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 10\\n\r\nI really liked the art for this series - everything is crisp and smoothly animated.  The characters instantly reminded me of K-On!, though upon checking, I was surprised to find that these two series don't actually have the same character designer.\\n\r\nThe settings are fairly detailed and we have some beautiful backgrounds and lush scenery.  As far as I could tell, there were no off-models or problems with animation.  \\n\r\nThe characters are all very expressive when they need to be.  Whether they are happy, angry, embarrassed or otherwise, their on-screen demeanours fit very well with the excellent voice acting.\\n\r\nWhilst I enjoyed the colourful and upbeat opening animation, it was the endings that really shone in my opinion.\\n\r\nOverall, Kokoro Connect is a very attractive looking show - Silver Link doing a commendable job here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe background music is great to hear; they fit the scenes nicely and add to the drama and emotion.\\n\r\nThe ending song also fades in before the ending animation, which I always find to be a nice touch when executed well like this.\\n\r\nMy personal favourites were the 2nd OP (Kimi Rhythm by Imai Masaki) and the 3rd ED (Salvage by Team.Nekokan [Neko] feat. Katakiri Rekka), though they are all really decent.\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, I think it was a job well done by all the seiyuu.  Even Heartseed with his tired, monotone voice I found to be sufficiently entertaining.  Throughout the series, a wide range of character traits and personalities were portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThe characters are what really make Kokoro Connect.  Unlike some other school-based romantic comedies, Kokoro Connect features fully fleshed out, three-dimensional people, each with very real pasts and flaws, which was what made me really care about them as I watched their story unfold.  They are apparently all somewhat misfits, so they form a Culture Club of sorts.\\n\r\nWithout going into too much detail, we have:\\n\r\nTaichi, an altruistic pro-wrestling fan who has a selfless urge to help others;\\n\r\nIori, a friendly energetic girl who is popular and loved by all;\\n\r\nHimeko, the cool and responsible one of the group, with considerable skill in information gathering and analysis;\\n\r\nYui, an expressive karate practitioner, who loves cute things;\\n\r\nand Yoshifumi - their casual friend, who is attracted to Yui (though she resists his advances).\\n\r\nI also have to mention one of the cutest imouto in anime - Yaegashi Rina - who is a caring sister that looks out for Taichi and, despite being younger, seems to give him advice about his relationships.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nKokoro Connect was really one of if not the best show of its season.  Watching the characters mature and develop was very compelling.  Over the course of the series, their pasts are revealed, along with their own shortcomings and how they overcome them.  The highlight is the character drama, and all in all, the series was practically perfect for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI have to say, Kokoro Connect is a must watch and I recommend it to everyone.  It was fully entertaining throughout.  As the supernatural phenomena start to take their toll on the five main characters - will their friendship be able to survive?  Join them on an emotional rollercoaster as you see them handle various unusual situations, all the while learning more about themselves and each other.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!

            "content": "Yet ANOTHER update on this review. This is one tricky anime to write a review on- Here goes.\r\nIn a school where extracurricular activities are mandatory, there exist five \"outlaws\". \r\nYaegashi Taichi, the pro-wrestling maniac\r\nNagase Iori, your typical spunky, bubbly, lovely character type\r\nInaba Himeko, the intelligent, cool computer expert... who is maybe just a tad bit too cool at times\r\nKiriyama Yui, lover of all things that are cute\r\nAoki Yoshifumi, frequently subject to rough treatment by the girls around him.\r\nThese five students form their own club, the \"Bunkenbu\" (Bunka Kenkyuu-bu)- and each day spent together is as ordinary as can be.\r\nUntil.\r\nKokoro Connect is best described as unique.It does not follow the plot of traditional romance anime, but instead, adds its own splash of color to what could have been considered \"trite and overused\". The first arc -Hito Random- sets the story off with the odd-at-the-very-least phenomenon of body-switching among the five main characters. Subsequent arcs deal with various phenomena (including a release of all desire and a manifestation of one's past self)- all quite intriguing and entertaining... but not limited to \"fun\"/\\n\\n\r\nWhile the events in Kokoro Connect are obviously not realistic, the audience is lead to think \"What if?\". Imagine suddenly being thrown into a mess of body-switching. Everyone has his or her own darkest secrets, desires, painful memories, and insecurities. Now, throw in the condition that four other people have access to all of the above  at any given time. These people are close friends... but can they really be trusted? Would you want them to know about your past? Your thoughts? Your secrets? The answer is probably \"Some things are better left untouched\".\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to a superb cast that really brings life to the characters, Kokoro Connect very realistically displays how a person would react when facing situations such as the ones listed above. It takes a concept that may sound lighthearted and shapes it into something deeper- even deeper and more complex than love ties that exist elsewhere in anime (which is saying quite a bit).\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect is a series I decided to watch on a whim after spotting it in CrunchyRoll one day, and I'm certainly glad that I did.\r\nI felt like the story was, by far, the stongest point of the series and what made it stand out from your average high school romance/drama anime. While the audience is never given a full and proper explanation of why the main cast suddenly find themselves swapping bodies with each other, reading the others' thoughts or acting on their supressed desires, among other things, all these events are handled really skillfully to flesh the series' themes out.\r\nAll the apparently bizarrehappenings have something in common: They force the main cast to lay their innermost emotions and struggles bare for their friends to see, no matter how much they might try to normally hide that side of them away, which is what prompts the others to try their best to help.\\n\\n\r\nThe way each character's problems were addressed was nice, and the characters felt relatable at most times. There were a couple of overly dramatic moments here and there, but I still felt like they worked well as set-ups for some really cathartic moments at the end of each arc.\\n\\n\r\nI've also got to commend the series on how it managed to ease the tension with comedic scenes that didn't amount to pandering to the audience. While there were a couple of scenes that stuck out as weird to me, I liked how the show was serious whenever it was addressing somebody's problems rather than just laughing them off with trope-ridden scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAbout whether I'd recommend this series or not, I'd say it depends on how much you care about series focused on character drama, since Kokoro Connect leans heavily on that. It felt like it didn't care all that much about explaining the bizarre happenings as much as it waned them to be there in order to explore each character and the bonds they make with their friends as a result of these trials they're put through.",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect is exceedingly mediocre. It is not bad by any definition of the term - the artwork, voice acting, and one particular character (you know who) are great and deserve commendation in an artistic medium saturated with high school romantic dramas. Additionally, the concept of body switching introduced for the first few episodes had a lot of promise and led to a lot of well-executed plot developments. The show never strayed into what could have easily been an ecchi bait premise and culminated in what was, to me, the climax of the show's story in Episode 5 with a (no spoilers) heart-wrenching decision tobe made by the cast members that actually made me pause and think what I would do in a similar situation.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the story and remaining characters of the show are mundane, unrealistic and at times even cringeworthy. I will preface this by saying that I am not Japanese - I am an American university student and a relative newcomer to anime. However, I have been around the block and have seen a few extremely well-done romance anime in the same vein as Kokoro Connect (Toradora!, Clannad, Monogatari), so I feel like I have a solid foundation upon which to base my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the story. As I mentioned earlier, the concept of body switching is actually a great idea and works very well in the high school drama setting. It is a mystery to me, then, why Kokoro Connect decides to just scrap it less than a third of the way through the show and change the supernatural events afflicting our main characters. There is so much untapped potential with the body switching premise that I would have loved to see. For example, much of the drama in the second half of the show could have been either avoided or played out much better if an extended body switch had happened between two characters that forced them to interact with the other's family, learning firsthand what their true daily life is like and further clarifying their root sources of trauma. Really, that's almost the entire point of body switching in a non-erotic setting - you are forced to spend a while in someone else's shoes and learn about them by living their lives. Instead we get mental thought transmissions and \"acting on your inner desires\". The first one is sort of interesting, but nowhere near as deep as body switching. The second one isn't even a supernatural phenomenon - it's called teenage hormones. I personally think this show could have done a lot more with 8-11 episodes of body switching only instead of dragging on for 17. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the main plot, it's mostly your typical Japanese high school romantic love-triangle borderline harem drama. There's supposed to be a main villain with Balloon Vine (Heartseed?), but there is really no point to his existence other to hand-wave away the phenomena as some kind of alien experiment. The point of this show is not explaining why these phenomena are happening, it's how the characters react to and deal with them together. You know at the end of the show you're going to get an official couple and that most of the character's problems will have been sorted out to some degree. I only wish that it didn't take so long to get there.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the characters, we come to what I think is this show's largest pitfall. The vast majority of the anime's cast are either as bland as raw pasta or act so unrealistically that trying to relate to them becomes nearly impossible. You've got Yaegashi, the stereotypical \"boku\"-using protagonist that espouses Japanese ideals of modesty, uprightness and chivalry while having practically no standout qualities whatsoever; Iori, a girl whose angst over her identity issues make for a very inconsistent and erratic character over the show; Aoki, the secondary male character and the only person preventing this from being a harem; Kiriyama, a girl with androphobia but whose solution to this problem is to be saved by others rather than confronting it herself; and Inaban, a strong female lead who is brutally honest, playfully violent and a breath of fresh air in an otherwise weak cast. Seriously, if you watch this show for anything, watch it for Inaban. She's great. \\n\\n\r\nThe only other person worth mentioning in the show is Balloon Vine, the main \"villain\" whose stated purpose for causing the supernatural phenomena to happen to our main group of five is literally just to fuck with them. Does this story really need a villain? The show does no legwork in explaining who he is or what motivates him to choose a group of Japanese high school students to experiment on, or why there is apparently a second, rival alien also involved with our main group. Kokoro Connect could have had effectively the same plot by just introducing the phenomena without any explained source and exploring how the characters react to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe ultimate reason why I did not enjoy this show was because these characters' dialogue and reactions to the phenomena felt incredibly unrealistic. Yes, this is an anime with body switching. Yes, there exist harem anime that I like, and the concept of a harem is constructed from male fantasy and is as far from real life relationships as possible. However, I feel that Kokoro Konnekt tries to pass itself as a somewhat true-to-life look at how a bunch of teenagers would act in supernatural situations but fails because it can't even master the portrayal of regular character interaction. Yaegashi is such a white knight that I wonder how anyone could have a healthy relationship with him; Iori is irrational even by teenage girl standards to the point where I can't even see why she does what she does from her point of view; and Kiriyama feels hypocritical in that she wants to become stronger and gain self confidence but instead relies almost entirely on Yaegashi for emotional support throughout the show. Even Inaban can act a little unrealistically sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Kokoro Connect is mediocre. Its higher than average production values, good voice casting and pretty good character in Inaban prevent it from being a failure, but so many other aspects of the show drag it down from being at least a decent watch. I cringed and interrogated my computer screen out loud multiple times while watching the show because I could not believe why certain characters acted the way they did or why certain parts of the show were just never explained. At the end I was left with a feeling of dissatisfaction and that my time should have been spent doing other things.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, I propose a drinking game whereby for every episode of Kokoro Kardashian you watch, take a shot every time you hear the word \"Tasukete!\", \"Mamoru!\", \"Suki!\", \"Daisuki!\", or \"Baka!. If you make it out alive, I will personally reward you with a medal.",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect begins with a pretty ordinary setting. 5 friends belonging to the same club with an absentee adviser, spending almost everyday loafing around. Then everything took a downturn when a mysterious entity named Fuusenkazura appeared and forced them into his game so they could entertain him. His \"game\" involves abnormal phenomena that often take place at random intervals. The first arc features body-swap, during which the 5 may switch bodies at random, and every arc that follows has them deal with other similarly bizarre situations. \r\nBefore anyone starts watching, all of this might sound pretty entertaining -- except each of these games that Fuusenkazurabrings them into produces big waves in their lives. Just imagine for a moment that your deepest secrets and darkest thoughts are dug out and exposed for your closest friends to see. Everyone needs to have a little privacy sometimes, but the games Fuusenkazura brings out always end up destroying their psychological defenses and put them in the spot to be honest with their friends, and also themselves. \\n\\n\r\nThrough the challenges the 5 of them face, the vulnerabilities of each person are shown to everyone else in the group. From there, the series soon turns into an emotional roller coaster that produces some serious drama. For the record, the drama doesn't feel forced at all. These characters are just what you'd expect of some regular high school kids who haven't had a firm grasp on their own identities. And it's the way they overcome each of these games and bond in the process that makes this series endearing. \\n\\n\r\nKokoro Connect is also no ordinary rom-com. There's romance and comedy, but the emphasis really ends up being emotional development more than anything. If you carefully chew through some of the things they say as they walk out of their slumps, you'll find nuggets of wisdom here and there applicable for just about everyone. The animation is decent and consistently fluid with no break in quality. The characters, while not necessarily coming out of unique molds, collectively form an lively, entertaining, and endearing cast. The plot is refreshing. The script is strong as well. Even though I personally found the soundtrack weak, it's a minor shortcoming in the face of everything else -- the story, the enjoyment, and the uplifting moments where they see the light at the end of the tunnel.\\n\\n\r\nTo close, I think Kokoro Connect is one of the most entertaining series I've picked up thus far, and I had a great deal of fun watching it. Simply put, it was a satisfying run. Although the format of struggle-then-triumph gets overused sometimes, the characters and the plot drive the series too well for that to interfere with the experience.  True, it's a bit heart-wrenching and depressing sometimes. At the end of the day though, it maintains a positive message throughout and is in my opinion a very well-crafted series that deserves almost everyone's attention. \\n\\n\r\n[Note: Although MAL separates the first 13 episodes of the series from the 4 episodes of \"Michi Random\" arc aired later on, the 17 episodes together feature an unbroken sequence of events and this review covers all of them.]",

            "content": "**Please take note: I am writing this review now, after seeing the first six episodes of Kokoro Connect. No spoilers are included in this review.***\r\nI decided to write this review because as I looked at the reviews for Kokoro Connect I noticed that many reviews were rated not helpful despite any good points the authors might have had. So I am writing to try and win over some readers and get people to at least try the anime. \r\nKokoro Connect is a story about five friends who end up experiencing an unnatural phenomena where they switch personalities with each other and have their friendship tested.At first the show seems like a slice of life anime with a nice gimmick, but this show offers more than that, I promise you. In just these first episodes the viewer is perplexed with the question of what makes up a person, their body or their personality? But the story continues from there as we see laughter, sadness, struggles with past experiences,current issues of self identity, relationships between friends, and much more. Lighthearted moments are shown mixed with deeper stronger emotional themes that have at points almost brought me to tears.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 9/10\\n\r\nOverall the story so far has worked out well and has been quite original. Kokoro Concect will have you on the edge of your toes the whole time. As I said earlier, you will see lighthearted moments as well as deeper emotional themes, all of which create a well balanced story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 10/10\\n\r\nAll of the characters in this show are likable and are well done. The characters have their place in the story and do not neatly fit into generic roles found in other anime. Some characters may be described as shy or strong-willed but they each have their complexities. I will not expand on the complexities the characters as to avoid spoilers, but you will see for yourselves. As for the character design, there is nothing to complain about. The characters are detailed and all fit their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 8/10\\n\r\nI am not and expert on animation art, but I can tell you the art in Kokoro Connect is decent. So far I have only seen this anime in 720p and I can say backgrounds are detailed, CGI is avoided, characters are detailed, and scenes are well animated. Overall the production values are decent with this anime, and the art does not distract or take away from the story or enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting for this show is spot on. The voice actors fit the roles of the characters they are portraying and are especially good at acting out scenes where personalities are switched between characters. There is not one annoying voice that distracts me from the story. As for music, The intro song is decent and the animation will make you smile. I do not listen to the outro very often, but it is decent as well. The soundtrack fits well with the tone of the show and is not intrusive to the viewers experience.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10\\n\r\nThis show has been very enjoyable to me. I actually care about the characters and want to see how they advance and develop. The plot has not been very predictable and has kept me intrigued.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10\\n\r\nI see no reason why anyone should not give this show a chance. So far, so good\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "High school is essentially one of the most important four years of someone\u2019s life. Throughout these years, not only does one fall under peer pressure, indecisive dramas, and separation into different clicks/social-groups, but you are often greeted with the unsatisfying feeling in overcoming mostly difficult, inexperienced tasks. However, the point of entering High School in the first place is to move onto secondary educations and learn not just fundamental cultures of others, but also about where you want to be in society for the rest of your life. During these times of hardships, not many people can gain true confidence; insecurities may rise from thepast, make many doubtful of themselves, and as a result contemplate loneliness, violence, etc.\\n\\n\r\nBut what every human really desires is the understanding of others; understanding of our flaws, weaknesses, highlights, memories, lusts, hatred, emotions, intelligence, shed tears, and acknowledgement in our refined existence. In other words, we want friends, people who takes pleasure in involving us in their lives.\\n\\n\r\nEstablished in the very High School setting, Kokoro Connect is an anime which explores the meanings of friendship in multitudes of emblematic, daring perspectives. Unlike other school rom-com anime, however, Kokoro Connect entangles its plot with dynamics by exposing the likes of evilness in characters and exaggerating certain aspects of the show to enhance not just enjoyment for the audience, but the substantiality in relationships as well. Absorbing the audiences with merely just its supernatural contents, Kokoro Connect also has a strong cast of characters to carry out its investigations of quarrels between the five trouble-children, who all happened to invest their free time into the Cultural Research Club. Of the group, the five members all embody several aspects of stereotypical adolescents. In short, there\u2019s the nice guy who apparently always finishes first (Taichi); his sidekick, who always pursues his crush regardless of circumstances (Aoki); the tsundere female archetype who, conveniently, is a black belt (Yui); an anti-social female who brings about justice in her own elegant ways (Inaba); and, the cute klutz archetype that always brightens up the mood with her visible smile (Nagase). However, there\u2019s always more than meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story steadily progresses, a creature going by the name Heartseed mysteriously brings about supernatural phenomenon in the group meant to somehow entertain it. Indeed, it did exactly that, and more. The first arc starts with the body swapping technique, where the group is challenged to understand the physical state of others in the group, their current family situations, and not misuse this opportunity for mischief. Unfortunately, even the slightest intervention of someone into your daily life could reveal subtle yet obvious problems one has. Eventually, the mental instability of many in the group begins to disclose, but luckily, friends are there to give moral support and justify the significance of their friends. It would\u2019ve been a simplex and sweet ending if the drama stopped there, but the injudicious Heartseed shows up again and screws everything up. From there on out, secrets of the past, dreams of the future, and the desires of the present are all exposed about each characters. Instead of hiding their fears, lustful thoughts, and ambitions, each character had to overcome their comfort zones, expose their contempt, true feelings for one another, and yet still wish for the acceptance of their friends. Since they're all teenagers exposed only recently to puberty, you could probably imagine what indecent, romantic thoughts some of these personal matters involved.\\n\\n\r\nAfter many of Kokoro\u2019s emotional roller-coasters, I became very attached to each of the characters. What Kokoro executes so well, not many productions can pull off easily. It develops each character into appealing people in some ways, and makes the audience so involved and invested in the emotional chaos the Series present. Perhaps due to their resemblances to realistic people, seeing Kokoro\u2019s characters make such human mistakes and overcoming it through genuine sentiments gave me a sense of responsibility, almost as if they\u2019re real-life, humane companions. Finally, the writers created dialogues which cleverly expressed some unique aspects of these characters and essentially, we gain our trusts of each eccentric person in the story through such techniques. For example; after several characters slowly developed aggressive, dementia-like traits due to Heart-seed's plans, it corrupted the healthy relationships between the Culture Research Club's members, instead of feeling mad or anger I felt sympathy towards the group just because of Kokoro's conventional script creations and its unhurried, deliberate pacing.\\n\\n\r\nBesides these shady dramas occurring on one side of the spectrum, Kokoro Connect usually has a rather lighthearted, Slice of Life vibe to compensate for all the suffering of these characters. The entrances of some of these comedy scenes are fairly coherent due to its consistency and the lighter weight on the dramatic side of it at first. But after Heartseed\u2019s introduction of deeper conflicts, I thought the comedy would just disappear from there or perhaps alternate into a realm of melodrama. Although Kokoro Connect inevitably executed some overly emotional scenes, the Show still managed to sneak in subliminal, dark humor and its ability to balance out the humorous yet intense sides of things impressed me. Without many spoilers, Kokoro tends to hinder at very humorous yet depraved concepts. Indeed, these comedic elements exceeded my expectation in how awkwardly situations elevated so quickly and became the most absurd stand-up comedies; yet, I don\u2019t think I ever laughed so hard in my life. The atmosphere, set-up, and state of affairs in these jokes all achieve perfection themselves, but the fact that these jokes even makes perfect contextual sense in the script-writing smothered my mind with enlightenment.\\n\\n\r\nDuring different times of the show where it required a certain type of mood, the animation was there to polish the atmosphere, especially with its apex of horrifying, variegated, blood dripping-like backgrounds. The character designs fared up splendidly with many embellished specialties among places where and when needed. Facial expressions and the blocking of characters also contributed to the comfortableness feel Kokoro sometimes had at first and its ability to immediately transfer that cozy texture into suspense. \\n\\n\r\nThe musical introduction added a nice vibe in the air with the OP, and concluded in a fashionable manner with the ED, both of which epitomizes typical, catchy, yet meaningful Jpop songs. Remarkably, the background music syncs with the elements of animation where required as well; during the committing of mischief, lighthearted music plays while dramatic, mawkish music spectacles uncertainty during climatic moments. Notably, voice actor(esse)s even gave spontaneousness and energy to their 2-D characters. In essence, the visuals and melodies ended up contributing very effectively.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kokoro Connect, utilizing supernatural themes to its advantages, is a Series illustrating an accurate stance on the dangers and rewards of relationships. Through surreal artwork & humor it brings the seemingly two dimensional characters into life, and builds each character up with depth whilst still in correlation with the story-line. Although extravagantly detailed and over-dramatic at times, Kokoro still succeeds in coping with the balances of its several genres, and radiated powerful messages as intriguing as its provocative, headstrong humor. As an exceptionally done Slice of Life formulated Series; I recommend Kokoro Connect to anime fans who enjoys silly comedies, complicated High School relationships, and wouldn\u2019t mind challenging themselves with the concepts of true friendship, conformity, and being true to your instinctive, romantic feelings.",

            "content": "When I first heard the plot summary for Kokoro Connect I thought it sounded like some hentai series. Even if it wasn't, it seemed obvious that it would be a provider of ample fan-service, it of course wasn't though. After all, if you swapped bodies with someone of the other gender, what would be the first thing you do? \r\nYep, the obvious, see how well they masticate. Read it again, what were you thinking of? \r\nKokoro Connect revolves around the daily, not so normal lives of Taichi, Iori, Himeko, Yoshifumi and Yui and their encounters in the Cultural Research Club. Up until recently they thoughtthat they and their friends lived normal happy lives, but now the Heartseed is pulling their lives apart and exposing their inner secrets through body switching, urges and age regression.\\n\r\nThe love and teen pentagonal comedy follows the strange phenomena at the Yamahoshi Academy's Culture Club, starting with the five male and female club members switching bodies with each other.\\n\\n\r\nMix two parts school uniforms and setting, two parts moe, and one part original detail. Blend thoroughly. Serve warm.\\n\r\nProduction values are quite good, and there's a good level of detail to go around most of the time. Some scenes are picturesque. At other times, there's an unfortunate loss of detail in mid-ground elements that makes it difficult to focus, but this doesn't happen very often over the stretch.\\n\r\nWhile this is not a show whose events are ever intended to push aural or visual envelopes, Kokoro Connect is well-animated, and there is never a point where this show looks anything but nice. There is a bit of fan-service here and there but nothing so intrusive that it distracts from the relationship dynamics.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the animation, I am personally getting tired of the K-ON-like moe look; whether you like how the characters are designed is really based on personal preference. As for quality, Silver Link doesn't offer anything as stunning as a P.A. Works anime, but it manages to hold its own. There were no noticeable mistakes in body proportions, angles, or object size and the quality remains consistent throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nI have to commend the main cast for the first arc they essentially had to act as five (and in some cases six) different characters, since each character used the voice that went along with the body when they switched, and they all did a rather good job. I've heard some complaints that this studio Silver Link isn't known for hiring really great actors but I think they did a mediocre job this time.\\n\\n\r\nBoth OPs and EDs are quite catchy and serve well as introductions to the series though nothing to memorable. Sound effects are nothing remarkable but do their job throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nEverything this series does is for the emotional and dramatic effect, and thus the characters all have very interesting backgrounds. What the show does do a good job of, however, is not washing over things. Whatever happens to the characters their pain isn't easily fixed like some anime likes to do. Throughout the series you still see traces of the pain in the characters and that everything that has happened has strongly affected them one way or another.\\n\\n\r\nThey're forced to develop at a rapid pace is a direct product of the supernatural elements of the plot. The point can definitely be made that these elements are a contrivance. When it comes to the concluding arc I'd even tend to agree more often than not. That doesn't entirely eliminate the effect of more than half a season of strong build-up, however the worst thing for me was that, despite the title, I couldn't \"connect\" with any of the characters, they was more like actors interpreting their roles. Almost everything they said or did felt like forced for the sake of the plot, and Taichi out of them all, is just a place holder for a proper main character, as his personality was not actually explored.\\n\\n\r\nI appreciate that it had the guts to go for actual drama and to ask interesting questions.  Ultimately though, you have to deliver results.  I also think the series suffers quite a bit due to a cast that\u2019s fairly weak in the final analysis.  Taichi\u2019s issues I\u2019ve already covered, and with Inaba the problem was simply that I never liked her very much \u2013 she\u2019s easily the most clich\u00e9d member of the cast and I never really bought into her self-important self-pity and overcompensating and overbearing arrogance.  Aoki and Yui had a definable plot arc, at least, but they were largely plot devices, as Taichi was.  It was really only Nagase that emerged as both a likeable and well-defined character, and she too tended to be manipulated for the contrivance of the plot far too often.\\n\\n\r\nInteresting, original premise. Strong opening. Mediocre mid section. Poor ending. It's a downward slope all the way past the first arc - which is a real shame, because the initial episodes hint at the potential for a truly exciting series. Instead we're left with an unfinished mess that takes those pieces that had a chance at greatness and just kind of drops them on the ground.\\n\\n\r\nSo does will this series connect you your heart? Possibly. Perhaps not.\\n\r\nWill I stop with these stupid puns? Never.",

If you're into pointless high school drama, this show is for you.\r\nIn a phrase, this show is \"YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME!\" repeated for thirty minutes, seventeen times. The characters are repeatedly put into positions where it's determined (by the group) that they would all be better off if they talked about their feelings, and then proceed to not talk about their feelings. Everyone is a victim of some \"pressure\" from their friends, despite all of their problems being caused almost entirely by themselves. Everyone puts on some kind ofselfless front \"for the better of the group\" and inevitably makes things worse for everyone as a result.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is a cool premise, it's just that the characters are all irritating and incredibly dense. The art is solid, and the sound is good as well. The characters are what kill this show for me. All three girls complain that nobody will ever understand them because [insert any given problem], one guy is an annoying white knight type you'd see on a cosplay forum, and the other could be replaced by a sizable rock without changing the story at all.\\n\\n\r\nHow this show has anything above a five is perplexing to me.",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect is a rarity in anime.  It is a romantic drama that thanks to the strengths in its characters and writing avoids the annoying melodrama that shows like Golden Time and more recently Glasslip unfortunately fall prey to... For the most part anyway.  This can probably be attributed to its satisfactory pacing, which again is something quite a few shows in this genre seem struggle with.  The review will cover Michi Random as well.  Now on to the review!\r\nStory: Requires suspension of disbelief far too often, but is still well-written and well-paced.\r\nIts setup we see far too often in animethese days: A club of misfits have to deal with a fantastical situation that leads to drama and lighthearted comedic moments.  Not exactly treading innovative waters.  However, Kokoro proves that execution is everything by taking standard anime tropes showing you not everyone is so simple.  The plot starts off with the club members switching bodies seemingly at random.  At first this creates hilarity and confusion, but it isn't until later on we see the rather devastating mental  effect this can have on a group of insecure angsty teenagers.  Drama is handled in a mature, believable manner and was always entertaining to watch. Sexual tension is incredibly high in this anime which is a little odd, but makes the romance feel more authentic in my opinion.  The ending is strong as well resolving all conflicts between characters, but oddly not explaining the phenomenons that had been plaguing the our lead characters the entire show.    \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The definite strong point of the show.  Every single one is explored and developed thoroughly.\\n\\n\r\nYoshifumi Aoki- Master of nothing.  He's the most boring character in terms of.. well.. just about everything and relies on the rest of the cast to make him interesting (its even admitted in the show).  He does play a pivotal role in developing the rest of the cast and is actually well-developed character himself.  Just not an exciting one.\\n\\n\r\nHimeko Inaba- Master of being waifu material. As many who have actually seen this show to its conclusion will agree, Inaba is awesome.  She practically carries this show on her back just as she often tries to with her friends in the show.  I don't want to spoil too much since this shows plot is essentially its characters but she is a coodere.  Seems cold, uncaring, and methodical but in reality is still just girl with girl problems.  Something she is embarrassed to admit.\\n\\n\r\nYui Kiriyama- Master of Karate, but is actually the most vulnerable out of the five.  She tends to over think things to point where she almost always feels like a burden and her back story matches her present-day personality quite well.  Much like Aoki she is well-written but not that exciting.\\n\\n\r\nIori Nagase- Master of deception.  This character is best described as Chitanda (Hyouka) x Sengoku (Monogatari: Second Season).  She is cheerful, playful, and basically the opposite of Inaba although they still share a strong friendship.  Despite all of her upbeat antics she is subject of/to nearly all of the drama this series has to offer.  Because in this show not everyone is what they seem to be.\\n\\n\r\nTaichi Yaegashi- Master of wrestling.  Taichi is our main protagonist and is a \"selfless-freak\" in the words of Inaba.  She is correct.  \"Typical\" nice guy that wants to help everyone even if he knows attempting to do so will only cause them more pain.  His greatest strength is also is greatest flaw and that makes him pretty interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Effective at setting the mood.\\n\\n\r\nIts effective and timed well in all scenes.  It never out of place or disrupts the mood, but its nothing that I will ever remember now that the show is finished.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art is good, animation is pretty standard.\\n\\n\r\nEverything is well drawn, and character designs in particular seem to stand out, but the animation can be noticeably lackluster in some scenes.  It never was enough to take me out of the experience though.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: At just 18 episodes this show is more than worth your time.  And, Himeko Inaba is pretty damn awesome. \\n\\n\r\nWatch if you:\\n\r\n-Are tired of character tropes\\n\r\n-Enjoy an unpredictable, but not over dramatic love-triangle\\n\r\n-If Rom-drams are your thing (in that case why havn't you seen this yet!?)\\n\r\n-Enjoy supernatural anime \\n\r\n-Enjoyed Nagi no Asukara\\n\r\n-Want a climatic and conclusive ending\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch if you:\\n\r\n-Absolutely can not stand teenage drama\\n\r\n-Hate characters that tend to wallow in self-pity\\n\r\n-Don't enjoy drastic mood swings in your anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "NOTE: This review includes the 4 \u201cMichi Random\u201d episodes.\r\n\u201cWhat defines humans... Defines us? Nobody will notice a change on the inside if you look the same on the outside.\u201d\r\nWhat happens your desires and thoughts are no longer simply  your own, but are also shared with your closest friends? How will it affect your friendship when you uncontrollably make a move on the guy your friend likes, or even if you find out a dark secret that your friends kept from you? \r\nThese are all questions (among many others) which KokoroCo tries to bring to light. In a way, you could say this is asmuch a SOL-series, as it is a psychological test.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nThe basic plot is very simple, to be honest. A group of friends encounter, and have to deal with, a multitude of different phenomena which in different ways reveal their deepest desires and secrets to the other people in the group. However, it\u2019s the rather interesting way these phenomena are presented, executed, and dealt with which makes this show very interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEven though most of it can be pretty sad or depressing in ways, they\u2019ve done a good job in throwing in some comedic scenes, without making it feel like they\u2019re going out of their way just to be funny, so it all flows really well,  which I thought was nice. \\n\r\nI find it hard to actually talk more about the story, without really going into specific events and more detail, and unfortunately that would spoil the experience for you a bit.\\n\\n\r\nLength-wise, I think 17 (counting the specials) episodes were just perfect, and the sort of open ending both offers adequate closure and sets up for a good chance to read the remaining 7 books, I\u2019d assume (unless there\u2019s a lot of difference between the anime and the first 4 novels).\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nThe art was certainly very well done. (Like others, it seems) I was actually reminded of KyoAni\u2019s sort of \u201cspecial\u201d art style, but to my surprise, they weren\u2019t involved at all. Even so, all the characters were very well drawn (even the side-characters), and animation was nice and smooth. There are a lot of emotional scenes present, and whether a character was expressing happiness, sadness or anger, it was always done in such a way that it didn\u2019t feel \u201coverdone\u201d, or \u201coff\u201d in any way, which of course is a big plus.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I would like to point out is fanservice. Now, I\u2019ve gotten pretty used to seeing a fair share of fanservice in anime, even (or especially) in the ones revolving around a bunch of highschool friends. But to my surprise, there really isn\u2019t much of that to find anywhere here. \\n\r\nThere are maybe 3 or 4 very short scenes like these, and I found it very nice that they didn\u2019t try to break up the emotions with random boob-shots.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nOf course, in a show so focused on the emotional changes of our characters, good voice acting will be needed to really be able to bring the (very well done) writing to life, in a smooth and relatable way. To be honest, I really believe the voice actors all managed to do this.\\n\r\nThey all fit their respective characters very well, and to be able to display so many emotions throughout a rather short time, really takes a bit of effort. \\n\r\nThe one who stood out to me the most, however, was easily Nagase Iori. How she was able to both represent this happy, childish girl, as well as the cold, darker side of Iori we get to see was truly well done.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music; The background music did a good job at accompanying the writing, but it never really tried to overtake any other aspect, which was nice, and even if I personally didn\u2019t really care for the opening theme all too much, I think it shows the happy, hoping side of the group in a nice way. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nNow this is where things get really good. In short, the characters are all very well written and synergizes rather well with each other. At a first glance, most of the characters appear quite innocent and \u201cplayful\u201d (for lack of better words), except for maybe Inaba, who acts as the stern leader of the group. However, as the story goes on, darker sides are revealed, and as we find out more about each characters backstories, you learn that they\u2019re not quite as innocent and/or happy as they\u2019d like you to think, and this is all what makes you care and feel for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, a show about being forced to reveal your darkest secrets wouldn\u2019t be very interesting if said secrets were all kinda \u201cmeh\u201d, would it? Thankfully, all of the characters (save for one, I guess) have rather good backstories, and this also contributes a lot to character development. As they struggle to overcome their past problems/traumas, they actually develop as characters, and synergise with the other characters in new ways, which again brings up a lot of new scenarios.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nTo be honest, I\u2019m usually not able to marathon shows if I\u2019m watching them by myself (as I easily get distracted in between episodes), and in that case, it usually takes me a while to finish a series, because I don\u2019t necessarily always feel like watching anime at that moment. However, there are exceptions to this, and KokoroCo is definitely one of those. Even if I didn\u2019t marathon all the 17 episodes in one go, I certainly got through this a lot faster than many other series, because I kept feeling like I wanted more of the characters, and wanted to see what would happen next etc. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it\u2019s rather bittersweet, but I think this was very close to being one of my favorites.",

            "content": "\u201cOne of the most beautiful qualities of friendship is to understand and to be understood.\u201d\r\nWhat Kokoro Connect essentially delves into, is exactly that, the notion of what friendship is, and how do we keep it alive when your true desires, love, selfishness, fears, pasts and fragility are all unleashed and out in the open. \r\nOne day a sudden paranormal occurrence of body-switching haunts a small group of five friends, which in turn alters their relationship and every day lives. \r\nSince the plot is pretty much straightforward with a slight twist, Kokoro Connect is more of a character motivated Anime; with it being more ambitiouson the interactions and chemistry front between the characters. I think the characters are not only convincingly believable, but have a real depth and insight to them; (Yui; androphobia, Iori; multiple personality disorder?) we truly see a good portrayal of emotions and human nature.\\n\\n\r\nThe supernatural occurrences definitively disrupt the harmony amongst the five friends as it not only, sends their feelings in turmoil, but also makes them closer friends simultaneously. The initial idea of body-switching is, in itself a charming premise but also happens to open a can full of funny situations too, as you can imagine.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I also liked was the atmosphere that Kokoro Connect gives; the orangey sunset sceneries at the beginning feel reminiscent of high school nostalgia with intentions to keep it light-hearted. Alongside that, there is also an eerie, sinister tone when the entity Heartseed enters the fray (his gormless, creepy, unpredictable look about him also contributed to this xD). That is certainly one factor that kept me interested, the eagerness to find out what is behind the mysteriousness and ambiguity of this Heartseed entity that was causing all the supernatural phenomena, the enigma of his powers, what he actually is and what his real intentions are. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough those are the defining factors I liked in particular, there are also many evident blemishes I could also point out. Being a slice of life drama set in the high school timeframe following both female and male students there are predetermined hints to your conventional genre clich\u00e9s, we have seen it all to often with the overplayed depictions of love triangles and pour-your-heart-out, lovey-dovey confessions scenes; all I can say is Kokoro Connect doesn\u2019t differ from this nor does it attempt to, while it tries not to overly focus on these things, the fact remains is that these overdone concepts are embraced, and the way it\u2019s pulled off may be too generic for some. \\n\\n\r\nWe also have the character designs and art style that are nothing special to be honest; all plainly bland looking, nothing outstanding, it\u2019s what you would expect from most other Anime. The characters themselves could also be considered clich\u00e9, as you might say it features some of your common personalities in Anime shows, although I still think it\u2019s one of the more stronger aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the general premise of the Anime starts quite well, what with the body-swapping idea, it eventually moves onto other mind-boggling notions. With the original idea still fresh in your mind, I feel the episodes gradually drop its appeal with each supernatural premise, and swings its tone to a less light-hearted, funny atmosphere to a more darker and dampening one at the ending stage of each phenomena; this also inserts more exaggerated, melodramatic and overemotional moments. Although this tonal shift could in my opinion be handled in better fashion, it also effectively brings in, deeper more meaningful themes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the most unsatisfying thing was undoubtedly the ending, lets just say there are so many unanswered questions and left with a sense of bewilderment and discontent. (This thing really irked me xD)\\n\\n\r\nSo, all in all \u201cWhy should I watch this?\u201d you maybe thinking, well if you enjoy a well thought out Anime, which makes you think about the real meaning of friendship and puts you into empathetic scenarios, albeit engaging you into an emotional roller-coaster of a drama with heartwarming conclusions at times, while still keeping it funny and light-hearted, then I say go for it!\\n\\n\\n",

Maybe a lot of shoujo vibes, with a lot of fluff and comedy. But what I got was that, and then some. \r\nI won't go too much into detail, because that's spoiling, but I just keep getting more pleased with this anime as the episodes continue to air. It starts off as a normal school life anime, and then BAM, plot twist, and your entire perspective is thwarted. In a goodway, of course. \\n\\n\r\nI desperately recommend everyone to watch this, because it's really good. Even if shoujo isn't your thing; you can't really consider this a shoujo. Think of it more as...a school life comedy with some of it's deeper moments thrown in.",

The story at first was all about friends sticking together and never giving up no matter what and then it just kept flipping from wanting to be a drama to a romance back to a drama.  \\n\r\nArt:5\\n\r\nThe art doesnt stand out at all because most of it is a 2 shot in a classroom so randomly the animation will spike up at times.\\n\r\nSound:3\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is either non existent or just so bland that I dont even notice it while watching and the opening and ending themes are your typical drumbeat in the background with some violins and lyrics about lover.\\n\r\nCharacters:2\\n\r\nI cant put to words how much I dislike every character in this anime, well Im going to try. First off their is Aoki who is non existent through 90% of the anime, Inaba who is the only slightly likable character but then she ruins most of her credibility with that certain quote in that certain episode, Yui who's only contribution to the anime is breaking a table and getting kicked in the balls, Iori who has a major personality complex and thinks she isnt herself because of it, Taichi who is your typical save everyone character and is the worst out of everyone and sadly gets the most airtime next to Iori.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nIm not gonna lie this anime was very good at the beginning but after a few episodes you can predict everything that will and can happen.\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nThis anime had so much potential but it just fell short almost like they switched writers and decided to take it in a whole new direction.",

            "content": "There is alot to say about Kokoro Connect, it was a rather odd, yet extremely enjoyable experience for me. I can kind of understand why this anime gets alot of flak from people, but that's not the animes fault, the problem that the anime \"has\" isn't a problem at all, it's disliked in the same way school days is, not because it's badly designed, but because it's something people don't like. People confuse something as being bad because they don't like it, but that couldn't be farther from the truth, hopefully my review sheds some light on this anime and can help anyone that's onthe fence about it make their mind up, also this is for the  whole anime, that includes the 4 \"extra\" episodes, they are essential the story and should have been aired at the same time as the original anime, but for some reason it wasn't. \\n\\n\r\nStory- The story in Kokoro connect is different from how the synopsis describes it, that's part of it, but now what the story is just about. They go through certain \"tests\" as a group, the first being randomly body swapped, i'm not going to spoil what the others are, but stuff like being able to hear the other members thoughts happen as well, it's actually a really good idea and makes for a very intense and interesting story. I would definitely call it one of the more uniquely written stories out of all of the anime I have watched. The story has it's ups and downs as far as emotions go, it has it's funny moments that are hilarious in their own respect and it also has some very touching and emotional scenes, and the best part is that these scenes are perfectly balanced, it never feels like it should have been serious when it was being funny and vice versa. I was expecting the story to be kind of shit and just nonsensical like some people have said, but I found it to be the opposite of that. It was wrote extremely well, had plenty of varying issues that they had to overcome, had great character interactions, no down time, stayed interesting all the way through, the only part of the story you could complain about was something that happened down the line, which is how it's suppose to be. Not all anime is suppose to make you feel good about yourself, some stuff is suppose to do the opposite and make you feel like shit, make you feel anger and resentment, it's suppose to make you feel a variety of emotions, some examples of anime like this that are misunderstood would be something like school days, or even aku no hana to an extent. All of that being said I think the story is amazing, even that part that made me start hating a certain character, it was suppose to be that way. The ending was something I was worried about, I always worry about the ending to animes because it seems like alot of really good anime are spoiled by a shit ending that makes no sense or leaves off on a bad cliffhanger, but not kokoro connect. It had a very satisfying ending, it told it's story and didn't decide to drag itself out and over stay it's welcome like a lot of anime seem to do nowadays. \\n\\n\r\nArt- The art is nothing special, it's your average run of the mill anime type art style with nothing special about it, which works in it's favor. You really get the sense that this is happening to a regular group of friends, which I think adds to the overall feel of the anime in a positive way.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The op/ed sountrack is pretty good, it fits the feel of the anime really well. The music scores are on queue everytime and simply adds more to scenes. It's kind of hard to mess up the sounds assets of anime nowadays, also dat sax solo. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The characters in kokoro connect are arguably more important than the story. The entire show is based around this group of friends finding out more about each then they were supposed to, if the characters are boring and uninspired then the show would be trash. They all have something about them that makes them unique in some way, which can be hard since there are 5 main characters. They all feel as fleshed out as characters and you can see them change in believable ways that don't break the story or immersion. Some anime doesn't do this, they make the character do something they wouldn't normally do, or they make them into a badass when they were originally a geek or something along those lines, it's immersion breaking when that happens and it ruins the anime for me most of the time. Being that there are 5 main characters that are fully fleshed out, that makes for a really good time. You know these characters on a deeper level so when something funny happens you find yourself laughing with them at what happened and when something tragic happens you find yourself being depressed about it. The characters and story are what this anime as amazing as it is, without the interesting characters to support the awesome story it would fail, and vice versa. They have a perfect harmony and pace that is refreshing to see, not many anime get the pacing and character interactions right, but this one does and i'm glad I took the time to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- There is no downtime in this anime, something interesting is always happening and you're never left having to watch a few filler episodes to get to the good parts of the anime. Watching these 5 characters just interact with each other is fun enough, throw in a well realized story that never stops with the curve balls and you have yourself a fantastic anime along with an experience that you won't be able to forget. This anime never lets up, and that's one of it's best qualities, non-stop entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Overall I was quite surprised by Kokoro Connect, I often find that alot of controversial anime usually either sucks or is awesome, and I always love it when i'm wrong about an anime, it's the best feeling in the world. I'm so glad I decided to watch it, it was highly enjoyable, well made, well designed, excellently executed, and enjoyable to boot. If you enjoy mystery, romance, or just plain weird anime that is designed well then kokoro connect is a must watch. It's something unique, it tells a story that no other anime has come up with before and makes it awesome. Romances are a dime a dozen, same with high school slice of life, but this one breaks that monotony and tries something new, and definitely succeeds. Watch it now if you like what you've seen here, or hell , just try it if you're looking for something new to watch, you won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "Note: At the time of writing this review, i have only watched up to 11 episodes. Thus, the review might not be too accurate as more episodes air, but i will try my best to give a good review with my understanding of these first 11 episodes. (at the time when this review was initially written, it was only 6 episodes watched, i added in several things about the new arcs in the series this time round.)\r\nTo be honest, Kokoro Connect was not in my list of anime to watch for the season initially, nor did it catch my interest at first. When reading thestory synopsis, i was expecting it to be a light hearted series overall with mainly humorous events when the characters swap their bodies. \\n\\n\r\nHow wrong i was.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes pace pretty quickly as the anime starts to get dark. This whole body swapping business starts to get worse as time progresses with even more implications in the daily lives of the characters, as well as how they interact with one another. For those who like a fair share of drama in their anime, Kokoro Connect is your cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have shown distinct character development as the story progresses. We get a deeper look into their lives, and their personalities as well. We come to understand why the characters behave the way they do because of circumstances in their lives, and that makes the viewer attached to the characters. We can emphatise with them, and it draws us in to want to watch even more.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime enters a new arc in episode 6. Just when we thought body swapping was the worst it could get, the series throws us another curveball. This lets us think even more deeply to what might happen to the characters we know and like. Kokoro Connect sure is addictive to watch.\\n\\n\r\nUnleashing your true desires makes you aware of how you really feel and what you really want. However, it brings fear at the same time. Fear of unleashing these desires at the wrong time. Its interesting to see how the characters cope with the inevitable, as even though there is the fear of being unable to suppress one's true desires, one cannot distance themselves from people forever. All humans are sociable in nature and enjoy company. No matter how anti-social a person is, he/she will get lonely eventually. We gain a nice insight on how the characters takes things in their stride and face the events that happen in their life, as well as how events slowly unfold and true feelings are revealed.\\n\\n\r\nCoincidentally, episode 11 is another new arc, where the characters periodically revert back to their young selfs for a few hours at a time. The catch is that they are able to remember things from when they are young even after they revert back to their original selves. This brings forth a lot of new possibilities. Everyone has things from the past which they want to conceal from others, as well as themselves. Everyone wants to avoid thinking about bad memories from before. However, as memories from the past surface and haunt the characters again, how will they deal with it? Will they stand up to it bravely, or will they shy away and avoid the truth? We shall see in the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn my case, Kokoro Connect is a hidden gem. If you are a person who likes a nice mix of drama and humour in the premise of high school life, i definitely recommend Kokoro Connect. I enjoyed every minute of it (even when up to episode 11 so far), and i'm sure you would too.",

            "content": "**Takes into account of the 4 extra episodes.\r\nKokoro Connect is an anime that is not going to appeal to everyone. Why? Because many episodes are dedicated to the characters and how they deal with their inner conflicts and problems. Of course on the surface their daily lives are not anything interesting until Heartseed greets them and they are faced with certain phenomenons which force them to change. And how they change is the true gem of this show, as it becomes from any other slice-of-life to a supernatural and mysterious that drags viewers in.\r\nThese unusual phenomenons range from switching minds in bodies and to givein to their impulses, something very haunting the characters find themselves losing control of who they are or who they thought they are. How would people react if they did not have authority over themselves? What if someone was able to get in your head? Listen to what you truly think? It's a scary thought as it stripes these characters bare, revealing their true personalities. It tests their trust, friendship and commitment. But most important of all - their identities. How truly fragile is a person's personality? How genuine? How easily can you deceive, lie and fool someone when wearing a mask?\\n\r\nThere is one way to describe what these phenomenons affect the characters and its this:\\n\r\nIt destroys them, absolutely breaks them apart. They corrupt in their own insecurities and struggle trying to overcome it. Their protections, barriers are all torn down and the question is - how do they deal with it? \\n\r\nThat's where it gets gripping and compelling because they make us question ourselves.\\n\\n\r\nAs I've said before, since this anime is so heavily based on their characters - many episodes come across as \"fillers\" but they are all very important to their progression.\\n\\n\r\nThere are 5 characters in this anime - with 13+4 extra episodes I didn't expect anything extraordinary, what could they do with characters with such little time? I was very wrong.\\n\r\nAoki:\\n\r\nA free character, seems careless and carefree he tries to live with no regrets - unfortunately, he seems to bring mayhem everywhere and his way of living is portrayed very reckless; unaware of how his decisions affect those who are around him. I thoroughly enjoyed watching him try to find a deeper understanding of himself. It is powerful to see one find the source of their true feelings.\\n\\n\r\nKiriyama:\\n\r\nVery kind and gentle, Yui is sweet and generally, another light-hearted character. In fact I believed she would be a dull character, expecting her to just be that cute one. But Kokoroco does not fail and we get to see her true fear: one she has buried for so long. Watching her trying to overcome this was both painful but reassuring.\\n\\n\r\nInaba:\\n\r\nThough coming across a bit too honest and controlling - she is very logical and calm towards situations that require analysing. But can you analyse your feelings? Can data predict how you feel? Inaba is a complex character, that I had trouble understanding. A very mysterious character with many insecurities hidden by arrogance you can almost feel a sense of relation to her, she gave me one of the best impressions and her development was truly something else.\\n\\n\r\nIori:\\n\r\nNow a character that needs time to wrap your head around, the development dedicated to her was at times too rushed but I believe, necessary. Identity, individuality, all tricky elements to a persons personality. How they perceive themselves and project themselves to other people. Now this was a character with immense depth, honest and brutal, I am sure anyone will enjoy watching her unfold.\\n\\n\r\nTaichi:\\n\r\nYour typical, selfless and considerate main character - come on, we've come across this type of protagonist countless times. Noble. Generous. He's a character you'd roll your eyes at: you think, come on, you have to be selfish somehow. But this character gives you a gleam of hope, he was fleshed out to the max. Unlike the other characters, his struggle was perhaps too much of a thing.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime did not forget any character and gave its cast the proper time it needed to mature and grow. Their flaws, strengths and deepest fears. Everything is exposed that viewers truly feel with them, you can easily relate with how they react even if you have not experienced it before.\\n\r\nWhile the story can seem as some sort of prop to be used for character development, their is a mist of mystery and suspense around it's events that are overlooked. Definitely unpredictable, this anime is an emotional ride. The individual elements of comedy, action and romance are paced carefully well.\\n\r\nIn a more critical view, the plot/storyline is not explored completely and seems to be only used as some sort of device for the characters. The actual process of the phenomenons and explanations are very vague and even Heartseed himself is unknown and peculiar. That may be annoying to some, as its core is not clear or comprehensible which makes rooms for misunderstandings and plot holes.\\n\r\nThere are endless possibilities, choices to do with this anime, so it makes sense that it appears too slow-paced or boring as it does explore many of the components. \\n\r\nBut the characterization is something that can't be missed out on.",

            "content": "Disclaimer- this review takes into account the 4 episode \"sequel\" to the show\r\nWith the massive rise in access to entertainment and media/pop culture, we have gotten to the point where our options on what to watch are so stratified that we have the privilege of not liking something because its not our particular taste.  In the world of anime and manga this leads many to disregard shows that simply don't fit the criteria of what we find entertaining.  However, this does not mean that certain shows are objectively good or bad, it sometimes means that a show is an excellent version of whateverstyle or genre it is supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nKokoro Connect is a perfect example of this concept.  I am relatively new to Anime, and (despite my actual list) my tastes range from the classic DBZ (im old) to my new favorite Spice and Wolf (season 3 please!).  I try to watch each show objectively recognizing how it is supposed to fulfill its role in its particular genre.  Aside from Toradora (the show that made me pay attention to slice of life shows) i cannot think of too many shows that do such a great job of showcasing compelling drama, laughs, and heart warming romance.  For what it is supposed to be, Kokoro Connect is almost perfect.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 8\\n\r\nThe story of Kokoro Connect (KC) revolves around a supernatural conceit that drives the drama of the story.  Simply put, a group teenagers (already known for not having the best sense of control) are put in a position where they no longer truly control their own bodies.  Over the course of the story this takes on several different forms (some more compelling than others), but the awesome thing about it is that the writers were clearly creatively inspired by this seemingly silly premise.  A show that could have easily went on an ecchi, slapstick, \"accidental pervert\" fest, decided to use this as a way for the characters to learn more about themselves and each other, and we as the audience end up doing the same.  Toward the end the show does wander into some of the inane melodrama that plagues a lot of animes, but understanding that this is an inherent characteristic of the medium, such things cannot be helped.  To put it in perspective, this is the first anime i was able to get my completely uninterested wife to watch (most of it at least).\\n\\n\r\nArt/sound-9\\n\r\nAs a relatively new serious fan of anime (i had been a casual fan for decades)   I really can't speak from confidence on sound and art.  I have not developed a discerning eye for these things.  Ill just say that i personally enjoy clean, smooth, and crisp visuals/sound in my anime.  I have seen my fair share of shows in the past few months, and with many, i just cant get past the visuals. Whether it be an awkward and uninteresting art style, (Bokura Ga Ita) bland sound (Kimi No Todoke) or dated visuals (Peach Girl).  Kokoro Connect is great in all categories, its just not anything spectacular (Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\r\nI am an English teacher by trade (writer by fantasy).  I know what good character development is and how it is supposed to be done.  Although the techniques are gimmicky, and there are a few one note main characters (Aoki) i was still very impressed with the amount of depth delivered by the characters in this story.  More significantly, this was not the typical anime that made me roll my eyes at their behavior (most of the time).  When the inevitable love triangle presents itself, it makes sense.  When the guy starts choosing, it makes sense, when people get hurt- it makes sense.  When the drama and tension rises- it makes sense.  All of the characters motivations are not fully developed, but they are developed enough to make you care and not swoon over how contrived they are.  Again, for the genre and medium, this was an amazing job of characterization. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8\\n\r\nI have a short attention span when it comes to anime.  So when i actually watch all the episodes of a show (instead of wikipedia searching the plot til it gets to the good parts) i have to give that show high marks.  My favorite thing about this show is that it is an almost perfect length.  They dont draw out the inevitable sooooo long (I love you Toradora but im talking to you) and they dont end it anticlimactically  (every 3rd SOL romance does this).  The second to last arc was a little weak and less compelling and funny than the first two, but it was short and still entertaining.  Again, if you are looking for a  SOL/romance/comedy anime that doesnt make you embarrassed to be a fan with ridiculous characters, gratuitous fan service, and a blah ending.  You cant do much better than this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9",

            "content": "Is it just me, or do I only review shows beginning with the letter K?\r\nAnyway, just so you know, I'm also including the Michi Random specials in this review.\r\nStory: 10\r\nWhat would you do if you and your friends started randomly switching between each other's bodies?  Or if your deepest darkest desires were suddenly brought to the surface, out of your control?\r\nHere we have a series that takes a supernatural storyline, adds some well-written high-school romance and plenty of compelling drama, and pulls it all together into one amazing package.  Although some of the ideas may have been done many times before, Kokoro Connectmanages to make it fresh and funny, whilst also being surprisingly realistic with how it portrays the effects of each of the phenomena.  I felt the drama wasn't overdone at all and every arc introduced interesting new aspects of the story and allowed many sides of the characters to be shown.\\n\r\nUltimately, Kokoro Connect succeeds in blending its comedic school life shenanigans with more serious emotional moments, a testament to the quality of the writing and the great direction.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 10\\n\r\nI really liked the art for this series - everything is crisp and smoothly animated.  The characters instantly reminded me of K-On!, though upon checking, I was surprised to find that these two series don't actually have the same character designer.\\n\r\nThe settings are fairly detailed and we have some beautiful backgrounds and lush scenery.  As far as I could tell, there were no off-models or problems with animation.  \\n\r\nThe characters are all very expressive when they need to be.  Whether they are happy, angry, embarrassed or otherwise, their on-screen demeanours fit very well with the excellent voice acting.\\n\r\nWhilst I enjoyed the colourful and upbeat opening animation, it was the endings that really shone in my opinion.\\n\r\nOverall, Kokoro Connect is a very attractive looking show - Silver Link doing a commendable job here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe background music is great to hear; they fit the scenes nicely and add to the drama and emotion.\\n\r\nThe ending song also fades in before the ending animation, which I always find to be a nice touch when executed well like this.\\n\r\nMy personal favourites were the 2nd OP (Kimi Rhythm by Imai Masaki) and the 3rd ED (Salvage by Team.Nekokan [Neko] feat. Katakiri Rekka), though they are all really decent.\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, I think it was a job well done by all the seiyuu.  Even Heartseed with his tired, monotone voice I found to be sufficiently entertaining.  Throughout the series, a wide range of character traits and personalities were portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThe characters are what really make Kokoro Connect.  Unlike some other school-based romantic comedies, Kokoro Connect features fully fleshed out, three-dimensional people, each with very real pasts and flaws, which was what made me really care about them as I watched their story unfold.  They are apparently all somewhat misfits, so they form a Culture Club of sorts.\\n\r\nWithout going into too much detail, we have:\\n\r\nTaichi, an altruistic pro-wrestling fan who has a selfless urge to help others;\\n\r\nIori, a friendly energetic girl who is popular and loved by all;\\n\r\nHimeko, the cool and responsible one of the group, with considerable skill in information gathering and analysis;\\n\r\nYui, an expressive karate practitioner, who loves cute things;\\n\r\nand Yoshifumi - their casual friend, who is attracted to Yui (though she resists his advances).\\n\r\nI also have to mention one of the cutest imouto in anime - Yaegashi Rina - who is a caring sister that looks out for Taichi and, despite being younger, seems to give him advice about his relationships.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nKokoro Connect was really one of if not the best show of its season.  Watching the characters mature and develop was very compelling.  Over the course of the series, their pasts are revealed, along with their own shortcomings and how they overcome them.  The highlight is the character drama, and all in all, the series was practically perfect for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI have to say, Kokoro Connect is a must watch and I recommend it to everyone.  It was fully entertaining throughout.  As the supernatural phenomena start to take their toll on the five main characters - will their friendship be able to survive?  Join them on an emotional rollercoaster as you see them handle various unusual situations, all the while learning more about themselves and each other.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!

            "content": "Yet ANOTHER update on this review. This is one tricky anime to write a review on- Here goes.\r\nIn a school where extracurricular activities are mandatory, there exist five \"outlaws\". \r\nYaegashi Taichi, the pro-wrestling maniac\r\nNagase Iori, your typical spunky, bubbly, lovely character type\r\nInaba Himeko, the intelligent, cool computer expert... who is maybe just a tad bit too cool at times\r\nKiriyama Yui, lover of all things that are cute\r\nAoki Yoshifumi, frequently subject to rough treatment by the girls around him.\r\nThese five students form their own club, the \"Bunkenbu\" (Bunka Kenkyuu-bu)- and each day spent together is as ordinary as can be.\r\nUntil.\r\nKokoro Connect is best described as unique.It does not follow the plot of traditional romance anime, but instead, adds its own splash of color to what could have been considered \"trite and overused\". The first arc -Hito Random- sets the story off with the odd-at-the-very-least phenomenon of body-switching among the five main characters. Subsequent arcs deal with various phenomena (including a release of all desire and a manifestation of one's past self)- all quite intriguing and entertaining... but not limited to \"fun\"/\\n\\n\r\nWhile the events in Kokoro Connect are obviously not realistic, the audience is lead to think \"What if?\". Imagine suddenly being thrown into a mess of body-switching. Everyone has his or her own darkest secrets, desires, painful memories, and insecurities. Now, throw in the condition that four other people have access to all of the above  at any given time. These people are close friends... but can they really be trusted? Would you want them to know about your past? Your thoughts? Your secrets? The answer is probably \"Some things are better left untouched\".\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to a superb cast that really brings life to the characters, Kokoro Connect very realistically displays how a person would react when facing situations such as the ones listed above. It takes a concept that may sound lighthearted and shapes it into something deeper- even deeper and more complex than love ties that exist elsewhere in anime (which is saying quite a bit).\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect is a series I decided to watch on a whim after spotting it in CrunchyRoll one day, and I'm certainly glad that I did.\r\nI felt like the story was, by far, the stongest point of the series and what made it stand out from your average high school romance/drama anime. While the audience is never given a full and proper explanation of why the main cast suddenly find themselves swapping bodies with each other, reading the others' thoughts or acting on their supressed desires, among other things, all these events are handled really skillfully to flesh the series' themes out.\r\nAll the apparently bizarrehappenings have something in common: They force the main cast to lay their innermost emotions and struggles bare for their friends to see, no matter how much they might try to normally hide that side of them away, which is what prompts the others to try their best to help.\\n\\n\r\nThe way each character's problems were addressed was nice, and the characters felt relatable at most times. There were a couple of overly dramatic moments here and there, but I still felt like they worked well as set-ups for some really cathartic moments at the end of each arc.\\n\\n\r\nI've also got to commend the series on how it managed to ease the tension with comedic scenes that didn't amount to pandering to the audience. While there were a couple of scenes that stuck out as weird to me, I liked how the show was serious whenever it was addressing somebody's problems rather than just laughing them off with trope-ridden scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAbout whether I'd recommend this series or not, I'd say it depends on how much you care about series focused on character drama, since Kokoro Connect leans heavily on that. It felt like it didn't care all that much about explaining the bizarre happenings as much as it waned them to be there in order to explore each character and the bonds they make with their friends as a result of these trials they're put through.",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect is exceedingly mediocre. It is not bad by any definition of the term - the artwork, voice acting, and one particular character (you know who) are great and deserve commendation in an artistic medium saturated with high school romantic dramas. Additionally, the concept of body switching introduced for the first few episodes had a lot of promise and led to a lot of well-executed plot developments. The show never strayed into what could have easily been an ecchi bait premise and culminated in what was, to me, the climax of the show's story in Episode 5 with a (no spoilers) heart-wrenching decision tobe made by the cast members that actually made me pause and think what I would do in a similar situation.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the story and remaining characters of the show are mundane, unrealistic and at times even cringeworthy. I will preface this by saying that I am not Japanese - I am an American university student and a relative newcomer to anime. However, I have been around the block and have seen a few extremely well-done romance anime in the same vein as Kokoro Connect (Toradora!, Clannad, Monogatari), so I feel like I have a solid foundation upon which to base my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the story. As I mentioned earlier, the concept of body switching is actually a great idea and works very well in the high school drama setting. It is a mystery to me, then, why Kokoro Connect decides to just scrap it less than a third of the way through the show and change the supernatural events afflicting our main characters. There is so much untapped potential with the body switching premise that I would have loved to see. For example, much of the drama in the second half of the show could have been either avoided or played out much better if an extended body switch had happened between two characters that forced them to interact with the other's family, learning firsthand what their true daily life is like and further clarifying their root sources of trauma. Really, that's almost the entire point of body switching in a non-erotic setting - you are forced to spend a while in someone else's shoes and learn about them by living their lives. Instead we get mental thought transmissions and \"acting on your inner desires\". The first one is sort of interesting, but nowhere near as deep as body switching. The second one isn't even a supernatural phenomenon - it's called teenage hormones. I personally think this show could have done a lot more with 8-11 episodes of body switching only instead of dragging on for 17. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the main plot, it's mostly your typical Japanese high school romantic love-triangle borderline harem drama. There's supposed to be a main villain with Balloon Vine (Heartseed?), but there is really no point to his existence other to hand-wave away the phenomena as some kind of alien experiment. The point of this show is not explaining why these phenomena are happening, it's how the characters react to and deal with them together. You know at the end of the show you're going to get an official couple and that most of the character's problems will have been sorted out to some degree. I only wish that it didn't take so long to get there.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the characters, we come to what I think is this show's largest pitfall. The vast majority of the anime's cast are either as bland as raw pasta or act so unrealistically that trying to relate to them becomes nearly impossible. You've got Yaegashi, the stereotypical \"boku\"-using protagonist that espouses Japanese ideals of modesty, uprightness and chivalry while having practically no standout qualities whatsoever; Iori, a girl whose angst over her identity issues make for a very inconsistent and erratic character over the show; Aoki, the secondary male character and the only person preventing this from being a harem; Kiriyama, a girl with androphobia but whose solution to this problem is to be saved by others rather than confronting it herself; and Inaban, a strong female lead who is brutally honest, playfully violent and a breath of fresh air in an otherwise weak cast. Seriously, if you watch this show for anything, watch it for Inaban. She's great. \\n\\n\r\nThe only other person worth mentioning in the show is Balloon Vine, the main \"villain\" whose stated purpose for causing the supernatural phenomena to happen to our main group of five is literally just to fuck with them. Does this story really need a villain? The show does no legwork in explaining who he is or what motivates him to choose a group of Japanese high school students to experiment on, or why there is apparently a second, rival alien also involved with our main group. Kokoro Connect could have had effectively the same plot by just introducing the phenomena without any explained source and exploring how the characters react to it. \\n\\n\r\nThe ultimate reason why I did not enjoy this show was because these characters' dialogue and reactions to the phenomena felt incredibly unrealistic. Yes, this is an anime with body switching. Yes, there exist harem anime that I like, and the concept of a harem is constructed from male fantasy and is as far from real life relationships as possible. However, I feel that Kokoro Konnekt tries to pass itself as a somewhat true-to-life look at how a bunch of teenagers would act in supernatural situations but fails because it can't even master the portrayal of regular character interaction. Yaegashi is such a white knight that I wonder how anyone could have a healthy relationship with him; Iori is irrational even by teenage girl standards to the point where I can't even see why she does what she does from her point of view; and Kiriyama feels hypocritical in that she wants to become stronger and gain self confidence but instead relies almost entirely on Yaegashi for emotional support throughout the show. Even Inaban can act a little unrealistically sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Kokoro Connect is mediocre. Its higher than average production values, good voice casting and pretty good character in Inaban prevent it from being a failure, but so many other aspects of the show drag it down from being at least a decent watch. I cringed and interrogated my computer screen out loud multiple times while watching the show because I could not believe why certain characters acted the way they did or why certain parts of the show were just never explained. At the end I was left with a feeling of dissatisfaction and that my time should have been spent doing other things.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, I propose a drinking game whereby for every episode of Kokoro Kardashian you watch, take a shot every time you hear the word \"Tasukete!\", \"Mamoru!\", \"Suki!\", \"Daisuki!\", or \"Baka!. If you make it out alive, I will personally reward you with a medal.",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect begins with a pretty ordinary setting. 5 friends belonging to the same club with an absentee adviser, spending almost everyday loafing around. Then everything took a downturn when a mysterious entity named Fuusenkazura appeared and forced them into his game so they could entertain him. His \"game\" involves abnormal phenomena that often take place at random intervals. The first arc features body-swap, during which the 5 may switch bodies at random, and every arc that follows has them deal with other similarly bizarre situations. \r\nBefore anyone starts watching, all of this might sound pretty entertaining -- except each of these games that Fuusenkazurabrings them into produces big waves in their lives. Just imagine for a moment that your deepest secrets and darkest thoughts are dug out and exposed for your closest friends to see. Everyone needs to have a little privacy sometimes, but the games Fuusenkazura brings out always end up destroying their psychological defenses and put them in the spot to be honest with their friends, and also themselves. \\n\\n\r\nThrough the challenges the 5 of them face, the vulnerabilities of each person are shown to everyone else in the group. From there, the series soon turns into an emotional roller coaster that produces some serious drama. For the record, the drama doesn't feel forced at all. These characters are just what you'd expect of some regular high school kids who haven't had a firm grasp on their own identities. And it's the way they overcome each of these games and bond in the process that makes this series endearing. \\n\\n\r\nKokoro Connect is also no ordinary rom-com. There's romance and comedy, but the emphasis really ends up being emotional development more than anything. If you carefully chew through some of the things they say as they walk out of their slumps, you'll find nuggets of wisdom here and there applicable for just about everyone. The animation is decent and consistently fluid with no break in quality. The characters, while not necessarily coming out of unique molds, collectively form an lively, entertaining, and endearing cast. The plot is refreshing. The script is strong as well. Even though I personally found the soundtrack weak, it's a minor shortcoming in the face of everything else -- the story, the enjoyment, and the uplifting moments where they see the light at the end of the tunnel.\\n\\n\r\nTo close, I think Kokoro Connect is one of the most entertaining series I've picked up thus far, and I had a great deal of fun watching it. Simply put, it was a satisfying run. Although the format of struggle-then-triumph gets overused sometimes, the characters and the plot drive the series too well for that to interfere with the experience.  True, it's a bit heart-wrenching and depressing sometimes. At the end of the day though, it maintains a positive message throughout and is in my opinion a very well-crafted series that deserves almost everyone's attention. \\n\\n\r\n[Note: Although MAL separates the first 13 episodes of the series from the 4 episodes of \"Michi Random\" arc aired later on, the 17 episodes together feature an unbroken sequence of events and this review covers all of them.]",

            "content": "**Please take note: I am writing this review now, after seeing the first six episodes of Kokoro Connect. No spoilers are included in this review.***\r\nI decided to write this review because as I looked at the reviews for Kokoro Connect I noticed that many reviews were rated not helpful despite any good points the authors might have had. So I am writing to try and win over some readers and get people to at least try the anime. \r\nKokoro Connect is a story about five friends who end up experiencing an unnatural phenomena where they switch personalities with each other and have their friendship tested.At first the show seems like a slice of life anime with a nice gimmick, but this show offers more than that, I promise you. In just these first episodes the viewer is perplexed with the question of what makes up a person, their body or their personality? But the story continues from there as we see laughter, sadness, struggles with past experiences,current issues of self identity, relationships between friends, and much more. Lighthearted moments are shown mixed with deeper stronger emotional themes that have at points almost brought me to tears.\\n\\n\r\nStory- 9/10\\n\r\nOverall the story so far has worked out well and has been quite original. Kokoro Concect will have you on the edge of your toes the whole time. As I said earlier, you will see lighthearted moments as well as deeper emotional themes, all of which create a well balanced story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 10/10\\n\r\nAll of the characters in this show are likable and are well done. The characters have their place in the story and do not neatly fit into generic roles found in other anime. Some characters may be described as shy or strong-willed but they each have their complexities. I will not expand on the complexities the characters as to avoid spoilers, but you will see for yourselves. As for the character design, there is nothing to complain about. The characters are detailed and all fit their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 8/10\\n\r\nI am not and expert on animation art, but I can tell you the art in Kokoro Connect is decent. So far I have only seen this anime in 720p and I can say backgrounds are detailed, CGI is avoided, characters are detailed, and scenes are well animated. Overall the production values are decent with this anime, and the art does not distract or take away from the story or enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting for this show is spot on. The voice actors fit the roles of the characters they are portraying and are especially good at acting out scenes where personalities are switched between characters. There is not one annoying voice that distracts me from the story. As for music, The intro song is decent and the animation will make you smile. I do not listen to the outro very often, but it is decent as well. The soundtrack fits well with the tone of the show and is not intrusive to the viewers experience.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10\\n\r\nThis show has been very enjoyable to me. I actually care about the characters and want to see how they advance and develop. The plot has not been very predictable and has kept me intrigued.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10\\n\r\nI see no reason why anyone should not give this show a chance. So far, so good\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "High school is essentially one of the most important four years of someone\u2019s life. Throughout these years, not only does one fall under peer pressure, indecisive dramas, and separation into different clicks/social-groups, but you are often greeted with the unsatisfying feeling in overcoming mostly difficult, inexperienced tasks. However, the point of entering High School in the first place is to move onto secondary educations and learn not just fundamental cultures of others, but also about where you want to be in society for the rest of your life. During these times of hardships, not many people can gain true confidence; insecurities may rise from thepast, make many doubtful of themselves, and as a result contemplate loneliness, violence, etc.\\n\\n\r\nBut what every human really desires is the understanding of others; understanding of our flaws, weaknesses, highlights, memories, lusts, hatred, emotions, intelligence, shed tears, and acknowledgement in our refined existence. In other words, we want friends, people who takes pleasure in involving us in their lives.\\n\\n\r\nEstablished in the very High School setting, Kokoro Connect is an anime which explores the meanings of friendship in multitudes of emblematic, daring perspectives. Unlike other school rom-com anime, however, Kokoro Connect entangles its plot with dynamics by exposing the likes of evilness in characters and exaggerating certain aspects of the show to enhance not just enjoyment for the audience, but the substantiality in relationships as well. Absorbing the audiences with merely just its supernatural contents, Kokoro Connect also has a strong cast of characters to carry out its investigations of quarrels between the five trouble-children, who all happened to invest their free time into the Cultural Research Club. Of the group, the five members all embody several aspects of stereotypical adolescents. In short, there\u2019s the nice guy who apparently always finishes first (Taichi); his sidekick, who always pursues his crush regardless of circumstances (Aoki); the tsundere female archetype who, conveniently, is a black belt (Yui); an anti-social female who brings about justice in her own elegant ways (Inaba); and, the cute klutz archetype that always brightens up the mood with her visible smile (Nagase). However, there\u2019s always more than meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story steadily progresses, a creature going by the name Heartseed mysteriously brings about supernatural phenomenon in the group meant to somehow entertain it. Indeed, it did exactly that, and more. The first arc starts with the body swapping technique, where the group is challenged to understand the physical state of others in the group, their current family situations, and not misuse this opportunity for mischief. Unfortunately, even the slightest intervention of someone into your daily life could reveal subtle yet obvious problems one has. Eventually, the mental instability of many in the group begins to disclose, but luckily, friends are there to give moral support and justify the significance of their friends. It would\u2019ve been a simplex and sweet ending if the drama stopped there, but the injudicious Heartseed shows up again and screws everything up. From there on out, secrets of the past, dreams of the future, and the desires of the present are all exposed about each characters. Instead of hiding their fears, lustful thoughts, and ambitions, each character had to overcome their comfort zones, expose their contempt, true feelings for one another, and yet still wish for the acceptance of their friends. Since they're all teenagers exposed only recently to puberty, you could probably imagine what indecent, romantic thoughts some of these personal matters involved.\\n\\n\r\nAfter many of Kokoro\u2019s emotional roller-coasters, I became very attached to each of the characters. What Kokoro executes so well, not many productions can pull off easily. It develops each character into appealing people in some ways, and makes the audience so involved and invested in the emotional chaos the Series present. Perhaps due to their resemblances to realistic people, seeing Kokoro\u2019s characters make such human mistakes and overcoming it through genuine sentiments gave me a sense of responsibility, almost as if they\u2019re real-life, humane companions. Finally, the writers created dialogues which cleverly expressed some unique aspects of these characters and essentially, we gain our trusts of each eccentric person in the story through such techniques. For example; after several characters slowly developed aggressive, dementia-like traits due to Heart-seed's plans, it corrupted the healthy relationships between the Culture Research Club's members, instead of feeling mad or anger I felt sympathy towards the group just because of Kokoro's conventional script creations and its unhurried, deliberate pacing.\\n\\n\r\nBesides these shady dramas occurring on one side of the spectrum, Kokoro Connect usually has a rather lighthearted, Slice of Life vibe to compensate for all the suffering of these characters. The entrances of some of these comedy scenes are fairly coherent due to its consistency and the lighter weight on the dramatic side of it at first. But after Heartseed\u2019s introduction of deeper conflicts, I thought the comedy would just disappear from there or perhaps alternate into a realm of melodrama. Although Kokoro Connect inevitably executed some overly emotional scenes, the Show still managed to sneak in subliminal, dark humor and its ability to balance out the humorous yet intense sides of things impressed me. Without many spoilers, Kokoro tends to hinder at very humorous yet depraved concepts. Indeed, these comedic elements exceeded my expectation in how awkwardly situations elevated so quickly and became the most absurd stand-up comedies; yet, I don\u2019t think I ever laughed so hard in my life. The atmosphere, set-up, and state of affairs in these jokes all achieve perfection themselves, but the fact that these jokes even makes perfect contextual sense in the script-writing smothered my mind with enlightenment.\\n\\n\r\nDuring different times of the show where it required a certain type of mood, the animation was there to polish the atmosphere, especially with its apex of horrifying, variegated, blood dripping-like backgrounds. The character designs fared up splendidly with many embellished specialties among places where and when needed. Facial expressions and the blocking of characters also contributed to the comfortableness feel Kokoro sometimes had at first and its ability to immediately transfer that cozy texture into suspense. \\n\\n\r\nThe musical introduction added a nice vibe in the air with the OP, and concluded in a fashionable manner with the ED, both of which epitomizes typical, catchy, yet meaningful Jpop songs. Remarkably, the background music syncs with the elements of animation where required as well; during the committing of mischief, lighthearted music plays while dramatic, mawkish music spectacles uncertainty during climatic moments. Notably, voice actor(esse)s even gave spontaneousness and energy to their 2-D characters. In essence, the visuals and melodies ended up contributing very effectively.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Kokoro Connect, utilizing supernatural themes to its advantages, is a Series illustrating an accurate stance on the dangers and rewards of relationships. Through surreal artwork & humor it brings the seemingly two dimensional characters into life, and builds each character up with depth whilst still in correlation with the story-line. Although extravagantly detailed and over-dramatic at times, Kokoro still succeeds in coping with the balances of its several genres, and radiated powerful messages as intriguing as its provocative, headstrong humor. As an exceptionally done Slice of Life formulated Series; I recommend Kokoro Connect to anime fans who enjoys silly comedies, complicated High School relationships, and wouldn\u2019t mind challenging themselves with the concepts of true friendship, conformity, and being true to your instinctive, romantic feelings.",

            "content": "When I first heard the plot summary for Kokoro Connect I thought it sounded like some hentai series. Even if it wasn't, it seemed obvious that it would be a provider of ample fan-service, it of course wasn't though. After all, if you swapped bodies with someone of the other gender, what would be the first thing you do? \r\nYep, the obvious, see how well they masticate. Read it again, what were you thinking of? \r\nKokoro Connect revolves around the daily, not so normal lives of Taichi, Iori, Himeko, Yoshifumi and Yui and their encounters in the Cultural Research Club. Up until recently they thoughtthat they and their friends lived normal happy lives, but now the Heartseed is pulling their lives apart and exposing their inner secrets through body switching, urges and age regression.\\n\r\nThe love and teen pentagonal comedy follows the strange phenomena at the Yamahoshi Academy's Culture Club, starting with the five male and female club members switching bodies with each other.\\n\\n\r\nMix two parts school uniforms and setting, two parts moe, and one part original detail. Blend thoroughly. Serve warm.\\n\r\nProduction values are quite good, and there's a good level of detail to go around most of the time. Some scenes are picturesque. At other times, there's an unfortunate loss of detail in mid-ground elements that makes it difficult to focus, but this doesn't happen very often over the stretch.\\n\r\nWhile this is not a show whose events are ever intended to push aural or visual envelopes, Kokoro Connect is well-animated, and there is never a point where this show looks anything but nice. There is a bit of fan-service here and there but nothing so intrusive that it distracts from the relationship dynamics.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the animation, I am personally getting tired of the K-ON-like moe look; whether you like how the characters are designed is really based on personal preference. As for quality, Silver Link doesn't offer anything as stunning as a P.A. Works anime, but it manages to hold its own. There were no noticeable mistakes in body proportions, angles, or object size and the quality remains consistent throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nI have to commend the main cast for the first arc they essentially had to act as five (and in some cases six) different characters, since each character used the voice that went along with the body when they switched, and they all did a rather good job. I've heard some complaints that this studio Silver Link isn't known for hiring really great actors but I think they did a mediocre job this time.\\n\\n\r\nBoth OPs and EDs are quite catchy and serve well as introductions to the series though nothing to memorable. Sound effects are nothing remarkable but do their job throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nEverything this series does is for the emotional and dramatic effect, and thus the characters all have very interesting backgrounds. What the show does do a good job of, however, is not washing over things. Whatever happens to the characters their pain isn't easily fixed like some anime likes to do. Throughout the series you still see traces of the pain in the characters and that everything that has happened has strongly affected them one way or another.\\n\\n\r\nThey're forced to develop at a rapid pace is a direct product of the supernatural elements of the plot. The point can definitely be made that these elements are a contrivance. When it comes to the concluding arc I'd even tend to agree more often than not. That doesn't entirely eliminate the effect of more than half a season of strong build-up, however the worst thing for me was that, despite the title, I couldn't \"connect\" with any of the characters, they was more like actors interpreting their roles. Almost everything they said or did felt like forced for the sake of the plot, and Taichi out of them all, is just a place holder for a proper main character, as his personality was not actually explored.\\n\\n\r\nI appreciate that it had the guts to go for actual drama and to ask interesting questions.  Ultimately though, you have to deliver results.  I also think the series suffers quite a bit due to a cast that\u2019s fairly weak in the final analysis.  Taichi\u2019s issues I\u2019ve already covered, and with Inaba the problem was simply that I never liked her very much \u2013 she\u2019s easily the most clich\u00e9d member of the cast and I never really bought into her self-important self-pity and overcompensating and overbearing arrogance.  Aoki and Yui had a definable plot arc, at least, but they were largely plot devices, as Taichi was.  It was really only Nagase that emerged as both a likeable and well-defined character, and she too tended to be manipulated for the contrivance of the plot far too often.\\n\\n\r\nInteresting, original premise. Strong opening. Mediocre mid section. Poor ending. It's a downward slope all the way past the first arc - which is a real shame, because the initial episodes hint at the potential for a truly exciting series. Instead we're left with an unfinished mess that takes those pieces that had a chance at greatness and just kind of drops them on the ground.\\n\\n\r\nSo does will this series connect you your heart? Possibly. Perhaps not.\\n\r\nWill I stop with these stupid puns? Never.",

If you're into pointless high school drama, this show is for you.\r\nIn a phrase, this show is \"YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME!\" repeated for thirty minutes, seventeen times. The characters are repeatedly put into positions where it's determined (by the group) that they would all be better off if they talked about their feelings, and then proceed to not talk about their feelings. Everyone is a victim of some \"pressure\" from their friends, despite all of their problems being caused almost entirely by themselves. Everyone puts on some kind ofselfless front \"for the better of the group\" and inevitably makes things worse for everyone as a result.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is a cool premise, it's just that the characters are all irritating and incredibly dense. The art is solid, and the sound is good as well. The characters are what kill this show for me. All three girls complain that nobody will ever understand them because [insert any given problem], one guy is an annoying white knight type you'd see on a cosplay forum, and the other could be replaced by a sizable rock without changing the story at all.\\n\\n\r\nHow this show has anything above a five is perplexing to me.",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect is a rarity in anime.  It is a romantic drama that thanks to the strengths in its characters and writing avoids the annoying melodrama that shows like Golden Time and more recently Glasslip unfortunately fall prey to... For the most part anyway.  This can probably be attributed to its satisfactory pacing, which again is something quite a few shows in this genre seem struggle with.  The review will cover Michi Random as well.  Now on to the review!\r\nStory: Requires suspension of disbelief far too often, but is still well-written and well-paced.\r\nIts setup we see far too often in animethese days: A club of misfits have to deal with a fantastical situation that leads to drama and lighthearted comedic moments.  Not exactly treading innovative waters.  However, Kokoro proves that execution is everything by taking standard anime tropes showing you not everyone is so simple.  The plot starts off with the club members switching bodies seemingly at random.  At first this creates hilarity and confusion, but it isn't until later on we see the rather devastating mental  effect this can have on a group of insecure angsty teenagers.  Drama is handled in a mature, believable manner and was always entertaining to watch. Sexual tension is incredibly high in this anime which is a little odd, but makes the romance feel more authentic in my opinion.  The ending is strong as well resolving all conflicts between characters, but oddly not explaining the phenomenons that had been plaguing the our lead characters the entire show.    \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The definite strong point of the show.  Every single one is explored and developed thoroughly.\\n\\n\r\nYoshifumi Aoki- Master of nothing.  He's the most boring character in terms of.. well.. just about everything and relies on the rest of the cast to make him interesting (its even admitted in the show).  He does play a pivotal role in developing the rest of the cast and is actually well-developed character himself.  Just not an exciting one.\\n\\n\r\nHimeko Inaba- Master of being waifu material. As many who have actually seen this show to its conclusion will agree, Inaba is awesome.  She practically carries this show on her back just as she often tries to with her friends in the show.  I don't want to spoil too much since this shows plot is essentially its characters but she is a coodere.  Seems cold, uncaring, and methodical but in reality is still just girl with girl problems.  Something she is embarrassed to admit.\\n\\n\r\nYui Kiriyama- Master of Karate, but is actually the most vulnerable out of the five.  She tends to over think things to point where she almost always feels like a burden and her back story matches her present-day personality quite well.  Much like Aoki she is well-written but not that exciting.\\n\\n\r\nIori Nagase- Master of deception.  This character is best described as Chitanda (Hyouka) x Sengoku (Monogatari: Second Season).  She is cheerful, playful, and basically the opposite of Inaba although they still share a strong friendship.  Despite all of her upbeat antics she is subject of/to nearly all of the drama this series has to offer.  Because in this show not everyone is what they seem to be.\\n\\n\r\nTaichi Yaegashi- Master of wrestling.  Taichi is our main protagonist and is a \"selfless-freak\" in the words of Inaba.  She is correct.  \"Typical\" nice guy that wants to help everyone even if he knows attempting to do so will only cause them more pain.  His greatest strength is also is greatest flaw and that makes him pretty interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Effective at setting the mood.\\n\\n\r\nIts effective and timed well in all scenes.  It never out of place or disrupts the mood, but its nothing that I will ever remember now that the show is finished.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art is good, animation is pretty standard.\\n\\n\r\nEverything is well drawn, and character designs in particular seem to stand out, but the animation can be noticeably lackluster in some scenes.  It never was enough to take me out of the experience though.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: At just 18 episodes this show is more than worth your time.  And, Himeko Inaba is pretty damn awesome. \\n\\n\r\nWatch if you:\\n\r\n-Are tired of character tropes\\n\r\n-Enjoy an unpredictable, but not over dramatic love-triangle\\n\r\n-If Rom-drams are your thing (in that case why havn't you seen this yet!?)\\n\r\n-Enjoy supernatural anime \\n\r\n-Enjoyed Nagi no Asukara\\n\r\n-Want a climatic and conclusive ending\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch if you:\\n\r\n-Absolutely can not stand teenage drama\\n\r\n-Hate characters that tend to wallow in self-pity\\n\r\n-Don't enjoy drastic mood swings in your anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "NOTE: This review includes the 4 \u201cMichi Random\u201d episodes.\r\n\u201cWhat defines humans... Defines us? Nobody will notice a change on the inside if you look the same on the outside.\u201d\r\nWhat happens your desires and thoughts are no longer simply  your own, but are also shared with your closest friends? How will it affect your friendship when you uncontrollably make a move on the guy your friend likes, or even if you find out a dark secret that your friends kept from you? \r\nThese are all questions (among many others) which KokoroCo tries to bring to light. In a way, you could say this is asmuch a SOL-series, as it is a psychological test.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nThe basic plot is very simple, to be honest. A group of friends encounter, and have to deal with, a multitude of different phenomena which in different ways reveal their deepest desires and secrets to the other people in the group. However, it\u2019s the rather interesting way these phenomena are presented, executed, and dealt with which makes this show very interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEven though most of it can be pretty sad or depressing in ways, they\u2019ve done a good job in throwing in some comedic scenes, without making it feel like they\u2019re going out of their way just to be funny, so it all flows really well,  which I thought was nice. \\n\r\nI find it hard to actually talk more about the story, without really going into specific events and more detail, and unfortunately that would spoil the experience for you a bit.\\n\\n\r\nLength-wise, I think 17 (counting the specials) episodes were just perfect, and the sort of open ending both offers adequate closure and sets up for a good chance to read the remaining 7 books, I\u2019d assume (unless there\u2019s a lot of difference between the anime and the first 4 novels).\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nThe art was certainly very well done. (Like others, it seems) I was actually reminded of KyoAni\u2019s sort of \u201cspecial\u201d art style, but to my surprise, they weren\u2019t involved at all. Even so, all the characters were very well drawn (even the side-characters), and animation was nice and smooth. There are a lot of emotional scenes present, and whether a character was expressing happiness, sadness or anger, it was always done in such a way that it didn\u2019t feel \u201coverdone\u201d, or \u201coff\u201d in any way, which of course is a big plus.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I would like to point out is fanservice. Now, I\u2019ve gotten pretty used to seeing a fair share of fanservice in anime, even (or especially) in the ones revolving around a bunch of highschool friends. But to my surprise, there really isn\u2019t much of that to find anywhere here. \\n\r\nThere are maybe 3 or 4 very short scenes like these, and I found it very nice that they didn\u2019t try to break up the emotions with random boob-shots.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8 / 10)\\n\r\nOf course, in a show so focused on the emotional changes of our characters, good voice acting will be needed to really be able to bring the (very well done) writing to life, in a smooth and relatable way. To be honest, I really believe the voice actors all managed to do this.\\n\r\nThey all fit their respective characters very well, and to be able to display so many emotions throughout a rather short time, really takes a bit of effort. \\n\r\nThe one who stood out to me the most, however, was easily Nagase Iori. How she was able to both represent this happy, childish girl, as well as the cold, darker side of Iori we get to see was truly well done.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music; The background music did a good job at accompanying the writing, but it never really tried to overtake any other aspect, which was nice, and even if I personally didn\u2019t really care for the opening theme all too much, I think it shows the happy, hoping side of the group in a nice way. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nNow this is where things get really good. In short, the characters are all very well written and synergizes rather well with each other. At a first glance, most of the characters appear quite innocent and \u201cplayful\u201d (for lack of better words), except for maybe Inaba, who acts as the stern leader of the group. However, as the story goes on, darker sides are revealed, and as we find out more about each characters backstories, you learn that they\u2019re not quite as innocent and/or happy as they\u2019d like you to think, and this is all what makes you care and feel for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, a show about being forced to reveal your darkest secrets wouldn\u2019t be very interesting if said secrets were all kinda \u201cmeh\u201d, would it? Thankfully, all of the characters (save for one, I guess) have rather good backstories, and this also contributes a lot to character development. As they struggle to overcome their past problems/traumas, they actually develop as characters, and synergise with the other characters in new ways, which again brings up a lot of new scenarios.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9 / 10)\\n\r\nTo be honest, I\u2019m usually not able to marathon shows if I\u2019m watching them by myself (as I easily get distracted in between episodes), and in that case, it usually takes me a while to finish a series, because I don\u2019t necessarily always feel like watching anime at that moment. However, there are exceptions to this, and KokoroCo is definitely one of those. Even if I didn\u2019t marathon all the 17 episodes in one go, I certainly got through this a lot faster than many other series, because I kept feeling like I wanted more of the characters, and wanted to see what would happen next etc. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it\u2019s rather bittersweet, but I think this was very close to being one of my favorites.",

            "content": "\u201cOne of the most beautiful qualities of friendship is to understand and to be understood.\u201d\r\nWhat Kokoro Connect essentially delves into, is exactly that, the notion of what friendship is, and how do we keep it alive when your true desires, love, selfishness, fears, pasts and fragility are all unleashed and out in the open. \r\nOne day a sudden paranormal occurrence of body-switching haunts a small group of five friends, which in turn alters their relationship and every day lives. \r\nSince the plot is pretty much straightforward with a slight twist, Kokoro Connect is more of a character motivated Anime; with it being more ambitiouson the interactions and chemistry front between the characters. I think the characters are not only convincingly believable, but have a real depth and insight to them; (Yui; androphobia, Iori; multiple personality disorder?) we truly see a good portrayal of emotions and human nature.\\n\\n\r\nThe supernatural occurrences definitively disrupt the harmony amongst the five friends as it not only, sends their feelings in turmoil, but also makes them closer friends simultaneously. The initial idea of body-switching is, in itself a charming premise but also happens to open a can full of funny situations too, as you can imagine.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I also liked was the atmosphere that Kokoro Connect gives; the orangey sunset sceneries at the beginning feel reminiscent of high school nostalgia with intentions to keep it light-hearted. Alongside that, there is also an eerie, sinister tone when the entity Heartseed enters the fray (his gormless, creepy, unpredictable look about him also contributed to this xD). That is certainly one factor that kept me interested, the eagerness to find out what is behind the mysteriousness and ambiguity of this Heartseed entity that was causing all the supernatural phenomena, the enigma of his powers, what he actually is and what his real intentions are. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough those are the defining factors I liked in particular, there are also many evident blemishes I could also point out. Being a slice of life drama set in the high school timeframe following both female and male students there are predetermined hints to your conventional genre clich\u00e9s, we have seen it all to often with the overplayed depictions of love triangles and pour-your-heart-out, lovey-dovey confessions scenes; all I can say is Kokoro Connect doesn\u2019t differ from this nor does it attempt to, while it tries not to overly focus on these things, the fact remains is that these overdone concepts are embraced, and the way it\u2019s pulled off may be too generic for some. \\n\\n\r\nWe also have the character designs and art style that are nothing special to be honest; all plainly bland looking, nothing outstanding, it\u2019s what you would expect from most other Anime. The characters themselves could also be considered clich\u00e9, as you might say it features some of your common personalities in Anime shows, although I still think it\u2019s one of the more stronger aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the general premise of the Anime starts quite well, what with the body-swapping idea, it eventually moves onto other mind-boggling notions. With the original idea still fresh in your mind, I feel the episodes gradually drop its appeal with each supernatural premise, and swings its tone to a less light-hearted, funny atmosphere to a more darker and dampening one at the ending stage of each phenomena; this also inserts more exaggerated, melodramatic and overemotional moments. Although this tonal shift could in my opinion be handled in better fashion, it also effectively brings in, deeper more meaningful themes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the most unsatisfying thing was undoubtedly the ending, lets just say there are so many unanswered questions and left with a sense of bewilderment and discontent. (This thing really irked me xD)\\n\\n\r\nSo, all in all \u201cWhy should I watch this?\u201d you maybe thinking, well if you enjoy a well thought out Anime, which makes you think about the real meaning of friendship and puts you into empathetic scenarios, albeit engaging you into an emotional roller-coaster of a drama with heartwarming conclusions at times, while still keeping it funny and light-hearted, then I say go for it!\\n\\n\\n",

Maybe a lot of shoujo vibes, with a lot of fluff and comedy. But what I got was that, and then some. \r\nI won't go too much into detail, because that's spoiling, but I just keep getting more pleased with this anime as the episodes continue to air. It starts off as a normal school life anime, and then BAM, plot twist, and your entire perspective is thwarted. In a goodway, of course. \\n\\n\r\nI desperately recommend everyone to watch this, because it's really good. Even if shoujo isn't your thing; you can't really consider this a shoujo. Think of it more as...a school life comedy with some of it's deeper moments thrown in.",

The story at first was all about friends sticking together and never giving up no matter what and then it just kept flipping from wanting to be a drama to a romance back to a drama.  \\n\r\nArt:5\\n\r\nThe art doesnt stand out at all because most of it is a 2 shot in a classroom so randomly the animation will spike up at times.\\n\r\nSound:3\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is either non existent or just so bland that I dont even notice it while watching and the opening and ending themes are your typical drumbeat in the background with some violins and lyrics about lover.\\n\r\nCharacters:2\\n\r\nI cant put to words how much I dislike every character in this anime, well Im going to try. First off their is Aoki who is non existent through 90% of the anime, Inaba who is the only slightly likable character but then she ruins most of her credibility with that certain quote in that certain episode, Yui who's only contribution to the anime is breaking a table and getting kicked in the balls, Iori who has a major personality complex and thinks she isnt herself because of it, Taichi who is your typical save everyone character and is the worst out of everyone and sadly gets the most airtime next to Iori.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nIm not gonna lie this anime was very good at the beginning but after a few episodes you can predict everything that will and can happen.\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nThis anime had so much potential but it just fell short almost like they switched writers and decided to take it in a whole new direction.",

From time to time, they exchange souls or you may also tell bodies, depending on 'someone'.

This is the only spoiler I will provide. \r\nArt: 6\r\nThis is the same studio that brought you guys gems like Usagi Drop, and Bakemonogatari, the latter of which got uber bonus points for style without having to dump too much into the art budget. KC however, is more like Usagi in that itisn't known for its art. Don't get me wrong, the characters do still look good, despite the mundane setting & background.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is mediocre, and if you pay close enough attention, you will notice that the creators cut corners in some scenes by using the same sequence of images over and over again. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\n1st opening theme is pretty catch, as was the 1st ending theme. \\n\r\nI don't really remember the other theme songs in the series. Background theme's within each episode fit the tone/mood of each scene fairly well. \\n\r\nOverall, the music and sound effects did their job, but nothing that really blew me away. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nSome viewers may dock a few points for the characters being a bit 1-dimensional in the beginning. But I justify my 10/10 in that I was absolutely floored by how these characters developed throughout the series. Whether it is the rich back-story of each character (minor one's too !) , or the fluidity with which these characters interact, it is clear that the makers put a lot of effort into creating people out of the main protagonists, as opposed to archetypal and cliched caricatures.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI laughed, I cried, I wanted to watch it again, nuff said \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI took the average of the previous 5 and added 1 because the characters were just that strong. I believe that it is the people that drive a series. One can create an absolutely ridiculous universe that transcends all suspension of disbelief, but still have awesome characters that really absorb viewers into that universe. Kokoro Connect's star characters did precisely that for me, and i hope it does for those of you reading this review! \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "There is alot to say about Kokoro Connect, it was a rather odd, yet extremely enjoyable experience for me. I can kind of understand why this anime gets alot of flak from people, but that's not the animes fault, the problem that the anime \"has\" isn't a problem at all, it's disliked in the same way school days is, not because it's badly designed, but because it's something people don't like. People confuse something as being bad because they don't like it, but that couldn't be farther from the truth, hopefully my review sheds some light on this anime and can help anyone that's onthe fence about it make their mind up, also this is for the  whole anime, that includes the 4 \"extra\" episodes, they are essential the story and should have been aired at the same time as the original anime, but for some reason it wasn't. \\n\\n\r\nStory- The story in Kokoro connect is different from how the synopsis describes it, that's part of it, but now what the story is just about. They go through certain \"tests\" as a group, the first being randomly body swapped, i'm not going to spoil what the others are, but stuff like being able to hear the other members thoughts happen as well, it's actually a really good idea and makes for a very intense and interesting story. I would definitely call it one of the more uniquely written stories out of all of the anime I have watched. The story has it's ups and downs as far as emotions go, it has it's funny moments that are hilarious in their own respect and it also has some very touching and emotional scenes, and the best part is that these scenes are perfectly balanced, it never feels like it should have been serious when it was being funny and vice versa. I was expecting the story to be kind of shit and just nonsensical like some people have said, but I found it to be the opposite of that. It was wrote extremely well, had plenty of varying issues that they had to overcome, had great character interactions, no down time, stayed interesting all the way through, the only part of the story you could complain about was something that happened down the line, which is how it's suppose to be. Not all anime is suppose to make you feel good about yourself, some stuff is suppose to do the opposite and make you feel like shit, make you feel anger and resentment, it's suppose to make you feel a variety of emotions, some examples of anime like this that are misunderstood would be something like school days, or even aku no hana to an extent. All of that being said I think the story is amazing, even that part that made me start hating a certain character, it was suppose to be that way. The ending was something I was worried about, I always worry about the ending to animes because it seems like alot of really good anime are spoiled by a shit ending that makes no sense or leaves off on a bad cliffhanger, but not kokoro connect. It had a very satisfying ending, it told it's story and didn't decide to drag itself out and over stay it's welcome like a lot of anime seem to do nowadays. \\n\\n\r\nArt- The art is nothing special, it's your average run of the mill anime type art style with nothing special about it, which works in it's favor. You really get the sense that this is happening to a regular group of friends, which I think adds to the overall feel of the anime in a positive way.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The op/ed sountrack is pretty good, it fits the feel of the anime really well. The music scores are on queue everytime and simply adds more to scenes. It's kind of hard to mess up the sounds assets of anime nowadays, also dat sax solo. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The characters in kokoro connect are arguably more important than the story. The entire show is based around this group of friends finding out more about each then they were supposed to, if the characters are boring and uninspired then the show would be trash. They all have something about them that makes them unique in some way, which can be hard since there are 5 main characters. They all feel as fleshed out as characters and you can see them change in believable ways that don't break the story or immersion. Some anime doesn't do this, they make the character do something they wouldn't normally do, or they make them into a badass when they were originally a geek or something along those lines, it's immersion breaking when that happens and it ruins the anime for me most of the time. Being that there are 5 main characters that are fully fleshed out, that makes for a really good time. You know these characters on a deeper level so when something funny happens you find yourself laughing with them at what happened and when something tragic happens you find yourself being depressed about it. The characters and story are what this anime as amazing as it is, without the interesting characters to support the awesome story it would fail, and vice versa. They have a perfect harmony and pace that is refreshing to see, not many anime get the pacing and character interactions right, but this one does and i'm glad I took the time to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- There is no downtime in this anime, something interesting is always happening and you're never left having to watch a few filler episodes to get to the good parts of the anime. Watching these 5 characters just interact with each other is fun enough, throw in a well realized story that never stops with the curve balls and you have yourself a fantastic anime along with an experience that you won't be able to forget. This anime never lets up, and that's one of it's best qualities, non-stop entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Overall I was quite surprised by Kokoro Connect, I often find that alot of controversial anime usually either sucks or is awesome, and I always love it when i'm wrong about an anime, it's the best feeling in the world. I'm so glad I decided to watch it, it was highly enjoyable, well made, well designed, excellently executed, and enjoyable to boot. If you enjoy mystery, romance, or just plain weird anime that is designed well then kokoro connect is a must watch. It's something unique, it tells a story that no other anime has come up with before and makes it awesome. Romances are a dime a dozen, same with high school slice of life, but this one breaks that monotony and tries something new, and definitely succeeds. Watch it now if you like what you've seen here, or hell , just try it if you're looking for something new to watch, you won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "Note: At the time of writing this review, i have only watched up to 11 episodes. Thus, the review might not be too accurate as more episodes air, but i will try my best to give a good review with my understanding of these first 11 episodes. (at the time when this review was initially written, it was only 6 episodes watched, i added in several things about the new arcs in the series this time round.)\r\nTo be honest, Kokoro Connect was not in my list of anime to watch for the season initially, nor did it catch my interest at first. When reading thestory synopsis, i was expecting it to be a light hearted series overall with mainly humorous events when the characters swap their bodies. \\n\\n\r\nHow wrong i was.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes pace pretty quickly as the anime starts to get dark. This whole body swapping business starts to get worse as time progresses with even more implications in the daily lives of the characters, as well as how they interact with one another. For those who like a fair share of drama in their anime, Kokoro Connect is your cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have shown distinct character development as the story progresses. We get a deeper look into their lives, and their personalities as well. We come to understand why the characters behave the way they do because of circumstances in their lives, and that makes the viewer attached to the characters. We can emphatise with them, and it draws us in to want to watch even more.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime enters a new arc in episode 6. Just when we thought body swapping was the worst it could get, the series throws us another curveball. This lets us think even more deeply to what might happen to the characters we know and like. Kokoro Connect sure is addictive to watch.\\n\\n\r\nUnleashing your true desires makes you aware of how you really feel and what you really want. However, it brings fear at the same time. Fear of unleashing these desires at the wrong time. Its interesting to see how the characters cope with the inevitable, as even though there is the fear of being unable to suppress one's true desires, one cannot distance themselves from people forever. All humans are sociable in nature and enjoy company. No matter how anti-social a person is, he/she will get lonely eventually. We gain a nice insight on how the characters takes things in their stride and face the events that happen in their life, as well as how events slowly unfold and true feelings are revealed.\\n\\n\r\nCoincidentally, episode 11 is another new arc, where the characters periodically revert back to their young selfs for a few hours at a time. The catch is that they are able to remember things from when they are young even after they revert back to their original selves. This brings forth a lot of new possibilities. Everyone has things from the past which they want to conceal from others, as well as themselves. Everyone wants to avoid thinking about bad memories from before. However, as memories from the past surface and haunt the characters again, how will they deal with it? Will they stand up to it bravely, or will they shy away and avoid the truth? We shall see in the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn my case, Kokoro Connect is a hidden gem. If you are a person who likes a nice mix of drama and humour in the premise of high school life, i definitely recommend Kokoro Connect. I enjoyed every minute of it (even when up to episode 11 so far), and i'm sure you would too.",

            "content": "**Takes into account of the 4 extra episodes.\r\nKokoro Connect is an anime that is not going to appeal to everyone. Why? Because many episodes are dedicated to the characters and how they deal with their inner conflicts and problems. Of course on the surface their daily lives are not anything interesting until Heartseed greets them and they are faced with certain phenomenons which force them to change. And how they change is the true gem of this show, as it becomes from any other slice-of-life to a supernatural and mysterious that drags viewers in.\r\nThese unusual phenomenons range from switching minds in bodies and to givein to their impulses, something very haunting the characters find themselves losing control of who they are or who they thought they are. How would people react if they did not have authority over themselves? What if someone was able to get in your head? Listen to what you truly think? It's a scary thought as it stripes these characters bare, revealing their true personalities. It tests their trust, friendship and commitment. But most important of all - their identities. How truly fragile is a person's personality? How genuine? How easily can you deceive, lie and fool someone when wearing a mask?\\n\r\nThere is one way to describe what these phenomenons affect the characters and its this:\\n\r\nIt destroys them, absolutely breaks them apart. They corrupt in their own insecurities and struggle trying to overcome it. Their protections, barriers are all torn down and the question is - how do they deal with it? \\n\r\nThat's where it gets gripping and compelling because they make us question ourselves.\\n\\n\r\nAs I've said before, since this anime is so heavily based on their characters - many episodes come across as \"fillers\" but they are all very important to their progression.\\n\\n\r\nThere are 5 characters in this anime - with 13+4 extra episodes I didn't expect anything extraordinary, what could they do with characters with such little time? I was very wrong.\\n\r\nAoki:\\n\r\nA free character, seems careless and carefree he tries to live with no regrets - unfortunately, he seems to bring mayhem everywhere and his way of living is portrayed very reckless; unaware of how his decisions affect those who are around him. I thoroughly enjoyed watching him try to find a deeper understanding of himself. It is powerful to see one find the source of their true feelings.\\n\\n\r\nKiriyama:\\n\r\nVery kind and gentle, Yui is sweet and generally, another light-hearted character. In fact I believed she would be a dull character, expecting her to just be that cute one. But Kokoroco does not fail and we get to see her true fear: one she has buried for so long. Watching her trying to overcome this was both painful but reassuring.\\n\\n\r\nInaba:\\n\r\nThough coming across a bit too honest and controlling - she is very logical and calm towards situations that require analysing. But can you analyse your feelings? Can data predict how you feel? Inaba is a complex character, that I had trouble understanding. A very mysterious character with many insecurities hidden by arrogance you can almost feel a sense of relation to her, she gave me one of the best impressions and her development was truly something else.\\n\\n\r\nIori:\\n\r\nNow a character that needs time to wrap your head around, the development dedicated to her was at times too rushed but I believe, necessary. Identity, individuality, all tricky elements to a persons personality. How they perceive themselves and project themselves to other people. Now this was a character with immense depth, honest and brutal, I am sure anyone will enjoy watching her unfold.\\n\\n\r\nTaichi:\\n\r\nYour typical, selfless and considerate main character - come on, we've come across this type of protagonist countless times. Noble. Generous. He's a character you'd roll your eyes at: you think, come on, you have to be selfish somehow. But this character gives you a gleam of hope, he was fleshed out to the max. Unlike the other characters, his struggle was perhaps too much of a thing.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime did not forget any character and gave its cast the proper time it needed to mature and grow. Their flaws, strengths and deepest fears. Everything is exposed that viewers truly feel with them, you can easily relate with how they react even if you have not experienced it before.\\n\r\nWhile the story can seem as some sort of prop to be used for character development, their is a mist of mystery and suspense around it's events that are overlooked. Definitely unpredictable, this anime is an emotional ride. The individual elements of comedy, action and romance are paced carefully well.\\n\r\nIn a more critical view, the plot/storyline is not explored completely and seems to be only used as some sort of device for the characters. The actual process of the phenomenons and explanations are very vague and even Heartseed himself is unknown and peculiar. That may be annoying to some, as its core is not clear or comprehensible which makes rooms for misunderstandings and plot holes.\\n\r\nThere are endless possibilities, choices to do with this anime, so it makes sense that it appears too slow-paced or boring as it does explore many of the components. \\n\r\nBut the characterization is something that can't be missed out on.",

            "content": "As there is only one episode out currently, this review will be updated as the series continues. \r\nWhat does it take to know another person completely? Hopefully some time spent talking, laughing, and making memories with one another would be enough. However, the kids of Kokoro Connect are about to know much more than they ever wanted to about one another. \r\nI can honestly say hat I've never run across a STORY like this one before. I'm careful when addressing \"slice of life/comedy\" animes, as they all seem to harbor the same thoughts, elements and general feel. However, as I continued to watch the firstepisode, I started to see some potential. That potential came with the \"Freaky Friday\"-type idea, that I've personally never seen done in an anime before. I was instantly captivated by the plot, earning a 9 in the story category. I can genuinely say that this is going to make for a funny show. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the ART, I'm not a fanatic about the K-ON style that so many animes have adopted recently, but I don't dislike it, either. But what Kokoro Connect failed to do was at least bring the glossy, polished feel to their show that was expected. While the color pallet is pretty, it doesn't look as finished as I would normally like. I suppose I'll get used to it, though. It is over-all not Kokoro Connect's strongest asset, earning a fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND is okay; not really much to say. A bright and happy OP that I will hopefully not end up skipping. The ED is fine, too. At least its not overly annoying. Aside from the theme songs, the OST was very nicely done in the first episode, using clever entrances and drop-outs that turned out to be very comical! Over all sound, I give it a 7.\\n\\n\r\nEven though it was only the first episode, the CHARACTERS do show some promise, even though there are some typical archetypes. In Kokoro Connect, you get your expected serving of an energetic female lead, mixed with what appears to be two female tsunderes (one being more so than the other), with two honest boys. I don't feel quite that it is quite apt to judge in this category, since its very hard to have deep character growth or portrayal in the first episode, but I will tell you this: the characters are entertaining, earning at solid 8.\\n\\n\r\nMy ENJOYMENT settles at a positive 9. This anime has done something which many in the past have failed to do, and that is captivate me with their plot line.. Not their beautiful graphics, nor their likable characters (although neither of those are bad) which usually keep me watching a show, but instead, the wonder of what is going to happen concerning plot. \\n\\n\r\nMy overall feel is that it looks to be a promising show! I look forward to more episodes coming out each week. Its definitely a show worth a try.",

            "content": "I've already finished this series, and the last 4 as well. I would like to post my review on the 1st 13 episodes. Since Kokoro Connect really made my day. And I want to share it with everyone who are thinking about watching this truly amazing anime.\r\n There are so many things I can say about this anime. But to be on the safe side I won't say any spoilers to first time watchers. I would rather want them to watch it themselves to see how great this anime really is. You guys should already know the Plot of the story. But I wouldlike to give you guys my outlook and impression on how Kokoro Connect left for me.\\n\\n\r\n The reason I made this account is because of this anime \"Kokoro Connect\". I've seen a lot of anime, enough that I understand that it's pretty redundant, and repetitive how most animes are. But, hey it's not my kind of preference. I'm not picky. I enjoy all anime, even though it's not my taste. I'll always give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\n I gave this anime all 10. Not just because it's perfect in every way, no anime is perfect. It's doesn't matter how the sound, or quality it's in. What matters is how the anime gave you that \"feeling\" in the end. How it impacted on the audience, how it will end with a strong impact that leaves your mind lingering. Any anime that does that to me is what I consider an amazing anime, and this anime is the perfect example of that. Kokoro Connect.\\n\\n\r\n Kokoro Connect definitely succeeded it's purpose on expressing my emotions. The impression it gave made me view life in a different aspect. It taught, and gave me a realization that this is how humans are. We're powerless. Even when we try to settle things all by ourselves. We will always need someone in our lives to help us at one point. Life just works that way. This. Is. How. We. Are... No one can live all by themselves. We will always strive for love and comfort. These are human instincts. Hardships will always come. But everyone will always get through it. Just when you are about to break. Your friends will always be their to help you up, and that would be one of the great aspects of Kokoro Connect.\\n\\n\r\n This had to be one of the strongest point this anime has shown me, Inspiration. It inspired me to become a better person! and obviously changed my perspective on how life is! If it doesn't with you? well... I doubt it. I wouldn't say this is the grand of grands of all animes. But I think any anime should strive to become like Kokoro Connect An anime that encourages oneself in a more positive way.  All an all it's rare to watch any anime that are like this. Veryyyy rare. I highly recommend it! it'll definitely will be in my memories forever. I'll never forget it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Friends... What can we do without them. I thought at first that Kokoro Connect was going to just be pure romance, but I was totally wrong. This anime truly brought about the emotion that the characters are feeling in to play. I would say that those who want something realistic probably don't wanna try to watch this, because it's filled with phenomenon, which I believe could be possible in a way. In any case, Kokoro Connect is a great anime, with amazing drama scene for viewers to enjoy. So if you like drama, romance, and some comedy, only some, then I really recommend this toyou. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nI've been seriously trying to find an anime that's like this for such a long time. The emotion that was in this anime was just enough to match many others that could be considered the best. The plot was arranged perfectly. Not too fast and not too slow. It might not be as sad as Clannad, but it may match it in terms of friendship wise, or relationship. For me, I personally like it because it explained so much about friendship, and how that bond could overcome many obstacle, as long as it doesn't break. I'm not sure if it's just me or not but I don't really like how they start off the anime. I'll give it about average, but since episode 1, everything after that was just amazing. Kokoro Connect exceeded my expectation, since they put \"new\" ideas that they came up with to build such a great anime. That's just my opinion, since this anime is probably one of those anime where you either like it or you don't. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art style looks very adorable, cut, smooth, and very eye catching. I'm not so good on the art and animation stuff, but I think that the color, texture, and the motion of the movement characters make are very well made. That just might be where I watch the video though. Since the art looks like K-On, I though it was just going to be a nice, happy, and romantic anime with good comedy, but now I realize that this art style really fit into making the tears of the characters looks more \"realistic\". What that means is, not a Huge amount of tears flying around, comedy wise, or just a touch of tears, making you feel only a little heart breaking. Not all that, but instead, it brought out the true emotion of how the characters, or should I say, how the people should really feel, the serious emotion that all anime should have in order to make viewers sob over it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe voice acting and background noise is really, really realistic. In some anime, they tends to bring emotion, or how serious the situation is in the scene by adding either serious, sad, or funny background noise. Sometime they over did it and it sounds too serious than it was suppose to. I'm sure this happens to some of you. One minute ago you just watch and watch and sometime doesn't even realize the background noise, but a second later you just realize it since the sound doesn't match how serious the scene should have been. Kokoro Connect is what I believe to have an outstanding quality in sounds. The timing and all were very well arranged to where it's suppose to be, and the background noise isn't what really set the mood, but the voice actor who really put their feelings into every word that they spoke. This anime had a great voice actors and a great sound track which is why I gave it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI probably said this already, but the characters is the subject which is the building block to make an anime good, and the voice of each individual characters brought lots of emotion to the listeners, which makes the anime more realistic in terms of life situation, if this was actually going to happen. This is another anime which I believe to not have that bad of an annoying characters, but I do admit that some characters could really get out people's nerves. But that is what they want you to feel, which is great in another way. The role characters have really fit with the situation that they're in. When characters cry, they could be annoying for other anime, but Kokoro Connect made sure that you Will feel sad when you actually pay attention to the scene and what's going on. This certainly doesn't apply to everyone, but only those who truly believe in friendship, and how hard life can be if no one support you. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis anime certainly made my week, and a great start for new year, even though it's been a couple weeks past new year, and this anime came out in 2012. I've been watching many, many sad anime over a year or two, but this anime really bought me closer to tears than any other (doesn't apply to Clannad, 5 centimeters per second, or some others which I forgot). So I believe That to be the reason why i gave this a 10 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nMaybe I grade this a little too high, but in my opinion, it truly is a great anime which I would totally hope for more. If you read this review and gotten to this far, thank you for reading. I don't really care if you agree or not with me, but no one can change who you really are, so you can say this is either helpful or not, but I hope it did help even if it's just a little bit.",

I'd like to see more body swap shennanigans, but at the same time, I'm glad they didn't milk it.

Also please keep in mind that this is my first review and I'm still relatively new to anime. \r\nStory\r\nThe story is driven by the five main characters, the different phenomenons that happen throughout the series and how they affect their relations. This is due to Balloon Vine (a weird \"being\" that can take control of people's bodies) causing the phenomenons. Sometimes a few side characters are involved, but they are usually only there to add a bit of comedy. That is fine, asthe main characters are well designed and not paper thin. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nI really liked the characters. Even though they are based on existing archetypes, they manage to bring something new here. They build each character from ground up, showing their problems and pasts. The characters definitely are the thing that kept me interested. I'm not gonna spoil anything, as the story depends on character development. All the characters go through some change during the series.\\n\\n\r\nYaegashi Taichi - He's your typical nice guy type character. I'm usually not big on them, often ending up hating them. However, this one was different, without spoiling anything.\\n\\n\r\nNagase Iori - She's the cute and energetic type. At least, she starts out as one. \\n\\n\r\nKiriyama Yui - She's your delicate character and a karate trainee.\\n\\n\r\nInaba Himeko - She's the tough, cool chick. Again, changes during the show. Also my favourite character. \\n\\n\r\nAoki Yoshifumi- I suppose he's the pervert type. That is not flaunted though, only in a few instances does he act perverted. He also gets beaten up by the girls. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nNo complaints here. I'm not too picky on art, as long as it's watchable, which it most definitely was. It was clear, not that detailed though. I feel like it does the job. Art isn't a deal breaker for me anyway. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI don't care much for anime openings or endings, so I'll let you judge those. The actual music during the show was really good and fitting, though. The VAs did a good job in my opinion, no complaints. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Kokoro. I was always wanting to see what's going to happen next, watching all of the 17 episodes on almost one sitting. There were no filler episodes, never a dull moment. The pacing was perfect in my opinion, it didn't feel rushed nor did it feel like it was dragging on too long. The conclusion in the end was satisfying and I didn't feel like it should've continued. Kokoro is definitely going to my top 3 ever, possibly the best I've watched so far. \\n\\n\r\nI can't really say anything bad about this series. I did get annoyed a few times when the characters did something stupid a real person would never have done, but that's just me, not bad design necessarily. I highly recommend this to anyone, even if you're not a big SoL fan. If you want to shed a few tears while watching a good story unfold, go for it!",

            "content": "\"A friend is someone who knows all about and still loves you\" ~Elbert Hubbard\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story in this show is pretty good. I'm not calling it special, but it gets the job done and provides a stage for the characters. There are a few plot holes and some things that are unexplained but is not dull of boring. Overall, the story is above par compared to other school drama, slice of life and supernatural anime. \r\nArt/Sound:7/10\r\nThe art in this show is consistent through the show and is enjoyable to see. That being said, the animations not perfect. However, for 2010 this shows art style wasgood for a TV aired show. For the sound, It was ok. The first OP was catchy and captured the lighthearted aspects of school drama of this show. On another note about the music, the tracks in the OST did their job but were forgettable making the sound the weakest part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIn a show revolving around friendship and character development, this show delivers strong and provides strong characters and well thought out backstories. The development for each and every one of the main characters was unbelievable. I found myself caring for the characters and felt as though I knew them personally. Towards the end of the series, I felt as though they were my friends and when the series ended, I felt as though I had just moved away. The backstories of each character was touching in their respect. Without spoiling this, I would just like to say that the character who's story touched me the most was that of Iori Nagase. I did like Inaba's backstory the best because I was able to relate it to my own life the most. Overall, my only gripe on the characters was Taichi's development. As a viewer, he was the character I learned the least  about in the show that was of importance. However, that does not take away from the great character development. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI have always been a sucker for school drama's in anime. This being said, I enjoyed this show quite a bit. There is a supernatural element in the show giving it it's unique story that I did not mind one bit. I loved the characters, OP's and story very much making it one of my top 10 favorite anime  and easily one of the best school anime I have ever seen. The pacing was great for a 13 episode series making it easy to watch in one sitting. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a great supernatural anime revolving around a tightly knit group of friends. However, Kokoro Connect is still a school drama at heart (no pun intended) so it may not appeal to everybody. That bring said, if you like shows about high school or want to see a show about great characters, this is the show for you. Though not perfect, Kokoro Connect will always hold a spot near the top of my anime list as well as a spot in my heart.",

            "content": "*Minor Spoilers Ahead*\r\nHello Everyone! Welcome to my 3rd Review, and this time it's on Kokoro Connect. I will be focusing on Kokoro Connect as well as Michi Random, just so you know.\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nThe story follows 5 friends from Yamaboshi Academy, \r\nYaegashi Taichi, Himeko Inaba, Iori Nagase, Kiriyama Yui, and Aoki Yoshifumi. Each of these characters did not have a club that they fit into, so they formed the Student Cultural Society. One day, Aoki and Yui's bodies are swapped, and soon it begins happening to all of them at random times. As this phenomenon continues, they begin to discover each others emotional scars andsecrets, which may end up tearing the SCS and their friendship apart.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nIf anyone likes the art style of K-On!, then Kokoro Connect should be enjoyable to look at. The art styles are almost exactly the same, and give off that 'moe' feeling. I personally enjoyed the animation, although there were no big scenes that really involved large amounts of quality animation. Even with the moe feeling, Kokoro Connect portrays Drama and Sadness in very realistic and good ways.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEach of the voice actors for Kokoro Connect sounded exactly like how their character would. (Especially the best grilllll Himeko Inaba) The soundtrack of Kokoro Connect was quite pleasant to listen too, and I especially liked the first 2 openings and the 3rd ending. The way each character really sounded like they were crying genuine tears was very enticing, and the way Iori's voice changed from her bubbly, idol personality to a monotonous, depressed Iori. Inaban-Sama's voice actor sounded especially like her character, giving off that extreme bossiness and power of the group-kinda feeling.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, the characters are pretty unique in a sense. Each of the characters have their own problems in life and deeper backstory than you think, which shows why the characters act as how they do. During one of the arcs, we got to see how Iori truly felt and the different masks she put on to fit her own 'ideal' self. We got to see that Aoki didn't love Yui just because she looked similar to his older girlfriend, but a genuine love. We got to see Inaban's true self and the way she didn't trust anybody and the mask she put on to prevent others from discovering her true self. And lastly we got to see Taichi, the 'nice generic protagonist' actually was confronted about his 'Selfless Freak' attitude. I liked this because many the nice generic protagonist is in many harem anime, and his harem loves him for the fact he is nice. In Kokoro Connect, however, Taichi is confronted by Himeko many times about his attitude instead of just going with the flow and saying, 'Oh, yeah, this guy is really nice and stuff.' I liked the way Heartseed was shown as the monotonous yet good(in a way). Heartseed showed the crew many lessons, yet none of them seemed to appreciate him. But, as an antagonistic type of character, I guess he isn't supposed to be liked by the gang.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMany parts of Kokoro Connect were outrageous and sometimes you just wanted to leap through your screen and give the characters a good beating. Although in the end, the conflicts and other things ended the way I wanted it too. Maybe this is a bit biased in my opinion since the ship I wanted to sail didn't look so hot until the end. Each of the supernatural phenomenons were interesting and the way each of them invaded others privacy and leading to bigger and more depressing, real life conflicts were really interesting. It kept me enticed and the episode previews at the end made me thinking, whoa! What's gonna happen next episode? I gotta watch it now!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was one of my favorite anime of all time, and I can't think of many flaws at all(but what is Heartseed anyways???). The way the creators put Supernatural aspects into a School Life/Drama along with moe characters is amazing, and I loved it! The characters are all lovable too, although there are many moments that pissed me off. If anyone is looking for a lighthearted tearjerking drama with supernatural aspects, I would highly suggest Kokoro Connect. \\n\\n\r\n                                                See ya guys all in my next review! :)",

Kokoro connect was one of the anime this season that i thought \"Swapping bodies? that seems like one of those typical harem, with a very crap story\"  I was very wrong.\r\nThe story has many plot twists, that adds an element of Romance with a bit of Dark drama (drama associated with crazy stuff). It plays with your emotions quite a fair bit and gives you the most unexpected outcomepossible. with each Character with its unique and different personality that interwines with each other, this anime shows how they help each other out in time of need and learning to accept each other, it adds appropriate  sound effects at the right situations creating emotional, or comedy scenes but to be honest most anime now a days those that. The art reminded me quite a bit of Hyouka, detailed backgrounds and etc. \\n\\n\r\nOverall just after watching it for 5 episodes i think that this is one of the best anime this season, it gives enjoyment to the viewers who like slice of life dramas that can get you emotional while adding a hint of romance that plays with your emotions more. It is definitely an anime that is worth watching especially if you are planning to have your emotions played with.",

            "content": "Hm, where to start? At the beginning the show kinda just throws you into what is happening to these people. There is no set up to learn and appreciate the \"normal\" state of these characters before they are forced into the mess of their situation. It's a common approach for stories with similar tropes. You wake up and your life is fucked up. The story then proceeds to combine deep analysis of internal trauma, pretending to be other people and masturbation. Surprisingly, that's not how it goes in Kokoro connect. Instead the scene is set with the knowledge that something has happened and more importantly,this is the character set. And there I think is where the show differentiates itself from other media that has used the trope. Switching bodies is an extremely personal experience, something that most spend a great deal of time analyzing or at least addressing. Kokoro connect almost brushes it to the side and only uses it to guide the story. Instead of the trope infecting the characters being the story, the trope guiding the characters to infect each other is. It illuminates what the events say about the characters as a group and about the characters as individuals while pushing particular aspects of their personal qualities into the shadows. And so the phenomena forced upon by heart seed aren't really the point. I read somebody describing the show as Deus ex Machina: the Show. In the way that I'm taking about, it almost is. The phenomena are only present to give a bit of life. So, a secondary effect is that the transition between phenomena doesn't really matter, any one of them could facilitate the exact same character development and the story doesn't form arcs as well as many people think.\\n\\n\r\nSo, back to the beginning. There's problems, there's characters. And holy fuck is it hard to get the character at first. They're all generic anime characters and have anime names. The content of what makes a person might be connected wholly to the body but holy fuck does that make it hard to understand who is who. I honestly watched it with the character list open the first several episodes. The first goal of the show is to get Taichi to solve everybody's problems, set up a harem and make people have character in one episode bursts of exposing past trauma. Not really, but that's the line that it danced against and almost shifted into for a lot of people. The show manages to do it kinda well, not winning any awards for the execution but reasonably good. Taichi remains a bit of a selfless nobody protag while Yui and other guy lack quite a bit of identity outside of the primary love triangle. However, the facet of the characters that shines is in how they interact with each other. I can't articulate why this was done well or bad or anything as well as I can other aspects, which is unfortunate because this is what made the show good. Many times throughout the series laughs were coaxed out of me and once or twice I struggled to keep myself from hysterics. Other times, particularly and mostly at an episode centred upon Nagase, I was close to tears. That whole episode was just flawlessly executed and when the final theme ends and the previews for the next episode are done, you're shaken and emotionally confused about what you just watch. My motions were in a highly tightened state and it was one of those moments you  go, \"Fuuuck.\"  and laugh and cry a bit. And any anime that can make me elicit tears or laughter when I'm sitting alone watching it on my laptop with headphones on gets big kudos from me. \\n\\n\r\nThese people felt real, or at least more real than for most anime. These people were fun and easy to care about, or at least more so than for most anime. The finale may have been lacklustre and Michi Random may have been all kinds of shit (relative to the main series, it could stand alone as decent, however my thoughts with regards to this are the same ones everybody has so no point in going into that). This review may be overly positive due to the possibly mediocre brilliance of the show paired with its highly enjoyable nature. I may have forgotten a place to comment about how the music is an appropriate and effective asset in its context, doing wonders for the mood. I enjoyed the thing. Two thumbs up and a well deserved pat on the back for Kokoro Connect.",

            "content": "This review contains some spoilers.\r\nI picked this up thinking it comes with the warm-and-fuzzy, slice of life package like AnoHana (AnoHana has lots of problems but I really dig the world it's set in and how it's presented to us), coupled with enough emotional drama like Kimi no na wa, but nope. Didn't happen.\r\n-----------------------------\r\nStory - 3\r\nKokoro Connect has a solid premise\u2014that's partly what drew me to it in the first place. The main issue is that it didn't quite meet my expectations, because although it touches upon deeper topics specific to the experiences of older teens (the light novel is categorized as seinen, which Isuppose is fair), it nonetheless does so in a sorta halfhearted manner. Although the meat of the plot stems from a supernatural element, it's clear that the creator was attempting to use this supernatural quality as a way to explore \"realistic struggles.\" But unfortunately, these attempts fell flat. \\n\\n\r\nListen, realism isn't constructed through cherrypicking a couple of the \"personal struggles of the youths,\" attaching them to each character, and then info-dumping your way to resolution with the occasional deus ex machina intervention to speed things along (but more on that later because omg, the characters). That's not realistic at all. That doesn't make me feel like I'm watching something real and worthwhile and relatable. In reality (see what I did there?), the story of Kokoro Connect feels like an empty shell of what it could have been. Sure, characters wax philosophy about the self and their love for one another, but it feels like it's coming from a textbook and not from the heart. The storytelling is just, simply put, kinda lazy. Taichi's reasoning for loving wrestling, for instance, is told to us almost like a lesson, as if he's just rattling off facts of Taichi 101, which is hilarious because the piece of information is presented LITERALLY AS EVIDENCE, as a piece of information to affirm Inaba's theory of Taichi's freakish selflessness, rather than as a piece of character subtlety. All the \"secrets\" of each character are just straight-forwardly revealed in a \"Fine, I'll tell you my secret\" kind of way\u2014there is no initial intrigue, no poking around needed. Instead it's a boring ask-and-you-shall-receive type of conflict (which isn't really a conflict?) They might as well just give us a Handbook to All the Characters so we can just read about them instead of watching the story unfold.\\n\\n\r\nHeartseed's presence is absolutely nonsensical. He's just a one-dimensional catalyst. It'd be so much cooler if he were some uber mysterious, unapproachable mega-being, but instead he's just...kinda there. Initially he shows up, messes with things for \"fun\" (uh, sure), info-dumps some random bits of information about his abilities and his plans and his thoughts or whatever, then disappears again. Why?? What's the point?? (I mean, thanks for conveniently being there I guess).\\n\\n\r\nI mean I'll give this show props for baffling me in the first few episodes with all the personality switcheroo\u2014that was pretty fun. See? The premise works guys! But the execution is horrible! And amidst all the chaos, that was when the character dynamics really stood out. But then came everything else and I, uh, lost interest really fast.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\\n\r\nThe show's got some cool color schemes and lighting in key moments of emotional drama which I appreciated. Those were the very few moments when I felt some things\u2014mainly just, like, shock or horror at certain instances of the plot, and only in the beginning. The character artwork is distinctive enough for me to remember who's who, which is...good. Too bad Taichi looks like your classic self-insert hero, so eh.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 3\\n\\n\r\nIt's sad because part of the reason AnoHana works is that it has a great OST. Kokoro Connect's soundtrack is pretty nonexistent if not just forgettable. If it had better music, I'm sure I would have felt more things. Music is magical.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 2\\n\\n\r\nOH BOY, HERE WE GO. Where do I begin.\\n\\n\r\nTaichi is a dud. His personality is hardly a personality. At one point Inaba accuses his selfless nature of actually being selfish. Well...yeah. Anything anyone does can be taken as a form of selfishness, this is not an original piece of information, okay. Taichi, you idiot. His very presence makes me think that this is a borderline harem anime, which kinda takes away the realism it seems to be going for, and inserts an unbelievable amount of silly optimism into the conflicts as a form of feel-good (but lazy) resolution. And this show is supposed to be seinen.\\n\\n\r\nInaba seems to be the only level-headed character here, the only one I even remotely cared about, but even then, SOMEHOW, she becomes reduced to a simple personality \"type.\" Dude, she had so much potential, and it was all ruined. I guess this kind of oversimplification and making characters flat and recognizable by one trait is the best way to keep the characters organized as their personalities jump around, but still. Plus, her personal philosophy about her personality is sort of hard to believe and doesn't really make any sense. At one point, she talks about how she was born distrusting others, as if there is a gene that causes you to be distrustful or something, but what? Trust is a social trait, it's born from social interaction and observation, created after birth, not during it or because of it or whatever. It should vary accordingly as you age and meet new people and spend time with the people around you\u2014family, friends, strangers. It's hard to believe that Inaba hasn't changed at all since birth, just as it's hard to believe that Iori seems to cling onto the idea that her initial personality at birth (or as a child) is her \"true\" personality. That also literally makes no sense. This show might single-handedly kill the nature v. nurture debate.\\n\\n\r\nYui's issue was really interesting at first, but it got resolved WAY too fast. Like WAY TOO FAST. It's a serious trauma\u2014it should not be even remotely resolved in the form of a few kind words and sketchy promises from Taichi, ESPECIALLY when said words are spoken and said promises are made in the middle of the night in an empty park (apparently Yui's trauma isn't traumatic enough for her to be triggered by such a setting, which I find hard to believe) with a man, no less. It's just much too unbelievable, and I was left thinking that the creator didn't understand, at all, how to write characters who are emotionally and psychologically damaged. Yui is the result of a halfhearted attempt at constructing a (SPOILER) victim of sexual assault, as in that her actions and shifts in emotion are not believable at all.\\n\\n\r\nAoki is just kind of there and ultimately forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3\\n\\n\r\nBy episode 5, I was basically done and ready to move on. This was a major wtf moment for me. The characters were way too chill during a moment of extreme crisis; Heartseed had revealed to possess an extremely disturbing motive, and everyone just kind of rolls with it? Okay? Yes, tears are shed, but it's portrayed in an almost blas\u00e9 way, as if the characters are just miming the actions but not really living through them. To be honest, that basically sums up the entire show. Like I said before, there is no heart. Regurgitation of bits of philosophy will not make me feel things. I can get that at school.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3\\n\\n\r\nI think I know what the anime is trying to be, maybe, but its execution leaves something to be desired. It sort of becomes a hot mess of random moods and genres, oscillating drastically between a lighthearted slice-of-life/romance/comedy harem and supernatural drama in a way that gave me whiplash. Basically, it has an identity crisis of its own (if this is in fact intentional it would be ironic and admittedly ingenious). There are actually some serious moments that can't be taken seriously at all, moments that I actually found to be low-key hilarious, even though I'm pretty sure this isn't supposed to be a dark comedy, so... The show gets some points for its art and the excellent voice acting especially during the personality switches. But not enough. My recs: Go watch Clannad or Nana or Toradora.",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect is among my favorite anime of all time.  Essentially a slice of life with a supernatural twist, it does not appeal to the audience via action, adventure, or fantastic visuals.  Rather, it is an exploration of the human condition.  It deconstructs what humans consider their personal identity by exposing gender roles, emotions, and even innermost thoughts.  Although it is saddled by some melodrama and several of the main characters have less than appealing personalities, Kokoro Connect appeals to me with its bravery and willingness to tackle uncomfortable issues.\r\nBy now you should know the plot: a group of five studentsjoin the \"cultural research club\" for various reasons, basically because they are all slightly unusual in some way.  Perhaps these idiosyncrasies make them interesting, because some alien entities then come and spawn supernatural phenomena to mess with them in the hopes of generating interesting behavior.  For example, the first phenomenon has these high school students switching bodies, allowing them a peek into what life might be like for their friends.  This includes exploration of what it means to be a girl versus a boy.  It's entertaining at first and then takes a more dramatic turn as the characters begin to feel increasing stress as the different phenomena hit them.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes up a person?  Is it how they behave?  What they think?  What they feel?  Are we only defined by our relationships with (and to) others?  This anime is willing to explore these issues in depth and even has the courage to take an optimistic stab at answering some of its own questions.  Often in a \"what-if\" anime like this the show poses the questions but makes no strong claims, allowing the viewer to decide what they believe.  Here, the show actually attempts to dispense advice on how one should live life.  I generally found it to be decent advice, or at the very least innocuous.  \\n\\n\r\nThis degree of daring would be enough to earn an above average score, but what puts this Kokoro Connect over the top is that the best girl wins in the romance department.  I'm already a sucker for love triangles in anime, but what frustrates me is that usually the best girl does NOT win.   Not so with Kokoro Connect; instead of the girl and boy getting together merely in service of the plot (Toradora, I'm looking at you), mutual admiration that just makes sense prevails.  Even better, this best girl in THIS anime is easily the most interesting and lovable character in my opinion, showing vulnerability but also courage and inner strength.  She is willing to see her own flaws and try to improve.  The show doesn't make her superhuman either; at one point she too is depressed by the mirror held up for her to see the warts on her personality, but ultimately doesn't let it defeat her.  While it's true I didn't love the main male character she falls for (he's a bit wimpy to be honest), she is tied with Kirusu from Stein's Gate for the title of Best Anime Girl.  \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't hurt that there is a scene later in the series where she is reverted to her childhood self, and the way she is drawn as a little kid is SO ADORABLE that it may induce cardiac arrest in the faint of heart.  Watch at your own peril.\\n\\n\r\nNote: I did not write a separate review for Michi Random because I consider that simply to be the final four episodes of the series rather than a separate sequel.",

            "content": "None of you might know that I had written a review for this show before since I was a rookie to anime and MAL in general (Don't worry, the old review is at the end of this :P). In fact, Kokoro Connect was my 18th anime and my first review, much like every other person's first review it was embarrassing. I 10/10ed everything and called it the best anime of all time. Clearly I fanboyed at this show. Then, more than a year and a half later, I reminisced the love I had for this show since then and much like Aoki, wanted to findout how much I still love it or if I even do anymore for that matter. Then? I rewatched it. Result? Not a 10/10 but a brilliant show I know I'll treasure forever for it's influence in my early anime days and the psychological theme it gave.\\n\\n\r\nKokoro Connect, much like it's name is all about the hearts of friends connecting, I'm surprised it isn't called Tomodachi Connect, but egging on trivial matters won't get us anywhere. The reason I loved this show so much before and still do is because it has a psychological theme. It makes you think about your interactions with friends. Would you reveal your darkest secrets to friends? Would you confess to a friend you now love? Kokoro Connect explores such themes, but it's not just the everyday themes it explores, in the case of Kiriyama, it explored her dark past in particular one incident and it's focus on that in an arc left my hair on end. I won't spoil it but it's definitely worth the wait. Kokoro Connect has a lot of drama as well, how fights go out between friends all with just a few secrets revealed and honestly it's quite relatable. We all had fights with our friends for one reason or another (if you don't have friends, this always happens, also, go find friends :P). Now I found the slice of life tag quite confusing especially since Kokoro Connect focuses on a particular plot, Balloon Vine. Things don't repeat and although the daily life isn't exactly like a SoL I can kinda understand why it was kept so. Another important part of the anime was the romance, although not impactful or even deeply explored, it made it's mark. Those expecting romance can find it in plenty in the Kokoro Connect Michi Random special since it's romance oriented. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of focus, unfortunately the soundtrack isn't something that received it. The OPs and EDs felt bland and I only found the third ED enjoyable. Meanwhile the OST as well felt mediocre, I didn't find it amazing, but I did like a few jingles here and there that played while the VAs did a great job. I found Inaba (Sawashiro Miyuki) quite unbelievable in her acting in various places especially the crying scenes but that shouldn't be surprising as only a handful of recognisable roles were on the main cast's resumes. In spite of that, they did a good job with their representation. On the topic of representation we also have the artstyle, it felt okay. I liked it because the characters looked much cuter than with a generic style. Although the artstyle of the main anime was great, I found some parts (especially the first OP) strange. Not bad, but strange, I guess it was because I was expecting something generic or so. But the artstyle was slightly different and Silver Link got an overall positive for that. Now the issue here is the plot holes that riddled the anime. The biggest of which is Balloon Vine's purpose. His reasons for messing with the kids weren't given at all. And at many times a few of the supernatural elements happened at convenient times, especially that one bit in the last arc.\\n\\n\r\nAn interesting bit was the existence of the Special. I haven't seen a special in a long time where it directly tied to the main story in a plot point as Specials and OVAs are usually extra episodes meant to entertain us after the main plot and series is over but that wasn't the case here. Nevertheless it was still enjoyable. It's unique set of characters all made me feel like that. At first I felt Inaba was quite irritating and I questioned my 2016 self for marking her as one of my favorite characters in MAL but the later episodes reminded me why I did so, she went better. Iori, Yui and Aoki all developed amazingly especially because each had a specific arc focusing on them and I didn't find any of them bad. But one character was missing from here. Taichi. To my knowledge, in this 13 episode series he didn't develop at all... The other four got their time to shine in these episodes so I suppose they focused on Taichi in the Michi Random special along with Inaba who also didn't exactly get much focus in this series either. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end. After rewatching Kokoro Connect I was reminded of the fun I had watching it and of the impact it left on me. It along with anime like ToraDora, Golden Time and Kaichou wa Maid Sama, influenced me to watch much more romance, which soon developed into a RomCom addiction and so far still exists, although my focus has shifted to pure Comedy I still have the love I had with Romance and watching this reinstilled those feelings within me. Kokoro Connect is not your everyday RomCom because it doesn't focus on either. Romance was only a third focus while Comedy was rare. The true focus of the anime was the bond between friends. Their experiences, their hardships, how they overcome them together and how supernatural elements push them even harder. That's Kokoro Connect.\\n\\n\r\nP.S: In case you're willing to read a cringey fanboyish review here's my old review. Please remember that was my first ever review so I didn't want it to go at a loss XD\\n\\n\r\nOriginal Review (Oct 15, 2016)\\n\r\nPerfect. In every sense of the word. No anime ever made me so satisfied ever before. Out of all the RomComs I've watched, Kokoro Connect's ending left me satisfied the most. Such a satisfying and perfect anime is indeed rare to find these days. The story, art and character all are perfectly balanced, which is always obviously difficult. I enjoyed the story (though it got me confused once or twice), while the art style is really beautiful in simple words. Especially Taichi, Inaban and Yui. All three were the best looking out of the rest of the group. While for the character, the characters are\u00a0perfectly relatable as many situations in the anime reflected on common real life problems (I wanna give examples but can't spoil it for those who haven't watched it yet). This anime totally has the potential to stand with RomCom classics such as Clannad,Shigatsu wa kimi no uso, Golden Time and ToraDora!. I really hope there is a second season (Fingers crossed)!",

            "content": "When I decided to watch this anime I had a mentality set to drop it when certain conditions were met. In other words, if flags that I'd set would go off then I'd drop this show. I mean, how great can a show be with a plot like this? I felt the need to at least try it though.\r\nOh how silly I was before I watched this... how dumb of me to think poorly of it so soon.\r\nNo spoilers, understanding that you know the concept of the show and assuming you'll watch the rest of the ending (Michi Random). Of course it being another 4episodes, Ill just review the entire series here.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\n5 special teens are introduced to an experiment that involves switching bodies, what a plot. Don't shake this off just yet though, as I almost did, because it gets extraordinarily better. The experiment is \"watched/controlled\" by a third party the whole time and wants to see where these kids end up. While you buckle up and follow this journey through, you'll learn about the crew and feel as if your there watching it progress. The story seems \"easily overdone\" but its far from it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is totally on par with what I consider pretty. We all have our own preferences and that's when makes us unique, regardless this show is very nice to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nNothing wrong with the music really. You'll pick up on it in certain situations but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThis is the story's ingredient that adds the most flavor. I've only seen a few shows, barely, that have a great chemistry between characters. This anime exceeds my expectations and goes beyond. I found myself so excited to learn about each character and when a secret was revealed. You can't help but want to cry in some cases or be overwhelmingly happy. I couldn't believe that everything went together like a symphony as it did. Very well done.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThis was more than enjoyable to me. The independent fact that I was considering it a bad show from the start is terrible of me and I apologize. This was something I wouldn't mind to watch all day everyday. The good vibes and roller coaster of emotions are just amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nIn conclusion, watch it. No but really though, this is something else. This is, like I said, assuming you finish the series with the last 4 (separate?) episodes. I yearn for more animes to follow these foot steps of character development as portrayed in this show. It was done carefully and leaves you with an incredible feeling. Highly recommend this. Thanks for reading.",

            "content": "Slightly less longer Review:\r\nNow it has been many months since I have watched this show, and I have forgotten a lot, but the reasons that had stuck with me to watch this show are its in depth characters and their amusing interactions (mixed in with some wacky and cool supernatural things), its romance twists and turns, its comedy, its deepness and complexity with regards to how humans think and act, and its uniqueness and creativity (supernatural occurrences). So basically it's a supernatural romance comedy, HA, what could possibly go wrong?\r\nThe \"what could possibly go wrong\" section. It has plot holes, it was no clear objectivein its story, it's an arc anime (an animes based off arcs rather than episodic or one objective. This could either be a positive or a negative to some), the romance CAN feel random to some people, its generic characters (but later on in the show you realize they're not JUST generic!! So that's a bonus...),  and its \"friendship is power!!\" moments. But again, later on in this show they give you a new outlook on things that make it enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNot so slightly less longer review, aka, long review:\\n\\n\\n\r\nRelooking on this anime after a while now, I don't think it was as great as I had first impersonated it to be. There were a few things that just didn't feel right to me now that I thin back on it.\\n\\n\r\nOne of those things is its plot holes, oh my lordy.... if you watch this anime, trust me, all your \"okay hopefully they'll explain this at the end of the story\" will not come true. I repeat, this will NOT come true, this is a fair warning before diving into this show.\\n\\n\r\nIt also doesn't really have a story, if that makes sense. It doesn't have a clear objective, I guess is what I mean to say. The story is more about how these 5 people are together and their crazy random moments that happen to them. Which is honestly, what makes this show so enjoyable to watch. Because although there are a few things wrong with this show, you can still enjoy those nice moments. \\n\\n\r\nI felt as I was watching this show that it had a very nice depth on its characters, although some characters were generic (the overly nice guy that could almost never do harm? Come on...)  but you get to know more about them, if that makes sense. You realize that there's something more to these characters than what they're showing you and it's nice to see that. Throughout their fun and unique reactions to the new supernatural things happening to all of them you get to see those nice little tidbits that are cool to see. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance in this show is also not bad, not bad at all, it was again, enjoyable to watch and you will see a cool little twist every now and then. And I mean like, ToraDora level twists where the MC's love interest isn't exactly cut and paste clear. Although as I look back on the show it does somewhat feel like to me \"okay.... um... so... what exactly made her/him like her/him?\" But nonetheless it was still enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere were also some very deep and not commonly talked about topics of how people are that was portrayed in this show that gave this anime for me a major bonus. I speak on a personal level: one of the characters felt lost in the sense that she felt like she didn't know who she was because she's been faking her persona for so long. Those are very subtle things that not a lot of people, let alone shows care to portray. This show sort of scratches the surface on those subtle emotions which is always something you can appreciate. You also feel like there's a reason people are doing the things they are doing. It's harder to explain without giving away spoilers, so I'll just hope you watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nOh God, It's 12:53 AM and without even skimming this over to edit it I can already tell I regurgitated a lot of what I already said, hope you enjoyed reading this and end up watching the show!!",

            "content": "*Note: This is based of the currently aired 13 episodes, and not the final 4 to be released next March; I will review them separately upon release*\r\nI decided to write a review for Kokoro Connect as many friends of mine have differing opinions about the show so I wanted to express mine in order to give as much emphasis about the enjoyment I got out of this anime.\r\nKokoro Connect was a bit of oddity at first, initially I found it to be quite a typical high-school club anime, and as much as I love them, I was a bit bored at first but the storyquickly took a drastic turn as the first phenomenon occurred; Kokoro Connect will often make you feel very comfortable with the way the storyline is progressing before shoving an unexpected plot-twist at your face to confuse you as much as possible.\\n\\n\r\nAs bad as that sounds, it was this feature of the anime that kept me hooked from start to finish, and as I say that, I shall move on to the rating breakdown;\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs said previously, Kokoro Connect has a knack of throwing incredible plot-twists at unexpected moments and this massively affected the anticipation I had for every coming moment of every episode; Kokoro Connect is the very definition of apprehension. The three main storyline arcs had their ups and downs, but always made up for it in the final parts of their respective sections. Despite this fact, there was a period of time between about episodes 7-10 that were INCREDIBLY slow moving and effectively reversed the anticipation formula of which I mentioned earlier. Once Episode 11 hit though, the storyline picked up massively until the end of Episode 13 in which the show left us on a large cliffhanger for the upcoming 4 episodes that will be released next year.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nA hit or miss, the art of Kokoro Connect could be considered a slightly underrated style of animation. If there's anything I hate more in an anime, it's when all the characters look the same, but fortunately similar to K-on!, this anime has very lush animation and tries to create a high level of difference in the facial expressions, clothing and just mainly the character design in general. The scenery is also created with a high level of detail and the openings and endings are just beautiful, notably \"Cry Out\" which is the second ending of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting of Kokoro Connect is provided by well know seiyuus such as Miyuki Sawashiro and Takahiro Mizushima, and some people might find this a bad thing, especially if they've watched many anime with these VAs. But despite this, all the voice actors in Kokoro Connect provide a smooth, detailed, emotive and most importantly realistic degree of voicing. All their voices suit the characters well and I couldn't have asked for better ones. The music in Kokoro Connect, oh man, is it good. You'll be recognising the main tune by about episode 4 in a wide variety of remixes, themes and arranges. Scenes are perfectly fine tuned with the addition of these amazing tracks and I hope the series continues with this great standard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Kokoro Connect are both stereotypical and unique in their own ways. Taichi is the standard selfless teenage male who gets all the girls and is completely unaware of it until told so. But despite this fact, he does provide his own character and still maintains a high degree of individuality. Without revealing too much, I can say that, unlike most selfless characters, Taichi gives a reason for his character and this solely is the reason that I think he is so likeable.\\n\\n\r\nAnother notable character would be Nagase. Nagase is very hard to describe in this review due to most of her personality is heavily influenced by her past and describing it would be a large spoiler, but it is evident that she has a very undefinable personality and her tone and character is heavily effected through the course of the anime's story and you would have to watch it to understand her reactions and personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe three remaining characters of the club are Himeko, Aoki and Yui. While all unique, these characters still have a high degree of development that are yet to be described, and having read all translated chapters of the light novels I can tell you that they will be fleshed out in the future.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nKokoro Connect was an anime that I was slightly reluctant to jump into giving all the views that my close friends had on it but now I can say that I will never regret my decision to watch such a fantastic anime. The only main reasons I did not give this a 10/10 enjoyment rating was because I felt that about three quarters through the anime the storyline paced very slow, giving me weeks of anticipation for the moment that the storyline would finally pick up. The other main reason is that I felt very incomplete finishing this anime and the storyline was left at a very emotional point and that, in turn made me feel like this anime didn't give me the final impression I expected it to give; this is probably because we're yet to see the final 4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nKokoro Connect was a great experience, and I look forward to the final episodes with glee.\\n\\n\r\n*This was my first review so if you have any comments about the quality of it or how I can improve please message me :)*\\n\\n\r\nStar~\\n\\n",

            "content": "**This review includes \"Kokoro Connect: Michi Random\" (last four episodes)**\r\nKokoro connect is a very refreshing take on your typical RomCom story that is very unique to itself. I consider myself pretty well versed when it comes to the romance genre, so when I say this is one of my favorites I want to stress how significant that is. I wouldn't consider this to be a \"cutesy\" series, that gives you a warm fuzzy feeling of budding love and anticipation of the coming confession. Minus the supernatural aspect, the interpersonal realtionships are very realistic, which I love.\r\nStory 9/10 - I know a perfect score for thestory seems a bit over-kill and you probably thing I'm being biased because I like this series so much. However, Kokoro Connect is able to tie in so many thought provoking concepts and ideas while still keeping the audiences attention. One of the best aspects of this story is how funny it is, I loved how one minute you feel like you could cry and the next you were laughing your head off. The only real issue I have with the story is the last arc, and not because I don't think it is good, but I feel that it should have been earlier in the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10 - Nothing special here, very traditionally animated (which I enjoy since I'm \"old school\"). Colors were good, don't remember any eye-popping computer generated animation off the top of my head. I don't think this will by any means impress anyone from an art persective, but it fulfills its purpose by having good color and distiguishable lines.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10 - Just like the art, no notable OST music or score. Voice acting was very good, characters were engaging and not monotone. I watched the subbed version obviously, but I saw that the dub will be released soon so I would love to hear the dubbed acting. Overall the sound didn't distract from the story, so I give it a \"good\" 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10 - I was very tempted to put 10/10 on the characters, because they are what makes this series. I liked how the male characters were very realistic, and not the typical oblivious and unrealisticly nice guys. Taichi in particular, because he is the quote \"good guy\" in the series but his personal faults and short comings make him a relatable character. The girls are also very well developed characters. Iori is probably my least favorite character, not because of her contribution to the story, but because I don't feel she developed much for how much time was spent on her. Like most fan boys, Inaba is one of my favorite female characters of all time. He balance of intellect/tsundere mixed with flirty/funny is very rare and works well for her role in the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 - Like I said earlier, this is one of my favorite series. I laughed, I (almost) cried, and felt like I was there with the characters as they developed and progressed through the story. I know that Kokoro Connect is such a diverse series, incorportating romance/drama/humor/science fiction(?) all in one, and this might turn people away. But, if I had to keep only five animes and never watch any others again, this would easily be one of those five.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 - Anyone who likes RomComs or enjoys a good laugh, would be the first people I would suggest this to. But honestly I wish that everyone would at least give it a chance, and who knows? You may fall in love with it too.",

It is something more than average, newer style, but still too poor.\r\n*Characters were strange, because idiots is bad word. In first episodes I just couldn't accept those heroes, so there is another minus. There was another thing, which was spoiled - inside problems of onecharacter shouldn't be problem of whole 5 characters. These problems were taking time for months if it would be good with that awesome chronological system of fable.\\n\r\n*Music was probably the best of that anime, that piano was many times very good.\\n\r\nSupernatural ideas were good too, but it was too small amount of them!\\n\\n\r\nI wonder how that anime would look like, if it would be created in shoujo art theme.",

            "content": "***Minor Spoliers***\r\n***Includes episodes 14-17 (Michi Random)***\r\nUsually, i don't really enjoy light novel adaptions because of how butchered they become or because they don't adapt the whole story. Out of the few i do enjoy, this one probably ranks second to Suzumiya Haruhi. In fact, they are pretty alike if you try to spot similarities. \r\nThe storyline is quite addictive. Basically, a person named heartseed (or Balloon Vine, depending the group that subbed it) creates a phenomenon every arc to place our main characters into a troublesome situation. Usually, the phenomenon reminds the mains of their traumas or problems they currently face. This drives the characterdevelopment. I do feel some parts of the story is rushed and the first arc is probably the most interesting arc but that's mainly because you're not used to the characters. The created a sense of originality so it becomes more interesting. After that, most of the problems and dilemmas are pretty predictable because the problems that was avoided in the previous arc start to resurface.\\n\\n\r\nThe art really reminded me of K-On! That's not bad though. Its the first time I've experienced an anime animated like this. There's nothing really special going on in this department. Just solid animation all around.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the soundtrack of this anime. Especially the ED of the first 5 episodes. I feel like the ED playing with the preview of the next episode made it preview really dramatic and badass lol. The voice actors were all very good and the voices matched the characters perfectly. I hate it when I see a character and they sound totally different from what they look like they would sound. Its weird but that point really bugs me personally.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was... interesting. I feel like the author really tried to make this as realistic as possible. Realistically, our traumas and things of that kind can't really all be cured at once. It's a slow process and you gradually overcome some of the things that affected you in the past. I feel like by trying to do that, it affected the quality of the anime. Sometimes, a character be so hung up on a problem for so many episodes that it becomes annoying (I'm looking at you, Iori). Sometimes, the problems that you thought was solved in the last arc come back and it leaves you thinking \"wait, we already went over this... stfu\". The internal struggles of the characters just gets old after 10 episodes of it.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, Kokoro Connect is still very enjoyable. I found myself marathoning the whole thing. It was addicting and it makes me wish they'd make a season 2.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect, a anime that shows you that even MALs' rating system can be flawed. \r\nI just want to start by saying that this is my second Slice of Life anime behind ReLife so I had high expectations going in combined with the 8/10 rating that MAL gave it. \r\nStory - 5/10\r\nThis premise itself isn't half bad, a group of teamagers start a club then one day notice that their \"souls\" are swapping bodies. Then are approached by one of their teachers who is actually possessed by a spirit (they never explain exactly what it is) to be told that this phenomenon is his doingand that it's all for the spirits entertainment. \\n\r\nPretty cool right? Not really. This specific phenomenon only last for about 4 or 5 episodes, after that the spirit starts to change what happens (I.e. Emotional transmission, acting on your deepest desires etc). Which was a real let down because they could have used this \"soul swapping\" to bring out so much more of the characters personalities, feelings, and hardships.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6/10\\n\r\nI've seen better but not that bad. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nI don't really pay that much attention to the music during the show but I can tell you that it fits. As for the intro/outro, they sucked. Didn't like OP 1 or 2 a single bit. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter -  3/10\\n\r\nThe worst part of the whole series to me. \\n\r\nYoshifumi - He had no development or backstory but is considered a main character? The class rep had more or a backstory than he did and she was a supporting character! Laughable. \\n\r\nHimeko - My favorite character in the series, or at least until she degraded herself so much that I couldn't even stand it. My biggest gripe with her is that she was all good as the loner/smart type then they just made her into another part of the haram. Sad\\n\r\nYui - Hasn't the sexual assault / crippling depression backstory been used enough? She gets over her trauma yes, but, after that she just stops developing and it happened so early in the story. Lame\\n\r\nIori - Her story actually wasn't half bad (in the beginning) which is why \"Character\" has a 3 instead of a 1. She has this nice split persona thing going on that I liked. Her development throughout the story was alright but the melodrama with her was unbearable.\\n\r\nTaichi - The White Knight wannabe. This guy sucks in every aspect of the word. He is selfish, oblivious, boring, cowardly, I could go on and on but I think you get it. This guy has the most screen time out of the group yet he has absolutely NO background or character development. I can't even tell you one thing interesting about him. He SUCKS\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I'd rather accept invitations to play facebook games\\n\\n\r\nOverall I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Go watch Toradora or Clannad. \\n\\n",

I'm officially dropping  this show, the first in a while as it is extremely hard to watch therefore my review is probably quite bias. \r\nWell something about the atmosphere of the show made me real unsettled when ever I watched and I felt genuinely extremely uncomfortable and had the desire to turn it off starting somewhere after the 3rd episode. I would compare the feeling to dread and anxiety which culminated into a pretty bad experience. It's not the fault ofthe show more my own, who knows they might of been going for that type of experience though due to it I have now dropped the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf I was to recommend this show to someone I would say its quite similar to Rascal does not dream of bunny girl senpai though quite a bit darker so if that's your taste I'd recommend it. \\n\\n\r\nWell Overall I gave the show a 6 mainly due to that my enjoyment was a 4/10 due to the reasons stated above.

            "content": "For a story that deals with supernatural phenomena from the beginning, to drop the ball with verisimilitude is strange - but Kokoro Connect does just that. This is because, as one character remarks, the supernatural are simply a catalyst for their own conflicts: Kokoro Connect isn't really about the supernatural as much as it is the characters who are victims of it. Keeping these characters' actions grounded in reality is always important in any such narrative, especially within the context of the supernatural.\r\nWhile a couple of the Student Cultural Society members have well written growth and touching conclusions accelerated by the events they endure, othersstruggle to scrape together enough personality to even have a conflict. The main character in particular, Taichi, is yet another one-dimensional protagonist whose only two traits are \"desperately wants to help people\" and \"oblivious to his good looks,\" aside from repeated mentions that he loves professional wrestling. He manages to make the fairly bland characters of Aoki and Inaba seem interesting when interacting with them, but a straight man (stock character, not sexuality) protagonist usually becomes a grind to watch, and Taichi is no exception. While Yui and Iori have interesting arcs, as the latter's becomes the forefront the writer keeps their cards unnecessarily close to the chest for what they're really holding. One wonders anxiously how she will confront the trauma of her childhood, only to be let down by the bizarre notion that her mother re-invited an abusive ex-partner back into the household because she had a vague idea that Iori might benefit from reliving the experience. Even among body-swapping and age-reversing, the absurdity of this development is jarring. \\n\\n\r\nKokoro Connect is inconsistent with its tone, which occasionally works in its favour. Up until the fifth episode, the problems brought about by the body-swapping have been trivial and usually comedic. The drastic change in tone as the club are forced to make a difficult choice and say their farewells to their friend makes one wonder if the previous episodes had been a false pretence. The show is so enjoyable when it is lighthearted that it makes the splintering of the group during the \"unhinged desires\" arc a very heavy watch - the contrast between the loveable antics of the club and the cold distancing they resort to later on is masterfully done. Unfortunately, much like the decision at the hospital, this doesn't end up amounting to much at all. In fact, the conclusion is simply the setting up of a love triangle for the protagonist with the personality of a boiled potato to react to in true boiled potato fashion.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals of Kokoro Connect are what initially drew me to it, in an effort to fill the KyoAni void. This remains a strength throughout the show, with the main cast of characters fitting my own personal preference for realistic design choices (no red eyes and pink hair, sorry Love Live!) and some beautifully drawn settings.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kokoro Connect does a lot of things well, but misses the mark whenever it really matters, which is a more frequent occurrence as the show goes on. The concept of the supernatural acting as a stimulant for adolescent conflicts only really works if the conflicts are complicated or interesting on their own, otherwise you just end up riding the premise hoping it's enough to rise above mediocrity. In this case, it's not.",

            "content": "Introduction:\r\nIf I could express how much I loved this anime, we would need a word which held more enjoyment value than masterpiece. I must say this show had me unsure about the ending throughout the entire show. Not only does this show have great voice acting but an amazing story which will drive you through one emotional trip. If you enjoy or seek romance anime like myself I must say this is a must watch. Drop whatever you're watching and watch this anime. Now I might be exaggerating this anime moderately however, I'm expressing my view from watching quite a few romance anime and thisis definitely the best or tied for it. Now I must admit the anime takes a couple episodes to really hook you in good however, I can say once you've reached that point, it's just so good. You become so attached to the characters and what they're feeling. Also, this is one of those animes where you're either on one side or the other for who you think they should be with.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story to this amazing anime is we have a group of friends who are all apart of this club (they're the only members) and the only reason they've joined is because they don't fit into any other club. Then all of a sudden strange things start happening for example, they start switching bodies which creates mass confusion and alert.\\n\\n\r\nTo avoid any big spoilers these strange incidents keep happening in different forms however, with every new incident the group faces new social problems within their group. Weather it be romance problems, past problems or just emotional problems they're all in the same area but feel very different from each other. The show doesn't have a direct goal but rather just living through the series of incidents. Very early in the show you learn who and why these events are happening but thats not what the show is going for. Instead how each character is affected by the events.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters;\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough the show does have the typical anime roles however, I felt they frequently changed throughout the anime which I've seen in very few. To elaborate, when I mean change, I literally mean characters personality will completely change or will see a significant change. Personally, I felt that was done very well and very good explanations support their flip. In addition, there wasn't any episodes dedicated to one character's development. In fact, what I've noticed with this show is that when something happens, there is depth in their reactions, so rather than making slow/boring episodes dedicated to someones past or whatever. We have an ongoing story rather than taking a break and mass character development. That in fact is one of the key things I enjoyed with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nNotes:\\n\\n\r\n- The artwork is very good for it's time\\n\\n\r\n- There is a sub and a dub for the anime.\\n\\n\r\n- The romance starts coming in more around episode 10 however, there are hints before but the good/real stuff comes in around episode 10\\n\\n\r\n- There are a total of 17 episodes, keep in mind there is Kokoro: Micchi Random too!\\n\\n\r\n- There are five main characters: Three girls & two guys (gender unbalance always creates romance triangles)\\n",

            "content": "What is it that makes an anime a so called \u2018Masterpiece\u2019? That is the question I ask myself whenever I come to the end of any anime. The response I give is kinda tricky because it doesn\u2019t really give a straight answer to such question. I think a masterpiece of an anime is one which simply has no faults, or cons. Therefore, there is nothing which actually makes an anime a masterpiece, but it\u2019s actually the LACK of anything negative which grants it such title. \r\nKokoro Connect is, definitely, a Masterpiece. However, what is really awesome about it is that considering its premises I wouldhave never expected it to become a 10/10 in my list. It has ALL the (apparently) clich\u00e9 aspects of your typical rom-com anime, starting from the five characters: we have Main Character-kun (Taiichi) who is a selfless freak always trying to help everybody and whose way of thinking is basically good, well-seen, positive and stuff; we have Best Friend-kun (Aoki) whose role is basically to act like an idiot and is regularly and violently abused by whoever is close to him; then we have Kawaii-chan (Iori) who is always cheerful and cute and hates to see people sad and youknowtherest; Bitch-chan (Yui, at least at first) who\u2019s being exactly what she is and is one of the abusers of Best-Friend-Kun; and then finally we have the inevitable Tsundere-san (Inaba) who well, is being an apparently cold bitch and then you find out that she actually is one (maybe?).\\n\r\nNow. This is all stuff that you can easily find in any other rom-com anime with this kind of setting. What is it that makes Kokoro Connect better than the rest, though? It is the very LACK of randomness of those characters and, consequently, of the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely NOTHING happens or \u2018exists\u2019 for the sole sake of it. Behind every event, every action AND reaction of every character and behind any of their states of mind and ways to be there are always singular or multiple reasons which precisely explain WHY those things happen or are like that. Do not underestimate this fact, because you RARELY see such dedication to things like that and even MORE RARELY you see it done as greatly as in Kokoro Connect.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also belongs to the Supernatural genre, which basically describes the whole setting of the series. The five characters are subject to strange phenomena throughout the anime, but what actually happens is not as important as how it influences the personal relations of the five. These strange phenomena involve faculties or abilities we maybe dreamed of or wished we have, such as telepathy or body switching; all things which we thought would be cool or entertaining, well\u2026 Kokoro Connect analyses them really well and you\u2019ll notice how wrong, in certain occasions, your expectations have been about having such powers.\\n\\n\r\nI have my own way of rating music (and any other artistic aspect) in an anime: if I do not notice the music while watching, it means that it simply accompanies well the show and I give it an 8/10. If I DO notice it, it can either be because it\u2019s very well done (9/10) or, on the contrary, it\u2019s very poorly written or executed (7/10). Then it can turn into a 10/10 if the music is REALLY awesome or it can be a complete disaster and just level down to a 6/10. \\n\r\nKokoro Connect, in this scale, is a 9/10, both musically-wise and artistically-wise.  Certain scores are particularly interesting and kind of exotic for anime standards, and I simply loved the art.\\n\\n\r\nSo, bottom line, who would I recommend this anime to? \\n\\n\r\nEVERYONE. Everyone who\u2019s interested in watching something BRILLIANTLY DONE. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it because it has some NEVER SEEN ORIGINAL ASPECT or WOW SO MANY FEELS YOU\u2019LL DROWN IN YOUR OWN TEARS, no, I would simply recommend it because I have rarely seen something, after all, very SIMPLE being pulled off THAT nicely.",

That's what connects us \u2014 that we're all broken, all beautifully imperfect.\" \u2014 Emilio Estevez.\r\nRegardless of how well people may think they know you, be it friend or family, it is more likely that there is something you keep or hide from them for whatever reason...but what would occur if, by some series of supernatural phenomena, you were forced to remove the mask you so often don to appear acceptable to society and reveal your true, imperfect self to others?\r\nTo some, this may not appear to besuch a menacing notion, but to others, it may just as well be hell on Earth.\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to \"Kokoro Connect\", a series that revolves around a group of five high school students who must tackle the frightening task of opening up to others and believing in themselves.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nI'll be very straightforward in this review, mostly because without doing so, I wouldn't know exactly what I think about the show. In other words, I have ambivalent feelings, and the act of writing this show is partially for the purpose of sorting them out.\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest merit and fault of the show is that there's too much goodness to explore.\\n\\n\r\nBefore you shred this review to pieces, allow me to explain.\\n\\n\r\nI'll start with the animation and sound, as expressing my thoughts on these is much easier. The animation is decent, but it's nothing to be excited about. The character designs are very similar to those of the \"K-On!\" and \"Tamako Market\" series, mainly because the key animator/original character designer for all three shows were by the same person. There's nothing particularly wrong with this per se, but...no scene ever struck me as amazing. The animation style is definitely not made for complex movement, and this can be seen in certain moments of the show.\\n\\n\r\nYou may argue that a show such as this may not need great animation quality \u2014 certainly, a valid argument. However, similar shows such as \"Hyouka\" (brilliant with day/bright colors) have proven that artwork can drastically add to the ambience of the show, something that the simplistic nature of \"Kokoro Connect\"'s animation fails to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings change every two arcs (a total of 2), while the endings change every arc (a total of 4). I found the majority of them to be very addictive in nature. In addition, they seem to understand and match what the show is about, which is hard to accomplish in music. The openings are light, fluffy pieces that briefly and charmingly show our characters in their every day lives, while the endings are more bittersweet in nature, with a greater emphasis on the electric guitar.\\n\\n\r\nAs good as the openings/endings are, the background music is unfortunately quite weak in comparison. I can't seem to recall any single piece that shook me or greatly amplified the emotion in a scene, although that's a very subjective matter. This was a great pity for me, because a show with drama of this magnitude could have been even better when completed with a great OST.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors (Japanese dubbing) do a good job with their roles, delivering the right emotion in every moment, although it may feel strained from time to time (but not frequently). I particularly applaud them immensely particularly for the first arc, for which the voice acting was superb; you'll see what I mean when you see it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarize, the animation and sound do exactly as they should. There is no major flaw with them, but there's nothing that makes them stand out and grasp the viewer from the screen. With the exception of the great voice acting, the rest are decent at best.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the plot, the concepts for the phenomena are genuinely interesting and unique. The phenomena that occur to the main characters are initially superficial, but get more profound in nature with every arc that passes by; at first, it's as simple as switching bodies, but later progresses to something more frightening, such as acting on impulse or having your thoughts being read by others (at any random moment in time).\\n\\n\r\nNear the beginning, our five main protagonists find their own, interesting/fun ways to cope with the situation at hand, but soon come to realize that this is no laughing matter. Brilliant drama unfolds between characters as these phenomena, once a passing joke, begin to reveal the darker aspects of their personalities and long-hidden pasts.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the shock factor originates from this shift in tone. A once seemingly fascinating concept very suddenly ends up being very destructive towards the characters' friendships and even their own identities. The main characters, unable to tell others of their problem, try their best to \"stick together\" and \"work through it as a team\", even forcibly so, to resolve everything. Unlike some other shows where doing this seems to magically solve everything, \"Kokoro Connect\" satisfyingly shows that confiding in others (or even in oneself) is a very difficult task.\\n\\n\r\nThe writers did a good job by respecting the plot. There were plenty of opportunities for the show to stray into ecchi/fanservice territory, but with good execution avoided doing so and kept this to an honorable minimum.\\n\\n\r\nThat having been said, the characters are definitely the strongest part of the show. In fear of spoiling too much, I'll refrain from sharing too much, but whenever a dire situation strikes our feebly connected group of five, every character faces his/her own set of problems and undergoes a very profound, extensive, yet still comprehensible development. As a result of simultaneous development in different characters, our protagonists constantly change how they interact with one another, whether that be an act of romance or friendship. \\n\\n\r\nIt's very difficult to come across a show that gives such an incredible amount of character development to a main character cast of five people, and even more difficult to find one that develops its interpersonal relationships in such a delicate fashion.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, when there is drama, the show does it just right \u2014 the characters act for motivations that we can understand and evolve in ways that are easily relatable. Additionally, they're not obscenely spelled out for the viewer, as the creators refuse to treat its audience like idiots (and rightfully so). So what's so bad about this? Well...quite a few things.\\n\\n\r\nI previously said that \"there's too much goodness to explore\", and a simpler way of putting it is that the show is paced very awkwardly. In my humble opinion, I believe this to be the case because the creators of the anime adaptation tried to include too many arcs (4 volumes out of 8) into a short time frame (17 episodes).\\n\\n\r\nFor certain other shows, this might have been fine, but it's because each and every arc of \"Kokoro Connect\" is so detailed that even 5 episodes may not be enough to flesh everything out properly. At certain dramatic moments during the show, too many insightful interpersonal relationships and character changes occur concurrently that it may take the casual viewer all his/her effort to merely keep a tab on them. I say this not to sound offend others...I'm merely speaking from experience, as it took me my greatest effort and concentration to notice the nuances in every single development. Simply phrased, there's just too many things going on at once, and all of them are unfortunately too good to leave unnoticed or forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nThis means that the show is incredibly busy and has no brakes. In a story, it's definitely important that characters develop, but after each and every development, it is equally as significant that characters remain static so that the audience fully understand the character's current stances/positions. Only after the viewers have been brought up to speed and after things have settled down can a story progress without confusing its audience, something that \"Kokoro Connect\", in its hectic schedule, cannot regrettably afford to accomplish. Without a good, firm understanding of what our main characters are like, a lot of scenes seem to step into \"melodrama\" territory with characters overreacting (when in truth, they may not be) to certain situations, and certain phrases/actions seem completely out of character (when in truth, again, they may not be).\\n\\n\r\nA lot of things about the plot are also left unexplained, but I won't criticize the show for that, as it does well to provide a lot of closure in its final episode (unlike a lot of other shows) and isn't exactly a completed work. As much as I've discussed the show's flaws, it was nevertheless enjoyable and I definitely hope that the second half of the light novel series gets an anime adaptation as well.\\n\\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: This review includes the 4-episode sequel, \"Kokoro Connect: Michi Random\", as well.\\n\\n\r\n\"We are all wonderful, beautiful wrecks.

As much as I've discussed the show's flaws, it was nevertheless enjoyable and I definitely hope that the second half of the light novel series gets an anime adaptation as well.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (25%) \u2014 8.3/10 & CHARACTERS (25%)  \u2014 8.4/10\\n\\n\r\n\"Kokoro Connect\" contains a variety of phenomena that are all vastly different from one another, each unique and interesting in their own way. The jokes are dealt with in great taste, with the writers giving the characters a fair amount of respect and intelligence. Plot devices, while ridiculous from time to time, are all there for good reason. Each of the five characters are given a tremendous amount of development that is almost fragile, all of which are easily understandable and down to earth. The writers also don't treat the audience like idiots by blatantly stating every observable thing in a scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this is that there are just too many things to concentrate on at any moment in time, all to delicious to miss out on. All characters are constantly being developed without being given a break, almost as if \"Kokoro Connect\" were a train with no brakes. Honestly, the show just needed more episodes to deal with the amount of substance it had \u2014 a full 26 would have been sufficient (much like \"Angel Beats!\") to fix its pacing.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION (10%) \u2014 6.4/10 & SOUND (15%) \u2014 6.8/10\\n\\n\r\nBoth the animation and sound are lackluster. The animation is fluid and the scenes always fit the tone of the moment, but nothing stands out, as is the case with the background music. Nevertheless, the voice acting is well done and the openings/endings were thoroughly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (25%) \u2014 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show was enjoyable, but it would have been a GREATLY more enjoyable if I didn't need to focus so hard on it just to grasp even just the basics of the situation at hand. The show requires too much concentration to be able to enjoy anything casually (which is up to personal preference), and had it just been paced better, than this would've skyrocketed perhaps another 1.0~1.5. Even so, I greatly anticipate a second season to see how this all ends out, as there are many mysteries left unsolved.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (100%) \u2014 7.7/10",

            "content": "Unlike everybody who has ever watched this, I did not like this anime. I seem to have a thing for those. Here's why : \r\nStory : 6/10\r\nThe story is surprisingly original, but hey, 2012 had a thing for original stories. For a 13-17 (however you view it) anime the story is way to rushed. The first arc, which is supposed to be the main thrill of the anime (the body switching) only lasted for 5-6 episodes. The relation ships developed too fast. Basically this anime should have been at least 20 episodes.\r\nArt : 7/10\r\nFor a 2012 anime, it is not good looking. Character designs aremeh, the first time I saw the characters I thought they all looked like a different personality than with which they were presented. When having dramatic moments, the characters sometimes looked like they were having spasm attacks.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is bad, even for a RomCom, which have low standards. The voice acting is also off. Again, in dramatic moments, the characters over-act, which becomes annoying to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAlright, I have noticed that I can make a template for this mark and not so good anime. Taichi Yaegashi : \"Project yourself plz\", Inaba Himeko : Poorly developed tomboy with feelings, Nagase Iori : \"hey let's make her have 5 different characters and feelings\", Kiriyama Yui : \"Character seems to strong, let's give her a boy phobia\", Aoki Yushifumi : I have no idea what this guy is, a weird mix of happy go lucky and hidden emotions. See what I am getting at, the characters are way to exaggerated, almost like in a shitty TV Soap Opera. They all either have too much backstory either none.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI do like myself some RomCom, so even with flaws I quite enjoyed this anime. At least I didn't cringe at the flaws that much\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is decent. If you like Soap Opera, watch it. If you don't like over dramatized stuff then don't.",

            "content": "Story: 8\r\nI've never watched an anime with body-switching that I can recall (though I am sure there probably are), so I thought that it was a fun premise for an anime!  I think so far (since I've only seen four episodes), it's done a fantastic job of investigating deeper issues about the body switching, like how it is one maintains their sense of self when they are no longer tied to one singular body.  Of course, there are a lot of funny parts about the body switching that one might expect, like what happens when a dude is suddenly in a chick's body.While I expected those type of moments, they still managed to be actually be funny!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6-7\\n\r\nThe art is not the most fantastic in the world.  I sort-of cringed when I started it--however, the story line and characters kept me going and the art grew on me as I continued! =]  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI think the opening theme is awful but the voice acting is pretty dope!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nI think the characters are very multi-dimensional and interesting!  Great background story so far and I think they act in a way that you might think teenagers would in this situation.  Nagise and Aori are the only reason I didn't put a 10.  I think because Nagise is a little too cutesy at times.  That, and I hate her hairstyle. =|  As for Aori, he is obsessed with one of the other characters and that is annoying in itself!  Uhm, and it might be the hairstyle again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  10\\n\r\nIt's funny, thought-provoking, and has really pulled me in!  They seem like a realistic friend group trying to handle a very odd situation.  And I think it is also interesting to see what kind of romances will develop.  I am hoping Taichi/Himeko. ;]\\n\\n",

            "content": "NOTE: This review includes Kokoro Connect: Michi Random (Ep. 14-17).\r\nThis anime sparked my interest with two reasons:\r\n1. Inaba Himeko did very well in Best Girl Contest. It's my quest to find out why.\r\n2. I like to see what happens with such phenomena.\r\nHow was the anime then?\r\nStory:\r\nWhat I liked the most is that it touches on the psychological dilemma or scar of the characters a lot. I mean, this anime's purpose is to investigate what would happen if you faced similar (though unrealistic) situations in life. Kokoro Connect, as it's name states, is about the connections between the five Cultural Research Club members' heart: Friendship, trust,and love. One cannot break their strong bonds even though how Heartseed uses his power to make them crumble, hence getting maximum entertainment, nor can the triangular relationship between Taichi, Iori and Himeko break them. What's more, such phenomena actually helps them to learn instead of hurting them to the worse extent possible. That's what makes the plot valuable to watch. A plot similar to Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I find is during the OPs. With the scene where the characters stand on the bridge, their appearances went bizarre mode. Nevertheless, it resembled that of K-ON!. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe OPs aren't bad, but I don't know why they just don't give me that \"Kokoro\" feeling. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nIt's disappointing that the male leads, both Taichi and Aoki, lacked the development they should have, leading to the problem that it's the girls who suffered the most. All three female leads are VERY moe and distinct though, and the characterization was done well on these three. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThat goes back to the two reasons I watched this anime in the first place. Both were achieved. Himeko IS moe and the story was satisfying. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nKokoro Connect could have been better if the male leads were developed better. 8/10.",

            "content": "My personal opinion is that a lot of people find slice of life/school comedies very unappealing because the entire setup of teenage angst and relationship problems set within an educational environment seems unoriginal and really really boring. I think that the lack of explosions is what turns off most people from watching slice of life anime. I\u2019m not against slice of life, in fact I\u2019ve seen an anime or two that surprised me and had me more excited than some of the action packed blood and boob filled shows I\u2019ve seen in the past. \r\nThere has to be some kind of hook to get theviewer watching from start to finish, because honestly who would want to watch someone argue about school and love triangles with family and friends for 13 episodes? Kokoro Connect has that as well a well executed story and fine art. It\u2019s a good show, not great, but good. This is my review. \\n\\n\r\nMINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW\\n\\n\r\nStory  \\n\r\nThe story concerns a group of five buddies in a Cultural Research School club who experience body switching  and a few other supernatural dilemmas which I won\u2019t spoil for you controlled by a soul called Heart Seed to complicate and test their friendship. This is definitely Kokoro\u2019s strongest point. The hook that I mentioned before is that the fantasy aspect of the show is approached with a lot of realism. If you take out the fantasy it would be an ordinary school comedy/drama. But that\u2019s what makes it so fun to watch. It\u2019s so different from your usual high school dramedies but has enough typical aspects to prevent the show from straying too far from the genre. The execution is perfect. It also deals with themes of love, sexual angst, spousal abuse, abandonment and androphobia which are all handled with a lot of maturity.  \\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\r\nThe animation of the show is really simple with lots of bright colours. Character designs are exaggerated for comedic slapstick purposes however this isn\u2019t done too often. Characters don\u2019t look too similar and the backgrounds range from blurry to detailed (I loved the wrestling references in the background).The school desk, chairs and clothing are all clear and colourful but the trees and wall posters appear as blurry spots of paint which bothered me a bit but this style actually began to grow on me. Oh yeah, ever notice how high school students look a lot older than they actually are?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nThis is the Kokoro\u2019s weakest point. That sounds a bit harsh because this part of the show wasn\u2019t that bad. I\u2019ll rather say it\u2019s the Kokoro\u2019s least strongest point. All five characters are likable, strong and care for each other deeply, but I feel that three of the five characters were more developed than the other two. I think trying to fully develop characters can be tricky especially if it\u2019s a group of quite a few like in Kokoro Connect and just within 13 episodes. The other thing that also bothered me was that halfway through the story after a certain event, they began to feel extremely sorry for themselves and this lasted for quite a while. I know this was done for character development and may not bother people so much because it\u2019s not really a major problem but it reached a point where I just wanted to punch the characters for all that sulking and sinking into self pity. In the end I still cared for and liked them but if their slumps didn\u2019t last so long it wouldn\u2019t have bothered me so much and wouldn\u2019t have made the story feel so repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nSound  \\n\r\nI\u2019ve never seen an ED change so much with a 13 episode anime. All the songs were alright but forgettable. They\u2019re definitely not worth writing about but all of them were pretty upbeat pop songs. I saw the dubbed version of Kokoro and the voice acting wasn\u2019t that bad. I\u2019ve loved Greg Ayres ever since I heard him in \u201cWelcome to the NHK\u201d.  Here his talents are on full display as he is the lead for once and not just a supporting character (I know it\u2019s an ensemble cast but it definitely feels like he\u2019s the lead and has the most pivotal character.) His voice just screams adolescence which is a perfect fit for Taichi (who happens to be a wrestling fan). Everyone else wasn\u2019t bad, I love how English voice actresses keep cute girly characters from being annoying. Not fantastic voice acting but far good enough to keep it from being terrible with the exception of Mr Ayres who obviously was the best of the bunch.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAll in all this was a good watch, it had an original mature story bringing something else to the slice of life/school dramedy genre and bright and bubbly art. The music and voice acting (with the exception of Greg Ayres, God I love this guy) weren\u2019t great but also not bad. I\u2019d recommend this as something to watch on a rainy day or if you\u2019re looking for an interesting fantasy story with a couple of laughs and some tear jerking moments. \\n\\n\r\n7/10 \\n",

This trulywas a masterpiece and I can clearly see why it was one of the top recommendations of Kimi no na wa.\\n\\n\r\n- Story [10] - The story was unique but really reminded me of Toradora and the long triangle between three of the characters, how even the ending is the same which I adore even more as Toradora is my favourite Slice of Life, Romance, School anime. But again with differences like the main antagonist being a supernatural forces creates some new emotions and situations these friends must solve.\\n\\n\r\n- Art [9] - There was nothing to special about the animation style but the appearance of the characters and their emotions in each seen is presented in a smooth way which allows the story to move forward.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound [10] - There are not many anime's in which I listen to all the outro's and intro's but this was that I not only enjoyed but danced to every time it played. The soundtrack for the anime for me personally was what really stood out as each scene or emotion or conflict was perfectly mixed with the music allowing for a magical experience.\\n\\n\r\n- Character [10] - These characters were created so technically that for me there was no fault or need for improvement. The reason I watched the show was not for the plot or the antagonist but was for the characters and their relationships which each other, their love and hate and each situations brought them further apart then even closer. It kept me on the edge of my chair up the end hoping that these two characters would fall in love or they would fight or finally sort out their issues. These character developments are the structure, foundation and main component for this anime and what really attracted me to the anime from episode 1 all the way to 17.",

            "content": "I haven't watched Kokoro Connect: Michi Random yet, so my opinion about 'the final four episodes of Kokoro Connect' will not be included in this.\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nThe story for Kokoro Connect was fairly unique for a romance/drama/slice of life/comedy. The supernatural element, despite being the most interesting aspect of the show, was kind of awkwardly thrust into the story (in my opinion, but this is my review anyhow) in an attempt to make it interesting. Seeing as there are still four episodes I have yet to watch, I'm hoping perhaps the supernatural portion of the show will have a smoother ending than the way Fuusenkazura/Heartseed wasleft completely unexplained. If the show had given more information about this instead of wasting some time trying to make interesting situations for the characters, perhaps I would have given an eight or nine for the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\r\nAlthough I am a fan Yukiko Horiguchi's character designs for K-On!, (as it was what initially attracted me to Kokoro Connect) it objectively is neither amazing nor disappointing. (Yes, I did check in several places, K-On! and Kokoro Connect DO share the same character designer, but for Kokoro Connect she is merely the original character designer as there is more than one.) The animation is normal for any show these days. Calling it mediocre sounds a bit harsh as it wasn't poor animation, but it wasn't anything more than what you would have expected from a romance/drama/slice of life/comedy. Since a seven on MAL is defined as 'good,' I will give this category no more and no less than what it deserves.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the first ending theme of Kokoro Connect and will probably add it to my playlist of favourite OP/ED themes. The other themes were okay, nothing you wouldn't have expected from this show, but I only listened to them once before I started skipping over them. The background music helped convey the emotion of the characters when it needed to and the voice acting was well done, thus I gave this category a seven for being 'good' but not really standing out from other shows of the same genres.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10):\\n\r\nSome spoilers here!\\n\r\nAs the synopsis hints at, each character has their own issues from the past that they are still struggling to cope with. I was really disappointed in the fact that Taichi had no apparent issues to deal with from his past. To me it merely seemed as if the writer(s) used him as the romantic aspect of the show to attract a wider audience and to give Inaba an issue to struggle with. I suppose Kokoro Connect would have been less interesting without Inaba's feelings for Taichi, as it served to create a more hopeful atmosphere later in the show after she realized her feelings and Iori chewed her out, and Taichi himself was presented as the 'hero' so he couldn't really have been given much more of a role besides a romantic interest and protagonist, but the love triangle (if you can call it that...) was left unresolved. Iori was given the best background story out of all the characters, and I believe her issues were nicely resolved at the end of the show. Kiriyama and Aoki's relationship progression was also well done, and I believe both of their character backgrounds were pretty good (despite Aoki appearing as more of a background character for comedic relief initially, he eventually scooted into the spotlight later once Kiriyama's fear was explained.) I was hoping Fujishima would also have more character development, but alas the series was only 13 episodes long and did not have enough time/room to develop anything with the background characters. With Fuusenkazura/Heartseed I was very frustrated with his lack of a background story, no true explanation for anything that was happening with the experiments he was doing on StuCS, the crap with 'a second Heartseed.' I felt he was just so awkwardly thrust into the story and occasionally just caused phenomena to give an excuse to further the character development of the main five. Not taking Heartseed into my rating of character development (because I'm pretending he wasn't even a part of this show for how the writers didn't explain jack about him), I gave it an eight for creating a few decently interesting characters (most series struggle with even that), especially Fujishima for being an unexpected variable in this sort of show. (I guess from the way Heartseed explained his reasons for the experiments in the show he was just doing what he did for 'entertainment,' but I'm not satisfied with that answer.)\\n\\n\r\nI feel as though this show deserves an eight for enjoyment, as it did not fail to keep my attention over the span of its 13 episodes and did occasionally make my kokoro go brokoro with dem feels. Overall I'm giving the show a seven as SOME aspects of the show could have had more development (love triangle) or explanation (Heartseed I & II) which would have given it a smoother ending.",

            "content": "This has got to be another one of my favorite anime of all time. \r\n(Minor Spoilers)\r\nKokoro Connect is about five students who are part of the Student Cultural Research Club and how they get themselves into supernatural phenomenons by a sentient being called \"Heart Seed.\" These phenomenons are body switching, inner desire unleashing, age reverting and inner emotion transmission. \r\nWhat was very important about this anime is Character Development. Whenever they get themselves in the middle of a phenomenon, something about them that the others didn't know is revealed. Something traumatic. Something deep and dark that the others never knew about. Despite these phenomena forcingthe five to drift apart, they don't give up on their friendship and struggle to keep them together. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, this anime didn't appeal to me quite that much. But later on, I slowly start enjoying it. The story itself is quite unrealistic, despite the fact that the setting is  school/slice-of-life. But that doesn't mean the story isn't good.  It's quite original, as far as I'm concerned. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a good mix of comedy, drama and romance. You'll start getting pissed off at some of the characters as the story progresses. The comedy is subtle. And the drama brings some heavy feels, which makes the happy endings after each phenomenon and the romance all the more satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very nice and well-done  and animation  flows rather smoothly. The character designs are quite similar to the anime K-On! despite having different producers. You could put the characters of Kokoro Connect and K-On! together and you'd probably think they were  made by the same producers. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is alright. Nothing specific to point out. Opening and the Ending themes are a little catchy, but that's it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a pretty enjoyable anime and I highly recommend watching it. I'm sure you won't regret it.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "How friendship can be more and then some!\r\nKokoro Connect for me is a under-the-radar anime about 5 friends who start a club and one day have there lives changed by unexpected events. Supernatural is the key to the show but what makes Kokoro Connect so special are the characters.  Everyone of them shine and keep your attention thoughout the 13-episode season. There is alot of short arcsthat span threw the season and while not perfect they show what friendship is all about.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory-8\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts out strong with a interesting plot of 5 friends switching body's and going back and fourth between each other. As the main members try to understand the supernatural....things only go down-hill from there. As with all plots we have only so much patience with a rushed script or sloppy pacing and I'm Afraid Kokoro Connect suffers from these points. But the story kept me interested and I did not stop watching until I finished all 13 episodes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt-10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the colors and the show looks really pretty in 1080p. I just think they did a awesome job animating the backgrounds and characters. One can only hope to see more of this animation style. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound-10 \\n\\n\r\nI felt it and it touched and moved me. I loved every moment of the Ost soundtrack and give this a blazing 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\\n\r\nI felt, understood, laughed, and wish I could have been in that clubroom! Inaba, Himeko is my favorite character of the show and I would have loved to have her as a good friend. Yaegashi, Taichi kept the show going and for some reason got the most screen time. Kiriyama, Yui and Aoki, Yoshifumi are great on the time they are given but lack more time to define there characters. Nagase, Iori is a laughable cutie who just might win you over. I enjoyed everyone of these characters and did not dislike any and that's saying alot. As we get to understand them and learn there pasts and regrets we come to understand why some secrets are best kept hidden. When they are in that clubroom that is when there characters shine and they won't holdback on giving you the viewer a good time!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\\n\r\nI was expecting a anime about simple events. What I got was what I expected but man the characters caught my attention right from the first episode and never let go. They had chemistry and frankly that is all I ask for in a anime. It's not about the setting it''s about the characters being interesting and for me kokoro Connect succeeds on all fronts. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10\\n\\n\r\nGo watch this show it will past by just like that. The ending leaves much to be desired but the characters alone and the chemistry between them will get you threw Kokoro Connect in no time. Some pasts are better left untouched but will you except a friends help to move on. Kokoro Connect asks these questions and give the viewer a hell-of-a-good-time!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The plot is rather unique and shows promise (as I'll explain in the following paragraph), although it developed a bit too fast for my liking. The art is pretty mainstream but it's also what attracted me to the show. The characters are kind of annoying, so I'm hoping they develop more throughout the anime.\r\nBrief Summary of the show:\r\nKokoro Connect is a story about 5 high schoolers that trade bodiesfor a fixed amount of time before switching back. They cannot control this, and not much is known about how this happens, and why. During this time period, each individual learns more about the person their soul is in, bringing the characters closer together throughout the show. It's a decent slice of life/romance/drama anime, so if you're interested in those genres, go for it. \\n\\n\r\nRatings:\\n\\n\r\nStory- 8/10\\n\r\nArt- 10/10\\n\r\nSound- 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters- 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 4/10 (again, I don't usually go for this genre, if you like slice of life/shoujo/drama/romance you'd probably give this a 8)\\n\r\nOverall- 6/10\\n\\n\r\nHope this helped you a bit (\u25cb\u2312\u2207\u2312\u25cb)\\n",

            "content": "(I have watched all 17 episodes of this)\r\nKokoro Connect is a story about a new group of high school friends who create a club because they really have nothing better to do and just want to spend time together. It's not the most original setup having been done in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Clannad, K-On, and many other animes, but this show still pulls off this idea well. The story begins when the club members are visited by a teacher who is the homeroom teacher for three of the five members. He is normally a cheerful and very easily manipulated teacher by his students,but instead he comes in looking like he is in a trance. It turns out that some \"interdimensional being\" (I'm not really sure what it is) is controlling him and tells the students that he is going to play a game with them. They have no choice but to surrender and go along with the game. There game changes several times during the seventeen episodes, each time giving the members a new problem and new drama to go through. In the first game, they switch bodies at random times. I won't spoil the others, but they are all interesting and keep changing enough to keep you interested and to keep messing with the students.\\n\\n\r\nIf you read on MyAnimeList or Wikipedia that this show is a comedy/drama, and you're expecting the comedy level to be about even without the drama, then you're mistaken. There are several sexual jokes in this show that are funny, but for the most part this show is a sad drama/psychological look at five normal high school students with normal problems and how those problems are all brought to the surface in an extreme situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is good, but really not something mind-blowing as is the sound in the show. On another note, the openings never really impressed me, but the third ending song (Episodes 10-13 I believe) is one of my favorite ever.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I think this show really succeed in is the characters. Inaba Himeko is my favorite female anime character. She is the one who tries to act mature and help everyone in the group, but she ends up forgetting to help herself and ends if in deeper problems sometimes because of it. The main character, Taichi, is not one of the strongest main characters I've seen, but he is still a good character. He act the mediator in the group helping everyone else get over their problems. He also has the least actual problems himself (at least at most times). The last character I'll mention is Iori. She seems like your typical comic-relief character at first, but it is revealed pretty quickly that she has more psychological problems than anyone else in the group. Towards the end it gets a little annoying at points how all the other characters seem to not realize what is wrong with her, but I still like her character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really liked this anime, and it's one of my favorite romance series. It takes a normal, school-club situation and does it well with the added supernatural body swapping, etc. games thrown in as a more original idea.",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect is definitely one of the most unforgettable anime I have ever seen and probably ever will see. The inner and outer struggles that the characters face are struggles any of us could face and the way they resolve the issues that come up are, more than anything, completely human; not perfect or ideal but this anime teaches us that\u2019s it\u2019s okay not to be perfect as long as you can be happy with who you are at the end of the day. With that said, I\u2019ll delve into the score and details, starting with an overall assessment and then breaking it down morea little later.\\n\\n\r\n*Before you read: I take into account the 4 episode special in my ratings but the review itself is spoiler free*\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nTo give a short summary, this anime is about a group of high school students who suddenly undergo a series of weird phenomena, the first one of which causes them to switch bodies randomly. During these strange occurrences the character\u2019s inner struggles are revealed and they learn more about each other and themselves. The thing I loved about this anime was that even though it\u2019s a fun school-life anime on the surface, when the plot really gets going, it can get extremely intense and plays with the ideas of who we are and how we define who we are. The characters are extremely relatable and very down-to-earth and the development occurs at a pace that is very reminiscent of our own development. People aren\u2019t just cured from their traumas and insecurities overnight, and neither are these characters. They have moments when they shine, reflect, and even regress before they can say they\u2019ve reached significant character development, and as these characters question themselves, you also start questioning your own self and finding yourself asking the same questions they are. This is one of those anime that I think everyone and anyone can watch and enjoy. If you want to draw parallels I would say that this anime reminded me most of Steins;gate, so if you like one I\u2019m pretty confident you\u2019ll like the other. Even if you\u2019re purely into romantic comedy shoujos, or action-hero shonens, I still think this anime is worth watching. It\u2019s only 13+4 episodes (17 total but the last 4 eps were released as a special) so I say definitely give it a shot!\\n\\n\r\nNow I\u2019ll get to some details I\u2019d like to discuss:\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe story was really interesting right from the first episode. There are few anime that can really get me interested from episode 1 but Kokoro Connect got right to the point of the story and didn\u2019t keep me guessing for long. The whole point of the anime is that strange phenomena  start happening to a club of 5 friends in a high school, the first of which causes them to randomly switch bodies. These phenomena reveal their insecurities and fears and help them resolve their struggles together. At the beginning all the characters are switching bodies and it\u2019s funny and entertaining and you start learning more about the characters and what they\u2019re going through, until all of a sudden it turns into something twisted and dark before finally mixing the two elements together into something funny but deep, leaving you with a sense that it was a fun and romantic show but that it really tackled some heavy issues with some supernatural elements involved. More than once I found parts of the anime messing with my head because it really delves into serious issues of who we are and how we can deal with the personas we\u2019ve set up to shield ourselves from the world without losing sight of our true selves. In the end I found that the story was very well paced and made complete sense all throughout, without making the issues too complex. It didn\u2019t focus at all on what the supernatural occurrences were or why they were happening, it really focused on the characters and their development and struggles, making it more \u201cslice of life\u201d than \u201cfantasy.\u201d The reason it\u2019s not a 10 is because of some unresolved plot stuff I\u2019d rather not spoil for you but it\u2019s not completely essential to the story so I guess they could just leave it out or discuss it in season 2 (if they make one, I\u2019m not sure where that stands right now). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I even begin with these amazing characters. I was completely impressed by the characters and their development. Each character has his or her own struggles that they need to work through, and like real people, each one can tackle their struggles at their own pace. Some issues were resolved faster than others but some traumas were deeper than others. The development didn\u2019t feel artificial or forced at all, it came out as genuine and sincere and was, all in all, very well-paced. The whole experience of these phenomena makes the characters look deeper into themselves and each other and helps them realize who they are and who their ideal self is. At many points, the phenomena start tearing them apart as the one responsible (called Heartseed according to Crunchyroll translation) is just starting fires in their lives for his own entertainment. As events unfold, their worst insecurities and fears are revealed and they discover that the only way they can get through the whole ordeal is by doing so together. Each character had their own struggles but they also each had their own strengths. That\u2019s what was so great about watching each character go through their own ordeals and helping each other get through them as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was really good, and probably what you\u2019d expect from a school life type anime and it really fit the plot and anime so I guess it did it\u2019s job in telling the right story without causing too much distraction. No complaints about animation but it wasn\u2019t amazing or anything so it gets an 7.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs were also well done in general and the soundtrack during the episodes also fit the plot well and really made you feel exactly what you were supposed to be feeling during each scene so extra points for that. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Notes:\\n\\n\r\nWatch it. Watch it right now. It\u2019s really an amazing anime and even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019ll fit in with the type of anime you\u2019re usually into, no matter what you\u2019re into, you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s one of those universal anime that anyone can relate to and enjoy so if you\u2019re looking for a new anime to watch this summer, look no further. You\u2019ll find the first 13 eps on Crunchyroll. (Oh and don\u2019t forget the last 4 episodes which are not on CR. They were released as a special called Kokoro Connect MichiRandom Specials but if you just google Kokoro Connect Episode 14 you\u2019ll find them subbed).",

The first time around I watched it, I don't know, I was bored but I still wanted to continue watching it. It was just interesting but that's just it. I thought it was missing a few things to making it more than just interesting. Sure, it did make me laugh and all and confused in some parts and almost cry in sad parts but I still felt bored but wanted to keep watching it.\r\nArt: 9\r\nThe art was good. The characters were drawn nice and the backgrounds were good.\r\nSound: 10\r\nThe soundtracksand the acting were both amazing. I especially liked how they ended the episode in the first ending song. How they would show the next episode preview first and then leaves you hanging a bit by cutting it off and going into the song. I don't know how to explain it but it was really good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 \\n\r\nThe characters were interesting too. I can't really give the ways the character goes as that might spoil it a bit. All I can say is I can really put myself in their shoes and understand how they feel.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI can't really say anything about this and I'll leave it to overall.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThe plot was interesting but boring, art was nice and detailed, sound was really great and moved me a bit more than the plot, characters were good looking and they were understandable, and I did enjoy this anime. After finishing it, it left me with some questions and the anime lacked something to make me enjoy it to it's fullest so that's why I can't give it a 10 but otherwise, I enjoyed it and it's a good anime so yes, I would recommend it definitely.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a while, I don't know why but it just drew me back to it. I feel like I want to watch it again so that's what I'm going to do.",

            "content": "Definitely one of the more story heavy animes out there.  For anyone who's wondering, this is more in the Drama section than comedy.  I would almost say it has a similar atmosphere to Bokurano but its not very bleak or anything like that one is.  \r\nStory 8/10\r\nGreat story, and great premise, and like I said earlier, the anime has a very thick atmosphere like Bokurano.  I do feel that the story feels rather convenient at times though. \r\nArt 10/10\r\nHard to say how to judge this one.  I say a 10 because they are doing a high quality job animating theseries, This is definitely one of the better animation jobs. The art is also very realistic.  They try and make the characters look like real people.  Everything else is personal preference.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nNothing really annoying about the sound.  They aren't trying to excite anyone, but they aren't doing a bad job either.  It's sound that conveys a realistic drama series.  That said, I took a mark off because I didn't feel the opening/ending music was anything special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nHeartseed is definitely the best character, and the girls come off as realistic, but I get the feeling that the boys are underused.  That and Taichi kinda sucks, he's probably the biggest flaw in the series.  A cliche \"selfless guy\" character who is overused and solves the other characters emotional problems way too easily.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nDefinitely a drama held up my heartseed's cruel games and the character exploration that this unique show provides.  That said, it felt like a bunch of really great ideas strung together without enough forethought.  Most people will definitely enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10",

            "content": "When I first watched this anime, I marathoned through almost all of it (got to episode 15), and finished the rest the next day. I was absolutely hooked, and because of that my first-time experience was ironically almost ruined. I did not understand the implications of a lot of things that happened, and never thought about the \"why\" behind certain plot twists and changes.\r\n(I'm writing this after I have watched the last 4 episodes, or apparently called the \"special.\" I recommend all of you to watch the ending immediately after episode 13 because it is essentially concluding the anime. Episode 13 does not offer aconcise conclusion in my opinion.)\\n\\n\r\nBefore I go any further, I would give a cautionary recommendation for this anime. It's good, really really good, but some parts of the \"good\" are hard to swallow, especially if you are like me, too used to the typical path of anime storylines. It has a huge dose of realism, which is good to bring us back to reality, but not the best if we like to stay in anime heaven.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThere is not much of a \"story\" since it is more like the everyday activities of high school students (with the addition of magical elements). There is no intended goal at the end like finding something or saving someone. Rather, there are many smaller stories intertwined together. Most of the stories arise from the main characters exposing their struggles and the other characters' attempts to ease and eventually eliminate such struggles.\\n\\n\r\nIt could be argued that the main goal/plot was to philosophically answer such questions as: if the outside part of us was completely changed, would we still be ourselves? Would people recognize us for who we are, not what we look or seem to be like? It is true that all of the supernatural happenings deal with characters either switching or exposing parts of themselves, which in turn questions what/who a person really is.\\n\\n\r\nAnother possible purpose could be to examine the effects of destroying the status quo. If our lives were drastically changed, would be willing just like these characters to easily express our doubts and personal struggles? Would our friends and family be like the group in this anime, offering advice and help, even going so far as to sacrifice time and emotions to save us? What if the anime wanted us to stop going through the motions and realize that everybody has something they want just as much to hide as they want to heal?\\n\\n\r\nIt is very interesting how every character's struggles could be considered the main plot, or at least a sub-plot. There is no explicit \"main\" story, simply an array of stories that comprise the entirety of the anime. This may seem confusing at first, but they have a lot of connections.\\n\\n\r\nI do realize I started off saying there was no plot, and then continued on giving possibility of certain plots. If an anime focused on many plots, is there a plot at all? I hope that paradox helps settle my contradictory tone.\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, I find there to be a huge connection between the storyline and the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are immediately forced to lead two-faced lives (regardless of how many faces they already had before :O) because of the supernatural occurrences that are affecting them directly. Although there is very little or no transition from one supernatural phenomenon to the next, what it does very well is subsequently build character development.\\n\\n\r\nAs soon as the supernaturals came to be, the characters became three-dimensional. This I can relate very well in reality. I find a huge struggle in everyday life is being more than just a shallow, quiet entity. If we constantly lived in our own little worlds and followed the status quo, would we ever consider opening ourselves up? This anime beautifully portrays what we ought to do when our world turns upside-down. Perhaps beforehand, we never thought about sharing our deepest, darkest secrets with anyone. We would rather die than do that. We would live in our comfortable reality forever, with no thought of trying to change.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, until the world forces us to change. That is what happens in Kokoro Connect. Before the supernatural occurrence, it is implied that the characters never shared their troubles. They simply went to school as everybody else did, going through the motions. Everybody seemed \"happy\" when in reality all of them were going through difficult things. It was only when the so-called antagonist came and ruined their lives when they finally became human. Imperfect humans.\\n\\n\r\nBut I know I would prefer anime humans over anime robots.\\n\\n\r\nIt's interesting to note that there really is no antagonist in this story. That entity that is the closest to be considered the \"bad guy\" actually helped the characters see themselves and others in a new light: a light that exposes instead of hides away.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nIt is the amplifier of all events. It brings the normalcy in normal school activities, pain in grievous moments, and laughs in humorous occasions. It is always there to make everything seem so much more real. That itself is ironic because real life never really has a soundtrack (maybe play your iPhone during a romantic dinner).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI am not a good judge on art and style, but I'm sure it's not out-of-the-box to say that this anime is very pretty, both in its people and its environment. It's nice to note that important scenes brought more memorable scenery, while not-so-important scenes brought more forgetful scenery. Perhaps this happens in every anime, but it is the first time I noticed it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI forgot to mention the romance the love present in the anime when talking about story and character, so I will place it here. There is a lot of romance (perhaps that is another plot possibility...), but I find it hard to call it \"romance.\" Just as the 3-dimensional aspect of the characters were created through the supernatural events, so too did the romantic feelings. If we placed the romantic feelings out of the context of Kokoro Connect and in the context of another anime without weird things happening, would there still be a romance at all? Is that a question worth answering?\\n\\n\r\nBefore I go too deep in ponderous questions, I do want to point out that the anime seems to have two contradictory definitions of love; love is fragile, yet at the same time it seems to bring \"happily ever after.\" It easily crushed two people's romance when it built another seemingly indestructible romance between two other people. I was greatly confused at the purpose for that, and at this time still do no fully understand why they did what they did. Perhaps love is like that, sometimes there for only a while, sometimes there for eternity.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the anime because of its huge variety of emotions it expressed. There were the funny moments and the sad moments, the times of revelation and the times of hiding, the fighting and the healing. Some things changed that I didn't like, but it's not like everything in life is preferable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nI almost hesitate to give it a 9 because of my adverse feelings toward the anime after my first watch-through. However, before I decided to write a review, I went back and re-watched it, and found out that the uncomfortable feelings the anime gave me were actually blessings in disguise. They were the golden nuggets of life-lessons we can apply for ourselves.\\n\\n\r\nSo if any of you are thinking of watching this anime, by all means do so, but do so with an open mind. Some parts may seem different than the cliche anime, but that's what makes it so amazing.\\n\\n\r\nKokoro Connect - Our Hearts have Connected~",

            "content": "This show could have been better, not saying it was trash or anything, but it could have gone differently. The first couple episodes introduce a promising story about five kids who over the course of one night are experiencing out of (their) body situations. All five of the students are swapping minds without knowing when or really how, and it is interfering with them trying to keep a normal life. Now that sounds pretty good, and it was for the most part, but the story advances to them having a different problem later on. The characters in the show were okay, although there weren't anyhuge conflicts between the characters that would linger on throughout a span of a few episodes. Since they are good friends they would forgive each other of their problems instantly, but since this show tried to to be a drama as well as a romance, it would have been better for a conflict to linger. This is what I meant by things could have gone differently, the show was good, but it's little details like this that could have made it a little different.\\n\\n\r\nFor people that have seen the show, wouldn't it have been better if they were to have just capitalized on the mind swapping idea for a little longer? I mean, the other problems were entertaining, but the original idea was pretty great! The mind problem never really created problems at the characters houses, which that would have been pretty nice to see. Sure we saw a few scenes were they tried to be each other at one another's house, but it was never really an issue. I just wish the issues would have torn the friends lives apart a little more, that would have been entertaining.",

            "content": "Story 7/10 - The story is set around a group of 5 friends who are in the Student cultural research club, they start to experience strange supernatural events that happens only to them, the strong point of this story is that we get given a good look at how these events affect each character differently and how it affects the entire friendship of the group. The only complaint I have is that the pacing does get a bit slower around about episode 9-10. \r\nArt & Sound 6/10 - Art is good and is nicely presentable, the environment and characters are nice and smooth as well.Sound is equally as a good, and the anime has a good and catchy opening song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10  - The main characters are Taichi Yaegashi, Iori Nagase, Himeko Inaba, Yoshifumi Aoki and Yui Kiriyama. The personality of these characters are shown off well, we see how they try to cope with the mental strain of the events, and how this almost changes them completely. The antagonist is even better, it goes by the name of Heartseed and he is the cause of these events. We are given no physcal image and as such have no idea who or what  Heartseed is especially because it takes over the body of Ry\u016bzen Got\u014d, the club advisor of the main characters. The mystery around heartseed increases when we learn that there is more then 1 \"heartseed\" and this \"other one\" has a much different way of playing with the 5 teens. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10 - This anime is very enjoyable especially with the mystique surrounding Heartseed which is really beneficial to the anime as it creates an air of superstition. The characters attempts to manage thier lives despite these events is also enjoyable especially as they can't tell others about these events, after all who would believe them?. As previous mentioned, the anime does run into some pacing issues around the 2nd half but it doesn't affect the quality of the story too much. \\n",

            "content": "-Will edit as the show progresses-\r\nHonestly I never really expected much to come out of watching this but well... i guess i didn't think I'd like this so much.\r\nStory: Ok people randomly swapping bodies, how exactly can you say that THIS isn't original. I like how the story progresses with the characters trying their best to cope with the problems brought about by the body swapping business and *ahem* some other problems they face later on in the show. I also like how this anime doesn't force anything and the events somehow seems to fall into place on its own without anything being rushed. It'salso interesting how everything happens unexpectedly and when you expect something, something else happens instead.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for this anime is actually quite well done. Nothing too spectacular but still very good nonetheless. The thing i like about the art is that although it's simple, it isn't excessive and it's still good. Character designs are also really great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Well no complaints for the opening and ending, both are good and i think they're a factor that attracts people to watch this anime. The only complaint i have is that they really should have more OST's in this anime as i think there aren't enough. The current ending is especially good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5 unique characters which are all interesting in their own right, what more can you ask for? Each character seems to each fill a role in the group and although they may appear to be just a slightly unordinary bunch of students, they are still interesting. Character development it also well paced and it's interesting to see the 5 of them as they deal with the problems that they face while helping each other with personal issues as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well i doubt that anybody can say that this anime is boring or anything like that. this anime is actually rather nice to watch although it may not exactly pull you in right from the start. Give it some time and it'll definitely prove that it's worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Worth watching, possibly the best anime for the year although it's hard to say at the moment. Nevertheless don't skip this anime without giving it a try if not you'll be missing out on something really good",

Wow, I was wrong The story started as a Freaky Friday scenario but but had its own twists, and in its own is a one in a kind anime.Yes it did have a love triangle but it didn't end the way most love triangles in anime do.\r\n It had great character development, showing why the charters acted the way they did. And it explored in depth inter-character relationships.\r\nOverall this is a most watchanime that will make you smile and make you cry. It shows what will happen when your friends truly see who you are, what your thoughts and what your deepest darkest desires are. I give Kokoro Connect a perfect 10/10",

Well I was wrong on so many levels and to be honest I am glad. It has a bit of humor,sadness,questions and a dark side to it and works all the aspects very very well. So well in fact that I can find nothing wrong with the way that the story is progressing thus far. The only real complaint that I have thus far is the way the animation as it could havebeen a bit better but is good nonetheless. If you are looking for a good anime that will make you laugh wonder and leave you wanting a little more than this is one is for you.",

Looks kinda boring but let me try it.\r\n The first episode looked like the show was ganna end up like a boring slice of life show, seeing all the cute stuff like the opening sequence and the jokes; but boy was I wrong.\r\nI tried one more episode, and it looked like it gotten more serious.... By episode 3, holy crap did it become heavy. Really heavy. Anime drama heavy, which is  what I like watching. Every character I liked a lot,expect for this ONE character (no spoilers review) but that was all opinion. \\n\\n\r\nEach episode was mad entertaining, it had humor in the right places and knows when to build up tension when drama shiet happens. \\n\r\nThe show goes for 13 episodes, but then there is the finale 14-17 called Kokoro Connect: Michi Random (not on crunchyroll)    \\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the series is THEE BESTT and it ties ALMOST all loose ends.\\n\r\n It ends well, it doesn't just end as if there should be a continuation.\\n\\n\r\nI love these type of anime genres, and this goes hand and hand with the other ones such as ToraDora, Anohana, or Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, etc.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, since the ending made me happy I was gonna give it a 9/10, but now 9.5/10",

            "content": "Overview: Kokoro Connect is by far the best slice of life genre anime that I have ever seen. It has amazing characters, a great plot, and fantastic dialogue and writing. This series is what all Slice of Life anime should aspire to be. \r\n(NOTE): I should state now, that when I say Slice of Life, I don't really mean it in the purest sense. I am aware that Slice of Life anime are really things like Aria the Animation, or K-on!, but I consider series such as Clannad, Toradora, etc. to be Slice of Life. \r\nStory: 33/37\r\nThe story of Kokoro Connect gets a 33/37 andis the weakest part of it, so that should tell you something. Being an odd number of episodes, the story is broken up into 4 distinct arcs. Each of these arcs corresponds to a phenomenon that the five main characters are put through. The first one is in the plot synopsis, and is a arc all about random body swapping. Now, right here, with reading only the synopsis, it's easy to dismiss this anime as some fan-service ridden school fest (not that there aren't good anime of that type), but Kokoro Connect is anything but that. Each Arc lets the friends find out more about each other and, as the \u201cantagonist\u201d puts it, they all get something good out of it. However, each arc also has a central conflict that's... well, not Higurashi dark, but dark for a slice of life anime. To put it simply, the show is not afraid to get really serious, and does so more often than not. It's in these serious moments (although I shouldn't discredit the rest of the show, because there are TONS of hilarious and cute moments) that the show truly shines to me. The reason for that, is because Kokoro Connect is, in my opinion, the most realistic series out there. Now, I don't mean realistic in the purest sense, because they swap bodies, read each others minds, and turn into child versions of themselves, but I mean realistic in their approach to everything. In almost EVERY anime, especially Slice of Life anime, the majority of dramatic moments just feel so contrived. Not so in Kokoro Connect, every single conflict, every single reaction, even, feels like something that I could see myself doing or saying in the situations these characters are in. There aren't any hyper-dense main characters, or any over-the-top moments. I honestly can't stress enough how important and rare (if not non-existent) this is in anime. This alone is why all other anime should learn from this series. The only reason I subtract points from Kokoro Connect, is because of the third arc. To be completely honest, the third story arc is good, and there's nothing wrong with it, but... compared to how flawless the other three arcs are, it's just lackluster enough to take points off of the total score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 37/37\\n\r\nKokoro Connect has the best collective cast in any anime that I have seen. Not only is there an awesome Male Lead, but every single one of the five main characters, along with most of the side characters start out great, and develop greatly. Even Aoki Yoshifuma, who gets by far the least amount of development is so much better than most anime characters out there. To give you an idea of what to expect, my friend describes Himeko Inaba as the perfect cross between Ritsu from K-on!, and Mikasa from Shingeki no Kyojin, and that description isn't too far off in my opinion. To make it even better, I will restate what I said earlier in the Story section. The characters are just so realistic. There were no points that I can remember EVER thinking, even a little, to myself that their responses to given situations were weird, and would never happen in real life. Even their banter was just too well written. Actually, if I had to put it in words, I'd just say that the entire dialogue for every character was absolutely perfect. While Rintarou Okabe may be my favorite Male Lead, and Gasai Yuno my favorite Female Lead, aevery character in Kokoro Connect holds their own when compared to both of my ultimate examples.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 22/25\\n\r\nNormally I don't talk much about the art, because I really only watch anime with graphics that I can get into. However, I do think that the aesthetics of Kokoro Connect deserve at least a little bit of a shout out, because they are just great. The characters are really fluid, the guys are cool looking, the girls are cute, the backgrounds are really colourful, and, while this might seem inane, each of the main characters has a different hair colour!\\n\r\nThe sound is Kokoro Connect is really good. There are a few things that decide sound for me: the opening/ending (more emphasis on the OP), series soundtracks, and voices/sound effects. The OP and ED were both average, with the OP being a bit better, but nothing I go out of my way to listen to. The background music is actually really good. I particularly liked the harmonica piece that plays during peaceful moments. The voice actors/actresses all are simply amazing, and pull off the BRILLIANT writing very well. The sound effects are essentially irrelevant. \\n\\n\r\nRomance: 1/1\\n\r\nThis section is basically whether or not there was a romance that I enjoyed. Sorry if this is a spoiler, but I particularly enjoy watching a romance develop, and I wished that other reviews would tell me if I was going to get to see one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 93/100\\n\r\nHere it is: the highest score given to any of the anime I have, or will review for the next while until I find something that can surpass it. While in terms of my personal enjoyment, I can't place this above Mirai Nikki or Steins;Gate, I can safely say that this ranks in my top 5 anime, and might even be number 3. This anime should be watched by every single fan of the genre, and even many that aren't a fan of it. Even if Clannad and Toradora are considered the classics of the Slice of Life genre, they just plain out, aren't as good as this one. \\n\\n\r\nDeductions in points from the score will be listed here, just in case anything that I subtract means more or less to you, although I didn't deduct almost any points from this masterpiece:\\n\r\n-The third story arc, while still extremely good, isn't up to par with the 1st, 2nd, and final arcs.\\n\r\n-The sound and art are great, but I cannot give anything except Shingeki no Kyojin a perfect 25/25 since, even though I think it's overrated, nothing else even comes close to it in that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have any questions about my review (or want to talk about anything at all, really), feel free to email me at: nickwillis64@gmail.com\\n",

While they become more disturbed, they decide to keep this phenomenon to themselves because who would believe them. They eventually meet Heartseed, some strange and mysterious entity who takes control of the club advisor, he is the one who is causing and controlling the strange events.

The best part of this anime is how they are mentally affected by the disturbances. Heartseed, in my opinion, is probably one of the best characters in anime. You never see his actual body, you don't know if he is a supernatural entity or an alien or god knows what. And to make matters worse, there's more then one heartseed. It's a shame there is no 2nd season to explore him more. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - If you like psychological thriler then you'll love it. \\n\\n\\n",

Just needless imo and i never like it when any show does this.\\n\\n\r\n: Some times the characters can have kind of lame or just eh character motivations.\\n\\n\r\n: Episode 13 has Taichi the MC tell everyone a secret he was told not to otherwise he will regret it. Only reason why he told them is cause the group of people asked a couple times. If it wasn't for Ex Machina he would have screwed over his friends.\\n\\n\r\n: Episode 13 has Iroris mom keeping a loud, Abusive and Drunk man in the house that used to be her 2nd husband. Only reason why she is doing it is cause the mom thinks the daughter wants him to be there.\\n\\n\r\n:Episode 13 has Yui's drama end kind of rushed. She doesn't tell her Rival what was wrong or even spend any time with her rival.\\n\\n\r\n:Episode 13 proposed an interesting scenario that they never did. Inori could be sent back in time and fix the mistakes that she has been wanting to do. This would have been awesome if it did this Have her go back and maybe slowly start realizing that she is happy with how she is now. Or even send all three girls back sense they all have childhood issues. I feel this is a missed chance.\\n\\n\r\n:Yui seems like she never told her friends or family that she was once almost raped. Makes no sense as to why and just kind of annoy's me.\\n\\n\r\n:Episode 17 The club room got thrashed. No one decided to get a teacher or anything. They just immediatly start cleaning up and were about to get to work and restarting it.\\n\\n\r\n:Episode 17 has 3 guys kidnap on of the characters. The other characters find where they took her and they don't bother calling the Police to get help and decide to go in by themself. Near the end it's shown that one has a knife to the kidnapped throat. After this entire thing is resolved no one calls the police and it later comes back to bite them when for no reason one of the guys come running out of no where with a pipe and hits them. They still don't call the police after one of them is injured by a bat to the head. Not even an ambulence \\n\\n\r\n: Sense they decided this needs a love triangle. We are obvious pit against two love options. Either Inaba or Iori. No matter what some people are gonna be unhappy. I just kind of disliked the way they did it in the end. I do feel that who the MC got with does fit him better then the other girl. It's just this could have not been an issue if they didn't have a love interest at all. \\n\\n\r\nGreat show to watch overall. Even though it may look like there is a lot more issues then pros. It's just i'm not mentioning all the Pros.",

Shes such a genius she knows the inner feelings of everyone to a tee and always tells the main character exactly what to do. Almost all the characters never shut up about their mundane problems and nearly every episode a character runs away and cries over nothing. The romance isn't terrible because there is barely any and the one thing I really rememberabout the show is when at the end of one episode our main character reveals dark secret. The Art is fine if one frame is in a vacuum but doesn't look very good in motion otherwise it's fine. The sound doesn't have any problems or good sides. The story as a concept is fine a bunch of character with problems all have to work together to solve them through supernatural phenomena. In practice however it's bogged down by the shitty dialogue and melodrama.",

            "content": "I really, really liked Kokoro Connect. I know there has been a fair amount of controversy surrounding this anime due to outside events and such, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m giving my view on. I\u2019m focussing on the anime itself, and the anime only.\r\nSound: 8\r\n The opening and ending themes are nice enough, as is the rest of the music, and the voice actors are superb. An arc like the first in Kokoro Connect is very hard to pull off, and it was acted out exceedingly well. It felt natural. \r\nArt/animation: 8 \r\nThe art was cute and the animation was done in a way thatdidn\u2019t divert focus off the other aspects of the story - no ridiculous colour palette or flashy actions scenes to be had here. The show was about the characters, not about the art or animation, and so I have no complaints. On the contrary, I ended up focussing more deeply on the other areas than I would have done otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 7\\n\r\nThe anime wasn\u2019t really about the plot, and it showed. Many things were glossed over or left unexplained at the end of the story, and, whilst this did add a mystery aspect, it also felt a little random. The characters obviously needed events to force their development, and these fit the bill, but there still could have been more explanation as to why certain things happened and how they were possible. One of the character\u2019s identities could also have been explored better (without giving any spoilers away).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nI know a lot of people have praised the character development in this series, and for good reason; it was fantastic! Not only were all the main characters pretty well fleshed out through backstory (of course some received more attention than others but not by much), their interactions with each other were just so incredibly written. Their relationships progressed (some even into romance, which was handled decently, if a bit optimistically), as bonds were formed, and as a result they all grew mentally. Although they were reacting to a somewhat supernatural event, their reactions seemed realistic and relatable.\\n\\n\r\nEach individual had their own interesting personality \u2013 made interesting because of how their personality interacted and clashed with the other personalities in the story. A particular favourite of mine was Inaba, she was probably the best executed version of her trope that I\u2019ve ever seen and arguably progressed the most out of all the characters - It really felt like she was maturing through the series. (It actually even made me feel proud to watch her in the later episodes as she learnt to stop walling her emotions up and trust in others a little more; I was invested in her that much!) \ud83d\ude0a Taichi\u2019s character, on the other hand, was the blandest of them all, but this was due to him being the foil for the other characters. There has to be one person that encourages the others to develop, and Taichi did a good job in this role.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThere\u2019s just something really appealing about watching a show filled with such great characters. At times I found myself smiling, laughing, shouting at my laptop, or even on the brink of tears. I ended up clicking on the next episode as soon as I\u2019d finished one, so much so that I completed the anime in a mere two sittings (to the detriment of other things), and I had fun doing so. That, to me, is the hallmark of a great anime, and consequently my reason for scoring it so highly.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a great choice if you're looking for a drama, shoujo or slice of life with some depth to it.\\n",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect is definitely one of the most inspiring anime I've seen.\r\nStory (10):  The story starts out by introducing the members of the Cultural Research Club (or Student Cultural Society Club). There has been something strange going on recently: random members of the group had started switching bodies at random times! The students learn that someone named Heartseed (referred to as Balloon Vine in some versions of subtitles) is behind this phenomenon. Throughout the series, Heartseed keeps throwing different types of phenomena at the club members, and it's up to them to overcome this. The story has a good pace: it doesn't rush throughimportant scenes and doesn't take unnecessary time with less important ones. The topics that this anime brings up about bonds, trust, and overcoming obstacles leaves you thinking.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10): I'm very picky about art styles, but this one was an absolute pass! The art didn't distract me from the anime because it was realistic (especially characters bodies; they actually looked like normal human beings). Its very colorful, yet has a very slight sepia feeling to it (which I thought helped establish the mood). \\n\\n\r\nSound (9): The music and sound didn't distract me from the story, either. When there was music playing, it blended in perfectly to the scene. It also helped establish mood. I didn't give it a full 10 because the music didn't leave a big impression on me after the anime ended. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10): The characters in Kokoro Connect are so well presented that they could have been actual people! Each character is unique and has his or her own weaknesses, and throughout the story, they work to overcome them. They're very realistic, and their thoughts are believable. Although one character in the anime (Aoki) doesn't have as much spotlight as the others, it didn't disturb me. The rate in which the characters change and develop is perfect; I haven't seen as realistic characters as in Kokoro Connect.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): Kokoro Connect has a lot of serious moments, but enough comedy is mixed in to make it believable and enjoyable. The story led me on and made me want to keep watching. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (10): Overall, Kokoro Concert was one of the best anime I've ever seen. It's truly inspiring and leaves you thinking. You HAVE TO watch the next four \"sequel\" episodes after you watch this series because the last dialogue in the series would stir up confusion and the next episodes will satisfy you!",

            "content": "Note that this review included Michi Random, as I don't consider them separate series.\r\nWhat an emotional roller coaster.\r\nWith the final four episodes finally out, I can now review my favourite anime of 2012, Kokoro Connect. The goal of any series should be to create an emotional impact for the viewer, and Kokoro Connect succeeds flawlessly. I found myself going for angry to laughing to tense to sad to happy in a matter of 24 minutes every week. \r\nEach of the five characters are completely different from each other and have very distinct personalities, and there are no archetypes to be found. The characters and theirinteractions are what makes this anime so good. You genuinely like and care for each one, and you're constantly kept at the edge of your seat with everything that happens to them. You cheer for their triumphs and cry at their failures. When they fight you want them to make up, and when they do something stupid you want to yell at them.  By the end of series you truly feel like you know them.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is amazing, and this is especially apparent during the first arc. When the characters switch bodies, you can still tell it's them by their way of speaking. The ability of the seiyuu to imitate the speech mannerisms of the others is truly impressive. Sawashiro Miyuki steals the show with her performance as Inaba. I was truly moved by her passion and realism.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is great as well. The characters are look very 'real', but still have a very anime appearance. The animation during more intense moments is fluid and detailed.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it's hard to imagine teenagers in real life thinking as deeply and making such eloquent speeches to each other as they do in the show, the messages are undeniably powerful and ring true. While there's a lot of them, the series does not feel preachy or seem like it's trying too hard.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an amazing show, and I fear that it won't get the recognition it deserves. I give Kokoro Connect a full10 and I'm very sad that it's over.",

And that should tell you alot, if i have to forgive an anime because of it's genre and it's still a 7.4, you'll probably like it if you're into said genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting and story is your average japanese highschool heaven were a bunch of \"normal\"(as normal as maincharacters get) highschool kids experience supernatural events like body-switching and mind-reading. This in turn acts as a catalyst for all of the character developement throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the show fails me is when (way too often(like, constantly!)) plot-points would resolve out of the most extreme sheer convenience. And that shit bugged the crap out of me. It's like the show want's to show you reality but then ultimately pulls out to quick and comes all over you with unicorns, shiny rainbows, and magic-happiness which rates everything it touches PG-8.\\n\\n\r\n-Eh, you don't like MrAssholeAbusive-kun? Well neither do I! Let's solve this problem we've been talking about for several episodes with a 2 second off-screen ass-kicking!\\n\r\n-B-but he's been a major focal point of the story for so long, should we really insult the viewers by resolving something this important like it was so easy it makes you wanna puke?\\n\r\n-Fuck yeah WorstGirl-chan!\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of it, Kokoro Connect gets two ratings.\\n\r\n8/10 if I compare it to every other romcom (and temporarily forget the existence of Toradora and Clannad)\\n\r\n7/10 if I don't compare it to shi- other shows.\\n\\n\r\nAnd keep in mind that I'm not an avid romcom fan. If you like romcoms you'll like Connect, it does alot of things atleast semi-correctly, which is more than I've come to expect from this type of show.",

Ignoring the dreadful commoner High School life parts, the story is quite fascinating. \r\nArt(7): As with most 21st century Anime, the Art is eye pleasing and the shade of colors at times convey the level of seriousness in a scene with vivid colors.\r\nSound(7): Much of the music is of high quality and thesound effects are quite realistic, however the music often blends in with the background noise, unnoticed by the conscious mind.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(9): The Characters are entertaining to observe indeed. It is always enjoyable to guess who will have a mental breakdown first, only to be surprised an episode later. Certainly a game worth playing while watching Kokoro Connect. There is a good assortment of characters such that several personality types can be tested, to inquire into which personality type is the most resistant to a given type of mental stress. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(7): Quite enjoyable if you are one who enjoys the drama of the struggles of others. \\n\\n\r\nOverall(7): A delightful afternoon tea type of anime, it is most entertaining to observe how the characters handle psychological stress and their desperate attempts to prevent a mental breakdown was quite.........[What the hell do you think you are doing?!

            "content": "After blasting through the hype-train megaforce fist-pumping heaven piercing Sword Art Online, I decided to not do what I usually do when I finish such an eventful journey, which is to have a little break to breathe, cook some ramen, troll Facebook and maybe even give that TV thing all those \u201cnormal\u201d people keep ranting on about. But no, for the first time EVER (no, seriously) I scrapped that and immediately jumped straight into a new show, with absolutely no knowledge of anything I was getting myself into besides the paragraph description the website I was using gave. Save to say it peaked my interestas, for me at least; it was the first show in god knows who long that made me go, \u201coh right, that\u2019s unique, I\u2019ve never heard of that before\u201d. Yeah, shocking I know. I instantaneously knew before even watching the first episode that I was going to review this show, so with that said:\\n\\n\r\nOtaku\u2019s, Otakette\u2019s & the young\u2019ins, I present to thee a review of Kokoro Connect or Hearts Connect in English. CUE THE MUSIC!!!\\n\\n\r\nAs per usual during first period we have History class, so get your jotters out and start taking notes!\\n\\n\r\nKokoro Connect is a 17 episode, 2012 (in Japan) anime series based on the Light Novel series of the same name with 11 volumes released between 2010 and 2013 of which only the first 4 are adapted in the anime, which, really shocked me and explains the ending. The episodes were split into one full season of 13 and then 4 specials two months later.  It is licensed by Sentai Filmworks in North America and was only released on BD/DVD in 2013 between October and December. It\u2019s lisenced in Australia by Hanabee, but for some reason Manga Entertainment in the UK hasn\u2019t (as of yet), which sucks for me as I can\u2019t buy it unless I import it, but I\u2019m not made of money. The series was produced by a relatively unknown studio called Silver Link who haven\u2019t really worked on anything majorly known; the only ones I can sort of recognise are Non Non Biyori, Strike The Blood & Baka and Test. The director is Shinya Kawatsura whose only other real known proper director role is Non Non Biyori, but he has director a couple of episodes of different shows like Durarara!! and Blue Exorcist. He does a great job in this show though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nKokoro Connect tells the extraordinary journey of the five members of the Student Cultural Research Club; Pro-wrestling fan Taichi Yaegashi, club president Iori Nagise, Queen Tsundere Himeko Inaba, nicest guy ever Yoshifumi Aoki and miss karate hotness Yui Kiriyama as they begin the series doing what they normally do, effectively breaking the ice with the viewer when suddenly, for us and them, the five start to randomly swap personalities with each other at the blink of an eye and for random periods of time. \\n\\n\r\nThis phenomenon completely takes everyone by surprise and at first they don\u2019t really understand how they should act, what it even means or what the boundaries are for what it happening, which leads to some rather funny situations like the one presented when Taichi (a teen boy) swaps with Iori (an attractive teen girl with C-cup breasts) and he starts to fiddle with her boobs, as her; because being a guy, no matter how respectable you are, the desire and temptation of boobs right at your finger-tips is just too much to bare and he proceeds as any guy would. Obviously this causes problems between the club members the more they swap bodies, when, out of nowhere, a being in possession of their teacher Mr. Goto, who calls himself Heartseed, but I call the \u201cMythical Dope King of the Whatever Maaaan\u201d. I know he\u2019s supposed to be emotionless and monotone but when he\u2019s in Mr. Goto he just looks like some doped out madman. There\u2019s actually something really weird about Heartseed, he overly polite while at the same time extremely passive-aggressive.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, back on track. Heartseed, or the Mythical Dope King of the Whatever Maaaan, explains to the group that, or rather just bluntly tells them that he is responsible for this phenomenon and will keep it going until it stops entertaining him. When asked why, he states that he finds the five of them interesting individuals and then just leaves\u2026\u2026\u2026and so we have our anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow, normally I wouldn\u2019t stand for an opening like that, labelling it as shit and just giving up with the show, but it was the idea and the situation of the body swapping that intrigued the crap out of me. I found myself, like Heartseed, extremely interested to see how these people would deal with this phenomenon and how it would strain or improve their relationships. Other situations and phenomenon\u2019s are forced on the group over time that sees them dealing with the idea of death (and the possibility of replacing said dying person), the release of their true desires, hearing what each other is really thinking and regaining ones youth (and it\u2019s memories).\\n\\n\r\n And that is where the crummy, \u201cjust deal with it, okay!\u201d opening expands and becomes such a gripping story about how far friendship truly goes, what it means to be yourself, how real are our feelings, how we change how we act in front of other people just to keep up an image so as to hide how we really feel inside and if we made and are making the right choices in life.\\n\\n\r\nLet it be known that if you proceed to watch this show, make sure to wear a helmet, because this show is constantly beating you on the head with the, \u201cBE SAD, IT\u2019LL MAKE YOU BETTER!\u201d stick, the \u201cYOU\u2019RE NOT SAD ENOUGH!\u201d hammer & the, \u201cSADNESS 3: SADNESS WITH A VENGENCE\u201d ball and chain.\\n\\n\r\nBut then again, we do get momentary respites, like during the youth phenomenon when the characters sometimes turn into children and they are just the most adorable things you\u2019ve ever seen. I usually don\u2019t react to shit like that, but I couldn\u2019t help it this time, because of how the personalities reflected their older selves.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nTaichi\\n\\n\r\nTaichi is the male lead for the show and is a \u201cSelfish Freak\u201d, which pretty much sums up Taichi completely. He is self-less to such a fault that he instantly offers up his life to save another\u2019s without thinking of how his death would affect other people, like his little sister. At the beginning of the show, he is in love with Iori and she with him. But as the phenomenon\u2019s continue and everyone\u2019s feelings develop and change, his love switches from Iori to Inaba.\\n\\n\r\nIori\\n\\n\r\nIori is the main crux for the depression the show put me in at times, even though I would describe her initial personality as bubbly, dirty & cheerful. I wish I could elaborate but I can\u2019t bring myself to spoil her backstory, it\u2019s too tragic to be felt merely by reading b&w characters on a screen. Just know that, at her age, she\u2019s been through too much and done so many things that it\u2019s comes to a point where the individual of Iori Nagise just doesn\u2019t exist anymore. But she does for the most part keep a smile on her face and soldier on, even though that may be a lie as well. Everytime I see her character on screen my stomach goes into knots and I just feel uncomfortable, but I do love her character so much, that I can\u2019t look away.\\n\\n\r\nInaba\\n\\n\r\nNow, Iori may have been the lead female at the start of the show, but Queen Tsundere Inaba steals the show in the end. I call her Queen Tsundere, because out of all the Tsundere\u2019s I\u2019ve experienced, she is the most suffocating (I haven\u2019t seen Toradora yet).Sure like all Tsundere\u2019s she comes out of her shell and gets the guy, but my god, she just chops and changes like a fucking light switch. Her Tsundere tendencies become more sarcastic later on in the show which does make it more bearable. This is just one blip, however on Inaba\u2019s personality that I can get over, because she just rocks so bad. I mean, Inaba is my favourite character in the show by a warp drive, purely based on the fact that me and her are kindred spirits, cut from the same branch, two peas in a pod, when it comes to our dealing of situations and how we keep our cards close to our chests\u2026\u2026if that chest was 50,000 leagues under the sea. You see, the two of us, simply, when it comes to making decisions, we carefully examine and consider every single possible opportunity (good and bad) that could happen. EVERY SINGLE ONE. So as to make sure that there is no danger for our friends, so that they can do whatever they want and enjoy themselves to the fullest with no problems and we can relax. And when it comes to privacy, we both have trust issues in the sense that we don\u2019t let anyone in at all and keep virtually everything a secret for fear that if we completely revealed ourselves it would change everyone\u2019s opinions of us and then hate us. Plus, we don\u2019t deem ourselves important enough to express who we are as we see ourselves as less of importance than everyone else. So, because we are one and the same, I love Inaba.\\n\\n\r\nAoki\\n\\n\r\nAoki is an interesting, yet un-interesting character as over the course of the show we practically learn absolutely nothing about him other than what we see on the surface which is that he is the nicest guy ever and he loves his friends and loves Yui with all his heart. That\u2019s it. Yep, less to say about him than Taichi.\\n\\n\r\nYui\\n\\n\r\nYui, like Iori, puts my stomach in knots every time I see her. Again I won\u2019t go into detail on, but it\u2019s bad and something that cannot accept in this world, it is something totally unforgivable and it disgusts and scares me to death. But apart from that, when Yui recovers, she is such a warm person and such a strong woman come the end. Plus she is super attractive.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the lack of cast and any big physical activities they have to do or even places they go, animation is of a minimal level. Nothing really beyond walking, standing/sitting up/down, some running, tears etc. Really simple, but smooth. Art wise though there are loads of similar looking shows out there, it\u2019s in the same vain as Another I would say most of all, or hell, even K-On! at times which means it looks good and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s good. Gradients were nice (can you sense my desperation for something to write about?)\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was done by Toshiki Kameyama and for the little I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s not special. But it does it\u2019s job of fitting in with the anime and for enhancing the emotionally drive of the given situation. Lots of slow pianos and violins, there is this one harmonica track though that I really liked so there is that.\\n\r\nThe show has 3 opening theme and four ending themes, which boggled my mind as I didn\u2019t notice because for the most part the opening animation stayed the same.\\n\\n\r\nOpening 1 is Paradigm by Eufonius and it\u2019s an okay song, nice and upbeat.\\n\r\nOpening 2 is Kimochi Signal by Sayuri Horishita and I really liked this song, great voice and the lyrics at parts really resonate with the show which was great.\\n\r\nOpening 3 is Kimi Rhythm by Masaki Imai and I really liked this song as well for it\u2019s great vocals and catchy chorus.\\n\r\nEnding 1 is Kokoro no Kara by Team Nekokan feat. Junca Amaoto and I\u2019m not too fond of it.\\n\r\nEnding 2 is Cry Out by Team Nekokan feat. Atsuko and I\u2019m really fond of this, nice voice companied with sweet acoustic guitar.\\n\r\nEnding 3 is Salvage by Team Nekokan feat. Rekka Katakiri and it\u2019s more rock oriented track that\u2019s okay.\\n\r\nEnding 4 is I Scream Chocolatl by Team Nekokan feat. Lia and it\u2019s nice quiet track.\\n\\n\r\nThe dub cast for the five leads are fantastic and performs such a varied and emotional performance in the show. It\u2019s actually one of the best dubs I\u2019ve heard.\\n\\n\r\nGreg Ayres (Koyuki in Beck & Kaoru in Ouran High School Host Club) voices Taichi.\\n\\n\r\nMonica Rial (Renge in Ouran & Shiro in Deadman Wonderland) voices Iori (also  Aki Toyosaki voices her in Japanese and I love her).\\n\\n\r\nLuci Christian (Honey senpai in Ouran & Nagisa in Clannad) voices Inaba. Shit, she voices Nagisa!? Like I need any other reason to like her.\\n\\n\r\nClint Bickham (Shizo in Kino\u2019s Journey & S\u014djir\u014d Seta in Rurouni Kenshin) voices Aoki.\\n\\n\r\nEmily Neves (Kotomi Ichinose in Clannad & Yuuki Miku in HSOTD) voices Yui.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nFor me this show is the most unique show I think I\u2019ve seen since Gurren Lagann, and that\u2019s saying something. I can\u2019t seriously think of or remember a show as unique as this. That\u2019s enough enjoyment for me, but the show is a bit heavy-handed with the depression side to it and if that kind of show is too much for you, you just will never enjoy yourself. But if depression can be classed as enjoyment then the show is bag-fulls of fun. I will definitely watch this show over and over again, because after going through such an emotionally traumatizing journey with these characters, damn-near side-by-side with them, I feel I have a deep connection with this show that goes beyond, \u201cIt\u2019s a show I really like\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nSo that\u2019s my review for Kokoro Connect. I love the show to death. I\u2019d love to give it a 9/10 personally, but as a critic and reviewer, I have to look at it critically and comparatively with the other shows I\u2019ve seen and doesn\u2019t quite reach the 8/10 on an overall technical and professional scale compared to the other shows, because I can\u2019t honestly say, as much as I would like to, that this show is better than Blood +, Clannad and The Melancholy of Haruhi fucking Suzumiya or on par with Evangelion, Darker Than Black, Another, Baccano! and Sword Art Online (wink wink, check the review).\\n\\n\r\nIf you've read this far thank you so much, I love you (totally if your female & in a not-gay way if your male), and I hope you enjoyed it and will give the show a shot. God knows what my next review is going to be, but in the meantime I'm going to try and tackle Mysterious Girlfriend X, which I am not looking forward to. \\n\\n\r\nSo, until next-time, love your anime and take care.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis world is Rotten. Rotten people should be killed off to cleanse this world. \u2013 Death Note\\n",

It\u2019s not a first time we see stories with switching bodies\u2019 storyline but the approach is definitely new. In fact, the lessons which are the results of what\u2019s the situation brings to the characters are kind of aspiring. Stories which involve life at stakes always come with a heavy drama however; I do believe the series wasn\u2019t able to achieve it. There are moments when it\u2018s really far-fetched. The problem is, setting aside the main plot, the flow of the story itself has the strong tendency of becoming really boring.\r\nThe characters arenot particularly interesting. They are not the type that leaves an impression. I believe the only interesting character is the one responsible with all the happenings in the story. After all, he\u2019s the one who LITERALLY tries to make the flow of the story interesting. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not that exciting but I like the lessons learned from the different situation that the characters have to face. Too bad, that even with a unique plot it\u2019s not really interesting.\\n",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect was disappointing, considering the premise and the first episode. The dust jacket description is that a group of five friends start suffering from personality switches and other strange phenomena, and they have to figure out how to deal with it together. The first episode includes gender swaps, boys discovering what it feels like to be a woman (thanks, Madonna), romantic hangups, and other good stuff like this. \"Exciting!\" you think. \"If the first episode starts like this, what manner of shenanigans are they going to get up to in the rest of the series?\"\r\nUnfortunately, it's all downhill from there. Within the first coupleepisodes, we find that the personality swaps are the result of a bored, supernatural entity trying to create interesting situations. Our heroes, displeased by the intrusion, respond by trying to be less interesting to this entity, for example, by trying to avoid the public when inhabiting one of their fellows' bodies. Their defenses work, and the entity is required to throw them into more and more drastic situations to get its fix.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the characters respond to their plight is surprising to me, as someone with a mild interest in filmmaking and storytelling. It's rational, but it's not interesting. Who wants to watch characters *try* to be boring? I would have expected this plot device to be used to facilitate interesting interactions between the characters. It doesn't make for very interesting television.\\n\\n\r\nAnother disappointment is that the characters utterly fail to get down to any of the shenanigans suggested by the first episode. Considering someone basically gets to second base in the first episode, with someone else's body, no less, one would have hoped to see some more interesting stuff going on. I get that this is a show aimed at teens, but come on. The extent of what we see through the rest of the series are some exceptionally chaste kisses -- and I mean chaste *for anime*.\\n\\n\r\nBut the most egregious problem with the series has to be the character of Nagase Iroi. Without going into too many details, her plight in the last five episodes of the series has to be the biggest example of first world problems I've ever seen in an anime. It got to the point where I couldn't bring myself to listen to her whining any longer and had to fast forward through large chunks of the last few episodes (I'm referring to the Michi Random episodes).\\n\\n\r\nI don't think this was a bad show. But it suffered from some serious technical issues, including how the characters respond to stress and the relatability of the problems they have. I had very high hopes from the first episode, which weren't in any way lived up to by the rest of the series.",

            "content": "*This review takes the 4 extra episodes in account as well.\r\n==========\u3010\u3010Non Spoiler Review\u3011\u3011:==========\r\nWould a person be the same person if their personality completely changes? What if you add in past memories?\r\nIs the person talking/thinking inside your head, considered to be your true self?\r\nKokoro Connect is an anime that will analyze these questions. But not necessarily give an answer to them.\r\nThis masterpiece hugely deals with human philosophy and psychology (such as Freudianism). My synopsis is a series of miraculous phenomenon that occur to the members of the Culture Research Club. These series of events will completely change their lives physically but a lot more mentally. Inthe end you will be thinking a lot in real life.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime focuses on these 4 major definition of a person or human life (as I call it): \\n\r\n\u2022 Personality (Ego) \\n\r\n\u2022 Inner Desires (Freud's Id)\\n\r\n\u2022 Past (Memories)\\n\r\n\u2022 Inner thoughts (\"True Self\")\\n\\n\r\n(Spoiler~ish warning, but does not effect your reaction to the anime)\\n\r\nThe anime takes these and twist it around in the characters finding interesting results such modifying definitions can serve as a social catalyst. That might sound confusing but if you know what catalyst mean and watch the anime you will completely understand.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the actual story and the characters. The story would blow your mind because of the results of those questions and the experiment. The characters are loveable and the anime take a huge amount of time (you can even say 100%) to develop each character. The story is really exciting and it takes a good amount of pauses to be able to sink in all the information (if you care about it). \\n\\n\r\n==========\u3010\u3010Spoiler Review:\u3011\u3011:==========\\n\r\nNote that this section is about what I understand about the series. I'll start out by listing the main questions this anime experiments with. Then I'll analyze each arc with respect to the questions. In the end I'll summarize the anime by answering each question. The answers are what I think the author was trying to say.\\n\\n\r\n\u3010Anime's Philosophical and Psychological Questions:\u3011\\n\r\nWould a person be the same person if their personality completely changes? What if you add in past memories?\\n\r\nWhat would happen if your desires take over you? Is it good or bad to follow your desires?\\n\r\nWhy does a person change over time? Does their past memories even matter to them in the present? Would you go back at any point and time to change the way you act? Should you?\\n\r\nIs the person talking/thinking inside your head, considered to be your true self?\\n\\n\r\n\u3010Arc by Arc Analysis \u3011\\n\r\n\u2022 1st Arc - Personality:\\n\r\nFrom those experiments you can easily see that Personality is not the only thing that defines a person even thought a lot of people say personality is the thing that matters the most in a person. Iori's revelations are completely amazing. She serves as the philosopher of this series asking those questions and participating in them. She fears that she cannot find her true self because of her multi-personality however Taichi told her that it doesn't matter because all those personality defines her. But...he was completely wrong...he did not know anything about the real Iori as seen in the 4th arc and finds out all those personality are not her at all. \\n\\n\r\n\u2022 4th Arc - Inner Thoughts: (will do 2nd and 3rd out of order because 1st and 4th are related):\\n\r\nIn the 4th arc, Iori becomes crazy with the idea that the voice in her head is actually she herself fearing that the voice will finally come out which it did. However she fails to realize that the voice in her head is actually her conscious rather than her subconscious which subconscious defines a person way more than your conscious (I believe). In the end the author never really answer the question that \"what aspect of a person taken out would completely change the person itself?\" The author ended it with the cliche \"a person is whoever and whatever you want to be, no matter your appearance, personality, memories, and your inner thoughts\". Even though it is a cliche it is really interesting because it gets the audience to continue thinking.\\n\\n\r\nThis arc was the most anxious one and you can Iori is stupid for panicking. However I don't believe that in the end because people actually do worry about true self and their inner thoughts.\\n\\n\r\n \u2022 2nd Arc - Inner Desires:\\n\r\nThis arc focus mainly that your inner desires (id) is dangerous without control (superego). However the main focus is actually sparking the romance between Inaban and Taichi. The members tried to avoid this experiment by avoiding eachother which of course turn out to be a bad idea. However  once they \\n\r\ncame back together in the camp trip, we see that no-superego can act as a catalyst to spark love.\\n\\n\r\nLoved this arc but there isn't a lot to give to answer the questions. Inaban x Taichi FTW!!\\n\\n\r\n \u2022 3rd Arc - Memories:\\n\r\nThis arc focuses mainly on how people changes between times and how memories can greatly define a person. Each members visits their past life in random which cause Aoki to remember his love for Nana, this causes Yui to be jealous and suspicious for his love for her. However it results in Aoki explaining \\n\r\nthat he cannot deny his past but he in the present is the actually him. After that comes Iori's incident about trying to change her past and find her true self. However in the end it results in the cliche \"You cannot and should not change the past, the present you is the actual you\". This cliche applies to Aoki's \\n\r\nincident as well.\\n\\n\r\nThis arc wasn't so much significant in answering the question too. However it is really enjoyable and we can see a whole lot of background story of each character.\\n\\n\r\n \u2022 Afterstory:\\n\r\nThis was my most favorite arc and the series did a really good job tying it up together. Inaban x Taichi was so OMG!! I'm jealous lol. Anyways Taichi and Iori conversation with eachother in the world of thoughts finally gave a conclusion. They loved eachother but never knew much about eachother. Once again \\n\\n\r\nthis anime ended with the cliche of \"if we stick together we can get through with anything\" but it was still amazing. However there is a lot of questions that we can ask about even though we felt that it was tied up greatly. But these questions are more about real life rather than the anime.\\n\\n\r\n\u3010Answer to those questions (answered by what I thought the author and anime said:\u3011\\n\r\n \u2022 Would a person be the same person if their personality completely changes? What if you add in past memories?\\n\r\nThe author did not completely answered this question. However it showed that the personality and memories aren't the only one that makes that person, themself.\\n\\n\r\n \u2022 What would happen if your desires take over you? Is it good or bad to follow your desires?\\n\r\nIt would be very dangerous however it can serve as a catalyst for goals that you are scared to achieve, therefore it is both good and bad.\\n\\n\r\n \u2022 Why does a person change over time? Does their past memories even matter to them in the present? Would you go back at any point and time to change the way you act? Should you?\\n\r\nPast experience give you knowledge not to do something again in the future. People change because they don't want to make the same mistakes. Iori wants to go back and change her ways but she realize that she shouldn't.\\n\\n\r\n \u2022 Is the person talking/thinking inside your head, considered to be your true self?\\n\r\nThis is the hardest one to put in words but easiest if you already have an answer for yourself. Your inner thoughts are suppose to be you, but it is not completely you. In the anime you can see that inner thoughts can be negative at times but it is because of their immediate reaction to what happened to them (like Iori's reaction to Inaban and Yui's treatment of her). But in the end Iori never take consideration of her subconscious that she really loves all of CRC. She is fixed on the idea that inner thoughts is 100% your true self. So the answer to this questions is no, your inner thoughts is not completely the person you actually are but they are your immediate mental reaction to what has happened to you at the time. Your subconscious should be most of your true self since it is your reaction and perspective of all of your life.\\n",

Before I address individual aspects I am going to clear something up first for true romance anime lovers. YES! THE MAIN CHARACTER DOES CHOOSE A GIRL! REJOICE! This is a great anime filled with many heartfelt and humorous moments and HIGHLY recommend that any fan of romance anime watches this as it one of the few series that is worthy of the romance genre in its description. Things will develop, so it is worth watching.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story forthis anime is very interesting and does not include the usual harem/romance struggles bs that other animes do. The characters undergo real trials and in the process develop even stronger bonds among each other. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nWhat can I say, the art is flat out amazing, I love the art style and it really brings the characters to life.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe sound is very fitting of the moods throughout this anime and it really captures the moment, but tbh, this usually isn't the type of thing that makes or breaks a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEach character has many layers of depth unlike your usual romance/harem anime. The characters have dark pasts brought up throughout the anime and they really do transform as the series goes on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis series kept me highly enjoyed, I watched it in one day and I couldn't stop myself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nOverall, this romance anime is in fact one of the ones worth watching. Love blossoms, struggles strengthen bonds, and the unique trials in this series really do help the romantic development.",

            "content": "I gotta be honest here..This anime completely surprised me. The synopsis piqued my interest but my expectations weren't through the roof. So what happens when you take an overused and cliche \"friendship\" theme and execute it properly? Well, you get this.. \r\n(There will be SPOILERS in my review)\r\n(This review will contain episode 14-17)\r\n[Story]: (7/10) (SPOILERS) \r\nThe five members of the Cultural Research Club encounter a bizzare phenomenon one day when Aoki and Yui switch bodies without warning. The same begins to happen to the other club members, throwing their daily lives into disarray. \r\nNow this is what you call a legit \"Power of Friendship\" thatovercomes obstacles and at the same time building and making said friendship even stronger. Not like that \"Fairy Tail\" bullsh*t where the power of friendship literally trumps everything because of..............\"Friendship\".  \\n\\n\r\nThe story of this show is fairly simple and nothing too complicated. A mysterious entity called \"Heartseed\" decided to mess with the members of the Cultural Research Club members by switching their bodies around at random times. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only who thought that the \"Body switching\" phenomena was going to last for the entire show. The Body switching arc is basically just a set-up and only lasted for like the first half of the series. \\n\\n\r\nFrom there on, more phenomena started to occur or what I'd like to call it \"More story arcs...an excuse for character development\". Some of you are probably thinking right now that I'm bashing the show. Actually, I'm not. In another universe, I would be bashing this show right now if it wasn't done properly. However, in this universe, they executed it properly. Every time a new arc or a new phenomena occurs, the show explores the characters past, their weakness, who they really are on the inside, the dark secrets that the characters don't want to reveal and etc. I'll go more in-depth on the \"Characters\" category \\n\\n\r\nThe following story arc are as follows \"Body switching\" arc, \"Uncontrollable desires\" arc, \"Time Regression\" arc, and the arc that was part of Ep. 14-17 was \"Emotion Transmission\" arc. \\n\\n\r\nMy review for the story category wasn't that long because the show's entire focus was the character themselves and how they dealt with the phenomena that they are put in. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8/10)\\n\r\nPlease tell me I'm not the only one who thought this was an A-1 Pictures or Kyoto Animation anime at first. The character design just looks so similar to......let's say SAO or K-On. From their face to their body structure, it's similar. Maybe Silver Link and A-1 Pictures or maybe KyoAni had a collaboration? I highly doubt it. Moving on, the animation background looks....plain. It's plainly (no pun intended) obvious that the budget for the animation wasn't that high.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't really anything special. At best, they're average. The bulk of my score will come from the OP and ED theme songs. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme songs are \"Paradigm\" by eufonius, \"Kimi Rythm\" by Masaki Imai and \"Kimochi Signal\" (Blu-Ray Exclusive) by Sayuri Hiroshita. The ED theme songs are \"Kokoro no Kara\" by Team.Nekokan feat. Junca Amaoto, \"Cry out\" by Team.Nekokan feat. atsuko and \"Salvage\" by Team.Nekokan feat. Rekka Katakiri. In the OP theme songs department, I only like the 1st (BR version) and 2nd OP theme songs. The 1st OP theme song that aired on TV did not sound like an anime opening at all. It sounded like a VN OP. In other words, it just didn't fit. In the ED theme songs department, I love the first 2 ED theme songs...the first being the best. Not only did the song's instrumentals sound great, the singer's voice also sounds damn beautiful. Additionally, what made the first 2 ED theme songs even more great is the way they used it. The preview to ending transition is just so perfect. Now that's how you hype the viewers up for the next episode. The 3rd ED theme song just wasn't my taste so I didn't really like it.\\n\\n\r\nI watched the show in English Dub so I'll be reviewing the English VA's. In my opinion, their performances were pretty decent. There wasn't anything wrong with their voice. The issue is 50% of the time, the Voice Actors had to read their lines slowly making some of the conversations awkward to watch. This is why I don't like Sentai Filmwork's past dubbing..Instead of adding and changing lines, they stuck with the original translation. Dubbing an original translation has never and will never work.   \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe show's weakest point, in my opinion, is the story. It's simple and it's really nothing too complicated. In turn, the show made up for it's weak storyline by having characters that are likable and developed. The character interactions are also fun to watch and worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nBy watching the first 2 episodes, you think you already know the characters. Their personalities are so blatantly obvious and cliched. Ineba is the calm \"senpai-like leader\", Taichi is that male protagonist that everyone somehow likes, Iori is that innocent kind-off annoying high school girl and etc. This is the best part ..For each phenomena, what the show did here is break down the walls that the characters build on themselves and reveal all the dark secrets that they were trying to hide. Some of these dark/minor secrets are what made them who they are are. By revealing each of the character's secrets, this causes the characters to break down in a horrible way and their friendship in a jumbled mess. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I love about the show is the character/relationship development. Every main character in the show is literally developed and I'm completely surprised since it's very rare for a 12/13 episode anime to develop 5 main characters. Each phenomena basically forces the character to develop. I guess, you could call it a \"Forced Character Development\"?. Nah, I won't use that term. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship development is just brilliant. The phenomena breaks these guy's friendship apart and it shows how these guys dealt with it. They helped each other out and proved that nothing and I mean nothing will tear their friendship apart. In fact, the phenomena just makes their friendship even stronger. \\n\\n\r\nI would have rated the show with a score of 8 but the extra episodes (Ep. 14-17) made the show even better. The character development that Iyori got and her true personality just shocked me to death..not literally. I can relate to Iyori because I was also like Iyori when I was in middle school. I had to show my fake personality just so I can fit in with my so-called friends. I hated acting like that because on the inside, I'm not an innocent nice kid. \\n\\n\r\nThe only minor flaw that I found in the show is Heartseed. He's not a bad character per say but not much is known about him. All we know about him is a he's a mysterious entity bothering the members of the Cultural Research Club for his own entertainment. That's pretty much it. Where did he (or she?) originate? Why does he/she exist in the first place, Is he really just there for his own entertainment or does he/she have bigger motives? I could go on with the list of questions. Like I said though, it's only a minor flaw and it won't affect my enjoyment for this show. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThere were some moments where the show would get boring but for the most part, I enjoyed the show. Especially the \"Michi Random\" arc. Did you know that those next episode previews increased my enjoyment rating? It was just plain torture, and I mean this in a good way, when I see those previews. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Kokoro Connect\" is one of the greatest dramatic/slife-of-life anime that I have watched. While the plot may be weak, it makes up for it by having a strong character interactions/development. Depending on how you lived your high school life or your past, you might have one or two characters that relates to you like I did. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8/10) (Before watching the \"Michi Random\" arc)\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9/10) (After watching the \"Michi Random\" arc) (True Score)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Well-done Animation\\n\r\n+Great Dramatic/Slice-of-life anime\\n\r\n+Almost perfectly executed dramatic moments\\n\r\n+Strong Character Development\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack (Plus the OP and ED theme songs)\\n\r\n+Effective use of Next Episode Previews\\n\r\n+Michi Random arc\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Weak plot\\n\r\n-Heartseed's character was not explained properly.",

            "content": "You may see the plot of this show and just assume it to be just another body swap story but this anime gave us a compelling story with great characters to go along with it. Instead of using the body swapping scenario to give the characters a chance to view the opposite sexes unmentionables, it uses this to delve into each of their psyches and find out why they act the way they do. Through out every situation secrets get revealed, relationships break and worlds crumble only to have their bonds strengthened.\r\nSTORY 10\r\nThis anime has a very engaging story, these characters are experiencing these roughsituations that are tearing apart their relationships and it keeps you on edge because when a new scenario appears you know it's going to break at least one of them down and you are nervous of whether or not they will be able to be brought back.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 10\\n\r\nAll of these characters are wonderful and you love seeing how they will react to each scenario. For the most part these characters are very grounded, many of the issues that they are keeping hidden from the others are things that many of us can relate to so we quickly grow attached. The relationships between each of these characters is amazing, they each treat each other in different ways as individuals and you love their interactions.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 8\\n\r\nAs far as an opening and ending goes I probably skipped them all but once but where the sound shines is in its voice acting. All of the voice actors (Japanese) are wonderful especially Miyuki Sawashiro, who is one of my favorite in general. The voice actors Breathe so much life into these characters, they go through so many different emotions from hysterically laughing to balling their eyes out.",

            "content": "We all want to be nice to others, be friends with others, and continue being friends with our close buddies, sometimes even at the expense of being untruthful. As humans, we have all probably hidden some parts of ourselves or put on a facade in front of others so as to maintain an even keel, because when it comes to maintaining friendship, voicing out everything in our minds may not be diplomatic at all. Kokoro Connect would probably speak to the hearts of many as it explores the psychological effects of facing the dark truths of the human heart...supernaturally, that is.\r\n[Story: 6/10]\r\nKokoro Connect is mostlyan original story, with certain elements already been used before. The show is set up from the beginning to feature some light comedy here and there with a serious tone, with a hint of dark atmosphere which will eventually become the prevalent atmosphere. The plot premise is not complex but the story is, featuring deep character developments and challenging psychological elements. There are many intense moments and some fairly tearjerking moments, and all is handled well due to the good direction, save for some mediocrity that I will mention later. The story tries to be logical by including some expository elements, however in some cases they may actually raise more questions than actually addressing lingering ones. There are also times where logic is abandoned for the sake of plot progression (aka plot devices/plot conveniences), which may do more damage to the story and characters than it seems, but it is all eventually debatable. This is a show that requires the thinking caps, not for solving mysteries but for understanding the human condition, and also for making out the logic in certain scenes when it seems obscure. There is romance in the story, and while it does become a major element during certain parts, it is still not the main element of the story. The story is told in arcs, with each arc presenting a different obstacle for the group of five to overcome. The story flow is natural and the pacing is great, and the overall tone of the show is quite consistent.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc of the story is great and does not have many problems. It is well directed and well handled, showing promise for the rest of the series. However, the story begins its sudden downfall from the second arc onward. The story becomes extremely contrived and predictable, with many plot conveniences and illogical moments. It can be argued that humans are not always logical, but there is a limit to how illogical a person can be, especially when the characters in the show are set up to be fairly intelligent and capable. The show does attempt to make its themes and morals clear, but at the expense of repetitive elements which may make audience go \"Yeah I get it already. Please carry on\". Yes, character development and set up is important for good pay offs, but repeating thoughts and dialogues will not get the story very far. There are also some elements that should be understandable by the characters even at face value, but as a plot device, the characters become dumb when they need to. Another element that plagues the series is melodrama. Kokoro Connect falls under the 'Drama' genre, so naturally melodrama is to be expected and that is fine. However, melodrama should be the result of a rising tension during a conversation or argument, and not a sudden or random outburst. The melodrama in Kokoro Connect happens so suddenly and uncalled for many times that it is usually unnecessary. The dramatic arguments are not built up well at times, leading to an illogical state of melodrama which might distract the audience from the storytelling into a debate of realism and logic.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is also extremely convenient and unsatisfactory. With all that intense build up and character development since the first episode, one would expect the ending to payoff well, with all the developed elements coming into play. However, that is not the case. The last arc has no true climax and it ends abruptly. Of course, this 13 episode series will then be taken further by another four episodes in 'Kokoro Connect: Michi Random', a Special which serves as an exact continuation as well as the final four episodes of the entire series, which I will review separately. With all that being said, the last half of the show can be frustrating to watch at times, but the excellent character developments and psychological elements should serve as redemption. In fact, even with all these negativity, I should have no problems giving the story a minimum rating of 7/10. But why 6/10? Because of the issue I am going to address below.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not the only show that explores the psychological patterns of people (or the human psyche as some might call it), but its supernatural twist makes it original and interesting. However, it is this very supernatural element that makes the overall moral of the story hypocritical and pretentious. The show does seem to be preaching some morals to the audience, with the repeated dialogues and all, which is great because they are meaningful and thought provoking. However, upon further analysis, one might realize either a fault in the portrayal of the message, or a double meaning in the message, or a reverse psychology in the message. Complex messages are not uncommon in the \u2018Seinen\u2019 genre (e.g. Black Lagoon, Steins;Gate), and much less uncommon in live action feature films (2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner). Some may also be familiar with the \u2018Deconstruction\u2019 genre, where the stories take a huge and dramatic twist/turn into something entirely different from what it was set up to be (e.g. Neon Genesis Evangelion, School Days). However, Kokoro Connect was not set up to be that kind of show, and it was never meant to be, or at least it never tried to be. That being said, it all depends on how the audience approach Kokoro Connect. If the audience does not read too much into the show and accept it at face value, they may leave satisfied after an incredible psychological journey. Otherwise, they may either choose to live with it or go into debate. For the non-critical viewers, forget this factor and consider my rating for the story 7/10. If not, my 6/10 is absolute. \\n\\n\r\n[Art: 7/10]\\n\r\nKokoro Connect is animated by Silver Link, and the art style is the spitting image of Kyoto Animation. All the characters in this show resemble those of K-On! and Tamako Market, from the eyes to the face shape down to the lips. Throughout the series, I could not believe that Kyoto Animation had no involvement in it. Either the animators of Silver Link are from Kyoto Animation, or they just simply copied the style. The similarities aside, Kokoro Connect does spot good animation, from body movements to background design. The body movements are fluid and realistic enough with generally nothing to nitpick about. The background designs are realistic and detailed enough, although they do not stand out. Kokoro Connect is not a visually charged show, so its level of detail in animation is good enough. The show is generally dull looking to achieve the depressing mood of the series. With that, the cinematography is excellent. Lighting is used very well to convey a character\u2019s feelings as well as the mood/atmosphere of the scene. Cheerful scenes are lighted brighter and are more colourful, while the serious or depressing scenes are lighted darker with a limited colour palette. The colours are de-saturated, making the series look generally lifeless which goes in line with the show\u2019s themes. The quality of the art is consistent throughout the series and holds up till the end. The character designs are simple and do not stand out, and each of them have their individual uniqueness that allows the audience to recognize each one easily. However, some characters resemble those from Kyoto Animation, so they may not be distinct enough to be identified as characters uniquely from Kokoro Connect. \\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 7/10]\\n\r\nThe sound design does not stand out, but it does its job effectively. Dialogue is clean and well prioritized, and no sounds drench out one another. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice work in this show is excellent. Voices are very nuanced and packed with feelings. Shift in voice tones are instantly recognizable, conveying the characters\u2019 shift in feelings and emotions. The voice cast is great and they all brought the characters to life and made them believable, especially Toyosaki Aki for the character Nagase Iori. Voice actress Toyosaki Aki is probably known best for her work in K-On! for the character Yui and also some other moe characters in other series\u2019. With that, I was a little doubtful that she would be able to pull off the depressing and melancholic voice that the show would eventually require. However, she did an exceptional job at it and it was one of the stand out points of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is effective, albeit not exactly memorable. Some recurring themes played during intense moments can be identified easily. It is the standard kind of soundtrack for any anime series, and it is nothing to cough at. \\n\\n\r\n[Character: 9/10]\\n\r\nIf all other technical aspects of the series do not live up to the hype, the character aspect would probably do. The first arc of the series is largely character driven, and then it becomes plot driven from the second arc onward. With that, the character development in the first arc is extensive. Every character is characterized excellently, from behaviour to personal issues. Most of these revelations are unfolded nicely without rush nor contrivance. Character motivations are clear from the start, and additional motivations arise as the story progresses. All character strengths and flaws are well developed and even more so as the series progresses, which will all come into play even in the second and third arc. While there are only one or two main characters, the other characters are almost as important. There is extended emphasis on the main characters, however the rest are developed sufficiently without much lacking. Each character has a different personal issue, and while the audience may not be able to relate to everyone, the character developments make their situation easy to understand. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the characters do become dumb when the series needs them to be. They start making illogical decisions and engaging in unnecessary acts, all for the sake of tension and feels. The once-intelligent characters become very questionable in terms of their decision-making and actions, and while most of these issues can be classified as \u2018conflicting human emotions\u2019, most still beg the questioning of basic logic. Nonetheless, the pros triumph over the cons. Some character irregularities may be putting off for some, but most should be able to get past the flaws and continue enjoying the thought provoking journey of self-discovery. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the excellent character developments and great scenes, the characters are still ultimately not as memorable. These characters are not original \u2013 they are cut from the same cloth from other anime series\u2019. None of these characters here have a single unique trait that has not been portrayed before, but they are some of the better portrayed ones in recent memory. That being said, the audience would probably remember the story or scenes more than the characters themselves, but they may nonetheless be delighted when reminded. \\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 7/10]\\n\r\nKokoro Connect is one of the shows that I really wanted to like and praise a lot, but I could not due to its less-than-good execution from the second arc onward. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the character developments and the psychological aspects of the show. There is good humour from time to time, and its fan service is so minimal it is not even worth mentioning. I would probably not revisit Kokoro Connect because I do not wish to go through the last half of the show again, especially its continuation Special \u2018Kokoro Connect: Michi Random\u2019.  I do not dislike the show, but I could not bring myself to like it. \\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 7/10]\\n\r\nKokoro Connect is a social commentary that explores realistic issues (despite its supernatural setting) and relatable thoughts, and it does so with efficiency and excellence. However, the series favoured the convenient way to invoke feels than to properly develop them and making them more impactful when it should have. This is a could-have-been great series plagued by occasional misfires and unfortunate lazy writings here and there. The first arc triumphs, the second arc falls, and the third arc crashes with parachutes lessening the impact. If it were not for its excellent psychological aspects, I would have rated Kokoro Connect a 6/10. Kokoro Connect is ultimately not a show to avoid or even reject, as it still works as a great thought provoking series that has many things to go for. I cannot say for sure that it has more to like than to dislike, but it is still a worthy watch and a worthy experience.",

            "content": "I enjoyed the show but there are many flaws, the biggest of which are the spontaneousness to how characters change on a whim depending on the episode. I will explain this at the end of my review.\r\nStory (9, great): I liked the story. The plot is nicely paced, with cool little supernatural mechanics that mess with the characters to facilitate their growth/youth and the mechanics tie well to how they are used to help these characters grow and come of age (I'd use an example of said mechanics, but MAL wants no spoilers in reviews!) These mechanics also create mini archs in the story whichgives it a bit of structure.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6, fair): Nothing bad to say, nothing good to say. It gets the job done. I did not notice any particularly stellar directing in terms of camera angle nor other techniques that titles such as, oh i don't know just going to randomly list off my head, Madoka, Psycho-path, Evangelion, Kill La Kill or even Your Lie in April had. \\n\r\nCamera angles are very bland, sort of just a \"here, look at our characters while they do stuff\" approach. Art style is crisp and clean, but not unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6, fair): nothing good to say, nothing bad to say. Gets the job done at a basic level. Nothing stellar (unfortunately i have based this without hearing the OP simply because i just auto skip openings, but a 6 = fair, and i think it was fairly good).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (3, poor):\\n\r\nI REALLY see potential in these characters, but i truthfully believe characters could have been handled much better in this case. \\n\\n\r\n1. At first, it seemed like the show might enter a section by section basis of tacking character's trauma or problems to help them move on or grow up, come of age, etc.\\n\r\nHowever, it ends up devolving into a mess. The show would jump from engaging in one character's issue to another character's issue on a whim just when the first painted issue/story has grabbed your attention (for ex. the episode that tackled both Iori's personal issue + Inaba's trust issues).\\n\r\n2. Characters contradict themselves too much. Or rather, it almost seems like they forget the growing / learning / character development that had occurred in certain previous episodes. I'm not sure how i can give an example without spoiling so i'll just describe the situations with no story context. For example, Character A had an arch that is dedicated to making them develop and grow in a way that teaches them to rely on others, such as friends, yet later on in the show, they completely forget about this and go back to burdening everything on themselves (which seems to be a huge reoccuring theme. Essentially im guessing the show is trying to teach teenagers to value communication, etc, all that jazz, you know the drill).\\n\r\n3. Characters are incredibly 1 dimensional,  but i don't think this is neccessarily a flaw for the objective in this show. The show clearly targets teenage viewers with themes focused on coming of age. I think using stereotypes can be an effective way to deliver some of the lessons the show tries to teach. Nonthelesss, i do have to point out that the characters are very 1 dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a pro to this lack of structure and messy approach. That it is realistic. BUT, this is a TV medium/show...sacrificing realism for delivery matters much more. Especially since this show is filled with coming of age life lessons that they want to teach to the likely teenager viewers watching it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6.5, fair - good): Overall i still enjoyed the show. It reminds me of the innocence before adulthood and the plot progression was paced decently with intriquing story mechanics. Art and sound are passable and gets the job done. Character again is my biggest complaint. It is inconsistent. Some episodes have very nice character developments, other episodes slaps a \"character development complete\" within matter of minutes. And again, it seems like the characterse all have short memeories... But in another way, while i think this is a flaw on a literary level as a media medium, it does remind me of my teenager years. Realistically, character development does not happen in a structured arch like i propsed (although i still stand that its better do structure it in a TV show), and realistically, teenagers are pretty incoherent half the time and often rebounds. So i can see these characters being more real, but again, for a TV show, doing so distracts the life lessons the narrative is trying to teach in some moments. Real life is real life, a show is a show at the end of the day.\\n\r\nTo conclude: good story and plot at a high level, bland characters, fair art and sound, bad / almost random feeling execution. To me the supernatural and story elements really carried my enjoyment. Otherwise this would be lower than a 5 rating.",

I am very saddened that the rest of the series was not animated but I guess it cant be helped, this series is pretty old and the arent going to come back to it anytime soon. i would not mind reading the rest of the light novel so i could know the actual ending but there is no FULL translation that i could find anywhere, everything only went up to volume 6, while there is a manga im sure it doesnt go as far as the novel. anyway back to the actual anime. like i said the ending was not the best ending but the anime its self was absolutely amazing. no joke this is my new favorite anime. the character interactions were perfect, the animation was on point and everything seemed to flow well while the phenomenons were happening i could feel the characters emotions with me and it really was an experience to watch this. i dont regret a single moment i spent on this anime. overall i would give it a 9/10 i would bumb it to a 10 if the rest of the series was animated but sadly its not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall definitely worth your time, at least in my opinion.",

The humour was great and the drama side sucks you in and keeps you right where it wants you. If it went along the route, it could do really well as a thriller with the suspense that builds in some of thesituations. \\n\r\nThe romance is decent but can be a little frustrating, but obviously that kind of thing goes on personal preference, so if you enjoy love triangles I'm sure you'll be into the romance that's involved. \\n\\n\r\nWith so many different genres that mesh well together and result in something great, it's hard to review aiming towards what other people might enjoy because not everybody has similar taste. \\n\r\nIf you love unique stories, then this is something you should definitely try.",

            "content": "This is perhaps not so much a review as an effort to point out that I found the plot summaries and synopses, both here on MAL and on other sources, to be misleading in one respect. Even the description on the DVD/Blu-Ray case is guilty. The problem here is that these sources implied that the body-swapping phenomenon is a pervading theme throughout the series, which isn't really the case.\r\nThe story revolves around the five students who form the Student Cultural Society, and the mysterious entity Heartseed. That much is accurate. Heartseed subjects the five of them to various phenomena that either place them in difficultsituations that they have to figure out how to deal with, or forcibly exposes thoughts and emotions to others in the group (and sometimes outsiders) that people normally rely on being able to keep to themselves. The first such phenomenon is the aforementioned body-swapping, which represents the first story arc and runs for five episodes, but then never happens again. The remaining eight episodes have two more story arcs, each involving a different phenomenon they have to figure out how to deal with, and a fourth is addressed in the four-episode OVA, \"Kokoro Connect: Michi Random\", but no more body swapping (at least in the anime; I can't speak for the additional volumes in the light novel series these are based on).\\n\\n\r\nSince I'm here, some actual review content. Technically and artistically, the series is above average. The English voice acting was all well done. The series is very much a personal, emotional drama, so judge for yourself whether that's to your taste. There were times when I thought the characters' behavior and emotions went over the top and got overly melodramatic, but on the whole it's hard to imagine how well I'd handle the situations they were in, especially considering at least some of the StuCS members came in with emotional baggage and past experiences that added complexity. Finally, there were a couple of significant story elements that were never adequately resolved.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my mis-impression about the body swapping, I don't think a problem with the summary descriptions should be counted against the anime itself. I was hooked on the characters enough to be drawn along for the rest of the ride. Definitely recommended.",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect, when it first came out, was a hell lot of fun and had a lot of potential. But that's before, you know, that entire scandal happened and seriously hurt the anime's publicity. With all honestly, before that happened Kokoro could've been amazing but they copped out. Ravaged with Inaba fanservice and stupidity, Kokoro Connect never did live up to its potential, which was showcased when it piqued around episode 6.\r\nAlright, let me explain myself.\r\nSTORY: 5/10\r\nI'll tackle the seemingly unfinished story first. The way things were built up in the first half of the season, it seemed like the production staff was aiming forthis to be a 2-cour anime. The way they played with and introduced Heartseed was quirky and mildly entertaining; an average antagonist with no strings attached. The entirety of plot was based off the group's struggle with Heartseed's ploy, but quickly turned out to be a trainwreck of \"teenage romance and angst\". In other words, they sold out. Heartseed him/herself was washed away quite easily at the end of the series. If you ever do choose to watch Kokoro Connect with a critical eye, you will know how disappointing the resolved conflict truly is.\\n\r\n_______\\n\\n\r\nART: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is generic moe. It does, however, have some pretty atmospheric scenery stills. The art doesn't only come through as the paint on the picture, as is most of the case in anime. The ambiance and solemnity of some locations during a given arc are well fitting and pretty. That's all I really have to say.\\n\r\n_______\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only sensible person is Iori, and she is the most insufferable character in the cast. Taichi is a self proclaimed Mary-Sue and white knight who is relatively bland and unappealing once you pass the \"bridge\" arc of the anime. Inaba starts out stoic and charming but becomes bait for fanservice in order to make up for a lacking plot. She literally cannot stop making the situation any worse in the anime and Iori calls her shit out more than once.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two of the main cast, Yoshifumi and Yui, are a useless tool and generic character with a preventable tragic past, respectively. I feel you should watch the anime to better understand these characters without spoilers, but they're still forgettable nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, this anime had a better first half. Until episode 6, the character interactions when swimmingly and things were going to go well with the direction of the story. But since the only driving forces of rationality were in a hesitant main character and an edgy female teenager, the plot along with the direction of character development, fumbled and burned. The product is something someone relatively new to anime can consume rather easily, but nothing special and maybe even irritating to a more diverse viewer who has seen the same thing in nearly 10 or so other anime. \\n\\n\r\nBut an honourable mention does go to Iori's backstory. I think, amidst all of that, hers was thoughtfully written and offered an explanation to who she was. But who Iori is, you'll just have to watch to find out. (hint: Identity crisis)\\n\r\n_______\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is ambient and compliments the art. My words can't do it justice so just go on YouTube and search the soundtrack up. It's quite nice and one of the few aspects of Kokoro Connect that I'll look fondly on.\\n\r\n________\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was fun, and I think I can safely speak for a good chunk of the viewers that we only watched the rest so we can say that we finished it. I'm being rather harsh, but it really isn't anything that jumps out unless this is your go-to genre. Even then, it's somewhat shallow and lacking and there are plenty of other anime that do it better than Kokoro. \\n\r\n________\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't great, but it wasn't too bad. I did like watching it, but for probably all the wrong reasons. Watching Iori snap at Inaba is a pretty entertaining if you ask me.\\n",

            "content": "This review does not contain spoilers but if it was absolutely necessary to write a spoiler, I will warn you in time.\r\nNOTE: This review takes into account the Michi Random episodes (the final 4 episodes to Kokoro Connect).\r\nDo you know the expression \"if you were in that person's shoe...?\" Well, this anime literally puts you into that person's shoe. \r\nI really liked the concept of your soul being in someone's body but you also retain some of their memories/feelings as well. This concept can either be disastrous and turn out absolutely awkward or can feel very fresh to a viewer. I would definitely say KokoroConnect does the latter. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, the story is very fresh. In essence, we have this small group of high school students in a club and one day, they realize that their souls are being swapped among each other. They discover that it is a man named Heartseed who is doing controlling them. The anime details our 5 main characters' journey in Heartseed and at the same time, discover more about their friends. I believe that the anime wants us to ask ourselves: \"Do we really understand our friends?\" Throughout the story, I believe this is the question that our main characters are trying to answer as well. \\n\r\nThere were definitely a lot of cliffhangers at the end of each episode so I found myself watching many episodes back-to-back.\\n\r\nThe ending to the anime was also really well done. I don't wish to spoil anything but I felt the last few scenes were beautifully written and pretty rare to see in the romantic genre.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI felt there was nothing too spectacular in the art department. I really liked the vibrant colours. They gave a lighthearted touch to an anime that occasionally asked deep psychological questions. Further, I really liked how the colours and framing would change when Heartseed appeared in the scene. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe first opening music was alright. The soft opening captured the slice-of-life aspect of the anime but I felt that the anime was more than that. That's why I felt the more upbeat second opening accurately portrayed the essence of the anime. The melody of the second opening suggested that the characters were going on a journey of some sort, which is indeed what our 5 main characters are doing. However, it may have been a too vibrant as Kokoro Connect does have some dark aspects to it.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to the anime is a typical soundtrack. The only standout moment was when Heartseed appeared in the scene and you could really feel the tension building in the scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEach character in this anime has their own story. And you can relate to each character. Essentially, each character embodies a certain personality type that you can relate to. Personally, I relate to Taichi for his selfless attitude. He always seeks to understand others first and be there for each of his friends.\\n\r\nThe anime does a good job of introducing each character of the anime quickly at the beginning so we have a rough idea about each one. However, by the end, we don't get an equal treatment for each one, especially Aoki. \\n\r\nI'll let my bias flow through and say that Inaba is my favourite character. She is our \"ice cold beauty.\" \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI read some comments that some people really want a Heartseed in their life. I can see why as Heartseed brings out the true nature of each our main characters by creating situations where each of them can honestly express themselves. While this anime is not a masterpiece, it was definitely enjoyable and ranks pretty high on my romantic/slice-of-life anime list. \\n\r\nI would definitely recommend Kokoro Connect to anyone who is looking for a fresh take on the romantic genre.\\n",

            "content": "So you would think this is one of those biased reviews where I randomly put 10's just because I love the anime. It's not true, because I actually think all of those fields deserve 10's.\r\nJust by looking at some pictures of Kokoro Connect, you would think it's one of those anime where there's different routes, and it's basically just a story about a group of friends with problems. In this anime, it's different. There's an actual plot and conflict in the anime. \r\nStory-The story is perfect for a slice of life anime. All these mysterious things keep happening that's bringing the friends apart. The charactersconflict, fight, go through hard times, and eventually become closer. It makes you think, \"Is Heartseed doing this to make them closer\"? And you will never predict what events come next. From Heartseed trying to kill Iori, to Yui beating up a guy at a train station. It's unpredictable, with very touching scenes about friendship and love. Also, it does a good introduction  at the beginning of the characters and the problem that's going on, so the watcher can understand what's going on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt-While watching, I noticed that the art looks exactly like the art from K-ON! and Kyoukai no Kanata. This art style really fits the anime, and the characters are drawn well. They all look like average high-schoolers, instead of one of those anime where one character has beautiful blue hair, and this other character is some rich blonde hair girl-they look normal, which makes the anime more natural. Even though it's the same art style as K-ON!, the characters from Kokoro Connect don't look like the characters from K-ON all that much, so they did a good job of making them look unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The opening matches the anime well. It sounds like an average opening for any  romance or slice of life anime, but that's what makes it perfect. Kokoro Connect IS an average-looking anime, and it IS romance and slice of life. Now to the voice acting. It wasn't anything special, but it wasnt that bad either. Inaba's mature voice matched her tsundere-character. Iori's immature voice matches her hyper personality. It's hard to describe Yui's voice, but it did match. Aoki and Taichi's voice matched perfectly. They sounded like average high schoolers. During the touching parts of the anime, the soothing background music really matched the mood, and adds on to the addiction people get while watching it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-The characters were amazing. You really get to develop a love for they're unique personalities. They all have they're own stories and problems. In most anime, when two girls like the same guy-you mostly vote for the first girl, and get annoyed by the second. But in this anime, the two girls (being Iori and Himeko) cannot be dislikable. Instead of going route to route like most of Key's work, all the character's stories and problems develop together, and they make it work. It's one of those anime where there's a lot of really different characters and it's extremely hard to choose a favorite.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-I really enjoyed this anime. I finished it all in one day. It was really addicting, because you always wonder what's gonna happen next. What're they gonna do about it? Is it going to be okay? Is Iori really going to die? Will they still remain friends? The way everything goes together gets you really addicted, and I admit I cried a lot on the feels episodes. It's really good, and I really recommend it!\\n\\n\r\nOverall-Almost everything about it is perfect, basically. If you like touching anime with unique characters and tons of plot twists and an amazing friendship, this is the anime for you!",

Having a blend of supernatural elements in a normal everyday life was done uniquely and interesting, and that's why I rated this show so high.\r\nThe story is about five friends just living your typical high school life until the antagonist Heartseed appears to intervene in their life of stability. Their friendships are put to the test as their thoughts, actions, and even their bodies are no longer in their control as Heartseed manipulates them for entertainment. This story instantly pulled me in becauseI've never seen anything like it before and the story unfolded nicely episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the visuals looked good and although the soundtracks played throughout the show weren't all that worthy of remembering, i enjoyed the opening theme song as well as the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were done well in the show as they were portrayed as being real-life people. The characters in the showed genuine  emotion and all of them developed in just 13 episodes by the end of Kokoro Connect, and again in just 13 episodes i felt attached to the characters at the end.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I judge a show by the originality of the story, the characters of the show, and the impact it leaves on me after I've finished it, and Kokoro Connect didn't not disappoint in any category and is a must watch especially if you enjoy the Slice of life genre.\\n",

The character interaction and seriousness throughout the series is fucking phenomenal. I feel like I connected with all the characters at some point and understood what they were going through. It seems like it would start off pretty slow like any other slice of life anime, but it goes 0-100 real quick with how they get into the characters flaws and concerns and inner deep thoughts. It's honestly my favorite part of this series and why I fuckinglove it so much. (keeping this short and sweet)",

Also [Minor spoiler] the ending conflict with those 3 guys seemed like too much of an ex-machina solution to bringing them together.\r\nArt: 7\r\nIf judging this anime for quality instead of originality then it's pretty standard and clean.

This anime really show what you would call 'true' friendship. Feel so stupid that i didn't watch this anime sooner. Shit!\r\nThe art, for me the chara designs is just normal. Every parts of the charas are normal for me. But that's what made me so impressed by this anime. This anime prove that \"don't judge animes by its chara means\" ! =P\r\nThe sound, this anime also don't have too flashy BGM, mostly there aren't any BGM that fit with the situations. But Irecommend for you all to check the first OP (Paradigm), this OP really suits the anime plot i think (if you check the english translation, you'll know what i mean). You may also check the first ED (Kokoro Na Kara), it's refreshing for those who love mellow-style music.\\n\r\nThe characters, for the character's personality. I think all of them are personalities which you'll find in most of the animes. A man of virtue with a god level of righteousness, a determined mind pervert, a cheerful with hidden problems heroine, clumsy with a cute reaction, and a cool beauty with cold heart when you irritate her. I think most of you must see them many times.\\n\r\nThe story, this what made this anime so wonderful. The story is strong enough to make you forget the flawed parts of this anime. You'll find the beautifulness of friendship. You'll see how complicated their problems is enough to make your mind invaded when you sleep (khekhekhe). What's more? The writer have so brilliant idea to amuse us, i think he want to show us how beautiful friendships can be if you do the things right when you clashing with your friends (i think that is the moral message).\\n\r\nAnd the writer didn't used boring way to have it delivered to us. It's make me curious how he managed to think about these strange phenomenons. And all of that phenomenons are just for one goal : to test the bonds of friendship the CRC members have.\\n\r\nI don't know why whenever they success to endure the test they given, i want to scream \"oh yeahhh\" spontaneously. Well sorry for exaggerating, what i try to say is this anime story plot is strong enough to drive your emotion i think.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime for those who love school-life, supernatural\\n\r\nThis anime's triangle-love parts really have unexpected ending.\\n\r\nThe school-life parts are also good and fit the 'test their bonds' title.\\n\r\nThe phenomenons very unique too. Phenomenon where your desires unleashed uncontrollable? This anime rocks!!!",

They go through puberty together by swapping bodies and engaging in entangling relationships.

            "content": "Kokoro connect can and most likely will have a profound affect on many people. Kokoro literally means Heart; Mind; Mentality; Emotions; and Feeling. The connection of all those personal things being shared between 5 friends. All of this leading to them to either becoming closer to each other or losing faith in them.\r\n     The story is something of a hit and miss with me. The Story is very slow paced, each arc lasting 4 to 5 episodes. With each ending of an arc having lasting affects on a future one. Swapping bodies, Uncontrollable Impulses, Age regression, and finally Telepathy of innerfeelings. Each of these being a Catalyst for a specific characters story arc. The reason for my Hit and miss comment is that they didn't delve nearly deep enough into Taichi's psyche. I had to go back after i finished to remember why he feel like an Outcast. Overall though the story will make you remember, people will always have more than one side to them regardless how close you may be to them.\\n\\n\r\nAt the start of Kokoro I thought the Art was terribly sloppy for the 1st arc. But I was glad i stuck with it because it either grew on me, or perhaps is was that it matched the more comical side of body swapping, or maybe it just got better. I don't know. The characters aren't exactly eye catching either. Though I think it's better this way, just for fact that the characters have such colorful personalities, if they were drawn an any other way it would of taken something from that.\\n\\n\r\n     Kudos to the Japanese cast, there wasn't a single time in the whole show where i would do anything different. Double Kudos to you Heartseed you creeped me the hell out every time you spoke. The BGM isn't anything thing to sneeze at either, during some of the more intense scenes it worked really well.\\n\\n\r\n     Finally to the Character god i wish i could make this an 11. Each character is so well fleshed out that its almost criminal. The only person you don't really get to know is Heartseed but hes played so well it's forgivable. Whether a Character is so scared to the point of hiding herself in there room because she can't control themselves or someone so stressed out with worry they get sick, it's all shown to great affect. It's hard to hate any of the characters for to long just for the fact that Heartseed has such a hold on them you can almost feel the stress you would go through if you had to deal with it. I guess an a way I would of liked Taichi to be a little bit more broken. Just for the fact that everyone else has so much going on, he seems kind of out of place.\\n\\n\r\n     Besides the slight issues with me getting into the show due to the art, this will always stick with me where ever i go. I will most likely be getting this on DVD in the future and read some of the Light novels just because i want to spend a little more time with these characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes to Watch, Yes to Rewatch, and Yes to supporting it creator.",

            "content": "So, where do I begin?\r\nThis show is definitely one of my favorites and so this is the first one I ever wrote a review on. So let's get right into it. This will include the 4 special episodes.\r\nStory - 10\r\nCompared to a lot of slice of life animes that I've watched, especially comic ones, they don't really have a continuos story, but rather have little parts that happen in the character's life every few days or months.\r\nIn Kokoro Connect, the story is ongoing for the most part, and is continuos until there's another part (3 parts in total, including the 4 \"sequels\". The way thatthe events in this series develop the personalities and expose other sides of the characters is fantastic in my opinion and the creators of this anime did really well with it, it touched my, and many others' hearts in the right spot I would say. The fact that everything focuses on the main story, rather than side events is pretty good as well.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion: Story development was pretty much on point as I see it, it was clear and didn't have too many side stories if at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe art was very enjoyable and fitting, but it was definitely nothing special.\\n\r\nThe art was not outstanding or unique in any way, and the characters looked a little generic, yet they still had the distinction from other characters in other series and would be recognizable for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion: nothing unique, wasn't dissapointing.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nAgain, as the art, nothing too special, but the music and sounds were very fitting for the anime, it isn't something that makes the anime itself distinct though.\\n\r\nin conclusion: it's short, just read it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nThere are animes in which I love the characters, but not the story as much (that happens if you watch mekakucity actors without actually looking out for the rest of the kagepro parts), but in this series, the characters were just pipes for the situation and not characters that I'd think of in that kind of situation. But the development of how you discover more parts about their personalities and feelings was made very well and can be moving for people relating to the story.\\n\\n\r\nin conclusion: Character development was better than the characters themselves in my opinion, but you might like them after all, they are relatable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nThe anime really moved me when I watched it and made me cry at some point. It touches really sensitive subjects for me, yet do it in such a way I was relieved. As I said, definitely one of my favorite animes.\\n\r\nI'm sure every Slice of Life fan will like this one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\nIt overcomes all of it's flaws at the end, because it's an enjoyable and moving series. Have fun watching it :)",

Wrestling fanboy.\\n\\n\r\n2) Himeko Inaba - The strong silent type who really comes forward as the leader of the whole pack .\\n\\n\r\n3) Iyori - A happy go lucky person, who can make just about anyone smile\\n\\n\r\n4) Yui - She's the brawns of this gang . A black belt and skilled fighter with a soft core.\\n\\n\r\n5) Aoki - The Ron Weasley of the group .\\n\\n\r\n~SLICE OF LIFE TAG~ 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was really popular. But that success wasnt down to the cutesy stuff or the dark undertones or even the sexually driven scenes. It was more to do with its Slice of Life tag . \\n\\n\r\nOn the surface , the story is mainly driven by the various trials the MCs face. The way they deal with each is unique and entertaining to watch . But the real reason i give so much plaudits to the writers is the excellent story writing. Before you read further, just look above at the description i've given for each of the 5. Their challenges all involve facing off against who they are . Each and every one of these challenges brings the MCs to their knees and face bitter truths about their life. \\n\\n\r\nOfcourse these can all be easily missed by most people and be mistaken as just some dark undertones. But look carefully at each of these episodes and you'll see an amazing message hidden in them . The story you may forget over years , but that simple message may probably stay with you for life . Which of the 5 characters you associate with is something you'll have to find out for your own. Once you do , its upto you to discover how that particular message is relevant to you. That is why i personally believe that this anime succeeded so much - because it embraced the slice of life tag better than any other anime I've yet watched (i.e anime that really had any sort of relevance in the real world) . \\n\\n\r\nThat being said , its pretty obvious how well the characters were developed (10/10 for that). \\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~ 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOne can tell an amazing story via anime . But the anime will not become great if it does not have BGM to back it up .. to hit you right in the feels when it matters ( A fact excellently elicited by FMA and FMA Brotherhood -Slightly varied stories yet much different ratings on MAF) . \\n\\n\r\nTogether with a great opening and ending songs, Kokoro Connect has an amazing BGM to make every emotion transmitted to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\n~ARTSTYLE~ 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOne word - BEAUTIFUL\\n\\n\r\n~FINAL VERDICT~ 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the anime invokes the mind to rethink our lives, it does have some flaws. Well i cant really call them flaws, but things that left me disappointed.  For one thing , i can hear the unanimous voice of the fandom for a second season, one which we never got. The manga does have a few volumes after the events of this anime, but it never got a second season. Secondly , a lot of things about HeartSeed were told very vaguely . Going by the trend set by other anime such as Noragami , this could have been a plot device to milk out a second season, or even a reboot with entirely new set of characters. But to this day we have not gotten a second season. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for just a fun time , probably you will be better served elsewhere. But if you do have the patience to actually listen to the message that is being provided via this story , then you wont be disappointed",

            "content": "When I first went into Kokoro Connect, I thought that it's premise was very similar to Yamada-Kun to 7-nin no Majo with a bit more drama and seriousness. It had a bit of melodrama which isn't really my taste but it was still something that was enjoyable to watch.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nIn the beginning, it was the usual switching bodies ordeal, which although is done many times is still entertaining for me to watch.  I really liked their take on all the phenomenons and their realistic effects on people's lives.  The comedy is also pretty funny to me with the few awkward situations that occur.They blended the seriousness and comedic parts of the show together perfectly while still being effective at doing both.  The pacing was to my liking, with something important happening in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art style of this show isn't really anything special, it looks like the run of the mill anime art style but it was still very clean.  The drawings of the characters look good and fit their personalities very well.  It was put together very nicely but it didn't really stand out to me.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe soundtracks fit well with the story but not much of it was memorable although the EDs were pretty good.  The song that changes the mood when Heartseed enters was also good.  As for the voice acting, it was very well done especially Inaba's. (Really liked her voice acting for Mordred and Canaan)  Emotions were very well portrayed but I still can't get over characters that are crying.  I think that's just a me thing though because all I wonder about is how the voice actor's face looks like when they are acting out the scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe five characters were the highlight of this show with every one of them being flushed out with very real pasts and flaws.  I really like their super tightly knit friendship and how they try to understand each other, defining how friendships are suppose to be.  You can see them developing so well together, with everyone helping one another to solve their personal issues as well as becoming more and more dear to each other. Their ways of going about their lives and working together to solve each others problems were well thought out.  The only character I had problems with was Heartseed which I didn't really see having much of a purpose in the story.  I didn't really see any development in Heartseed either, which is why I didn't really like it, but the way they introduced it with the changing mood and atmosphere was notable.  However, all the other characters were excellent.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nAt first, this anime wasn't really enjoyable because it was a bit melodramatic but if you can get used to that then this anime is pretty entertaining to watch.  Some things were predictable but the character interactions is what kept me intrigued with this show.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nWould recommend to anyone who likes drama, romance and comedy.",

I am not saying that this is bad anime...\r\n**Lets say that the \"philosophical problems\" are here for more than just as fundamental plot device for good story...**\r\nAs anime (story, characters, visuals ...), I love this piece. But, big aspect of it are the (aforementioned) philosophical \"somethings\". The questions may be thought provoking, but I think that they were pointless (many of these question cant be answered in other way than by speculations, and you just have to choose answer that you somewhat like...), and answers were developed very poorly(kinda \"do what makes youhappy\") ... which made story less enjoyable, because there were developed through story ... Do not get me wrong, the story was unique and entertaining to watch, but when some of the main protagonist tried to solve for himself one(most) of those questions, it kinda felt like he could as well just ask himself if he wants to be asshole or good person, and after choosing one of those he could just decide on further development by tossing coin...\\n\\n\r\n**Now let's assume that all the philosophical thing were there just for story and not for you to think about them... **\\n\r\nThis assumption just sound silly and I can't acknowledge that this maybe the intent of creators....\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, many times while watching this, I caught myself really enjoying how easy to watch and beautifully made this anime is.

OR maybe I'm just overthinking it...",

            "content": "A fun romance show centered around sci-fi elements. Kokoro Connect starts off strong with an interesting group of friends randomly swapping bodies with each other for a short amount of time. This leads them to learn very personal things about each other, which really strains their relationships but at the same time draws them all closer together.\r\nOk, I really liked this show and thought the sci-fi elements were cool at first but now I'm going to get into slight spoilers. \r\nSo, the whole body swapping thing is really cool, but that's not the only sci-fi element in the show. Throughout the series, new sci-fi elementskeep getting added. And each new one is substantially less interesting than the last. With that being said, the last 3 or 4 episodes are nearly ruined by the final sci-fi element that gets introduced.\\n\\n\r\nAll the sci-fi stuff had purpose at the beginning of the series, it drew the cast of main characters closer together and forced them to help each other out with their darkest problems. By the end of the series, it just became a nuisance and I found myself wishing I could just enjoy the characters natural development together in a regular way. I really don't want to spoil what these added sci-fi elements are but just be warned, they get progressively more random and annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Kokoro Connect is still a really unique show. Romance mixed with crazy sci-fi stuff in a seemingly normal slice-of-life world. I really enjoyed the first 75% of the season, but the ending really left something to be desired. I'd still recommend this to anyone looking for a unique romance show though. Anyway, thanks for reading! 7/10",

            "content": "With anime like these, it makes me wonder exactly where the authors got their ideas, because this one is definitely something special.\r\nKokoro Connect is about a few high school students with some very peculiar problems, ranging from unstable teenage outbursts and well, lots and lots of drama. But the good kind of drama. You will see revelations happen as the plot and characters unfold to reveal something pretty, unique scenarios. There's a lot to say here, and so much more I could say, but I'll leave that part to you.\r\nThe characters are the real juice in this engine. They're all apart of this unique schoolclub called the: Student Cultural Society, or in short, StuCS; which honestly we never quite figure out what the club is really all about. But everything goes downhill as we meet up with HeartSeed, who is the main culprit here. Basically, HeartSeed seems to be some sort of hive-mind type intelligence that feeds off of human emotion in response to what orders he may give them. He takes the persona of Ryuuzen, Gotou and manages to entertain himself with the students of StuCS by tampering with their lives in order to get enjoyment. This may all sound doom and gloom, but I believe his motives aren't for the worse. The students themselves are quite the bunch. Without getting too in-depth, they all seem to be dealing with their own problems, even ones that they might not have known about, and over time see the errors in their ways. They're also all very varied in their emotions, I really felt good connections with them.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the art, it was well...decent. Nothing too special, but it won't make your eyes ask for more candy. The OP and music is also quite decent, but again nothing special. As where the voice acting is superb, everything else seems to be very mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall this one is quite the journey, be prepared for a lot of drama and romance, as well as some pretty crazy scenarios. I highly recommend this anime!",

            "content": "I won't hesitate to say that \"Kokoro Connect\" is, as of this review, my all-time favorite slice-of-life anime. The premise is a well known cliche: the standard body-swapping plot device that filler writers turn to when they run out of ideas. But much in the same way that \"Kimi no Na Wa\" tells a captivating tale, \"Kokoro Connect\" uses the body-swap phenomenon to evolve the characters and their relationships. It's not just done to generate laughs (which it does). It helps to tell a story far more profound.\r\nThe music and art were fine. Nothing amazing, but still good. The characters, however, never felt to melike one-dimensional archetypes but rather genuinely fleshed out people with their own interests, hopes, and fears. Since each character retains their voice actor no matter who inhabits their body, the characters (and audience) have to determine who is whom from their speech, mannerisms, and personality, a detail I appreciated. The plot is suspenseful and fast-paced, and the comedy at times is laugh-out-loud hilarious. Overall, a solid anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then begins episode six.\\n\\n\r\nDespite exceeding my expectations in almost all areas, I sincerely began to hate this show. It's separated into three arcs, each with their own strange phenomenon occurring to these unlucky teenagers. The first is body-swapping, but I don't even remember the last two because of how convoluted and uninteresting they were. Worse yet, the next eight episodes became like a game show in which the characters constantly tried to one-up each other with their \"tragic\" backstories and \"crushing\" traumas.\\n\\n\r\nI finished the show, cringing and eye-rolling most of the way. But then I remembered how much I enjoyed the first five episodes. I believed from the generic plot summary that I was going to regret watching this. I didn't, but I easily could have. \"Kokoro Connect\" told a better story in five episodes than most anime do in twenty-five. Do yourself a favor and call it quits after the first arc.",

            "content": "I am also including the 4 episode \"sequel\" in this review. \r\nI have been meaning to watch Kokoro Connect for a little while now, actually it's been on my to watch list for years. I decided to revisit this short and sweet anime about the daily lives of a few high school misfits, whom I related to more so than I could care to admit, with a few twists along the way. \r\nHigh school animes usually diverge into two directions: the cop-out, fan service, sort of vibe, where the characters remain static and one can sit back and enjoy the nothingness and fill the voidof your empty soul with cute girls doing cute things. Or the anime can twist the formula and make it something completely unique and different. Kokoro does the latter. \\n\\n\r\nBut what many anime do is fail to fully flesh out the characters, especially if the show is not more than 24 episodes, as we see here. It's hard to make you, as an outside observer, want to know and care what happens to the characters in such a short amount of time. Kokoro connect takes the traditional anime tropes of character development and actually delves into the lives of the characters, and the secrets they harbor. \\n\\n\r\nWe all know the masks we put on for others is a fake one. You have a mask for your friends, a mask for your family, a mask for your classmates, for your coworkers, the list goes on. We switch our masks and it becomes exhausting, not quite knowing who we really are inside. On the surface interactions are pleasant, but inside we dance with our inner turmoil. So what do we have here? Turns out each character is suddenly thrust into a strange situation, wherein each learns of the other's darkest secrets. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, it has its flaws. There I think is one too many characters for each character to have a fully fleshed out role, the art is nice but a bit bland, the music is mostly unnoticeable and some of their problems are solved too easily. But overall, it was a solid watch and worth at least a cursory playthrough. \\n\\n\r\nI'm trying not to give away too many spoilers and leave it general, as I haven't reviewed an anime in years, but Kokoro connect deserves at least an 8 in my book. It is a clever, emotional, slice of life anime that concludes in a satisfactorily way. Perhaps one day my own mask shall fall...",

            "content": "This review is based on my experience of Kokoro Connect. I want to start out by saying things everybody has said before when watching an anime they dislike. Kokoro Connect tries too hard to be something special but it's just a borderline harem with a trashy mc who likes wrestling which very few anime viewers can relate to. The other side character is a useless friend of a useless mc who continuously gets cucked. The female character are pretentiously insecure and has small problems that get magnified so our mc could \"save\" them lol. \r\nStory-2: The story is nothing new, shitty mc with some shittyfemale characters all over his average dick. People switch bodies,have unstoppable desires,digress to little kids, and then randomly read other's minds. Sounds interesting if the characters had not been in a love triangle with the mc cucking his own friend. Honestly Japan this is an anime and we're not into ntr so please fuck off. Even with 17 episodes this anime feels rushed.\\n\\n\r\nArt-6: The art and animation can be enjoyed by many others but for me I hated the way the characters looked. Main character and side male character has a punch able face. Female characters could be pronounced as a copy of k-on.\\n\\n\r\nSound-4 Music is aight cuh. Always skipped the op and ending song because it's nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-2: Oh boi finally I get to the shitty characters, god damn. The characters have 0 depth and I sincerely mean 0 depth. Tachi our main character is unrelatable in the sense of wrestling and most of his hobbies. Second episode he is already exposed as a selfless person and always wants to save people, he's not selfless and his actions are really cringy. Tachi is a circle jerk character for white knights. Tachi cucks his friends in multiple occasions because he's our main character, I really wish they made it a harem so it wouldn't be so painful to watch. Inaba is our second offense, I personally liked Inaba before I realized how much of a selfish,weak, and pathetic hoe she is. Generic violent semi-tsundere who punches the mc out of anger, also calm and collected but very useless. Likes our mc because he's really nice LOL fucking kill me. Steals our mc alway from Iori who I'll get to in a moment. Could of been, great I was hyping Inaba as best girl until she fell apart. Iori is suffering an identity crisis and can't handle it anymore. At first  a hated character by viewers for how dense and annoying she is stealing our mc from supposedly best girl Inaba. We then realize how savage she really is and I fucking love her. I love Iori for how savage she, only reason I rated characters a 2. I just want to support Iori to be herself, she's fine for saying what's on her mind and her true opinions. I'm fine if she wants to filter our her words before she says it, I'm okay if she says mean shit if it's truly how she feels. I didn't like how she suffered from identity crisis all of a sudden but I'm not against, I wish she started out savage and never touched our shitty mc Taichi. We then have Aoki our cucky boi who likes this dumb insecure blonde who never really answers his feelings. The blonde never really answered anybodies feelings and just hovered our mc dick with clothes on and never sat on his laps. Iori is the best character by far, Inaba could of had it all and so could of Taichi. Taichi is despicable how generic and easy he is to predict. His heroic speeches which is in every anime and follows the rule of complimenting the female characters sucks and with 17 episodes characters feel rushed. The characters are scared of small problems except of the blonde girl who had been assaulted before some real shit tbh. Anime could of been better off not taking the serious route tbh, they can't do anything right.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-1: I made this review so the rating drops lower because honestly fuck this anime. The only good parts were fan service and memories of Inaba before she became a shitty character. My favorite scene was when Iori roasted the shit out of Inaba, I honestly wished Iori roasted the shit out of Taichi too. I want to go into this anime and expose all of these dense fucking characters. Can't heartseed make them all kill themself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-2: Kokoro connect sucks, not much to it. If you watch it and realize how dumb their problems are and how many times this sort of mc's personality has been replicated you would understand. Aoki should not be in this anime, all he's here for is to get cucked which provides the viewer with a sense of comfortableness. DO NOT WATCH THIS ANIME IF YOU GET TRIGGERED EASILY.\\n",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect is much more than a 'slice of life' with a speck of 'supernatural'. More than that, it is a philosophical exploration of identity and the self, delving deeply into the aspects of what defines a person, a personality, an emotion, and ultimately, the true self. This exploration is undertaken amidst the background of the bonds of friendship and passion, the bittersweet pleasure and pain of love, the maniacal follies of despair and sadness, and the echoing nostalgia and melancholy of the past.\r\nOf particular strength to the the story is the implicit exploration of the concepts of \"hon'ne\" (\u672c\u97f3) and \"tatemae\" (\u5efa\u524d): the unspokenworld of true feelings and desires (hon'ne) and the often contrasting fa\u00e7ade of public behavior and opinions (tatemae). The depth to which these concepts of Japanese nature are investigated makes the story a gem for those seeking a philosophical journey inward into the most primordial and fundamental attributes of the self, and the impact of external perception on who we seem to be to others in contrast to who we believe to be ourselves.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the way, a roller-coaster of emotions will swing the viewer through joy and sorrow, assuring that one's heart will forever resonate with the implications presented in the plot. Not a show for those who cannot see past the superficial aspects of a story. Proceed into a journey that will make you inquire the very core of your existence...",

            "content": "In its entirety of 17 episodes, \"Kokoro Connect\" accomplishes what most anime cannot do in a hundred. Its drama, comedy, and romance meld together in perfect balance - and I do not use that word lightly. Plunged into schemes such as randomized body switching, five students are forced together to sink or swim, and the result is what most shows dream to be. Kokoro Connect is a must-watch!\r\nStory [9/10]: Composed of four main story arcs where the characters are forced into some supernatural occurrence, Kokoro Connect is undoubtedly contrived. Yet that is what allows it to explore its characters and relationships without squandering time tryingto build tension. It also forces the audience to ponder how he/she would handle these phenomena (similar to Death Note). The characters try to be logical and direct within their emotional bounds, creating a compelling story.\\n\\n\r\nPacing [9/10]: The pacing of Kokoro Connect is incredible! Its writers knew exactly how much could be done in the episode limit, and they filled each minute to its fullest. That is not to say that there aren't scenes which feel a bit slow or rushed, but they are a drop in the bucket. Have you ever wondered what an anime could be if its characters didn't waste half the show waffling and avoiding direct conversation? The result, as we see in Kokoro Connect, is wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nArt [7/10]: Even though there it avoids some drawing-intensive events such as large festivals, Kokoro Connect still keeps its artwork fresh with plenty of movement and changes in scenery. Its style is consistent (no chibi or blobs) and, although nothing remarkable or flashy, is enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound [6/10]: While the OST may be the weakest link in the series, this is largely because the rest of its elements are so strong. The music is akin to that in most anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [9/10]: When it comes to characters you enjoy seeing, no amount of screen-time is enough. What we do get, though, are five characters who have their own distinct, non-archetypal personalities. They develop and mature, struggle and succeed. The show is unburdened by side characters/stories, instead deciding to stay focused on these five and their relationships - and in this case, less is more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10/10]: Every episode of Kokoro Connect holds its own. It weaves all the threads of character-driven anime - developing relationships, facing past demons, finding self - into a beautiful fabric. I loved it, and would recommend it no matter what your genre preference!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: [9/10]",

            "content": "This series is absolutely phenomenal, even though it may not have the highest rating.  Majority of the overall rating comes from enjoyment in my review, cause even if the story and character is a heaping pile of shit, if the anime makes it work, i'll give them creds.  Okay so here goes..\r\nStory (8) - The story is very interesting, in that you really don't know what's gonna happen next.  The first story arc ended with a BANG and I was almost scared for a minute there.  The biggest problem I can find with the story is that it is forced alot-Balloon Vine comes, does weird phenomenon, big life changer, goes back to normal and cycle continues.  I really didn't know if the anime was supposed to be comedic or dramatic with this, and it became a pain to see the characters just go through the same thing all over again.  It also suffers from a tell-all story, in which the characters have to say what they are feeling instead of it being understood by the viewer through their actions. That being said, the body swapping and and other little moments make the anime totally worth it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8) - I really liked the art, because it wasn't extremely high quality, and a bit fuzzy, which in a way resembled the relationships between the characters- nothing's solid and nothing's established yet, they're still finding out who they are.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6) - A lot of ppl like the soundtrack, but i found it pretty mediocre.  It works occasionally but majority of the time the anime is held up by its story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8) - This anime is really split into underdeveloped characters, overdeveloped characters, and characters somewhere in between.  The UD (underdeveloped) characters would be Aoki and Yui.  The OD (overdeveloped) characters would be Taichi and Nagase.  The in between would be Inaba, which is really the sweet spot of the series.  I'll go down the list.\\n\\n\r\nAoki is the most bland character in the show.  We only get some form of development for him when he thinks that he doesn't really love Yui, which was his only defining characteristic in the first place.  We get occasional moments of his interactions with Taichi as well, but he has little to no moments with Nagase or Inaba, which probably gives him the least development.  He loves Yui unconditionally, but the anime leaves out one key component to this love, why.  In the entire series, Aoki gives no solid reason for loving Yui except that she's cute and has a nice personality - which personality?  Ultimately, gets a little better but that was from being a horrible character so not much improvement.\\n\\n\r\nYui is a pretty interesting character in the show.  The show starts off its problem solving with Yui's fear of men-which only pops up at certain times to raise suspense, its extremely inconsistent.  The reason for her fear is good (almost raped), but the anime doesn't even address that seriously, which couldve given it so much more depth.  Aoki loves her, and she loves him too, but why?  This relationship is definitely forced in the show, and there is only one major detriment to it later on.  However, Yui does have a good, developed relationship with Taichi and Nagase, which redeems her unrealistic relationship with Aoki.  However, she has little to no interaction with Inaba (which could've saved her character, explained later).\\n\\n\r\nTaichi is supposed to be the main character of the show, but that spot really should go to Inaba.  He is tagged early on as the selfless member of the group, he loves to solve people's problems.  This made me dislike him out of all the members the most.  I would've been 100% good with taichi if inaba didnt label him as the savior so early on, it wouldve been to nice to see that trait represented through his actions. It wasn't tho and as a result the show goes to far in this trait and overdevelops him by having him solve everyone's freaking problem in this show.  I never really liked his relationship with\\n\r\nNagase, they are set up by everyone in this show, but they dont click, and for some reason the show thought differently.  However, he gets better as the show goes on, and his unrealistic relationship with Nagase is resolved in the 4 episode extra arc.\\n\\n\r\nNagase is, sadly the receiver of all the horrible things in this show.  Balloon Vine manages to make her already crappy life even more like hell with each of his pranks.  Her characterization is one of the most sad yet beautiful things in the show, we learn that she still doesn't even know who she is yet cause she has been concealing her real self all these years.  When she changes to who she really is people shun her and tell her to go back to being herself, but she still doesn't even know what that is yet.  Her relationship with Taichi and Inaba complicate this even more.  Inaba forces them together, but we learn later that Nagase doesn't really think they fit.  Even though Taichi is supposed to be the main character in this show, the title really should go to Nagase.\\n\\n\r\nInaba is the saving grace of this show.  She's easily one of the best developed characters alongside Nagase.  Her main problem is that she suffers from know-all syndrome, which means she KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN.  She knows that the phenomenons will either destroy or connect them, which just kills any sort of suspense made.  Apart from this, her intuition is one of the best devices in the show to advance the relationships between the characters.  If you look at the other characters, and how developed they are, that being Taichi and Nagase on the top, they interact a lot with Inaba.  Inaba herself isn't overly developed but serves as a vessel to develop the other characters.  Her attraction to Taichi is an interesting way to develop her character, but the show doesnt do so in a way that makes her seem mindless like Aoki.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) -  Absolutely loved it.  All of the components, while not perfect individually, fit together in a way that gave me maximum enjoyment.    Can't reccomend a better show to get the feels out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8) - A great series that is essential to become an expert anime watcher. Warning tho: you'll be stuck wondering what happens next so don't binge on school nights :p",

Then , probably Kokoro Connect is your choice!\r\nA fast paced story where the character's feelings towards their friends are revealed... with intense, comical, romantic and shocking scenes... Concerning its setting, it isn't mainstream at all! This could be just an slice of life/romance anime, but it isn't. It has got a definitely catching supernatural side, because everything that occurs during the anime is due to \"strange phenomena\". Consequently, the audience will probably feel empathy towards the characters and even reflect about what would happen if something likethat occured in real life!\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, I think you will be delighted if you give an opportunity to this intense anime specially because of the huge number of emotions revealed by the characters, who evolve constantly throughout the anime events. When you've finished watching the first 13 episodes, don't forget to watch the 4 OVAs! They definitely deserve it ;)\\n\\n\r\n(Sorry for spelling&grammar mistakes, I'm not a native english speaker).",

I personally really love anime with strong feels of friendship\r\nStory 10:\r\nChanging bodies, desire being released, turning into a younger age, your real emotions being heard by others. This was really a unique story of it's own. Adding these genres of drama, school life, romance comedy really made the story felt really good.

A BIG 10 out of 10, I really think almost anyone would really enjoy this anime. Connecting hearts and learning more about each other eh? That's friendship.",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect is an school drama, romantic, comedy that brings great depth to their characters by the supernatural experiences they encounter. My impression of Kokoro Connect soared beyond what I had originally imagined: The following 4 specials have become my favorite set of specials. Kokoro Connect managed to utilize all its supernatural occurrences skillfully, focusing less on overusing them and more on how they affect the five people members of the cultural research club.\r\nThe story follows 5 seemly normal youths (Aoki, Inaba, Yui, Taichi, and Inori) who's weaknesses are exposed through the meddling of some higher being. This higher being, Fuusenkazura, essentially just wants toexperiment on the cultural research club for both his and our enjoyment. It is weird that the story never really highlights why Fuusenkazura is toying with the members of the club, but I suppose they are too busy dealing with the mess he causes to be asking questions.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character of the story is Taichi, a noble person who honestly wants to help people out, a good character to view the story from as the rest of the cast experience body swapping, uncontrollable impulses, mental telepathy, time reversal, etc.. The story develops all the characters at once, but each event seems to cause the most trouble for specific members of the clubs who in turn of, for example, body swapping become extremely uncomfortable due to their inability to be around the opposite gender.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I mentioned that Taichi is the main character, it is really hard to make that judgment since most of the characters have equal involvement and impact in the story. Yui is an surprisingly docile girl for somebody who was well known for her martial art skills in middle school. Aoki is always high spirited and excited. He also has a crush on Yui, whom continuous to ignore his feelings, but thankfully Aoki is not annoying. Typically such a character drives me insane, but Aoki fawns over Yui like a 'normal' person would since after all she doesn't just quit the club. Inaba is very mysterious, serious, and looks out for the rest of the club members. Inori is always putting on a smile for everyone and acts friendly to the other members. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have their own unique quirks that become apparent as the show continues - I don't want to say anymore since the vast majority of the show is discovering the true identities of the characters and how they change.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has no fan service, and none of the supernatural occurrences have any sort of presence in the animation at all. To be honest the art isn't very impactful, but it is still very clean. It does clearly depict the characters emotions, and doesn't detract from the meaning behind their words and actions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this show to pretty much anyone. Some of the lessons the characters experience kind of make you reflect on your own life and how you live it. I will say that certain arcs had more impact than others. In finishing one arc I resonated with my heart and made me reflect for a good while. It managed to lift my spirits for a few days to be honest, but that is because it happened to coincide with what I had been thinking about. The show was Great (9), and I had no complaints watching this, so neither should you!",

            "content": "What defines a person? In other words, what is a person's identity? Is it his body? Is it his actions?  Is it his past? Is it his thoughts?\r\nKokoro Connect explores each of these four answers, one answer per arc, starting with the body-swapping arc exploring the answer of \"body\". Although Kokoro Connect might not take a proper stance on which answer is \"right\", it does give more than enough food for thought.\r\nBut don't expect Kokoro Connect to be too stressful, since it is fundamentally a romantic comedy slice-of-life show, although not a particularly normal one. It starts out by describing each of the characters'stereotyped personalities, which would normally be a bad idea. However, the show then proceeds to throughly deconstruct every single character, resulting in intriguing character development.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that makes Kokoro Connect shine is the humor. It has slapstick routines, witty sarcasm, sexual humor, and meta-jokes. But I particularly like how the show likes to make sudden switches from being serious to being comedic, which made me laugh a lot.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, Kokoro Connect is a quirky masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. Don't forget to watch the Michi Random arc (episodes 14-17). This series functions more like a 17-episode series than a 13-episode series plus a 4-episode extra.\\n\\n\r\nP.P.S. This is my first review on MAL. Yay!",

            "content": "Letting everyone know this review covers everything in the anime and plus the 4 additional episodes of the Michi Random Arc. The Video Review is out on my channel, but here is the Written Review.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nThe story of Kokoro Connect centers around a group of fives friends, in a High School club, known as the Student Cultural Research Club. What they do in the club in unimportant, it\u2019s what happens to them that is. One day, a supernatural experience happens to them, known as a phenomenon. The phenomenon they experience are swapping bodies, performing their innermost desires, reverting back to a younger age andreading each other\u2019s thoughts. All these supernatural happenings have something in common, it\u2019s all random.\\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses on how the characters face the phenomenon, how they handle it. The big overarching theme of the story is, \u2018Trust.\u2019 Such as, when switching bodies, can they trust each other not to do anything, that\u2019ll effect their social life, while the original is not in control with their bodies. Or when they can read minds, can really trust each other, after hearing what they said, but the thoughts in the mind is completely different.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the phenomenon are random, the plot can get confusing. It\u2019s kind of hard to sometimes tell when a character switches bodies. And the mind reading can happen so fast, it\u2019s possible to miss something. Some of the writing in the plot, can be very over dramatic, which can be annoying. However I think the concept is indeed interesting, trying to go on about your normal routine life, but then suddenly something supernatural happens to you, and you\u2019re completely thrown off. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nTaichi Yaegashi, is the main protagonist of the 5 characters. Well he is somewhat a stereotypical protagonist. When it comes to helping others, he cannot resist lending someone a hand. However it\u2019s because of that trait, it\u2019s considered his fault. It explores on his character, if he really wants to help people, or is it just because he can\u2019t help himself. However he\u2019s also the most reliable because of this trait.\\n\\n\r\nHimeko Inaba is the Vice President of the club. Because she is portrayed as somewhat lonely girl, she is distrustful of the others, however she does worry about them a lot, because she doesn\u2019t want to lose them as friends. Because she has trust issues, she doesn\u2019t really know who she is actually, she begins to question herself, if she does things to make others happy or to make herself happy. I love it how her character doesn\u2019t really fall into any stereotypical character traits. Although she is somewhat a lonely girl inside, she has a sense of seriousness, confidence and even humorous personality side to her.\\n\\n\r\nIori Nagase is the easy going President of the club, wait easy going? Oh no, after her initial appearance, you think she falls under the stereotypical character trope as being the happy go lucky girl. However because of her past experience with her fathers, she has learned to change personality to fit the situation to make everyone happy. So is she who really who she says she is? Again, they take a basic character archetype and they explore the idea of that character type, because honestly, no one can be easy going all the time.\\n\\n\r\nYoshifumi Aoki is the other guy member in the club, and also Taichi\u2019s best friend. He has an obvious crush on Yui and always confesses to her. He is actually the only member, the others can truly trust. Because his personality is so expressive, he actually usually does thing care freely. He lives life to the fullest, and brings positive energy to the group. However because he is willing to stay positive throughout the situations, he can be the least interesting of the five.\\n\\n\r\nThe last of our five is Yui Kiriyama. Yui has androphobia after she was almost raped in junior high school, so she doesn\u2019t trust the boys. So overtime, her friends help her gain the confidence to hang around the guys. Her personality and trust issues get worse as the story progresses, because even though she learns to trusts the others, its herself she cannot trust. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I love about these characters is how they\u2019re developed. When there is drama, the characters react perfectly, although some maybe dramatic more than the others. When character interact with each other, it makes sense on how they interact with each other. And it\u2019s good to see their relationship improve after learning more about each other and helping each other. I also love how the character may seem stereotypical at first, but then the plot and writers take their personalities on a whole different angle.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 7/10, 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is rather standard. It works well at looking clean and smooth, but other than it\u2019s not really that interesting or unique. Because most of the time, the characters are just talking with each other, they don\u2019t perform too many action for the animators to drastically do much. However the lighting in the anime looks gorgeous and fits the mood and setting very well. The characters designs are a bit different than other animes, but not too much. Plus it doesn\u2019t get distracted by fan service too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fits the mood and setting of the show, however it is really low so it\u2019s very hard to hear. However when you do listen to individually, it\u2019s not too bad. The voice acting is fine, especially Heartseed\u2019s voice, who is the one controlling the phenomenons, he has a very monotone tired voice to suit him. In terms of the Opening and Ending themes, they do their job, only the recognizable themes were the first opening, the michi random, and the first ending themes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series because it reminded me of a similar series I previously watched, however with more drama and less humor. I enjoyed the story and concept, I thought the characters were refreshing in a refreshing concept and plot. Although it can be over dramatic at times, it\u2019s when it\u2019s not, it flows so well. I also enjoyed a lot of the humor it had, the humor didn\u2019t distract from the mood too much, and I think the jokes were clever and smart, really fitting for a teen setting. I really loved watching how the relationships unfolded, plus there was an actual love story, that ended in one of the characters actually dating the other, and not going back to the status quo thing. The ending was satisfying for me. It felt like a proper ending, tying loose ends and you can see the characters changes. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the story of Kokoro Connect gets an 9 from me. I love that the story was interesting and unique. I love the different situations the characters were put in and thought they were paced quite well. Plus the ending was satisfying. Little problem was following the story, at times it will be confusing, because the phenomenons jumped quite a bit and can be over dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound both each gets a 7. The art style is nothing special, however it is cleanly and smoothly animated. But nothing special really happens. The lighting is fantastic however, it really suits the mood and settings of the show. The soundtrack suits the atmosphere very well as if you can hear them, it\u2019s a bit hard to hear. The themes are nothing special, they do their job, and they are a good listen.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters they get a 9 rating from me. Because I found them all interesting and unique. I loved that the writers made me think the characters were stereotypical, but then really change their personalities up to make them unique. I think they were well developed as well. Their interactions and reactions with each other made sense. I think they the whole cast is likeable in one way or another.\\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 9. Because it really reminded me of Haruhi in a way. But I enjoyed the concept and loved the characters. I think the humor and writing was smart, they made me really love these characters and the genre. I thought the series was paced well, with a satisfying ending.\\n\\n\r\nSo after rounding that all up, I give Kokoro Connect an 8/10. It\u2019s an interesting concept with a cast of interesting characters, who are well developed. However the animation and sound is rather standard. I recommend this anime to fans of the slice of life, drama, romance and supernatural genre. I think because of those storylines, the plot can really appeal to those people. However if you\u2019re not into that, it\u2019s fine to skip it, but\u2019s worth your time if you watch it, just don\u2019t expect too many things to happen, because the animation is rather standard. I love the characters, and I believe you love the characters.\\n",

With that mentality i watched the first few minutes of first episode and i dropped it. When i came upon Yui, i decided to give this anime one more try. \r\nI decided to watch the anime for Yui and when i started to watch kokoro connect with a different perspective, i was blown away by its amazing Character developments and story. I learnt never to judge a book by its cover.\r\nIn this story there are,\r\nYaegashiTaichi : the guy who is dense but apparently the girls like him\\n\r\nNagase Iori : Playful, energetic and the one cracking the jokes\\n\r\nKiriyama Yui : The beauty of the group\\n\r\nAoki Yoshifumi : The main character's best friend who has problems in love\\n\r\nand lastly my most Favorite ...\\n\r\nInaba Himeko : The strong girl who doesn't seems to have any problems and most commonly seen using violence on the main character.\\n\\n\r\nWhat i like about this anime is that it brings out a lot of emotions. With different situations, people would react differently due to each of their personality. The situations causes each character to open up to their inner personality which makes each of them very unique as their friendship is put to the test.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime has not only put me through emotional and happy moments but it was really enjoyable. i would recommend this anime to people who really enjoy Romance, Friendship. \\n",

            "content": "First off, this review will also be including the 4 episodes in the Michi Random specials. \r\nLet me keep this quick and simple. Five students in a club encounter strange phenomenon's caused by something/someone who calls themselves 'Heartseed'. Although it seems light hearted in the beginning of the anime, it's much more complex. As a result of Heartseed's actions, the five students find out a lot about eachother in which they have never shared with anyone before the phenomenon's began. It makes these characters not only learn a lot about their friends, but also about themselves. They discover who they are, and secrets that werehidden beneath exteriors. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 9/10\\n\r\nThe pacing of the anime was good. It wasn't too short or too long and presented the events as they would naturally occur in terms of time. This gave a good amount of time to show character development of each character. It told the stories of different characters and had great character development.  It balanced humour and drama, however why my score isn't a 10 is due to the animes lack of explanation in some parts. If you watch it you'll understand that it leaves you slightly confused, but overall the ending was touching and a nice tie up to all of the events that had occurred. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\nThe design of characters and settings within the anime is simple. Each of the main characters have a cute presentation that add to the simplicity of their character. It articulates that although many have their own personal issues, we hide it behind our exterior whether we look cheerful or stern. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nThe voice actors/actresses were perfect for each character. The voice acting was great, and the osts/opening/ending themes were a nice touch to the anime too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\r\nThe anime had a nice set of characters who were not perfect at all. One is a selfish freak, another is sensitive due to her past, one feels useless, one doesn't know who she is and one doesn't know what she wants. But these characters show their development as a person through the help of each other and the realisation of how helpful and important their connection and communication to each other truly is. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\r\nKokoro Connect is about connection. It teaches its audience to value and hold those close to them. It was an enjoyable anime that I do recommend to those who enjoy animes with some meaning or centred around connection/self discovery. It might just be me, but I see this as a very meaningful anime that teaches a valuable lesson to its viewers; to simply live life how you want, and that opening up to other people is sometimes the best way to find who you want to be and solve your problems. Overall, 9/10. Definitely should watch! :)\\n",

            "content": "When i first saw Kokoro connect, I thought that it was your usual teenage drama/high school anime, with slight tinges of romance. When I heard from my friends that the first arc was about body swapping and manipulating the supernatural, i KNEW i had to watch this.\r\nEach character has their own unique traits and behavior and I really liked the way that they interacted with each other. For the Summer 2012 anime charts, I feel that Kokoro Connect is the best out of all the others that have been aired.\r\nI would give a 10/10 for the first arc. The first arc simply outclasses the othertwo arcs that are shown in the anime by a couple of miles. The concept of body swapping is innately a curious topic, everybody wants to know what it is like to step into another's shoes. Kokoro connect takes that and explores the psychological and social consequences of body swapping, rather than merely the comedic side of it like most other animes do.\\n\\n\r\nHeartseed is shown to be a god figure that is able to manipulate the supernatural. And because of his 'godlike' powers, KC's story can expand without restrictions even though the setting and characters are limited. With every power that Heartseed throws them, the characters grow in depth and learn more about themselves, their friends, their parents and solve problems that they would never have been able to solve without Heartseed's meddling influence. \\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10\\n\r\nKokoro Connect is a realistic take of a supernatural situation, which is unique for an anime series. The emotional journey between the 5 of them is deep, and the dialogues are simply superb. There is a well thought out balance between drama, comedy and slice of life. Romance, inevitably, is a part of this too, but it's a small part of this anime, like the final dressing on a cake made to perfection.\\n\r\nAlthough it hasn't quite kicked in during these 13 episodes, Kokoro Connect's storyline is going to be quite repetitive, without a main plot, later seasons of this anime are bound to fail\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm a little biased here, because the art for Kokoro Connect is the same as K-on (my favourite moeblob). The character designs are great and their facial expressions are well drawn out. Other than that there is nothing really fanciful about the animation here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nOut of the OST, ED 1 & 3 are really good. Kokoro no Kara and Salvage were my favorite songs the moment i heard them. Besides that, the other OPs and EDs were quite decent, and the bgs are simple but fitted the situations when they played. I found the OST to be quite limited though\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is the best part about this show! Kokoro Connect has only a few characters, and because of this, the characters are very well developed. It goes from Taichi's sense of justice, Aoki's inferiority, Yui's shyness, Iori's multi-dimensioned personality and Inaba's reservedness. Each of their unique characters initially cause friction against each other, but how they develop and bond together throughout this anime is truly heartwarming. Every experience pulls them together despite their differences. I especially liked the interactions between Inaba and Taichi and their dialogues together\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nIt has a good blend of tension and light-heartedness, which i found to be very enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime that the drama and slice of life fans shouldn't miss.",

            "content": "Well, this is my first Anime review for an Anime I personally really enjoyed. But this review won't be spectacular so don't expect anything from this. \r\nThe Story: The flow of the story itself was very smooth and the idea of it is in my opinion fantastic. It was handled pretty well but this was definitely not the biggest point the Anime was good on.\r\nArt: The graphics are nothing special or outstanding, you can find this artsytle almost anywhere but it matches the atmosphere of the Anime.\r\nSound: Great openings and endings, it surprsies me that it had multiple ones since it's pretty short but almostnone of them were memorable so it was a bit disappointing. Same goes to the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Now here comes the strongest point. Seriously, this Anime lives for the characters. Every one of the main characters has it's own personality and no one is alike. None of them feel unnecessary or annoying, their strong hold on each other completes them and they shine with their personalities. No one is abandoned in the dirt, they have equal character development and their own moments. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I can't say how entertaining this Anime was for me. The jokes were absolutely spot on, but the characters are what makes this Anime so fun to watch. And the finale made everything even better....\\n\\n\r\nOverall: In my eyes I see Kokoro Connect as the best High School/Slice Of Life Anime that is out there. It's one of my favourites and I would recommend it to everyone out there. These 17 Episodes are absolutely worth it. \\n\\n\r\nBY THE WAY: Don't forget to watch the OVA of the Anime. It has 4 \"special\" episodes but they are essential to the story and complete it so don't forget to watch those too!",

Apparently I was too young then to recognize greatness even when I was looking at it. But I'm so happy I gave it another shot, it has truly been a privilege to watch this show. Very few anime's have a story line that is as great as the one from this anime. It deals with serious problems, but somehow it still managed to make me laugh from time to time. I also think the way that the characters dealwith their problems is very realistic and really pulls you into the show. Kokoro Connect will go down in the books for me as one of the best anime's out there and I highly urge you to check it out.",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect is one of my personal favorite animes of all time. It's a series I watch multiple times a year just because of how much I enjoy it... Now that's not to say this anime doesn't have flaws, every anime has at least a few flaws however it's one of those animes that you love so much that you're able to look past those flaws just because of how much you enjoy it...\r\nKokoro Connect includes tons of different genres all in one convenient package, from comdey, romance, drama and even a little bit of ecchi. The anime focuses mostly on drama however it's notafraid to add some comedy or ecchi to lighten the scene a little bit. The characters are extremely relatable and not a single person is able to just single handily fix all their problems, they have to help one another through all the problems they will face... Not even the main character Yaegashi Taichi is able to solve his problems on his own, he faces his own issues and is affected by the same things as everyone else. Taichi doesn't just feel like one of those invulnerable main protagonists that face no issues and are able to solve every issue with no problem. Even Taichi will have to rely on his friends every once and a while to remind him that he needs to keep moving forward and that he's not alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot for Kokoro Connect is amazing, I always love it when animes (espically drama's) deal with heavier topics and issues that LOTS of people deal with on a daily bases. I'm not gonna spoil what happens but if you're going to watch it be prepared for them to be dealing with some controversial subjects. They deal with these topics appropriately and efficently, the way they deal with their issues is very realistic and isn't just some \"with the power of friendship we can get through anything and everything with no problem!\" crap.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime only has 13 episodes and manages to get allot done in such a short amount of time. I'm honestly not a huge fan of the ending but it wasn't necessarily terrible, just ended a little to quickly. This anime may not be for everyone but if you're a fan of drama's like Your Lie in April and Angel Beats I think you'll be able to find some enjoyment in this anime...\\n",

            "content": "I wondered if I should give this show an 8 or a 1.  It wasn't a choice between 7 or 8 or 9, but between 8 and 1.\r\nIn categories of plot, dialogue, and characters Kokoro Connect is nothing short of stellar.  For lack of a better expression, I was reminded a lot of Bakemonogatari in terms of both superficial similarities, AND in terms of the subtlety and general quality of the writing.  That is just about the biggest praise I can subjectively crown upon an anime series, and it means that Kokoro Connect is up there with the very best when itcomes to the writing.  That, and the very moment I heard Inaba's voice for the first time, I was like KANBARUUUUUUUU.\\n\\n\r\nComparisons aside, the general premise of the story is actually somewhat mundane, but that does not work negatively in this case.  The series wastes little time in quickly and efficiently setting up the overall format of the story: a group of 5 high school students being subjected various psychological and social \"experiments,\" during which their secrets, insecurities, and relationships are brutally exposed and tested.  As is frequently stated within the show, it is ultimately an experiment to see how the 5 friends react as a single crucial variable in their lives are tweaked one by one.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, this kind of plot device lends heavily to character development.  Indeed, the plot itself has no significance other than to drive character development.  In this category, the series also impressed.  The characters, or rather, the way they are written, stand tall among a sea of lesser characters from lesser anime.  To be honest, I have personally outgrown many of the problems and insecurities felt by the very realistic high school student characters, but I could still identify with the characters in a reminiscent manner, if not directly sympathize with them.  I can only guess that the characters hit even closer to home for people in their teens, which I assume would be the target audience.  Just for sake of finding a flaw to talk about, I felt that Aoki was a little lacking.  This fact is actually directly admitted to and discussed within the show, but I still could not help but feel that it was a missed potential.  His character is genuinely likable, especially when he received some long-overdue development, so it was a bit disheartening to see him still relegated as the token comic relief.  Some of his actions and lines are honestly pretty cool, so I wish he could've been written as a slightly more \"cool\" character, rather than an exclusively comical one.  Later on, during his more serious moments, it felt a bit like Rivalz was trying to act in Suzaku's shoes, to put it into Code Geass terms.  Besides, every other member of the cast is capable of their share of comic relief, so having someone within the MAIN CAST as the exclusive comic relief guy was maybe a bit too much.  But again, that is a minor error that I noticed, and the characters are overall written very, very well.  The more you pay attention to subtle hints, foreshadowing, etc, the more you will catch, adding to your increasing awe of the writing.\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, is Kokoro Connect ultimately a top-level, A-class anime?  Frankly not at all.  Note the aspects of the show that I praised: the story, the characters, the writing...  Yes, everything that came from the source material, the light novels, are deserving of the title \"masterpiece,\" but EVERYTHING ELSE is just pathetic, to be quite frank.  I would ruthlessly give the score of 1 or 2 in every technical category, such as quality of animation, sound, etc.  I do concede that many of these problems may stem from budget issues.  I am really willing to give them the benefit of the doubt because the quality is so extraordinarily bad that one assumes there must have been some extenuating circumstance.  The base line of production quality in contemporary works, even the most abysmal ones, is far higher than that exhibited by Kokoro Connect.  Furthermore, the quality skyrockets in the last 4 episodes, which were released some time after the first 13 had aired, no doubt enjoying the financial benefits of the show's success.  This lends further evidence to my \"budget issues\" theory, but really, the horror of the animation quality in the earlier episodes has to be seen to be believed.\\n\\n\r\nEven after giving the show a benefit of a doubt, there are some unequivocal and undeniable problems.  As always I do not feel good about singling out a creator, a professional in the industry who no doubt knows far more than I do.  However, there is no avoiding the verdict that Kokoro Connect is a very, very, oh so beautifully written, but it is frankly poorly directed.  There is little, if any, variation in camera angle, frame, etc. to aid the dramatic storytelling.  When two characters are talking, it will invariably be a bland two-shot of static frames with only the mouths moving.  When the characters are walking, it will literally be slow-panning profile shot that literally just follows them as they are literally just walking.  You get the point.  Many times, I thought \"why even bother to make an anime adaptation?\"  It would not have been much different to listen to an audio drama of the original light novel while scrolling through the static images that were already on the LN.  Did they adapt this to a motion picture medium just so we could watch the character's mouths move?  To a certain point, minimalism can be a choice of style, but in case of Kokoro Connect, it doesn't seem to be a conscientious choice, but rather a lack of style and a complete abandoning of the huge potential of visual storytelling inherent in anime as a visual genre.  As I noted above, in terms of writing, Kokoro Connect does many things Bakemonogatari does just as well, but it is absolutely pitiful in comparison to the rich visuals of the latter.  I'm not saying that they should've gone full SHAFT with their trademark splurge visuals, but at least take advantage of the very minimal devices to spice up the stellar story.  Even something as small as 0.5 second of lingering gaze, dramatic camera angle, or a timely zoom-in could add so much punch to the emotional scenes and the surprisingly good humor points.  Instead, the sheer genius of the writing carries this show on its back; it is a lonely, lonely path with zero help from visual storytelling.  That in itself is impressive, I suppose, but also a bit frustrating to watch.  The missed opportunities, the untapped potential.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I did not have the heart to give this anime adaptation the terrible score it very well deserved.  It is frankly an utter failure as an adaptation.  However, out of respect for the very impressive writing, I decided to take off only 1 point from the absolutely stellar score of 9 and gave it an 8, which, in my standards, is still an A- or a very good B+.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*********************************************************\\n\r\nUSELESS BONUS CONTENT: Comparison with Bakemonogatari\\n\r\nWARNING. FREE SPOILERS FOR BOTH SERIES. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\\n\\n\\n\r\nMany are the reasons I am almost sure that the author had read and was heavily influenced by Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-The Male MC is someone who feels compelled to help those around him, even at the cost of great suffering or risk unto himself.\\n\\n\r\n-MC is ultimately monogamous...\\n\\n\r\n-Urban fantasy setting in modern Japan.  High school.\\n\\n\r\n-The supernatural element is deeply psychological and/or existential.\\n\\n\r\n-There is a bizarre and nebulous sense of existential threat looming over every moment of the series.  Highly subjective, admittedly.\\n\\n\r\n-The flashing text panels in KC that just HAVE to be a lame attempt to imitate the iconic device used in Bakemonogatari.\\n\\n\r\n-Extremely tight ensemble cast with few (actually none in BKM) extras.\\n\\n\r\n-Brazenly and gallantly and MONOGAMOUSLY erotic in terms of writing, but not so much visual fanservice. Arguable in BKM, but, say, compared to the standard ecchi anime that would discuss the similar, very explicit  topics ventured in either anime.\\n\\n\r\n-Winning girls possess sharp wit, dark soul, and cold personality.  Their opening up is a central theme.\\n\\n\r\n-Many of the traumatic backstories involve strikingly similar themes, such as being the unknowing perpetrator of blackout violence sprees, rape attempt, bullying, jealousy, etc.  However, one could argue that such themes are ubiquitous in modern anime.\\n\\n\r\n-Sisconic elements.  Though, comparing the sisincest level of KC and BKM would be like comparing your dog to Obama, respectively. \\n\\n\r\nOnly in Bakemonogatari:\\n\r\n-A harem, nay, a demi-harem, thanks to Araragi's unwavering adherence to monogamy\\n\\n\r\n-Sound effects and BGM\\n\\n\r\n-High quality, indeed, legendary visual animation\\n\\n\r\nOnly in Kokoro Connect:\\n\r\n-Friendship\\n\\n\r\n-The necessity for an awkward beta-couple arrangement, thanks to Taichi not stepping up to be the Monogamous Harem King that he was born to be.  The Monogamous Harem King is a glorious existence that sits far atop the power ranking pyramid of contemporary anime.",

            "content": "I recommend Kokoro Connect to everyone who loves the slice of life and romance genre\r\n[NO SPOILERS]\r\nStory 10 / 10\r\nKokoro Connect is one of my personal favorites.\r\nThe story itself is absolutely amazing. The writers take something as switching bodies, what has been done over and over by other movies and turn it into something unbelievably good! The way the characters develop throughout the show is outstanding: when you think you know them well enough, another phenomenon occurs which changes your view on them completely. It is because of this great story telling that the overused idea of switching bodies doesn't seem lame but exciting. Although Iwon't spoil anything for you, the other phenomena are even better than the first one, revealing more about the characters, peeling the superficial layer off these kids, showing their true selfs and their desires and dreams.\\n\\n\r\nBecause the story is so well written, even though it starts out with, in my opinion, such a boring plot as body switching, it definately desirves a 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI love the art of Kokoro Connect. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty normal for an anime, but that's why I like it so much. I don't think a different style would suit Kokoro Connect, so to me, they made a good choice just sticking to regular art.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 7 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST isn't anything special. The first ending theme of Kokoro Connect however is my favorite ending theme of all time. Look it up, it's called --> Kokoro no kara\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10 / 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you would just watch the first couple of episodes of Kokoro Connect, you wouldn't give the characters 10 out of 10. No way you'd give them 10 out of 10. They would be pretty bland: 7 / 10 tops. All characters have their own certain traits. \\n\r\nInaba is bossy, cold and strong, Taichi is a goody two-shoes, Nagase is always cheery, Aoki is laid-back and Yui loves karate and cute things.\\n\\n\r\nBut through all these phenomena all these things will change. The characters develop so well, that eventually, you WILL bond with them. And at then end of this anime, you will definately give them a 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI love this anime. It's truly a masterpiece. Unfortunately I got some interesting anime to watch right now, but the moment I don't, I'm going to rewatch this one. That's how good Kokoro Connect is. None of the episodes are boring or hard to get through. You don't need to sit through the first couple of episodes before you finaly get to the good part. Absolutely not! This anime is fun and interesting from episode 1 to the final episode!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10 / 10\\n\\n\r\nThe writers have taken something as overused as body switching and used it to create a masterpiece. The phenomena create characters that are completely stripped from their superficial layer and show what kind of people they really are.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is good though fairly regular and the sound, with a few exceptions (like kokoro no kara) is also nothing special. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are at first glance normal but reveal themselves to be much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Kokoro Connect is a masterpiece which I recommend to everyone!",

            "content": "This review contains small spoilers, but not like it will ruin your viewing experience, so I gaurantee you that.\r\nWell, to start, I recommend this anime when you're looking for a sitback moment, take your drink and food and watch this serie in one run. It wil definitly make your day.\r\nSo now to the review.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nThis is one of the most thought-about anime I've seen. The story itself is compleet. It takes a chlich\u00e9e (Don't you dare to say that swapping bodies isn't clich\u00e9e.) subject and making it a strong pillar to held on. The story only goes about it, but what they managed to dois fantastic with it. Starting with a not knowing what to do individual teenagers. They decide, because they have to, to group up and make their own club. They become friend, strange things happen, but they make it not like suddenly Taicho evolves into an monster or something. In the later episodes there happens something that is quite unbelievable, but believe me! It makes perfect sense. There is an explenation for it all!\\n\r\nWell I'm getting of tracks. But it has a LOT of good things. But the critic I am, and I know Slice of life isn't all about realism, but purly on showing someones life. But somethings, I've to admit have bother me a little. For example, in the last episode after Inaban [SpoilerFree] and they are walking with them five talking about what hapend, the moments when that one guy [SpoilerFree] and Taicho got the full load. (All those dirty minded people are now laughing. No it's not THAT!)\\n\r\nWell I found that quite unrealistic, but after thinking about it now, it makes sense and it really completed the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nNo comment. Loved the style and detail to those CUTE expressions from Inaban.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nNothing bothered me. So a big 9.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (development)\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nHorrible character development.\\n\r\nNah just kidding, it really focused on character development. And it actually is debatable if it is so good that you an compare it the Clannad. I mean, everyone has their piece of background.\\n\r\nExcept Taiho. And that quite confuses me the most. In the whole story they really focussed on all the other characters but rather forgot the most important piece. If they added an episode purely focused on Taicho I would've given a 10/10. But it didn't bother me that much.\\n\r\nMaybe they could've put more detail in the background story with Nana, but I guess it's alright?\\n\\n\r\nSo I enjoyed it a lot. My final result: 8/10\\n\r\nWell deserved 8 and a recommended serie!\\n\\n",

            "content": "On one hand, I really loved this show. On the other\u2026 I didn\u2019t like it as much as I wanted to. I tend to see the two main components of Kokoro Connect (the friendship story and the mystical/supernatural elements of the story that led to the kids getting closer) as two very separate things, because one was done very well, and the other just\u2026 wasn\u2019t. Which is unfortunate. If it had been a truly great show, these components would have blended together effortlessly, like I assume was the intention, but I think I\u2019m getting a little ahead of myself. \r\nTo start with what Kokoro Connectdid well, I love these types of friendship stories: where something brings a group of kids who don\u2019t have much in common together and then forces them to suddenly get real close, real fast. At first, it\u2019s the school these five attend, which requires every student to join a club. This group ends up together just because they don\u2019t really fit in anywhere else. (A premise that has a lot of potential on its own.) But the real catalyst is when they suddenly start swapping bodies for brief periods of time. \\n\\n\r\nThis series gets off to a really good start. I\u2019ve always felt that the first episode is pretty brilliant. The whole thing takes place almost exclusively in their club room, and we barely know these kids at this point, but it felt obvious, even to a first-time viewer, how out of place Iori\u2019s high-energy reactions and mannerisms looked in Taichi\u2019s body. It just felt like a very fun, very clever way to introduce us to and acquaint us with these characters. And the atmosphere and tone of the whole thing was great too. Even with its more lighthearted moments, the scenes where it really sunk in for them that this crazy, unexplainable thing was actually happening felt genuinely eerie. It felt very real to me. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as the series goes on, I came to really like all the characters and their personal stories. Everything from Himeko\u2019s pride to Iori\u2019s identity issues\u2026 Aoki questioning what it really means to love someone and Taichi\u2019s battle between selfishness and selflessness\u2026 And especially Yui\u2019s journey to recover from a past sexual assault over the course of the series\u2026 Every single one of them moved me at some point, and I think they\u2019re all relatable in their own ways. And I loved seeing them all grow closer as the anime went on, navigating these increasingly invasive supernatural happenings. \\n\\n\r\nWhich unfortunately leads us in to the part of this story that was not handled quite so well. We are technically given an answer as to why these things are happening: in the form of Heartseed, this vague alien(?) being that\u2019s taken over the teacher who acts as their club advisor. But it is one of the most half-assed excuses for anything that I\u2019ve ever seen. Heartseed has no personality or motivations to speak of. He tells them they\u2019re entertainment to him and these things will just keep happening until he grows bored of them. \\n\\n\r\nWhich does happen. Kind of. Once they\u2019re rid of the body swapping, they start losing their impulse control for brief periods of time. After these \u2018unleashed desires\u2019 come to an end, brief periods of de-aging begin. And after the de-aging, they start hearing each others\u2019 thoughts. And I think the worst thing is\u2026 that it\u2019s not like these aren\u2019t interesting ideas. But I was losing patience with this show before it was even half over. Heartseed is nothing more than a weak plot device, an excuse for the creator to play with these (genuinely interesting and likable) characters. We\u2019re never given any deeper explanation of what/who Heartseed is. It just felt\u2026 lazy. It felt like blatant creator manipulation, which was really disappointing to me.\\n\\n\r\nI think whether or not you\u2019ll enjoy this show really depends on what you\u2019re looking to get out of it. The heartfelt friendship story is really good, but the supernatural plotline that\u2019s meant to be the big, driving force behind it all is really lackluster. Personally, I wanted both. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not going to write a separate review for the Michi Random episodes, but it should be noted that they\u2019re not really OVAs in the way that I tend to think of them: as mini adventure stories unrelated to the main plot. The Michi Random OVAs are really just the last four episodes of the show, wrapping up the love triangle, Iori\u2019s personal journey, and (sort of) the business with Heartseed. I do think it\u2019s important to note, though, before you jump in, that the episodes that really complete the series were only ever released on DVD. (Instead of reaching the end of episode 13, like me, and Then realizing there\u2019s more to the story.) \\n",

            "content": "I know I'm way too late to be posting this review on a nearly 8 year old show - my very first review that I will be posting on here at that, but whatever. When I first watched Kokoro Connect around the time it was airing, I think my first impression was that I liked it (even though I probably didn't watch all of it very thoroughly), but after re-watching it many years later, I was quite surprised and disappointed by how bad it is... no, I wouldn't necessarily call it bad, but it is incredibly mediocre. This review will cover the entire series, includingthe OVAs that continue the storyline, and it will contain a few spoilers, but I will keep it as brief as I can because I don't want to waste too much of my time discussing the utter waste of time that is this show. Anyway, here we go.\\n\\n\r\nForced drama. Forced drama everywhere. If there was one word to sum up this show, it would be \u201cmelodramatic\u201d. And that\u2019s saying a lot, considering I am one of the most sentimental people you could meet, but Kokoro Connect didn\u2019t do much for me, despite its ceaseless screaming for sympathy points. I meant that last part half-literally, because every damn character in the show was screaming their head off every other minute of every episode out of frustration, self-loathing, anger or sorrow, or whatever other emotion that I didn't care about because I felt too detached from the characters to actually care much about any of them. Look, I know that considering these are teenagers that were thrown suddenly into a whole inexplicable predicament of uncontrollable and unpredictable body-switching, telepathy that involuntarily revealed their darkest thoughts and deepest hidden feelings to their closest friends, time/growth regression that rendered them quite helpless, it\u2019s perfectly normal and understandable for them to overreact and lose their heads over these occurrences and other smaller things, but there are so many more better ways to handle and portray drama besides making the characters scream themselves hoarse for several long minutes straight, with an occasional mix of physical violence there. There are quite a few words to describe this show, but \u201csubtle\u201d certainly is not in its vocabulary. It just tells you everything and spoon-feeds you all the details without actually showing it most of the time, or instead choosing to make the characters TELL you before revealing any context or physical evidence or even any foreshadowing at all. For instance, the whole thing with Nagase and Taichi\u2019s romantic feelings towards each other that would\u2019ve been completely unnoticeable had Inaba not mentioned it out loud, or the thing with Yui\u2019s androphobia that we only get the chance to learn about when Aoki casually brings it up with no context whatsoever, and much more. This show might as well be yelling at the audience: \u201cTHIS GIRL IS TERRIFIED OF MEN, PITY HER, THIS POOR TRAUMATIZED CREATURE; AND THIS OTHER GIRL HERE IS SUFFERING FROM AN IDENTITY CRISIS AND IS ACTING LIKE A TOTAL BITCH BECAUSE *GASP* SHE WAS ACTUALLY LIKE THAT ALL ALONG AND WAS ONLY HIDING HER TRUE SELF, FEEL SORRY FOR HER NOW BECAUSE SHE IS A VICTIM OF A BROKEN HOME THAT DESTROYED HER\u201d, and other ramblings about the rest of the characters and their mostly contrived problems. If there's anything this show is good at, it is creating a myriad unnecessary misunderstandings between the characters and TELLING instead of SHOWING - seems like someone didn't pay attention to the crucial yet basic tip of \"show, don't tell\" that any other decent writer would actually listen to.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, there is... well, not much to speak of. They can all be described in generic archetypes: Taichi the nice guy/selfless white knight, Aoki the useless \u201ccomic relief sidekick\u201d, Inaba the cool tough girl, Yui the cute tsundere (kind of, at least toward Aoki), and finally Nagase the genki girl with a surprisingly dark past/hidden real personality.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and soundtrack were alright, nothing too special, but the voice acting was great, especially Sawashiro Miyuki who excelled at portraying Inaba's character and conveying her emotional turmoil. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of the show is really interesting and quite original, but the writers just butchered the story and characters, who are supposed to be the main devices to carry the story ahead but somehow managed to make the story boring. I didn\u2019t want to be too harsh because ultimately I was somewhat still entertained by the show, enough to keep watching, but for the most part, especially through the second half, I felt like I was dragging through each episode just to get to the conclusion, which was... okay, I guess. Extremely mediocre and predictable is all I can say. The villain (who would make absolutely no difference to the story even if he wasn\u2019t shoehorned into it for the sake of thrills and extra drama) disappears without a single trace along with the problems that he plagued the main characters with, and the main characters return to being normal best friends forever and all is well. Yawn. The End. Time to move onto the next anime that will most likely erase all memory of this one from my mind.",

            "content": "I don't know what I was expecting from this anime, but it definitely wasn't what I got. My main issue with this anime wasn't the characters or the plot, but rather what was lacking. \r\nWhat I mean by that is it was missing an element of story and excitement that it would've benefited from. For example, you're going into this anime knowing that these kids are going to switch personalities with each other, right? The anime should explain why that's happening, don't you think? But it doesn't. It gives you a vague idea as to how this phenomenon is happening, but it doesn't tell youwhy. That's the reason I couldn't fully enjoy this anime. No matter what happened in the plot or with the characters that I enjoyed, I was still left wondering what the bigger picture was. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the overall story wasn't bad at all. It conveyed a nice message about friendship and what it means to be there for the people you care about. I do think that the issues that were brought up throughout the season were brought up a little sporadically, but for the most part, the characters all had a consistent, logical motive behind whatever actions we were seeing from them. They weren't as developed as they should've been considering the fact that we, as the audience, were supposed to be really connected to them, but they weren't completely flat either.\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely describe this anime as above average, but I think the weirdness of the backstory made it a little bland to watch at the end of the day. I wouldn't come back to it, but if you're interested in darker anime like Future Diary or even Death Note, you may find yourself a little bit interested in this. Though it isn't as dark as those anime, it does have those elements. I won't be coming back to this one, but it wasn't a waste of time. That pretty much sums it up.",

            "content": "For the entry on this series, the first two tags under genre are \u2018comedy\u2019 and \u2018drama\u2019, and I\u2019m pretty much inclined to agree. How much someone enjoys this series will vary by person, but for the most part, I think that the series successfully accomplishes what it sets out to do.\r\nSo the anime follows three girls and two guys - a typical five man band - who are thrown into various fantastical situations, and the story goes from there.\r\nWhat I really liked about this series was the character development. Throughout these 13 episodes (I really want to see those last four now) the viewer getsto see relationships tested and strained, broken and rebuilt. Personalities are examined, boundaries challenged, and characters changed. These five people interact with each other, argue with each other, and over the course of all the crap that happens to them, begin to really understand each other. A lot of issues get brought up. Self-worth, trauma, identity, family, friendship, love, and a whole lot of relationships in general. And in the whole mess of life that each person experiences, they learn more about what it means to be human, and what it means to be themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThis is all kind of a lot to take in though, so here are a couple points I think that the anime could have improved on. First, I don\u2019t typically watch dramas, and this one is pretty heavy handed, as there are at least one or two (lengthy) scenes of people talking with raised voices (yelling), crying, or both in each episode. If you can\u2019t handle lots of drama, you won\u2019t like this. Another point of concern is that stuffing this much content into 13 episodes means portions of the plot may end up largely unoriginal; I have to say that I was never really surprised at any of the plot twists (not sure if I\u2019d even call it that).\\n\\n\r\nDespite this, I think the characters make up for it. From laughing to crying, sleeping to waking, eating to dumping, you get to see every character from a myriad of perspectives (actually, not entirely sure about that last one, but there were certainly a number of toilet scenes).\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the drama in the plot, the comedy was actually funny, the animation itself was clean, and I didn\u2019t have any complaints about the music or soundtrack, and on the contrary actually found myself looking for a couple tracks after I\u2019d finished the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a well crafted and satisfying story.",

            "content": "The anime Kokoro connect is really a surprise among the anime of this season. At the first glance, it looks like a typical light school life/ comedy/ romance anime, but it turns out to be much more than just \"typical\". in fact, the whole anime is full of surprises. \r\nThe main plot of this anime is simple but there are often some unexpected twists make u speechless. The switching between the characters are also done nicely. This not only give the viewer different perspective of the story and also keep the story clean and crisp. One problem I have though is that the story startoff really slow so many might find the first ep kinda boring.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it was generally on the good side, but for today's standard, this level can only be given a good. Though, the scenery and background details are done quite nicely. However, throughout the anime, I did catch some small flaws in the animation. For example in ep 2, 5 and ep 10, some actions are repetitive and disync with the anime, which made the animation look at little weird. Still, most people probably will omit these small little flaw through the story so it is more like picking bones from an egg.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound department, the background themes are well done and fit the situation appropriately. Especially for the first ending and final ending for the last arc. I did not really like the 2nd ED and the OP though. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the best part is the charcter development. First of all the characters are funny and unique. Each of the five characters have some personal trauma or personal weakness that they bury deep within them. The anime lead us to each of their dark past and inner emotions as each character interact. Then as the series process, each chracter grow and evolve through hardship, conflicts and sometiems even stupidity. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it is very enjoyable anime and I would recommand people to give the first five ep a try. As to those who drop it in first ep, the later eps are more interesting, u should really give it another chance. I would say if u reach the third ep and still hate the anime then drop it then",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect, an anime centering around 5 highschool students whos lives are suddenly changed when weird events begin to unfold. This anime is quite appealing in many ways, as the first few episodes draw you in incredibly well with the first event that occurs between the 5 students. HOWEVER, the later episodes, even though good and entertaining, it is most definately not as engaging as the earlier episodes. \r\nFirstly, what the anime does very well, is the trials and obstacles which the 5 protagonist must endure and overcome are very engaging and interesting to watch. The characters are also varied enough to appeal to agreater audience, as well as having great visuals and music, the anime is well done, however what the anime lacks, is RESOLUTION. \\n\\n\r\nEven with its unique characters, and interesting plot twists, the anime has too many holes, holes in the story which should have been explained and resolved through out the anime and the end. This somewhat ruins the anime in a way, as it seems somewhat incomplete, and too random at times.\\n\\n\r\nI gave this anime a 4, HOWEVER, i was considering rating it a 3. Why? Because even though this anime is great, and is definately something i recommend for all its pros, this anime feels somewhat lacking and unmemorable towards the end, which is quite frustrating seeing as this anime is a good anime.\\n\r\nAll in all, 4/5 overall, however my personal opinion would be, that this anime is lacking that something which would have made it GREAT. (The Kokoro Connect game has recently been released on PSP, so maybe the stories plot-holes can be filled :])",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect:\r\nWhen I first heard of Kokoro Connect I wasn't really all that interested to be honest. As from what it tells you it's that it's a whole series that revolves around five high school students: Taichi Yaegashi (our main lead), Iori Nagase, Himeko Inaba, Yoshifumi Aoki, and Yui Kiriyama who all form a club called the \"Student Concial Society\" (or StuCS for short) which is a paper for the school.\r\nI thought there was no way an thirteen episode series could be carried on the cliche of switching bodies. However, I quickly came to reilize how dead wrong I was when I got absolutely hookedonto the show after a friend reccomended it too me and I gotta say, it was definitely one of the best shows of the summer 2012 anime season.\\n\\n\r\nIt's too bad the synopsis only speaks of the body swapping phenomenon that starts when Aoki and Kiriyama claim to have swapped bodys for a breif second that night. Of course nobody believes them until Taichi and Iori ended up swapping bodys. It's here that the show started to get interesting and I couldn't help but laugh at there predicement. There's many more phenomenons that happen but I won't spoil the laughs and drama for you.\\n\\n\r\nHowever it's the characters that really steal the show in Kokoro Connect. Each character feels well-written and gets an appropriate amount of screentime. Also for every new phenomenon another layer of these characters would be revealed which helped in making sure not everything felt too forced in and those make those emotional moments hit at the right time.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art also are steller across the board in Kokoro Connect. I liked the simple character designs and just how great the animation looked for the whole show. The art also looked fantastic thoughout the whole series and while it isn't going to wow you it looked good enough to stare at some of the artwork once and awhile.\\n\\n\r\nI was really suprised with how much I loved Kokoro Connect. It had a great plot, absolutely fantastic characters, and an excellent blend of drama, mystery, comedy, and even some romance. It's defiently worth a look if you sound interested. Now, if you excuse me I'm off to go watch some more anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe only ratings that really matter to me in the end are the -enjoyment and overall rating so here are mine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nwhen i love something and its one of my favorite shows i wont hesitate to much on giving it a 10. focusing on the good is most important to me, and i really enjoyed this show.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! i hope you're having a great day :)",

The characters are good, imo the story was amazing and  I have never felt more satisfied with an anime's ending. So what can i sayI liked it alot! Oh and I watched the subbed for those considering both, so i suggest doing the same if your afraid of one being terrible. BUT YEAH IF YOUR CONSIDERING IT JUST WATCH IT YOU WON'T REGRET IT!",

            "content": "Story (9)-\r\nKokoro Connect is a an anime based in a high school club consisting of seemingly\"average\" students. When abnormal activity such as mind switching begins to occur between the clubs members unbreakable bonds of friendship, love and despair arise. Complete with humor and nothing gore- ish or explicit this anime is one of my favorites for it's originality and innocence.\r\nArt (9)-\r\nkokoro's animation art is both modern and close to flawless in terms of anime standards. However, I decided to rate this as 7 because it's not creative enough for me -although it is meant to be in the \"slice of life\" genre in terms ofeverything happening outside the club there were no noticeable patterns and not many bright colors (i'm a girl gimme a break) it seemed a little too dark for an upbeat anime in terms of art. The characters were also a bit plain but that may be my opinion after watching so much fantasy action anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8)-\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing distorted, with modern background music that's suitable for each scene and doesn't exaggerate or downgrade the scenes mood. Nothing was really wrong with it however it didn't really stand out that much and personally I really love anime that focus more on music like dubstep and whatnot. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7)-\\n\r\nKokoro connect focuses on 5 protagonists -2 boys, 3 girls. Each character has his/her own perks. In my opinion the main protagonist is Taichi the absolute nice guy. Out of all of the 5 main characters I think that Taichi is the most average however because he is so nice the other characters sometimes tend to \"abuse\" that kindness. This is the reason I rated my enjoyment for this anime a 7. The 5 main characters are the only members in the club that is plagued with abnormal occurrences, although I have mentioned this before, as a result inner conflicts and relationships arise as the anime digs deeper into all of their personal lives.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7)-\\n\r\nAt the time this was the exact anime I was looking for; nothing too crazy and nothing too normal (however I would've preferred maybe a little more craziness). Depending on what your into this anime can rather be an amazing heart stopper or a boring slide show. Personally my enjoyment of the plots idea was probably ranking at 10 however because I thought that the relationships between the characters were all wrong therefore I downgraded the enjoyment rank to a 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8)-\\n\r\nalthough I disliked the characters relationships and some of the characters themselves I was drawn in my the anime's originality in terms of the base idea of abnormal occurrences at a high school secluded to only a few people etc. the art and sound were both modern and suitable and I decided to ignore my own high expectations and suffice for what was there so I had no reason to hate them but no reason to LOVE them resulting in my enjoyment rating being slightly downgraded however overall I gave Kokoro connects... overall... an 8 after balancing out all of the ratings. However this is my first review so this overall may vary between opinions. \\n\\n\r\n -I hope I didn't give out any spoilers  \u2665 \u2665",

The characters are perfect but there are some minor flaws with some of them, most of them you can tell who will go out with who. The characters in my opinion are to easy on the views and I think the directors who whoever was in charge should have added in a plot twist. The anime sound is good but at some points the talking was very quiet and the art wasalso good, but I think the could have done more. The story is BEAST! and I would only change one thing,  that is the way it is told. At some points I felt like they should have put that scene in another episode and things on those lines. This is an anime you should watch and you will probably by the complete series dvd. If you like Angel Beats you will like this anime, it does not as much action like guns like in Angel Beats but it has the same kind of artwork and character development.",

This anime starts off as a most normal, casual anime but pulls a huge, intriguing plot and draws the viewers in. There is no direct plot of this anime but it carries out a different scenario every few episodes and is executed in a refined, high quality way. \r\nThe art style of the anime isn't necessarily super special, excluding the openings and endings. \r\nThe soundtrack to the anime was a bit generic but was used properly when it was needed and helped emphasize the moments that itwas needed, helping each scene get better and better. The openings and endings were also quite subtle and well done. On an extra note: The English Dub was surprisingly well fitting and I thoroughly enjoyed it. \\n\r\nThe characters in this show seemed to be very enjoyable and truly carried their weight while not missing much detail, excluding Oaki. Each character has a small aspect that I felt relate-able with and truly grew to love each and every character, especially Inaba.\\n\r\nOverall, I really did enjoy this anime and it was delightful.",

Love triangles begin, friendshipquarrels happen many times, but their friendship always prevails no matter the struggle. \\n\r\nIt might not seem like much, but so much happens in each episode it makes it unique and intereasting. \\n\r\nYea it is a little short but worth it and it concludes the story nicely in the last four ova's. \\n\r\nIt doesnt have very much humor in it, but a nice intense drama feeling. \\n\r\nHope you enjoy it just as much as I did :3",

            "content": "If you are looking for a nice anime about friendship and romance (notice that friendship comes first), this is it.\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nThe story is about three girls and two guys that have nothing in common spending their school free time in a club they formed for themselves. If that was all to it, it would have been become boring pretty soon, but then something interesting happens. That is the major flaw in this story, as it feels like literally the script writer presented itself as a supernatural entity and spiced the story between the characters using supernatural abilities. The power this entity has and theway it uses it, feels exactly like the author forcing something to happen so the story does not feel dumb and boring. And this entity literally says it does it for an \"entertainment\". Almost all story development relies on this entity. And the entity story goes nowhere, the entity is present for no reason and mostly getting in the way of the actual story, which is about friendship and romance. I would have really appreciated, if the script writer would have not used any supernatural element, but instead used some drama to advance the story. It would have been way more difficult, but the story would have been way more easy to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\r\nThe one thing that saves the show is the characters. They are just a normal students, that if not experiencing any supernatural circumstances, they would have been pretty boring. Therefore, spicing the things between them for no apparent reason does work. No character is extreme, so there is no awkward scenes where the perfect opportunity for romance is missed, because the character is too shy. Everyone act logically with both their minds and emotions. For this reason it is easy to sympathize with the characters and fully immerse in the surrounding emotions.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is good. The characters expressions are nice and the surroundings have sufficient details. But otherwise, the first time I thought about the art is writing this review. Therefore, it is good enough to not notice it, but not good enough to remember it.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are nothing noticeable, I always skipped them. The background music mix well with the atmosphere of the scenes. I like almost everything played by a piano, so I am a bit subjective here, but the effect was nice. However, I do not particularly remember and isolate a specific background music, so it is nothing outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. Seeing the blossom of friendship and romance in a normal way, by talking (not by cherry blossoms, fairies) with characters that one can easily relate. The drama in this series feels forced, as it is mainly forced from the omnipotent entity. However, somehow that never stays in the way of how characters are developed. There is no comedy in this show, but I laughed. There is (almost) no action scenes, but I was thrilled. But most importantly there was friendship and romance that I immersed in and really enjoyed.",

            "content": "In the never-ending stream of anime about high school, there are those which are melodramatic (see Your Lie in April) and those which are slice of life (see Lucky Star). It is very easy to write one without doing the other. Kokoro Connect is a show which attempts to be both melodramatic and also comedic in nature, while also attempting to incorporate an element of surrealism to explore both. Overall, this is fairly well executed, just not without some major kinks along the way. \r\nIn the end, this is a story about a group of friends. A show like this relies heavily on the abilityof the audience to connect with at least one of these characters, and thus benefits from having multiple characters to connect to. I happened to like the three females in the show (Nagase, Inaba, and Yui), and these characters are well developed almost immediately in the show. Thankfully, this development is not of the \"here's my problem, now let's let the main character fix it in five minutes\" variety. You learn more about the female characters as they learn more about themselves, and they grow throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nIn particular, I would applaud the writing for creatively incorporating the surreal elements of the show into the development of the female characters. The show stands out in my mind for that feat alone, as many times the shtick of a plot ends up not having anything to do with how the characters develop. These characters have believable breakdowns and come back together in a way which makes sense.\\n\\n\r\nI was careful to only talk about the female characters here: that's because the two male leads are particularly unmemorable. Taichi, the arguable main protagonist, seems to simply be a conduit for the female characters' love interest through most of the show by having a \"helper\" personality. It's not a harem show, but at points it seems unnervingly like it. Taichi is in a long list of male protagonists like this, but that doesn't excuse this show from having this kind of character. \\n\\n\r\nIn general, the show's plot and characters was often gutsy. The show would sometimes take unexpected and unnatural turns in a completely different direction than the expectation. These moments were pretty well sold as well, and weren't just one-offs. This is appreciated in a genre traversed by so many other anime. This doesn't mean that the plot was perfect (far from it), and sometimes the writing suffered from both lazy writing and the fact that it is a light novel series being adapted to TV.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs were, in general, fairly standard fare. However, I did feel as though this show's detail work on that end were well realized. The character animations were pretty crisp for the time that the show was made, so that was also positive. The backgrounds were slightly jarring though; often they really contrasted to the characters' crisp designs. I often did not really feel like the characters were living in the world at large. In general this is just nitpicking; this type of thing, again, is fairly standard in a genre focused on characters and not setting. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show was fun to watch: Its comedy was hilarious and fairly lewd, and its melodrama was often permeated by real issues with real consequences. It does its best to run the middle line between these two modes, and did a good job without wowing me. If you're looking for a quick laugh or a good cry, this show will do just that.",

You should also not watch the show if you aren't a fan of stories with unexplained phenomena.\r\nI'd definitely recommend the show if you like romance and intense emotional exploration sort of stuff with a little sexy humour sprinkled in.\r\nArt: 4 \r\nThe Art was probably below average. There were a couple of alright moments here and there, but for the most part, it was detrimental to the overall immersion. Emotional scenes where the characters look off just really don't work for me.Personally, I am quite critical of art and animation in films (more-so than most) so keep this in mind.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe appropriate sound was picked throughout. Nothing stood out as phenomenal, but, as is often the case with these things, nothing stood out as out of place and that's what really matters. OP is decent and fits the anime relatively well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nCharacter designs and personalities were quite good for the most part. A few cliches were definitely evident, but stating them would ruin some aspects of the story.  I don't think that the cliches were particularly unwelcomed because the story played on them quite heavily in a unique way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show quite thoroughly overall. It was a good watch, but not a must-watch by any means. It had some very nice and interesting elements to it that made me want to come back from time to time to finish it off.",

            "content": "I chose Kokoro Connect to watch at random, but I had high hopes for it. The story seemed interesting, and it seemed like something I would like. And I was not wrong. I did really like it, but I can't lie and say that I wasn't at all disappointed. Overall, though, it was a great anime.\r\nStory: The story was really good at first. It was interesting and, even though this isn't really a proper describing word, it was pretty spicy up until about the 7th episode. The whole body swapping thing was cliche and common conflict material among animes, but it still entertains me everytime. It's when the unleashing of the desires bit came around that I came to be not-so-impressed. It felt like the same conflict was being repeated over and over, and with no real cause. It was entertaining, yes. I laughed, I cried, my heart was with the characters and what the were feeling, but it was a bit lacking in ways that I can't put into words.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was not spectacular, but it was still really good. I don't have any criticisms for the art at all other than when they were crying, I did not like how they blinked and then their tears like splashed away or something. It was really cringey, to be honest. something I remember really liking about the art, though, was how the girls looked from behind. I really liked how their uniforms looked. It seemed like they were crumpled just enough and it made them look sluchy ikna  good way and I liked that. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was pretty good, but it was also pretty un-amazing. The voice actors were okay, but honestly for Yui's character, I hated the voice. When she cried it sounded like nails ona  chalk board and basically just everything about her voice made me wasnt to run and hide. That's not the voice actors fault, though, it's just my opinion. The theme songs weren't really that memorable either. Basically the sound was good, but not great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were really good. Their backstories were developed well and their personalities were distinct and didn't change throughout the anime which I've noticed happens often in other animes. The only thing I can really criticize is that the romance between Inaba and Taichi was seriously underdeveloped and also Heartseed and Number Two were even more seriously underdeveloped. What were they? How were they related? Where did they come from? Why were they there? How were they doing what they were doing? All questions left unanswered. Perhaps they are answered in the sequel, but I honestly don't care enough to watch the sequel. The characters were great overall, there were just some things that could use a little more background information.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I did enjoy the drama quite a bit, aside from getting a bit bored with the monotony in it. It was a good anime and I would recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Very good",

            "content": "What I didn\u2019t like about the show is the characters. Aoki, Yoshifumi is one dimensional, in his romantic pursuit of Kiriyama, Yui. That is the only aspects of his character explored. Yui is fleshed out and rounded but given her secret it\u2019s vexing to see her associate with Aoki in any capacity. Nagase, Iori is an okay character but her angst was childish and tiresome to watch after the first arc. But I can have that opinion as a grown man who long ago came to terms with his angst. Yaegashi, Taichi has the \u2018dive in head first to save others\u2019 personality that ensures eventsreach a head. And Inaba, Himeko is overtly the best character in the show because her reactions and motivations were the most realistic and relatable; given the extraordinary scenario.\\n\r\nIt was relatable and thought provoking because it was It forced the characters to face moral decisions they wouldn\u2019t ordinarily face. I liked how the series played with the idea of aberrant behaviour being genuine or forced. It preys on fears that each and every human being has as it raises the questions of \u2018what would you do if\u2026\u2019and \u2018how would you react if\u2026\u2019 while understanding morality is a subjective thing. It was neither boring nor predictable because the story is fast paced dishing out information as needed to the viewer and characters, because when the viewer has more information than the characters the story becomes predictable. And predictable equals boring. I liked that the series runs the gambit of emotions; it\u2019s funny, sad and dramatic. \\n",

            "content": "Alright guys, another slice of life/romance/mystery/comedy anime! It's quite hard for me to put this anime into any one hard category since it encompasses so many different aspects, but this is what makes this series so amazing and worth watching.\r\nFor a very brief synopsis: The story is about 5 first-year high school students who have all sorts of havoc wreaked on their lives by a mystical figure. \r\nStory: 10. The plot (and characters) is what completely sold me on this series. The plot is lighthearted, suspenseful, tragic, and unique in all the right places. \r\nArt: 6. It's mostly generic. The art doesn't stand out tome in any way (unlike kyoani's or shaft's if you want to see my baseline for a high score for art). \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7. There were times where the voice acting didn't really line up with what was being presented visually at times which bothered me a bit. However, it didn't take away from the series as a whole, and, on the other hand, the voice actors did a good job in distinguishing between each person as they switched people (mild spoiler but it's in the first episode anyways) which really impressed me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8. Some were a bit cliche, some developed in amazing ways. The characters and their development as a whole portrays to the audience firstly the importance of friends and other themes as well (which I won't spoil, but trust me they're good and took me many years to learn myself). Another plus is that the characters aren't too stereotypical and that were not very one-dimensional (unlike many slice of life series). I can't say too much about the characters or else I'd be spoiling the series, so go watch it and see for yourself!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10. I loved every single part. There were parts where I wanted to cry and others that wanted to make me laugh. There aren't that many series that could genuinely make me do that within the same episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9. Guys. This. Series. Is. Amazing. One point docked for problems with the sound that I've outlined and mediocre art because I like to be picky especially with a series that has an amazing story and plot. If you haven't watched it, you really haven't lived life, and I don't mean that lightly. This series will definitely impart some good life lessons the easy way (unlike the hard way in my life unfortunately). \\n\\n\r\nIf anyone hasn't watched this series or isn't sure if they should, watch it! I'm personally quite picky when it comes to which series I should watch and don't take BS or fluff quite well, so that says something about this series. I hope this review has convinced some or all of you into watching (or bingeing) Kokoro Connect.",

            "content": "(This review takes into account the final 4 episodes as well.)\r\n     To start off, I am a sucker for shows that deal with swapping bodies.  This series was no exception.  Without giving away anything too much, I also liked how they changed to different phenomenon other than body swapping. \r\n     The characters I really liked as well.  While some of them seem to exude a lot of the cookie-cutter anime tropes that get old quick, they managed to pull the audience in with more depth to their dilemmas (especially in the case of Irori.)The usage of numerous phenomena to reveal backstory and character traits, I thought was a very clever way of introducing the audience to the characters.  \\n\r\n     My favorite aspect of this show was Inaba.  Even if there were times when I thought the series used tired tropes from slice-of-life anime, I could always expect that they'd use this character to pretty much speak my thoughts and be the voice of reason when the other characters were being too irrational and stereotypical of this genre of anime.  When I first started watching this series, I was just thinking the whole time \"oh my goodness, Inaba is basically who I'd be if I was a cute anime girl.\"\\n\r\n    I thought the main villain was also handled very well.  He appears at random moments inhabiting peoples bodies whenever he feels like it, and it always comes across as being super creepy and weird because you don't know what he is or why he's causing so much havoc with these characters.\\n\r\n     If there's anything I think they could've changed, I think maybe they could've set up the characters in a less rushed fashion at the beginning and then had them swap bodies.  From my experience watching American cartoons all my life, I can easily say the body swapping trope only works great if you've already firmly established the characters regardless of what kind of show you're watching.\\n\r\n     Overall, I'd say this show was very good.  Not perfect by any means, but still very enjoyable if you like slice-of-life anime with a bit of a creative spin to it.\\n\\n\r\n(Also, the music in this was top notch.  Probably the first anime I've seen where the music really stuck out to me.)",

            "content": "Kokoro Connect has to be up near the top of the list of favorite anime's I've watched so far. I don't normally see this anime on any 'lists' for good animes and wasn't really drawn to it but I'm glad I gave it a chance! SPOILERS AHEAD!\r\nStory 9/10: The plot kind of reminded me of Yamada and the Seven witches but it was also different on itself aswell. I loved this plot and it was awesome to watch 5 people deal with this problem and conquer it aswell. I don't feel there was enough backstory added to each person and would of loved to seealot more of this because I love a good backstory! But the story line was well put together even though it became kind of repetitive.. There's a problem, one person is affected by it on a whole different level, arguments, then boom it's all fixed with basically no problems about it in the future! The romance in the series is fairly balanced with the plot.. I'm mostly drawn to romantic type animes and this definitely hit a home run for me. I'm glad they went that way with Inaba and Taichi instead of the other girl. Even though in the first two episodes I was rooting for Iori I was able to see that Inaba liked Taichi from the beginning and it made for a interesting love triangle! Would of loved to see a season 2 but they ended the entire thing on a high note and I respect them for that! They gave the fans the happy ending!\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: Art seemed very good for the series and wouldn't expect less! Everything looked good even though some of the walking parts looked abit weird to me I still think it turned out well!\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: I enjoyed every bit of detail added in for music and sounds in the series.. Even though some parts of the series would have 0 music when it was a sad/loving moment it made it kind of weird not hearing anything!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: The main character is fairly decent and I really enjoyed they didn't make it into one of those series where if a character gets embarrassed they don't do a bunch of back flips/arm waving about! Each character was fairly decent and it was good to see a whole bunch of different people come together! Each character had they burdens to bare and it made for an enjoyable watch. Pretty sure I'm not the only one but I would of loved to learn more about heartseed!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: I really enjoyed the series as a whole, I don't read manga as I find them boring and wouldn't be as attached as a series but I'd love a season 2 to see the aftermath of them in college/the real life and suddenly Heartseed pops up and drops another phenomenon! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I really enjoyed it and would highly recommended it to anyone whose looking for a good romance/plot story which has a happy ending!",

            "content": "People are complex beings. We are defined by our interests, memories and the ways we behave to other people. Each human has different patterns of personality - many weaknesses, but also strong points and uniquenesses. The idea of personality is the main subject of the series, and surprisingly, it is executed really well.\r\nThe story of the series is about the 5 members of the Cultural Research Club, who find themselves switching bodies with each other. The body switching is just the first of many supernatural phenomenons they have to deal with. Naturally, they get to know other very closely, and conflicts arise. Will their friendshipstand this?\\n\r\nThe story is really well written and interesting. It has drama (which was most of the times carefully made), slice-of-life theme, and even some comedy.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the best aspect of the show is undoubtabley its characters. Although they might look one-dimensional in the start, soon you get to know them more closely, and realize that they are not so \"perfect\" as they seem. For example - Yaegashi Taichi, who is a \"selfless freak\" who always helps anyone as much as he can, is actually a selfish person who can't stand seeing people hurt. The characters sometimes overreact to things and get depressed - just like in real life. There is a lot of character development, which makes the story even better. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are still drawbacks. First of all - there are a few ecchi scenes (especially in the first chapter), and in my opinion they were totally pointless and irritating. Another main drawback is the reasoning. The supernatural things just happen. Why? This question is never really answered. The reason \"Because you are just a little bit too interesting\" is not satisfying. Some of the scenes were made just to add drama, but it doesn't mean they are bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is nice and simple - the character designs and the scenery are very well made. The background music adds to the atmosphere of the anime, and most of the OP and ED themes (there are 4...) are very good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a series that deals mainly with friendship and people's personality. The story is very well written and is quite unique; It has drama, but it is not exaggerated. If you search for a series with supernatural and slight-of-life themes with good drama, I suggest you to try this one.",

            "content": "Also including the 'OVA's' here.\r\nAnother anime to succesfuy make me cry! Twice! And the first time was at ep 5!!!\r\nYou think this will be your casual school life, romance anime with some supernatural bit and some life lessons. Well, you're wrong. In the very beginning it hits you with feels and drama and by the middle you're so deep into the darkness and feels that you start suffocating.\r\nIt has it's light moments, of course. Comedy is pretty good there and I laughed quite a lot. \r\nWhat it does the best is character development. Personally, I could relate to three of the characters - Nagase, Inabaand Taichi and some of their problems are known to me. This anime does a great letting characters overcome their problems not in just one arc but in the whole anime and not letting their problems be easily solved  - it takes tears and pain and help from others to finally overcome them.\\n\\n\r\nTwo things I weren't very happy with:\\n\r\n1) only 17 episodes. I hear that it was planned to make 24 but something happened and it never got finished. Because of that we never truly saw SPOIERS Aoki x Yui sail or understood anything about Heartseeds or why was the phenomenom even there in the first place.\\n\r\n2)Nagase Iori. Yes, I could soemtimes relate to her and I understood her but by the end of the anime she got a little, well, annoying. Might be because of my impatence and the fact that I'm easily annoyed but... Every arc was basically about Nagase's problems and in the background, someone else's. What I decided in the end was that Nagase was probably *the* main MC in this whole anime because her character developed the most, she had the deepest problems + in the ending song (well at least one), she's the only one who is shown.\\n\\n\r\nSORRY FOR IT BEING LONG AGAIN GEEZ I SHOULD STOP",

In a way, it develops the characters by how the plot evolves.  The characters in it self could have been presented on a more deeper level, considering how the plot line drags them along and how serious some of the issues presented can be.  \r\nIf you like romance, it has it but it isn't presented in a typical fashion but in such a way that it is dragged out of the characters fromwhat happens in their supernatural-yet-not-really type story plot. \\n\\n\r\nIt is I guess a slice of life type story but the phenomenas' that happen kinda tear it down piece by piece.

They kept bolstering this anime one sushi roll after the next, that one and Haikyuu!!, until finally I began seeing the light in their eyes and decided to give it a shot!\r\nThis anime hits the feels very well, by taking the viewer through a roller coaster of emotions within each character's mind. The synopsis of the anime, if you haven't read the description, is that five characters switch bodies and are forced to live each other's lives for ashort time. Of course the guy receiving a girl's body is going to end up causing some juicy content to occur, but it's not all just nice legs here. The anime goes really in-depth displaying each character's emotions and providing an OMEGA background story for each character.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone has their troubles, and it's fair to say that high school is the worst (I mean best) time to begin learning about yourself and the other people around you. I must admit that I felt those fun bubbly emotions inside when the romance knob was turned on high. If you don't know what I mean, to all of you guys out there, those are the strange feelings of cute bunnies that you feel in your stomach when you're happy. For the girls, well, what do girls feel like inside?\\n\\n\r\nMy point is that this anime has a lot of rich content and it shouldn't be passed over with the flick of a brow and a click of a mouse (not a real mouse). You are bound to enjoy this anime under one condition. You put yourself in that character's shoes and REALLY, and I mean actually do this, REALLY imagine what it would be like to be forced to live the life that they do.\\n\\n\r\nGood luck and many thanks for reading. Here are the ratings:\\n\r\nStory - 8 - The story is split up into numerous different missions that the group must complete before moving on. It's like a video game, minus blood gushing monsters and luscious babes to greet you as a reward. The only real purpose is that everyone in the group lives happily ever after.\\n\r\nGraphics - 9 - Bright and shiny artwork followed by the occasional super detailed character movement using 2x frame rate. The characters were aesthetically pleasing, which is always nice on the eyes, as well as I enjoyed sitting back, relaxing, and watching every scene just because.   \\n\r\nSoundtrack - 10 - Really, really happy sound tracks used for touching moments, and fun action sound tracks used for intense scenes/battles. As well, tracks were done for very sad and emotional times.\\n\r\nCharacter development - 10 - This anime is all about character development. In fact, every character goes through such a roller coaster that I give them each a new respect by the time all of the wounds are patched up.\\n\r\nCharacter voiceovers - 10 - I watched in Japanese and found that 4/5 of the characters had very.. no I'll take that back. All 5 did an extremely good job of changing tones when necessary and fulfilling their roll.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\nRecommended - Absolutely. What a treat!",

            "content": "This is not going to be the super long types of review, but I'm writing it anyways. I guess I have some words and thoughts to put off my chest. \r\nThis anime is really awesome, and I mean it in every sense (just look at the scores I gave). Very few anime can adapt a light novel based story and plot that well; the execution in this series is just golden. Seriously, the perfect mix of light-hearted moments and tense situations greatly elevates my experience watching it. Moreover, the delicate balance between plot progression and character development is well achieved. Unlike many series these days,this series is arguably compact, you won't catch yourself wanting the series to be faster. However, it also sparred a good amount of time just adding some little details to the plot (be it conversations, thoughts or additional scenes) which allows for great character development.  This means having 4 arcs in just 17 episodes (yeah, I know, it sounds insane), but with characters you can relate to on a deep level thanks to the abundance of character development. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, if you are considering this series, please just watch it, I can guarantee it is worth every minute of yours. \\n\\n\r\nThen again, each series have their own flaws, and so does this. However, it is one very tiny detail that I don't think it deserves to be called a flaw, but it sure is a hole that I fail to overlook. This series is so satisfying that I am actually going over the little details one would not even give any attention to for series which are badly done. \\n\\n\r\n******* SPOILER ALERT ************ PERSONAL RANT ALERT ******\\n\\n\r\nThis weakness, to put it simply, is the lack of scenes and situations that allow us viewers to have a better grasp the change in Iori's personality.  Yes we know that she no longer compares herself to what is called as \"normal\" and what is \"ideal\", and that these points are well illustrated. But, we are not shown a few things. First, how her thoughts have changed, if any.  During the 4th arc, we know that she has some pretty dark and negative thoughts. But if she really decides later on to not give a damn about wanting to be someone she is not, does that mean she becomes the cold and dark person her thoughts probe her to be? No, she kinda got back to cheery Iori, kinda, at least. Then does that mean she changed how she thinks?! Unfortunately, we don't know.\\n\\n\r\nAnd you may ask why this matters so much that without writing this, I am probably going to have a sleepless night, I mean, the story was good, right? Well yeah, but this has its implications. By only telling us that she no longer wants to try too hard to become her ideal self, we don't see to the full extent of how she has changed. We were not given any chance to really compare the old Iori vs the new Iori. We are confused over what really changed. And the implication that I can't get over with is the relationship between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nYes, we get it that the love between Iori and Taichi was innocent and naive (like how someone lost would fall in love with their savior), but I just really wished that more details on that were given. Like how does Iori feel about Taichi after everything that has happened? How does Iori think of having her best friend date Taichi? Just the process of moving on from liking someone to another person was not done as well as when Aoki moved on from Nana to Yui. And given that it did not take super long to show us how Aoki moved on, it would probably be very viable for these details to be added  in a couple of minutes. After all, the execution of this anime is golden. It is a real waste, as the lack of details makes me a tiny bit confused. And this made me fail to fully accept the TaichiXInaba route taken. After all, the plot has strongly convinced me to support the TaichiXIori route. So yes, it all came down to the little disappointment in me towards the ending. And yes, I may be the only one thinking about this small, tiny detail, but regardless, just a little better presentation during the ending episode would really have boosted my overall perception of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have read all the way....thank you very much, you are a very patient person, and you are awesome for lending me your ears (more like eyes actually). I will still firmly say that this is an AMAZING series, and that small lack in details would not change the fact that it is good, but legendary series end with a bang (meaning a great level of satisfaction), and thus the 9 instead of 10 for the overall score. Call me irrational, well, you are probably correct, but I just can't ignore the part of me who is annoyed by the ending ;)\\n\\n",

            "content": "-THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS-\r\nKokoro Connect is a supernatural anime with a sense of humor, a developing romance, and a heart-warming romance.\r\nIt's about 5 high school students with ordinary lives, but not until a supernatural force decides to toy with them just a little. \r\nWhat would happen when Taichi Yaegashi, Iori Nagase, Himeko Inaba, Yui Kiriyama and Yushifumi Aoki begin to switch bodies? What would happen if their darkest desires are unleashed and out on the table? What would happen when feelings of love arise between them? Would that bring them closer? Or just drive them apart?\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nKokoro Connect flowed smoothly without rushing or beingawfully slow-paced, not to mention that it fulfilled its role perfectly in its genre, KC proved that a little bit of humor and a touch of romance could NEVER spoil a supernatural anime, they just add spice and excitement to the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: +10\\n\r\nThe characters are what really MADE Kokoro Connect, they were all well-developed, they all experienced major plot twists that changed them and made the anime entertaining to watch. My favorite character was indeed, The one and only, Yui Kiriyama. I guarantee that those characters will leave a mark in your heart. M\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 10\\n\r\nI simply adored the art style, if you had seen Hyouka or K-on!, this style would be familiar. It was easy for the eyes to watch and the movements were all crisp. The OP&ED were so adorable and catchy, I could listen to them on repeat for a week and not get bored.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime left a mark in my heart, and I don't think I will ever forget it. It made me feel butterflies, and for the second time I mention my admiration for Yui Kiriyama, this girl was so moe and heart-warming. Just go watch it, You won't regret it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I never really write reviews so go easy on me if you don't think it's \"professionally\" written. As of the first day of 2013, the last four episodes of Kokoro Connect were leaked, and I thought I had to wait until March 2013 like the news said. Anyways,\r\nStory:\r\nYou have 5 friends in the Cultural Research Club. Sounds like your typical high school friends or slice of life anime right? Well it is, kind of. A man by the name of balloon vine decides to show himself to the group. He puts them through various \"phenomena\" mentally. At first I had no idea what was goingon, nor thought it was interesting enough. I only found it funny at first. As the story goes on, more interesting things happen and it really sucks you in. Between the relationships inside the group and the challenges set by Balloon Vine, the story really picks up and becomes amazing.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I loved about the show was the art. The way they were drawn reminds me of K-on in a way but a bit more detailed. I liked it a lot.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe background music during the scenes and the 2nd ending are the ones that stood out to me. The background music really set the mood during the good and bad times. The 2nd end theme doesn't quite match the show but it's one of my favorite ending themes of all the anime I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nYou have the wrestling fanatic who tries to put everything on himself, the guy who's expresses his love to the same girl but gets rejected, the girl who rejects the guy and she loves everything cute, the bossy yet smart girl who is computer savvy, and the girl whom everybody loves. Really does sound like your typical high school life anime, but each character has their own time to shine and each one of them are so individualistically great and have their own flaws as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed almost every bit of it. The good, the funny, the sad and the bad parts are all enjoyable. You can't tell how love I've been waiting for the last episodes to come out, that's just how much I enjoyed it. A very heart warming, comedic, and great anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this show to anyone who loves to watch the slice of life genre. It's pretty high up there in my opinion with an original kind of plot and it also has it's own concept as far as dealing with it's story. So many twists and moments you will love.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This will also be including the 4 episode OVA ending sequel and might include small amount of spoilers, all small details.\r\nHave you ever had that one anime that hits you right in the logical boundary where you start to question how you would truly react if that particular situation were to happen to you? Well, this show made me think and reevaluate how i would hold up if I were one of the main characters, and my own philosophy made it a day long thing. Anyway, welcome to Kokoro Connect, where you can easily be swept up in the laughter, happiness, and of coursethe feels.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\n The story behind Kokoro Connect is that on a very average day, a club full of 5 friends start experiencing something weird going on. When I say weird I mean switching bodies kind of weird. This is all due to a supernatural being named Heart Seed out of nowhere got bored, and decided to screw with some humans just for his pure amusement, which is kind of a dick move in my opinion, but hey im not completely judging, okay maybe a little. The story takes a good hard look behind the way that a unnatural phenomenon in between very close friends can make any water that was quelled in the past start to seem a bit choppy and divided. The story for all it is worth was well written and well versed in dialogue that all of the story is understood quite easily and beautifully. The main brilliance goes mainly into the characters and their different faults, because we as humans do have those even if a little or many.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\n I'm going to start off by saying that the characters I think made the show what it is and what you should expect it to be. With that being said, all of the characters work so well with each other to instill either comedy or drama into our experience due to all the conflicting personalities and emotions, from the typical nice-help-everyone type of guy Taichi, to the super-hyper Iori, to the strict Inaba, to the expressive Yui, and finally, Mr calm, cool, and collected Aoki. The main conflict is that you can never know what a person truly is until put into a bad situation, some change, some don't, and that's kind of the gist of what this show presents the characters with. The thing I like most about the show is that even though it is 17 episodes (including OVA), it presents the story and plot points in such a way that it moves quicker than some other slice-of-life shows feel with 24-26 episodes. In my opinion, there is not a character that I can say that I have disliked even the trouble making Heart Seed, even though he started all the nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 \\n\r\nThe art was very fundamental to the story in that it doesn't restrict the character personal outlay and movements that would take away from the experience from small changes on their faces to grand movements and gestures that Iori loves to do. The color span is colorful and refreshing even among the advancements in animation in the new line of shows coming out recently.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 I personally had a neutral reaction with the opening and ending, but what I liked about the music is that it matches the feeling you should be preparing yourself for before the episode comes on and tries to lighten or lift up your dampened spirits from the day you just had to put you in the right mindset to get right back into the kokoro connect world.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 \\n\r\nI loved almost every part of this show from the music to story to characters, Starchild records worked really well together to portray the intensity of what the manga was trying to lay down. I couldn't stop after the first episode, it drew me in and wouldn't let me go. If I had to pick one thing that I liked about the show is the raw emotion that they had each character portray in their own way. My enjoyment was from the start and beginning with Aoki, he was my favorite character because he is the calm and collected that I represent myself as to people that know me, and he is probably one of the main reasons that I liked this show as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 \\n\r\nAll in all, this show is meant for anyone who enjoyed shows like Golden Time, or, at an extreme perspective, Wandering Son. This show brings to the front line of slice of life anime a story line that will provide intrigue, comedy, and maybe a few hidden tears. If you are even the slightest bit interested in the idea of this show, then you shouldn't wait a minute more to start enjoying this twist on a topic that is kind of tip toed around in modern shows.",

One day they encounter a bizarre phenomenon when Aoki and Yui switch bodies without warning.

After a good amount of the episodes, my enjoyment slacked a little, Just felt the Phenomena was a little \"Rinse and Repeated\" too much  and lost its unique factor, don't get me wrong it still worked and those latter episodes were worth watching but felt dragged out a little and by the end of episode 13 left it open for those \"Extra\" Episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum this up, Unique story and great cast of characters, Each one a little different from the rest, I love the whole self journey which is in this series, But nearer the later parts of the series (Up to 13) it did feel a little dragged on or even some might say a little \"Filler\" ish.\\n\r\nBUT This is still a very good series, and something i would highly recommend.\\n\\n\r\n(Would of got a 9, was very close, but the enjoyment slacked off during the later episodes.)",

            "content": "Story: 8/10\r\n\tWhen I first decided to check out Kokoro Connect all I really knew about the show was that it was about a group of friends that switch bodies from time to time, and that premise has always been very intriguing to me. The possible consequences and repercussions, plus the story writing possibilities of this topic seem untapped, or maybe any film or tv show I\u2019ve seen try this topic are either contained to a single episode, or are just done very poorly. Now did Kokoro Connect go above and beyond the other media I\u2019ve seen tackle this subject\u2026 hhmmmmmmmmm...I would say yes and no.They do going into the psychological effects of switching personalities/bodies with others, but  how they are put into this situation and how it is explained was done rather shoddily. They don\u2019t explain anything, I mean they know that a being named Heartseed is forcing them to switch personalities, then there are forced to give into any thought are impulse they have, then their thoughts are transmitted to each other, and they switch topics so often that it just becomes annoying, that nothing is really resolved, and that each new problem because their friendship/club to become worse and worse off, totally breaking a couple of the characters. And the ending feels just like another transition between the different Heartseed situations arcs, instead of satisfying ending that brings closure to character relationships. Still the premise of the show is really intriguing, and the show can be quite enticing at times, when you\u2019re watching the five friends deal with these supernatural situations and how it can ruin their relationships, and have them question their personality and ideologies. The story and premise it actually great, it\u2019s just that some of the execution and lack of detail involving heartseed was a bit disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nTaichi Yaegashi is a pro wrestling fanatic, who loves to help people out, and has most girls in his club vying for his affection. His ideologies are pretty much the exact same as Shiro\u2019s from the Fate series, and for both of them the characters that surround them attack this notion of putting everyone else before yourself. Going as far to call Taichi selfless freak, which is harsh. I mean we do everything for reason so it's possible to see all our actions as selfish, but Taichi just really seems to want to make others around him happy, and overall he always seems to seem the most calm and collected when shit starts to hit the fan. Still I find him to be a bland main character, who doesn\u2019t change all the much despite the huge life-changing events that occur to him. \\n\\n\r\nIori Nagase always walked a thin line tettering between my favorite and least favorite character on Kokoro Connect. On one hand initially the type of personality she initially puts off is one that's bubbly and cheerful and Taichi falls for that aspect of her personality. But then she starts to question what her actual personality even is, when she starts to fear that her constant switching of personalities to suit the ones around her has caused her to lose her way, and not be able to understand who the true Iori Nagase is. For a while she was just pissing me off, because she took what seemed like forever to get over this personality problem, but over time I came to appreciate the type of deep personal questions she asked of others and herself, like how they could know the real Iori Nagase, like would they like her if she didn;t have to keep up a high standard of being happy and cheerful to everyone all the time. Her development is really unique, and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve seen a character transition in anime done as well as it was done with Iori. Still she has some stiff competition with Himeko.\\n\\n\r\nHimeko Inaba is the most cool and controlled member of the Cultural Research Club. She is very hard on the guy members of the group, and isn\u2019t very trusting of other, but her wit and sarcastic sense of humor was very enjoyable, and her budding relationship with Taichi was the one I wanted to come true the most. She is just so forward and blunt when she wants to be and that confidence in her character displayed by most of her actions is quite admirable. The other two characters that are part of the CRC aren\u2019t nearly as interesting so I won\u2019t really go into each of their individual personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation/Art Style: (5/10) Music: (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nNeither are amazing or poor, they are both par for the course so, I really don\u2019t know how to explain average art styles or OSTs anymore. I feel like for most series I\u2019ve been reviewing lately neither the animation nor music, have been all that memorable which saddens me since I feel like I\u2019ve been regurgitating a few choice words over and over again.  I mean the character designs are pretty moe, but I\u2019m not even sure if that is good thing anymore to be honest. I mean after watching K-On! What is even the point of using moe characters anymore, everything that looks moe to me just reminds me of K-On! Which reminds me that I should probably check out season 2 eventually, though I\u2019m not sure how it will be able to fare better than the first season. The Opening is a jaunty little tune, that has me picturing a beautiful seaside view during the day. The song is a little melodramatic and undercooked for my taste, but I can\u2019t really complain about it either. It is just a nice little relaxing theme.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nKokoro connect definitely has its flaws, but that isn\u2019t what I\u2019ll remember about Kokoro after not seeing it for a few years. What I will remember will be the intriguing premise coupled along with a couple fantastic female leads, with a ton of stunning character development compared to what I\u2019ve seen from most slice-of-life shows. Definitely check out Kokoro Connect, even if you aren\u2019t a fan of its cutesy demeanor, the premise alone is enough to give this show a look.",

            "content": "I started watching this anime based solely on its (admittedly clich\u00e9) premise\u2014a group of first-year high-school students suddenly start swapping bodies amongst themselves.  However, much to my surprise, I ended up loving it.  It\u2019s not only the best show I\u2019ve seen so far from anime studio Silver Link but also, in my opinion, one of the most overlooked animes from 2012.  \r\nIf I were to compare Kokoro Connect to other animes, it\u2019s like a cross between Hyouka (a narrative divided into multi-episode \u201cmystery\u201d arcs) and The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (five students in a made-up after-school club dealing with unexplained, supernatural phenomena).The obvious parallels to the latter series might lead some viewers to offhandedly dismiss Kokoro Connect as just another light novel adaptation trying to cash in on the mega-success of Haruhi Suzumiya.  In response to this sentiment, let me note that even if Kokoro Connect was heavily inspired by Haruhi Suzumiya, there is nothing wrong with a series \u201cripping off\u201d another series as long as the rip-off is bringing something new to the table.  For example, while Log Horizon (a show I adore) is often labeled a rip-off of Sword Art Online, the two shows are nothing alike with respect to how they approach the \u201ccharacters stuck in a video game\u201d trope.  Also, SAO did not spontaneously invent this trope; it was already well-established long before SAO came along, by works such as Tron and .hack//Sign.  All I\u2019m saying is that a show can take an unoriginal concept\u2014here, high-schoolers dealing with body-swapping and other supernatural shenanigans\u2014and, through intelligent execution, produce something unique and memorable.  In fact, I actually enjoyed Kokoro Connect more than both seasons of Haruhi Suzumiya (though the latter franchise still wins by virtue of the film The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya).  \\n\\n\r\nKokoro Connect centers on the five members of the Student Cultural Research Club: \u201cmain character\u201d Taichi (a pro wrestling fan with a white-knight complex), actual main character Iori (whose chipper, bubbly persona masks something darker and more cynical), best girl Inaba (a snarky computer nerd voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro, who turns in yet another brilliant performance), second-best girl Yui (whose petite physique belies her skill at karate), and best friend Aoki (a happy-go-lucky goofball in love with Yui).  The characters have excellent chemistry with each other, particularly Taichi and Yui (probably my favorite platonic boy-girl relationship in any anime I\u2019ve seen).   \\n\\n\r\nThe narrative progresses in a way that gives each character a chance to enjoy the spotlight as well as undergo meaningful development.  Indeed, one of the things I liked most about Kokoro Connect is how well it used its various supernatural \u201cintrusions\u201d to facilitate this character growth.  The anime also does an admirable job depicting these characters as awkward, horny teenagers who, despite their claims to the contrary, have no idea what they\u2019re doing or what they really want.  These attempts at realism help counterbalance the show\u2019s fantasy setup and make the characters much more relatable than those in other high school-set anime I\u2019ve seen, which includes Hyouka (its cast, while likeable, can sometimes come across as overly one-note or idealized).  \\n\\n\r\nKokoro Connect does have some problems, though I wouldn\u2019t label any of them as major.  The animation is very average, especially when compared to the masterful art direction in Hyouka (which, I should note, came out the same year as Kokoro Connect).  With its cookie-cutter character designs and rather drab color palette, Kokoro Connect more closely resembles a show produced by A-1 Pictures than Silver Link, which is disappointing given how most Silver Link shows make an effort to integrate a sense of vibrancy and visual playfulness into their respective animation styles.  While the soundtrack is pretty good, they reuse certain tracks quite a bit and neither OP is particularly memorable.  On the other hand, I liked how the show introduced a new ED for each of the four story arcs (I'd say the first ED is my favorite of the bunch).  \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of story, I\u2019m not usually a fan of love triangles or white-knight characters; however, I feel Kokoro Connect handled both elements fairly well: the love triangle produces a satisfying payoff in the final arc, and Taichi\u2019s self-awareness mitigates his infuriating instinct to \u201csave everyone\u201d (which is more than I can say about Shiro Emiya from Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works).  Some of the more emotional moments in the series can get heavy-handed as they drag on, though for the most part the drama manages to hit home.  (Also, I should note that the show has a fair number of laugh-out-loud moments, such as the \u201csister kiss\u201d in episode 16, which had me on the floor rolling.)  Finally, the show doesn\u2019t ever definitively explain the reasons behind the supernatural incidents that occur throughout the series, and while I personally didn\u2019t mind this lack of closure I can imagine it might frustrate some viewers. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kokoro Connect is an enjoyable 9/10 show with a great cast, interesting story, and good mixture of humor and drama.  Please be aware, however, that the series is actually 17 episodes long, with the final 4 episodes released as OVAs after the first 13 episodes.  Together, these 4 episodes form what I consider to be the strongest arc of the series, wrapping up the show beautifully while also leaving the door open for a Season 2 (which, at this point, likely isn\u2019t going to happen).",

            "content": "Compared with my ramble on the rating system and the long-ish review on Erased I will try and make this a bit shorter. I find that purposely overloaded reviews have a negative impact and I myself struggle finishing them when reading so here we go:\r\nI believe I have avoided spoilers but take care if you see an indication that I may have done differently. This is a review based on the overall impact of the story rather than a breakdown of things like animation/sounds and such. This is just more of my thing as everything is subjective therefore I will not tell you that theart is mediocre or not as that is not something for me to judge unless I see visible errors in the art/sound.\\n\\n\r\nKokoro Connect is everything one can expect from both the obvious name of the anime as well as the genre which is, don't even wait for it..... high-school drama.\\n\r\nIf you are in the market for this type of an anime then this will be right up your alley as Kokoroco(written as such on MAL which is kind of shorter) does little to stray from the recipe. Don't get me wrong I find that using a similar formula can indeed result in a somewhat unique anime if enough effort is put into it and I think this one falls right into that category.\\n\\n\r\nKokoroco introduces 5 students to us who are members of the same club. The club activities are completely irrelevant as the characters spend the entire anime dealing with their problems. The problems consist of both their relationships and the introduction of a third party that messes with their emotions and subsequently relationships for some unknown reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationships between the characters are prettty obvious from the very first episodes but that should be taken as a good point in terms on an anime with 17 episodes (including the OVAs that are directly tied to the main shows plot). We have the classic outgoing guy (Aoki) who always expresses himself openly who is in love with a girl that is completely rejecting him at the start (due to some circumstances from her past). This unfolds into a pretty basic pattern of \"I will say I love you till you do the same\" and so on and so forth. This relationship formula is pretty basic but nonetheless interesting to observe as both of the characters (as usual) uncover their troubled pasts to each other and eventually move along with their lives. \\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship is however basically just a sidetrack to the more prominent one which is.... a moment of forced suspense kek: a love triangle!! Wew lad that is indeed a shocking revelation.\\n\\n\r\nEnough with the sarcasm though. The remaining 3 characters Iori(the cheerful one with a troubled past), Inaba(tsundere) and Taichi(ye olde I will help and save everyone so they all love me guy) form a love triangle of sorts where both girls acknowledge the others efforts and still remain friends. Or do they? This is one of the sources of friction and what we came in here for in the first place: Drama ladies and gentlemen. Is the drama good though? Depends. From the perspective of a 25 year old working male that has little(almost none) experience in relationships I still feel like the drama was blown out of proportions at some points which can by some current memers considered a pretty cringe moment. Indeed I have felt a bit embarassed by some of the situations as from a grown up (to a certain extent) perspective the most I could fathom is that the character of Iori and Inaba who are central to the drama were basically just trying to find what they should do in life. The notion of people wearing masks and lying and acting differently is portrayed as something horrific that destroys one identity but in fact  it is a well known common practice for humans as social beings. Every day we adapt to our surroundings to get what we want or to avoid things we don't. Seeing a person struggle to the point of mental breakdown from a completely normal social phenomenon was kind of awkward for me to watch. In the end the characters realized the most obvious truth > to be yourself just do what you want be that something that adheres to others wishes or to yours. It took the show quite a while to come to this simple conclusion but that can be understood as the process of growing up for the young teenagers. I understood this show more of a drama about growing up rather than love even though its presence is undeniable.\\n\\n\r\nWithout further ado I will say the following: Kokoroco is a classic highschool drama that introduces a supernatural element (boy that is new haHaa) that messes up the relationships or maybe even kickstarts them from a certain perspective. The MAL synopsis is misleading as the personality exchange is just one of several issue they face and the last one seemed to me like the most influential one so don't believe that switching bodies is the only thing there is to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe show ended on a rather positive note but I would expect people to get angry over the pairing that has happened. In any case I believe the ending was pretty clear from the way the show was heading and my overall enjoyment was not impaired by it in any way.\\n\r\nThis anime tugs on your heart strings at some points but at least it does not do so using cheap albeit usual methods. It will not make your jaw drop from sudden plot twists although there are some present. Taking into account that these characters are still young their patter of behavior is easily predictable. The supernatural element introduced serves as a sort of ignition fo start the drama and force the characters in situations where they have to confront their feelings. This causes a lot of friction which is exactly what we wanted no?\\n\\n\r\nIn any case Kokoroco is a good watch that will not break any walls down but it definitely gave me what I came to it for. It was a full fledged-drama full of mistakes/fixes and relationship troubles presented in a casual, very inviting sort of way that does not make the viewer question the integrity of the show. A solid 8 in my book.\\n\\n\r\nLook at me writing a short review here.... I should stop. Thanks for reading.",

            "content": "At first the anime seems like a typical slice of life anime following a group of high schoolers in the media club. All this is abruptly changed when balloon vine (allow known as heart seed and various other translations) comes along. The story starts slow and is arguably stays slow till the end.\r\nWhat drew me to this anime in the first place was the art style of the anime. It's by the same producers as K-ON, hence I thought it'd be good too. And yes, it was good. I'm not sure why some people don't see the comedy, but for teenagers on a Saturday afternoonI found it quite entertaining. It tackles that awkwardness of teenage puberty and drama giving something to relate to. Well for me and my various friends at least. One thing that I loved is how it presented these issues such as wanting to date the guy your friend likes, masochistic puppy boy love, and clash of internal feelings.\\n\\n\r\nEach of characters have their own back story in which the others end up finding out. It brings up the issue of how much do you really know about your friends and how much will you face for them. Though she wasn't touched on too much I really liked the character Inaba. The character are what you might call cliche and shallow, but as the story unfolds I find myself wanting to know more or feeling emotions such as how are you so stupid and why did you do this. These characters are made naive and young which makes their actions justified yet leaving us shaking our heads.\\n\\n\r\nPlot wise I found it to be quite interesting. Coming from a person who loves physiology and the art of reading people's minds its an interesting take on paranoia. The tasks that Heart Seed puts them through not only tests their relationships, but their own mental health. Though as I reached episode 6 i realized that as heart seed would return how fast would them have to finish it with fillers or more tasks. Luckily I found that they kept it at the same pace choosing not to screw themselves over. I love the thought of Heart Seed having fun watching the group piss themselves, but I couldn't help but notice the inconsistencies as to when he said he wasn't coming back or being nice. But dude decide on something. Stop flip flapping.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this to someone else? Well why yes. Though I do believe it is more for the tween to high school age group. I would not force it on someone unless its like the rec but more of this was a good anime you should watch it type of thing.\\n\\n\r\n-AniVerse REC member",

As you continue onward throughout the first thirteen episodes, you'll find the flashes of brilliance that made this anime one of the best of Summer 2012.\r\nStory [8/10]\r\nThe anime covers the various volumes of the source light novel. From my eyes, it has it's own uniqueness with a backdrop of familiar archetypes. Many will enjoy the romantic drama that is just one of the many points throughout the plot.
