            "content": "\"Like father, like son. Like mother, like daughter\"\r\nThere's an age old belief that certain traits are passed down from parents to children, and like most ancient convictions, there's an element of truth to this one. It's a well known fact that much of a person's future behaviour is learned during their formative years, and while it's true that children will instinctively copy the mannerisms and behaviours of the role models closest to them (which in most cases means their parents), even trained professionals and researchers can't fully explain the \"inheritance\" of less tangible traits like stubbornness, temper, perspicacity, etc.\r\nBut what does all that have todo with a show about a girl who goes off to work at a hotsprings inn? Well, not enough to be honest, and that's biggest problem.\\n\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha (The ABC's of Blooming), is an original anime from P.A. Works that tells the story of Matsumae Ohana, a 16 highschool student who, due to a variety of circumstances regarding her mother, is forced to move away from Tokyo to live with her estranged maternal grandmother, Shijima Sui, at the hotsprings inn that she owns. Knowing that she has no choice in the matter Ohana tries to make the best of her situation, and at the request of her grandmother she begins working at Kissui Inn.\\n\\n\r\nIt all sounds like a fairly straightforward set up for some teenaged melodrama, and for the most part that's what viewers will get. The plot is functional, but the anime can often have difficulty getting to the point or sticking to the storyline, and there's little in the way of originality where the narrative is concerned. In addition to this there appears to be no real direction or cohesiveness with the progression of the series, and these factors may cause viewers to wonder when the story will offer up some actual development.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there's a surprisingly interesting subtextual thread that runs through the plot (which we'll cover in a bit), but because of the numerous issues with the main storyline it's often overlooked. The sad part is that Hanasaku Iroha would have had a much, much better storyline if Okada Mari had simply removed certain events from the screenplay and tightened up the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, some thought seems to have gone into the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nP.A. Works deserve some applause for the effort they've made in producing Hanasaku Iroha as it's easily one of the better looking anime of 2011. The artwork tends towards realism rather than the cartoonish offerings of several titles I could mention, and while this allows for some rather picturesque backgrounds and settings, there are numerous occasions where the usage of various lighting effects create some truly stunning imagery. The animation is fluid, and unlike many other shows of this type, there's a surprising range of movement for both people and animals.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are an interesting mix of styles and shapes that can sometimes appear a little plain, but in actuality there's a method to their design that may not be obvious at first glance. The thing to bear in mind is that the story takes place at a working hotsprings inn, and because of that Sekiguchi Kanami has tried to create a contrast with the picturesque surroundings.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the notable aspects of Hanasaku Iroha is the background music, or rather, the lack of it. There's a nice variety of styles on offer ranging from pastoral pieces (which in some cases sound a bit like elevator music), to upbeat little ditties, but it's the lack of musical accompaniment in many scenes that fits very well with the often quiet tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is why the number of tracks used for the opening and ending themes seem ... a little too much.\\n\\n\r\nLike many 26 episode anime, Hanasaku Iroha features two main opening and ending songs that change over at the midway point of the series. The show begins with a surprisingly well put together sequence that introduces the more prominent characters, but the track used for this, \"Hana no Iro\" by Nano Ripe, is a fairly bland piece that only works because of some good audio/visual choreography. In contrast to this closing sequence is a simple montage of Ohana and her three friends that has been set to \"Hazy\" by Sphere. From episode fourteen the opening track changes to \"Omokage Warp\" by Nano Ripe (again), which is a far more upbeat song than the previous one, and while the animated sequence is different to that of the first OP, the quality and content are pretty similar. The closing song, \"Hanasaku Iroha\" by Clammbon, is a feelgood ballad set to an animated image of Ohana and her friends, but unlike the other sequences it doesn't seem like much effort has been put into this one.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also two more ending themes, \"Tsukikage to Buranko\" (episode 6), and \"Yumeji\" (episode 8), once again performed by Nano Ripe, but there doesn't actually seem to be any real reason for their inclusion so one has to wonder why they were used in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the fact that this is a highschool drama, one might expect a degree of overemphasis when it comes to the acting, but there's surprisingly little of this in the dialogue. The script is well balanced between each of the roles, and while there are occasions where the seiyuu \"fest it up\", in general the voice actors deliver some very good performances. In addition to this there's a surprising, yet clear demarcation between the adult and teenage roles that is apparent not just in the manner of speech, but also in the language used.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the problems with the lack of direction and cohesiveness in the storyline is that it has a direct impact on the prominent characters, and this is the main reason why some viewers consider Ohana to be a very lacklustre lead role. Unfortunately, there's little in the dialogue that can actually raise her above average, and while there are clear efforts made to develop her character, these can often seem contrived or unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it's the supporting characters who really steal the show.\\n\\n\r\nFrom Ohana's mother, Matsumae Satsuki, to Kawajiri Takako, the business consultant for Kissui Inn, the adult roles are defined from the start of the series, and this makes a nice contrast to the somewhat vague characterisation of Minko, Nako and Yuina (Ohana's friends). The series also makes the effort to further develop several of the supporting roles, and because of this the subtextual thread in the plot comes to light.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface Hanasaku Iroha is nothing more than another teenaged melodrama, but underneath it's also a story about family and role models, and that aspect of the series is far more intriguing than much of the exisitng plot. The relationship between Sui, Satsuki and Enishi forms the cornerstone of everything that happens at Kissui Inn, and unlike many other anime out there the series handles the dynamics of this in a very realistic manner. Thanks to the efforts made to highlight how each person affects the other two, several minor but key clarifications of the storyline become apparent, the most notable being the reasons for the estrangement between Satsuki and her mother, Enishi's desperate attempts to win his mother's approval and finally step out of the shadow of his sister, and Ohana's festival wish at the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha isn't as good as it could have been, but that doesn't make it bad. If one is able to tolerate the tangents in the storyline then it really is a pretty decent show at its core, and it's a fairly good depiction of working life in a hotel. That said, at 26 episodes this series really is far too long, and it can often feel like certain events or situations were added only to fill the required number of episodes. Unfortunately the detrimental effect this has on the character interactions may lead to some viewers giving up on the show entirely,\\n\\n\r\nThe sad part is that if the series had been trimmed down and the subtextual plot given more prominence, this could easily have been a contender for the best anime of 2011, but as it is right now it's nothing more than another show that joins the ranks of \"Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda\".",

            "content": "Hanasaku Iroha was in my eyes the best show of the season.\r\nThe Art is simply beautiful and the animation is definitely good for a TV series. At no point is any of the character art off model or deformed even for distant shots. Generic background people in high population scenes tend to be done in the crappy 3d which has become popular in most recent shows, however the models are properly textured to blend with the environment and main characters, though their walk animations feel a little off. This is of course only a small problem since most of the show takes place where thereare few people thus even the background people are fully animated in 2d. The colours are vibrant and really enhance the feeling of the environment. There are background shots through out the series so far which are simply stunning.\\n\\n\r\nMost scenes don't have any background music at all in this show. Save for some comedic tunes the music is saved for only the scenes that need them. When those scenes come around the music beautifully compliments the art and the animation, and gently tug at your emotions. The Opening theme is sung very well by the artist and the lyrics match Ohana's attitude and state of mind very well. The ending theme is a soothing piece which has a sort of \"It's been a good run...\" type of feel to it. Episode 11's ending was changed to match the feeling of the show at that point int he story.\\n\\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to talk about the story and characters separately as this show is entirely character driven. Not a single element in this show happens \"because that's the way we we wanted it to go.\" Everything flows smoothly as if each character was living and properly acting and reacting to the environment. The only thing even mildly questionable is Ohana's death grip on what she thinks is right. Character development for some of the minor characters feel rushed in the early episodes, however I'm willing to let that slide as it was probably to make way for Ohana's own story and there is further development with those characters later on. Her own development of course is really well written and her relationship with other characters very well scripted. I'd say these characters are definitely on the deep end of the character depth pool, Ko being the exception.  I can sum him up in 2 words; devoted and supportive. That said he is dealt with and dealt with well in season 2, so if you are distressed over the lack of development in their relationship do not despair.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I feel this is definitely a great show, and absolutely without a doubt would recommend this show to anyone who's looking for a great show with some great characters that they can seriously feel and believe.",

            "content": "I enjoy slice of life. I really do. The problem I have with them is that it\u2019s incredibly difficult to find one that isn\u2019t terrible. The two biggest pitfalls I find with the genre are the lack of compelling plots and the lack of depth as the episodes get drowned in clich\u00e9s. They often end up simply being boring as the episodes drag on to the formulaic beach/school festival/holiday routine in an attempt to entertain. Needless to say, I\u2019m usually turned off by the introduction to a slice of life anime before I can even get into the series.\r\nI watched Hanasku Iroha with massive heapsof cautious optimism. The entire premise sounded a little worrying. It tells of a teenage girl, Ohana, who experiences a set of circumstances that would send her to live and work with her grandmother, who owns and manages a hot spring inn of a small town. A hot spring inn staffed by mostly teenage girls? With that setup, fanservice seemed to be primary driving force.\\n\\n\r\nWatching the first few episodes, I was pleasantly surprised. The characters had depth and were likable. The stereotype of the doting grandmother never got played out, settling for the minor stereotype of the \u201ctough love\u201d grandmother instead. There were actual obstacles presented to the characters. The events of one episode held consequences over the next episode. And for some bizarre reason, the anime that least needed fantastic animation had some of the best animation of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe central message of Hanasaku Iroha is one about purpose. Ohana is pulled out of her comfort zone and sent into an unknown town. Here, the insecurities of her life are magnified. Here, she suddenly is faced with the uncertainty of where she wants to go in life. Here, she is forced to grow up, just a little bit. However, she embraces her new life and tries to find her place as one of the waitresses of the inn. She begins to learn more about herself, her place in life, and her family. Her resolve to face these challenges serve bring about change in the staff of the inn. Each member of the staff are faced with a crossroads on where they see themselves heading. As the story progresses, there is legitimate growth in each character. In the end, even the status quo of the inn is changed as a result of this growth with Ohana\u2019s grandmother closing the inn to allow the staff to pursue their own dreams.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best points of the series is how well they understand their audience. Each point that needs to be made is clearly made without underestimating the audience\u2019s ability to understand. They show character development and conflicts rather than telling us about it. Some of the best scenes have no words at all, something that can easily be afforded with the animation quality. As a result, the plot doesn\u2019t get too caught up in its own complications. They focus in on a situation just enough to get us tied to the characters before attempting to tug at our heartstrings.\\n\\n\r\nAs captivating and dramatic as it is, Hanasaku Iroha has its drawbacks. Remember that fanservice I suspected a few paragraphs back? It\u2019s certainly here. It never completely dominates the series, but it doesn\u2019t add anything either. My stance of fanservice is a disapproving one. I\u2019ve never felt that it\u2019s truly necessary for the female characters to disrobe for whatever reason or to include all these bath scenes. At best, it\u2019s an odd scene to inject into an otherwise good episode; at worst, it is the entire series. Thankfully, the episodes that do include fanservice use them with a decent amount of restraint. Like I said earlier, it doesn\u2019t harm the series as a whole. It\u2019s just a bit unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe romantic dramas within the series are a whole mixed bag for me. I enjoyed the drama they added and how it complicated the situation at the inn at times. Yet, the infuriating pacing and lack of closure on some of the stories really got to me. I know that the focus is supposed to be on the characters themselves while the romance is used to contrast their growth throughout the show. Then again, with the possible announcement of a second season, there should be plenty of time to flesh out those side stories in addition to showing us what the staff is up to now.\\n\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha has reaffirmed my belief in slice of life series. It\u2019s raised the bar for what will pass as entertaining and engaging and hopefully, it\u2019ll continue to do so in its possible second season. I\u2019m still going to approach these shows with cautious optimism, though. There\u2019s just too much crap out there sometimes.",

            "content": "Hanasaku Iroha Review:\r\nEverybody knows that \"void\" feeling you get when you finish a really great show. The feeling of emptiness that you feel when you finish a show that really connected with you or entertained you on a higher level. Only a few shows give you a feeling like this, and for each person the type of shows that can produce this feeling differ. For me, Clannad is the golden case of a show that gave me a void, because for months on end after finishing it, all I wanted to do was rewatch it.\r\nHanasaku Iroha is an anime that gave me my first \"void\"in quite some time.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7.2/10:\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha is a slice of life anime that follows the life of city-girl, Ohana, while she lives and works at her grandmother's inn. Like most slice of life anime, the story does not necessarily follow a focused plot, and instead finds its niche in story arcs complimented by underlying themes and a very loose main character arc. The story by no means breaks any grounds or really stands out from the crowd in terms of its concept, but its execution are what elevate Hanasaku Iroha's story from the crowd of slice of life anime. The story has many great character arcs that really get you attached to the characters. The themes in the story are also very easy to relate too. Whether its the idea of hard work pays off, the struggles of adapting to a new setting, failing to live up to your parent's expectations, or simply struggling to gain the love of the one you want, Hanasaku Iroha tackles a slew of themes that many will connect with. Because of these themes, the show can get quite emotional at times, but the characters and writing does also open the door for some entertaining comedy. I also have to point out that the homestretch of the show does provide some edge of your seat entertainment as you desperately hope to find out what happens next. Slice of Life anime tend to limit themselves on how good their story can be due to a focus on a character driven plot, and Hanasaku Iroha is no exception. However, the execution and maturity of the story are without a doubt worth recognition.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8.6:\\n\r\nP.A. Works has yet to fail to impress me with their animation quality. They always manage to bring a really cinematic feel to all their projects and Hanasaku Iroha is no exception. The character designs are all great, as well as the varied settings. There were quite a few still frames, but seeing as the show wasn't action packed, and with the lighting and colors being as beautiful as they were, this wasn't much of an issue. Really, the art is just beautiful and really helps immerse you into the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7.8:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to this show was great. The background tracks weren't really that memorable or noticeable but that was fine given the kind of laid back tone this show had. However, when the show needed to get serious or emotional, the soundtrack did shine. Additionally, I must say that the first OP is absolutely fantastic. I didn't skip it once while watching the show, and that is damn impressive for me. The voice acting was a bit up and down, but overall strong. Most of the characters were well portrayed by their VA's but there was one character that was so frustratingly annoying with her nonstop Engrish that the voice acting portion of this grade has to take a dip down. But with the overall strong voice acting, and great, but not fantastic soundtrack, I still have to give this segment a high score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8.2/10:\\n\r\nThe thing that makes or breaks slice of life shows is its characters, and I must say that Hanasaku Iroha had a splendid group of characters. The first of the notable characters I will mention is Ohana. Ohana is the main character and a very outgoing teenage girl from Tokyo. She is forced to leave Tokyo and her best friend Ko (who admitted his feelings for her before she left), due to circumstances with her mom, and is now living/working at her grandmother's inn. Ohana is a caring, hard working, and energetic girl that is extremely likeable. Next is Minko who is a chef in training at the inn. Minko is very sharp-tongued and mean, but she is also very dedicated to her craft and actually a nice person underneath her harsh words. And finally we have Nako, the timid girl who is a waitress with Ohana. All three of these girls, and really all the characters in general seem to initially fit a set, one dimensional archetype. However, the beautiful thing about this show is that every single character develops. The characters all learn new things about themselves and by the end of the show all become better, more likable people. What I think makes these characters so likable, even more-so than the outstanding development they have, is just how easy it is to relate to them, and how human they seem. They all have desires, struggles, and emotions that we all feel. The interactions between the characters can also be golden at times. The only thing holding the character section back here is the lack of a unique, stand-out type of character that you could find in some other shows like Code Geass (Lelouch), Steins;Gate (Okabe), or Haruhi Suzumiya (I wonder who). But really, with this kind of show, a more realistic main lead probably fits the role better than a wildly unique one. Oh... and Takako is pretty bad at first...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8.1/10:\\n\r\nLike I said in the into: This show gave me a void. I connected with the characters so much, that by the time the show was nearing its approach, I was feeling sad that it was going to end. Although I enjoy almost every anime I watch, Hanasaku Iroha for some reason just stuck with me better than the vast majority of others. It isn't an edge of your seat thriller like Death Note, nor is it a laugh out loud comedy like , or a non stop tear jerker like Clannad. The atmosphere of this show is actually quite laid back, with some drama and humor here and there. But because I became so attached to the characters, I couldn't help but feel a little empty when it was all over. This has become one of my favorite slice of life animes and I am so glad I decided to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7.98/10:\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha is a beautiful anime that is truly in the top tier of the slice of life genre. It is not only visually and audibly stunning, but the themes and characters in this simple show really help make it one to remember. It may not have one primary theme, story, or ability that it really owns, but it impresses in every category that a slice of life should, making for a very enjoyable experience. By the time you finish this show, you will be wishing you could rewatch it all over again like you'd never seen it before.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nA wonderful slice of life that feels how it's supposed to: Real.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Beautiful animation\\n\r\n+Brilliant OP1\\n\r\n+Character development\\n\r\n+Realistic themes and struggles\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Takako...\\n\r\n- No big emotional or intense scenes\\n\r\n- Ohana x Ko \"relationship\" is poorly paced\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Hanasaku Iroha, watch...\\n\r\nNagi No Asukara:\\n\r\nAlso by PA Works with a very similar art style and similar themes of friendship and the idea that people and things all eventually change.\\n\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo:\\n\r\nAnother fantastic slice of life anime with emphasis on hard work and dedication as well as strong characters.\\n\\n\r\n7.98 - Wonderful",

            "content": "It's been a long time since I've seen a Slice of Life done well. I'm not sure what it is about Hanasaku Iroha, but it is one of the calmest anime I have seen in a long while. There's something about the series that is just very relaxing.\r\nThe story essentially revolves around Ohana, a young teenage girl, and her experiences as she works as a waitress in an inn. As the show progresses, you are able to see the blooming relationships that develop as she begins to understand herself and the people around her. The show focuses on the challenges of being a teenage girland Ohana's inner resolve to 'fest' it up no matter the situation. While there is romance, it is extremely slow paced. It will pop in from time to time to apply a dose of necessary drama to keep the audience interested in what will happen next and how it will affect each character. For a 26 episode series, I was skeptical at first of how they could achieve a balance between the amount of entertaining material and filling such a large amount of time. Much to my delight PA works really did manage to balance these two quite well. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art/Animation was good. The first opening had some choppy parts in the animation, but the animation throughout the series flowed smoothly and there's nothing to complain about here. I also found the openings and endings to be quite nice; fitting, if you will, for the show. One aspect that I felt was unnecessary here was the fan service. While it's not over the top ecchi, there are scenes that just felt out of place considering this is a slice of life drama. I'm kind of split between whether or not to criticize or praise this because on one hand the risque factor was toned down quite a lot, but on the other hand it didn't help further the show's enjoyment and wasn't necessary. \\n\\n\r\nNow going back to the bit about Hanasaku Iroha being 26 episodes. The 26 episodes really did justice to each of the characters. Each character's strengths, weaknesses, and quirks felt really defined. The pacing of the show, besides the romance, was solid and had a laid back flow. Ohana is very strong-willed and has a natural helping, outgoing personality. Minko is a tsundere that gets overly jealous and is quick to jump to conclusions. Nako is the quiet girl who's pretty much perfect yet is somehow very timid and lacks charisma. As the series progresses, each character becomes more and more likeable; you really get to see that they are all good people with good intentions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a solid, relaxing watch. If you have the time, and enjoy the Slice of Life genre, perhaps you might consider booking a reservation at Kissuiso to see what it has to offer.",

            "content": "So hey, let's talk Hanasaku Iroha.\r\nHanasaku Iroha is a 26 episode s'life drama about a bunch of teenage girls with incredibly poor listening abilities working in an inn as waitresses while trying to overcome their crippling urge to yell at everything that they don't immediately understand. Well, OK. This is a touch unfair. It's only Ohana and Minko who do this, Minko doing the yelling of the angry variety while Ohana covers the obscenely unaware side of the yelling spectrum, but most of the show is focused on these two. The thing with Hanasaku Iroha is that, asides from the drama side of things, it'shard to find any faults. The humour is surprisingly clever and never doubts your intelligence by pointing out the jokes for you. The animation is incredibly pretty. The characters are well rounded individuals who almost never fall into stereotype. It's just it's most interested in being a drama and that is precisely the area it fails at.\\n\\n\r\nFor now though, I feel like talking about the positive, specifically the one area I will throw myself to the floor in gratitude for: The humour. HanaIro isn't primarily a comedy, so don't go expecting to be struggling for breath through fits of giggles, but what jokes it does have, it never feels the need to have someone point them out for you. It recognises that you, the viewer, are an intelligent person (a rather dangerous assumption to make on behalf of the general population, it has to be said, but treat someone like they're a doofus and they'll start acting like one, self-fulfilling prophecies and all that) and recognise the humour behind Ohana constantly running away from the Heron when it blocks her path. We do not require a second character asking her why she ran away. We can see the Heron with it's freaky little beady eyes and shockingly large wingspan and fully understand why Ohana has decided to take the alternate path to prevent confronting the beast.\\n\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha assume you're intelligent enough to notice this sort of stuff in other areas too, such as symbolism. Using our friend the Heron again, there is a scene in the final episode where Ohana is confronted by the Beast again but, instead of running away like she normally does, she marches on by it. It's a symbol that she has finally gained up the courage to focus on her problems and not run around them like she usually does. Simple, but it does this without feeling the need to monologue why this scene is important. Also fanservice. It's nice to have a series where I can ogle attractive female anime characters without insulting my intelligence by hovering the camera over their underwear in case we were too busy scratching our arses to notice (apart from this one lingering shot of a wet t-shirt in episode 3, but that episode was generally retarded so we can forget about that).\\n\\n\r\nI also liked how there were little stories revolving around the minor characters in the show. Any personal conflicts that I enjoyed watching with characters tended to be any of the characters that weren't teenage girls because they were the conflicts that were treated with a sense of humour about them (and didn't yell all the fucking time). Some of them are incredibly simple, such as the head chef's Ren and his desire to become more confident. Once they had established that he gets nervous very easily, it was a reoccurring joke that he would try to man up, such as buying Yakuza jackets with a proud look on his face. Or the Beanman, the old codger who appeared in the background every now and then, who seemingly was the only person who knew how the inn worked. Personally, I'm convinced that he could make the inn sprout legs and move to a more tourist friendly area, like Howls Moving Castle, piloting the building from inside the boiler room.\\n\\n\r\nI can't go talking about the characters without mentioning Ohana's mum. MILF to end all MILF's. Absolute star of the show, particularly impressive when she only appeared for episodes 1, 12-14 and 24-26. It was only when she was around that the drama started to actually click because she had a sense of bloody humour about her own insecurities and flaws. Best scenes of the anime were Ohana's mum drinks alcohol with Ohana's granny and Ohana. Or how about Ohana's mum pretends she's going to watch porn with Ko, Ohana's bland boyfriend. Underneath the story about Ohana's growth and the growth of the other teenage girls, there's a story about her making up with her family and becoming a (slightly) more responsible parent. There's never anyone going \"LOOK GUIZ, SHE'S A BETTER PARENT NAOW\" because we can spot that for ourselves.\\n\\n\r\nI should also give some lipservice to the animation. For all their other faults, P.A. Works always have incredibly good animation and artwork. It's more of the shiny variety than the free-flowing movement of the works from Bones or KyoAni, but don't mistake this for an inability to animate movement. I found myself wondering this after a few episodes, whether I was simply being suckered in to thinking the animation was good simply because of scenery porn and attractive shiny female character designs. But no, the actual animated movement is gorgeous too. Hair moves when the characters shake their heads about. Clothes crease and fold when they move their hands. It sounds like a weird thing to focus on, but often having shiny pretty character designs hides the fact the characters are completely static, so bravo to HanaIro for that.\\n\\n\r\nBut the drama. Christ above, the bloody drama. I know teenage girls are stupid and refuse to listen to each other and get into the most irritating fights, so I guess I should congratulate them on accurately depicting typical teenage girls, but it does not make fascinating viewing. Minko deserves a mention here. She also deserves a kick in the stomach and a boot to the face and various other forms of pain. Every single damn time there's something to talk about, she gets angry and yells at everyone. I thought maybe her anger with Ohana and crush on Tohru would be a short lived thing, but it ran throughout the entire show, getting more screentime than any other plot point. Ohana isn't much better, being so braindead that she barges into every situation thinking talking really loudly and being energetic will get her through. You might be forgiven for thinking Nako is better because she's so quiet, but don't let that fool you. She solves any problems she encounters by quiet yelling, spouting off single phrases without listening to what other characters are saying. None of them bloody listen to each other or what anyone else is saying, making any dramatic confrontation lead nowhere because there's no logical process in the dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nPlus there's the fact that what they're arguing about isn't in the slightest bit interesting. Now this may be a personal thing, since I struggle to get into melodramatic anime involving minor human problems, but did you really ever care about the future of the Kissiuso Inn? Like, really? I didn't, yet they spent hours arguing over the future of the bloody place. This really dragged down in the final bunch of episodes, because that became the main talking point. I liked the characters internal conflicts with their own faults, but there seemed to be a disconnect between their own internal faults and what the issues on the outside were. This drama is pretty much my only fault with the show, but it unfortunately happens to be the central focus, so it really dragged down my enjoyment as a whole. Again though, this could be just me. If you're the kind of easily emotionally manipulated loser who thinks Ano Hana is one of the best shows of the year, then maybe you too will like the drama in HanaIro.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't like the core of Hanasaku Iroha. The drama that was like a giant gaudy painting of a fat poodle in the showroom that was meant to be the living room's centrepiece.  But I liked all the d\u00e9cor surrounding it. I liked the picturesque potted plants of the attractive animation and character designs. I liked the stylish coffee table of the clever humour. I liked the comfy leather sofa of Ohana's mum...err, don't think too hard about that final metaphor. Anyway, I liked enough of the various aspects of Hanasaku Iroha to get me passed the dull drama and enjoy the show as a whole.",

It seems by the end of the first several episodes, everything from friendship to conflicts is set in place. The story afterward enfolds in an episodic way, with no noteworthy character development or meaningful plot twists. And sadly the cuteness factor in the main character turned into annoyance. I hoped Ohana would use her perseverance to her advantage and gain some maturity, but that didn't happen.\r\nThen all the other characters stay 2-D throughout. \r\nSo even though Idid try hard to like this series, I don't think I'll be continuing it anymore. \\n\r\nPlus, now I can't even stand the opening song after they changed it.",

As her live took a turn and she started working, she realises this does not work.\r\nOhana has lived with her mother all her life and her mother is carefree and selfish. Ohana learned by her mother by words and self-experience that relying others never works. Atleast for Ohana at this time, she always ended up getting hurt. But when her mother sends her away to her Grandma's Inn to live. She is forced to work to earn her living and learns that you must rely on others since you can't do everything by yourself.\\n\\n\r\nWatching 12 episodes, Ohana meets more and more complicated situations and often tries to improve and fix these by herself when others does not act. But when she tries, she eventually fails at some point until her friends come and help her up always saying \"Why did you do it on your own?\". Story shows great love and great co-operative work and shows it well.\\n\\n\r\nArt, 10!\\n\r\nThis is seriously the one of the best if not THE best art I've seen! The art is very much detailed and beautiful. Even the backgrounds are in great detail, and no wasted efforts. \\n\r\nThe characters are beautiful and unique, I especially like Ohana's sweet and innocent but strong living look and it fits so well in to the series.\\n\r\nWhereever you look you see fine detail on all objects thru the entire series so far. It's amazing how much time they've spent on the art. Well worth the 10!\\n\\n\r\nSound, 8\\n\r\nThe opening theme is great, but not really remember-able. It's the usual you could say. Mainstream. But I guess you will (Atleast I will) recognise the song if you watch the opening every episode.\\n\r\nThe voice actor Itou Kanae does the voice for Ohana! She is a very good voice actor and performs exceptional well here. She has voiced other great series for the main character like Toaru Kagaku no Railgun, Sora no Manimani, Shugo Chara!, Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai (The world god only knows)\\n\r\nThe background music is very well done. But here aswell, Mainstream. It's nothing wrong with it, since it does give a very good experience, but as said for opening, nothing you will remember probably.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, 10\\n\r\nThis is superb! Ohana Matsumae is a clear 10 in my perspective.\\n\r\nAt first she seems to be a normal girl with a very cute face (and the voice acting is so good and fits so well makes it even cuter) but as you watch and get to the turning point, she reveals many more sides and I actually need to watch a few more episodes before I can fully explain how she is as person.\\n\r\nShe is hard-working and determined when she want to prove she can perform well. She has a good heart and does not want to anyone take the blame for her mistakes. She does not give up, and she puts a lot of effort in to her objectives. \\n\r\nAnd one thing that keeps her going is the fact her Grandma is strict and old fashion. Her saying is \"A careless effort does nothing but harm\", and clearly, Ohana does not want to harm anyone and wants to prove her efforts are not careless.\\n\r\nThe other characters that works at the inn are very special and have their roles and personalties. Much is focused around the protagonist here, but all supporting char are VERY well done and no wasted effort.\\n\r\nAs this series is about efforts, it's only natural that this would be good.\\n\\n\r\n12 epsiodes in, more have been shown for teh supportive characters, not only Ohana and Ko-chan have lovey dovey feelings, but there is a side story going on with another romance. And secrets are being revealed with many of the side characters that just improve the story. It's very entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 9\\n\r\nSo far. I enjoyed this a lot and cant wait until the next episode. And this is probably going to be the best Anime for this season or close to it.\\n\r\nYou will feel attachment to Ohana, I've never seen a similar character and cannot think of any other character from a different series that is similar.\\n\r\nWe all have our tastes but this is a Seinen Series and the majority of people will probably like this.\\n\\n\r\nMy Enjoyment now is 10. This is superb series and I just totally love Ohana.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 9\\n\r\nIt's not a 10, even though I feel like giving it one. But well worth a 9.\\n\r\nI can tell this is ABSOLUTELY worth watching. If you don't like this, then you just don't. But I doubt any would dislike it.\\n\r\nIt has a great heart to it, and much we can learn to put in our own lives.\\n\\n\r\nIt's well made, its beautiful, it's unique in almost all aspects, I've seen 2 episodes, and going crazy. Episodes are released Sundays, so don't miss out.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let's cut to the chase, Hanasaku Iroha has its moments, but ultimately it lost its direction midway.\r\nThe story can be summarized as a group of cute girls working in an inn doing a bunch of things that normally wouldn't be interesting in real life. However this is Anime, so something like wiping the floor becomes extraordinary exciting all of a sudden and there are plenty more real life boring activities the show will make it incredibly exciting. \r\nThe other component of Hanasucku 's story are the romantic dramas. There are romantic dramas that are fun to watch, but if you have seen any romance Anime,you can figure out pretty much figure out who will end up with who. \\n\\n\r\nBy midway, Hanasaku's almost episodic nature becomes more and more boring and it didn't feel like any of the arcs were going anywhere (other than the romance ones). Watching a cute girl washing dishes while ogling at her man or  cleaning the windows early morning no longer excites the viewers. Fortunately the pace picks up near the end with all the inn drama; still, the drama was a bit cheap (not to mention forced to create a plot) in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the characters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all unfortunately either recycled characters from some other show or just plain old archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nOhana - typical pretty peacemaker, needs to get into everyone's ways until everyone is happy.\\n\\n\r\nMinchi - violent tsundere, but cute\\n\\n\r\nNakochi - timid miss perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThere is this other girl named Yuina, but I don't think she could even write her name properly, so she does not deserve a mention (oh wait...)\\n\\n\r\nThe surrounding visuals is very well done, the character designs are okay. The first opening song really fits the show, but the second opening is terrible. I also liked Michi's VA, it expresses her character well. \\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this Anime because I watched one episode per week. Had this been an Anime that was already completed, I do not think I would even pick this up. \\n\\n\r\nHanasaku isn't a waste of time, but not worth watching either.\\n",

            "content": "Like other PA works animes in the past, Hanasaku Iroha has managed to provide quite the unique experience, but this is not necessarily a good thing. If I were to sum up the idea of this anime, it could be put quite simply as learning to love your work. It is a fairly down to earth idea, and I would have been hard pressed to imagine that I would be coming into a show with such an identity crisis as this one.\r\nThe story begins with the main character Ohana being forced by her mother to move in with her Grandmother who happens to be thevery strict owner of a hot spring inn. Being forced to work for room and board, Ohana decides to do everything she can to make the most of her life.\\n\\n\r\nThe series really started out quite wonderfully as a very promising coming of age story. It had top notch visuals and had a compelling enough premise to get behind our main character Ohana as she tries to \"fest it up.\" The problem is that this show had an odd balance between trying to be a drama that could be taken seriously, and a story that often disgraced its cast in favor of some not so great comedy. This would surface as soon as episode 3 in the show where all of a sudden the show is injected with odd fanservice and the cast is beaten with a stupid stick.\\n\\n\r\nI do not have a problem with trying to have comedy in this show, but in a story that tires to take itself seriously it should never come at the expense of each character's dignity. One of the best representatives of this in the series is the character Minko, who is supposed to be a very moody, but beautiful girl with a one tracked mind of fulfilling her quest to become a chef. Unfortunately, her mannerisms and actions often lacked grace and style, so she often just came off as an unnecessarily angry and unlikable person. The balance of her character definitely became better as the show went along, but the handling of her character was pretty poor and led to several awkwardly bad moments in the series.\\n\\n\r\nStill though these problems usually came at the expense of the male cast rather than the female cast, which made Minko look good by comparison amazingly enough. Throughout the show this anime had a penchant for showcasing males to be far more incompetent at everything they do compared to their female peers. Ohana's uncle Enishi is always shown to be an incompetent fool who could never compare  in ability to his mother or his sister when it came to running the inn Kissuiso. The cook Tohru is first shown to be a serious chef, but then is often displayed as an insensitive, bumbling fool. Ohana's romantic interest in this show, Kou apparently only ever knew the method of inaction in his one sided romantic relation and preceded to waltz around in melancholy the whole time. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the female cast went, Ohana's character was the shining star of the entire show, and I would be hard pressed to find someone who actually dislikes her character. Her little phrases like \"fest it up,\" or \"sparkling\" would become trademark aspects of her character that both the cast and audience would come to love her for. A character once said in the show that the \"Kissuiso is fun because she's there\" and I could not agree more. Without her character, I doubt this show would have ever worked at all. She was a bullheaded girl who often charged into a chaotic world. She would constantly butt into people's problems and try to fix everything up. The cast would label her as inconsiderate for doing so, but this inconsideration is precisely what made her character so likable.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like some of the characters, the plot often was handled very awkwardly. The main plot threads consist mostly of Ohana's romantic troubles with Kou as she moved from Tokyo, Ohana finding a place for herself in this new life of hers as she learns to appreciate her work, and the impending crisis that is the Inn's future, both financially and in leadership. This was all clear at least by the very end, but it often got side tracked.\\n\\n\r\nSeveral of the arcs throughout the show seemed to be pointing in different directions altogether. Worst of them all was the ones involving Enishi. Several times we are led to believe that he would take leadership of the Inn, and truly lead it in a good direction only to find out that he is incompetent and incapable of doing so. Many times in the show we are shown Ohana making progress in her new life in certain arcs, but then it flips around and paints her as a distressed person who does not know quite what she wants to do coupled with huge self-esteem issues. \\n\\n\r\nThese are but two examples of the sort of backpedaling and moving forward at the same time that this show constantly treads, which really does become tiresome as it goes on. It is hard to know what the anime is quite trying to show us or tell us. Sometimes it hamfists certain messages through that are very disagreeable, and other times does not capitalize enough on the good things it's trying to tell. Despite this of course, the main message of this show always was learning to love your work, and that is something I think anyone can get behind.\\n\\n\r\nIn considering the production values of this show I must say the visuals were very good as always for a PA works show, but not perfect. I did not absolutely love the character designs, but they were not bad. The audio side of this show on the other hand had lots of issues. Too often there was a complete absence of a BGM track to set the mood and pace of this show properly. The few tracks they did have were quite forgettable.There is nothing wrong with utilizing the magic of silence in a show, but it needs to be used properly, something this show definitely did not do. \\n\\n\r\nDespite my tone, this anime was not all bad, and I definitely found entertainment throughout it even if at times for the wrong reasons.. The anime's best moments were definitely at the start, the very middle, and towards the end. There were enough highs in this series for me to look upon it sort of fondly. It was indeed a unique experience, precisely because it was such an infuriating mesh of love and hatred.\\n\\n\r\nI can justify this anime as a passable \"good\" watch, but nothing more. It was much too flawed and mishandled for me to consider it anything more. It started beautifully and ended beautifully as a series I must say, but there were many problems between the beginning and end points to drive me more than a little crazy. This leads me to believe that this show should have been 1 cour, but alas PA works seems like they have some issues on reigning in their productions properly as this is not the first example of an anime with tons of potential just not doing enough with it. I definitely would not say this anime is a waste of one's time, but it also is not something that I would jump to recommend to most people.",

            "content": "Out of all the slice of life's I've seen i have to say this is one of the best, and its an all time favorite of mine. It's a pretty relaxing anime to watch, and it is defiantly one of those anime that is going to leave a empty hole in your heart once you finish it, because its just that amazing.\r\nStory 10- The story overall was really good, its like any typical slice of life. Its about a girl sent to her grandmas inn because her mother runs off with her boyfriend. Like most slices of life the story doesn't follow a set orderits mostly about the hardships and changes Ohana has to deal with once see arrives Kissuiso. The story teaches about how hard work can not only lead to your happiness but others happiness to, and that in the end the work put in can really make a difference. Lets just  say if Kissuiso was a real inn, i defiantly make reservations.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10- Everything is beautifully made, and the atmosphere surrounding Kissuiso is calm but at the same time fun. The characters are look wonderful and they all fit the story perfectly. I absolutely love how Kissuiso looks, and its texture. Its a place i wouldn't mind working at that is for sure.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9- Both the openings of this anime are my all time favorites. The openings were so good that i never even thought to skipped them not even once. All the voices were perfect and the sound effects were good. There was this one women who kept speaking words in English though an it sounded really weird.Other than that the sound was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10- I loved watching all the characters develop, just seeing there emotions go crazy. I felt so bad for Ohana throughout the series always regretting her decision from the first episode i don't wanna spoil it though so i wont say anything else. Watching Ohana cope with her new life was really amazing, and watching her have so much fun while working was hilarious. Minko was another character i loved, i felt so bad for her because she could never get the one she loved to understand her feelings, and it made be sad inside. Nako was a sweet character, though timid and shy at work, she was nice and took very well care of her family. I really did love her personality. I also loved how all three characters fit so well together in this setting, and i also loved watching their friendships develop. Overall those three are a very loving cast, and have a wonderful friendship.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9- This anime was really fun to watch, and i really enjoyed watching all the characters develop. I enjoyed the beautiful scenery, and like i said before i loved the atmosphere. I honestly enjoyed this anime so much that i miss watching it, and hearing all the characters laughing while having tons of fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10- I give it 10, because in my opinion Hanasaku Iroha is a beautifully done anime. Its a really good slice of life. The characters really do make this anime enjoyable, and overall its a must watch for those slice of life fans.",

Remember, as this is my first review of my first interest, but I hope you appreciate.\r\nOhana, the lead female, has unique, an unusual attitude you won't see easily in any girl--pretty much instead resemble a guy's nature but that's just me. I like Ohana, she resembles me wholly if not partly--being expectant all the time, that is.\r\nThe characters, you won't see any cliche there, as they were supposed to be made unique and dramatic--according to the lead. We'll see a lot of dramas and changes overtime.\r\nThe plot, rather rare, and is exciting, especially if the numberof episodes are 26.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks, this one I didn't completely attend to fully, not because I dislike it but because it seems it doesn't click with my ears in the first time but is fitting.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, is beautifully composed, no complaints there, especially if you pay attention on how its made (specifically the background) you will notice that is full of effort.\\n\\n\r\nOverall good start, prolly my best anime this season, I'd like to see how this turns in and out.",

The main character is whimsical and has a childlike sense of the world, but is somewhat forced to confront the realities of what becoming an adult is like when she is forced to work at an inn. this show also refreshingly doesn't fall intoa lot of the cliche's with this type of setup. The main character is constantly thinking of her life as a story setting, and being disappointed by reality.\\n\\n\r\nGood music, good visuals/animation, interesting characters, and a believable setting are all a plus. I really wish I could write more for this review, but one episode certainly is not enough for me to say more.\\n\\n\r\nThis epside 8/10, the show has a potential to be a 9 depending on where they take the story.\\n\\n\r\nFor a plot synopsis, just click the link and read the one on this website.",

They made a slice of life drama and turned it into an anime series that I personally have trouble not watching again! I enjoyed every part of it all the way down to the romance and the really funny comedy in this show. I found the story about Ohana Matsumae to be very enjoyable to hear about. I got to see every bump in the road of a 16 year old girl's life that has a mother who she thinks doesn't care about her and focuses more on her job andfinding a husband then she does on her daughter. Ohana tries to get away from that and runs right into a grandmother who she isn't really sure she cares about her either. Through all the hard times she has of course there are good times, too. Along with moving to live with her grandmother at her hot spring inn, she gets three awesome friends and finally understands what it's like to love/like someone. Ohana's attitude made me look at life with a different outlook. She is a beautifully made main character. I am still waiting for there to be a another season or an OVA to this anime. I would love to see more of all the characters lives and how everyone is doing. If you haven't seen this anime, you are definitely missing out!",

That is when life slaps her in the face in the form of her grandmother telling her she has towork to earn her expenses.\\n\r\nFrom that point on she and all the workers at the inn are faced with different situations mostly together in the struggle it shows different situations that end up in an amusing way.\\n\r\nThe Story is not meant to impress viewers nor evolve into something greater, but give people insight in the character's everyday lives at the inn while making them laugh.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is one of the best I've seen because of it's use of lighting to create memorable scenery and characters all while fitting the genre of the anime. Also actions like moving, speaking grunting are displayed in a continuous fashion and not by putting bits together as I have seen on other occasions.\\n\r\nThe climax of the artwork on Hanasaku Iroha are the backgrounds, very well made and at some point can even make you confuse them for reality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are designed from a similar template with added elements to customize them or are uniquely made to fit the role they are playing all while minimizing the image of a particular person and to contribute to a more authentic scene . \\n\r\nThey mostly react in a realistic way to the story by laughing getting angry falling and so on, adding to the quality of the overall work.\\n\r\nSince the story isn't what this anime is supposed to focus on you can't say there are antagonists or side characters they all blend in this environment to create in the viewer's mind a feeling of reality even if he knows it isn't.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Hanasaku Iroha is an authentic presentation of how life works and plays around with humans revealing it's two faces.

            "content": "\"All the art of living lies in a fine mingling of letting go and holding on.\" - Henry Ellis\r\nI don't think I could have found a more suitable quote for this anime. Hanasaku Iroha is an anime that takes a break from the supernatural anime and takes a more realistic approach: one that depicts what, when, and how to let go.\r\nThe story of a 16 year old girl being sent to work at a hotel may not seem very realistic but the events that happen because of it actually do. Leaving a best friend and a hometown is tough and very difficult to let go.Ohana experiences this tough change in life and begins to find a home in the hotel she works at, Kissuiso. Accompanied by her co-workers, she blooms into a more independent girl who shoulders the responsibilities of work, love, friendship, family and balance. The story may seem a little dull but it's fair to say that it's original and a great break from all of those harem anime with alien women or slice-of-life school girl comedies you've been watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama genre in my opinion should be before comedy. Looking back, I found more drama moments than comedy but that's certainly not a bad thing. Love triangles, family relationships, and the state of Kissuiso make up the drama and while the drama wasn't all too flashy but it certainly satisfied that realistc approach. While there isn't an overwhelming supply of comedic moments, the ones there are mildly entertaining. It's not split-your-gut funny but you may find a good chuckle here and there. Some may feel that it distracts from the drama but I didn't see it that way at all.\\n\\n\r\nI usually don't talk about art much but I feel that not talking about Hanasaku Iroha's art is an insult. The backgrounds were stunning. The shading, the scenery, and the animation were simply beautiful and pleasing to look at. There was clearly a lot of effort in making the scenery and I must say the art was one of HanaIro's strong points. I've seen a blog about the sites in Japan that they based off of and everything looked realistic. The character designs had a good balance and were adequately implemented in the backgrounds. Some characters look like they fit with the backdrop, like Enishi and Sui, and others fed off the anime/manga art style, looking pasted on compared to the psuedo-3D scenery, like Ohana and Yuina.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is a standard 26 episode season there is plenty of time for character development. In many anime lots of the supporting characters don't have enough screen time to grow on the audience. Sadly, HanaIro falls into that category. Even though this story is centered around Ohana Matsumae, I feel that the OTHER main characters were neglected enough to the point that they felt almost like supporting roles. Nako and Minko had a few episodes early on in the season dedicated to them, but after that they slowly faded into 2 minute segments. The other supporting roles shared a similar fate. Ultimately I felt like the different character arcs were pasted on.\\n\\n\r\nHanaIro has an assorted mix of character types. We have the general slice-of-life archetypes like the cold tsundere, Minko Tsurugi, and a more original wise old woman, Sui Shijima. The cast has a vast array of personalities which outweigh the general character types by a long shot. I haven't seen an anime with this diverse of character types in a long time. You'll have to see it for yourself to see how unique each character is. However, the characters aren't favorite material. Sure, they're very original but they don't have enough pizazz to make them stand out from other anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the events in HanaIro have excellent background music. Many people don't notice it or forget about it, but this one in particular had stellar tracks. The OST complemented the story segments very well. None of it sounded too extreme or too toned down for the situation. The EDs were very fitting and presented a calm, cleansing feel to end the episode. The OPs, on the other hand, may make you want to skip ahead to 1:30. The voices of nano.RIPE are unusually screechy and might not be the most pleasant to listen to. I loved the OPs, but I find an equal amount of fans and haters of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe love aspect of the anime constantly pops up but never seems to satisfy completely . I felt like the love triangle characters were progressing very well in the episode right until the end where it ends in a cliffhanger that shortly continues in the next episode only to be brushed aside and finished with a void.  Many have ranted at the romance for many different reasons such as the pairings, development, and execution. However, I think HanaIro's romance did its best to accommodate the realistic side of the anime. Each character that participates in the romance think deep about love and take the outcomes of their actions into extreme consideration. It's not just \"I love so-and-so so I must do my best to confess my love and make them love me as well so we can be happy together!,\" it's \"I love so-and-so but if I really confessed my love would we truly be happy?\"\\n\\n\r\nAside from the romance, HanaIro does great as a slice-of-life. It's not your usual school girls' comedy; it's a dramatic comedy that touches upon real life problems. HanaIro has the most story progression in any slice-of-life I've ever seen. Every character runs into the simple theme of \"letting go and holding on\" in their own way. During the hardships and testing decisions, the cast unfolds together as a family which gives HanaIro such charm. The rest of moments in the anime seemed awkwardly organized. It seemed like HanaIro was trying its best to hit all of the anime standards, like beach episodes. In trying to do so, HanaIro loops into a useless arc that ultimately had no purpose. Also, the latter half of the anime seemed to drag and it felt like it was trying to create more story that had no use.\\n\\n\r\nIgnoring all the nitpicking, HanaIro stands firm as a slice-of-life. Since most slice-of-life have little to no story I can easliy cut this anime some slack at attempting and mainly succeeding one. Hanasaku Iroha isn't a top priority watch, but watching it isn't something you'd regret.",

            "content": "This is my first time writing an anime review. The fact that the CV of the main character is Kanae Itou caught my attention instantly since she was also the CV of another main character of a long-run anime, Shugo Chara. I jumped into a conclusion that this anime would be good enough with just the cast but then I find many good things about this anime that makes it worthwhile to watch and even better may be one of the most interesting anime I'lll ever watch.\r\nStory: 7\r\nSince there are only 3 episodes so far, I can say that this will surely change as Iview more of the next episodes. The story is kinda plain, too simple and don't stand out among its competitors this season. But there are potentials in this anime. Reality is not that easy to handle. This anime shows us how a simple and ordinary girl who has no idea of what society really is makes her way through the ups and downs of life but at the same time enjoying herself as she faced unexpected events. It teaches us good attitudes towards work, morals and the courage to keep moving forward. How the protagonist handle all the daily activities in the inn with people both supporting her and hating her may make the story more interesting. The emotions in this anime is good compared to other animes which only shows a complicated story and nothing else. I look forward to watching more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI'm not particularly good at judging art but for this anime I'll go with a 9. The art matches the story and atmosphere perfectly. The inn was designed carefully that I could tell where is where easily. The scenery was breathtaking too. The only thing is that I already watched a lot of anime and this doesn't have any new art in it that should give it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI played the opening and ending song again and again but its not something that I can remember in an instant. Though if you'll watch the animation while listening to the music, you can somehow see a connection and say to yourself, \"It's a match.\" The main protagonist's CV has a childish and lively voice which suits it great. But some of the characters has voices that don't seem to fit the character that much. Nonetheless, it's good in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe character design for Ohana, the main character is simply cute. Again, nothing makes it stand out but I think it is the best fit for the role. With those curly hairs with a flower in each side and a small height, I won't doubt for a second that she's lively. For the other characters, it may be a little bit too soon to describe them since they seldom appeared. One more thing, their school uniform was so ordinary. Bad, because I think one of the possible forte for an anime like this is having unique uniform designs. On the other hand, they're in the country side, so it is to be expected that it is not something extravagant since it's not a fashion school or private anything.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI give it an 8. I like how it reaches a climax then suddenly here comes the ending theme. Of course, I get irritated why it has to end with that part in that episode but that's something to wait. And I enjoy thinking all the possible things that could happen in the next episode while I wait. Does it sound boring? Well, it's me after all. :D\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI think this could get higher points as the story progress. So I'll end it here for now. Thanks for reading my first ever review :DD",

            "content": "I am not the biggest fan of Mari Okada\u2019s character writing. I will give her credit. Her characters never feel mundane and many people can get emotionally invested in her cast, but those said emotions are delivered very clumsily. While she definitely isn\u2019t the worst writer in the industry, i share a common criticism with many other fellow anime fans. And that is her heavy use of melodrama. What makes it even more inferior than other attempts at drama is that they usually stem from overused plot elements such as love triangles, characters falling in love too quickly and conflict initiating from that which isa generic plot point that we as viewers have laid our eyes on far too many times for comfort. As sentimental some scenes can be, Hanasaku Iroha is definitely one of her better works. P.A. works have had an interesting time in the last decade. They have had financial success with big hits such as Shirobako and Angel beats. And a lot of their other shows sell relatively well. However on the critical side of the spectrum they have had a mixed reception. It is no secret that they have formed an identity off of their illustrious backgrounds but the only anime that has been well-received by critics is Shirobako. Nagi no Asukara received a decent reception, and as for Angel Beats and Charlotte\u2026.that is another topic for another time (see what I did there). And where does Hansaku Iroha fit into all of this?\\n\\n\r\nThe premise involves 16 year old Matsumae Ohana, a very eccentric and wild teenager who resided in Tokyo with her single mother. Due to circumstances her mother and boyfriend run away and leave Ohana on her own. She is forced to live in an inn known as \u201ckissuiso\u201d which her grandmother runs.  Hanasaku Iroha is primarily about Ohana adapting to her new lifestyle while also helping her fellow staff members in dealing with issues that can be problematic in an inn.  At first glance, Hanasaku Iroha looks like a generic teen melodrama that everyone is accustomed to seeing from Mari Okada. There is definitely no shortage of drama. The majority of the conflicts the characters face are all drama based and involve common plot threads that have been seen countless times. The drama on its own came off as very hit or miss, ranging from genuinely heart-warming to disgustingly melodramatic. Thankfully, the latter only really ever occurred once. While most might look at the series in this fashion, Hanasaku Iroha is primarily more of a story about searching for dreams, adapting to a new life and conflicts that arise in a working environment. This is what it should truly be assessed on as it is these core themes that really drive the plot along. In the first half of the show it was mostly dedicated to exploring how one can familiarize themselves with a new lifestyle through the lens of the main character Ohana. Okada did transport this to the viewer in an engaging fashion credit to its diverse an interesting cast, but what some have criticized in this execution was how improbable the personalities of the customers were and how unorthodox they behaved around the characters making the situations awkward and hard to take seriously.  It is a very understandable criticism and one that I myself also unequivocally agree with. And is the main issue that I consider to be what made the first half weak in its execution.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second half the series focuses much more character driven and delves into its other core themes. What gave made the cast so memorable and genuine was that despite them being based on hackneyed archetypes at first glance, they evolve into genuine people each with their own aspirations and fleshing out their characters by giving us an insight on how they live in and feel about their situations made them a more authentic flavour than the typical casts seen in most anime made today. Because they are not particularly involved with the main plot thread of the show that revolves around Ohana, they are more authentic by feeling like real people with their own problems that all tie back to the show\u2019s main theme of aspirations rather than being used strictly as pillars to support Ohana\u2019s goals. They are all developed very well throughout its course and their chemistry together never once makes the show feel dull. The messages the show attempts to convey through its themes is manufactured in a heart-warming fashion and told through many different scenarios that the characters are placed in. Overall it\u2019s handling of this was great. It was powerful and followed through with it all the way until the end giving catharsis in devastatingly bittersweet fashion, which left me with a painful sensation that took a while to heal.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the cast of Hanasaku Iroha they are all fairly generic when it comes to their personalities and their character traits can easily be identified in plenty of other anime. You can find all of your typical tropes present in CGDCT such as the obnoxious tsundere, the shy girl who finds it difficult to express her emotions to other people and an eccentric teenager which you would most likely have better luck finding in a shounen rather than a slice of life but nonetheless it is still a common trope, just not one you would discover in these kinds of settings.  What is impressive about this anime is how it manages to take characters that seem basic on first viewing and bring the best out of these archetypes by giving them characterization beyond the standard requirements and perfectly integrating them in the setting. They are not simply \u2018there\u2019 for the sake of it. They are there to play a part in the narrative by interacting with the setting around them, thus making them far more likeable and authentic. And as a result, the setting itself is an important part of the show. Apart from finding a path of their own to take a lot of the character\u2019s internal conflicts link to another of the show\u2019s central theme which involves coping with the different types of engagements that can arise in a working environment. The characters learn and develop through these hardships and the way these plot threads were tackled was both heart \u2013warming and insightful to learn about how conflicts that can take place in an inn can be resolved. Hanasaku Iroha went into territory that many slice of life anime don\u2019t delve in. It fleshed out it\u2019s setting wonderfully and slotted the characters into it superbly. When characters go hand in hand with a setting that feels apart of the story, it makes the characters way more relatable making their conflicts feel more important and strengthens the foundation in which they exist in. This delicately crafted backbone is what sets Hanasaku Iroha far above the majority of slice of life titles. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisually Hanasaku Iroha looks gorgeous. From the attractive character designs to the extremely detailed backgrounds, it looks as if P.A works poured in everything they could and as a result it gave the anime a sense of delicacy and luxury while viewing it. The use of CGI was definitely noticeable but not off putting in the slightest, and the character designs were crisp and never dipped in art quality. I really liked the use of the colour palette. It was bright enough to not make the viewing experience feel dull, but never felt too colourful to where it would feel like the show was throwing rainbow\u2019s in your face. It gave the show a sense of realism and helped immerse you more into the setting and supplying  Hanasaku Iroha with a nicely crafted atmospheric world. The animation was consistent all the way through its runtime and was a pleasure to watch. Its OST was used effectively to help create a soothing mood but apart from that it wasn\u2019t very memorable. I didn\u2019t really like the OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s but they did set a nice warm and fuzzy feeling. \\n\\n\r\nAs much praise as I have given Hanasaku Iroha, there are certainly elements in it that viewers will perceive as flaws. The most noteworthy one being the melodrama present throughout the anime and especially near towards the end. Some emotional moments come off as tacky and unrefined. A common trait that can be found anywhere wherever Okada has dipped her hands. They are not obnoxious enough to destroy the entire story. Only Minko is really damaged by Okada\u2019s heavy handed sentimentality as she was at some points reduced to a plot device for forced drama. Its methodical flavour at first hand can be understandably off putting to potential investment and many would easily see this as a generic \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d title with nothing to offer. However Hanasaku Iroha evolves past what it began as both from a character sense and a thematic sense making those flaws feel very inconsequential in the long run which don\u2019t hurt the series at it\u2019s very core.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI cannot deny that I thoroughly enjoyed Hanasaku Iroha and only really ever complained when melodrama was on screen. I never felt bored watching it. Its atmospheric setting combined with its gorgeous backgrounds gave me a feeling of luxury while viewing it which I have only ever gotten from Amanchu. The characters all had a sufficient amount of depth to keep me invested and always put a smile on my face when they interacted with each other. Hanasaku Iroha isn\u2019t the most intricately written anime you will ever witness, not even close to that. Nor does it have the most complex characters. But what makes it stand out is how it is able to take a mundane premise with what looks to be basic characters and bring the absolute best out of them, making all of them shine brightly throughout its run and without the need for taking shortcuts. If you liked Hanasaku Iroha for its atmosphere and charm, then I point you to Amanchu which gives off a similar feeling in terms of its delicacy but otherwise it is a completely different show. Any fan of the Slice of Life genre should definitely check this out; it is something a little different compared to the norm so it will certainly not be for everyone. And even if you are one of those people that criticize slice of life for feeling too dull and inactive. Hanasaku Iroha might have enough charm and potency to keep you glued to the screen all the way through. \\n\\n\r\nSo where does Hanasaku Iroha fit into all of this? I cannot say for certain as I have not seen all of P.A. Works\u2019 titles but I can assure you it is written far better than both Charlotte and Angel Beats.\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n",

            "content": "A wonderful, beautiful, rose colored slice of life anime. Hanasaku Iroha is the pinnacle of showing how no matter what happens, things will work out. Daily life, feeling alive, just being alive is amazing.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nThere was not much of a complete, general conflict as a whole. Hanasaku Iroha follows a naive yet energetic girl named Ohana as her setting changes drastically. Series of conflicts arise, but by her just being her, everything turns out okay.\r\nArt - 10/10\r\nCharacters are drawn without flaw, outfits are accurate, but most of all the scenery is very pleasing to the eyes, along with fitting ambient and environmental sound. Itmade me feel like I was there.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nSuperb voice acting, sound effects were top notch, the only problem I had was a bit of the music. The vocalist isn't my personal cup of tea, but fit in well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nThe character development in Hanasaku Iroha is what makes the anime so amazing. Each character is special and has many different aspects to their personality. Some you'll love, some you'll love to hate, but either way, they make this anime that much better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nI had to finish this anime in one go. I didn't know what to expect at first, but I regret nothing. So many life lessons to learn from Hanasaku Iroha. Through all the happy, sad, angry, touching, and exciting moments, I enjoyed every bit of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nLoved it. I wish I hadn't watched it so I can watch it again for the first time. Hanasaku Iroha is not your average slice of life anime at all. This has everything you'd look for in a slice of life anime: romance, suspense, drama, happiness, sadness, nostalgia, friendship. But most of all, it gets you thinking \"Bon boru-yo!\" Fest it up, get out there and be alive!",

            "content": "\"Like father, like son. Like mother, like daughter\"\r\nThere's an age old belief that certain traits are passed down from parents to children, and like most ancient convictions, there's an element of truth to this one. It's a well known fact that much of a person's future behaviour is learned during their formative years, and while it's true that children will instinctively copy the mannerisms and behaviours of the role models closest to them (which in most cases means their parents), even trained professionals and researchers can't fully explain the \"inheritance\" of less tangible traits like stubbornness, temper, perspicacity, etc.\r\nBut what does all that have todo with a show about a girl who goes off to work at a hotsprings inn? Well, not enough to be honest, and that's biggest problem.\\n\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha (The ABC's of Blooming), is an original anime from P.A. Works that tells the story of Matsumae Ohana, a 16 highschool student who, due to a variety of circumstances regarding her mother, is forced to move away from Tokyo to live with her estranged maternal grandmother, Shijima Sui, at the hotsprings inn that she owns. Knowing that she has no choice in the matter Ohana tries to make the best of her situation, and at the request of her grandmother she begins working at Kissui Inn.\\n\\n\r\nIt all sounds like a fairly straightforward set up for some teenaged melodrama, and for the most part that's what viewers will get. The plot is functional, but the anime can often have difficulty getting to the point or sticking to the storyline, and there's little in the way of originality where the narrative is concerned. In addition to this there appears to be no real direction or cohesiveness with the progression of the series, and these factors may cause viewers to wonder when the story will offer up some actual development.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, there's a surprisingly interesting subtextual thread that runs through the plot (which we'll cover in a bit), but because of the numerous issues with the main storyline it's often overlooked. The sad part is that Hanasaku Iroha would have had a much, much better storyline if Okada Mari had simply removed certain events from the screenplay and tightened up the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, some thought seems to have gone into the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nP.A. Works deserve some applause for the effort they've made in producing Hanasaku Iroha as it's easily one of the better looking anime of 2011. The artwork tends towards realism rather than the cartoonish offerings of several titles I could mention, and while this allows for some rather picturesque backgrounds and settings, there are numerous occasions where the usage of various lighting effects create some truly stunning imagery. The animation is fluid, and unlike many other shows of this type, there's a surprising range of movement for both people and animals.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are an interesting mix of styles and shapes that can sometimes appear a little plain, but in actuality there's a method to their design that may not be obvious at first glance. The thing to bear in mind is that the story takes place at a working hotsprings inn, and because of that Sekiguchi Kanami has tried to create a contrast with the picturesque surroundings.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the notable aspects of Hanasaku Iroha is the background music, or rather, the lack of it. There's a nice variety of styles on offer ranging from pastoral pieces (which in some cases sound a bit like elevator music), to upbeat little ditties, but it's the lack of musical accompaniment in many scenes that fits very well with the often quiet tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is why the number of tracks used for the opening and ending themes seem ... a little too much.\\n\\n\r\nLike many 26 episode anime, Hanasaku Iroha features two main opening and ending songs that change over at the midway point of the series. The show begins with a surprisingly well put together sequence that introduces the more prominent characters, but the track used for this, \"Hana no Iro\" by Nano Ripe, is a fairly bland piece that only works because of some good audio/visual choreography. In contrast to this closing sequence is a simple montage of Ohana and her three friends that has been set to \"Hazy\" by Sphere. From episode fourteen the opening track changes to \"Omokage Warp\" by Nano Ripe (again), which is a far more upbeat song than the previous one, and while the animated sequence is different to that of the first OP, the quality and content are pretty similar. The closing song, \"Hanasaku Iroha\" by Clammbon, is a feelgood ballad set to an animated image of Ohana and her friends, but unlike the other sequences it doesn't seem like much effort has been put into this one.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also two more ending themes, \"Tsukikage to Buranko\" (episode 6), and \"Yumeji\" (episode 8), once again performed by Nano Ripe, but there doesn't actually seem to be any real reason for their inclusion so one has to wonder why they were used in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the fact that this is a highschool drama, one might expect a degree of overemphasis when it comes to the acting, but there's surprisingly little of this in the dialogue. The script is well balanced between each of the roles, and while there are occasions where the seiyuu \"fest it up\", in general the voice actors deliver some very good performances. In addition to this there's a surprising, yet clear demarcation between the adult and teenage roles that is apparent not just in the manner of speech, but also in the language used.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the problems with the lack of direction and cohesiveness in the storyline is that it has a direct impact on the prominent characters, and this is the main reason why some viewers consider Ohana to be a very lacklustre lead role. Unfortunately, there's little in the dialogue that can actually raise her above average, and while there are clear efforts made to develop her character, these can often seem contrived or unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it's the supporting characters who really steal the show.\\n\\n\r\nFrom Ohana's mother, Matsumae Satsuki, to Kawajiri Takako, the business consultant for Kissui Inn, the adult roles are defined from the start of the series, and this makes a nice contrast to the somewhat vague characterisation of Minko, Nako and Yuina (Ohana's friends). The series also makes the effort to further develop several of the supporting roles, and because of this the subtextual thread in the plot comes to light.\\n\\n\r\nOn the surface Hanasaku Iroha is nothing more than another teenaged melodrama, but underneath it's also a story about family and role models, and that aspect of the series is far more intriguing than much of the exisitng plot. The relationship between Sui, Satsuki and Enishi forms the cornerstone of everything that happens at Kissui Inn, and unlike many other anime out there the series handles the dynamics of this in a very realistic manner. Thanks to the efforts made to highlight how each person affects the other two, several minor but key clarifications of the storyline become apparent, the most notable being the reasons for the estrangement between Satsuki and her mother, Enishi's desperate attempts to win his mother's approval and finally step out of the shadow of his sister, and Ohana's festival wish at the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha isn't as good as it could have been, but that doesn't make it bad. If one is able to tolerate the tangents in the storyline then it really is a pretty decent show at its core, and it's a fairly good depiction of working life in a hotel. That said, at 26 episodes this series really is far too long, and it can often feel like certain events or situations were added only to fill the required number of episodes. Unfortunately the detrimental effect this has on the character interactions may lead to some viewers giving up on the show entirely,\\n\\n\r\nThe sad part is that if the series had been trimmed down and the subtextual plot given more prominence, this could easily have been a contender for the best anime of 2011, but as it is right now it's nothing more than another show that joins the ranks of \"Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda\".",

            "content": "Hanasaku Iroha was in my eyes the best show of the season.\r\nThe Art is simply beautiful and the animation is definitely good for a TV series. At no point is any of the character art off model or deformed even for distant shots. Generic background people in high population scenes tend to be done in the crappy 3d which has become popular in most recent shows, however the models are properly textured to blend with the environment and main characters, though their walk animations feel a little off. This is of course only a small problem since most of the show takes place where thereare few people thus even the background people are fully animated in 2d. The colours are vibrant and really enhance the feeling of the environment. There are background shots through out the series so far which are simply stunning.\\n\\n\r\nMost scenes don't have any background music at all in this show. Save for some comedic tunes the music is saved for only the scenes that need them. When those scenes come around the music beautifully compliments the art and the animation, and gently tug at your emotions. The Opening theme is sung very well by the artist and the lyrics match Ohana's attitude and state of mind very well. The ending theme is a soothing piece which has a sort of \"It's been a good run...\" type of feel to it. Episode 11's ending was changed to match the feeling of the show at that point int he story.\\n\\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to talk about the story and characters separately as this show is entirely character driven. Not a single element in this show happens \"because that's the way we we wanted it to go.\" Everything flows smoothly as if each character was living and properly acting and reacting to the environment. The only thing even mildly questionable is Ohana's death grip on what she thinks is right. Character development for some of the minor characters feel rushed in the early episodes, however I'm willing to let that slide as it was probably to make way for Ohana's own story and there is further development with those characters later on. Her own development of course is really well written and her relationship with other characters very well scripted. I'd say these characters are definitely on the deep end of the character depth pool, Ko being the exception.  I can sum him up in 2 words; devoted and supportive. That said he is dealt with and dealt with well in season 2, so if you are distressed over the lack of development in their relationship do not despair.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I feel this is definitely a great show, and absolutely without a doubt would recommend this show to anyone who's looking for a great show with some great characters that they can seriously feel and believe.",

            "content": "I enjoy slice of life. I really do. The problem I have with them is that it\u2019s incredibly difficult to find one that isn\u2019t terrible. The two biggest pitfalls I find with the genre are the lack of compelling plots and the lack of depth as the episodes get drowned in clich\u00e9s. They often end up simply being boring as the episodes drag on to the formulaic beach/school festival/holiday routine in an attempt to entertain. Needless to say, I\u2019m usually turned off by the introduction to a slice of life anime before I can even get into the series.\r\nI watched Hanasku Iroha with massive heapsof cautious optimism. The entire premise sounded a little worrying. It tells of a teenage girl, Ohana, who experiences a set of circumstances that would send her to live and work with her grandmother, who owns and manages a hot spring inn of a small town. A hot spring inn staffed by mostly teenage girls? With that setup, fanservice seemed to be primary driving force.\\n\\n\r\nWatching the first few episodes, I was pleasantly surprised. The characters had depth and were likable. The stereotype of the doting grandmother never got played out, settling for the minor stereotype of the \u201ctough love\u201d grandmother instead. There were actual obstacles presented to the characters. The events of one episode held consequences over the next episode. And for some bizarre reason, the anime that least needed fantastic animation had some of the best animation of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe central message of Hanasaku Iroha is one about purpose. Ohana is pulled out of her comfort zone and sent into an unknown town. Here, the insecurities of her life are magnified. Here, she suddenly is faced with the uncertainty of where she wants to go in life. Here, she is forced to grow up, just a little bit. However, she embraces her new life and tries to find her place as one of the waitresses of the inn. She begins to learn more about herself, her place in life, and her family. Her resolve to face these challenges serve bring about change in the staff of the inn. Each member of the staff are faced with a crossroads on where they see themselves heading. As the story progresses, there is legitimate growth in each character. In the end, even the status quo of the inn is changed as a result of this growth with Ohana\u2019s grandmother closing the inn to allow the staff to pursue their own dreams.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best points of the series is how well they understand their audience. Each point that needs to be made is clearly made without underestimating the audience\u2019s ability to understand. They show character development and conflicts rather than telling us about it. Some of the best scenes have no words at all, something that can easily be afforded with the animation quality. As a result, the plot doesn\u2019t get too caught up in its own complications. They focus in on a situation just enough to get us tied to the characters before attempting to tug at our heartstrings.\\n\\n\r\nAs captivating and dramatic as it is, Hanasaku Iroha has its drawbacks. Remember that fanservice I suspected a few paragraphs back? It\u2019s certainly here. It never completely dominates the series, but it doesn\u2019t add anything either. My stance of fanservice is a disapproving one. I\u2019ve never felt that it\u2019s truly necessary for the female characters to disrobe for whatever reason or to include all these bath scenes. At best, it\u2019s an odd scene to inject into an otherwise good episode; at worst, it is the entire series. Thankfully, the episodes that do include fanservice use them with a decent amount of restraint. Like I said earlier, it doesn\u2019t harm the series as a whole. It\u2019s just a bit unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe romantic dramas within the series are a whole mixed bag for me. I enjoyed the drama they added and how it complicated the situation at the inn at times. Yet, the infuriating pacing and lack of closure on some of the stories really got to me. I know that the focus is supposed to be on the characters themselves while the romance is used to contrast their growth throughout the show. Then again, with the possible announcement of a second season, there should be plenty of time to flesh out those side stories in addition to showing us what the staff is up to now.\\n\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha has reaffirmed my belief in slice of life series. It\u2019s raised the bar for what will pass as entertaining and engaging and hopefully, it\u2019ll continue to do so in its possible second season. I\u2019m still going to approach these shows with cautious optimism, though. There\u2019s just too much crap out there sometimes.",

            "content": "Hanasaku Iroha Review:\r\nEverybody knows that \"void\" feeling you get when you finish a really great show. The feeling of emptiness that you feel when you finish a show that really connected with you or entertained you on a higher level. Only a few shows give you a feeling like this, and for each person the type of shows that can produce this feeling differ. For me, Clannad is the golden case of a show that gave me a void, because for months on end after finishing it, all I wanted to do was rewatch it.\r\nHanasaku Iroha is an anime that gave me my first \"void\"in quite some time.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7.2/10:\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha is a slice of life anime that follows the life of city-girl, Ohana, while she lives and works at her grandmother's inn. Like most slice of life anime, the story does not necessarily follow a focused plot, and instead finds its niche in story arcs complimented by underlying themes and a very loose main character arc. The story by no means breaks any grounds or really stands out from the crowd in terms of its concept, but its execution are what elevate Hanasaku Iroha's story from the crowd of slice of life anime. The story has many great character arcs that really get you attached to the characters. The themes in the story are also very easy to relate too. Whether its the idea of hard work pays off, the struggles of adapting to a new setting, failing to live up to your parent's expectations, or simply struggling to gain the love of the one you want, Hanasaku Iroha tackles a slew of themes that many will connect with. Because of these themes, the show can get quite emotional at times, but the characters and writing does also open the door for some entertaining comedy. I also have to point out that the homestretch of the show does provide some edge of your seat entertainment as you desperately hope to find out what happens next. Slice of Life anime tend to limit themselves on how good their story can be due to a focus on a character driven plot, and Hanasaku Iroha is no exception. However, the execution and maturity of the story are without a doubt worth recognition.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8.6:\\n\r\nP.A. Works has yet to fail to impress me with their animation quality. They always manage to bring a really cinematic feel to all their projects and Hanasaku Iroha is no exception. The character designs are all great, as well as the varied settings. There were quite a few still frames, but seeing as the show wasn't action packed, and with the lighting and colors being as beautiful as they were, this wasn't much of an issue. Really, the art is just beautiful and really helps immerse you into the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7.8:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to this show was great. The background tracks weren't really that memorable or noticeable but that was fine given the kind of laid back tone this show had. However, when the show needed to get serious or emotional, the soundtrack did shine. Additionally, I must say that the first OP is absolutely fantastic. I didn't skip it once while watching the show, and that is damn impressive for me. The voice acting was a bit up and down, but overall strong. Most of the characters were well portrayed by their VA's but there was one character that was so frustratingly annoying with her nonstop Engrish that the voice acting portion of this grade has to take a dip down. But with the overall strong voice acting, and great, but not fantastic soundtrack, I still have to give this segment a high score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8.2/10:\\n\r\nThe thing that makes or breaks slice of life shows is its characters, and I must say that Hanasaku Iroha had a splendid group of characters. The first of the notable characters I will mention is Ohana. Ohana is the main character and a very outgoing teenage girl from Tokyo. She is forced to leave Tokyo and her best friend Ko (who admitted his feelings for her before she left), due to circumstances with her mom, and is now living/working at her grandmother's inn. Ohana is a caring, hard working, and energetic girl that is extremely likeable. Next is Minko who is a chef in training at the inn. Minko is very sharp-tongued and mean, but she is also very dedicated to her craft and actually a nice person underneath her harsh words. And finally we have Nako, the timid girl who is a waitress with Ohana. All three of these girls, and really all the characters in general seem to initially fit a set, one dimensional archetype. However, the beautiful thing about this show is that every single character develops. The characters all learn new things about themselves and by the end of the show all become better, more likable people. What I think makes these characters so likable, even more-so than the outstanding development they have, is just how easy it is to relate to them, and how human they seem. They all have desires, struggles, and emotions that we all feel. The interactions between the characters can also be golden at times. The only thing holding the character section back here is the lack of a unique, stand-out type of character that you could find in some other shows like Code Geass (Lelouch), Steins;Gate (Okabe), or Haruhi Suzumiya (I wonder who). But really, with this kind of show, a more realistic main lead probably fits the role better than a wildly unique one. Oh... and Takako is pretty bad at first...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8.1/10:\\n\r\nLike I said in the into: This show gave me a void. I connected with the characters so much, that by the time the show was nearing its approach, I was feeling sad that it was going to end. Although I enjoy almost every anime I watch, Hanasaku Iroha for some reason just stuck with me better than the vast majority of others. It isn't an edge of your seat thriller like Death Note, nor is it a laugh out loud comedy like , or a non stop tear jerker like Clannad. The atmosphere of this show is actually quite laid back, with some drama and humor here and there. But because I became so attached to the characters, I couldn't help but feel a little empty when it was all over. This has become one of my favorite slice of life animes and I am so glad I decided to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7.98/10:\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha is a beautiful anime that is truly in the top tier of the slice of life genre. It is not only visually and audibly stunning, but the themes and characters in this simple show really help make it one to remember. It may not have one primary theme, story, or ability that it really owns, but it impresses in every category that a slice of life should, making for a very enjoyable experience. By the time you finish this show, you will be wishing you could rewatch it all over again like you'd never seen it before.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\r\nA wonderful slice of life that feels how it's supposed to: Real.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Beautiful animation\\n\r\n+Brilliant OP1\\n\r\n+Character development\\n\r\n+Realistic themes and struggles\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Takako...\\n\r\n- No big emotional or intense scenes\\n\r\n- Ohana x Ko \"relationship\" is poorly paced\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Hanasaku Iroha, watch...\\n\r\nNagi No Asukara:\\n\r\nAlso by PA Works with a very similar art style and similar themes of friendship and the idea that people and things all eventually change.\\n\r\nSakurasou no Pet na Kanojo:\\n\r\nAnother fantastic slice of life anime with emphasis on hard work and dedication as well as strong characters.\\n\\n\r\n7.98 - Wonderful",

            "content": "It's been a long time since I've seen a Slice of Life done well. I'm not sure what it is about Hanasaku Iroha, but it is one of the calmest anime I have seen in a long while. There's something about the series that is just very relaxing.\r\nThe story essentially revolves around Ohana, a young teenage girl, and her experiences as she works as a waitress in an inn. As the show progresses, you are able to see the blooming relationships that develop as she begins to understand herself and the people around her. The show focuses on the challenges of being a teenage girland Ohana's inner resolve to 'fest' it up no matter the situation. While there is romance, it is extremely slow paced. It will pop in from time to time to apply a dose of necessary drama to keep the audience interested in what will happen next and how it will affect each character. For a 26 episode series, I was skeptical at first of how they could achieve a balance between the amount of entertaining material and filling such a large amount of time. Much to my delight PA works really did manage to balance these two quite well. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art/Animation was good. The first opening had some choppy parts in the animation, but the animation throughout the series flowed smoothly and there's nothing to complain about here. I also found the openings and endings to be quite nice; fitting, if you will, for the show. One aspect that I felt was unnecessary here was the fan service. While it's not over the top ecchi, there are scenes that just felt out of place considering this is a slice of life drama. I'm kind of split between whether or not to criticize or praise this because on one hand the risque factor was toned down quite a lot, but on the other hand it didn't help further the show's enjoyment and wasn't necessary. \\n\\n\r\nNow going back to the bit about Hanasaku Iroha being 26 episodes. The 26 episodes really did justice to each of the characters. Each character's strengths, weaknesses, and quirks felt really defined. The pacing of the show, besides the romance, was solid and had a laid back flow. Ohana is very strong-willed and has a natural helping, outgoing personality. Minko is a tsundere that gets overly jealous and is quick to jump to conclusions. Nako is the quiet girl who's pretty much perfect yet is somehow very timid and lacks charisma. As the series progresses, each character becomes more and more likeable; you really get to see that they are all good people with good intentions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a solid, relaxing watch. If you have the time, and enjoy the Slice of Life genre, perhaps you might consider booking a reservation at Kissuiso to see what it has to offer.",

            "content": "So hey, let's talk Hanasaku Iroha.\r\nHanasaku Iroha is a 26 episode s'life drama about a bunch of teenage girls with incredibly poor listening abilities working in an inn as waitresses while trying to overcome their crippling urge to yell at everything that they don't immediately understand. Well, OK. This is a touch unfair. It's only Ohana and Minko who do this, Minko doing the yelling of the angry variety while Ohana covers the obscenely unaware side of the yelling spectrum, but most of the show is focused on these two. The thing with Hanasaku Iroha is that, asides from the drama side of things, it'shard to find any faults. The humour is surprisingly clever and never doubts your intelligence by pointing out the jokes for you. The animation is incredibly pretty. The characters are well rounded individuals who almost never fall into stereotype. It's just it's most interested in being a drama and that is precisely the area it fails at.\\n\\n\r\nFor now though, I feel like talking about the positive, specifically the one area I will throw myself to the floor in gratitude for: The humour. HanaIro isn't primarily a comedy, so don't go expecting to be struggling for breath through fits of giggles, but what jokes it does have, it never feels the need to have someone point them out for you. It recognises that you, the viewer, are an intelligent person (a rather dangerous assumption to make on behalf of the general population, it has to be said, but treat someone like they're a doofus and they'll start acting like one, self-fulfilling prophecies and all that) and recognise the humour behind Ohana constantly running away from the Heron when it blocks her path. We do not require a second character asking her why she ran away. We can see the Heron with it's freaky little beady eyes and shockingly large wingspan and fully understand why Ohana has decided to take the alternate path to prevent confronting the beast.\\n\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha assume you're intelligent enough to notice this sort of stuff in other areas too, such as symbolism. Using our friend the Heron again, there is a scene in the final episode where Ohana is confronted by the Beast again but, instead of running away like she normally does, she marches on by it. It's a symbol that she has finally gained up the courage to focus on her problems and not run around them like she usually does. Simple, but it does this without feeling the need to monologue why this scene is important. Also fanservice. It's nice to have a series where I can ogle attractive female anime characters without insulting my intelligence by hovering the camera over their underwear in case we were too busy scratching our arses to notice (apart from this one lingering shot of a wet t-shirt in episode 3, but that episode was generally retarded so we can forget about that).\\n\\n\r\nI also liked how there were little stories revolving around the minor characters in the show. Any personal conflicts that I enjoyed watching with characters tended to be any of the characters that weren't teenage girls because they were the conflicts that were treated with a sense of humour about them (and didn't yell all the fucking time). Some of them are incredibly simple, such as the head chef's Ren and his desire to become more confident. Once they had established that he gets nervous very easily, it was a reoccurring joke that he would try to man up, such as buying Yakuza jackets with a proud look on his face. Or the Beanman, the old codger who appeared in the background every now and then, who seemingly was the only person who knew how the inn worked. Personally, I'm convinced that he could make the inn sprout legs and move to a more tourist friendly area, like Howls Moving Castle, piloting the building from inside the boiler room.\\n\\n\r\nI can't go talking about the characters without mentioning Ohana's mum. MILF to end all MILF's. Absolute star of the show, particularly impressive when she only appeared for episodes 1, 12-14 and 24-26. It was only when she was around that the drama started to actually click because she had a sense of bloody humour about her own insecurities and flaws. Best scenes of the anime were Ohana's mum drinks alcohol with Ohana's granny and Ohana. Or how about Ohana's mum pretends she's going to watch porn with Ko, Ohana's bland boyfriend. Underneath the story about Ohana's growth and the growth of the other teenage girls, there's a story about her making up with her family and becoming a (slightly) more responsible parent. There's never anyone going \"LOOK GUIZ, SHE'S A BETTER PARENT NAOW\" because we can spot that for ourselves.\\n\\n\r\nI should also give some lipservice to the animation. For all their other faults, P.A. Works always have incredibly good animation and artwork. It's more of the shiny variety than the free-flowing movement of the works from Bones or KyoAni, but don't mistake this for an inability to animate movement. I found myself wondering this after a few episodes, whether I was simply being suckered in to thinking the animation was good simply because of scenery porn and attractive shiny female character designs. But no, the actual animated movement is gorgeous too. Hair moves when the characters shake their heads about. Clothes crease and fold when they move their hands. It sounds like a weird thing to focus on, but often having shiny pretty character designs hides the fact the characters are completely static, so bravo to HanaIro for that.\\n\\n\r\nBut the drama. Christ above, the bloody drama. I know teenage girls are stupid and refuse to listen to each other and get into the most irritating fights, so I guess I should congratulate them on accurately depicting typical teenage girls, but it does not make fascinating viewing. Minko deserves a mention here. She also deserves a kick in the stomach and a boot to the face and various other forms of pain. Every single damn time there's something to talk about, she gets angry and yells at everyone. I thought maybe her anger with Ohana and crush on Tohru would be a short lived thing, but it ran throughout the entire show, getting more screentime than any other plot point. Ohana isn't much better, being so braindead that she barges into every situation thinking talking really loudly and being energetic will get her through. You might be forgiven for thinking Nako is better because she's so quiet, but don't let that fool you. She solves any problems she encounters by quiet yelling, spouting off single phrases without listening to what other characters are saying. None of them bloody listen to each other or what anyone else is saying, making any dramatic confrontation lead nowhere because there's no logical process in the dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nPlus there's the fact that what they're arguing about isn't in the slightest bit interesting. Now this may be a personal thing, since I struggle to get into melodramatic anime involving minor human problems, but did you really ever care about the future of the Kissiuso Inn? Like, really? I didn't, yet they spent hours arguing over the future of the bloody place. This really dragged down in the final bunch of episodes, because that became the main talking point. I liked the characters internal conflicts with their own faults, but there seemed to be a disconnect between their own internal faults and what the issues on the outside were. This drama is pretty much my only fault with the show, but it unfortunately happens to be the central focus, so it really dragged down my enjoyment as a whole. Again though, this could be just me. If you're the kind of easily emotionally manipulated loser who thinks Ano Hana is one of the best shows of the year, then maybe you too will like the drama in HanaIro.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't like the core of Hanasaku Iroha. The drama that was like a giant gaudy painting of a fat poodle in the showroom that was meant to be the living room's centrepiece.  But I liked all the d\u00e9cor surrounding it. I liked the picturesque potted plants of the attractive animation and character designs. I liked the stylish coffee table of the clever humour. I liked the comfy leather sofa of Ohana's mum...err, don't think too hard about that final metaphor. Anyway, I liked enough of the various aspects of Hanasaku Iroha to get me passed the dull drama and enjoy the show as a whole.",

It seems by the end of the first several episodes, everything from friendship to conflicts is set in place. The story afterward enfolds in an episodic way, with no noteworthy character development or meaningful plot twists. And sadly the cuteness factor in the main character turned into annoyance. I hoped Ohana would use her perseverance to her advantage and gain some maturity, but that didn't happen.\r\nThen all the other characters stay 2-D throughout. \r\nSo even though Idid try hard to like this series, I don't think I'll be continuing it anymore. \\n\r\nPlus, now I can't even stand the opening song after they changed it.",

As her live took a turn and she started working, she realises this does not work.\r\nOhana has lived with her mother all her life and her mother is carefree and selfish. Ohana learned by her mother by words and self-experience that relying others never works. Atleast for Ohana at this time, she always ended up getting hurt. But when her mother sends her away to her Grandma's Inn to live. She is forced to work to earn her living and learns that you must rely on others since you can't do everything by yourself.\\n\\n\r\nWatching 12 episodes, Ohana meets more and more complicated situations and often tries to improve and fix these by herself when others does not act. But when she tries, she eventually fails at some point until her friends come and help her up always saying \"Why did you do it on your own?\". Story shows great love and great co-operative work and shows it well.\\n\\n\r\nArt, 10!\\n\r\nThis is seriously the one of the best if not THE best art I've seen! The art is very much detailed and beautiful. Even the backgrounds are in great detail, and no wasted efforts. \\n\r\nThe characters are beautiful and unique, I especially like Ohana's sweet and innocent but strong living look and it fits so well in to the series.\\n\r\nWhereever you look you see fine detail on all objects thru the entire series so far. It's amazing how much time they've spent on the art. Well worth the 10!\\n\\n\r\nSound, 8\\n\r\nThe opening theme is great, but not really remember-able. It's the usual you could say. Mainstream. But I guess you will (Atleast I will) recognise the song if you watch the opening every episode.\\n\r\nThe voice actor Itou Kanae does the voice for Ohana! She is a very good voice actor and performs exceptional well here. She has voiced other great series for the main character like Toaru Kagaku no Railgun, Sora no Manimani, Shugo Chara!, Kami nomi zo Shiru Sekai (The world god only knows)\\n\r\nThe background music is very well done. But here aswell, Mainstream. It's nothing wrong with it, since it does give a very good experience, but as said for opening, nothing you will remember probably.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, 10\\n\r\nThis is superb! Ohana Matsumae is a clear 10 in my perspective.\\n\r\nAt first she seems to be a normal girl with a very cute face (and the voice acting is so good and fits so well makes it even cuter) but as you watch and get to the turning point, she reveals many more sides and I actually need to watch a few more episodes before I can fully explain how she is as person.\\n\r\nShe is hard-working and determined when she want to prove she can perform well. She has a good heart and does not want to anyone take the blame for her mistakes. She does not give up, and she puts a lot of effort in to her objectives. \\n\r\nAnd one thing that keeps her going is the fact her Grandma is strict and old fashion. Her saying is \"A careless effort does nothing but harm\", and clearly, Ohana does not want to harm anyone and wants to prove her efforts are not careless.\\n\r\nThe other characters that works at the inn are very special and have their roles and personalties. Much is focused around the protagonist here, but all supporting char are VERY well done and no wasted effort.\\n\r\nAs this series is about efforts, it's only natural that this would be good.\\n\\n\r\n12 epsiodes in, more have been shown for teh supportive characters, not only Ohana and Ko-chan have lovey dovey feelings, but there is a side story going on with another romance. And secrets are being revealed with many of the side characters that just improve the story. It's very entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 9\\n\r\nSo far. I enjoyed this a lot and cant wait until the next episode. And this is probably going to be the best Anime for this season or close to it.\\n\r\nYou will feel attachment to Ohana, I've never seen a similar character and cannot think of any other character from a different series that is similar.\\n\r\nWe all have our tastes but this is a Seinen Series and the majority of people will probably like this.\\n\\n\r\nMy Enjoyment now is 10. This is superb series and I just totally love Ohana.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 9\\n\r\nIt's not a 10, even though I feel like giving it one. But well worth a 9.\\n\r\nI can tell this is ABSOLUTELY worth watching. If you don't like this, then you just don't. But I doubt any would dislike it.\\n\r\nIt has a great heart to it, and much we can learn to put in our own lives.\\n\\n\r\nIt's well made, its beautiful, it's unique in almost all aspects, I've seen 2 episodes, and going crazy. Episodes are released Sundays, so don't miss out.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let's cut to the chase, Hanasaku Iroha has its moments, but ultimately it lost its direction midway.\r\nThe story can be summarized as a group of cute girls working in an inn doing a bunch of things that normally wouldn't be interesting in real life. However this is Anime, so something like wiping the floor becomes extraordinary exciting all of a sudden and there are plenty more real life boring activities the show will make it incredibly exciting. \r\nThe other component of Hanasucku 's story are the romantic dramas. There are romantic dramas that are fun to watch, but if you have seen any romance Anime,you can figure out pretty much figure out who will end up with who. \\n\\n\r\nBy midway, Hanasaku's almost episodic nature becomes more and more boring and it didn't feel like any of the arcs were going anywhere (other than the romance ones). Watching a cute girl washing dishes while ogling at her man or  cleaning the windows early morning no longer excites the viewers. Fortunately the pace picks up near the end with all the inn drama; still, the drama was a bit cheap (not to mention forced to create a plot) in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the characters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all unfortunately either recycled characters from some other show or just plain old archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nOhana - typical pretty peacemaker, needs to get into everyone's ways until everyone is happy.\\n\\n\r\nMinchi - violent tsundere, but cute\\n\\n\r\nNakochi - timid miss perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThere is this other girl named Yuina, but I don't think she could even write her name properly, so she does not deserve a mention (oh wait...)\\n\\n\r\nThe surrounding visuals is very well done, the character designs are okay. The first opening song really fits the show, but the second opening is terrible. I also liked Michi's VA, it expresses her character well. \\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this Anime because I watched one episode per week. Had this been an Anime that was already completed, I do not think I would even pick this up. \\n\\n\r\nHanasaku isn't a waste of time, but not worth watching either.\\n",

            "content": "Like other PA works animes in the past, Hanasaku Iroha has managed to provide quite the unique experience, but this is not necessarily a good thing. If I were to sum up the idea of this anime, it could be put quite simply as learning to love your work. It is a fairly down to earth idea, and I would have been hard pressed to imagine that I would be coming into a show with such an identity crisis as this one.\r\nThe story begins with the main character Ohana being forced by her mother to move in with her Grandmother who happens to be thevery strict owner of a hot spring inn. Being forced to work for room and board, Ohana decides to do everything she can to make the most of her life.\\n\\n\r\nThe series really started out quite wonderfully as a very promising coming of age story. It had top notch visuals and had a compelling enough premise to get behind our main character Ohana as she tries to \"fest it up.\" The problem is that this show had an odd balance between trying to be a drama that could be taken seriously, and a story that often disgraced its cast in favor of some not so great comedy. This would surface as soon as episode 3 in the show where all of a sudden the show is injected with odd fanservice and the cast is beaten with a stupid stick.\\n\\n\r\nI do not have a problem with trying to have comedy in this show, but in a story that tires to take itself seriously it should never come at the expense of each character's dignity. One of the best representatives of this in the series is the character Minko, who is supposed to be a very moody, but beautiful girl with a one tracked mind of fulfilling her quest to become a chef. Unfortunately, her mannerisms and actions often lacked grace and style, so she often just came off as an unnecessarily angry and unlikable person. The balance of her character definitely became better as the show went along, but the handling of her character was pretty poor and led to several awkwardly bad moments in the series.\\n\\n\r\nStill though these problems usually came at the expense of the male cast rather than the female cast, which made Minko look good by comparison amazingly enough. Throughout the show this anime had a penchant for showcasing males to be far more incompetent at everything they do compared to their female peers. Ohana's uncle Enishi is always shown to be an incompetent fool who could never compare  in ability to his mother or his sister when it came to running the inn Kissuiso. The cook Tohru is first shown to be a serious chef, but then is often displayed as an insensitive, bumbling fool. Ohana's romantic interest in this show, Kou apparently only ever knew the method of inaction in his one sided romantic relation and preceded to waltz around in melancholy the whole time. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the female cast went, Ohana's character was the shining star of the entire show, and I would be hard pressed to find someone who actually dislikes her character. Her little phrases like \"fest it up,\" or \"sparkling\" would become trademark aspects of her character that both the cast and audience would come to love her for. A character once said in the show that the \"Kissuiso is fun because she's there\" and I could not agree more. Without her character, I doubt this show would have ever worked at all. She was a bullheaded girl who often charged into a chaotic world. She would constantly butt into people's problems and try to fix everything up. The cast would label her as inconsiderate for doing so, but this inconsideration is precisely what made her character so likable.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like some of the characters, the plot often was handled very awkwardly. The main plot threads consist mostly of Ohana's romantic troubles with Kou as she moved from Tokyo, Ohana finding a place for herself in this new life of hers as she learns to appreciate her work, and the impending crisis that is the Inn's future, both financially and in leadership. This was all clear at least by the very end, but it often got side tracked.\\n\\n\r\nSeveral of the arcs throughout the show seemed to be pointing in different directions altogether. Worst of them all was the ones involving Enishi. Several times we are led to believe that he would take leadership of the Inn, and truly lead it in a good direction only to find out that he is incompetent and incapable of doing so. Many times in the show we are shown Ohana making progress in her new life in certain arcs, but then it flips around and paints her as a distressed person who does not know quite what she wants to do coupled with huge self-esteem issues. \\n\\n\r\nThese are but two examples of the sort of backpedaling and moving forward at the same time that this show constantly treads, which really does become tiresome as it goes on. It is hard to know what the anime is quite trying to show us or tell us. Sometimes it hamfists certain messages through that are very disagreeable, and other times does not capitalize enough on the good things it's trying to tell. Despite this of course, the main message of this show always was learning to love your work, and that is something I think anyone can get behind.\\n\\n\r\nIn considering the production values of this show I must say the visuals were very good as always for a PA works show, but not perfect. I did not absolutely love the character designs, but they were not bad. The audio side of this show on the other hand had lots of issues. Too often there was a complete absence of a BGM track to set the mood and pace of this show properly. The few tracks they did have were quite forgettable.There is nothing wrong with utilizing the magic of silence in a show, but it needs to be used properly, something this show definitely did not do. \\n\\n\r\nDespite my tone, this anime was not all bad, and I definitely found entertainment throughout it even if at times for the wrong reasons.. The anime's best moments were definitely at the start, the very middle, and towards the end. There were enough highs in this series for me to look upon it sort of fondly. It was indeed a unique experience, precisely because it was such an infuriating mesh of love and hatred.\\n\\n\r\nI can justify this anime as a passable \"good\" watch, but nothing more. It was much too flawed and mishandled for me to consider it anything more. It started beautifully and ended beautifully as a series I must say, but there were many problems between the beginning and end points to drive me more than a little crazy. This leads me to believe that this show should have been 1 cour, but alas PA works seems like they have some issues on reigning in their productions properly as this is not the first example of an anime with tons of potential just not doing enough with it. I definitely would not say this anime is a waste of one's time, but it also is not something that I would jump to recommend to most people.",

It's a pretty relaxing anime to watch, and it is defiantly one of those anime that is going to leave a empty hole in your heart once you finish it, because its just that amazing.\r\nStory 10- The story overall was really good, its like any typical slice of life. Its about a girl sent to her grandmas inn because her mother runs off with her boyfriend. Like most slices of life the story doesn't follow a set orderits mostly about the hardships and changes Ohana has to deal with once see arrives Kissuiso. The story teaches about how hard work can not only lead to your happiness but others happiness to, and that in the end the work put in can really make a difference. Lets just  say if Kissuiso was a real inn, i defiantly make reservations.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10- Everything is beautifully made, and the atmosphere surrounding Kissuiso is calm but at the same time fun. The characters are look wonderful and they all fit the story perfectly. I absolutely love how Kissuiso looks, and its texture. Its a place i wouldn't mind working at that is for sure.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9- Both the openings of this anime are my all time favorites. The openings were so good that i never even thought to skipped them not even once. All the voices were perfect and the sound effects were good. There was this one women who kept speaking words in English though an it sounded really weird.Other than that the sound was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10- I loved watching all the characters develop, just seeing there emotions go crazy. I felt so bad for Ohana throughout the series always regretting her decision from the first episode i don't wanna spoil it though so i wont say anything else. Watching Ohana cope with her new life was really amazing, and watching her have so much fun while working was hilarious. Minko was another character i loved, i felt so bad for her because she could never get the one she loved to understand her feelings, and it made be sad inside. Nako was a sweet character, though timid and shy at work, she was nice and took very well care of her family. I really did love her personality. I also loved how all three characters fit so well together in this setting, and i also loved watching their friendships develop. Overall those three are a very loving cast, and have a wonderful friendship.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9- This anime was really fun to watch, and i really enjoyed watching all the characters develop. I enjoyed the beautiful scenery, and like i said before i loved the atmosphere. I honestly enjoyed this anime so much that i miss watching it, and hearing all the characters laughing while having tons of fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10- I give it 10, because in my opinion Hanasaku Iroha is a beautifully done anime. Its a really good slice of life. The characters really do make this anime enjoyable, and overall its a must watch for those slice of life fans.",

The main character is whimsical and has a childlike sense of the world, but is somewhat forced to confront the realities of what becoming an adult is like when she is forced to work at an inn. this show also refreshingly doesn't fall intoa lot of the cliche's with this type of setup. The main character is constantly thinking of her life as a story setting, and being disappointed by reality.\\n\\n\r\nGood music, good visuals/animation, interesting characters, and a believable setting are all a plus. I really wish I could write more for this review, but one episode certainly is not enough for me to say more.\\n\\n\r\nThis epside 8/10, the show has a potential to be a 9 depending on where they take the story.\\n\\n\r\nFor a plot synopsis, just click the link and read the one on this website.",

They made a slice of life drama and turned it into an anime series that I personally have trouble not watching again! I enjoyed every part of it all the way down to the romance and the really funny comedy in this show. I found the story about Ohana Matsumae to be very enjoyable to hear about. I got to see every bump in the road of a 16 year old girl's life that has a mother who she thinks doesn't care about her and focuses more on her job andfinding a husband then she does on her daughter. Ohana tries to get away from that and runs right into a grandmother who she isn't really sure she cares about her either. Through all the hard times she has of course there are good times, too. Along with moving to live with her grandmother at her hot spring inn, she gets three awesome friends and finally understands what it's like to love/like someone. Ohana's attitude made me look at life with a different outlook. She is a beautifully made main character. I am still waiting for there to be a another season or an OVA to this anime. I would love to see more of all the characters lives and how everyone is doing. If you haven't seen this anime, you are definitely missing out!",

That is when life slaps her in the face in the form of her grandmother telling her she has towork to earn her expenses.\\n\r\nFrom that point on she and all the workers at the inn are faced with different situations mostly together in the struggle it shows different situations that end up in an amusing way.\\n\r\nThe Story is not meant to impress viewers nor evolve into something greater, but give people insight in the character's everyday lives at the inn while making them laugh.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork is one of the best I've seen because of it's use of lighting to create memorable scenery and characters all while fitting the genre of the anime. Also actions like moving, speaking grunting are displayed in a continuous fashion and not by putting bits together as I have seen on other occasions.\\n\r\nThe climax of the artwork on Hanasaku Iroha are the backgrounds, very well made and at some point can even make you confuse them for reality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are designed from a similar template with added elements to customize them or are uniquely made to fit the role they are playing all while minimizing the image of a particular person and to contribute to a more authentic scene . \\n\r\nThey mostly react in a realistic way to the story by laughing getting angry falling and so on, adding to the quality of the overall work.\\n\r\nSince the story isn't what this anime is supposed to focus on you can't say there are antagonists or side characters they all blend in this environment to create in the viewer's mind a feeling of reality even if he knows it isn't.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Hanasaku Iroha is an authentic presentation of how life works and plays around with humans revealing it's two faces.

            "content": "\"All the art of living lies in a fine mingling of letting go and holding on.\" - Henry Ellis\r\nI don't think I could have found a more suitable quote for this anime. Hanasaku Iroha is an anime that takes a break from the supernatural anime and takes a more realistic approach: one that depicts what, when, and how to let go.\r\nThe story of a 16 year old girl being sent to work at a hotel may not seem very realistic but the events that happen because of it actually do. Leaving a best friend and a hometown is tough and very difficult to let go.Ohana experiences this tough change in life and begins to find a home in the hotel she works at, Kissuiso. Accompanied by her co-workers, she blooms into a more independent girl who shoulders the responsibilities of work, love, friendship, family and balance. The story may seem a little dull but it's fair to say that it's original and a great break from all of those harem anime with alien women or slice-of-life school girl comedies you've been watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama genre in my opinion should be before comedy. Looking back, I found more drama moments than comedy but that's certainly not a bad thing. Love triangles, family relationships, and the state of Kissuiso make up the drama and while the drama wasn't all too flashy but it certainly satisfied that realistc approach. While there isn't an overwhelming supply of comedic moments, the ones there are mildly entertaining. It's not split-your-gut funny but you may find a good chuckle here and there. Some may feel that it distracts from the drama but I didn't see it that way at all.\\n\\n\r\nI usually don't talk about art much but I feel that not talking about Hanasaku Iroha's art is an insult. The backgrounds were stunning. The shading, the scenery, and the animation were simply beautiful and pleasing to look at. There was clearly a lot of effort in making the scenery and I must say the art was one of HanaIro's strong points. I've seen a blog about the sites in Japan that they based off of and everything looked realistic. The character designs had a good balance and were adequately implemented in the backgrounds. Some characters look like they fit with the backdrop, like Enishi and Sui, and others fed off the anime/manga art style, looking pasted on compared to the psuedo-3D scenery, like Ohana and Yuina.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is a standard 26 episode season there is plenty of time for character development. In many anime lots of the supporting characters don't have enough screen time to grow on the audience. Sadly, HanaIro falls into that category. Even though this story is centered around Ohana Matsumae, I feel that the OTHER main characters were neglected enough to the point that they felt almost like supporting roles. Nako and Minko had a few episodes early on in the season dedicated to them, but after that they slowly faded into 2 minute segments. The other supporting roles shared a similar fate. Ultimately I felt like the different character arcs were pasted on.\\n\\n\r\nHanaIro has an assorted mix of character types. We have the general slice-of-life archetypes like the cold tsundere, Minko Tsurugi, and a more original wise old woman, Sui Shijima. The cast has a vast array of personalities which outweigh the general character types by a long shot. I haven't seen an anime with this diverse of character types in a long time. You'll have to see it for yourself to see how unique each character is. However, the characters aren't favorite material. Sure, they're very original but they don't have enough pizazz to make them stand out from other anime characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the events in HanaIro have excellent background music. Many people don't notice it or forget about it, but this one in particular had stellar tracks. The OST complemented the story segments very well. None of it sounded too extreme or too toned down for the situation. The EDs were very fitting and presented a calm, cleansing feel to end the episode. The OPs, on the other hand, may make you want to skip ahead to 1:30. The voices of nano.RIPE are unusually screechy and might not be the most pleasant to listen to. I loved the OPs, but I find an equal amount of fans and haters of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe love aspect of the anime constantly pops up but never seems to satisfy completely . I felt like the love triangle characters were progressing very well in the episode right until the end where it ends in a cliffhanger that shortly continues in the next episode only to be brushed aside and finished with a void.  Many have ranted at the romance for many different reasons such as the pairings, development, and execution. However, I think HanaIro's romance did its best to accommodate the realistic side of the anime. Each character that participates in the romance think deep about love and take the outcomes of their actions into extreme consideration. It's not just \"I love so-and-so so I must do my best to confess my love and make them love me as well so we can be happy together!,\" it's \"I love so-and-so but if I really confessed my love would we truly be happy?\"\\n\\n\r\nAside from the romance, HanaIro does great as a slice-of-life. It's not your usual school girls' comedy; it's a dramatic comedy that touches upon real life problems. HanaIro has the most story progression in any slice-of-life I've ever seen. Every character runs into the simple theme of \"letting go and holding on\" in their own way. During the hardships and testing decisions, the cast unfolds together as a family which gives HanaIro such charm. The rest of moments in the anime seemed awkwardly organized. It seemed like HanaIro was trying its best to hit all of the anime standards, like beach episodes. In trying to do so, HanaIro loops into a useless arc that ultimately had no purpose. Also, the latter half of the anime seemed to drag and it felt like it was trying to create more story that had no use.\\n\\n\r\nIgnoring all the nitpicking, HanaIro stands firm as a slice-of-life. Since most slice-of-life have little to no story I can easliy cut this anime some slack at attempting and mainly succeeding one. Hanasaku Iroha isn't a top priority watch, but watching it isn't something you'd regret.",

            "content": "This is my first time writing an anime review. The fact that the CV of the main character is Kanae Itou caught my attention instantly since she was also the CV of another main character of a long-run anime, Shugo Chara. I jumped into a conclusion that this anime would be good enough with just the cast but then I find many good things about this anime that makes it worthwhile to watch and even better may be one of the most interesting anime I'lll ever watch.\r\nStory: 7\r\nSince there are only 3 episodes so far, I can say that this will surely change as Iview more of the next episodes. The story is kinda plain, too simple and don't stand out among its competitors this season. But there are potentials in this anime. Reality is not that easy to handle. This anime shows us how a simple and ordinary girl who has no idea of what society really is makes her way through the ups and downs of life but at the same time enjoying herself as she faced unexpected events. It teaches us good attitudes towards work, morals and the courage to keep moving forward. How the protagonist handle all the daily activities in the inn with people both supporting her and hating her may make the story more interesting. The emotions in this anime is good compared to other animes which only shows a complicated story and nothing else. I look forward to watching more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI'm not particularly good at judging art but for this anime I'll go with a 9. The art matches the story and atmosphere perfectly. The inn was designed carefully that I could tell where is where easily. The scenery was breathtaking too. The only thing is that I already watched a lot of anime and this doesn't have any new art in it that should give it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI played the opening and ending song again and again but its not something that I can remember in an instant. Though if you'll watch the animation while listening to the music, you can somehow see a connection and say to yourself, \"It's a match.\" The main protagonist's CV has a childish and lively voice which suits it great. But some of the characters has voices that don't seem to fit the character that much. Nonetheless, it's good in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe character design for Ohana, the main character is simply cute. Again, nothing makes it stand out but I think it is the best fit for the role. With those curly hairs with a flower in each side and a small height, I won't doubt for a second that she's lively. For the other characters, it may be a little bit too soon to describe them since they seldom appeared. One more thing, their school uniform was so ordinary. Bad, because I think one of the possible forte for an anime like this is having unique uniform designs. On the other hand, they're in the country side, so it is to be expected that it is not something extravagant since it's not a fashion school or private anything.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI give it an 8. I like how it reaches a climax then suddenly here comes the ending theme. Of course, I get irritated why it has to end with that part in that episode but that's something to wait. And I enjoy thinking all the possible things that could happen in the next episode while I wait. Does it sound boring? Well, it's me after all. :D\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI think this could get higher points as the story progress. So I'll end it here for now. Thanks for reading my first ever review :DD",

            "content": "I am not the biggest fan of Mari Okada\u2019s character writing. I will give her credit. Her characters never feel mundane and many people can get emotionally invested in her cast, but those said emotions are delivered very clumsily. While she definitely isn\u2019t the worst writer in the industry, i share a common criticism with many other fellow anime fans. And that is her heavy use of melodrama. What makes it even more inferior than other attempts at drama is that they usually stem from overused plot elements such as love triangles, characters falling in love too quickly and conflict initiating from that which isa generic plot point that we as viewers have laid our eyes on far too many times for comfort. As sentimental some scenes can be, Hanasaku Iroha is definitely one of her better works. P.A. works have had an interesting time in the last decade. They have had financial success with big hits such as Shirobako and Angel beats. And a lot of their other shows sell relatively well. However on the critical side of the spectrum they have had a mixed reception. It is no secret that they have formed an identity off of their illustrious backgrounds but the only anime that has been well-received by critics is Shirobako. Nagi no Asukara received a decent reception, and as for Angel Beats and Charlotte\u2026.that is another topic for another time (see what I did there). And where does Hansaku Iroha fit into all of this?\\n\\n\r\nThe premise involves 16 year old Matsumae Ohana, a very eccentric and wild teenager who resided in Tokyo with her single mother. Due to circumstances her mother and boyfriend run away and leave Ohana on her own. She is forced to live in an inn known as \u201ckissuiso\u201d which her grandmother runs.  Hanasaku Iroha is primarily about Ohana adapting to her new lifestyle while also helping her fellow staff members in dealing with issues that can be problematic in an inn.  At first glance, Hanasaku Iroha looks like a generic teen melodrama that everyone is accustomed to seeing from Mari Okada. There is definitely no shortage of drama. The majority of the conflicts the characters face are all drama based and involve common plot threads that have been seen countless times. The drama on its own came off as very hit or miss, ranging from genuinely heart-warming to disgustingly melodramatic. Thankfully, the latter only really ever occurred once. While most might look at the series in this fashion, Hanasaku Iroha is primarily more of a story about searching for dreams, adapting to a new life and conflicts that arise in a working environment. This is what it should truly be assessed on as it is these core themes that really drive the plot along. In the first half of the show it was mostly dedicated to exploring how one can familiarize themselves with a new lifestyle through the lens of the main character Ohana. Okada did transport this to the viewer in an engaging fashion credit to its diverse an interesting cast, but what some have criticized in this execution was how improbable the personalities of the customers were and how unorthodox they behaved around the characters making the situations awkward and hard to take seriously.  It is a very understandable criticism and one that I myself also unequivocally agree with. And is the main issue that I consider to be what made the first half weak in its execution.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second half the series focuses much more character driven and delves into its other core themes. What gave made the cast so memorable and genuine was that despite them being based on hackneyed archetypes at first glance, they evolve into genuine people each with their own aspirations and fleshing out their characters by giving us an insight on how they live in and feel about their situations made them a more authentic flavour than the typical casts seen in most anime made today. Because they are not particularly involved with the main plot thread of the show that revolves around Ohana, they are more authentic by feeling like real people with their own problems that all tie back to the show\u2019s main theme of aspirations rather than being used strictly as pillars to support Ohana\u2019s goals. They are all developed very well throughout its course and their chemistry together never once makes the show feel dull. The messages the show attempts to convey through its themes is manufactured in a heart-warming fashion and told through many different scenarios that the characters are placed in. Overall it\u2019s handling of this was great. It was powerful and followed through with it all the way until the end giving catharsis in devastatingly bittersweet fashion, which left me with a painful sensation that took a while to heal.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the cast of Hanasaku Iroha they are all fairly generic when it comes to their personalities and their character traits can easily be identified in plenty of other anime. You can find all of your typical tropes present in CGDCT such as the obnoxious tsundere, the shy girl who finds it difficult to express her emotions to other people and an eccentric teenager which you would most likely have better luck finding in a shounen rather than a slice of life but nonetheless it is still a common trope, just not one you would discover in these kinds of settings.  What is impressive about this anime is how it manages to take characters that seem basic on first viewing and bring the best out of these archetypes by giving them characterization beyond the standard requirements and perfectly integrating them in the setting. They are not simply \u2018there\u2019 for the sake of it. They are there to play a part in the narrative by interacting with the setting around them, thus making them far more likeable and authentic. And as a result, the setting itself is an important part of the show. Apart from finding a path of their own to take a lot of the character\u2019s internal conflicts link to another of the show\u2019s central theme which involves coping with the different types of engagements that can arise in a working environment. The characters learn and develop through these hardships and the way these plot threads were tackled was both heart \u2013warming and insightful to learn about how conflicts that can take place in an inn can be resolved. Hanasaku Iroha went into territory that many slice of life anime don\u2019t delve in. It fleshed out it\u2019s setting wonderfully and slotted the characters into it superbly. When characters go hand in hand with a setting that feels apart of the story, it makes the characters way more relatable making their conflicts feel more important and strengthens the foundation in which they exist in. This delicately crafted backbone is what sets Hanasaku Iroha far above the majority of slice of life titles. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisually Hanasaku Iroha looks gorgeous. From the attractive character designs to the extremely detailed backgrounds, it looks as if P.A works poured in everything they could and as a result it gave the anime a sense of delicacy and luxury while viewing it. The use of CGI was definitely noticeable but not off putting in the slightest, and the character designs were crisp and never dipped in art quality. I really liked the use of the colour palette. It was bright enough to not make the viewing experience feel dull, but never felt too colourful to where it would feel like the show was throwing rainbow\u2019s in your face. It gave the show a sense of realism and helped immerse you more into the setting and supplying  Hanasaku Iroha with a nicely crafted atmospheric world. The animation was consistent all the way through its runtime and was a pleasure to watch. Its OST was used effectively to help create a soothing mood but apart from that it wasn\u2019t very memorable. I didn\u2019t really like the OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s but they did set a nice warm and fuzzy feeling. \\n\\n\r\nAs much praise as I have given Hanasaku Iroha, there are certainly elements in it that viewers will perceive as flaws. The most noteworthy one being the melodrama present throughout the anime and especially near towards the end. Some emotional moments come off as tacky and unrefined. A common trait that can be found anywhere wherever Okada has dipped her hands. They are not obnoxious enough to destroy the entire story. Only Minko is really damaged by Okada\u2019s heavy handed sentimentality as she was at some points reduced to a plot device for forced drama. Its methodical flavour at first hand can be understandably off putting to potential investment and many would easily see this as a generic \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d title with nothing to offer. However Hanasaku Iroha evolves past what it began as both from a character sense and a thematic sense making those flaws feel very inconsequential in the long run which don\u2019t hurt the series at it\u2019s very core.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI cannot deny that I thoroughly enjoyed Hanasaku Iroha and only really ever complained when melodrama was on screen. I never felt bored watching it. Its atmospheric setting combined with its gorgeous backgrounds gave me a feeling of luxury while viewing it which I have only ever gotten from Amanchu. The characters all had a sufficient amount of depth to keep me invested and always put a smile on my face when they interacted with each other. Hanasaku Iroha isn\u2019t the most intricately written anime you will ever witness, not even close to that. Nor does it have the most complex characters. But what makes it stand out is how it is able to take a mundane premise with what looks to be basic characters and bring the absolute best out of them, making all of them shine brightly throughout its run and without the need for taking shortcuts. If you liked Hanasaku Iroha for its atmosphere and charm, then I point you to Amanchu which gives off a similar feeling in terms of its delicacy but otherwise it is a completely different show. Any fan of the Slice of Life genre should definitely check this out; it is something a little different compared to the norm so it will certainly not be for everyone. And even if you are one of those people that criticize slice of life for feeling too dull and inactive. Hanasaku Iroha might have enough charm and potency to keep you glued to the screen all the way through. \\n\\n\r\nSo where does Hanasaku Iroha fit into all of this? I cannot say for certain as I have not seen all of P.A. Works\u2019 titles but I can assure you it is written far better than both Charlotte and Angel Beats.\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n",

Daily life, feeling alive, just being alive is amazing.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nThere was not much of a complete, general conflict as a whole. Hanasaku Iroha follows a naive yet energetic girl named Ohana as her setting changes drastically. Series of conflicts arise, but by her just being her, everything turns out okay.\r\nArt - 10/10\r\nCharacters are drawn without flaw, outfits are accurate, but most of all the scenery is very pleasing to the eyes, along with fitting ambient and environmental sound. Itmade me feel like I was there.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nSuperb voice acting, sound effects were top notch, the only problem I had was a bit of the music. The vocalist isn't my personal cup of tea, but fit in well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nThe character development in Hanasaku Iroha is what makes the anime so amazing. Each character is special and has many different aspects to their personality. Some you'll love, some you'll love to hate, but either way, they make this anime that much better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nI had to finish this anime in one go. I didn't know what to expect at first, but I regret nothing. So many life lessons to learn from Hanasaku Iroha. Through all the happy, sad, angry, touching, and exciting moments, I enjoyed every bit of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nLoved it. I wish I hadn't watched it so I can watch it again for the first time. Hanasaku Iroha is not your average slice of life anime at all. This has everything you'd look for in a slice of life anime: romance, suspense, drama, happiness, sadness, nostalgia, friendship. But most of all, it gets you thinking \"Bon boru-yo!\" Fest it up, get out there and be alive!",

            "content": "\"I'm a bud that's trying to bloom!\" - Ohana\r\nGrowing up has never been easy for anyone, and Ohana is no exception. Hanasaku Iroha, or Blossoms for Tomorrow, depicts the adventures of the young and energetic Ohana Matsumae, after she is sent grudgingly to her grandmother's hot spring inn.\r\nWhile the underlying story may not appear to be the flashiest of concepts, I cannot stress how much I unconsciously became drawn into it. And while Ohana is introduced as the main character, a rather large cast of characters all seem to get just about the same amount of screentime as her. While an overly sized character poolis often regarded as a weakness in an anime, as in many cases this results in an overall lack of character depth, however, in Hanasaku Iroha, each character goes through successes and failures in attempts to improve themselves. Hanasaku Iroha is definitely a character-driven show and by realising the dreams and desires of each one, this anime creates a truly colourful atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nGenre-wise, Hanasaku Iroha is quite the interesting combination, combining Comedy and Drama in a Slice of Life setting. Many anime have attempted similar groupings, however Hanasaku Iroha seems to stand out among the rest in the balance it achieves between the genres. There are times when you'll want to laugh and there are times when you'll tear up, and this show manages to create these moments in perfect harmony.\\n\\n\r\nWhether it be Ohana's attempts at understanding romance, or her struggles in becoming a worthy waitress at the Kissuiso Inn, there is never a dull moment in this anime. Hanasaku Iroha is definitely an anime to consider watching, as it is a show that never fails to not only get you laughing through silly things like Jiroumaru's sexual 'antics', but also questions the fundamentals of your outlook on work, love, and life itself.\\n\\n\r\nSo go watch Hansaku Iroha, and join Ohana and the zany staff of Kissuiso, at the \"place where dreams are born.\"",

As a anime watcher and lover I have seen many animes and there are quite few that make a person cry, this is one of those that have touched my heart. A mix of romance, drama and love of the workplace. The relationship between family and friends at their workplace shows their love and dedication towards their career. They give soo much feeling in what they work so hard for and why they do it. They really show how dedicated you need to be in a workplace of any sorts, as they showyou how serious they take their job. \\n\\n\r\nOhana \"main character\" is just a sweet, honest, and hardworking girl. She has to tough out the new lifestyle in labor. She soon gets a grip of it as she decides to \"rely only on herself\".

It's very realistic (well, excluding the fact not a lot of people work in a traditional inn with these certain people) in a sense that the moral is learning to love your work, and through hard work will come progress in many different mediums.\r\nAlthough I can't really relate alltoo much to Ohana, I can relate that I really wish to \"fest\" up my youth before it's gone. Even through working she finds pleasure and makes the best o fit. It really helps inspire me personally to excell in all the things I try to strive for, and that there's a big possibility of it all paying off at the end.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the character development and the way things flowed worked well. A LOT if not, most of the characters in this series got their own spotlight in the anime; and I thought they did a great job at highlighting each and every character and a little backstory to them. (Although, I wouldn't have minded a little more backstory on Bean-Man. He was probably one of my favorite characters)\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime fit in very well, and I found myself loving each and every backround track that started playing during certain scenes. It flowed together well to invoke certain emotions the scene wished to illustrate. Despite this, I'm not really a big fan of the OP since I'm not really into the whole \"screechy girl-band\" thing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, another great series to add on my list of top slice-of-lifes. I truly suggest this anime as a to-watch.",

            "content": "Having watched a variety of slice of life shows I went into this anime with some decent expectations, and despite the high average score on MAL I was disappointed and confused at the end.  The first episode starts in a formulaic drama style: spunky girl gets put into an unexpected situation with a funny cast of characters.  Add in a uptight and strict (but badass) grandma, and you are looking at a decent slice of life.  After two straight days of binging this show, I'm more confused at how it got such a high score when the story of this anime isjumbled, the characters go from lovable to hate-able, and most plots introduced relatively unresolved...  As a warning, I did not previously read the manga and this is just the random opinion of someone on the internet, but here is some reasons I thought this anime was beautifully animated garbage. -Minor Spoilers-.   First, the relationship between Ohana and her mother is awful, and while it is explored, Ohana basically sweeps it under the rug by the end of the show.  We're talking about some serious trauma that's never touched on, and when Ohana and her mother do have a confrontation her mother basically admits that she values work more than her daughter and Ohana accepts this answer.  This plot alone could have been it's own entire anime, but instead it's just a plot device they use to bring Ohana to the inn, but then decide to sloppily resolve it in the end.  I also found the relation Ohana and her grandmother initially intriguing, but they don't actually build a relationship until the end of the season. Ohana never once asks her grandmother anything about herself or her mother.  It's an employer / employee relationship after episode 2 until the end the series.  Still a heartfelt moment, but one that could have better been built over time.  I think overall the characters relationships in this anime are all hot and cold.  While each character is generally a classic anime stereotype, they all consistently hate our main character at the beginning, and then AGAIN at the end.  It was as though they got amnesia and decided to hate her again.  Particularly Minko, who I'm assuming is the waifu of the show, goes through such hot and cold attitudes towards the main character I want Ohana to slap her.  Sure, Ohana is the annoying kind of cheerful character, but having someone openly say to your face 'go die' repeatedly deserves a slap.  Or just don't be friends.  On the whole, each episode wavers between trying to be a daily look into the lives of running an inn, and full out DRAMA that just gets swept under the rug.  On the whole, I don't think this anime was awful, but the writing / character development was just scattered.  You could easily have fit the story they dished out into 13 episodes and not missed much.  Episodes 1-3 were the roughest to get through in my opinion, most scenes making go 'wtf did that just happen?' (see all of episode 3).  Maybe I'm missing something and maybe it's Maybelline.  4/10",

            "content": "\u201cSome people don\u2019t have their own dream, but, they can follow someone else's dream and make it their own someday.\u201d\r\nI\u2019m surprised as much as much as I am disappointed by the reviews of Hanasaku Iroha. Not because many of them score the show lowly, but because the reviewers seem to be criticizing the show for the wrongs things. As such, I felt obligated to write a review for what I think is an unfortunately underappreciated SoL show that is not only unique and original by nature -- but also tremendously meaningful. Hanasaku Iroha is just filled to the brim with sincere morals and messages aswell as strong, well-founded characters that -- while admittedly are a little eccentric -- should be able to relate with all viewers of the show on some level. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is simple and just generic enough to lower your expectations: Our high-energy protagonist, Ohana, is -- through unforeseeable circumstances -- forced to move in with her Grandmother, who runs an Inn under the name of \u201cKissuiso\u201d. Although the show already has a generic setup involved, it\u2019s important to look past the setup itself and instead, look at the direction the setup took the show. An Inn as a setting is already as unique as it can get, I\u2019ve certainly never seen a show set in one myself -- and the writers use this Inn to their advantage; they flesh out the mechanics of the Inn with great depth as well as realism. They explain the job of every staff member, every waitress, every chef and the Head Mistress (owner of the Inn, Ohana\u2019s Grandmother) all fairly, while subtly emphasizing the importance of all the characters. This thorough exploration of the setting familiarizes the viewer with what otherwise would seem like uncharted waters, and is able to quickly get you invested and immersed into the wonderful environment. \\n\\n\r\nThe Kissuiso Inn as a setting is not just explored and fleshed out well, it is also treated like an innate part of the character\u2019s daily life -- which it is and should be treated like. It is common for many shows, especially Slice of Life, to have a setting just because it is necessary, and never flesh it out and instead keep it as a monotonous backdrop in which the drama between the characters can unfold (e.g. ReLife, OreGairu); Hanasaku Iroha doesn\u2019t do this, instead, it uses the setting of an Inn like soil, and lets the drama bloom from it like flowers. This is a good thing, because it doesn't just respect the setting, but is also able to achieve equilibrium between two important elements: form drama that is logical (and not melodramatic), as well as further explore the Inn setting. As drama unfolds and our characters develop, the setting of the Inn is further developed as well -- driving the narrative as whole forward and forming the end point of the story. The plot progresses well as a result; as episodes go by, the characters are able to develop as well as bloom new goals and endpoints in the narrative, making the show very easy to watch and intellectually consume.\\n\\n\r\nElaborating more on the story, Hanasaku Iroha has a very enjoyable, heartfelt, and heartwarming narrative for a multitude of reasons. For a good dozen episodes or so the show deals with Ohana adapting to a new lifestyle of being a waitress at an Inn, as well as social drama that ensues with any Slice of Life. The way the show is able to express Ohana\u2019s adapting to an unfamiliar environment is through the guests that stay at the Inn; they are all overly eccentric to the point of almost being implausible. Their eccentricity proves to be very problematic, especially in the eyes of our inexperienced waitress, Ohana. Watching Ohana -- as well as her fellow waitresses -- deal with the peculiar guests they have the pleasure of serving is very hilarious, but also surprisingly meaningful; with every unconventional guest they put up with, there is a well-expressed moral attached to the resolution, making for a very enjoyable and heartwarming watch. Towards the latter half of the show, the focus shifts from her adapting to her new lifestyle (mostly because she\u2019s finally adapted) and instead casts some light on the overlooked problems present in running an Inn; the rest of the story focuses on how the characters can develop and improve themselves as well as succeed and survive with their friends and the Inn they love to work at. Needless to say, the latter half of the show is very heartwarming and puts a smile on your face; the drama is never melodramatic (albeit slightly clumsy towards the end) and the resolutions are sound and satisfactory. \\n\\n\r\nMany people criticize the show for taking detours from the main storyline, and while it may be true, it is not as overblown as people make it out to be, and nor does it detract anything from the series. The episodes that seem loosely connected to the main narrative don\u2019t exist just to run pointless circles and act as filler, but to further flesh out the main and secondary cast; this is because the characters in Hanasaku Iroha are the most important part of the show, not because it is necessarily a character driven drama, but because all the characters are the metaphysical embodiments of the morals and themes present in the narrative -- they carry and represent the very message of the narrative. The quote I pasted at the top of this review was taken directly from the show, and for the most part, it represents what the underlying theme of Hanasaku Iroha is: deep down, everyone, no matter their position or age, has something they aspire for. While the theme itself may seem generic enough, it is executed in a more than unique, satisfactory fashion by having the characters embody the theme one way or another. What is particularly different about the execution of the theme was that it wasn\u2019t written with a narrow-minded application; it never only applied to one type of person, or one specific demographic (young high schoolers), instead, it applied to everyone in the show, and I mean everyone.This wide application of the theme makes the show not only meaningful to the target demographic, but to every type of individual, which is a feature not a lot of shows can boast. \\n\\n\r\nThe large cast of characters in Hanasaku Iroha are relatable in personality and endearing in depth. I\u2019m constantly in wonderment at how the writers were able to balance an innumerable amount characters so well and fairly; literally every single character that drives the narrative forward in any way has more depth than considered passable. As long as a character can impact the narrative, they are fleshed out in as many ways as possible. The tremendous development all the characters receive is in turn able to form a cast that is not just simply likeable, but also inspiring -- we root for every character because of their likeability, and when they succeed our hearts are warmed. The large cast of characters also has another advantage, and that is the wide array of different personalities present in the cast; no two characters in the narrative are more similar than they need be, yet are similar enough to generate a sense of chemistry. The fact that the cast\u2019s personalities are so diverse and often contrasting, it allows for viewers of all types of personalities to resonate with at least one character throughout the course of the show, further increasing the emotional impact. There are several excellent characters in the show, but for length\u2019s sake I will cover my favourite.\\n\\n\r\nOhana Matsumae is a 16-year-old high energy high schooler who -- I\u2019m certain like many other teenagers -- doesn\u2019t know what she wants in life. She is the character who figuratively and titularly blooms throughout the show. The main appeal of her character is how easy it is to resonate with her; she has a multifaceted personality, but is written consistently enough to feel genuine and like a real human. Her multifaceted nature allows many kinds of people to relate with her in many ways, be it her high energy, optimistic nature; her lacking a focused ambition; or maybe even her complicated family situation. I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to necessarily call her character \u201ccomplex\u201d, because in truth she is a very simple type of character structured around an overused archetype, but it is the development she goes through and the setting she is placed in that turn her into a good character. We get to watch as her character goes through an abundance of unfamiliar hardships, from working as a waitress to making new friends and even to cutting grass. How she deals with her problems in her own way despite their unfairness is admirable and inspirational, and how she develops through her adversities is subtle and realistic. Ohana\u2019s growth as a character was definitely one of the most enjoyable aspects of Hanasaku Iroha; for anyone who seeks good character development above all, I cannot recommend the show enough, especially considering this level of exceptional development isn\u2019t solely present in her character alone.\\n\\n\r\nProduction quality is high, the animation is good enough and the character designs look unique yet realistic. The colours are usually a vivid and warm golden-brown colour palette that perfectly encapsulate the heartwarming nature and atmosphere of the show. The guitar soundtracks create a soothing feel that often gave me a warm, fuzzy feeling inside; this all further enhances the heartwarming nature. The OP/EDs require an acquired taste to like, one unfortunately I do not have (skipped every one). Aesthetically this show is going to look as good is it needs to be, there will never be any animation errors and the animation is consistent and the colours are sharp. Zero complaints from me. \\n\\n\r\nAfter all this praise, we move onto my personal and/or impartial criticisms of the show, since this show is far from \u201cflawless\u201d. The writer, Mari Okada, is notorious for her \u201cmoody\u201d shows; regardless of how good the shows she wrote are, there are almost always elements of \u201cforced drama\u201d involved one way or another (e.g. Anohana, Kiznaiver). Surprisingly, the social drama involved in Hanasaku Iroha was very subtle and never melodramatic, however, towards the end of the show (Episode 21~) it is evident that she was lacking a reasonable and logical conflict and decided to force her characters to illogically and purposefully alienate Ohana for no reason other than to spark some necessary drama. This is the part of the show that got a little irritating to watch, as the characters that felt genuine and you had learned to love and respect suddenly were turned into lifeless robots that irrationally behave for the sake of drama. The good news is that they go back to being the characters we knew and love by the end of the show, but that streak of heavy-handed drama that lasted about 2 episodes exists nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha essentially was a show that didn't just hit me on a personal level, but was also able to develop likeable and inspiring characters that are a joyous endeavour to watch interact with one another. The often subtle yet profound lines of dialogue accompanied by the memorable guitar tracks left me with a stupid grin on my face and covered from head to toe with goosebumps. I cannot guarantee that you will enjoy the show the same way I did, but I\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019t owe it to the show to recommend it regardless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Hanasaku Iroha is a heartwarming and heartfelt narrative written and produced with passion; strong, earnest characters in a unique setting embody and express moving and meaningful morals and messages that taught me more about myself than I expected to learn from watching a Slice of Life anime. The equilibrium it was able to reach between excellent, fleshed out and developed characters and a sincere narrative is simply meritorious. Even if you cannot enjoy this show as much as I did, I am certain you will come to appreciate it at least half as much as I did. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was helpful and informative. \\n",

            "content": "Okay, I'm going to keep this as objective as possible, and deter myself from breaking into an angry rant. Because I feel very strongly about this anime, and it isn't pretty.\r\nLet's begin with the good points of the anime. \r\n**PROS**\r\n--Art: 7/10--\r\nA 5/10 would be considered average, and the art is slightly above average. The scenery can be very beautiful- the train tracks, village, rain, and mountains are done beautifully. The characters have nice art, but outside from the occasional scenery, there was nothing particularly extraordinary. It was nice, that's all. The characters have nice highlights. The colors are beautiful- not too bright, and not toopale or washed out. It was aesthetically pleasing to look at, but nothing mind blowing like 5 Centimeters Per Second or Miyazaki films. \\n\\n\r\n--Music: 7/10--\\n\r\nIt was nice to listen to the music, but again, it wasn't anything too special. I liked that most of the music wasn't overly cheerful and energetic, which is often the case for shoujo anime. I didn't get sick of the opening, but it wasn't great enough that I listened to it. I skipped the opening after two or three episodes. Most of the music fits the mood and scenery.\\n\\n\r\n--Story: 6/10--\\n\r\nMediocre in every sense of the word. Now, this is neither a pro nor a con. Some people enjoy stories where every episode is basically some new, quirky adventure. The story is supposed to be about the main girl, who is abandoned by her mother and has to go to a hotel and work there in a new town, with new people. It's the sort of plot that could be great with good enough characters to make the viewer invested. While the story can be entertaining and full of laughter, it's really not 'slice of life'. There was nothing particularly deep or enlightening about this series. It TRIED to be deep a few times. It TRIED to PRETEND it was slice of life. But please. This anime is full of boring ideas. There is no real plot- every episode is about the cast getting into some cutesy adventure, really. Plot kind of starts to appear near the end, but by then, I kind of failed to care about what happened, so. Not to mention the endless plotholes in this. Overall, it's cute. It can be amusing. But don't expect anything deep or unique about this. It's something to do when you have nothing better to watch or to do. \\n\\n\r\n**CONS**\\n\r\n--Character: 2--\\n\r\nI had to think REALLY HARD about giving this a 2 instead of a 1. The issue is that this entire anime is ruined by the lack of good characters. Every character was a shallow, underdeveloped cliche with no depth or originality whatsoever. And with the storyline, you would need great characters to make the story work. But this show fails to create characters that the viewer can get behind. \\n\r\nTake a look at the main girl. Ohana. She's nothing special. She's supposed to be like some sort of Tohru, all optimistic, selfless, cute, innocent and happy-go-lucky. Do you want to know how I'd describe her?\\n\r\nBland. Generic. Lifeless. Flat. Static. Cliche. Bratty, even. I didn't find her endearing at all. She was flat and bland. She's supposed to be so positive and endearing but she was whiny, annoying, and weird. She whined and pretended to be \"so hardworking\". But we are given no background to her. Hell, she doesn't even get angry or confused when her mother ABANDONS her for e MAN. She's all, \"oh ok, cool.\" no questions asked. Ohana is someone I can neither relate to because she's set up to be perfect and loveable, but she also has no real depths, no development. She's flat. Not terrible, but...hardly real or 3-d. Even weird in a bad way. \\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are equally bad. The typical \"tsundere\" girl. The typical \"cute shy girl who is a good wife\". None of them have depth or real backstories. The main guy is tsundere and he falls in love with Ohana for no reason. \\n\r\nI also can't stand the fanservice, god help me. Do I WANT to see Ohana, who looks like she's hardly 12, prancing around in skin-tight chinese dresses that hardly cover her thighs? No, thanks. I'd go watch ecchi if I did! \\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment: 3--\\n\r\nAs you can tell, I thoroughly hated this anime. The first 3 episodes were actually okay. But quickly, I started to get frustrated and annoyed by the bland characters, meaningless story line, and overall mediocrity. It's okay if you just want to waste time and watch a light anime, but that's not what I want to invest the time of my life in. If I'm going to waste my life watching TV, I at least want it to be good, meaningful TV that gives me an enriching experience, like Nana or Fullmetal Alchemist or Madoka Magica or Angel Beats or Clannad or...you know. Things that make you see the world differently, make you cry, make your heart feel things!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I actually forced myself to finish the anime. I will never forgive myself for doing that to my poor brain. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5 (Because I know some people ARE looking for light anime with nothing special)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Genre:- Slice of Life, Romance(yes its there and not yuri), Drama\r\ntl;dr- A slice of life anime that ticks the right boxes, leaving you with a warm fuzzy feeling. If you need a healing anime and cannot really get into Aria and the likes because of less drama, this one just might be for you. It pulls your heartstrings in the first half and gives a memorable conclusion in the second. An anime that everyone should watch. Of course I cannot guarantee that you will like it or it is flawless, but then it will all depend on how much you focus on the flaws itself.Overall this is one of the better SoLs out there and the second best P.A. Works after Uchoten Kazoku.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and artwork-7.5/10(character atwork is great, use of palletes extraordinary, but it falls short of other P.A. Works in the background scenery. Some are badly drawn and blurred in 720p, filtering issues are there)\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9/10(Exemplary, could not skip the 2nd Op and ED for once, the insert songs and music greatly heighten the atmosphere, not one which I will download OSTs for, but it acted as a brilliant compliment to the anime)\\n\\n\r\nStory and coherence- 7.5/10 (Doesnt divert much from the main storyline, though sometimes goes in random direction to develop a character, overall we can call it a meandering river with small rivulets, but most of the water flows together from source to sea)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-7.5/10(4 characters obviously dont get equal development, but each is given time to develop. Even the weak link becomes completely different person in the beginning than in the end. Relationship development between two main characters are beautiful to watch, and the development of side characters top notch. I fell in love with all of them after the anime)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9/10( Something that made me not skip episodes or drop in the middle to pick up later. Hooked from first episode, and kept me in the journey till the end)\\n\\n\r\n(40.5/50=8/10)\\n\r\nNow that we are done with the ratings let me focus on some aspects of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe show initially may seem like just another cute girls doing cute things show. But no its much more than that. What I did not expect is the romantic angle to the show at all, because it wasnt mentioned anywhere. In fact the romance though subtle plays a very important part in the show, and the relationship between the lead female character and her lover reminded me of mine, so I could connect at a personal level. The lead character though is a bit absurd because she is unaware of sexual harrassment and such in the beginning and some weird things happen to her(nothing like sexual assualt and rape mind you, its actually funny), but looking at her age it is a bit too much far fetched.(But I know a few girls in real life at that age who really did not know anything about sex at that time). Anyway the lead character doesnt start off as somebody pampered and already has a strong character, so to see her molded into something better is a treat to watch. Plus the character interactions and dialogues are handled skilfully and the reactions seem totally realistic and believable.\\n\\n\r\nThe one big flaw however is the romance angle which might be argued is a bit too convenient setting and conclusion, but for my purpose its okay, no complaints I like it.\\n\\n\r\nAs with every slice of life there are plenty of quotes which will impact you. One particular thing which did for me was, this,\\n\\n\r\n\"Marriage is a promise not to let your spouse be alone, ever again. yes, even if one of you pass away first\"\\n\\n\r\nIn today's world of divorces and marriage related violence(what am I saying marriage related violence was since forever) people need to relook at the original reason for marriage. Most of the people today see marriage in a completely different light, so reading this quote brought a smile to my face. Too many people nowadays forget about this. And yes, this show shows a beautiful relationship between husband and wife as well.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that this anime does exceptionally well is using of screenplay to heighten the effect of an event. To show how an action simultaneously changes lives of two people, to use \"movement\" and \"direction\" as an allegory to their lives. And yes uses the fucking trains..\\n\\n\r\nThe ending episode, however deserves special mention. There was no miracles, yet there were many. The yakisoba guy was a badass(watch the anime to see what I mean). The setting was the bonbori festival, which made it all the more beautiful and P.A. Works could have delivererd better but they did just enough with the artwork. The OST used literally brings tears to your eyes and tears your heart off yet healing you at the same time. I dont know what the movie shows, but in my opinion this was the best ending this anime could get, it couldnt have been better.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending quote sums the anime up\\n\r\n\" I am probably still a bud,\\n\r\nBut thats why I stare up at the Sun so high.\\n\r\nI quench my thirst with water.\\n\r\nI am a bud thats trying to bloom.\"\\n\r\n~Ohana",

If such philosophy were to be uttered less often (or more consecutively) instead of cutting in during a part where one wants it least, I'd definitely give Hanasaku Iroha a 10 overall.\r\nStory: Ohana's initiation as a worker at the inn is parallel to our introduction into the working world (a factor in determining \"recommended age\"). But such initiation requires leaving something behind. In Ohana's case, it is Ko. Ko represents the audience's childhood. Because we can relate to it, the story is interesting so far. Ohana now has to deal with herco-workers. It is up to the author, now, to determine how these characters will affect Ohana and her beliefs. In all, the story is great because it can be related to and it piques our interest to know how the inn will change Ohana. (10)\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is great. I'm not an expert at art but it looks good. (10)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music was well placed -- I didn't notice the music (in a good way). The opening song is fantastic, mostly because it radiates Ohana's personality. Also, one can alter the opening song into a slow piano song, for sad parts in Hanasaku Iroha. (10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Characters nowadays lack core beliefs, unlike Ohana. Each character plays a role in Ohana's growth, and at the same time, grow themselves. Ohana questions several of her own beliefs because of the inn, and reinforces other beliefs. Such focus on character is a gem in Hanasaku Iroha.

            "content": "With each of the five big carryover shows from the spring season either ending or have ended already, I feel it\u2019s time to take a look back at the three that I could blog and do a nice, somewhat succinct review. However, with Nichijou being a slice of life comedy and thus impossible for me to sum up with anything other than \u201cIt had its moments, but the charm far outweighed the comedy factor\u201d and me being more than a week late for a timely Tiger & Bunny review (Will get to at some point though), I\u2019m stuck reviewing Hanasaku Iroha. Make no mistake though,it\u2019s not as much of a chore as I\u2019m making it out to be.\\n\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha is a quintessential coming of age story that follows Ohana Matsumae, a self-centered girl sent to live with her grandmother after her ne\u2019er-do-well mother Satsuki skips town with a man she hardly knows. Ohana heads off with lofty goals of living life like a storybook, a jaunty tune in her heart, and has the reality of staying at an inn crash down on her as soon as her stern grandmother tells her that she\u2019s there as an employee. \\n\\n\r\nThe first two episodes establish the setting, and have every character hurling verbal abuse at Ohana like she murdered a truck full of puppies after robbing the terminal disease ward of her local hospital. However, as time goes on, she adjusts to the rigors of daily waitress life, and has every single character warm up to her and her surprisingly grating attitude.\\n\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha is one of those shows that\u2019s good, but has more than enough bad to touch on and bring to light. So it\u2019s not a painful watch, and it\u2019s relatively easy to review from both ends of the spectrum, it\u2019s good fun to write about. Since the negative points are few, but important, I\u2019m going to get the less important good points out of the way to maintain some sense of cohesion. \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing anybody will notice about this series is how crisp, smooth, yet natural the animation is. I don\u2019t usually call much attention to animation, but this is seriously one gorgeous show throughout. The settings are vibrant and lively without feeling stilted and artificial, I haven\u2019t seen a single character decay into a deformed blob for the sake of comedy (Except Ohana pouting, but even that had a sort of care about it), and nothing jarred me out of the experience. Of particular mention is the occasional shot of the Kissuiso at dawn or dusk that\u2019s really some of the best use of a color pallet that I\u2019ve seen. Even if the story was complete shit, the characters unlikable and all voiced by Chewbacca, I would still say this was worth a mention on animation/design alone. \\n\r\nAlas, an anime series can\u2019t be propped up by animation alone. There has to be meat underneath the shiny veneer, substance that can really sucker the audience in. While HanaIro isn\u2019t godly in terms of story or character development, it\u2019s more than competent enough to make for an entertaining watch\u2026 at least in the second half. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the first two episodes were marvelous at establishing all the various conflicts at the Kissuiso, it stopped to a grinding halt at Episode 3 onward for the sake of half-baked character subplots. Up until around Episode 11, when Ohana takes a trip back to Tokyo to kidnap her mother and bring her to the inn, the episodes just seemed like an excuse to introduce characters while not showing exactly where they fit into the plot. But then at around the halfway point, a miracle happened, which coincided with Ohana\u2019s mother\u2019s return from Plot Absence Hell\u2014Hanasaku Iroha was good again. For the last half, it went strong until a surprisingly satisfying ending that did its best to wrap things up while not ending things on a definite note. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are, for the most part, fairly well rounded. There are a few who don\u2019t add much of anything, but most contribute to the plot in a significant fashion, and often end up likable despite their hang-ups. Satsuki and Sui, the grandmother, are still the best of the bunch, interacting with calm vitriol that\u2019s difficult to not enjoy watching.  Satsuki in particular develops with oddly noticeable subtlety, going from a free spirit who often neglected her daughter for the sake of her dreams, to a slightly less free spirit trying to live peacefully with her resentful daughter. While not many other characters get that level of development, kind of sad considering that Satsuki only had a few episodes of screen time, they\u2019re nothing to decry. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, one character has been constantly screwed out of anything meaningful, to the point that her existence has become that of an unnecessary counterbalance to the almost whimsical, yet callous Ohana. Minko is a shrill, unlikable, easily irritable bint with a noticeable hard-on for one of the main male characters\u2026 that for some reason causes her to shout at Ohana at every given opportunity. While it\u2019s easy to pick up on the jealousy, it\u2019s still a shame to have Minko go from a decent cook with no people skills to a slightly better cook with somehow even worse people skills. There wasn\u2019t an episode where I didn\u2019t want her to be taken out of the show altogether for being a living, breathing irritation. \\n\\n\r\nOne last complaint that I have is levied at Ohana\u2019s half-assed relationship with her unknowing main squeeze back home, Ko. The two can just never seem to resolve their feelings for each other, and nothing comes of it at all. It\u2019s a not so small complaint that could\u2019ve been easily solved with a little more emphasis on meaningful interaction instead of having Ohana faffing about in Ko\u2019s presence.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Hanasaku Iroha succeeds best at is developing a sense of a familial, small inn, always bustling with life. You get a sense that the world could continue on without Ohana in it, but it feels that much richer for having her around. The Kissuiso is a quaint, warm location that sees its fair share of strife along the course of the series. This is what keeps it interesting, as long as it doesn\u2019t descend into the repetitious routine of Minko yelling at Ohana for existing. \\n\\n\r\nAs can be gleaned from this, HanaIro isn\u2019t perfect. In fact, it\u2019s riddled with flaws that would keep it from being fantastic, even compared to the throngs of less able anime airing at this time. It\u2019s a gorgeously animated, gorgeously fleshed out feel-good story that has competence enough to engage the audience in small doses. While it isn\u2019t the best show of the year by any means (Though I\u2019m tempted to nominate Satsuki as one of the best characters), I recommend it for anybody searching for something somewhat different and surprisingly tender.\\n",

The main character and her growth throughout the first half of the series is absolutely masterpiece level material. Ohana is pretty much done growing by the second half and the show shifts focus to other characters and new situations that didn't connect with me on as deep a level. Nonetheless, the ending is very well done, making all of that seemingly superfluous stuff in the second half worthwhile, and every episode contributes to a better understanding ofthe characters and to the story as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was great, and fans of Non Non Biyori will recognize the artist immediately. I usually ignore lyrics but the first OP's words perfectly reflect Ohana's struggle, and the struggle of anyone who has learned to take pride in their work, so I really loved them.",

            "content": "Hanasaku Iroha is a drama about growing up that sometimes confuses itself for a silly slice of life.  This series is about a 16 year old named Ohana who has to live and work at her grandmother's traditional inn.  Now though this sounds like a slice of life, the series' strong points is its accurate depiction of teenage drama and its emphasis on the theme about appreciating work.  \r\nAfter watching the first two episodes of the show, I was almost sure that this would be one of the best shows of the year.  However, immediately after that the show delivers whatare without a doubt the worst few episodes of the entire series, taking what promised to be a great show and turning it into a show about annoying teenage antics.  This is without a doubt the worst part of this show, is that these episodes are really a pain to get through, as they are not very funny and don't have the interesting drama that the rest of the show does.  The good thing, however, is that after a few of these episodes the show transitions back to its roots and again focuses on the characters. \\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to one of the strengths of the series: the characters.  Now, the characters do take some getting used to, seeing as they are teenage girls.  Specifically Minko, who is just overly angry, and Yuina, who seems to have no real purpose in the show for the longest time.  However, even though they are annoying, there is actually some great character development throughout the course of the show.  On top of that, Ohana is actually a great lead character, mainly because she is so far away from the average teenage girl tropes.  She is loud and abrasive, but in a way it is very unique for an anime character, while at the same time portrayed very believably.  Another good point about the show is that it doesn't only focus on teenage girls, which admittedly would get pretty annoying.  Ohana's mother and grandmother also prove to be wonderful characters, and there is also realistic and interesting drama revolving around the rest of the adult cast.  In the end, the cast really does come together for a great ending to the show, and even though some of them have their annoying attributes they still play off each other well through the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nAnother one of the shows strengths is the artwork.  The character designs are all very good and consistently drawn.  However, the best part about the artwork is the background art.  The backgrounds show are beautifully drawn and greatly show the stark contrasts between the city and the countryside.  Both of these areas are drawn wonderfully and offer tons of eye candy for the viewer.  Almost every episode has at least 1 background to marvel at.  \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps my favorite part of the show was the themes it dealt with.  At its core, this show is about working, specifically taking pride in ones work.  Though this show has its share of romance and comedy; in the end this is the main point of the series.  This is an extremely unique theme for an anime to deal with and it is portrayed wonderfully.  Usually in anime and media in general, work is portrayed as the thing that is hard to enjoy, or being what keeps somebody away from their family.  However, Hanasaku Iroha shows that hard work can bring people together, exactly like the cast does here.  The show never lapses into pointless rambling about work and never gets corny or preachy like you see with other shows with a central theme.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I highly recommend Hanasaku Iroha.  Though there are certain episodes that are hard to get through, in the end it is all worth it, and the longer arcs in the show truly do have some interesting drama and character development.  And of course, the art is just breathtaking at times, further increasing the experience.",

            "content": "Hanasaku Iroha is a show that does nothing original and does everything fairly well.\r\n A phenomenal first episode was the basis of a lot of hype, and many people were disappointed when Hanasaku Iroha made it clear it intended to be a slice of life that interspersed drama and comedy rather than anything ambitious.\r\n That is an important note to make- Hanasaku Iroha is not ambitious. You have probably met characters extremely similar to Nako and Minchi before. However, the art is some of the best around, and Hanasaku Iroha succeeds in feeling more grounded in reality than many of its contemporaries. \r\n Theshow reads as a love letter to manual labour- life in a countryside inn is romanticized in a way that makes it seem like the viewer might very well wish to switch circumstances with the protagonist, before remembering how much work is expected of her.\\n\\n\r\n Hanasaku Iroha's characters feel surprisingly vibrant, and after six months of airing they were all people i'll be sad to see go. The beautiful scenery of Hanasaku Iroha encourages you to love the Kissuisso inn as much as the cast, and it is hard to watch without some attachment to the characters forming.\\n\\n\r\n The show has difficulties finding its niche- it refused to commit to being a drama, an uneventful slice of life, or a comedy. It contains elements of all three, and as a work that doesn't neatly fit a genre has perhaps not had as many fans as it might have.\\n\\n\r\n Hanasaku Iroha should not be missed by anyone interested in its premise, which it executes very well.",

            "content": "Hanasaku Iroha... PA's 2011 hit and I think it could be one of its last gems.\r\nWhy do I bother writing a review for series that aired more than 3 years already? But still, let me rant until I get the end of my satisfaction gauge.\r\nIt could be wise to rate Hanasaku Iroha's story as just \"Very Good\" but I can agree to others liking it as a 10. What Iroha does best is how it pertained life with the simplest explanations and refrained from including your everyday overly dramatical course needed.\r\nWhy, well the drama element is needed for a SOL series but Iroha does morethan the usual tear-jerking but much to the depth of how a person can adapt against the flow of life.\\n\\n\r\nWe, humans have brains. But sometimes, it is the heart that dictates most of the most urgent matters. Iroha, in my opinion settled for the latter as the main characters charges through life with their heart as their lead. It was by the obvious fact that there's really nothing special about the story. But nothing can deny that it really struck me defenseless as I find myself enjoying episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is something more MOE-oriented. Big eyes, small faces, I hope I am not making any rude gestures since the makers definitely want to struck the audience with a certain level of fanservice. But at any rate, the beautiful scenery art is more than enough to satisfy. Same as the songs, I like nano.RIPE songs. They never fail to include a meaningful lyrics not just your ordinary rhyming.\\n\\n\r\nIroha had definitely a batch of colorful characters and for me, it's their winning gem.\\n\\n\r\nOhana is just your ordinary typical young lass but she is more than your ordinary woman. She endured, endured, endured and tried to endured more than she's capable off until she blew off and threw the series into a fun-ride.\\n\\n\r\nThe series depicted Ohana as a nosy being but as far as I can tell, she's way too rational to being categorized as one. From all her experience, I could really understand the way she handles her own issues since I'm also one from a broken family, though not to her level.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series went through high and lows, Ohana still remained bright into my eyes. For me, she never wasted a single scene she's in. Her dialogues, even at random interests me and as character-driven title as good as this one, this is definitely a blessing to watch in a marathon manner.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, the other charactes are interesting as well but they were so much paler in comparison to our little heroine. Dense, pragmatic and diligent, I wish I could've met someone like this to have a small talk to get inspiration.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, my enjoyment is something vividly clear in my rant. With this kind of series, I could honestly breathe anew and released stress that cooped up inside me. This is how a SOL anime should be and I hope many others can appreciate the wonderful anime, Hanasaku Iroha.",

            "content": "Hanasaku Iroha in short is one a few SoL anime that actually manages to hold a plot and have quite a few episodes on top of it. Unlike your average SoL where most of the time it's lackadaisical laid-back and more comedy than anything, you get a direct cut out of the main characters life and what they do on a day to day basis. There are a few romantic, funny, dramatic, and out of the ordinary moments that make up everyone's lives and this show seems to aim at bringing you closer to the characters through those experiences.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story is a hard thingto describe, because it focuses on so many characters that it's in reality telling more than just one. It likes to skip around between the characters in short 2-3 episode arcs that show development of their personalities and character traits, usually focusing on one at a time with a few that centers the group as a whole. The basic underlying story is a girl from the city has to move out to the country on a short notice and ends up working at a Japanese style inn almost against her will. It's nothing too original or intensive, but its simplicity is something to appreciate because it gives a great setting to the characters to grow and develop. There wasn't a single episode where after the fact I felt like I had wasted time or it was irrelevant to the overall character progression.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art is good its nothing mind-boggling; it does what it needs to and represents the show well while remaining consistent throughout. There are no real spikes in animation quality up or down outside of the occasional still, but overall the animation is really nice and smooth. Some of the backgrounds are extremely detailed and look great; some are even stunning really. It's over average for its time and does look a bit better than even some current stuff. Even the CGI is better than a lot of shows which is a major plus for me because I usually can't stand it at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest thing that bugs me about the visuals is that here is WAY TO MANY bath scenes, like really its ridiculous. None of the scenes are done in bad taste, but its so frequent that it was a bit detracting from the story. There's no reason every time something dramatic happens that they need to discuss it in a freaking bath house. This is the single and only thing that I think should have been done significantly different. Due keep in mind though if you are reading this as someone who has yet to watch Hanasaku Iroha that while frequent they aren't over the top borderline yuri scenes, just the girls chatting for the most part (Pretty sure they never even showed a butt crack...). Its just something that annoyed me don't let it stop you from watching if you're interested.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors do a good job portraying the characters well enough, and there doesn't seem to be any parts that I would consider to be lacking. You can feel plenty of emotion where and when it's needed. All voices are distinct and fit the character designs very nicely, with no annoying voices in sight.\\n\\n\r\nMusic on the other hand is something I feel could have been a bit better. It all fits the show and its setting, but is often not even noticeable. During dramatic scenes where it's most important to convey the impact of what a character is saying it can feel lacking. I'm a very easy person to move to tears so anytime there is something emotional happening I shouldn't be having a hard time getting the water works running, but for some reason with Hanasaku Iroha I just don't feel it. I believe this to be related to the music not being impactful enough where it counts.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed both the OP's they're a refreshing change from the generic J-pop and are more melodramatic sounding rock style songs that feel nice and most of the time do a decent job setting up the feeling of the show. The ED's however I found not to be terrible, but not worth watching. Maybe I was just excited to see what would happen next, but I almost always skipped them unless the episode had ended on an emotional note.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show truly shines. There is a large cast of characters consisting of the three main girls, and the employees of the Inn. All outside of three are fleshed out and show significant progress as characters. I can't really put into words how well thought out they all are. Its a great cast and a lot happens over the 26 episodes leaving you feeling complete by the end. This is one of the few shows where I felt the characters could and might have been real people, I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9/8.5 (Rounded up for this because of the enjoyment factor.)\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part I feel this show was something original. A Slice of Life with actual life to it. The characters are all well written and believable, with common everyday things raising up in every episode that you'll be able to relate to; which is exactly what a SoL should be. Instead of high schoolers just doing random forgettable crap that's funny and/or cute we got three young characters going through the change in their life from children to adults and how the characters around them change because of it. For most of the show I forgot the main characters were even in school to begin with because so much of the plot is centered around their everyday challenges at their job. I haven't seen many SoLs that were addicting to watch and I felt like I had to keep watching especially not one that has so many episodes. It left me feeling with a sense of completeness and without questions.\\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend it to anyone who wants a SoL about everyday life instead of a boring comedy with kawaii school girls doing random shit. There's a bit of everything, comedy, romance, drama. The only people who should avoid it are those who are huge on action and nothing else 'cause that's the only thing the story lacks, only because it wasn't required for the story to be complete.",

            "content": "I like to start my reviews off with an anecdote so here's a story. When I was a kid I never did the chores around the house. I didn't think it was necessary. I always figured that my parents would do all the work. But as they got older and older I started to pitch in more around the house, and began to think of them less as chores and more as my duty. The same feeling was what I felt in Hanasaku Iroha. Despite being written by the infamous Okada(of Nagi no Asukara and Golden Time frame) the story is one that has trulytouched me. It's a story of growth, discovering yourself, and finding your own place in the world without all the stupid distractions of drama(although it is present) that clogs up other drama shows.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story of Hanasaku tells the story of a young girl who works in a traditional Japanese inn in a small town. This setting itself is both important and not important at the same time. While providing context and a background for the story to take place, the plot itself focuses on the people of the inns in the town and their various struggles and problems instead of on the setting itself. That being said, the art lends a sense of realism to the town as if it was a living, breathing thing, something that is hard to accomplish in a modern setting. But in a drama such as this the characters are the real spotlight. Almost every character has some sort of trial that they have to go through and all of these are accomplished in ways that are not only realistic in the lens they are set in(this is anime after all) but relateable in someway. The problems that all the characters face are real problems that people encounter everyday and not some lofty ideal that seems to be portrayed in most dramas. But what I'm really getting at here isn't the characters, but more so the final episode. There is a silence left in the final episode when everything is done that really left a hole in my heart, something that I haven't felt since Angel Beats over 3 years ago. Everything is silent after all the commotion of the past 20-some episodes that leaves peace, a longing that is hard to recover. It's lonely but as a viewer I knew it was for the best. And that was the best part about Hanasaku. \\n\\n\r\nArt, Sound, and Animation: As an artistic piece, Hanasaku Iroha is very pretty. The animations are well done, as are the great OPs and EDs by nano.ripe(no seriously, I love nano.ripe). As mentioned before, the art of the anime really brings out not only the inner spirit and nature of the town itself, but also the personalities of the varied peoples of it as well. It brings the inns and their people that visit them to life(which by the way is a great storytelling technique). Nothing mind blowing, but pretty regardless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As mentioned before, Hanasaku Iroha's characters are it's selling point. Throughout the show the characters always have some hurdle to overcome in some way. And as a result each and every one of them overcomes it and becomes stronger because of it. While overdone to hell in coming of age stories, it works in Hanasaku due to the strength of its characters and the relateability of each and every one of them. Almost everyone has something to offer to the viewer in terms of both thematic depth and plot and as a result no one arc is wasted. Sometimes it doesn't even feel like Okada is writing these characters.\\n\\n\r\nClosing Thoughts: I really liked this show. It's one of my favorite dramas. And I really don't like dramas. So if you like drama, if you like Japanese inns, and you nano.ripe, then watch this show. I loved it and it was one of the few shows to touch me emotionally.",

This is a real down to earth anime that isn't all bubbly and fake, but shows real issues and how they would be dealt with, in a realistic manor. Most people can relate to this anime very easily, and that's what makes it so enjoyable. Like how it's ok to have a one-sided-crush. Or how to work with others you don't necessarily like, or just working hard in general. The plot gets a little off track, but even so, each episode is still very enjoyable. The artis was actually really drew me into this anime, because most romance animes have ridiculous characters and each character doesn't look real at all (your very aware that they are anime characters). But in this show each main character is unique, and there aren't many other anime characters that look identical to them. Characters are probably the best part of this show. Each character has their own personality which is completely understandable and reasonable. I mean like when the characters get into fights, you can totally understand both sides of the arguement, and see how each character feels that way. Versus a fight when it's completely obvious that one person is right and one person is wrong. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is really good, you just have to give it a chance. :D",

            "content": "As an anime viewer who personally likes the Slice of Life (SoL) genre the most, Hanasaku Iroha was an enigma of an anime for me. At first glance, the plot seemed bland and without focus, and I had doubts about whether it was able to provide a solid and fulfilling watch. Hanasaku Iroha turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me, though it does not come without gaping flaws.\r\nBased on a personal interpretation, I've come up with two underlying themes Hanasaku Iroha tries to explore. Firstly, the anime highlights a fundamental aspect of human nature : we all seek a place where we feelvalued. Many characters in Hanasaku Iroha merely want a place where they feel needed by others, a place where they can be themselves. In that respect, Hanasaku Iroha manages to deliver motivational moments through aspects of the work of the characters in Kissuiso (the inn where they work at). We understand through the anime that working hard is important, and that striving for your dreams yields favourable results. People will appreciate you if you try your best, and this is a message that Hanasaku Iroha emphasises quite a fair bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe second theme of Hanasaku Iroha would be the courage to step out of your comfort zone. Ohana is suddenly sent to Kissuiso, where working ethic is treated with utmost importance. Her struggles and experiences show us the clear answer to a question; \"When faced with a challenge, do you sink or swim?\" Ohana is fazed by the things that come her way at first, but she eventually overcomes them to show that hard work prevails in the face of challenges. That is the power of the SoL genre : to bring across a powerful message that enlightens/impacts viewers in a positive manner.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, no anime is perfect, and Hanasaku Iroha is no exception. The melodrama, while needed in this anime, felt forced at times. One only has to recall the number of times Ohana cries over matters, whether trivial or not, in order to drive the plot and to move the story forward. Effective melodrama is when it allows the viewer to emphatise with the characters in question. In this case, it just feels hollow and superficial at times, and thus fails to achieve its intended effect.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap things up, the working life depicted by Hanasaku Iroha where hard work will bring good results is but a bed of roses, the sad truth is that real life simply isn't that rosy. However, that doesn't stop people from trying their best. Likewise, Hanasaku Iroha is a series that tries hard to bring across its intended message, but fails to do so at times. That does not make its effort any less laudable. It succeeded in resonating with me and made me think about certain aspects of life, and that, in my humble opinion, is the defining factor of an SoL series.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the unstriking yet powerful nature of Hanasaku Iroha remains an enigma, but it's an enigma that I enjoyed immensely, and it will have a special place in my list of favourite anime. If you haven't given it a try, I'd suggest it's time to fest it up!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nMany teenagers growing up start to think about the future. Whether that is furthering their education or thinking about finding a job, what someone dreams about doing is always a precious thing. In Hanasaku Iroha, the Kissuiso crew goes out of their way to \"fest it up\" in order to accomplish these dreams.\r\nSTORY\r\nHanasaku Iroha stars Ohana, a 16 year old girl who must live with in her Grandmother's hot spring, the Kissuiso, leaving Tokyo and her precious friend Ko behind.\r\nWhat transpires afterwards is a slice of life anime following Ohanas journey to growing up and realizing what shewants in her life. Throughout the show, many of the arcs would flip-flop between Ohana and one of the other cast members. I found this to be well done. It allowed not only for the growth and development of Ohana but also for many of the other crew members. Many of the arcs are \"plain\". That is to say, nothing overly exciting really happens. And that's fine; being slice of life, you should know going in that you won't be getting heavy action, drama, or even romance. Sure, there are these elements but to an extent that is realistic to the situations at hand.\\n\\n\r\nRomance does take up a sizable portion of the show, with different relationships explored here and there. It is not entirely the focus of the show, but it is prevalent enough and narratively important enough to pay attention to. In that regard, I found the romance elements to be different. The way in which the characters handled romantic feelings was not always direct, but it was interesting enough to cause you to feel certain ways for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nI don't say this for a lot of shows, but this one in particular had a very, very well done final episode/ending. I think this was mainly due to how real it felt. It's bittersweet, leaving us with a sense of not only sadness for what happened but also hope for the future. We come in to the show wary of what Ohana has to go through but we leave it being completely satisfied with how everything turned out.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nP.A. Works outdoes themselves again with Hanasaku Iroha. The show is very beautiful not only in art but in the actual animation of the characters. The characters always move fluidly and vividly, and this quality persists through every episode. I think due to their being such a small amount of actual locations that the characters visit, there is more production quality put in for the character animations.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy P.A. Works's character designs, so I enjoyed the way the characters looked and behaved.\\n\\n\r\nThe scenery itself is nice to look at. They usually stick to the Kissuiso, the surrounding village, and Tokyo, but each locale is very nice to look at and immerses you in the world more so than usual.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe crew of Kissuiso were a good bunch of characters. Ohana, Minchi, Nako, and the rest each get their time in the spotlight, as said previously.\\n\\n\r\nAbove all, Ohana was a great MC. She starts off unsure about what is to come, but over the course of the show, she learns to deal with her emotions, with her sense of duty, and with her overall goals in life. She's slightly inconsiderate, loud, and annoying at times. But at the same time, she is caring, loving, and a joy to be around. The other characters in the show not only learn to acclimate to her but through them she learns to become a better person. By the end of the show, you realize how much more mature that Ohana has become.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters were nice as well. Minchi starts off very rough and hard to approach, but over time her shell weakens (slightly!) and she too learns to confront the feelings she holds deep inside. Nako as well learns how to balance her private and public personas.\\n\\n\r\nI can keep going for each character, but I think you get the point; each starts off in a hazy area but the Kissuiso indirectly allows them to grow as characters throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nProbably my only gripe is with how the characters are handled afterwards. After a particular character is explored (besides Ohana since she is the MC), they are pretty much ignored development-wise for the remainder of the show. The most notable example is Jiroumaru who is developed as a character very early on but then forced to the sidelines for the remainder of the show. Granted, besides the main three (Ohana, Minchi, and Nako) the others are just side characters, but even Minchi and Nako fall under this effect. The growth of the characters was nice, but I wish it didn't just happen over the course of just a few episodes then forgotten about for the rest (again, the exception here is Ohana, she is explored nicely throughout the entirety of the show)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to sound, I tend to be a bit harsh. But surprisingly the first and the second OP were actually good. The EDs on the other hand are not good (just too generic, but this is usually the case).\\n\\n\r\nI didn't much care for the rest of the soundtrack. The pieces themselves were appropriate for when they were used, but nothing ever really stuck out to me.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, I felt the actors/actresses did a fine job in their roles. No outstanding performances, but I enjoyed listening to them quarrel about the everyday problems at Kissuiso. If I had to make an exception, I would give it to Enishi. I found his voice to be unique, and he did a nice job of portraying the submissive yet determined Young Master.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nSlice of life shows are interesting in that not much really happens. You do get some drama, comedy, and many other genres mixed in, but for the most part, its just the characters going about their everyday lives. With this in mind, I found the show to be very enjoyable. I would always laugh when Minchi was calling Ohana a \"balut\" (I still don't quite understand what it is, but sure!), I smiled at Yuina's carefree attitude, I liked Nako's general shyness.\\n\\n\r\nI think the show just does a good job of making everything feel like a family. The crew at the Kissuiso always have each other's backs, and it becomes apparent over the course of the show how true that statement is. It's always nice to have friends that you can really rely on, and the show gives us just what that may look like to people who have yet to find it.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, slice of life arcs with a very good ending\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, beautiful backdrops and fantastic animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, nice growth here and there with Ohana taking the spotlight\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, OPs were good but nothing else of note\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, coming of age story done right\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

Hanasaku Iroha, a \"Slice Of Life\" anime based on the main character Hanasaku Iroha did a tremendous job and made a hole in my heart. \r\nStory : 8/10\r\nThe story is great for a slice of life anime, the execution and focus of the main character's development attracts a watcher as I to continue watching to see what happens next. There's moments when its sad, and there's times when its comedic and chilling. However, some plots within the story are rather cranky. And the romance development within this series in chapters is to some degreesluggish. Still, PA did a great job on the story and managed to make it somewhat entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nArt : 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is brilliant, it reminded me slightly of Violet Evergarden but lower-budgeted. It gives you a feeling of watching a movie-budget anime, the characters, lights, effects are top notch. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the first opening of the anime. And I tend to not hear to ending because it doesn't seem to be worthy of remembrance. For the second opening, it was fine, I didn't skip it because I wanted to take my time but it wasn't as hype as the first opening. The voice acting is kind of zany  sometimes especially from that irksome woman that kept speaking English with a weird accent. As for the soundtracks, they didn't really impress me enough. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nGood, the character development of the main character was sensational and fantastic. As for the other characters, although this is a slice of life anime they also focused on a few characters such as Ohana's mother, which surprised me a little because I never knew there'd be a movie all about when she was young. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime, I cried slightly in specific episodes and it made me happy seeing Ohana progress throughout her adventure. I'd be glad to come back and perhaps watch the entire series again once more with my friends. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nHands down one of the best and underrated slice of life anime in my opinion. It feels factual and enjoyable. I recommend this anime if you are a fan of the slice of life genre. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Like most slice-of-life stories, the story isn't what you look for in a genre like this. But unlike most slice-of-life stories, character development is the major theme of this title. The story arcs venture into genres with romance and drama that is key to helping the cast develop for the better.\r\nWe are introduced to Ohana, a young girl who already shows signs of being an independent woman, who gets ditched by your typical anime-parents and is forced to move to her grandmother's inn. With the setting put into place, there is very little plot to work with throughout the show, but keeps your interest asyou learn about the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nAs the viewer is slowly being introduced to the cast, they are given a sample of this life story and their past which will further be shown as the show goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThe writers, like Hayao Miyazaki (creator of Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro and many more), wants to present female characters as strong-willed and realistic. While Ohana is still questioning on her future, she continues to work hard at the inn in hopes that she will one day find her calling.\\n\\n\r\nMinko, the apprentice chef for the Kissuiso Inn, is a prime example of a strong, ambitious and independent young girl that is mature beyond her years. Against her parents wishes, she trains everyday to fulfill her goal to become a chef.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've watched another show by P.A. Works, you know that the animation quality and character designs are second to none. The animation is beautiful and fluid that you might mistake the episodes you've watched were on Blu-ray as the animators were very thorough with each episode. Their time and sweat spent on each episode is testament to how great they wanted this show to be.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show during it's airing and I couldn't wait for each episode to come out every week. It feels like a breath of fresh air as they captured realism into their show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd have to give it a 9 which is quite high for a slice-of-life show, but it well deserves it. I've seen some call Hanasaku Iroha another moeblob anime, but quite frankly, it's not. The characters don't act cute every 10 seconds and they have a goal they want to pursue. So please check out this show whenever you can, it's not the most ground breaking show, but it will give you a more optimistic outlook on life after each episode.",

The series was effective in its implementation of coming-of-age drama focused around the everyday activity with Ohana and the workers of the Kissuiso inn owned by her grandma. Many of the characters in the series do get their focus and depth, including some episodes centered around a situation faced by a supporting character in the series. The main focus of the coming-of-age drama for the series centers on Ohana, Minko and Nako dealing with their own dilemmas of growing up with Ohana learning to rely on others and her inner conflictsabout loving close friend Ko, Minko wanting to be a master chef and dealing with her crush on a co-worker and Nako overcoming her shyness. While Minko and Nako clearly have their archetypes with the former a tsundere and the latter your typical anime shy gal, there is enough to their characters where they don't completely fall under them. The show takes its time at developing the situations faced by the three gals throughout the series through everyday, serious and comical moments.\\n\\n\r\nAs I noted in the opening sentence though, I did feel as if the show was hit-or-miss in its delivery of comedy, especially considering that Hanasaku Iroha's first two episodes had me convinced that the series was gonna be a serious drama at first. While some of the show's more subtle humor did earn me a chuckle such as some of Sui's actions, attempts that the show made at over the top humor such as Taro's erotic novel ideas and Tomoe fending off \"survival gamers\" had me wondering what the show's creators were thinking at adding those moments. Episodes focused around comedy often led to the series losing its main focus on Ohana and her friends as I wondered at points if Hanasaku Iroha was either trying to be a serious coming-of-age drama or a slice-of-life comedy. I also questioned why the show was prominently focusing on Yuina as a central character in the series even though she doesn't appear as regularly as Ohana, Minko and Nako; was not working at the same resort as the three girls; and only getting a two-episode arc focused around her character.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals to Hanasaku Iroha are great on the eyes with gorgeous and vast scenery of both the countryside in which Kissuiso is located and the city environment of Ohana's home of Tokyo. There is plenty of detail and lush colors conveyed through both rural and urban settings in which Ohana and other characters travel through in their everyday activity. While animation isn't the prominent focus of the series, characters were moving about at a smooth pace through walking, working at Kissuiso and traveling in vehicles; thus I didn't feel as if the series resorted to any shortcuts when it came to animation, especially during some scenes featuring crowded areas such as a Bon festival held at the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wasn't as big on the show's comedy, Hanasaku Iroha did still entertain me with its drama and focus on the coming-of-age trials faced by Ohana and her two close friends working and living at the Kissuiso inn. It's not the best anime I've seen by a long shot, but it is definitely worth a look if you dig slice-of-life and coming of age titles.",

If you stick through it and see into everything there is things I wished that were changed. There were other moments I really liked. I enjoyed the characters and their relationships too. It's about teenagers and how their lives can drastically change by others. Mostly that's all I'd say trying not to spoil but, I did like this anime and if you think you would too then I recommend it.

And I've felt like I must make a quick review of it.\r\nThis anime is the exact lesson I should learn when it comes to being an otaku--never have high hopes for something which started incredibly good. I am a ghibli fan, and the first episode really reminded me of Spirited Away. That's why, at the back of my mind, I thought that wow..omg..this anime looks so promising..maybe it will be epic! But as I watched the preceding episodes, my high hopes are beginning to collapse. The fillers can also drag the whole story down, you know?\\n\\n\r\nSo I ditched it out of my ongoing-anime-priority watch list. I just recently continued watching it because of the sudden developments in the love triangles of Minchi, Tohru and Ohana. It became more exciting because Ko-chan was shown again in the anime. But as other MAL formurers had said, once the plot has been full of ups and downs, the general feeling of the audience will not be the same as before.\\n\\n\r\nIt could have been better it they made it 11-12 or 13 episodes. Maybe through that they could really show the real beauty of this coming-of-age anime--that it's not just beautiful characters and sceneries.",

            "content": "I am not going to pretend that this is an unbiased review. I will say it up front: I loved Hanasaku Iroha! I found it compelling, radiantly beautiful, tender, endearing, and intensely satisfying. Now for the breakdown:\r\nArt: The first thing that will strike you in this anime is the art, in particular the background artwork. From the very first episode, the artwork was astounding in its depth of detail and realism. There were scenes that, as a professional photographer, I would have been proud to have captured their like in a photo, and it was hard to tell they were not photos! The portrayal ofeverything from the city streets, the passing scenery from the train, to the quaint and pastoral tourist village where the main portions of the show take place were rendered with exceptional care and quality.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The place where the show comes the closest to not performing is in the story. It is a slice-of-life tale, which is not to everyone's liking. I happen to like them when they are well done, because they concentrate on things like character development and the relationships of the individuals involved and I get caught up with the characters, feeling like they are people that I know. This is where Hanasaku Iroha really drew me in...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Yes, the characters are the real prize here. In particular, the growth of those characters over the 26 episodes and the realism of the relationships between them. There are one or two \"clunkers\" in the batch, the perverted writer and the strident management consultant who drops English phrases like they are the names of celebrities that she knows personally stand out, but most of the characters are well wrought. The protagonist, Ohana, is a particularly well done character. She grows from a fairly shallow girl with unrealistic expectations of life, to a strong young woman who knows where she is going and how far she has yet to go. There is similar development in many other characters, with time spent on each as you get to know and love the lot of them. \\n\\n\r\nSound and Music: Excellent for the most part, the only downside I found was the original ED, which I liked well enough when listening to it, but found it unmemorable in the long run. The various OP, ED, and insert songs by Nana.RIPE were well done, some to the point of hummable infectiousness. The incidental music and sound effects were all well done, adding emphasis to the story and knowing when to let the natural background noises hold court to emphasis a moment or simply carry the mood.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is one of my favorite shows. It may fade as time goes by, but fresh off the end of the show, I find it a wonderful series that I will look back on fondly and purchase on BluRay if it becomes available here. The ending was a marvel for anime, in that it didn't try to magically resolve all of the issues and chose a realistic ending that, while a bit bittersweet, left you feeling like the characters lives were on the track they belonged on to get where they want to go. That was really the touchstone of the series. Realism. There were some contrived circumstances and typical plot mechanisms in play, but the way the characters interacted and developed had a strong sense of \"rightness\" about it. The characters seemed like real people and interacted in realistic ways that brought them to life. In the end, this sense of familiarity with the characters is what brought me back from week to week and makes me feel that I will miss them now that I am out of their lives. In fact, the sense that I am out of their lives and not the other way around is the strongest indication of how well the writers did their job.\\n",

            "content": "To start things of, Hanasaku Iroha, im proud to say, is the best anime of the season. The development of the characters was just incredible.The songs are really catchy, The art is superb, and did i mention that the humor was surprisingly good? \r\nThis anime gives you this kind of mix feeling while watching each episode. One time you could be mad at the situation or feel bad about it and can weep for days. (well, for me that is...) But it'll want you to continue to watch more and can drive you insane for the next episode. Throughout the anime, you will have thosemoments where you can hear yourself giggling or laughing out loud. The comedy here in the anime comes where you least expect it which is a good thing. The word \"Hobiron\" kept me going for days with a smile on my face and that expression on Ohana's face, priceless. \"the best things come when you least expect them too\" right? \\n\\n\r\nThe art was really splendid. The scenery of each place tells how much effort the creators put into the anime. It's like all the beautiful painting coming together and creating this one big masterpiece.Also the inserted songs blended in so well with the art and the timing of the scenes. The inserted songs really was a good add showing either what is happening or what the few episode afterward is going to be about. When you start listening to the inserted songs in the anime, you'll feel an impact in your heart and just want to cry. A really emotional anime basically.\\n\\n\r\nThe situational scenes as in characters getting into conflicts really develop the story. It could change a character thought and feeling toward one another which help the characters in Hanasaku grow. One time they'll be getting into a fight, then later you'll see them make up. The characters do have those little fights in between, but it show how life really is like. It also show life's problem, as in living with a parent who doesn't support you as much as other parents, or being alone and working when you are young. You might hate it in the beginning but you have to grow up sometime and take responsibilities. Everyone have a certain age to grow up even though you're not an adult. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum up this review, Hanasaku was a really good \"Slice of life\" anime. This anime always make me think about life and the future. Thinking, \"what i should do from now on\" and \"what i should be taking granted for\". Not all children are as lucky as the others. Also this anime shows me to keep believing in my dream. Too never give up on it and to live it out to the finest. Keeping you dream alive is what helps you throughout life. Guiding you to what makes you happy. This anime show that if you work as hard as you can, and to make un-breakable bonds with the people you love, There will be nothing to fear about losing your dreams. You will have those sad moments, But please, make the best you can and always enjoy you life to the fullest! Bonboru~\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cI\u2019m a bud trying to bloom\u201d- Ohana\r\nThe challenges and adversity that people face throughout life, especially as an inexperienced teenager, at first hinders their ability to move forward. However, through the process of overcoming these obstacles these individuals are able to better understand themselves and begin to grasp what they truly desire in life while finding a sense of belonging in the world. Hanasaku Iroha uses the common struggle to attain meaning in ones\u2019 life as the foundation of the story and develops it through an enthusiastic and strong willed girl, Ohana. \r\nStory: 8\r\nHanasaku Iroha describes a very simple story that revolves around the maincharacter, Ohana, who is forced to work at her grandmother\u2019s inn called Kissuiso due to unfortunate circumstances. Despite having a very simple premise this anime was able to captivate my attention from the very beginning as the atmosphere of the anime is very refreshing. The slice of life genre is usually underestimated at first because it is difficult to maintain the audiences\u2019 interest through a story of watching the main character simply grow as an individual. This genre usually does not have any major plot twists, epic battle scenes, anything flashy, or any other type of method to immediately captivate an audience. But what it does have is the ability for the audience to easily connect with the storyline, and more than often we are able to see a reflection of ourselves in certain characters. Watching this anime felt like a breath of fresh air as the refreshing story, summer setting, friendly and caring characters, and beautiful music all blended together to set the perfect mood for the audience. Every aspect of this story comes back in portraying how Ohana grows as an individual in order to finally begin life with a purpose, which she is able to attain while working in Kissuiso, and watching this journey was very peaceful and emotional.  Unlike most anime that revolves around high school students, Hanasaku Iroha was able to maintain a sense of maturity which provided the audience with a chance to better comprehend certain themes of love, friendship, family, and individuation. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5\\n\r\nThe character development for a slice of life anime is usually the strongest aspect, as the ability for the audience to form a connection with the characters is what maintains our interest. The anime is centered on Ohana\u2019s journey to understand her goals and aspirations, and as her name suggests her ultimate goal is to bloom into a beautiful and unique flower. Despite most of the focus towards developing Ohana it does not detract from the main purpose of the story\u2014to portray the strong bonds that holds a family together, and in this case the workers at Kissuiso. Ohana\u2019s development is driven from her ability to easily form strong and lasting bonds with others, and this is used to bring everyone at Kissuiso together in order to create a very warm and loving atmosphere. One of my favourite characters in this anime is Koichi, who is introduced to be Ohana\u2019s lover as he confesses his love in the very first episode. Sadly Koichi does not receive much development throughout the anime as he only appeared in few episodes. However, his ability to provide Ohana with a stable support throughout her many obstacles creates a very genuine and refreshing relationship between them and this always kept me wanting more. Ohana\u2019s two friends that she first meets at the inn are Minko and Nako, and both of these characters complemented each other\u2019s personalities very well which elevated the level of their development. Minko\u2019s struggle to become acknowledged by the one she loves and Nako\u2019s journey to accept her quiet and timid personality provides the audience with more opportunities to find connections with characters, and this further captivates the audience. Despite the fact that a single characters does not particularity stand out absolutely does not undermine character development, instead it allows for the topic of family to be better understood.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9\\n\r\nSimilarly to other anime produced by PA Works, Hanasaku Iroha\u2019s animation is very attractive, beautiful, and in a sense soothing to watch. Every now and then in the anime there were scenes that would simply put me in awe due to the various techniques the animators used to elevate the art style. Another strong point of this anime is the amount of intricate detail that was incorporated into the backgrounds, primarily the nature landscapes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe sound beautifully reflected the overall cheerful and refreshing atmosphere to the anime through the various soundtracks, opening themes, and ending themes. However, I think that certain opening and ending themes is an acquired taste due to them being slightly different than the usual J-pop music, but I feel that this adds to the very rustic and original impression of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI recently  re-watched this anime and when finishing I felt excited for knowing that I will watch this again sometime in the future, because I was completely drawn into the uplifting and inspirational story. For those who find it difficult to establish a sense of meaning in their life and would like to better understand themselves as individuals, this anime provides them with some insight. For those who simply want to watch something that will put a smile on their faces, this anime will definitely do so. Hanasaku Iroho is special to me because I was able to learn that every person has a different way of overcoming adversity in order to finally reach an understanding of their innermost aspirations; and when this becomes clear they are able to finally \u201cbloom\u201d. \\n",

            "content": "As others have said, this anime starts off incredibly well. In fact, if you leaf through initial reviews (when people had only watched the first few episodes), there are a lot of proclamations that this was a strong contender for anime of the year. And initially, it was - the main character was uniquely compelling in the way that she was jaded about city life and her environment. While walking around a sunset-drenched Tokyo in the first episode, Ohana talks about how boring she finds the city and its scenery. \r\nThat's pretty different from most female slice of life protagonists, who are your typical \"WHEEI'M SO HAPPY ABOUT EVERYTHING : DDDDD SUNSETS ARE BEAUTIFUL YAY!!!!\" stereotypes. So in the first few episodes, you're basically watching this intriguing, interesting girl (who doesn't know anything about herself) struggle as life throws her some crazy curveballs. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this all goes away. I'm not sure exactly what episode it was, but at some point I was watching and suddenly said to myself \"Wow, she's acting completely out of character.\" And sure enough, for the remainder of the show, Ohana is your typical anime heroine - she's overly cheerly, constantly smiling, and whenever one of her friends is feeling down, you can be sure she'll provide a snap-monologue that makes them immediately feel better. \\n\\n\r\nThat was a huge disappointment. : / However, if you can get through that unfavorable character shift, there's still an enjoyable anime to be had here. I won't spoil anything, but there's an arc in the middle of the show that manages to keep you hooked, and the finale's very well done and actually made me get a little emotional. \\n\\n\r\nHeck, don't get me wrong. I liked this anime from start to finish. However, I was so bummed about Ohana's character going from this jaded Tokyo teenager to a super-positive cheerleader that it kind of marred everything else. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're a huge fan of slice of life (as I am), then this show's definitely worth checking out. You may find yourself bored from time to time, but like any good slice of life, you'll also be sad when the final episode ends and you realize you won't be allowed to visit this little world anymore.  If you're not really into the genre, though, and were just considering watching Hanasaku Iroha because you'd heard good things, then you might not end up enjoying this. As I've said several times now, it's main flaw is that it transforms the main character from a really compelling, unique person into one that we've all seen dozens of times before, and does so without any logic, reason, or character development behind it. (Seriously, if you watch the first four episodes you'll know what I mean, suddenly she's just acting totally different.) \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, as a big slice of life fan I gave this a 7/10. It's not up there with the best of the best, like Beck, Genshiken, or Toradara, but it's also not a bad place to spend some time. : )",

            "content": "From the beginning, Hanasaku Iroha immediately sets itself apart from other typical shows within the same genres. The show seems to be aware of the tropes and conventions that are usually tied to romance comedy dramas, and so it actively differentiates. Instead of the classic lead up to a love confession, Hanasaku Iroha hits you with one in the first episode, letting the viewer see the aftermath rather than the rising action. When Ohana leaves Koichi without an answer, she changes the fish out of water scenario that would be the first act.\r\nYou see, the story is that Ohana has to depart from her motherand their home in the city to go work for her grandmother\u2019s traditional Japanese inn out in the country. Normally this might be a chance for a fresh start, to meet new people and start a new life, and without Koichi that\u2019s all this would\u2019ve been. But because of her ties to him, she\u2019s left grappling with her feelings and her regrets. Ohana hadn\u2019t completely abandoned Koichi, but she did leave both of them in an incredibly confusing place. She still has his number so they eventually text each other again, yet they\u2019re not quite sure where they stand.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s this relationship with Koichi that ultimately shows her growth as a person. Ohana doesn\u2019t necessarily grow from her connection with him too much, but what they have is a clear effect of what Ohana learned from her family and her work. Their relationship is able to grow because Ohana is, and her mistakes are just a marker of who she is at that point in time. An example would be when she thought she could just move on from Koichi, thinking that he would eventually get over her and move on as well. What she was neglecting was her own feelings, as well as the fact that she left him without an answer. How could Koichi move on without being properly rejected and why would Ohana want to live with that regret when not trying seems so opposite to the nature she had working for Kissuiso?\\n\\n\r\nThe romantic drama between these two is only part of the overarching plot though, and it\u2019s not part of the average day to day in which most of this series takes place. Ohana needs to first learn the way the Kissuiso inn operates and what her place in that operation is. The grand rule of the inn is to always serve their customers with the highest degree of dedication and effort, and so as a maid, Ohana has to cater to every need, even for the more eccentric guests. Through her hard work, she starts to feel a connection to this inn and a thriving motivation to withhold its standards, so much so that she\u2019s willing to do crazy things like crash a wedding or listen to a certain guest\u2019s drafts of their erotic novels.\\n\\n\r\nMostly, Ohana grows through her bonds with her coworkers, friends, and family in and around the Kissuiso. They teach her and of course she teaches them. Sui (madam manager) teaches her how to have passion in your career and the importance of putting the customer above all else. Enishi, her uncle and heir of Kissuiso, is a classic example of willpower, never giving up despite his near constant failures. Nako is an embodiment of exceptionalism, being great at her job while dealing with the shortcomings of her shy personality. Minko shows how (or how not) to handle frustration. And every other main character demonstrates an important life lesson as well.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s really interesting is seeing how Ohana changes their lives, mainly with her positive attitude and ability to sort of save the day with her brash and short sighted actions. Whether it\u2019s crashing weddings to find the cook that Kissuiso is in desperate need of, or fighting clearly biased review scores of their inn, Ohana is always ready to take things a step too far for the things she cares about.\\n\\n\r\nAnd somewhere down the line, that thing is the Kissuiso. Maybe she threw herself into her work because of the drama with Koichi, maybe she just found out she had a natural gift with inn labor. Point is, Ohana began to love this place she worked at, and so at around the half way mark this show became less about adapting to a new environment and more about finding your place in the world/loving where you\u2019re at right now. Ohana comes face to face with the reality that she isn\u2019t a person with some sort of grand dream, a goal that she decided. So instead of having her own dream, she followed someone else\u2019s and made it her own.\\n\\n\r\nThis where she, and really everyone around here, starts to really change as a character. She isn\u2019t really about big melodramatic attempts to save the day by the second half of the series, and this is due to a number a reasons; one being a certain shift in her relationship with Koichi, another just being that she learns from her mistakes and sees that when she sets out to do something it never really ends the way she wants it to.\\n\\n\r\nBut the other characters are the ones that truly shine in the second act, with almost all of them getting their own arc. Change is blatantly evident in characters like the madam manager, who was first introduced as a strict and violent innkeeper to a woman more willing to take risks and open up. Others like Nako come to grips with who they are, and while they don\u2019t change as much as characters like Sui, they do become conscious of who they are as people. Ultimately, the arrival of Ohana is a learning experience for everyone involved.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from the heavy details, I\u2019d like to talk a bit about the comedy of Hanasaku Iroha. At times, I\u2019d find myself laughing quite hysterically at the sheer excellence of a well-timed joke. Other times I\u2019d find myself shaking my head in disapproval. No, Hanasaku Iroha is not a perfect show by any stretch, and one of the reasons for that would be the hit-and-miss variety of gags it tends to dish out. Mainly, the show occasionally makes itself appear too hokey with off-tone antics that only end up feeling weird and cartoonish. At times, the show literally uses a slide whistle. It comes out of nowhere and has virtually no setup, but for some reason a poorly cobbled joke shows up and wastes about a minute or less screen time. These gags aren\u2019t hard to shrug off, mind you, but it\u2019s strange and unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Hanasaku Iroha is an incredibly fun and heartwarming show. Ohana, alongside her friends/fellow employees work hard and wrestle with things like love and loss in their pursuit to understand where they truly belong. While a little forced at times, the humor of this is usually impeccable and (like real life) is much needed to get through hard times.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the OPs and EDs are amazing.",

It's not without its flaws as well.\r\nStory/Characters-8/10\r\nThe story itself seems simple enough at first, but as we learn more about characters we really get to know the real story of this anime, which are the characters. The characters are very diverse but are all linked to the inn in which they work and love. There is a character for everyone (mostly :P)!\r\nA lot of people complain about the romance and fanservice parts, but I feel like it wasmoderate and well put in the plot and episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8/10\\n\r\nThe art is very good as well, with nice details in some places, but I've noticed that some scenes are repeated multiple times in the show, but it's almost not noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7/10\\n\r\nThe sound is good, albeit nothing special. There are a couple of songs (with subs) during difficult and important moments but it didn't really leave anything in my memory. While I'm talking about sound, the OP and ED aren't really that good imo. Maybe it's just my music taste, but I don't like 'em.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall-8/10\\n\r\nThe length of this anime is great, with 26x23min episodes. It is a perfect amount for us to really get to know our characters and their own stories we and they go through.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's the problem itself. The anime was very good indeed, but it wasn't great. There's a lot that happens, but nothing really special happens in it, which is disappointing and the ending itself left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth as well.",

It had good ideas going for it and at times I could really sympathize with the characters, however, themajority of this journey suffered from a prolonged pacing which made me disinterested in watching more than a single episode at a given time. \\n\\n\r\nI had so much trouble giving my full attention to this show that I often felt like dropping it because I couldn't care less about what followed any episode I'd previously watched.  \\n\\n\r\nThe anime was really pretty however and had gorgeous backgrounds. The sound quality was also really good, with a catchy intro to motivate several repetitions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall however, I wouldn't recommend this show unless you've had a meaningful work experience at some point in life or appreciate the effort it takes to create anything worthwhile.

I'm sorry but he just suck, \\n\r\nI would have preffered Tohru x Ohana (a crack) since at least that has a reason of happening aside from a confession out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nalso the romance has no chemistry, Ohana x Ko , Minko x Tohru Yuina x Yosuke.. they all suck I'm sorry.\\n\\n\r\nanyways the romance is not a big deal of the story so....CM PUNK !!\\n\\n\r\nSound & Animation\\n\r\nOkay for first and foremost everything is Similar to Tari Tari (although I said it since I've watched Tari Tari first) from the art & sound, and I love that they showed it on a countryside scenery\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty relaxing and I like how the balance the colors and the brightness, there is less fanservice though but still It's pretty cool\\n\\n\r\nthe first opening is the only one I like the 1st end 2nd op and end eh didn't really mind it, I guess It's because I don't mind about art and sound that much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nwell I did enjoy it, especially the mian characters despite their less screentime I enjoyed the secondary characters particularly Yuina, Jiromaru & Tomoe\\n\\n\r\nOverall Hanasaku Iroha is a series that It touches you in the heart, though not in an emotional way but you'll learn some lessons in life though It still has flwas particularly in the cringing romance.\\n\\n\r\nI would suggest you watch it, It's probably, I think everyone would enjoy this, especially those who just wants a simple drama anime\\n\\n",

You delve into the thought processes of the characters,  begin to understand why they work, learn their flaws, backgrounds, and their personality quirks. \r\nThis show really reflects the hard work ethic of Japanese culture, and emphasizes the satisfaction earned through it. The notion of putting others above yourself is a running motif. If anything, you are inspired to work towards something while watching this show.

When it made jokes about pedophilia and suicide within the same episode, I knew we weren't going to get along. I tried to stick it out, but the running humor about teenage girls turning all men into perverts was just too much. Any semblance of a storyline that could have kept me with the show just reeked too much of overdone, slice-of-life plots, and it was one of many shows that leftme starved for new ideas. It is very possible that if I had stuck with the show, the characters could have developed in an interesting way, but there are just so many things more worthy of time and investment.",

However after a reluctant viewing of the first episode I was hooked. The thing that struck out to me the most was the art and movement of the characters, now in some animes you will find that some movements are skipped because they are focusing on a detailed drawing of the characters expression yet Hanasaku Iroha managed to create the flow that is necessary in my opinion for an excellent anime.\r\n All ofthe characters held a very clear background as well this shows that the writers and directors have thought about the development of the story and this makes it more than just the classic romance/work anime. I also found that the romance in this story left you hanging by a thread at points, rooting for one couple then the next minute shipping another pair, this was due the sheer amount of information packed into each episode, leaving little room to wonder on anything else. \\n\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha to me vacant an enjoyable anime that proved to show the true essence of working life whilst at the same time showing the troubles high schoolers have to go through at the same time. It shows how to get a good thing in life you need to work hard for it, even if you don't achieve your intended result as is in Hansaku Iroha. \\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend you watch this is you are interested in a slice of life anime. \\n\\n\r\nBrokenBook Reviews",

            "content": "Hanasaku Iroha, I will divide this review into two so they coincide with the two halves of the anime.\r\nAhem, Hanasaku Iroha is about a girl named Ohana Matsumae, a girl that all through her young life was taught by her mother to be self-efficient and act on her own which led her to mature quickly in a direction that she later realizes is not what she wants to be. As she starts to learn how to work she takes that opportunity to reinvent herself as she is relocated away from her home town due to family circumstances. Little does she know that this route shehas been forced to would make her into one of the most developed characters I have ever seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the anime centers around Ohana as she slowly works into the rhythm of working from dawn until dusk along with a strict manager. Ohana's co-workers provide advice whenever she comes up short or caused a mishap on the job and she really takes their advice to heart and learns from her mistakes. One thing she learns very early on in the anime is that her actions could spell trouble for others and on some occasions bring them down whenever she makes a mistake. Upon learning certain things Ohana connects them to her old life in the city and wonders if she would make the same decisions again and if she were to change them, in what way would she do it?\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters in the first half are not given much attention and are thus overshadowed by \\n\r\nOhana's overpowering progress in developing her character.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot stress how much I enjoyed the first half because Ohana's character development in superb! Ohana goes through many obstacles as well as tiny bumps that really helped sculpt her nearly perfect character.\\n\\n\r\nThe Second half of the anime heavily centers on the other characters in an attempt to save them from underdevelopment. While it was a great second half I could not help yearning for Ohana to make an appearance and learn something new. As it took awhile for the second half to hook me back into the show without the help of Ohana, I learned that in that time the other characters were subtly sparking in their own special way and were still figuring out things in their own lives as well as wondering if they would want to change their future. Ohana begins to be the center of the anime again once the anime starts to move toward the last couple episodes.\\n\\n\r\nNow every character in the second half has had their chance to sparkle (with the exception of one character) and are now viewed in a new light with the addition of a greatly developed protagonist that still finds moments to chisel her slightly rough features leftover from the first half until she achieves the self she's always wanted.\\n\\n\r\nThe art overall was very detailed with soft colors that really complimented the peaceful little town that the anime takes place majority of the time; However, the city scenes were not complimented by this as much but received more detail to balance out.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music to Hanasaka Iroha greatly complimented the show. I looked forward to the openings as they sounded that of a small town and reflected Ohana's go-getting optimistic character.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, This anime is a must watch for older audiences as there are a lot of real life elements introduced in the show. I enjoyed this anime extensively as it got me thinking for weeks upon finishing it. The anime does come along with a movie (Hanasaku Iroha: Home Sweet Home) that explores the young life of Ohana's mother as well as Ohana's perspective of her mother having changed towards a better direction than it was before. A perfect addition to the series itself. I hope you enjoy the experience that is Hanasaku Iroha as much as I did and thank you for taking your time reading this review as there was a lot to cover. See you next time MAL members.",

For me, it is something that I looked forward to watching every day after college and I was never disappointed. 26 episodes and not one of them were anything below excellence. \r\nThe characters are wide ranging in personality and none of them feel 'skirted over' in the slightest. Both the opening and the closing themes were really well suited to the anime along with the \"in episode\" tracks. I found the plot to be enthrallingand far more varied than the standard, predictable slice-of-ife that are all too common.\\n\r\nEven if I had the vocabulary of a literary genius, I would still be at a loss as to how I could truly give this show the praise it deserves. How much I wish there was another 26 episodes or more!",

With each passing episode, we get to know them just that little bit more & by the end, its hard to imagine that they were once just that little name we saw on myanimelist\\n\\n\r\nI liked the OPs & EDs & as always, I looked forward to the halfway mark where the songs change. The background music is quite noticeable when it does go on and helps with the pacing of each scene (It's 26 eps so the little piano tunes will begin to sound repetitive after a while) \\n\\n\r\nJust your ordinary slice of life with a bit of zing.

In the end I ended up having a good time watching what happens every day in Kissuiso and this strange group of workers.\r\nThe story and the manga are almost identical (except with a couple of minor details), although the 5 volumes are consumed in just a couple ofepisodes, about the argument I think has the exact dose of comedy and belongs to the genre \"coming- Of-age. \"\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fine, but could be better, the lighting and textures are somewhat opaque in certain scenes but it is nothing that negatively affects the anime or causes problems to enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack is very varied, appear some singers already known as nano.RIPE and Sphere. The two opening I liked quite and go very well with the anime. Background sounds are also correctly set.\\n\\n\r\nFor me the characters are the strong point of the anime, what I like is that they are not the typical characters \"cliches\" of the Slice of Life, we have a protagonist who has enough charisma to make you have a good time, the grandmother who Is not the typical \"tender granny\" but rather someone demanding and authoritarian, the rest of characters have different personalities that help make the story more fluid.\\n\\n\r\nFinally all this made me enjoy a good story with a good time, if you are thinking about seeing it I would advise you to read the manga first, if you like then you are ready to enjoy the 26 Chapters of this good anime.",

I can't recall why I rated it a 7, but after I re-watched this anime once again, I still stand in favor for it. \r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story is okay, I can't say if it's either cliche or oddly normal. I mean Ohana, our protagonist at the beginning, is suddenly going to move from the city Tokyo to the country-side of Japan. \"Haven't heard that before!\" \r\nYes, it's pretty normal and there's many stories about that, which is why I am not surprise by it. Oh and by the way, this anime also has romance. Not much, but an amount to say that aftera couple of months that you watched this anime, you'll forget it and only remember the basic concept of this show. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, back to the story, \\n\r\nOhana will move to her grandmother's inn because of her Mother disappearance, and so she then meets the other female characters that helps progress the story of Ohana's interaction with them. Fine and all, but doesn't poke my interest that much.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is pretty, I like it and it's neat to look at. I'm certain it was one of the good points of this show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nIt wasn't bad, but not my taste of music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nWas it just me, but I don't get how the characters in show were a bit tense and occasionally stiff, I don't know dude, but I couldn't enjoy the interaction the Main girl lead had with the other characters, it was..weird. \\n\\n\r\nBut after 13 episodes or so- you get to finally see more emotion which was definitely better for this show. I enjoyed it a lot more afterwards, it improved my thoughts towards them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nYeah it was fun to watch, but not something that would make you be at the edge of a cliff, because you know it is a slice of life for a reason. So I recommend watching a few episodes each day so that you won't get completely bored and then avoid watching this it for a couple of days, cuz you'll forget about this anime, Or so I say.. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nYeah it's not surprising for me to rate it a 7, I mean the last few episodes were good and it's not like this anime is trash, It just wasn't the right moment for me to watch or re-watch it. Ironic huh.. Welp that's all I can say without spoiling anything \"important\" and I hope you come to like this anime, unlike me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've become a pretty big PA Works fanboy after Shirobako, and I've been looking for something to scratch that itch since then.  I tried NagiAsu and wasn't a big fan, but I figured Hanasaku Iroha seemed fun and might be able to fill the void left by Aoi and the gang!  So let me take you on a journey of self-growth and inspiration.\r\nStory (9/10) - Much like Shirobako, Hanasaku Iroha has a premise that sounds rather boring, for lack of a better term.  It's about a girl, displaced by her own mother, that goes to live out in the countryside at herGrandmother's Inn.  That's it, that's the whole thing.  Yet as uninspired as that may sound, Iroha has been anything but.  The story isn't flashy, but it is very grounded in human emotion.  We get to see the daily working struggles of working at an in, a very complex lead character that develops and grows throughout the series, the importance of family, and the indomitable perseverance of the human spirit.  From such a basic story, you really get to feel the ups and downs of life itself, and the reward of continue effort in face of a challenge.  It's simple setup is almost part of the genius, allowing you to focus on the characters themselves and their relatable struggles that we all face ourselves.  Trying to find your place in life and even finding acceptance from your parents and role models are additional themes that pop up in this show just crammed full of meaning, yet despite a few occasional stumbles, the show manages to drive home most of its messages with surprising deftness.  It can be a bit heavy-handed at times, but it fits the tone of the show and its optimism in the face of despair.  It really makes you feel good.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10) - The art and animation in this show was great.  The character models and animation weren't necessarily immaculate, but it was consistently decent quality without any hiccups or noticeable drops.  The animation was usually fluid and at times quite appealing when simply watching someone cooking or trying to carry trays, making mundane actions seem interesting all on their own.  The background artwork was stunning, as it usually is with PA Works, and an absolute treat for the eyes!  As well as the backgrounds, I also always appreciate PA Works attention to detail with animation, including the additional work they put into the body language of characters during interactions and even background actions to keep a scene fresh, interesting, and natural.  Nothing ever feels uncanny or robotic, and it really lets you focus on the action and dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) - The sound for this show was definitely rock solid, but I can't say that it stood out to me either.  It competently handled emotional scenes and subtly encouraged you to be joyous when needed, and the OP/EDs were pleasant, but I can't say any of the music was noteworthy.  It was certainly mixed well and the VA work was fantastic, especially Ohana.  There was more Foley than I would expect out of this type of show as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10) - The characters in Iroha are absolutely splendid.  Ohana just feels like such a genuine and optimistic person, even in the face of all the hardship she has been through, you can't help but love her and root for her!  Both the grandmother and mother start out as adversarial figures that you really don't see in a positive light, but without spoiling too much, you really get to understand them just a little bit better as the story progresses.  It may not entirely redeem them in your eyes, but surely they gain your respect when you never thought they could initially.  The rest of the supporting cast is absolutely fantastic as well, with most of the main supports having their own stories of growth as well.  They really did a great job with all the monologues of these characters and the dialogue between them all; all of them feel natural and very human, you can't help but by endeared by them.  They may even remind you of yourself a little bit!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) - While I will admit my enjoyment waned slightly in the 3rd quarter of the show, for the vast majority I was enjoying myself more than enough to warrant a 10 here.  Having worked at a hotel/restaurant myself, the story was very relatable to me, and I really felt for all the characters.  The show really many to affect me on many emotional levels which is a testament to its writing and characters.  Ohana is definitely one of my favourite MCs and I love her enthusiasm.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score (10/10): Definitely one of my all time favourite shows I've watched, right up there with Shirobako.  Spiritually, Iroha is actually quite similar to Shirobako in a lot of ways, and if you enjoyed Shirobako, you will certainly find something to enjoy about Iroha.  It's a bit of a roller-coaster of emotions, but overall it is very uplifting and heartwarming.  I thoroughly enjoyed all the themes explored in Iroha, especially with regards to family, and I most certainly will have to watch this show again in the future and get my hands on a copy of the blurays.\\n\\n\r\nThanks PA Works for another amazing experience!",

            "content": "-- [ Hanasaku Iroha - 26 Eps - 8 / 10 ] --\r\nOne-liner: Good slice-of-life / drama series. Ok plot with a certain feeling of incoherence. Excellent animation. Will literally leave you wanting for more at the end. Characters can be annoying.\r\n(Updated to fix a few spelling mistakes and make things clearer)\r\n-- [ Story: 7 / 10 ] --\r\nHanasaku Iroha, which I'll abbreviate to just Hanasaku, is about the main female character, Ohana, being forced to go to live at her grandmother's inn because her mother ran away with her boyfriend who had debts. Uh... ok. The problem is that the grandma is very strictand says Ohana has to earn her living by working as a waitress at the inn. Rest assured, there is nothing ecchi in that.\\n\\n\r\nJust a basic slice-of-life plot. The story in itself is not very interesting and quite slow going at times. A few of the episodes are fairly useless and do not contribute to the underlying plot which involves Ohana's evolution towards a person that relies only on herself to someone who learns how to trust others. There is also the issue of Ohana's romance being unresolved with Koichi.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting part of the story is the comedy parts which are well executed and provide quite good laughs. Ohana always does unpredictable and weird things, which often chains with the supporting characters doing other weird things.\\n\\n\r\nI also liked the slow pacing of the story. It has its good points: it's an anime you can watch and feel relaxed afterwards. Although, I'll admit sometimes the story feels a bit slow and it's as if the characters are taking too long to resolve their issues, but I guess that's subjective.\\n\\n\r\nTwo things I didn't like were a certain lack of coherence between the various arcs in the anime. It's as if the anime is centered around groups of episodes and the result at the end of the group does not matter in subsequent groups. There is also a particularly dramatic event that occurs towards the end of the series and I felt as if the characters did not react enough to it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, overall, an average plot but good comedy.\\n\\n\r\n-- [ Art: 9 / 10 ] --\\n\\n\r\nSome anime today have really good animation, highly detailed and fluid movements coupled with very detailed backgrounds, all rendered in eye-pleasing colors. Hanasaku is one of those anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, attention to detail, fluidity of movements are just great. The same can be said about camera angles, especially when panning backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nI particularly liked the scenery shots, where you can see the inn from a distance, often with the sun behind. Those scenes are awesome in terms of lights and colors. I liked the traditional look of the inn and the waitresses' uniforms, portrayed in great detail.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves were very varied and quite distinct from those in other anime. Good designs, overall. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like art, you will like Hanasaku Iroha.\\n\\n\r\n-- [ Sound: 8 / 10 ] --\\n\\n\r\nAs usual, am not one that usually pays attention to sound in anime.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I found the music used in Hanasaku to be well-chosen, a good blend of dramatic, fast-pacing and slow/relaxing music. I preferred the second opening to the first, but that's just down to musical tastes.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was ok, no complaints there, although one or two of the characters' voices kind of annoyed me. Am looking at you, Takako. It does get better at the end though, with less stress on the voice etc.\\n\\n\r\n-- [ Character: 7 / 10 ]--\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was acceptable, but not excellent. While the characters themselves were fairly likable, the lack of character development prevents me from giving a higher score.\\n\\n\r\nBackground stories are not explored as such. Granted, this is a slice-of-life anime, but still, I'd have appreciated a bit more of background on the characters. Even the main character does not get enough history. Like, there are hardly any mentions of Ohana's early childhood or her dad.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing said about the secondary female characters, such as Minko. Even the stern grandmother, Sui, has no story except that she has an inn.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the characters and their interactions themselves in the present were quite nicely done. Ohana often does unpredictable and funny stuff, which causes chain reactions in the other characters' behaviors.\\n\\n\r\nI do have to point out that at some times, some characters become borderline annoying, especially the grandmother with her \"the customer always comes first\" attitude, Takako's abuse of English phrases and Minko's \"Ohana wants to steal my crush\" frenzies, and turns out to be a rather unlikable tsundere. Overall, ok characters but nothing great other than the main character, who I particularly liked.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, a few of the supporting characters are more fun than the main ones. Ohana's mother is always a delight when she's on screen.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good point is character evolution. For example, the main character Ohana is very different at the end of the series than at the beginning, showing more maturity and ready to face her issues. This evolution is apparent over the series and seeing this was an enjoyable trip. Ohana starts from a girl that is undecided about her life, not knowing what she wants to do, to someone more assertive, ready to take decisions. From trusting no one, relying only on herself, she accepts strangers (who then become friends) as family who can be relied on.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters also experience evolution, in varying degrees. Nako goes from a shy, introverted girl to one more outgoing. Minko... uh, accepts her feelings... in some way? The grandmother becomes less stern and strict and more motherly.\\n\\n\r\n-- [ Enjoyment - 8 / 10 ] --\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked was the comedy in the series and Ohana's unpredictability. I also liked character interactions and how situations get resolved in somewhat strange ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, while not brilliant, was acceptable and enjoyable to me. At the end, I was especially looking forward to the ending to see how the series will end.\\n\\n\r\nI also appreciated the discreet fan-service. The characters were pleasing to look at and the series did a good job at allowing you to do precisely that, while maintaining decency and leaving a lot to your imagination. There is no nudity as such, except a few \"glancing\" shots with convenient censoring, all done very tastefully.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance was also well done. It's not just \"should I confess?\" but more, \"if I confess, what happens? Do I want that? Or do I like the status quo?\" and questions like that. The anime assumes its viewers are intelligent in resolving a few plot details on their own. Nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nI will admit that I was kind of let down by the ending, with a feeling of wanting for more. There is supposed to be either a season 2 or an OVA or \"something\" as announced by the committee responsible for development. I'll look forward to that.\\n\\n\r\n-- [ Conclusion - 8 / 10 ] --\\n\\n\r\nI give Hanasaku Iroha a 8 because it was just fun for me. I was always looking forward for more episodes to watch because I was always curious about how the story would evolve. There is no plot as such but it was still fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves, how they changed over the series etc also kept my attention so that's a plus.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I didn't like were a few of the scenes were the characters grew annoying, a few plot lines taking too long to resolve and the feeling of wanting for more from the ending.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the last point, if ever there is another season or OVA or something, Hanasaku Iroha should really earn 8.5 / 10 then. But if there is no such sequel, it'd be a bit disappointing as the series certainly shows promise and would deserve a sequel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, an enjoyable anime if you like good art, likable characters, good comedy and nice pacing. Not so much if you're expecting an awesome plot that will keep you on edge. But then, it's a slice-of-life and drama series! What kind of plot do you expect?",

Slice of life is new too me but i thought this was a very good anime. It kept me compelled after the first episode, and i ended up watching all 24 within two days. The characters were great and memorable, and I felt as if i was taking part in a very touching story. If you need an anime to help uplift  your spirts, this is one of them. I felt enormously happy after i finished this series. Most animehave me feeling as if it was a bad ending and all that, but this one does not. It finishes well and strong and solves all the problems that the characters had at the start of the series. All in all i give it a 10 and also i forgot too add that the artwork is VERY NICE, that took a big role in making this anime lifelike.",

            "content": "I don't really get the rating system when it comes to reviews. \r\nI generally don't even notice the music, and as long as either the characters or the story are amazing, I can't be bothered to rate it with anything other than my enjoyment level.\r\nHence, why most of my ratings are either 9 or 10. Not super creative, eh? This is also my first review, so if it isn't helpful or it's really confusing... \r\n...Oh wait. I don't actually care. Sorry. \r\nRead my ramblings if you want; I'm just trying to fill the void of having watched a series that was really great, and havingnothing to watch now it's finished.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to teenage-romance in anime, it's usually something along the lines of:\\n\r\n 'Oh I (female main) am so in love with you (male protagonist), but you're (already in love/don't love me/don't know I love you), so I'm just going to keep one-sidedly in love with you while experiencing totally unoriginal life events!' I'm sure you've seen more than your fair share, with the few exceptional surprises.\\n\r\nIn my opinion, this is one of those exceptions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n*(SPOILER ALERT!!! I think. Probably. Skip the next paragraph if that bothers you)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nA confession in the first episode, from a non-MC to the FEMALE MC starts this story off right. They could easily have used a one-sided love on Ohana's part to add some spice to her leaving Tokyo to live with her Grandmother. They didn't, and I can't begin to tell you how nice that was. \\n\r\nThere are also a few other romances, as is to be expected, and the usual drama that these things bring, but overall I like the way they handled the relations between the concerned parties. And wow, it's really hard to write a review without spoiling anything, isn't it? Yay, failure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nConsidering I started this anime under the assumption that there would be no romance or male MCs AT ALL (hello, misleading poster), I was pleasantly surprised and happy with the way they pulled things off.\\n\\n\r\nOn another note, I loved the Bonbori festival, an event mentioned pretty much throughout the entire series, and is pretty relevant to the plot... I think. In any case, the whole concept (if not a real festival) was wonderfully done: paper lanterns to light the path to Izumo, so the child-god doesn't lose her way; the attached prayers answered in lieu of thanks. Suteki.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't give the plot a ten because, well, the plot isn't very original, and not much actually happens that isn't written in the summary. But it's still a fun, peaceful slice-of-life about life in the country side, and the joys and the trials of working in a ryokan. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nAh, the art. I love the art. Gorgeous. \\n\r\nI'm very picky about art; so much to the point that I can't watch most anime pre-2008 or so because the art quality and style drop so suddenly. \\n\r\nThis art, though. \\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are gorgeous, the lighting superb; the characters are well drawn, without all of that pink/blue/green hair non-sense anime creators are so fond of. It adds a sense of realism that fits perfectly with the slice-of-life theme.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7.5\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, the good:\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I gave this show a relatively high rating despite it's rather unoriginal plot, was the character's reactions to events, and choices of action based on those events. \\n\\n\r\nDespite her mother running off with her useless boyfriend, despite having to move, change schools and go live off in the middle of nowhere with a Grandmother she's never met, Ohana's reaction to the situation was to treat it as an adventure and an opportunity. \\n\\n\r\nMost characters would be unhappy, ill-tempered and angry over this, but Ohana's reaction being the complete opposite was both surprising and pleasing. And a bit disappointing, because I personally enjoy the female mains being emotional wrecks, but well. It was a surprise, and not a particularly bad one. \\n\r\nThis sort of attitude continues throughout the anime, and is altogether not unpleasant. Especially since I usually hate the female mains. \\n\\n\r\nOhana's Grandmother was also a pleasant surprise. Harsh, unflinching, the epitome of stern Obaa-sama. As the story continues we find out that this isn't truly the case, but in the beginning it's the perfect counter to Ohana's sometimes over-the-top, nosy personality. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, the Bad Ones:\\n\\n\r\nLike most anime with 20 episodes or more, a few characters are given special attention. This is generally enjoyable and interesting, because who doesn't want to know more about their favourite characters?\\n\\n\r\nThis, I think, is where they could have tried a little harder.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus on Nako (in my opinion, one of the more annoying characters) was quite frankly frustrating. She gets more focus than her boring, 'I'm so bad at talking to people, I'm so shy, omigooooood I want to chaaaange' character deserves. She's not horrible, but she didn't deserve almost three episodes focused singularly on her. \\n\r\nI wish they'd gone further into the lives of the male characters (Tohru and Ko), whom I found interesting and definitely wanted to know more about. \\n\\n\r\nMinko is also an aggravating character, although I suppose that can't be helped: she's tsundere to the point where I'm not even sure there's' dere' any more. The way no one really gets upset with her thoughtless, even cruel way of speaking and putting people down gets annoying fast. There isn't much shown about her other than her crush and that she wants to become a chef. The lack of character depth just makes everything worse. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of the other characters have interesting personalities, but because no details are given about their past, or much effort put into giving them depth, they kind of fall flat and fade into the background. A shame, as a lot of them had serious potential.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, with a whole 26 episodes to work with, they could have gone much deeper into the characters' back-stories and personalities.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nGood, I suppose? I didn't notice it being bad, so I suppose that means it's good. If anyone actually cares about that sort of thing.\\n\r\nBut it was sort of pretty I guess, so a 9 it is!\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nI don't watch anime I don't think I'm going to enjoy. I judge books by their cover, and I'm totally not ashamed. Which is why I came so close to not watching this. \\n\r\nThank God for Bored days. \\n\\n\r\nI have my personal issues with the plot and the characters, but in the end I believe that the characters all balance each other out, and fit well in a setting that - while not wholly original - is both picturesque and engrossing. \\n\\n\r\nSo I hope one day you have a boring day too, and-\\n\\n\\n\r\n...Omg headache, this typing shit is annoying, God reviews are stupid, just go watch the damn show. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hanasaku Iroha is a very impacting and high quality slice of life anime with a touch of romance that you don't see very often. The story starts of fairly simple and won't get that much more complicated as the anime progresses. However what many people don't realise is, is that very complex stories aren't automatically good and neither are simple ones bad. This is the case with Hanasaku Iroha, a very relatable and simple story with near perfect execution.\r\nThe difference between this anime and other similar slice of life animes is the depth of every  single character. What really caught me by surprise washow much I actually empathized with the characters. Whenever I see a conflict rising up between the characters it feels like as if I'm the one who's caught up in it. Hanasaku iroha has really done a great job at bringing out the characters and managed to make them and all of the watchers feel more alive. \\n\\n\r\nI have to say that this is one the most enjoyable animes I've watched in quite a while. The precise art, the catchy opening song, and the realistic story all complement the quality of this show. Watching this anime makes you think about life and all the decisions you have to make in the future.\\n\\n\r\nI suggest you give this anime priority over other ones and watch it asap if you haven't already.",

            "content": "At times, what makes something fresh and different may only be a simple setting change. While rightly considered a high school drama, Hanasaku Iroha places particular emphasis on life subjects not usually touched upon in high school dramas; subjects beyond just love octagons. The series takes a hands-on approach in exploring the very human lives of the characters who work at Kissuiso Inn, utilising their various character developments and plots to present the audience a collection of life lessons that ranges from parenthood to a simple lesson of teamwork. The always dynamic atmosphere of Kissuiso makes the setting feel like a real place and thecharacters feel like real, breathing human beings; a big credit is due to the concept artists as well, which I will go into later.\\n\\n\r\nLike most Slice of Life genre contenders, the characters make the entire show. Whilst Hanasaku Iroha does offer a solid series of story plots, the colourful cast of characters are what makes this show engaging from start to finish. The top of the ladder presents an already unconventional character dynamic of three family generations: starting from Sui, the 70 year old owner of Kissuiso, her daughter, 38 year old journalist Satsuki, who's also the mother of 16 year old Ohana, our main lead character. There exists a particular flavour of familiarity that these three family members share in terms of life experiences, which makes it all the more interesting to watch how the 'like mother, like daughter' characteristics materialise through different lives and time periods. Of course, there's also Satsuki's younger brother (Ohana's uncle), but his role in this family dynamic only plays a big role towards the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\n'Festing it up'; a saying that sprouted from Ohana's abnormally powerful vocal chords during a time of desperation, essentially forms the basis of these three characters' stories within the series and the overall theme that Hanasaku Iroha offers. What makes this saying frustrating, is the general lack of definition: it is a seemingly empty saying with no literal meaning behind it. However, as a catalyst for further analysis, Ohana's family members (including herself) all share a tiger's determination to succeed in their lives and to achieve their own goals ruthlessly. This common personality of their respective characters each meant resulting consequences in the form of a dysfunctional family, where the parents ignored the needs of their children for the pursuit of their own dreams, which of course acts as the overarching story of the show. So essentially, As a defence mechanism, after being raised in an environment where no one could be trusted other than herself, Ohana's independent and fiery nature is put to the test as she started working at her grandmother's inn.\\n\\n\r\nOhana's character is one of mean-spirited determination, one that can be both considered as admirable and at times self-harming. As a teenage girl, Ohana was forced to grow up earlier than she was meant to and had no father to speak of and a mother that is irresponsible at best, downright obnoxious and selfish at worst. It is thus rather interesting, to find Ohana a person who is direct in her confrontations, physical and practical in her intentions and is overall a very pleasant and strong character in her own right: what she learns in this series is a sore need of friends and a hard lesson on the consideration for others.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be unfair of course, to leave Satsuki and Sui in the dust: both these characters are portrayed in a negative light towards the starting of the series. But with the show's steady plot progression, both characters were given satisfying growth spurts and enough explorations to become decent characters, who complements Ohana's strong presence in the show really nicely. Side characters, largely those who reside in Kissuiso, are all given pleasant amounts of screen time, personality quirks and a general likeability in all of them; ranging from a tsundere Minko (who, to this reviewer's opinion, comes closest to being unlikeable on some occasions) to an age-conscious head waitress Tomoe, who exists as an alternative mother figure to the girls who work under her and also acts as the resident badass at survival gaming.\\n\\n\r\nIn the visual department, Hanasaku Iroha is nothing short of stunning, although it shouldn't be taken as a surprise, considering the involvement of production studio, PA Works; whose works spans from action thriller CANNAN, KEY urban fantasies Angel Beats and Charlotte to the underwater visual extravaganza that is Nagi no Asakura; have proven themselves to be a studio capable of consistent and high production values. The show's attention to background art detail is evident in the presence of Kissuiso's interior and exterior; a lived in but welcoming inn with its easily distinguishable personalities and stylings when compared to other featured inns in the series. The landscape background art, from the rural greenery around the inn to the urban high rise buildings of Tokyo are also given nice contrast in colours and vibrant lighting; not to mention the effortless beauty that the show maintains during night scenes, both rural and urban. \\n\\n\r\nIn the animation department, much are available for applause as well: character movements maintains their fluidness and weight, with solid attention given to body expressions and interactions with the background objects and environment. There are moments where the use of CGI can get a sharp decrease in quality and become jarring (note Episode 3, CG panning shot of Kissuiso Interior and Episode 7; a charging scene featuring survival gamers), but those moments are far and between.\\n\\n\r\nIn the sound department, with no English dub to judge, and an inability to go into detail regarding my thoughts on the Japanese actors' performance (the best I could say, is that they were solid and fit their respective characters well), I will move straight on to the music. \\n\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha seems to have an habit of not only presenting us with an abundance of OP's and ED's sequences, but also shower us with extra song numbers as well to accompany them. Thankfully, there do exist 2 frequently used OP and ED sequences and songs, respectively, that allows the series to maintain a solid identity within them. The first OP features a solidly performed song by nano.RIPE; sang with appropriate energy and enthusiasm, accompanied by a high quality OP sequence which featured the busy lives of the workers at Kissuiso. The second OP sequence maintains the quality, accompanied by another song performed by nano.RIPE; subjectively inferior to the first in this reviewer's opinion. Both ED's are solid in their simplicity: rotating frames of either light beams or maple leaves with our main characters filling in the gap, accompanied by more mellow song numbers.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music and instrumental soundtrack was composed by veteran Shiro Hamaguchi, who managed to invent a score that had hidden complexities that were (and still are) rare in Slice of Life TV. With a simple ensemble of a small strings section and solo violin and cello, woodwind section, flute and clarinet solos, acoustic guitar and piano, the soundscape sounds wonderfully organic, relaxing and emotionally enriching. The tones produced by the score range from happy-go lucky to melancholy. Due to the intimate nature of the tracks, the series is prone to be wrongly accused of being 'too light' on music. But to trained ears, the restraint is appropriate to the show and the musical development of prevalent themes through multiple instrumentations and flavours presents a smartly presented score. However, at its best, the score does manage to evoke a majestic sense of religiosity, heavily featured towards the end of the series, with a track that was led by a sizeable vocal choir, which also appropriately accompanies the Bonbori Festival. Check out the track 'Ray of Light'. Don't forget to turn up the volume, make yourself comfortable and close your eyes. http://anime.thehylia.com/soundtracks/album/hanasaku-iroha-original-soundtrack/24%2520-%2520Ray%2520of%2520Light.mp3\\n\\n\r\n(Side note) Interestingly, both OP sequences heavily feature trains, train lines\u2026and butterflies. This is also evident in the show itself; trains are everywhere, even more so than shows of similar subjects with Hanasaku Iroha. Considering the themes of life journeys and chasing dreams, there exists parallels with the visual depiction of trains, train lines and embarking on a journey; an experience in which looking outside the window to enjoy the ever-changing landscape is eternally more interesting than lusting for the arrival: didn't they say that it's always about the journey, not the destination? (Sorry about the sudden symbolism talk).\\n\\n\r\nTo 'professionally' conclude, there are some great lessons to be learnt and a wonderful slew of events to be witnessed in Hanasaku Iroha, where the daily trials and tribulations of an inn managed to slip in stories regarding rebelling teenagers, life-long dreams, the dread and reflections of old age and unrequited love. The Slice of Life genre will find a worthy advocate in this series as one that's engaging, meaningful and above all else, entertaining. \\n",

            "content": "Hanasaku Iroha is adorable! I think that's probably the best word to describe it.\r\nThis series went down like tea with a bit of honey. It's refreshing to see slice of life done like this.  It starts with Ohana, the main character. You can't help but root for her. She comes across as energetic yet earnest. We follow Ohana from her start at Kissuiso and watch as she matures and grows while at the hot spring. From there, the series explores a wide variety of characters. While I had my doubts at first, the cast at Kissuiso was very well rounded and interesting. Hanasaku Irohadid a good job of keeping focused on the main character in a sea of supporting characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs opposed to my usual preference for drama and psychological/dark events, there's not a lot of drama in Hanasaku Iroha and the story telling largely remains positive and happy. But I was never bored and always looked forward to the next episode. With a very light sprinkle of romance (and I mean light, but the ending  is well done in this regard) Hanasaku Iroha is probably the best \"slice of life\" I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't need non-stop fighting action or secret plots and enjoy slice of life then Hanasaku Iroha is for you. I passed on this at first because I read it didn't have a lot of romance, and while this is true I do believe it's probably still worth your time if you're a fan of Rom-Coms/slice of life type shows.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. very well done in regards to this taking place in a hot spring inn. I never felt like there was unnecessary fan servicey-type shots. Well done and tasteful.",

The first few episodes..well\u2026not much happen really..just the mc doing some things to make herself better at her job\u2026hmmm..where do I saw this before\u2026it seems nostalgic\u2026anyway\u2026despite the plain introduction, the story does get better towards the ending.. The story is...pretty good actually.. I kind of like the main storyline.. it\u2019s not really like thetypical slice of life anime story since it has that seinen tag\u2026the story is quite different in a good way.. but.. let\u2019s not forget the flaw\u2026I believe this anime can get better if there are just a little fanservice\u2026by the way the fanservices from a scale of 1 to 5 (the bigger the number the more fanservice it has).. I would rate it 3/5.. The fanservices are unnecessary.. I might be a little biased here because I\u2019m not really the type who like fanservice but I believe it\u2019s unnecessary.. it\u2019s not like there are an awful lot of fanservice in this anime but, I think\u2026 for this kind of anime.. It\u2019s a little bit too much.. other than that\u2026there are some scenes that are unnecessary too\u2026but don\u2019t let this discourage you to watch this anime\u2026the best is yet to come\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation/Graphics/Art/Etc- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty average for a slice of life anime\u2026nothing impressive and it\u2019s not bad\u2026however I believe this anime strong point is the art itself\u2026.it beautifully described the life in this anime\u2026in other words\u2026it suits the anime incredibly well\u2026I love this anime art.. They did a great job in this department \\n\\n\r\nThe Music- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music are.. not really that memorable\u2026I only like the 2nd op.. other than that it\u2019s just\u2026meh\u2026 well, maybe it\u2019s just not my type of music.. but the sound effect is pretty good.. I have no complaints about the sound effect\u2026but they are quite forgettable\u2026but they still sounded good to me\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are dynamic.. it felt like they are kind of alive.. There are happy go lucky character who lived in a harsh life before..a character who share the same personality like me(that\u2019s a plus\u2026to me at least..)a character that is an erotic novel writer.. and many more characters that are not annoying ..we can see how characters with different personality manage to somehow befriend one another\u2026there are at least 5 characters that we can see their reason why they are there or what inspired them to be there.. we can see some sort of depth in some of the characters... they are entertaining to watch as long as you don\u2019t get annoyed to them\u2026 for me they are likeable and I find their actions are understandable..\\n\\n\r\nMy Personal Enjoyment- 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t let my personal enjoyment let you down.. This will not affect the final score.. but still.. if you like an anime with a good storyline..like I do\u2026 you will or might be disappointed.. it\u2019s one of those good anime that I didn\u2019t enjoy.. this case is also similar to my experience with Code Geass..\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score- 8.13/10",

Probably one of the best  slice of life anime i have ever seen, with Drama that continues to stir up the story and making it more enjoyable overall.\r\nThe Story is nice heart warming story line with several tear jerking moments, it starts off with ohana chan moving to the country side due to family problems. How new life at the country side provides comedy and romance drama for viewers, it projects how difficult life really is.\r\nThe art itself is very beautiful with amazing background in certain episodes, each character is fairy detailed rather then the typical simply anime sketches.\\n\\n\r\nEach Character is very unique and different from each other, which causes conflict between them for example the cheerful ohana agaist the Moody Tsundere type character Minko. The story focuses on the drama that arises from each character, and creates a nice story for each character quite often with drama focused on romance or hardship. although i'm not gonna lie, some parts really did piss me off due to Ohana cheerful and outgoing attitude she did things which you wouldn't do if you had common sense, and minko was that character that pissed you  off because she was just to damn selfish. Nako was a great character providing comedy when needed and supporting each of the other characters. The adult side characters were basically there to provide comedy, except for Ohana's relatives which was actually part of the main drama story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i enjoyed this anime very much, it provided everything that a slice of life genre fan needed. WIth everything from Comedy, Tear jerking scenes/drama, actually showing everyday life Unlike many other slice of life that focuses on comedy, this anime actually focuses more on reality and shows how hard life actually is! This is definitely a must watch!",

I could see her persistence and stubborness but no passion, because she started something that wasn't her dream but she made into that on the way because life brought it like this.\r\n  Somewhere in the middle, the series losts it's path, and personally, I couldn't understand for whichreason there were 26 episodes, while the plot could be developed in just 12.\\n\r\nNot because it wasn't good - on the contrary. Because the characters were so well made, that is was clear what they wanted and what development their personalities could have during the plot unraveling. \\n\\n\r\n  I believe that some of the events that happened, were extra, because everyone had the resolve and didn't need an excuse to act the way they did.\\n\\n\r\n  The only development that moved me - which was expected from the first episode and that was what I was waiting for- was the relationship between daughter - mother- grandmother. It was really sweet and made my heart melt <3  \\n\\n\r\n   I had a hard time finishing the anime because there was no clear path it was walking on, and got me bored. It started great but got mediocre till the end.",

            "content": "When it comes to anime that's focused on hotspring setting, you usually get a lot of fanservice but Hanasaku Iroha is not one of those anime. This series is one of most captivating and relaxing slice of life series I've watched. \r\n[Story] \r\nThe number one criticism that I heard the most in this series is how the staff didn't stick with the plot that the first two episodes showed us and instead showed us a bunch of random slice of life \"filler\" moments until the last few episodes where they \"finally got back on track\". I put those quotes there because I did not saythose words. I mean, while I agree with them, I just have to say that this is, in fact, a slice of life series after all. When I decided to pick this series up, I was expecting those random slice of life moments and since I've watched a lot of Slice of Life before (and I'm a fan of the genre too), I didn't have any problems with it. \\n\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha is more of a character driven series rather than a plot-driven series. The first two episode may have seem look like it was going to have a plot, albeit a romantic plot but it's more focused on Ohana's character, her character interactions with other people working in the inn and how she's living her life in a hotspring inn called \"Kissuiso\" after her mother decided to run away. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the hotspring setting might have caught your attention because if you think of hotspring in anime, it's usually filled with fanservice but I can assure that this anime is NOT filled with obnoxious fanservice. There was only a couple of fanservice scenes that I could think off and that was in Ep. 3 (Onoha getting strapped on by a red rope which made it look like she was a sex slave and that Onoha x Minko \"yuri\" scene). Other than episode 3's fanservice, the fanservice is pretty much non-existent. I mean, the series has 26 episodes so I'm pretty sure you can handle one episode with fanservice scenes. That means 25 episodes without unnecessary fanservice scenes.   \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (10/10)\\n\r\nI believe P.A Works is currently the only anime studio right now that can produce a crisp and beautiful animation in a 2 cour run. Not even ufotable can produce a 2 cour series without their animation becoming inconsistent once they are on their 2nd cour. Just like other P.A Works' shows, Hanasaku Iroha's visual looks beautiful. It's very relaxing to watch and this is making me want to move to Japan just to check out the \"Kissuiso\" hotspring inn. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nA relaxing show with a relaxing atmosphere needs to have a relaxing soundtrack and the show did just that. The soundtrack perfectly fits and whatever the situation is, whether the characters are fooling around or having a serious dramatic moment, it just fits. I don't know what else to say since I can't explain it properly. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme songs are \"Hana no Iro\" by nano.RIPE and \"Omokage Warp\" by nano.RIPE. I thought the 1st OP was really annoying at first because I wasn't used to nano.RIPE's voice at that time. Later on, I grew to love her unique voice and I ended up liking the 1st OP. On the other hand, I love the 2nd OP more. I love the relaxing tune of the song and the melody sounds really nice.  The ED theme songs are \"Hazy\" by Sphere and \"Hanasaku Iroha\" by Clammbon. I really love the 1st ED theme song's relaxing tune, the catchy melody and the singer's voices. The 2nd ED, on the other hand, is a song that I really didn't care about and I wish the 1st ED was kept for like the entire 26 episode run. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha has one of the best and one of the most realistic female lead I have ever seen in my X amount of years watching anime. Since the anime standards corrupted me, I was expecting Ohana, who is a 16 year old teenage girl, to be in one of the dere types but surprisingly...She's not. She really acts mostly like a 16 year old teenage girl and yes, I know how they act. \\n\\n\r\nOhana Matsumae, the female main protagonist of the series, is honestly one of the best female MC I have ever seen and I really wish more female characters in anime acted like her because I'm done seeing the typical violent tsundere girl. Just like every other teenage girls, Ohana fits that image. She's a naive, stubborn but cute and beautiful young girl. At first, she didn't fit in when she moved to Kissuiso but she didn't waver and little by little, she got a grasp of how everything works in the inn. She's a stubborn and arrogant girl because she likes to meddle in other people's business even though it's got nothing to do with her but her determination is what caused her to not give up. She also has that typical teenager \"rebellion\" side. In short, Ohana fits how most 16 year old girls acts like and I like her character because of her personalities that I recently just mentioned. \\n\\n\r\nOhana's character development is also absolutely wonderful. At first, Ohana is an optimistically naive girl. She likes to live in the present and doesn't want to think about her future until it hits her right in her face when that day comes. As her days go by in Kissuiso, she learns what life is and how it's not that simple and linear and her actions there changes her little by little as the series progresses. The show also explored more about her relationship with her mother and why she is what she today. \\n\\n\r\nDon't think that Ohana is the only character to receive that amazing tool called \"character development\". Pretty much everyone in the series has an amazing character development and it will either happen in the 1st or the 2nd half but what I can assure you is every character that you see in Kissuiso (and this also includes Ohana's mother) gets their own time to shine.\\n\\n\r\nThere's this one character that I want to talk about because not only did she annoy me but she will annoy most of the viewers watching this series. That character is Minko Tsurugi. Minko has a cold personality and she lets her emotions run wild and that's is why I found her annoying. She has a jealousy streak (Spoiler reasons if I say the reasons) towards Ohana and I really don't get if she's friends with Ohana or she just likes to hang out with her because she argues with her...like a lot. Despite all of that, I still somewhat like her even though she's annoying. Her character development is the reason why I didn't throw her aside and just plain out ignore her. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nWe really don't get a lot of slice of life anime like this show because 95% of the slice of life genre are \"Cute girls doing cute things\". Hanasaku Iroha was a breath of fresh air and I really enjoyed the series. This is making me wish for a 2nd Season but the movie's good enough and there's really nothing more to expand.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\nHanasaku Iroha is a captivating and relaxing slice of life series that made me want to watch more on the end of its run. The story is pretty nice, even though there's really not much that happened. The characters are enjoyable and it was nice seeing the show giving every single character a spotlight. The visuals are also eye-pleasing and breathtaking and the fact that they managed to keep the animation and visuals consistent throughout its 26 episode run is just amazing. The Art and Animation is on par with one of P.A Works' other anime works like, Nagi no Asukara and even Charlotte. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9.2/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Beautiful and captivating slice-of-life series\\n\r\n+Impressive Art and Visuals and Great and Consistent Animation\\n\r\n+Ohana is one of the best and almost realistic female MC I've seen\\n\r\n+Impressive Character Development for almost every single characters\\n\r\n+Very minimal fanservice\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Minko got really annoying at times\\n",

            "content": "I started watching Hanasaku Iroha immediately after finishing (and loving) Shirobako. I wasn't expecting to love this show on the same level, but I wanted another slice of life type anime. What started off promising turned into such a drag to get through. The first half of the show I enjoyed - I didn't mind the premise and I liked the characters enough to get on board, but around the halfway point the quality of the story plummeted. \r\n[Slight spoilers in this review] I think the problem I had with it was the cast of young characters, who I think I am just too oldto appreciate because of their ridiculous high school problems that I don't relate to/care about in any way. The omurice episode had my rolling my eyes so far into my skull for example. I felt like their characters had potential in the beginning but their development slowed to a snails pace and didn't recover by the end. The adult characters were the ones I liked the most, but they weren't featured in favor of teen drama/slight fan service (we get it...shy girl has huge boobs). \\n\\n\r\nI think the show tried to focus too heavily on making a job in hospitality more romantic and whimsical than it actually is. There is a genuine comradeship that comes with service jobs sure, I've experienced it, but not to the point where it becomes your entire life. All in all, and this is a rushed review, it wasn't for me.",

            "content": "Studio PA Works history prior to doing Hanasaku Iroha was meager to say the least with only one real hit being Angel Beats. However, the director chosen was acclaimed worker within Studio Bones in Masahiro Ando (production in Metropolis, Ghost in the Shell). No doubt, at this time the studio and the staff is extremely talented and wanted to make a mark on the industry. Does a show featuring the blandness of everyday life live up to the challenge?\r\nOur story starts off on an odd note. Ohana, an angsty 16 year old, suddenly gets the news her irresponsible and promiscuous mother is going to elopewith her current lover leaving Ohana to live and work with the grandmother at a traditional Japanese inn out in the country. Quickly, it is sink or swim for Ohana as she must earn her keep at the inn or be kicked out. There she learns various personal trials about life itself.\\n\\n\r\nHere in lies the start of many issues within this anime. Ohana begins angsty and a bit cynical and seemingly overnight (off screen) turns into the optimistic cheerful girl the audience see on screen. The plot never seems to advance with Ohana and each life learning experience, but rather skips as fast as a lightning bolt out of the sky. Basically, she and her personality are all over the place according to what is needed on screen. Somehow, Ohana herself does not come off as a mental sociopath and still remains very much human. Each and every side character is very bland and offers not much more than their defining trait such as her roommate wants to be a cook, her grandmother lives only for the inn, and among others.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes are centered on Ohana as she reacts over emotionally to a situation driving the singular plot of the week. Even when a side character is featured and \u201cchanges\u201d according to how Ohana reacts, the next episode will have the side character reset to their previous bland self as if nothing happened. The concept of conflict seriously lacks within Ohana. Everything and every so-called problem is easily solved by whatever emotion Ohana has at the time. Dare not even get into parental issues this show portrays.\\n\\n\r\nIs Hanasaku Iroha a bad show? No, it is fine at best. Ohana is a character that has flaws, problems, and angst like any other human teenager. However, there is no fallout, or even any repercussions to actions. It is simply a show about an emotional girl that can overcome anything through sheer will of positivity and hard work.",

Hanasaku Iroha attempts to weave together many stories at once - short, more trivial arcs interspersed with plot-specific points.  Some of the arcs were a bit underwhelming.  The arc about Tomoe seemed to hint to some great developments, but ended with one episode, leaving a sense of unfinished business.  Yet, notwithstanding the less important arcs, the overarching plot manages to touch the heartstrings, especially concerning the awkward, bumbling but touching relationship between Ohanaand Ko, the unrequited love of Minko and within Ohana`s family--the family interactions that have built up and threatened to tear apart the hot spring of Kissuiso.   Sadly, some of the characters are not quite as likeable as we would like to think - Minko consistently irritated me and continues to do so -- but it only proves that the characters within Hanasaku Iroha are merely human.  In fact, the way in which the perhaps more-despised characters come to become likeable is quite a plot development.  The last arc of Iroha`s four-month run seems to be wrapping up all the loose ends that have been so artfully woven into the fabric of the piece--and, if the show follows the trend of these last episodes (and the prior arc), Iroha will end a masterpiece.  Hanasaku Iroha has consistently surprised me--mostly positively, occasionally negatively - but one thing is clear, I wouldn`t miss those last 2 episodes for my life.",

I see no problems here.\r\nSound\r\nI don't remember particularly noticing anything about the music but since I didn't notice anything negative I gave sound an 8. \r\nCharacter\r\nI liked the main character especially. The other characters were fine as well it is just that personally I didn't care for them. None of them were obnoxious or annoying which is a great plus as many animes have boring characters. I just don't have anything amazing to say about them.\r\nStory\r\nThe story started out really strong, but after it got midway it started to slow down and it gotkind of boring and then picked up again near the end. I honestly wanted to skip some of the episodes where they were trying to develop the side characters because I couldn't care less. I wanted the story to concentrate more on the main character or at least develop the side characters alongside it rather than setting aside a few boring episodes just to develop them. \\n\\n\r\nProbably my favorite part about his anime was the setting though. After I finished watching it I really wanted to go to a Japanese inn and work there. The scenery was beautiful and it made me wish I was there and not stuck in my home during the cold winter season. The anime did a phenomenal job with the setting and the working environment and I commend it on that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nIf someone is telling you that this anime is a MUST SEE don't listen to them. I don't think I'd find myself recommending this to people unless they like slice of life and are looking for a good one. It was a good show but it wasn't amazing. That said, even though it wasn't amazing I marathoned it within few days without much trouble so that's a good sign. If you want to watch a decent slice of life that isn't filled with garbage watch Hanasaku Iroha.",

Though it's not all about that. It is full of suspense and drama. The story line keeps you wanting to see the next episode. At least for me. Haha. Part of my choice for the scores was the fact that this story made me cry. Whenever anything makes me cry, it's because it touched me. Overall I really enjoyed this anime.

            "content": "The story of Hanasaku Iroha is almost ridiculously simple. A young girl named Ohana, thanks to the irresponsible behavior of her mother, is sent to an inn out in the country to spend her days. This inn is run by Ohana\u2019s grandmother. But she isn\u2019t a cozy grandma who\u2019s going to spoil Ohana. She\u2019s all business, all work, almost cold; and her coworkers are all rather ambivalent about Ohana, too. And although it does feel rather depressing at first, the beauty of this show (and of Ohana) is that, rather than get overwhelmed and feel miserable about her situation, she tries her best to makethis place her own. She tries to take a situation that seems bad, and not so much find the positive, but rather tries to find a way to grow from it. The series is then about her growth as a person, the way in which she learns to find meaning in the work she does, the way in which she learns that she\u2019s not the center of everything happens; it\u2019s one of the finest portraits of a young woman I\u2019ve ever seen in any visual media.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a great line near the end of the series that handily summarizes a lot of what I thought was going on in this series: \u201cwhat you gain from hard work can never betray you.\u201d Time and time again the characters in the series strive to become better at their jobs. Whether it\u2019s Ohana\u2019s struggles to find her own routine and her own place, or Minchi\u2019s struggles to learn the trade of being a chef or, hell, Ohana\u2019s uncle struggle to become good enough to one day become the true successor to the inn \u2013 the characters in this series define themselves by how they do their job. Their job performance seems interconnected with their personal growth, but it\u2019s also connected with their character \u2013 if I\u2019m not working my hardest, what kind of person am I? \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a telling episode about halfway in the show\u2019s run where the main trio of girls visit another inn for a school trip. The inn apparently has a new automated system for taking plates up and down the floors; this saves time and it does away with having full-time waitresses so the inn has some part-timers to do the work. Ohana is at first impressed with the work that everyone\u2019s doing, but then she sees some of the waitresses talking on their phone while still at work, and of course they\u2019re typical \u201chigh school\u201d girls who have an attitude. Later on, these girls walk off the job because they say it\u2019s too hard and you have to remember too many things. These girls, because of their unserious attitude toward their job, are painted as bratty monsters (later on we see them all wearing makeup and making fun of the inn of where they worked at). In Hanasaku Iroha, if you\u2019re not trying to do your best, then that reflects badly on your character. In one of the funniest scenes in the show, Ohana more or less attacks them. Ohana only has patience for people who are trying their best, every character in Hanasaku Iroha is giving it their all.\\n\\n\r\nThis series reminded me of one of the most overlooked movies of the past few years, Margaret. One of the most important lines of dialogue in that film is: \u201cWe are not supporting characters in the fascinating story of your life!\u201d During the first few episodes, Ohana is only concerned about what is happening to her. She sees the situation she\u2019s in as hers alone, and she kinda steps on a few toes around the inn as she struggles to acclimate herself to this new place. She even gets called out as \u201cinconsiderate,\u201d at one point. One of key themes in the show is realizing that everyone around has their reasons (as in Renoir), their own beliefs, their own dreams. The great realization later on in the show where she learns to actually place herself in someone else\u2019s shoes (first with her mom and then later on with her grandma) is so fantastic. She\u2019s such a strong-willed girl that for her to give in and rescind her original feelings is marvelous. \\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t write about this show without also mentioning how much it understands how impermanence of life. The show spans roughly 6 or 7 months. In this period of time, all the characters grow and are shaded with depth and are fully realized. But the reason why the time we\u2019ve spent with these characters is special is because it\u2019s something that\u2019s untenable. People are destined to move away from you, your group of friends won\u2019t always be there in the same exact configuration that you\u2019re used to; things will always end. What Hanasaku Iroha understands most of all is that things are meant to change; it can be a positive change, it can be a negative change, whichever. Late in the show\u2019s run, Ohana\u2019s grandmother makes a decision that disrupts the natural order of what we\u2019ve been watching for the last 20 or so episodes. She forces a change in these characters\u2019 lives. Now, we may want these characters to remain the same way, like in Ranma \u00bd, and never deviate, always acting out the same patterns of behavior, but that betrays a misunderstanding of how life actually works. We\u2019re all working toward our own goals, and sooner or later, we might have to go our separate ways. The places that meant so much to us might become a memory, an important one, sure, but something that was not meant to last. Hanasaku Iroha feels like that. It\u2019s a series that reminds me how much pain and how much laughter are required before you can truly grow.\\n\\n\r\ncopied/pasted from my blog: thenextthingblog.wordpress.com",

It is something that should tell a story, and connect the viewer with each and every character so that they feel and learn from not only the characters but the story as a whole. Hanasaku Iroha encompasses this feeling as though it is not the best show mechanics wise, we can still not only understand the story but can empathize and be shaped by the events and the characters within the story. Thank you, Hanasaku Iroha, for being the epitome of an outstandingshow.",

            "content": "One of my favorite parts of a slice of life drama is the fact that it creates a series of likeable characters that you can invest and see a bit of yourself in, thus making the anime something a lot more than a cartoon. A drama, especially a good one, has the ability to move you and make you feel things, whether those things be happiness or sadness. Hana-Saku Iroha hits every possible nail on the head and is a very effective and moving anime. Iroha is so much fun to watch, so moving at times, contains so many characters that you feel like youbecome friends with, that it transcends the screen and almost feels like a literal vacation to the hot spring resort of Kissuisso.\\n\\n\r\nOhana Matsumae is sixteen years old and lives in Tokyo with her lazy mother. When her mother runs off with a guy, Ohana is sent to the Kissuisso where she believes she is going to be staying with her grandmother, but soon learns she is actually going to be put to work. While resentful at first, she soon grows to love the people of and the Kissuisso itself. She helps all her friends achieve their goals, winds up in a love triangle, and ultimately learns her place in the world.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot isn\u2019t complex, it is deeply tied to the setting and the characters. The characters are what makes the story so very human and sometimes even personal.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fantastic. The characters are distinct in their appearance and the Kissuisso itself is marvelous looking. All of the backdrops of the series are beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is once again, very good. The openings and endings are both fantastic and the music during the show is good too. Characters whistle the theme of the show every once in a while and for some reason, that really appealed to me. The voice actors are really good and convey emotion well. Overall, no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, as they should be for a slice of life drama, are really, really good. Ohana is an all-around likeable girl, from the first time you meet her, to the last time you see her. Her introspections are sprinkled throughout the series and give her a very human feel\u2013she\u2019s just a girl searching for her place in the world. She\u2019s a little awkward, but really fun to be around and seems to give a smile to everyone at work, and even the viewer occasionally. There is a lot of appeal in her character as she really does change throughout the series and watching her grow gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling, especially at the end. She\u2019s one of my favorite female leads in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nNako is your moe character. She\u2019s not as deep or exciting as Ohana, but I guess she\u2019s okay. Out of the three lead girls, she\u2019s the least likeable.\\n\\n\r\nMinko is your tsundere character, and as you can probably tell, I have a thing for tsundere characters (which explains my love for her). I really enjoyed her character because she has a bit of a puppy love thing going on for Tohru, one of the chefs at the Kissuisso, and it\u2019s really cute. But the problem is Tohru likes Ohana. And Minko throws out so many hints but never gets to date him and never has the ability to express herself to him without his blowing it off or not realizing she is actually trying to get with him. She\u2019s a bit of a bitch at times, but she feels Ohana is invading her territory and she has a hard time dealing with the new girl as she has a completely different personality. She does develop a bit through the course of the series, and  becomes a lot more likeable toward the end than she is at the beginning, but I overall enjoyed her.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two really good characters are Tarou, who doesn\u2019t develop at all but is good comedic relief, and Sui Shijima, Madam Manager herself. While at first I really hated her, just as Ohana did, I grew to like her and realize she was a really good person. When her past is revealed, it\u2019s a really touching moment.\\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters range from good (Enishi and Tohru) to annoying (Takako). Some of the side characters, such as Ko, the boy who loves Ohana, have quite a bit of screen time but never really shine through. Ko wasn\u2019t all that exciting and never proved to be anything more than a piece of cardboard. He had feelings, but they weren\u2019t focused on and when he did talk or show feeling it was generic. The same can kind of be said of Tohru. I liked him, but found him to be really dense and sometimes I wished Minko would just slap him or something.\\n\\n\r\nJay Gatsby dreamed of being with Daisy, Lennie and George dreamed of owning a farm, France dreams of waving something other than a white flag, Ohana dreams of being able to live in the world of Kissuisso with her friends forever, and Minko dreams of becoming a chef. This is a series that revolves around the idea of attaining your dreams, no matter what, and it is effectively conveyed through the characters. While the dreams are not as timeless as those of Gatsby or Lennie and George, they are still going to stay with you for quite a while, as are the characters of the series. When the doors of Kissuisso close to you for the last time, it\u2019s certain you will feel a mixture of emotions. Happiness, sadness. You go through all of your favorite memories of the series and realize that Iroha was crazily effective and will stick with you for quite a long time.",

            "content": "Hanasaku Iroha follows the lives of Ohana (the main character) and the people who work at the Kissuiso, an inn that Ohana's Grandmother, Sui or Okamisan as they have to call her, owns. \r\nStory\r\nI gave it an 8.From the start there is tension and drama; and even some comedy. It really is a slice of life show. Ohana, who thinks that it would probably be no worse than where she is at now, is taken to her grandmother's inn to work due to her mother eloping with some guy (how irresponsible!). When she gets there though she gets hit hard with the reality of beingan inn worker. It isn't easy work and you have to be dedicated; something Ohana at first can't really deal with, but as the story progresses she learns to love her job. We thrown different directions in the anime from school festivals, to confessions of love, to people being sent to the hospital; the story really doesn't fall in any category, other than (I think) a slice of life type. For the most part slice of life shows never really turn out that great, but they managed to do a decent job at it with this anime. They keep you interested and that should be good enough to keep you moving to the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nI really really liked the art work, whoever did the designs and architectural features for this anime did an excellent job. I give it a 9, it's that good. The way the shadows look, the way that a wet or just recently polished wood floor looks like is spot on. There's really not much more to ask for. Character designs are excellent. For example when you look at Okamisan's facial features you can tell that she was a beautiful women when she was younger. I give it a solid 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn't really like or hate the openings or endings songs of the anime, and for the most part the background music was forgettable, but that doesn't mean it was terrible. I give it a 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nI like the characters in this show for the most part. Ohana is ditzy, but she speaks her mind and makes things interesting for pretty much everyone including myself. Nako is very reserved and quiet at first, but opens up more as the story progresses. Sui or Okamisan is Ohana's grandmother and inn owner who despite looking like a slave driver, is quite dedicated to her work and expects the workers to be the same way. Minchi is your typical tsundere character, but it isn't extremely obvious like in some of these harem animes you find. For the most part she is very independent and doesn't like to reveal her true emotions that is until gets to her! Tohru is one of the cooks and is just as ditzy as Ohana, but he takes his work seriously and shares that same independent spirit as Minchi. Ren is the other cook who doesn't talk much and has bad taste (haha). There are other characters, but as you can see the characters while not unique are interesting and relate-able. \\n\\n\r\nFor the most, I enjoyed this anime, the story, artwork and characters are very good and keep you interested. While the music is pretty forgettable, it doesn't detract from the essence of the show, which is life is interesting and sometimes difficult, but you have to \"fest it up.\" I give it a low 9 out of 10.",

It very much revolves around the point of view of the main character, Ohana though.  \r\nNot really a romance either eventhough she does have to deal with her love life.

The music in this anime is AMAZING I love the opening song~  \r\nWhile there is attraction in this anime, it focuses more on character development, Which is really good! I fell in love with the main character ohana, she is a well rounded character with likable attributes. I do not recommend this anime for people who want to see love/romance. This is not a shoujo.  \r\nThe bubbly atmosphere of thisanime will make you fall in love.  SO GOOD!!",

            "content": "Watching anime is a past time. It is for entertainment and enjoyment. For me the best judge of a good anime, is having difficulty in not watching the next episode.\r\nThat was just what the anime did to me. Making me stay up to 5 am in the morning, because of this anime is representative of how good it is.\r\nThe story leaves something to be desired. It is a light-hearted drama, not as tear-jerking as others, but I'm sure to leave many people teary-eyed. Simple story, simple premise. It shows what is normally a boring life an exciting turm, and shows a different perspective, which maynot happen in real life, somehow is believable, and really gives an impression that you can relate to the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt is something that is very good. Simple character designs, but really amazing to look at. Something seems of about the design of the main character sometimes, but most of the times, they manage to make them cute. The background images and sceneries are also very beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack of this anime is extremely relaxing and appropriate. This would be on par with the best anime sounds if not for one thing. The extremely unnatural and annoying voice for the opening and closing theme song. Overall, the sounds are appropriate and magnifies emotions that were present for the situations.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters on this anime, seems like people you might meet and know in real life. Everyone has their own moments, and are very likeable and relatable. The only thing is that in real life, the rash actions for Ohana is not having enough consequences in real-life situations. The love stories for this anime is probably happening to many of those watching. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a very enjoyable anime, with funny scenes, sad scenes, something relatable. Depicts the slice of life genre really well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a great watch. Even though I just stumbled upon this anime on accident, and not as famous as let's say clannad or your lie in april, it is still great with loads of light dramas, relatable characters, I recommend this anime to those who like slice of life anime as a must-watch.",

This anime made me feel really happy, and it's one of my go to animes when im feeling down\r\nThe art is great. The characters blush at the right times and the hair is drawn well. My only criticism of the art is the two flowers at the side of the main characters head, however that could relate more to design.\r\nThe sound is also amazing. The opening song has been stuck in my head, andi have the full version on my ipod. The voice actors and actresses do a great job with conveying emotion. I find this a problem in some animes where it has been overdone to an extent where sad scenes are hilarious, however this anime suceeds to make the scenes and sound at an appropriate level.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment is great to. As i said before this anime is a happy anime, and it makes you feel optimistic when you watch it. This is probably due to the main characters attitude, where she looks so brightly on life. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was a great experience. It was really fun to watch and i hope they will continue hanasaku iroha (?) in a way that the sequel will be as equally amusing as this season",

            "content": "Hanasaku Iroha is a series about growing up and finding one's identity. It focuses on a somewhat impulsive and strong willed girl named Ohana Matsumae who, due to family circumstances, is forced to move in with her grandmother, who happens to own a hot spring inn.\r\nThis is a slice of life, but interestingly one that doesn't focus primarily on boy-girl relationships or comical situations on school. This series focuses more on developing relationships with co-workers and learning (the hard way) that reality is sometimes quite harsh. The series does a good job of controlling the viewers emotions and balancing drama with plot progression. As somerecommendations have noted, this is not a series for those that need slapstick comedy, action, or suspense. I will add that it is not for those with short attention spans as certain scenes drone on for quite a while; and important points often take multiple episodes to explicate.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe overall animation has a bit of a washed out look, not as sharp as some other series out there. The majority of the series takes place in the rural countryside so you get an abundance of greenery with satisfactory detail. Character-wise, the styling is fair. No one is overly moe and all the characters are readily distinguishable. I just wish Ohana had a larger wardrobe as she wears probably at most four different sets of clothes throughout the entire series. I also noticed that \"nudity\" was a tag for this series. I do not recall seeing any nudity, just girls in hot springs.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of the lead singer for nano.ripe so I didn't really enjoy any of the OPs. As for the non-nano.ripe EDs, the song Hazy is my pick as the best fit for the series in both tonality and pacing. The BGM is very minimalistic and is composed of mostly calming guitar and piano pieces. Calming enough for me to not recommend watching this late at night (unless you want to fall asleep watching).\\n\\n\r\nKanae Itou leads here as Ohana, and is supported by some other veterans as well as some not-so well knowns. Most notable for me would be Haruka Tomatsu, who easily gives Yuina the cutest personality of the group.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAfter learning that her mother is going to kick her out, Ohana moves to live with her grandmother (who disowned Ohana's mother). To Ohana's surprise, she is forced to work at her grandmother's Inn in order to pay for her room and board. The story is definitely a slow moving one as Ohana slowly warms to the entire workforce at the Inn as well as her off-putting grandmother. However, as Ohana learns her new role as a waitress and grows to like it, she becomes ever more attached to the Inn itself.\\n\\n\r\nThere is decent drama in the series involving love triangles as well as Inn troubles, but all of it serves the central purpose of realizing Ohana's growth. While the story is fair, it's really the character development that shines. And in the end, the conclusion makes you feel that a lot of things are back again at square one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is where you realize why the series is 24 episodes long. Each of the workers at the Inn are unique both in their behavior and colored pasts. A large portion of the series is dedicated to Ohana learning about her new co-workers/friends and growing together to face the challenges of her grandmother and the Inn.\\n\\n\r\nYou get a decent dosage of tsundere, uber-shy, uber-kawaii, and uber-straightforward/determinedness just from the four main girls. Their interactions are for the most part genuine though some of Minchi's actions do seem a bit forced. Overall, watching the girls bond and grow is definitely the standout quality in this series, as in Ano Hana; it's just that in this case it takes a lot longer to explicate.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nFor those who love girl-bonding and/or growing up to face the challenges of reality, this is a sweet, refreshing series that does a lot right. For those who would like a plot-centric story, a thriller, or an ecchi slapstick-comedy this series is a sleeping pill. My personal take is that it did what it needed to do well though it could have done so without 5 or 6 of the episodes.",

That's basically what describes every action of Ohana's as she didn't want to lead a boring life with the same view which comes with the predictable future.\r\nStory; 9 - Ohana Matsumae is a full of energy and spirited girl who finds her current living style plain and predictable which she doesn't want as she desires to be sparkling by leading an exciting life which she believes may begin when she has to move in with her grandmother who runs an inn because her mother ran off with her boyfriend due to his debts as she left Ohana in the traditional hotsprings inn where she has to work to compensate for living there. And now Ohana just might have found her way to sparkle. The story is quite different and refrehing as it feels nice when you watch but I may be a bit biased because I enjoy the Seinen / Slice of life genre together but the story does focus on relationships and bonds with others.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 - The art was beautiful and befitting for this type of anime as the brought out the most from the anime and made this series feel even more amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 - The sound was good as their were moments where I thought that there could be nothing else that'd suit the atmosphere other than what's playing in the backround but at other times I felt it could've done better but overall the soundtrack was satisfactory.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 - The characters were done well and some of them were shown to have developed nicely but again the characters did have more potential to make the anime even better because I think some of the characters weren't used enough or were just left alone rather than developing them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 - I did enjoy this series as it held some elements which I like and this series is suitable for anyone but I think if young people like below 15 watch this series they might not enjoy or more like 'appreciate' this series which is why I recommend that people  over that age watch this series unless you know you understand the value and meaning of series despite your age.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who liked: Chihayafuru,Honey and Clover,Working!!.Servant x Service,Non Non Biyori,Byousoku 5 Centimeter,Gin no Saji,Tamayura,K-On!,Kimi to Boku,Hyouka and Summer Wars will like this series becuase despite there being no obvious relation but these series hold/keep/show similar atmospheres/themes/importance/portrayal as the main or secondary concept.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 - Overall I liked this series a lot but I think it could've done better and developed more but I'm not disappointed as I didn't have much expectations from this one which made me happy as I at the end of the day came to like this series.",

Ohana Matsumae is a realistic character because she shows strength and resolve but can also fall in dispair or get overwelmed byproblems, she's independent and struggles to be so but she admits to need friends and family members to overcome difficulties and also she's a teenager in the prime of her life and she needs to give an answer to someone's love...... and these are the characteristics that gives the protagonist one of the most realistic examples of human nature.... so, if you need a delightful and fresh experience that will make you grow alongside the characters you  definitely came to the right place.",

So just sit back, get some popcorn and watch!\r\nStory:8/10\r\nIt's hard to rate slice of life stories, since they're kind of meant to be weak due to the genre. But it's a sweet story of Ohana, a child with a crappy mother and thrown into a somewhat awkward situation in which she must adapt. Now Ima go into detail and give real advice here, endure through the first several episodes. I almost dropped this show because of it. In the first two episodes, Ohana is going to treated likeutter crap and it's going to piss you off. The third episode is a prime example of unecessary fanservice that was added on to the show, and as much as I can tolerate fanservice, it was so off-putting in this show that it was disgusting with one of the residents being an eroge writer.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:10/10\\n\r\nNo complaints here so it's a 10 in my book!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9/10\\n\r\nEssentially, Hanasaku Iroha is a coming-of-age story, and with it's 26 episode pace, the space is there for characters to develop.

Even the Kissuiso employees and the Madam Manager develop into believable, likeable characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8/10\\n\r\nWhile 26 episodes give adequate pacing and development, the show sticks true to its slice of life genre, so if you are trying to marathon it, Hanasaku Iroha may just bore you through the middle of the show, where you start to feel as if it will go nowhere, but I gurantee the patience will pay off. Everyone moves on and the ending will leave you satisfied as you depart from the lives of the Kissuiso and it's staff. \\n\\n",

Grandmother is cold to her, and so she must learn to work at the inn to earn her keep. It is tough and she is scolded a lot, and not liked by some of the staff, but her buoyant spirit slowly begins to changethe place.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is just so endearing. The main characters are complex and develop over the course of the series. The plot is interesting and very well developed, with lots of fun drama in every episode -- but also stage setting for final dramatic outcomes at the end. The artwork, animation, voice acting, and cinematography were all outstanding as well. Lastly I can say that at the end of the series, I was left feeling bittersweet happiness for the characters, and the only sadness and regret is that it was over. Definitely a 10/10 masterpiece.",

In fact, it is one of the simplest common stories in any type of series. However, it is no doubt very interesting. This is one of the very few series with a simple storyline and plot but still can manage to get the attention of viewers. And even if the storyline is simple, there are no boring episodes. The elements in the story is made well and not overly done. I rather have a very simple series but manage tobalance everything and the result is something really nice and interesting than have a very amazing with exciting plot series but almost everything is over the top. Its simplicity makes the drama not on the heavy side but rather on a heart-warming side. And though it is simple, it is not boring much like the series \u201cWORKING!!\u201d. It can really be funny as well, in a kind of weird way. And because it is about how different people cope up with their situations and works hard despite everything else, it becomes very realistic because it is something we can relate to. It definitely becomes very inspiring because of that. \\n\\n\r\nAs it is not a story with a complicated plot and storyline, the characters are very ordinary and common. Each character is very different from one another and has a role in the story. They are not particularly memorable character but at least they are not irritating so you won\u2019t hate them. Even then, they are still very interesting characters in their own way and some can be consider likeable characters. And just like a typical protagonist, Ohana changes almost everyone around her for the better without her even knowing it. And she herself, changes after arriving and started working in the Inn. She is nice and kind not to the point of being a hypocrite or over the top protagonist. Instead, she is sweet, honest, fun and straight-forward. You can see her growth as the series progresses. These types of characters are always inspiring for any kind of viewers that\u2019s why it is always a sure hit. I also love the Landlady who knows everything and would say the right words at the right time. Usually I am not fond of old people but I really love her very sharp and strict attitude yet still very kind and caring nature. \\n\\n\r\nConsidering it is one of the latest animes of today, it is to be expected that the animations is really great. I am just amaze how detailed the Inn is made. I also notice that the opening themes have lots of running and movements involve which I think really nice and refreshing. The sounds are nice as well. Somehow, it reminds me of the sounds from Honey and Clover series. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, with a huge list of series nowadays, very few series with simple plot and storylines can really be still effective. It is not boring but not too much. In many ways that\u2019s a great thing which make the series amazing. You will be inspired about dreams, ambitions, love, and of course about life.\\n",
