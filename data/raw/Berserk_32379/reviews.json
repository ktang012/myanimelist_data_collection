            "content": "This series just doesn\u2019t get Berserk.  If you were looking for something similar to the 1997 anime,  the movie trilogy or God forbid the manga,  either drop those expectations coming into this or turn around now.   At this point I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m angry,  I just can\u2019t be anymore.   Being frustrated over a show isn\u2019t worth anyone\u2019s time.   If you wanted the short answer that was it, but if you\u2019re willing to keep reading bear with me- It is definitely a bit of a long one.\r\n  Berserk 2016 may very wellbe one of the most disappointing and painful experiences of my life.    I\u2019m not joking.   As a Berserk fan I have never been more ashamed.   I know a lot of people will defend Berserk simply of name alone, but I would be hard pressed to talk about this series in a positive manner just because its Berserk.   After years of people wanting a new Berserk adaptation and so much support for the franchise growing in recent years, you would think this series would be an instant classic.  Anime of the year.  A legend.  So what the hell happened?\\n\\n\r\n  Berserk 2016  fails in literally every category when it comes to production quality.  Animation, music, sound, story---- you name it and it fails miserably.   How something this amateurish and unappealing even  managed to get approved is actually quite mind boggling.    For those who still don\u2019t know by now,  this anime acts as a sort of pseudo-sequel series to each version of the Golden Age arc.   If you\u2019ve watched or read as far as the Golden Age arc into any of the other previous material for Berserk,  that\u2019s all you are expected to know.   If you\u2019ve never experienced the Golden Age arc, STAY AWAY from this series period.  Not only is this the worst possible introduction to Berserk,  but it actually spoils the events of the entire Golden Age arc in its intro ( and in a rather tasteless fashion I might add).\\n\\n\r\n  The story has not only been butchered, but it isn\u2019t even a slightly decent good time on its own.  For those that don\u2019t already know, but want to continue reading anyway the story loosely follows the events occurring after Guts becomes the Black Swordsman and his journey to seeking revenge against the man who left Guts' and his friends for dead.   With everything taken from him, Guts primary focus and center of attention becomes the protection of his now mentally broken girlfriend/ lover Casca.   Guts faces demons, both literally and figuratively. With the rise of a mysterious religious power in Midland on a witch hunt,  he\u2019ll have to track down the girl he left in the care of his remaining friends during his absence.\\n\\n\r\n  I won\u2019t go into too much detail about the actual structure of the series just know that several chapters of the manga have been edited and condensed to where there are several lingering questions and  many plot holes.  It tries to get back on track towards the middle half of the series,  but even if you\u2019ve never read the manga, the absolute rapid pace to which things are presented to you is likely to throw you off.   From the filler episode 3, mentions of a certain bad ass armor, the green behelit, Schierke making an appearance at the beginning and end of the series,  there definitely feels like there were better choices for content removal or editing.  Things that just aren\u2019t relevant to this arc, honestly could have just been removed if they simply just wanted to condense it.  The other adaptions of Berserk always made sure to at the very least keep in the most important aspects,but Berserk 2016 falls apart in the first episode,  combining about 4 to 5 volumes of material.  It seems as though the staff really didn\u2019t pick and choose wisely what should and should not have been included.\\n\\n\r\n  The  \u201cART\u201d  is a putrid blend of 3d and 2d animation,  I would be forgiving on HOW it looks, but how the series is actually animated is terrible.  In Berserk 2016, character movements are stiff and unnatural, color contrast are also absolutely ridiculous, there is often far too many shades of purple or blue where they don\u2019t belong.   With some scenes being either way too dark or way too bright.  ( For example episode 1 and 2 respectively) Either you can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going on most of the time or you\u2019re distracted by the day time sections of the series having little going on as far as atmosphere and background design.\\n\\n\r\n   To add to the choppy unrefined animation and art style,  the studio for some reason thought it would be cool if they added in random pan sweep shots to make things look cooler than they actually do.  My problem with this is you can\u2019t often clearly tell what is actually going on,  which is a problem that even many scenes in the Berserk animated films had. This factor applies to both the 3d and 2d sections of the series,  the 3d having way to much close up action during fight scenes and the 2d scenes having so much shit flying by at once you can\u2019t even discern what hell you just saw.   The strange, serene moments that Berserk has always had are thrown out the window so the series can constantly be in your face the entire time.\\n\\n\r\n   There is a lack of impact in everything done in the series.  Not only can the series not capture the beautiful  and awkward moments that Berserk can have,  but it can\u2019t even do impact correctly.  The Dragon Slayer is a prime victim of this.  Every episode I feel like I\u2019m watching a slow moving marble knock over a stack of dominos.   It doesn\u2019t have a presence and honestly it just isn\u2019t shown off well enough.   It\u2019s all just very dull and not very interesting to look at for 12 episodes straight.   Guts himself lacks presence overall not seeming all that bad ass and for a lot of moments, pretty weak for a guy that hunts demons for a living.  That aside, the timing is also very strange with each kill being fairly overblown and every \u201csex\u201d scene portrayed as awkwardly... sensual and almost fan-servicy to be quite honest with you. \"Fan-servicy\"  is NEVER a feeling I should get from Berserk.\\n\\n\r\n   Now horrible design choices and color contrast aside, the sound and music is absolutely atrocious.   The sound is just overall bad, you will find no calm and beauty like the theme of Guts or the sheer inspiration of songs like Forces here, just forgettable metal songs and as far as the sound effects it doesn\u2019t fare much better.  The Dragon Slayer\u2019s sound tends to be also pretty bad in the sound effects  department. For most of the series it sounds like a log being drowned under water and other sounds come out equally as muffled or flat.  The Dragon Slayer is supposed to be intimidating and powerful, yet it feels like there is simply no satisfaction to be had from any of Guts\u2019 kills.  A series where taking down larger than life demons is supposed to be gratifying shouldn\u2019t be this much of a bore to watch.  Everything feels all wrong, like this wasn\u2019t even made for Berserk fans and it just shouldn\u2019t be that way.\\n\\n\r\n  To summarize it best I guess.  Giving Berserk to a no name studio, with a track record of all zero notable titles was a red flag from the start.   This series was a mistake.  Why a studio like Madhouse,  which could have captured the franchises dark tone and storytelling or Gainax,  which specializes in the intense and psychological,  were NOT considered for this adaption is  beyond me.    This could have easily been a well-made 60+ episode anime adaption.    Instead of going the FMA Brotherhood or Hellsing Ultimate route and giving the fans and newcomers a satisfying, thrilling experience------we are left with this. \u2026. A series that won\u2019t hold up and will likely be forgotten over time, but still disappointed all the same.\\n",

            "content": "The Internet Hate Train has arrived. ALL ABOARD! WOO WOO!!!!\r\nI put off watching this series for a while because all I had heard was extremely negative! Then my inner contrarian was awakened and I reasoned that the internet anime community also hates a lot of series that I love. Maybe this series isn't so bad? WRONG! I swear this series was produced by the Rapehorse himself!\r\nBackground:\r\nThe internet anime community only has a couple \"sacred cows\" where you will get flamed to a crisp if you dare say a negative word about them. One is Legend of the Galactic Heroes and the other is the Berserkmanga. Many corners of the internet regard it above Watchmen as the greatest graphic novel of all time. 4chan loves Berserk so much that even badmouthing the manga on /pol/ would make people go \"WOAH...too far dude! Freedom of speech has limits!\" Yet despite the slavish devotion Berserk has online, Japanese producers have always been skeptical and thus rather tight with their money. The original Berserk anime had recycled animation and non-animated splash pages to a degree that was occasionally comical. The soundtrack replayed the same songs over and over. Cool portions of the manga had to be cut out. Yet it was still regarded as a classic and rightfully so. Berserk 2016 on the other hand is outright, indefensible GARBAGE!\\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters:\\n\\n\r\nBerserk 2016 already had a difficult task because the Black Swordsman Arc is... honestly the worst point in the entire manga. It has glimmers of brilliance, but is weighed down by Miura trying to be so dark and edgy it becomes unintentionally hilarious. Examples of this include the infamous rapehorse and a nun warrior burning innocent people alive while fingerblasting herself. The dialogue includes such over the top classics as \"Miracles make me wanna PUKE!\" Caska comes down with classic soap opera amnesia. Adapting this portion of the manga was always going to be hard, but Berserk 2016 flat out eviscerates Miura's work. \\n\\n\r\nRemember the creepy yet emotionally powerful Rosina Arc that helps introduce us to the new Post-Eclipse Guts? Gone. They cut out the whole thing and gave us some schmuck apostle with no backstory that we have ZERO reason to care about. Remember how morally disgusting Farnese was at first and how big a deal it was that she gradually became good and turned face? The anime version of Farnese blushes at the site of blood and has never killed anyone. Her sadism is implied briefly, but NOTHING like how she was in the manga. The best portion of the entire Black Swordsmen Arc is Miura's impressive ability to actually get the reader to forgive Farnese and want to root for her. The anime fucking ruined it! Characters are watered down, crucial backstory is cut out, and important arcs are entirely skipped. Most baffling of all is that the gore is cut way down from the movies and even the nipples are censored, let alone privates. This is fucking BERSERK! You can cut down some of the pointless squick nudity like the bathhouse chapters with Farnese and Caska. I would actually thank the anime for sparing us the cringe of Schierke\u2019s loli ass shots. However, you can\u2019t simply cut all blood and nudity of Berserk. It is too iconic and integral to the gritty feel of the story. It is true using too much blood and nudity can lead to backlash and unintentional comedy. Look no farther than the internet\u2019s favorite punching bag Elfen Lied. However, going the opposite direction and making a PG-13 Berserk actually robs Berserk of the shock and awe edge that helped Berserk stand out and win over casual fans in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nHOLY SHIT is the art awful in this series! It uses cell shading CG like Valkyria Chronicles on the early PS3 only the character art is shit and the animation is about 5 frames per second. This means the characters move clunky and unnatural like this was filmed in fucking stop motion. When the skeletons attack it looks exactly like a scene from \u201cJason and the Argonauts\u201d or \u201cArmy of Darkness\u201d. The art in the 2nd and 3rd movies greatly improved from the 1st movie, but the series looks WAY worse than the 1st movie! This art is so bad it simply has to be seen to be believed!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nRemember how the original Berserk had \u201cForces\u201d and \u201cBehelit\u201d and other memorable tracks? This soundtrack has none of that! Not to mention the voice actors are almost all amateurs because the producer clearly doesn\u2019t give a shit about this project. The worst of all though is the fucking STUPID sound that occurs every time Guts swings his sword. They go with this metallic BOOONG sound that viewers have described as an empty oil drum being hit with a hammer. This same sound happens no matter what Guts hits with the sword and turns what should be serious scenes into comedy gold. They basically turned Guts into El Kabong! Berserk shouldn\u2019t be making me think of Hanna Barbara cartoons from the 1950s!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\n1 episode of Berserk 2016: This is SHIT, maybe it will get better?\\n\r\n2 episodes of Berserk 2016: I think I\u2019m beginning to lose my sanity!\\n\r\n3 episodes of Berserk 2016: I hear it's amazing when the famous purple stuffed worm in flap-jaw space with the tuning fork does a raw blink on Hara-Kiri Rock. I need scissors! 61! \\n\r\n4 episodes of Berserk 2016: DELETE! DELETE! DELETE! DELETE!",

            "content": "It truly saddens me that this new adaptation of Berserk we receive after patiently waiting for almost two decades had to turn out like it did. This is a far cry from what the older adaptation managed to achieve and is regarded as a timeless classic, then again the previous anime was working with arguably the best source material out there with that being the 'Golden Age' arc. The decline in quality was to be expected as Berserk certainly peaked during the conclusion of that arc with the events of the Eclipse. The problem with this current adaptation was the fact that the script writerswere adamant about fully adapting the Conviction arc but at the expense of rushing the Black Swordsman arc and completely omitting the Lost Children side story arc. The latter is understandable due to the censorship that modern anime are subject to and so with current regulations it was an uncertainty from the beginning it was announced. \\n\\n\r\nThis adaptation focuses on Guts trying to locate and eventually rescue Casca who has very much turned into an invalid after the traumatic events of the Eclipse. This is mainly due to the negligence of Rickert who as a former Band of the Hawk member was concerned with the mental state of Caska who was under his protection the whole time. This responsibility is ultimately Guts' one in the end but would make his main objective seemingly more difficult. Learning about the details of Caska's movements, Guts along with a new companion named Isidro who is obsessed with him and aspires to emulate his heroics find themselves in the desolate refugee camp called Albion. This is where the tower of 'Conviction' run by the Holy Iron Chain Knights is located and where the main events takes place.\\n\\n\r\nApparently the damage was already done when the fans of Berserk realised that the first few episodes did not cater to their expectations. Let's be real here, anyone here knowing Berserk's relationship with CG animation should have had the mindset of wanting an average/decent adaptation, only to get a big f*ck you when butchering the source material. If you are reading this then you are a brave soul indeed after experiencing this abomination that may have scarred you permanently. The verdict of most fans by now will probably be dismissing the show and refusing to acknowledge its existence. \\n\\n\r\nThe series barely manages to retain the authenticity of the manga with it being a decent portrayal of a dark fantasy series. It still possesses that gritty, inhumane atmosphere that is commonly associated with Berserk. It could even pass off as a post-apocalyptic setting due to the state of events within Albion where poverty and desperation is strife due to an outbreak of the plague in certain cities in the Midlands leading to an influx of refugees seeking help. Religion is the main theme for this arc as it is seen as the way forward when experiencing hard times - basically the only means of salvation for these commoners who would do anything to survive. This is evident in the numerous amounts of individuals being put to death after being accused of being heretics hence is linked to the tower of 'Conviction', where all sorts of horrific torture and other forms of extreme brutality taking place in the name of religion.\\n\\n\r\nThe hate for the animation techniques used in this anime is probably the single reason why many dropped the show. I abhor the use of 3D and 2D animation ever mixing and to me are like oil and water when done in a mediocre fashion. The ratio between the two is the most disturbing factor personally, as I'm actually impressed by the hand drawn animations which are sparse and are used occasionally as a means of conveying certain facial expressions such as Guts purely concentrating for the kill. This is short lived though as we are expected to put up with the unsightly 3D which infuriates me.\\n\\n\r\n3D models of the characters make up the majority of the animation but are heavily altered with shadings being applied to everyone and the rest of the designs being drawn over by the animators. If there is a positive from this show (though not many) the character designs are consistent but is not always the case as there are times when normal animation is used randomly in certain scenes such as the girls from Luca's group.\\n\\n\r\nThe more episodes you watch, you gradually become more accustomed to the CG which would be case for those who managed to stay on. There is no smooth movement from the animation as it can look jerky at times mainly through different shot compositions such as close ups and its use in the background. The last thing that needs mentioning was the opening had good animation but that is just pure deception compared to what actually takes place.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is one aspect that probably goes unscathed in my review as the voice actors did a reasonable job at performing their characters. Characters such as Farnese and Mozgus sound just like I had imagined them when reading the manga which was unexpected. The soundtrack is a slight disappointment as it can't compare to the greatness of Susumu Hirasawa's one for the original series. This series just has one theme that I find worthwhile whereas the other has plenty to offer in comparison despite it being half an hour long. The background sound use is adequately used in most cases except for Guts and his use of his broadsword which can come off as being similar to striking a metal bannister when obliterating his enemies.\\n\\n\r\nI was very much hyped about Berserk getting an adaptation because everyone hates cliffhangers after the 1997 Berserk finale. I wouldn't even call this a direct sequel as it assumes you have prior knowledge of the manga when watching and for an anime-only would be difficult to follow. This show is not worth your time and so like they say, avoid it like the plague.\\n",

            "content": "Lets discuss things that aren't the animation, which is terrible, but everyone's already said that. Whats more offensive is their handling of the actual material. Even at the ten episode mark, the show has already taken extreme liberties with the stories it does include, and it skips the Lost Children arc entirely. What remains has been butchered beyond recognition, as they rework, reorganize, and repurpose to try and condense volumes of content into handfuls of episodes. Its fair to say that things what work in manga form don't always work in an anime, and therefore to rework some content is not only permissible, but insome cases it can be commendable. This, however, is just a hackjob, rushed in an attempt to cash in on the micro-hype generated by the films from a couple of years ago. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the sound design is atrocious. Gut's sword sounds like it's hollow, and makes the exact same *KWANG* sound for 90% of the things it collides with. I would not be surprised if there were a dozen stock effects total that they just layered on as approximations. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. The greatest tragedy is the OP, which is beautiful. It's 2D, it's well animated, and even the song is catchy. However, you then go from that, to the 3D abomination of the show. It's like a minute-long tease that shows you what could've been and then asks you to sit through what you actually got. \\n\\n\r\nI do not know why they got a studio known for it's romances and slice-of-life series, but they've fundamentally asked Anne Rice to direct Clint Eastwood. \\n\\n\r\n0/10, \"-the manga was better.\"",

            "content": "Berserk returns with a whimper than a roar! The return of Guts and his tale feels like a horribly put together fan project.\r\nStory 4/10\r\nBerserk initially had many fans, myself included, anticipating its return. In this installment of the once great franchise the story and plot lacked the intensity & excitement the original series presented. This series was supposed to follow the manga according to what is on file in the MAL/ANN database. For the most part, it didn't follow the original source as much and sort of pulled random things out its ass to improvise. I found this to be both unprofessional and lazy onthe director\u2019s end. Of the many, one of the most disappointing things about the story is its overall presentation. It comes off ass.. (He he, I wrote ass) as, lazy. \\n\\n\r\nIt appeared as if Berserk was only made just to cash in on the franchise some more. The story is painfully weak in terms of plot & narrative. The beginning and middle, rising action, parts of the story were perhaps the biggest turn off.  The amount of action, gore and death in the story felt limited. This ruined a majority of my experience with the beginning and conclusion of the story. I strongly believe that the writing could have been much better. \\n\r\nFew moments into the introduction, the first episode pretty much plays homage to the original anime series. Guts arrive at bar or brothel saves a woman, etc. Except, now in the 2016 version Guts saves a woman, befriends a possibly homo-sexual fairy, who doesn't shout \"Hey, Listen\" and the two become buddies. I don't remember the time it takes for all of these events to happen, however I believe it was about 10 minutes into the show that I wanted to drop it simply because of that. The stories appeal is bad enough to make even people who haven't seen the show turn away from it. Lastly, the main story gets even worse when it gets taken over by an awful intrusive sub-plot that focuses more on some of the most uninteresting characters in the series. This isn't so much the case in the manga however, I digress.   \\n\\n\r\nTowards the middle of the series, during maybe episode 6-9 (69.. ha ha children, see I have sex jokes) the story focuses less on Guts and his goal to save or abduct his mentally disable, brown sugar skinned goddess. Instead the story decides to focus more on the supporting and non-supporting characters. This wouldn't be so bad if only the characters were not so annoying, troublesome rather. For example when the prostitutes arrive, and Elaine is first show, at this point in the story is where I felt things became horrible. . The settings that the story took place in were not as visually horrifying nor did they set the tone for any new developments. The narrative, or rather, the way that the story was told, it failed improve successful elements that the original story used. \\n\r\nThe unfortunate thing is that although the story is somewhat part of the original work, the way that its' been directed so far, makes Berserk feel like a horribly put together fan project. Shallow story, coupled with bad action scenes, animation and horrible dialogue made me cringe.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKentaro Miura should be ashamed for agreeing his work to be animated in CGI poorly. His Penmanship, his detail in the original work is God-Like! (No exaggerations needed.) The Golden Age Arc of the series looks like perfection compared to this ugly, unappealing and awful, simply awful visuals. Details, there was a lack of the detailed gore like dismembered bodies and such for berserk. The dark settings and somber tone berserk once had seemed to have vanished. For some strange reason, berserk, the settings seemed to have taken a JRPG style setting. Woods, forest, deserted battle fields etc. Detailed animation on these settings was very minimal and unfortunately took away a lot of the enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nIn all honest though, the type of CGI, the art style is what ruined this once great series for me. I felt that I focused too much on how bad the art was that it completely turned me away from the story. It needed more work, it needed to feel more realistic not forced! Or over the type.. Or \"Edgy\" as the hip people say.\\n\r\nCGI, CGI, I still feel like CGI based anime is still a work in development. I would not be surprised if Berserk was used for this very reason and we were all the test audiences. If this is the case I do fear what else animation studios are planning to redo or \"re-master\" in full on CGI. I digress, using CGI over the traditional style that made berserk such an amazing series that is what hurt the series the most for me. There was simply no enjoyment, nothing to saw \"wow what amazing settings or detail, and I feel that it was the CGI to blame for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was on and off. Sometimes I felt that a majority of the actors were over-exaggerating when it came to screaming. When there were serious moments in the dialogue, I wasn\u2019t convinced that events were as bad as the characters said they were. The soundtrack wasn\u2019t impressive for the show.  Fight scenes were not nearly as intense because of the music. \\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI was not impressed with any of the characters. Lack of character development and bland personalities is what kept me from making any sort of connection. As mentioned earlier everyone was riddled with problems and awful traits.\\n\\n\r\nThe show didn't seem like it was ready for release. It's sort of like a video game... which ironically there is a game coming out. There were so many problems with it that it needs patches to fix them. I felt like what was released, wasn't the shows full potential. It almost feels rushed. Perhaps they didn't have any editors to look over it before release. I don't know what they were thinking when releasing this. However, it totally could use work on the story, animation, and settings. Maybe a dialogue that isn't so stale a cat wouldn't even eat it. Overall, I simply was not impressed with Berserk 2016. \\n",

            "content": "Berserk is one of the most beloved manga series of all time, with a successful anime in the nineties that covered the famed \u201cgolden age\u201d arc. But the manga is so much more than that arc, so when a series of movies were announced, fans were rightfully disappointed that it was a retelling of the same arc. Well, come 2016 and we\u2019re finally out of the golden age, with an anime promising to show us Guts as the \u201cBlack Swordsman,\u201d but can it do justice to the legendary manga it spawned from? Let\u2019s find out!\r\nWhen adapting a long, dark fantasy manga with highly detailed art,what studio would you think to pick for the anime? Madhouse, famous for the stunning visuals of Claymore or Overlord? Bones, with their amazing talents for action like the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist and Kurau: Phantom Memory? Perhaps a-1 pictures, known for Sword Art Online, or maybe Deen, creators of widely acclaimed anime series Fate/Stay Night?\\n\\n\r\nNo, none of these studios can handle such a complex, detailed narrative, nor can they even hope to live up to the chaotic scenes of battle from the manga. And of course, none could possibly live up to the incredible artwork present in the manga. No, there\u2019s only one studio clearly cut out to do this job: Studio Millepensee.\\n\\n\r\nWith their work on teekyuu they\u2019ve shown they can tell complex, long form stories in a short span of time, which means that they won\u2019t need 100, 50, or even 25 episodes to tell the story of Guts. No, a mere 12 episode run time might as well be the same as the total length of Detective Conan to them! And the frantic nature of the animation shows they can do justice to berserk\u2019s fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nMove over 2D, your time has come. Far too many anime feel the need to bow to the pressures of tradition, following the old methods that were pioneered back in the 40s for gods sake! It\u2019s time to move forward, and Berserk 2016 is a perfect example of this. The 3DCG animation featured in Berserk is stunning, the best CG I\u2019ve seen since Knights of Sidonia. It really feels like you\u2019re living in the world of Sword of the Berserk: Guts\u2019 Rage, the classic dreamcast game.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the camera cuts so as to obscure most of the action is a daring, bold choice. It shows just how larger than life both Guts and his sword really are, so large they can\u2019t even fit into the screen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nTo accompany this torrential storm of cgi animation, we have a kick-ass rock soundtrack, exactly the kind of music you\u2019d expect out of a dark fantasy series. Each song would sound right at home on a nickleback or disturbed album, and never once do they fail to fit the tone of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects however, are a different beast entirely. No cheesy sword shwing noises here, no sir. Only gritty, realistic metal clangs. The static, low quality nature of the effects only further enhances how realistic they sound. If I had one complaint, it would be that sometimes guts\u2019 dragonslayer doesn\u2019t clang loud enough for such an impressive weapon, but it is certainly an improvement over what we\u2019ve seen before.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nMillepensee has made the brilliant decision to only adapt the good parts of the manga, much like Mappa\u2019s recent Ushio and Tora. Skipping the black swordsman arc entirely, it jumps straight into the real action of the series. Never in my wildest dreams would I have expected them to reach Farnese by episode two, but they pulled it off somehow.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in another amazing move, they introduced original content into the third episode, drastically improving the pacing of the story in ways I never dreamed possible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nEach character has been distilled down to their base, root personality traits. This is a good thing, as often times the manga can be too subtle and detailed for its own good. This is much easier to follow, meaning this anime is actually BETTER then the manga it\u2019s adapting, similar to FMA 2003.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like shows like Claymore, Overlord, Knights of Sidonia, or Sword Art Online, watch this anime immediately. I was shocked every second of this show, I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes, Berserk 2016 is an experience you have to have for yourself, I recommend checking it out on my favorite streaming site, Kissanime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nRarely does a show come around that does everything as well as this, thanks for recommending this to me Kotaku, you\u2019re the best source for anime news I can think of. I for one can't wait for the second season of this masterwork, which was announced at the end of the first cour.",

            "content": "Now I feel like Guts standing in front of the army of the new Berserk hating people. Bring it on then! No seriously I believe that many people rate this anime focused way too much on one thing, not looking at it objectively. \r\nLet's start with the main problem, the animation. It is bad! When I though I got used to it after the first episodes but another punch in the face came. Silly censorship incarnated into characters with no genitals. The animation is a mix of CG and drawn one. The CG parts are really strange. However it's not like a total fail. Someparts were beautiful. Some were sadly, hilarious. So I can't agree with statements like \"The whole animation is terrible!\". More like \"Some parts are funny. (When they are not supposed to be funny.)\"\\n\\n\r\nEnough of that. If you forget the animation, then this anime is pretty good. Exactly what I expected and wanted to see as a sequel to the original series. The dark and raw atmosphere is still there, even darker. Guts is as badass as always and you even see some old characters not only in flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also new characters that are really well made with a focus on their inner feelings. They are just humans after all and they act like that. There are some inner conflicts and deep thoughts. Also some epic quotes that we \"anime only watchers\" were waiting for!\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are very specific, especially Guts and his sword slashes will leave a trace in your memory. The music is a treasure. Really an amazing OST. (Susumu and his Hai Yo really reminded me the previous anime adaptations.) \\n\\n\r\nSo I have really enjoyed this show despite the bad expectations I had after watching the trailer. I was really wondering if I should watch or drop it. Glad I stayed. You know it was also announced that the season 2 is coming next year. Give it a shot, survive the animation torture and you'll never regret it!",

            "content": "*Minor spoilers for Golden Age and Berserk 2016 below*\r\nMiura\u2019s Berserk is a classic manga series beloved by many and deals with dark, gritty violence and mature themes. Miura started writing Berserk in 1989; however due to many factors, most of which I am not aware of, the manga has turned into Hiatus x Hiatus over the past decade or so. Berserk received an anime adaption in the 1990s covering the famous Golden Age Arc, a flashback/prequel that covers roughly 13 manga volumes, and ever since fans have been asking for a sequel. This manga is held in such high esteem by so many that asequel would never be able to live up to its hype. Manga lovers love the manga so much, and when they saw the first episode of Berserk 2016 and didn\u2019t get exactly what they had yearned for for twenty years they immediately wrote it off as a horrible adaption. I have read the manga chapters this anime adapts and, as a whole, this is a very good adaption of the Conviction Arc. \\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10):\\n\\n\r\n\tBerserk 2016 starts two years after the Golden Age Arc with Guts wandering the countryside looking for apostles so that he can question them about the God Hand, a collection of five demon-like creatures that follow the guidance of the Idea of Evil, or God. The Idea of Evil is an entity born from humanity\u2019s unconscious desire for something to blame suffering on. Among the God Hand is Femto, who was once the human Griffith and Guts\u2019 best friend. During the events of the Eclipse two years ago, Griffith became Femto by sacrificing the Band of the Hawk, his army of companions. Only Guts and Casca escape, but not without injury: Guts has lost an eye and an arm and Casca has lost her mind due to a truly horrible gang rape. Both are branded as sacrifices and these brands bleed whenever evil is near. As these brands also attract evil beings, Casca is kept safe at a friend\u2019s house while Guts roams the countryside killing apostles. He is haunted by a demon-like baby, the remains of Guts and Casca\u2019s miscarried child after Femto raped her. \\n\\n\r\n\tGuts\u2019 experiences during the Eclipse have shaped him into a cynical, violent, untrusting person. He saves Puck and inspires Isidro at a bar but doesn\u2019t warm up to either of them until later on in the story. At the same time, the Holy Iron Chain Knights have been searching the countryside for the prophesized Hawk of Darkness, a being that would plunge the world into a dark age. The Knights, led by Farnese, believe this Hawk to be Guts after encountering him in a forest and they become recurring antagonists for him throughout the anime. Guts eventually learns that Casca has been missing and goes off in search of her at the Tower of Conviction. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe most compelling part of this arc, besides the characters, is how Miura handles the concept of religion in this world. The Holy See parallels the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages and the Tower of Conviction is home to an extensive torture chamber. Refugees from war and famine surround the Tower and daily \u201cheretics\u201d are dragged into the Tower to confess their sins. One priest claims that only priests are able to interpret the Holy Scriptures. The God Hand are continuously referred to as angels, leading to the question: How do you know what you are praying to is actually a benevolent God? Some of the heretics actually go off to unknowingly worship one of the God Hand. As a whole, the followers of the Holy See are ultimately painted as hypocrites, either too blind in their faith to realize that they aren\u2019t worshiping a benevolent God or using religion as a way to excuse their personality defects. This arc is about surviving, and in a world where anyone could claim you were a heretic, all most of the refugees can do is bow their heads and do what they are told. In the end, those that ran away from the Tower survive, while those who believe in God and run to the Tower are killed. As a non-religious person, I could probably write pages on all the ideas that popped into my head about religion. It\u2019s simply fascinating. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\\n\\n\r\n\tAnother compelling part of Berserk is the rich characters that make up the story. Guts in particular is especially riveting as he slashes his way through his enemies. After the Eclipse, he cares for no one except Casca and he is a violent, untrusting person. He doesn\u2019t get much development here in the Conviction Arc, but I\u2019m excited to see him grow next season. Puck is my favorite and is the series\u2019 comic relief character along with Isidro. When he isn\u2019t a chestnut head, he usually badgers Guts about being a better person and is a source of morality for Guts early on in his quest for revenge. Unfortunately, most of this material is cut from the anime. Nina is annoying at best, but I think it\u2019s important to realize that she represents the average person and she does what she does to survive.  Lastly, Farnese is simply horrid here in this first arc as a devout follower of the Holy See. There is a lot of backstory to her that makes her who she is. Eventually, her faith has been too shaken by her encounters with Guts and malevolence that follows him. I\u2019m excited to see her grow next season as well as her character gets so much better. Griffith\u2019s character is also fascinating as the series\u2019 main antagonist, however, that is a story for another time. \\n\\n\r\nArt (4/10) and Sound (8/10): \\n\\n\r\n\tUnfortunately, the animation is terrible. Many have already complained about the awful CGI that makes up the majority of the animation, so I won\u2019t go into too much detail. Towards the end, the quality gets better, though that may be more because I got used to it. I will admit, if the story wasn\u2019t Berserk level quality, this anime would be shit. The sound is better, though the sound Guts\u2019 sword makes is jarring at first. The opening and Hai Yo are amazing. \\n\\n\r\n\tMany manga lovers will complain that the first arc and the Lost Children arc were cut and cry foul. They were cut for reasons we can only speculate on, though I do believe that the graphic depictions of children dying, killing each other, and being brutally raped were a factor in the Lost Children arc being cut. Perhaps I\u2019m just more sensitive to that sort of thing. In any case, this anime was meant to be an adaption of the Conviction Arc with background plot sprinkled into the first few episodes. Should they have marketed the anime to reflect that? Probably. Should people really be so up in arms that it cut material? No. Anime adaptions do that all the time. To be upset about such a thing is ridiculous. It\u2019s like being mad that the Harry Potter screenplays weren\u2019t directly lifted word for word from the book. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) and Overall (8/10): \\n\\n\r\n\tBerserk 2016 is a good story packaged with shitty animation. The main problem many people have with this adaption is the animation and the fact that the manga wasn\u2019t copied panel by panel to match the Berserk anime image most dreamed of. Berserk may not be my favorite manga, but I do understand your pain (I'm a One Piece fan and the anime is killing me slowly). Yes, the animation was bad. Yes, it doesn\u2019t do the manga justice. Yes, the best thing about it is Miura\u2019s story. But is it still a good, entertaining anime and I believe that any fan of action, adventure, or fantasy will end up liking it. And if you\u2019re thirsty for more when you\u2019re done, I would recommend starting at Volume 1, Chapter 1!\\n",

            "content": "Ah Berserk. Yes, the series that fans have been waiting what seems like ages for a new adaptation. Anime adapted from manga isn\u2019t likely going to be perfect and most often times or not, they\u2019re not. Berserk is an interesting case though. The series feels like a bad date that the studio, producers, and director tries to make the best out of. In practice, you should not expect Berserk to be a dream come true. Sure, it\u2019s what fans have been eager for but the tradition of trying to match a series of such high expectations is far from reality. Berserk isn\u2019t a show that\u2019sgoing to change from that. \\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the manga, it\u2019s imperative that fans are familiarized with the franchise. If you plan to watch the series completely fresh, then it\u2019s going to be like a recipe for disaster experience. Taken for granted, the new Berserk is series focuses main protagonist Guts as the Black Swordsman that also serves as a direct sequel of the Golden Age arc.\\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, the first episode of the new Berserk series will be painful to get through. Remember that first time when you went to the dentist and had to get a tooth taken out? That\u2019s kind of how it feels like with the impression of the pilot episode. First impressions are important and unfortunately, Berserk dropped the ball. On paper, the animation quality is difficult to get used to. It uses a fusion hybrid between 2D and 3D while the action scenes looks like it\u2019s made from broken cardboards. Mediocre isn\u2019t even a word to describe the effort as the quality falls more into abomination. On the story perspective, the series is a dark fantasy journey featuring Guts. As the Black Swordsman, he is now more of an avenger, seeking vengeance against his former friend Griffith. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the storytelling about the infamous Eclipse, then you\u2019ll want to revisit a bit of that by either watching the previous season or the final movie of the trilogy. Now on his journey, he is also accompanied by a mysterious elf named Buck and later on gains new allies on the way. While the animation bombed, the story itself is also a mixed bag because by adaptation standards, it sometimes hits the right marks while other times doesn\u2019t. In retrospect, it\u2019s a condensed adaptation with some chapters being followed faithfully while others are reshuffled.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter dynamics revolves around Guts and his character relationships with the people he comes across with. Some more noticeable ones include Farnese (a leader of the Holy Iron Chain Knights), the ever so cheerful Puck, and runaway thief Isidro. One of the most important relationships from the franchise (if you can remember) was with Casca. However, the new anime downplays that until later on in the story when the two actually meets each other again. In the meantime, Guts\u2019 personality has changed greatly after the nightmarish experience he suffered from events of the Eclipse. He is both angry and also confused at what Griffith has done. Various flashbacks throughout the new season also shows that Guts suffers guilt because of how helpless he was, especially when Casca became a victim of violation. That aside, other characters introduced in the season have some memorable moments such as the courageous Luca. Even the Skull Knight makes a nostalgic appearance but like so many times, he is still a mysterious puzzle. Other characters such as Nina is mostly forgettable and in general, it\u2019s not hard to realize that the characterization is rushed.\\n\\n\r\nAs with most dark fantasy stories, expect plenty of violence. Especially for the case of Berserk, we have mature content such as horse rape, body dismemberment, bloody massacres, satanic-like rituals, etc. There\u2019s not much room for humor except for perhaps the occasional comic relief provided by Puck or Isidiro. However, I do give some praise for the show as more episodes progressed. There are even some content that is adapted frame by frame with certain episodes. In keeping tradition of the mature content, some of violence is uncensored. My only pique is the awkward nudity and sex scenes especially with the non-existent nipples on female characters. I guess they had to remove some of that to fit the content to be tolerable for airing on TV. In the meantime, the show follows its tagline pretty well:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cSleepless nights shall begin\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nAnd damn right they shall. \\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, it sort of feels like Berserk\u2019s production staff thrown themselves into this project without being fully ready. Early episodes gave us weak impression of the animation quality whether it\u2019s the action scenes or character designs. Luckily, the series does improve a bit more later on as some chapters are even adapted symmetrically frame by frame. In general, it ends up being more of a mixed bag that bounces between trashy to decent for its animation.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the new Berserk really shines when it comes to the music and soundtrack. If there\u2019s anything memorable to take to heart for the first few episodes, it would be the OST. The stellar choreography combined with its instrumental style will make you awe. Character voice mannerism is generally decent with Guts still showing off his manliness and why he lives up to his Black Swordsman nickname.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s quite easy to mock the new Berserk at first. The animation looks like it\u2019s a preview of a CGI video game and the storytelling has a rocky start. Yet as time went on, fans can feel somewhat more appreciated by the adaptation. It probably isn\u2019t at a level where we\u2019d expect to every episode to be 1:1 in terms of faithfulness. In a perfect world, maybe. But for Berserk? That\u2019s more of a fantasy. Still, I would give the new Berserk a try. It\u2019s nostalgic enough to give viewers some treat. And plus, who wouldn\u2019t want to see some ass kicking from the Black Swordsman himself?\\n",

            "content": "Be careful what you wish for, because you might just receive it.\r\nFans of the original 1997 series of Berserk, and the manga by extension, could not have imagined how dangerous this desire could be.  Diving into the realm of retelling one of the hallmark stories of the entire manga industry, must have seemed foolproof \u2014 or, at the very least, risk-adverse.  But, alas, even the strongest source material is no match for horrendous 3D animation and mediocre directorial talent.  Something is not always superior to nothing, and, in fact, may induce detrimental blemishes on an otherwise fantastic series.  Not only doesthis new series mutilate an ongoing classic, but it distorts the perception of Guts to a younger generation of anime viewers.  Diminishing the chances of future installments that are faithful to the franchise.  That being said, after viewing the abhorrent farrago that is Berserk (2016), I doubt fans will be clamoring for additional adaptations in the near future.  Only time can heal the ocular wounds that were inflicted upon viewers while watching this abomination.\\n\\n\r\nA myriad of words come to mind when watching the animation of Berserk (2016); eliminating the numerous profane words, however, leaves us with one encapsulating word: nauseating.  Seriously.  The camera never stops moving.  Constant panning shots make it exceedingly difficult for the viewer to know where they should be focusing their attention.  Simple details like depth perception are completely disregarded, as I honestly could not decipher the distance between objects and people on several occasions.  Spinning the camera around characters, particularly in the battle scenes, obfuscates characters relative positions on the screen, making it challenging to follow actions and movements.  Pausing the episode(s) to relieve symptoms of vertigo, however, leave the viewer with the unholy prospect of staring at the egregious character designs that even Stevie Wonder would find repulsive.  Everything about Guts, and the other characters by default, seems so stiff, inflexible, and unyielding.  Translating this to battle scenes makes the characters look like rigid action figures that a teenage kid decided to film with his iPhone.  Its not a pleasant viewing experience.  Let us not forget the superfluous cross-shading implanted on the character\u2019s faces to feign complexity and detail.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the infliction of pain does not carry any verifiable weight.  As evidence of this fact, rewatch episode two when Guts is shackled by the Holy Iron Chain Knights and is whipped by Lady Farnese.  Immediately after Guts received numerous lashes, he is removed from the tent with no visible wounds.  This would imply that during the show\u2019s lengthy hiatus, Guts developed the ability to use a modified version of Wolverine\u2019s  healing factor \u2014 or, more plausible, the animators were indolent [expletive word implied] who couldn\u2019t be bothered to do their job.  Or perhaps they simply forgot.  In either case, it portrays an apathetic staff with poor leadership and direction.  Speaking of which, why was an anime studio with past credentials of: Teekyuu 5; Usakame; and Wake up, Girls! Shin Shou (there\u2019s a valid reason you haven\u2019t heard of these anime); hired to revive the story of Guts?  Surely, some other studio with an aptitude for handling intense action sequences would be more suitable for this kind of work.  Of course, this wishful thinking, for all intensive purposes, is a moot point.  We are stuck lamenting the appalling state in which Berserk currently finds itself in.\\n\\n\r\nThe substandard animation not only contaminates one\u2019s visual acuity, but it corrupts the story itself.  Herein lies the problem with adapting a manga from the great Kentarou Miura.  The level of detail placed into the character\u2019s expressions, alone, tells a story in and of itself.  This, unfortunately, disrupts several key moments, as character expressions do not convey the proper tone.  A quick review of the manga will exemplify this statement, and give the viewer a better perspective and appreciation of Berserk the manga.  In terms of specific source material that was altered or omitted altogether, there are two arcs, in particular, that have significant differences from the manga: parts of The Black Swordsman Arc, when Guts attains the Behelit and the reader learns about his quest to track down Apostles (we are also introduced to The God Hand \u2014 and Griffith by default); and The Lost Children Chapter, which doesn\u2019t necessarily tie into the main story, but highlights how coarse Guts has become since the events of the eclipse.  Skipped source material aside, the story that is covered \u2014 at least, from my perspective \u2014 feels unnecessarily accelerated, making events seem disconnected from each other, as opposed to being part of an interconnected narrative.  The anime staff, in my opinion, needs to eliminate ambiguous lapses by slowing the story down to allow events to occur organically, .  As it stands, the anime feels like a bullet point presentation of the manga, moving from one section to the next without consideration for fluidity.\\n\\n\r\nAs we have established, there seems to be a general misunderstanding from the anime staff regarding the source material and how it should be presented.  This, unfortunately, extends into the music selection as well.  The opening track has a punk rock vibe that is incompatible with Guts personal plight.  We must understand the incomprehensible circumstances of Guts life (from birth to the present moment) and how his anger conceals the tortured soul that resides within.  Having a rapid paced, generic sounding opening track neglects the inner turmoil that most of the characters must overcome in their day to day lives.  Furthermore, the opening spoils most of the critical elements from The Golden Age Arc, diminishing the prospect of new viewers wanting to go back and watch the original series/movies (although, the movies were quite the gallimaufry themselves).\\n\\n\r\nRecommending this new iteration of Berserk is a sin of the worst kind.  Okay, well, there are worse atrocities than watching a horrendous anime, but you understand my point.  Rather than allow the proverbial rape horse to confiscate your puerile anime innocence, do yourself a favor: read the manga, and pretend this anime never existed.",

            "content": "Finally we get another Berserk anime adaption, we can't help but expect highly. Of course it's fine to expect high but for your own good, put those expectations away and listen to what I have to say. \r\nThis season of Berserk brings us a totally different animation, camera angles and sound effects. I will explain these 3 in detail below.\r\nANIMATION:\r\nThis time CG is used for the entire anime. Not like the movies, this is done in just CG with it's own unique style. This unique style isn't interesting to be honest, it's just how the characters were adapted by the studio. The character always havefaded lines on them. The reason why they put them there I don't know. In any case the CG can get very bad, this also makes it difficult for us to get into and actually concentrate.\\n\\n\r\nCAMERA ANGLES:\\n\r\nThis is important for any anime to succeed, having a great camera movement and positioning. Unfortunately this anime didn't have neither. It was very messy, this leaves the audience confused at times because the camera angles doesn't follow the rules. This is no doubt the biggest flaw.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nop&ed - The opening is bait, it's very catchy but the anime doesn't live up to what the op shows us. \\n\r\nsound effects - Right now get two saucepans and clash them againts eachother and get used to the sound. That sound is a very similar to the sound effect of Guts sword. I personally like it so i'm not complaining but there is a lot of criticism about this. If's not metal then there isn't much to discuss.\\n\r\nsound tracks - Very good tracks that work well for this anime. Sometimes the tracks are used wrongly but overall the soundtracks play the most important part.\\n\\n\r\nThose features in Berserk (2016) is what made it unsuccessful. ^\\n\\n\r\nCONTENT:\\n\r\nArcs skipped - 2\\n\r\nFiller amount - almost a whole episode\\n\r\nStory - interesting and fun at the same time. Not great progress but good development.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nIt's disappointing, but you shouldn't lose hope in the modern Berserk. It improves but not enough to prevent users dropping it. It's your decision on what your going to do but remember that this might be the last Berserk series we going to get. You could always wait and wait for a doubtful better adaption.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTATS:\\n\\n\r\n(6 weeks ago)\\n\r\nMembers:106,012\\n\r\nUsers scored: 43,559\\n\r\nRating: 6.76\\n\\n\r\n(Current)\\n\r\nMembers:110,603  (4,591+)\\n\r\nUsers scored: 46,412  (2,853+)\\n\r\nRating: 6.77  (0.01+)\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: 6/6/17 21:10 PM\\n\r\nEpisodes watched: 12\\n\r\nModified by Jeikobu11\\n\\n",

And on top of all they include nearly all parts of the storry i missed in the \"97 anime. \r\nAnd even if u are not lucky about it.. u dont need to watch the anime.

            "content": "As you probably know, Berserk is one of the most well-respected and loved manga series off all time, being serialized for over 27 years. With an anime adaptation made in a late 90\u2019s and its three remake movies that came out not too long ago, Berserk\u2019s well-known flashback arc got a complete adaptation, even if it wasn\u2019t the most loyal. But never has Berserk got an adaptation of everything that happens after the events of the Golden Age arc, until recently that is. The 2016 anime adapts its sequel arc, the Conviction arc (albeit skimming its introductory arc and cutting out a filler mini-arc). Thoughit may not be the adaptation fans were hoping, and it sure isn\u2019t getting much praise, I found it hard not to enjoy this adaptation, even with its obvious flaws. Despite the amateurish directing, inconsistent pacing, and some horrid, horrid CGI animations, the anime is able to overcome its flaws with good characterization, great style/tone and some amazing background music. No matter how bad an adaptation Berserk gets, nothing can overshadow Miura\u2019s talentless writing and world-building as long as it\u2019s adapting the manga.\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nA popular misbelief amongst newcomers is that the new Berserk anime is an alternate version of the previous adaptations, and that you can watch it without watching the previous ones. That is absolutely false! This adaptation is a sequel to the Golden Age arc so unless if you haven\u2019t watch the 90\u2019s TV series or the three CGI movies, you better watch those first. This is the first time Berserk got an adaptation of what happened after the events of the Eclipse and how Guts\u2019 revenge went. The story of the Conviction arc is about the now \u201cbranded\u201d Guts finding the now \u201cvegetable-state\u201d Casca while fighting against a religious cult and a whole lot of Apostles that will hunt Guts down until he\u2019s dead. It\u2019s a nice follow-up to the dark and disturbing end of the Golden Age arc which focuses less on a Guts who wants to find out what he values, and more on the Guts who wants to protect what he values the most. Though the story doesn\u2019t feel as impactful and enjoyable as how it was depicted in the manga due to its directing problems and weird pacing. And the animation quality sure didn\u2019t help either. But due to Miura\u2019s excellent writing in the manga, even a mediocre adaptation can\u2019t cover up the good things Berserk has to offer. \\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nDespite the remarks others make about this adaptation, this is actually quite a loyal adaptation of the Conviction arc. Not much of that arc was actually cut out, but pacing was quite uneven. Some episodes adapted more chapters than other making this adaptation somewhat a bumpy ride. But other than that, the anime did the same thing the manga did. There\u2019s one change in the location for the third episode though, but nothing too jarring. However, a mini-arc that takes place prior to the Conviction arc was skipped, although the skipped mini-arc plays no major role in the overall story. And the Black Swordsman arc got skimmed\u2026 again! But again, it doesn\u2019t make a big difference. But the biggest problem with this Berserk adaptation is the directing. Despite the fact that the style was just like the manga and the tone is similar to manga (including the lighthearted moments too), the way the anime was presented felt weird to say the least. Due to the lack of proper transitions between scenes, it feels like as if the anime is jumping between scenes, and it makes the overall experience feel jarring. And although the comedic moments are the same as the manga, the tonal shift feels jarring in the anime. But this is a common problem between many manga adaptations where the comedic panels can\u2019t be properly placed in a serious situation without feeling jarring. Also, some of the cinematography in the anime is weird too. The close-ups for the character faces are a little too close up and the camera moves around too much during action scenes, making it a little nauseous. However, whenever the camera follows the Dragonslayer, it\u2019s pretty damn cool.\\n\r\nPresentation: 2/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nThe anime doesn\u2019t waste time on characterization for Guts since it assumes you\u2019ve watched the Golden Age arc (and you should before watching this anime). Guts, who is now branded for restless nights of being hunted, is now bloodthirsty to kill the person who he once considered his first friend and the first person who truly understood Guts. The story of Berserk has always been about Guts and this anime is no exception. Guts is already a well-developed character by the start of the series, however he gets more improvements to his characterization. This anime establishes that Guts is more than a man with a vengeance, but also a man willing to protect the only thing he loves. The other major returning character is Casca, a once strong-willed woman who is now mentally broken and unstable. There\u2019s not much to develop for her character due to her current state, but she\u2019s relevant for the plot. A character that was cut out from the 90\u2019s adaptation makes a debut in this series. Puck, who was originally cut out do to him being a comic relief character, now is in this anime to add a bit of humor and commentary. His character is handled faithfully and his chemistry with Guts is fun. Also, due to a mini-arc that develops on Guts and Puck\u2019s relationship being cut out, the relationship feels a tad weaker compared to the manga. Talking about comic relief characters, and new character named Isidro is introduced and he\u2019s a nice addition to the comic relief. He\u2019s not a complex character or anything (well not until the next arc), but he\u2019s enjoyable and he\u2019s fondness for Guts is adorable in some sense. Two other major characters are introduced, Farnese and Serpico. Farnese is a character who is deeply delusional about her religion and finds herself in stuck between two choices. Serpico on the other hand is more of a man how takes things logically and uses hits wits over his strength during combat. Both characters are nice additions to an already great cast. \\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nWith its CGI animation, it is to be expected that the art will lack a great deal of detailing. Character models are what looks the worst as they\u2019re the ones that are animated using CGI. Outfits look fine, and Guts\u2019 armor looks pretty good, but the character faces looks bad. Due to the lack of detailing, character expressions look plain, unexpressive, and downright weird at times. And the anime using hatching as shading (lines) and it works well when in manga format, but it\u2019s distracting in anime format. The studio thought that hatching can add some volume to their bland character models, but unfortunately it looks worse. Most of the backgrounds are 2D instead of 3D and the contrast of quality is visible. Many of the backgrounds are quite pretty, especially the insides of buildings. The lighting is also quite good, but some shadows can look a little weird. Sometimes 2D art is used for characters for tiny moments to add a greater affect and these moments look quite good. If only the entire series had that art quality.\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nSome studios tend to use CGI to makes sequences looks smoother and more fluid, in sacrifice for art quality. The new Berserk anime sacrificed its art quality, while managing to make their CGI choppier than imaginable. The lack of smoothness isn\u2019t entirely bad during normal scenes, but during action-scenes (which is most of the series), it ends up being headache-inducing. But it\u2019s not just the choppiness that\u2019s the issue, but also the cinematography too. Too many zoom-ins make it hard to see what\u2019s actually going on and the camera movies to much during action sequences. There are \u201cstill-shot\u201d moments where only some things are animated, while somethings are not, and these moments can look quite distracting. For example, in episode 2\u2019s first fight, after Guts cuts down countless knights in one strike, many of the surviving knights looks at Guts in shock. During this moments, none of the knights are actually animated and are still and the same goes for Guts too, yet the wind is still blowing Guts\u2019 cape and it just looks really weird. Whenever the 2D moments happen, they aren\u2019t really animated much, except for their lips moving while they\u2019re talking and that\u2019s it. And the 2D backgrounds too can also look quite static. \\n\r\nAnimation: 3/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nMany of the seiyuu from the Golden Age movie trilogy lend their voices in this anime. Iwanaga Hiroaki returns back to voice Guts and he\u2019s just as good as he was in the movies. His voice is quite similar to Ono Daisuke\u2019s, but he can add the coarse feel of Guts. And he\u2019s able to make Guts sound super badass too! Yukinari Toa returns to voice Casca, and even though her character doesn\u2019t have much to speak, he does a good job in what she has to do. And Sakurai Takahiro (who seems to be everywhere recently) returns to do Griffith and does a great job\u2026 but too bad you\u2019ll only get to hear him say a couple of lines. Hikasa Yoko does a great job as the religious and somewhat weird Farnese and Okitsu Kazuyuki does a very good job as Serpico and his sarcastic tone works well with his character. Mizuhara Kaoru makes Puck sound exactly as I how imagined it to be and Shimono Hiro, though sounding too old for his character, does his best as Isidro. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe best thing about the previous Berserk adaptations were its music and this anime is no exception. As a matter of a fact, it\u2019s not farfetched to say that this adaptation has the best background music when compared to the previous adaptations. The OP, \u201cInferno\u201d, is pretty good and catchy and it matches with the new tone of Berserk. The lyrics in general are quite good. The ED, \u201cMeimoku no Kanata\u201d, is a great song with great vocals, but it doesn\u2019t completely suit Berserk and something else, something more depressing would\u2019ve been better. But the adaptation\u2019s biggest strength it its background music and insert songs. First of all, Hirasawa\u2019s new song for Berserk, \u201cHai Yo\u201d is fantastic. I personally believe that its better than \u201cSign\u201d and \u201cAria\u201d, and it\u2019s on the same caliber as \u201cForces\u201d. It\u2019s used quite a lot, but it never gets boring. Then we have Hirasawa\u2019s second insert song \u201cAsh Crow\u201d, which is only used once, but it\u2019s great and it works well (Note: Hirasawa\u2019s newly released album features the two insert songs, a really dope mix of \u201cForces\u201d and some other well-known Berserk songs. Be sure to check that out). A lot of the background music are remixes of the movie trilogy\u2019s OST. The \u201cBlood & Guts\u201d, \u201cMy Brother\u201d, and \u201cGriffith's Dream\u201d are fantastic and some of the techno music in the series only adds to action. \\n\r\nMusic: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nThis may have not been the adaptation people were hoping to see, but even with such a mediocre adaptation, quite a lot of enjoyment was found to be seen. Even though a mini-arc skipped, what was adapted was adapted well. Some messy directing and haphazard pacing ruins the experience. And the CGI animation quality looks pretty bad most of the time. Miura\u2019s original writing still shines through these issues and the music just makes things better. It\u2019s nice to have more of Hirasawa\u2019s music and those Golden Age OST remixes are great. And when the 2D style is used, it looks nice. But only in a perfect world many we ever get the Berserk adaptation we wished for. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this new Berserk adaptation is only recommended for those who can withstand the mediocre art and animations and inconsistent directing. As an adaptation of the Conviction arc, it was quite loyal despite its weird pacing and lack of proper transitioning between scenes. The new characters that are introduced are handled well and the voice acting is great too. And even if you get nothing out of this adaptation, you still have Hirasawa\u2019s godly insert songs and great Golden Age OST remixes to listen to while Guts cuts down countless men and supernatural creatures. And unlike most people, I can\u2019t wait to see the next arc adapted next spring!\\n\\n\r\n+ A loyal adaptation of the Conviction arc with no important moments being skipped.  \\n\r\n+ Both the returning and new characters are great and well-handled.  \\n\r\n+ Berserk\u2019s tone, style, and (new) comedic relief is handled well. \\n\r\n+ Great remixes of older Berserk OSTs and Hirasawa\u2019s two insert songs are fantastic. \\n\r\n- Amateurish directing at some points and inconsistent pacing ruins the experience\\n\r\n- Lackluster CGI animations, which feels even more jarring when contrasted with its 2D backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.3/10",

Very disappointed, especially because of the new music.\r\nBut the anime got better with every episode and already episode 2 brought me the Berserk feeling! The Anime is extremly close to the manga and the new music fits in perfectly with the scenes, at least after you get used to it. I love the new version of \"my brother\" and \"blood and guts\".\r\nIf you have seen the old anime, watched the new moviesor read the manga: Watch it!\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen any berserk before, watch the 3 movies first! The new series doesnt tell you a lot of what happened before and you really need the information to get the picture. Afterwards you are fine with watching this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhy did I give an Overall-Rating of 10 even though I gave only 8 to art and 9 to sound? Because it was an overall experience of 10. \\n",

            "content": "Before I begin, I would like to allow the readers some comfort in knowing that although I shall include my personal thoughts, I'll primarily be typing in an objective way of which will in fact differ with that of my thoughts at times. Also I'll not be lowering or raising my opinions on trivial matters such as the old series or the manga, as that is a comparison and not a proper judgement to this work as itself.\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\r\nAnd now, to dive right in I\u2019ll start with the story. For someone with no former knowledge of the series, it will most undoubtedly be confusing at times,especially for questions specifically regarding individual characters. Your first thoughts must be something along the lines of \u201cso you\u2019re telling me the plot / character development is slow if not bad, right?\u201d, however, you could look at it in a lighter sense where things are gradually being fleshed out for you rather than put on a platter since most questions will be answered at one point or another. And all those who\u2019ve Berserk knowledge already should find the pacing is fairly well as there isn\u2019t much for pointless content, most episodes seem fairly consistent in tossing a plethora of both action and plot progression. Though it is somewhat hasty, I personally find that any less would be too slow and any more would be too flashy. It seems to get straight toward the point. And so, for a solid and consistent story covering many things gradually while still keeping you wanting to find out more, personally I would like to give it a 9/10 but alas I have to say 8/10. I talk a little about where the first episode started in the final paragraph.\\n\r\nSTORY 8/10\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nThe part most people probably are curious to see as it is under such heavy debate, the artwork. Now, I\u2019m just going to say that having an anime made in CG isn\u2019t on its own a bad thing, but it really depends on the specific series. There are some where they just look terrible, and yet others use CG effectively such as Berserk 2016. Even if you are one of those who dislike CG, for the potential of CG all in all it at least is better than other works. Personally I find this series to be better with CG but for a few reasons, such as: The medieval theme really pushes the use of CG compared to other themes because the scenery/weapons/armors/etc. all have a more serious look and feel to them, imo at least. Another thing is that the manga is drawn inexpressively well, and although this art style lacks the immaculate detail the manga has, it still yields very crisp lines, smooth motion which is most prominent in gracious looking battle sequences, vibrant colors especially during effects. Now, you may disagree with my opinion and points all you want but at least have a valid reason to prefer 2D over 3D art styles other than the repeated \u201cIt has no detail\u201d or \u201cIt looks absolutely ugly\u201d because trust me, there are probably hundreds of shows that look worse. I won\u2019t only compliment it though, there are moments where it doesn\u2019t quite look right and the most noticeable con to this is some of the characters faces. Do note also, that there are times throughout this series where they immerse themselves between 2D and 3D to emphasize certain moments. I personally have no reason to dislike an art style so I would probably have rated it higher, but I understand some people cannot simply sit for that, and that is perfectly fine.\\n\r\nART STYLE 7/10\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nThe audio in this season is absolutely fantastic, and that\u2019s coming from a soundtrack enthusiast. The music tracks are all fairly epic and usually play out at the perfect times, such as the suspenseful tunes when things get dangerous, can really send a chill down your back. Or the amazing \u201cHai yo\u201d track used during battles or important events really gets the fire burning and pulls you into the moment.\\n\r\nThe sound effects are phenomenal as well, with each swing of a weapon, foot step, movements, etc. all have sounds and they are indeed a welcome piece to the show. They at times sound out of place but I\u2019d say they generally have spot on sounds, and so I cannot complain. \\n\r\nThe voice acting is very sound too, they did a good job for their parts and really added that Berserk feel if you know what I mean. The voices actually make sense and sound as they should, when situations are raised and tension increases the voices do not falter.\\n\r\nPersonally, I find that the sounds/music can make or break a scene in an anime, and so if you are like that I think it will be a great watch for you during those moments.\\n\r\nSOUND 9/10\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nThe characters are fantastic but as the story would have it, in this season we aren\u2019t gifted with much if any back story or in depth character development. Sure we know a few things but we aren\u2019t given too much information, this applies to basically all characters. It simplifies these characters quite a lot, which some may prefer and others may find offense toward. For Guts his action scenes are a spectacle and his attitude adds to the moments quite nicely. I find his character to be enjoyable and giving you the sense of wanting more. The other characters are fleshed out in certain scenes which is a relief, and it helps to show that though they\u2019re simplified, you can still get a feel for some of them. For those old time Berserk fans, the dialogue might be off throughout the episodes but it should still be somewhat good to say the least. And though you may be used to more in depth character plot and development from the franchise, if you dislike that aspect it is fully understandable. Change isn\u2019t always something people want.\\n\r\nCHARACTER 9/10\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nNow, I\u2019m not the kind of person to give a perfect score but in this case a 10 for enjoyment means it had an effect or impression left upon me. Granted you might not enjoy it or you may but with different opinions to that of my own, but either way I hope these words managed to help you decide whether or not it\u2019s something for you. Personally, I very much so enjoyed this series and I hope the same can apply to you all.\\n\r\nP.S \u2013 For those who just  think it is bad because there is CG, and or only think the good looking moments are the 2D scenes, let me just ask you this: \u201cAre you really serving justice to the franchise your fandom is so loyal toward? Sure it isn\u2019t 2D, but it can\u2019t look wholly bad can it?\u201d Just one more thing too, for those disappointed on where episode 1 starts, since the second season is going to air in 2017 according to the end of episode 12, sure it doesn\u2019t transition very well but it still picked a starting point to carry on from. The moment a new series aired so many years later, you shouldn\u2019t have expected it to transition nicely or you were really just setting yourself up for disappointment. People would hope for it but you would still know it\u2019s probably unlikely. This section isn\u2019t a rant, just my final attempt to hopefully make long time Berserk fans enjoy this series a little more rather than being upset, after all it\u2019s been ages since new TV content, we shouldn\u2019t accept what we don\u2019t like but at least see it out to the end.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 10/10\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nThank you, and if anyone took offense to this than I apologise. \\n\r\nOVERALL 8.6/10 so rounded up to -> 9/10\\n",

            "content": "\"That anime was too bad to be called Berserk. Too rough, too crappy, too cgi and far too choppy. It was more like a large piece of shit.\"\r\nSo, the new adaptation of Berserk is finally here, everyone was excited, and even if the pv's already were pretty bad and we knew it was going to look ugly, atleast we could expect the story to be presented and the anime to be enjoyable. Was that the case? Oh boy....\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe promise here was that we would finally see the Black Swordsman arc animated, finally the story would move on from the Golden Age. Instead what weget was a 1st episode that managed to skip 6 volumes from the manga, both Black Swordsman and Lost Children arcs, and moved right into the Conviction arc and even then, they rushed it like hell to fit the arc in 12 episodes. This, apart from not being what was promised, was done in a terrible way. Someone that has only seen the 1997 anime and expects this to be a direct continuation, which it should have been, will be completely lost. They do a terrible job of mixing things from the arcs they skiped, and give no form of conection to the former series so viewers not familiar with the manga can follow. It is safe to say this adaptation is a flop.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2\\n\r\nCgi in a budget tv series will never look good, and it looks even worse when it's done by people who have no experience in it. The characters look dull and lifeless, the movement looks janky, backgrounds are terrible and everything just feels like no effort was put into it. Another big problem here is the overall direction of the shots, always jumping from scene to scene like some kid with ADHD together with a terrible use of camera movement makes percieving what is happening in moments with alot of action almost impossible. The amount of zoom in's used is so often that at some points it feels like the characters will hit pop out of the screen or something. I think the biggest problem here was with the director which his bigger works are a sports/comedy short series with frantic animation and camera movements. It might work for something like that, it does not work with a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nI liked the voice acting in this show, in some characters it doesn't fit, but for the most part i think they are fine. Some of the music are good, mostly tracks they used from the movie trilogy and a great track from Susumu Hirasawa. However the rest of the bgm used is very forgetable and generic. The issue here is how they were used, jumping from scene to scene, ending abruptly and sometimes not fitting the moment they are placed, this again a problem from the way the director did things. Opening and ending themes were alright, i don't think they fit but they weren't terrible. My biggest problem was the sound effects, they ranged from bad to worse and the biggest offender was the memetastic CLANG you hear everytime Guts hits something with this sword. And yes the sound is always the same, no matter what is being hit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nWell then when you cut so much from the story, you are obviously cutting character development as well. The biggest offender of this is the relation between Guts and Puck. It feels unnatural and forced how they in one episode don't get along and in the next they are best buds. Overral, some characters do behave how they should, but with the skiping and rushing of content it doesn't feel natural.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this one bit, being a huge fan of the manga this felt like a bad joke. What really makes me pissed is that this kills any potential for a good adaptation in the future, well atleast until the manga finishes and who know when that day will come.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nIt's bad, there is no other way to put it. It's an insult to the source material, and it baffles me how something as big and well renowned as Berserk can't get a good project from some talented team who really cares about it. Well, then again Miura also doesn't care too much about an anime adaptation, as long as he puts his all to make the manga the best he can and Idolmaster exists he is chillin.\\n\\n\r\nPeople died in the 19 years waiting for a new anime and this is what we got.",

            "content": "Not only a bad adaptation of Berserk, but a horrible anime overall. Can only recommend this piece of shit to people without taste, they seem to like it.\r\n     Story - 4\\10. And those 4 points exist only because i'ts an adaptation of Kentaro Miura's Magnum Opus and has some ok'ish points. But's it's so butchered - it's impossible to give it even one more point. ALL character development was cut in favour of 360 MEGA SUPER PRO ACTION, which i will talk later.\r\n    Art - 1\\10. It's so pathetic i don't know, if i want to talk aboutit. Neither the director, nor the animtors themselves know, what the hell they were doing. It seems, like they just looked up word \"art\" and \"action\" on wikipedia and tried to make a show out of that. Needless to say - they failed to deliver. Absolutelly horrendous animation, unbearable 3d models of literally everything and shitty shadows do it's best to make you puke. \\n\r\n  Oh, and i forgot about the \"best\" part - every damn fight (which is about 90% of this adaptation) is 360 NOSCOPE shot from the blade of Gut's sword Dragonslayer. + terrible montage makes it impossible to even witness those fights. They are literally cut out for faster pacing. For example: A guy throws a large stone on the group of heroes. It would be safe to assume, that we'll be shown, how they avoid it. ANd in this show they simply skip next 5 seconds to the point, where said stone destroyed a wall. It feels like someone developed King Crimson for \"reasons\".\\n\\n\r\n    Sound - 4\\10. Just like with the story, those 4 points only exist because of a treasure, that is Susumu Hirasawa. And imagine what? They destroyed even his music with this terrible show. Don't get me wrong, his ONLY song, which plays in almost every fight scene in great, but it just doesn't fit in with marionettes efortless fights. Like i mentioned, Hirasawa only made one track for this new anime, and oh boy the studio loved it. A bit too much, to say the least. They used it everywhere they could, and where they couldn't - they used their own shitty metal, which desn't seem to fit either. \\n\r\n  Every damn scene in this abomination has some sort of a theme. There are literally no quiet moments, no suspence, no thrill. It's just afraid of being \"empty\", being a full trashcan in result.\\n\r\nAnd don't forget *CLANG* of Dragonslayer. It cut's metal - CLANG, people - CLANG, monsters - CLANG, ghosts - CLANG and so on. It's the only noise it makes. Why? Is it really THAT hard to record any other suound?\\n\\n\r\n    Character - 3/10. Like i said in the \"Story\" part - there is no character development. They skipped all of them just to get more of that \"action\".\\n\r\n  Hell, i can't enjoy Gut's being badass, because his 3d-model looks like a fucking banana. And there is no reason for him doing, what he does. Why does he want to save Casca? \"WHO CARES? LET'S GET MORE 360-SHOTS!\" Why does he reject religion in any way, makes fun of it? \"BLAH-BLAH-BLAH!\"\\n\\n\r\n    Enjoyment - 1\\10. Do i really need to say why it's so low? So yeah, i was about to rear my hair and rip my own eyes out.\\n\\n\r\n    Overall - 2\\10. You can say, that even with such horrendous art and butchered story it should be like 1-2 points higher. Perhaps, but i don't want to encourage makers of this shit any more, than i should. I don't know how things really are, but i think the director was the biggest reason it sucks so much. There is no sence of direction, over 12 episodes you have no idea, where this is going and why. They tried their hardest to fail. They REALLLY tried to fail and on that - it delivers. GOOD JOB ON FUCKING THINGS UP!\\n\\n\r\n   I am sorry for my harsh language and kind of avarage english. I hope you understood, what i tried to say and why i said, what i did. Please don't give this piece of shit any praise just because it's an adaptaion of Berserk. By this you are just spitting on potential quality.",

            "content": "Presentation/Animation 0/10: I'm glad that I label this as \"Presentation/Animation\" rather than Art & Animation be because to even label this as art is derogatory to everything else I've ever experienced. Labeling this as art would be a farce of which the world has never seen. The animation and \"\"art\"\" in this show is extremely overrated. Myriad [there's that word again] addresses to the \"animation\" in this include \"Berserk isn't about the look\", \"It's not that bad\". \"I prefer it over the 1997 version\", and other garbage not worth mentioning. This is so poor it's honestly a deconstruction and subversion of what makes literally anythingnot terrible. Merely watching this is like wanting to sneeze for 20 minutes, getting a tissue, and finding out the tissue you grabbed was actually a heavily used, AIDS infected washcloth from Somalia. Anyway, let's deconstruct and subvert YOUR (yes, you, the reader)'s expectations on the previous 3 \"arguments\". Half of the appeal of Berserk is undeniably the look. It is that bad, and if you don't think this you've traumatized yourself and fooled yourself into thinking it's \"not that bad\". The 1997 looks far better than this, period. I'm not bothering to explain this to the same mongrels that spam this stupid \"limited animation\" MEME.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Characters 0.5/10: Gee, maybe if the presentation/animation wasn't so bad the characters could actually emote their ugly pointy chin faces. But hey, at least they adapted all the new arcs, except for you know, the very first one, The Black Swordsman, which after THREE adaptations has still not been animated. Or the Conviction arc immediately following the Golden Age which leads directly into the next arc, which now makes no sense. \\n\\n\r\nMyriad Defenses 0/10: Why do people even think this is watchable, let alone good? The worst part of this is the people that claim to watch this for the story which now makes basically no sense with all the arc skipping and rigid character moments.  Oh, and the soundtracks are god-awful. I literally turned down the volume every time that screeching Korean pop-rock opening played. They even had the nerve to spam that music during the show, as if it was supposed to make a scene EPIC and COOL. It kind of makes me sad this show and the second season is rated so highly.",

            "content": "After many years we've got a sequel to the great Berserk, this time about Guts as the Black Swordsman, which we've only had a glimpse in the first and last episode of the first anime.\r\nLots of people are angry with the 3D cell shading animation, but I don't see it as a problem, it as a dark feel to it, which goes well with the themes of the story. The things we can point as negative is that it's a different kind of \r\nanimation from the original, but that one as been released 20 years ago. \r\nIt also as a low frame rate, which makesthings less fluid.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the character design, Guts and the rest of the Taka no Dan are as they\\n\r\nshould be, slightly older, we can't forget that this one takes place a couple \\n\r\nof years after the original. Griffith design however seems to different unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nEnough talking about the controversial visual part, let's get to the part that most matters, the story.\\n\\n\r\nGuts is in his search for his beloved Casca and for the Apostles, which will lead him to a land where the church as lots of influence. Casca as lost her mind in the depths of hell, the same time Guts as been marked to be chasen by demons for the rest of his life.\\n\\n\r\nThe story that follows will have several interesting subjects, the Inquisition, thrust an betrayal, the doubts of the Church Knights' Captain about religion and her inner sado-masochist side. We also have lots of violence, due to Guts' fights with the soldiers and the demons and the tortures of the inquisition.\\n\\n\r\nIsidoro and a group of hookers, whose leader Luca have been taking care of Casca, also make their appearance and will accompany Guts, bringing a few interesting stories with them. There is also Puck... a fairy that tries to bring a bit of comedy, it's a meaningless addition.\\n\\n\r\nSo we get a interesting story, but it's pace it's kind of slow, we could get it all compressed to 4 or 5 episodes without losing much, as it loses a bit of time setting the mood and with some of the hookers side stories.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's worth watching, but is not as good a the 1997 one, without Griffith and all those conspiracies for power and amazing battles between armies, it couldn't be the same thing. \\n\r\nAlthough it ends with a bang, what might make things more interesting next season.\\n\\n\r\nI give a 7, while the 1997 I gave a 9.",

            "content": "This series just doesn\u2019t get Berserk.  If you were looking for something similar to the 1997 anime,  the movie trilogy or God forbid the manga,  either drop those expectations coming into this or turn around now.   At this point I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m angry,  I just can\u2019t be anymore.   Being frustrated over a show isn\u2019t worth anyone\u2019s time.   If you wanted the short answer that was it, but if you\u2019re willing to keep reading bear with me- It is definitely a bit of a long one.\r\n  Berserk 2016 may very wellbe one of the most disappointing and painful experiences of my life.    I\u2019m not joking.   As a Berserk fan I have never been more ashamed.   I know a lot of people will defend Berserk simply of name alone, but I would be hard pressed to talk about this series in a positive manner just because its Berserk.   After years of people wanting a new Berserk adaptation and so much support for the franchise growing in recent years, you would think this series would be an instant classic.  Anime of the year.  A legend.  So what the hell happened?\\n\\n\r\n  Berserk 2016  fails in literally every category when it comes to production quality.  Animation, music, sound, story---- you name it and it fails miserably.   How something this amateurish and unappealing even  managed to get approved is actually quite mind boggling.    For those who still don\u2019t know by now,  this anime acts as a sort of pseudo-sequel series to each version of the Golden Age arc.   If you\u2019ve watched or read as far as the Golden Age arc into any of the other previous material for Berserk,  that\u2019s all you are expected to know.   If you\u2019ve never experienced the Golden Age arc, STAY AWAY from this series period.  Not only is this the worst possible introduction to Berserk,  but it actually spoils the events of the entire Golden Age arc in its intro ( and in a rather tasteless fashion I might add).\\n\\n\r\n  The story has not only been butchered, but it isn\u2019t even a slightly decent good time on its own.  For those that don\u2019t already know, but want to continue reading anyway the story loosely follows the events occurring after Guts becomes the Black Swordsman and his journey to seeking revenge against the man who left Guts' and his friends for dead.   With everything taken from him, Guts primary focus and center of attention becomes the protection of his now mentally broken girlfriend/ lover Casca.   Guts faces demons, both literally and figuratively. With the rise of a mysterious religious power in Midland on a witch hunt,  he\u2019ll have to track down the girl he left in the care of his remaining friends during his absence.\\n\\n\r\n  I won\u2019t go into too much detail about the actual structure of the series just know that several chapters of the manga have been edited and condensed to where there are several lingering questions and  many plot holes.  It tries to get back on track towards the middle half of the series,  but even if you\u2019ve never read the manga, the absolute rapid pace to which things are presented to you is likely to throw you off.   From the filler episode 3, mentions of a certain bad ass armor, the green behelit, Schierke making an appearance at the beginning and end of the series,  there definitely feels like there were better choices for content removal or editing.  Things that just aren\u2019t relevant to this arc, honestly could have just been removed if they simply just wanted to condense it.  The other adaptions of Berserk always made sure to at the very least keep in the most important aspects,but Berserk 2016 falls apart in the first episode,  combining about 4 to 5 volumes of material.  It seems as though the staff really didn\u2019t pick and choose wisely what should and should not have been included.\\n\\n\r\n  The  \u201cART\u201d  is a putrid blend of 3d and 2d animation,  I would be forgiving on HOW it looks, but how the series is actually animated is terrible.  In Berserk 2016, character movements are stiff and unnatural, color contrast are also absolutely ridiculous, there is often far too many shades of purple or blue where they don\u2019t belong.   With some scenes being either way too dark or way too bright.  ( For example episode 1 and 2 respectively) Either you can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going on most of the time or you\u2019re distracted by the day time sections of the series having little going on as far as atmosphere and background design.\\n\\n\r\n   To add to the choppy unrefined animation and art style,  the studio for some reason thought it would be cool if they added in random pan sweep shots to make things look cooler than they actually do.  My problem with this is you can\u2019t often clearly tell what is actually going on,  which is a problem that even many scenes in the Berserk animated films had. This factor applies to both the 3d and 2d sections of the series,  the 3d having way to much close up action during fight scenes and the 2d scenes having so much shit flying by at once you can\u2019t even discern what hell you just saw.   The strange, serene moments that Berserk has always had are thrown out the window so the series can constantly be in your face the entire time.\\n\\n\r\n   There is a lack of impact in everything done in the series.  Not only can the series not capture the beautiful  and awkward moments that Berserk can have,  but it can\u2019t even do impact correctly.  The Dragon Slayer is a prime victim of this.  Every episode I feel like I\u2019m watching a slow moving marble knock over a stack of dominos.   It doesn\u2019t have a presence and honestly it just isn\u2019t shown off well enough.   It\u2019s all just very dull and not very interesting to look at for 12 episodes straight.   Guts himself lacks presence overall not seeming all that bad ass and for a lot of moments, pretty weak for a guy that hunts demons for a living.  That aside, the timing is also very strange with each kill being fairly overblown and every \u201csex\u201d scene portrayed as awkwardly... sensual and almost fan-servicy to be quite honest with you. \"Fan-servicy\"  is NEVER a feeling I should get from Berserk.\\n\\n\r\n   Now horrible design choices and color contrast aside, the sound and music is absolutely atrocious.   The sound is just overall bad, you will find no calm and beauty like the theme of Guts or the sheer inspiration of songs like Forces here, just forgettable metal songs and as far as the sound effects it doesn\u2019t fare much better.  The Dragon Slayer\u2019s sound tends to be also pretty bad in the sound effects  department. For most of the series it sounds like a log being drowned under water and other sounds come out equally as muffled or flat.  The Dragon Slayer is supposed to be intimidating and powerful, yet it feels like there is simply no satisfaction to be had from any of Guts\u2019 kills.  A series where taking down larger than life demons is supposed to be gratifying shouldn\u2019t be this much of a bore to watch.  Everything feels all wrong, like this wasn\u2019t even made for Berserk fans and it just shouldn\u2019t be that way.\\n\\n\r\n  To summarize it best I guess.  Giving Berserk to a no name studio, with a track record of all zero notable titles was a red flag from the start.   This series was a mistake.  Why a studio like Madhouse,  which could have captured the franchises dark tone and storytelling or Gainax,  which specializes in the intense and psychological,  were NOT considered for this adaption is  beyond me.    This could have easily been a well-made 60+ episode anime adaption.    Instead of going the FMA Brotherhood or Hellsing Ultimate route and giving the fans and newcomers a satisfying, thrilling experience------we are left with this. \u2026. A series that won\u2019t hold up and will likely be forgotten over time, but still disappointed all the same.\\n",

            "content": "The Internet Hate Train has arrived. ALL ABOARD! WOO WOO!!!!\r\nI put off watching this series for a while because all I had heard was extremely negative! Then my inner contrarian was awakened and I reasoned that the internet anime community also hates a lot of series that I love. Maybe this series isn't so bad? WRONG! I swear this series was produced by the Rapehorse himself!\r\nBackground:\r\nThe internet anime community only has a couple \"sacred cows\" where you will get flamed to a crisp if you dare say a negative word about them. One is Legend of the Galactic Heroes and the other is the Berserkmanga. Many corners of the internet regard it above Watchmen as the greatest graphic novel of all time. 4chan loves Berserk so much that even badmouthing the manga on /pol/ would make people go \"WOAH...too far dude! Freedom of speech has limits!\" Yet despite the slavish devotion Berserk has online, Japanese producers have always been skeptical and thus rather tight with their money. The original Berserk anime had recycled animation and non-animated splash pages to a degree that was occasionally comical. The soundtrack replayed the same songs over and over. Cool portions of the manga had to be cut out. Yet it was still regarded as a classic and rightfully so. Berserk 2016 on the other hand is outright, indefensible GARBAGE!\\n\\n\r\nPlot and characters:\\n\\n\r\nBerserk 2016 already had a difficult task because the Black Swordsman Arc is... honestly the worst point in the entire manga. It has glimmers of brilliance, but is weighed down by Miura trying to be so dark and edgy it becomes unintentionally hilarious. Examples of this include the infamous rapehorse and a nun warrior burning innocent people alive while fingerblasting herself. The dialogue includes such over the top classics as \"Miracles make me wanna PUKE!\" Caska comes down with classic soap opera amnesia. Adapting this portion of the manga was always going to be hard, but Berserk 2016 flat out eviscerates Miura's work. \\n\\n\r\nRemember the creepy yet emotionally powerful Rosina Arc that helps introduce us to the new Post-Eclipse Guts? Gone. They cut out the whole thing and gave us some schmuck apostle with no backstory that we have ZERO reason to care about. Remember how morally disgusting Farnese was at first and how big a deal it was that she gradually became good and turned face? The anime version of Farnese blushes at the site of blood and has never killed anyone. Her sadism is implied briefly, but NOTHING like how she was in the manga. The best portion of the entire Black Swordsmen Arc is Miura's impressive ability to actually get the reader to forgive Farnese and want to root for her. The anime fucking ruined it! Characters are watered down, crucial backstory is cut out, and important arcs are entirely skipped. Most baffling of all is that the gore is cut way down from the movies and even the nipples are censored, let alone privates. This is fucking BERSERK! You can cut down some of the pointless squick nudity like the bathhouse chapters with Farnese and Caska. I would actually thank the anime for sparing us the cringe of Schierke\u2019s loli ass shots. However, you can\u2019t simply cut all blood and nudity of Berserk. It is too iconic and integral to the gritty feel of the story. It is true using too much blood and nudity can lead to backlash and unintentional comedy. Look no farther than the internet\u2019s favorite punching bag Elfen Lied. However, going the opposite direction and making a PG-13 Berserk actually robs Berserk of the shock and awe edge that helped Berserk stand out and win over casual fans in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nHOLY SHIT is the art awful in this series! It uses cell shading CG like Valkyria Chronicles on the early PS3 only the character art is shit and the animation is about 5 frames per second. This means the characters move clunky and unnatural like this was filmed in fucking stop motion. When the skeletons attack it looks exactly like a scene from \u201cJason and the Argonauts\u201d or \u201cArmy of Darkness\u201d. The art in the 2nd and 3rd movies greatly improved from the 1st movie, but the series looks WAY worse than the 1st movie! This art is so bad it simply has to be seen to be believed!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nRemember how the original Berserk had \u201cForces\u201d and \u201cBehelit\u201d and other memorable tracks? This soundtrack has none of that! Not to mention the voice actors are almost all amateurs because the producer clearly doesn\u2019t give a shit about this project. The worst of all though is the fucking STUPID sound that occurs every time Guts swings his sword. They go with this metallic BOOONG sound that viewers have described as an empty oil drum being hit with a hammer. This same sound happens no matter what Guts hits with the sword and turns what should be serious scenes into comedy gold. They basically turned Guts into El Kabong! Berserk shouldn\u2019t be making me think of Hanna Barbara cartoons from the 1950s!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\n1 episode of Berserk 2016: This is SHIT, maybe it will get better?\\n\r\n2 episodes of Berserk 2016: I think I\u2019m beginning to lose my sanity!\\n\r\n3 episodes of Berserk 2016: I hear it's amazing when the famous purple stuffed worm in flap-jaw space with the tuning fork does a raw blink on Hara-Kiri Rock. I need scissors! 61! \\n\r\n4 episodes of Berserk 2016: DELETE! DELETE! DELETE! DELETE!",

            "content": "It truly saddens me that this new adaptation of Berserk we receive after patiently waiting for almost two decades had to turn out like it did. This is a far cry from what the older adaptation managed to achieve and is regarded as a timeless classic, then again the previous anime was working with arguably the best source material out there with that being the 'Golden Age' arc. The decline in quality was to be expected as Berserk certainly peaked during the conclusion of that arc with the events of the Eclipse. The problem with this current adaptation was the fact that the script writerswere adamant about fully adapting the Conviction arc but at the expense of rushing the Black Swordsman arc and completely omitting the Lost Children side story arc. The latter is understandable due to the censorship that modern anime are subject to and so with current regulations it was an uncertainty from the beginning it was announced. \\n\\n\r\nThis adaptation focuses on Guts trying to locate and eventually rescue Casca who has very much turned into an invalid after the traumatic events of the Eclipse. This is mainly due to the negligence of Rickert who as a former Band of the Hawk member was concerned with the mental state of Caska who was under his protection the whole time. This responsibility is ultimately Guts' one in the end but would make his main objective seemingly more difficult. Learning about the details of Caska's movements, Guts along with a new companion named Isidro who is obsessed with him and aspires to emulate his heroics find themselves in the desolate refugee camp called Albion. This is where the tower of 'Conviction' run by the Holy Iron Chain Knights is located and where the main events takes place.\\n\\n\r\nApparently the damage was already done when the fans of Berserk realised that the first few episodes did not cater to their expectations. Let's be real here, anyone here knowing Berserk's relationship with CG animation should have had the mindset of wanting an average/decent adaptation, only to get a big f*ck you when butchering the source material. If you are reading this then you are a brave soul indeed after experiencing this abomination that may have scarred you permanently. The verdict of most fans by now will probably be dismissing the show and refusing to acknowledge its existence. \\n\\n\r\nThe series barely manages to retain the authenticity of the manga with it being a decent portrayal of a dark fantasy series. It still possesses that gritty, inhumane atmosphere that is commonly associated with Berserk. It could even pass off as a post-apocalyptic setting due to the state of events within Albion where poverty and desperation is strife due to an outbreak of the plague in certain cities in the Midlands leading to an influx of refugees seeking help. Religion is the main theme for this arc as it is seen as the way forward when experiencing hard times - basically the only means of salvation for these commoners who would do anything to survive. This is evident in the numerous amounts of individuals being put to death after being accused of being heretics hence is linked to the tower of 'Conviction', where all sorts of horrific torture and other forms of extreme brutality taking place in the name of religion.\\n\\n\r\nThe hate for the animation techniques used in this anime is probably the single reason why many dropped the show. I abhor the use of 3D and 2D animation ever mixing and to me are like oil and water when done in a mediocre fashion. The ratio between the two is the most disturbing factor personally, as I'm actually impressed by the hand drawn animations which are sparse and are used occasionally as a means of conveying certain facial expressions such as Guts purely concentrating for the kill. This is short lived though as we are expected to put up with the unsightly 3D which infuriates me.\\n\\n\r\n3D models of the characters make up the majority of the animation but are heavily altered with shadings being applied to everyone and the rest of the designs being drawn over by the animators. If there is a positive from this show (though not many) the character designs are consistent but is not always the case as there are times when normal animation is used randomly in certain scenes such as the girls from Luca's group.\\n\\n\r\nThe more episodes you watch, you gradually become more accustomed to the CG which would be case for those who managed to stay on. There is no smooth movement from the animation as it can look jerky at times mainly through different shot compositions such as close ups and its use in the background. The last thing that needs mentioning was the opening had good animation but that is just pure deception compared to what actually takes place.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is one aspect that probably goes unscathed in my review as the voice actors did a reasonable job at performing their characters. Characters such as Farnese and Mozgus sound just like I had imagined them when reading the manga which was unexpected. The soundtrack is a slight disappointment as it can't compare to the greatness of Susumu Hirasawa's one for the original series. This series just has one theme that I find worthwhile whereas the other has plenty to offer in comparison despite it being half an hour long. The background sound use is adequately used in most cases except for Guts and his use of his broadsword which can come off as being similar to striking a metal bannister when obliterating his enemies.\\n\\n\r\nI was very much hyped about Berserk getting an adaptation because everyone hates cliffhangers after the 1997 Berserk finale. I wouldn't even call this a direct sequel as it assumes you have prior knowledge of the manga when watching and for an anime-only would be difficult to follow. This show is not worth your time and so like they say, avoid it like the plague.\\n",

            "content": "Lets discuss things that aren't the animation, which is terrible, but everyone's already said that. Whats more offensive is their handling of the actual material. Even at the ten episode mark, the show has already taken extreme liberties with the stories it does include, and it skips the Lost Children arc entirely. What remains has been butchered beyond recognition, as they rework, reorganize, and repurpose to try and condense volumes of content into handfuls of episodes. Its fair to say that things what work in manga form don't always work in an anime, and therefore to rework some content is not only permissible, but insome cases it can be commendable. This, however, is just a hackjob, rushed in an attempt to cash in on the micro-hype generated by the films from a couple of years ago. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the sound design is atrocious. Gut's sword sounds like it's hollow, and makes the exact same *KWANG* sound for 90% of the things it collides with. I would not be surprised if there were a dozen stock effects total that they just layered on as approximations. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. The greatest tragedy is the OP, which is beautiful. It's 2D, it's well animated, and even the song is catchy. However, you then go from that, to the 3D abomination of the show. It's like a minute-long tease that shows you what could've been and then asks you to sit through what you actually got. \\n\\n\r\nI do not know why they got a studio known for it's romances and slice-of-life series, but they've fundamentally asked Anne Rice to direct Clint Eastwood. \\n\\n\r\n0/10, \"-the manga was better.\"",

            "content": "Berserk returns with a whimper than a roar! The return of Guts and his tale feels like a horribly put together fan project.\r\nStory 4/10\r\nBerserk initially had many fans, myself included, anticipating its return. In this installment of the once great franchise the story and plot lacked the intensity & excitement the original series presented. This series was supposed to follow the manga according to what is on file in the MAL/ANN database. For the most part, it didn't follow the original source as much and sort of pulled random things out its ass to improvise. I found this to be both unprofessional and lazy onthe director\u2019s end. Of the many, one of the most disappointing things about the story is its overall presentation. It comes off ass.. (He he, I wrote ass) as, lazy. \\n\\n\r\nIt appeared as if Berserk was only made just to cash in on the franchise some more. The story is painfully weak in terms of plot & narrative. The beginning and middle, rising action, parts of the story were perhaps the biggest turn off.  The amount of action, gore and death in the story felt limited. This ruined a majority of my experience with the beginning and conclusion of the story. I strongly believe that the writing could have been much better. \\n\r\nFew moments into the introduction, the first episode pretty much plays homage to the original anime series. Guts arrive at bar or brothel saves a woman, etc. Except, now in the 2016 version Guts saves a woman, befriends a possibly homo-sexual fairy, who doesn't shout \"Hey, Listen\" and the two become buddies. I don't remember the time it takes for all of these events to happen, however I believe it was about 10 minutes into the show that I wanted to drop it simply because of that. The stories appeal is bad enough to make even people who haven't seen the show turn away from it. Lastly, the main story gets even worse when it gets taken over by an awful intrusive sub-plot that focuses more on some of the most uninteresting characters in the series. This isn't so much the case in the manga however, I digress.   \\n\\n\r\nTowards the middle of the series, during maybe episode 6-9 (69.. ha ha children, see I have sex jokes) the story focuses less on Guts and his goal to save or abduct his mentally disable, brown sugar skinned goddess. Instead the story decides to focus more on the supporting and non-supporting characters. This wouldn't be so bad if only the characters were not so annoying, troublesome rather. For example when the prostitutes arrive, and Elaine is first show, at this point in the story is where I felt things became horrible. . The settings that the story took place in were not as visually horrifying nor did they set the tone for any new developments. The narrative, or rather, the way that the story was told, it failed improve successful elements that the original story used. \\n\r\nThe unfortunate thing is that although the story is somewhat part of the original work, the way that its' been directed so far, makes Berserk feel like a horribly put together fan project. Shallow story, coupled with bad action scenes, animation and horrible dialogue made me cringe.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKentaro Miura should be ashamed for agreeing his work to be animated in CGI poorly. His Penmanship, his detail in the original work is God-Like! (No exaggerations needed.) The Golden Age Arc of the series looks like perfection compared to this ugly, unappealing and awful, simply awful visuals. Details, there was a lack of the detailed gore like dismembered bodies and such for berserk. The dark settings and somber tone berserk once had seemed to have vanished. For some strange reason, berserk, the settings seemed to have taken a JRPG style setting. Woods, forest, deserted battle fields etc. Detailed animation on these settings was very minimal and unfortunately took away a lot of the enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nIn all honest though, the type of CGI, the art style is what ruined this once great series for me. I felt that I focused too much on how bad the art was that it completely turned me away from the story. It needed more work, it needed to feel more realistic not forced! Or over the type.. Or \"Edgy\" as the hip people say.\\n\r\nCGI, CGI, I still feel like CGI based anime is still a work in development. I would not be surprised if Berserk was used for this very reason and we were all the test audiences. If this is the case I do fear what else animation studios are planning to redo or \"re-master\" in full on CGI. I digress, using CGI over the traditional style that made berserk such an amazing series that is what hurt the series the most for me. There was simply no enjoyment, nothing to saw \"wow what amazing settings or detail, and I feel that it was the CGI to blame for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was on and off. Sometimes I felt that a majority of the actors were over-exaggerating when it came to screaming. When there were serious moments in the dialogue, I wasn\u2019t convinced that events were as bad as the characters said they were. The soundtrack wasn\u2019t impressive for the show.  Fight scenes were not nearly as intense because of the music. \\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI was not impressed with any of the characters. Lack of character development and bland personalities is what kept me from making any sort of connection. As mentioned earlier everyone was riddled with problems and awful traits.\\n\\n\r\nThe show didn't seem like it was ready for release. It's sort of like a video game... which ironically there is a game coming out. There were so many problems with it that it needs patches to fix them. I felt like what was released, wasn't the shows full potential. It almost feels rushed. Perhaps they didn't have any editors to look over it before release. I don't know what they were thinking when releasing this. However, it totally could use work on the story, animation, and settings. Maybe a dialogue that isn't so stale a cat wouldn't even eat it. Overall, I simply was not impressed with Berserk 2016. \\n",

            "content": "Berserk is one of the most beloved manga series of all time, with a successful anime in the nineties that covered the famed \u201cgolden age\u201d arc. But the manga is so much more than that arc, so when a series of movies were announced, fans were rightfully disappointed that it was a retelling of the same arc. Well, come 2016 and we\u2019re finally out of the golden age, with an anime promising to show us Guts as the \u201cBlack Swordsman,\u201d but can it do justice to the legendary manga it spawned from? Let\u2019s find out!\r\nWhen adapting a long, dark fantasy manga with highly detailed art,what studio would you think to pick for the anime? Madhouse, famous for the stunning visuals of Claymore or Overlord? Bones, with their amazing talents for action like the 2003 Fullmetal Alchemist and Kurau: Phantom Memory? Perhaps a-1 pictures, known for Sword Art Online, or maybe Deen, creators of widely acclaimed anime series Fate/Stay Night?\\n\\n\r\nNo, none of these studios can handle such a complex, detailed narrative, nor can they even hope to live up to the chaotic scenes of battle from the manga. And of course, none could possibly live up to the incredible artwork present in the manga. No, there\u2019s only one studio clearly cut out to do this job: Studio Millepensee.\\n\\n\r\nWith their work on teekyuu they\u2019ve shown they can tell complex, long form stories in a short span of time, which means that they won\u2019t need 100, 50, or even 25 episodes to tell the story of Guts. No, a mere 12 episode run time might as well be the same as the total length of Detective Conan to them! And the frantic nature of the animation shows they can do justice to berserk\u2019s fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nMove over 2D, your time has come. Far too many anime feel the need to bow to the pressures of tradition, following the old methods that were pioneered back in the 40s for gods sake! It\u2019s time to move forward, and Berserk 2016 is a perfect example of this. The 3DCG animation featured in Berserk is stunning, the best CG I\u2019ve seen since Knights of Sidonia. It really feels like you\u2019re living in the world of Sword of the Berserk: Guts\u2019 Rage, the classic dreamcast game.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the camera cuts so as to obscure most of the action is a daring, bold choice. It shows just how larger than life both Guts and his sword really are, so large they can\u2019t even fit into the screen.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nTo accompany this torrential storm of cgi animation, we have a kick-ass rock soundtrack, exactly the kind of music you\u2019d expect out of a dark fantasy series. Each song would sound right at home on a nickleback or disturbed album, and never once do they fail to fit the tone of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects however, are a different beast entirely. No cheesy sword shwing noises here, no sir. Only gritty, realistic metal clangs. The static, low quality nature of the effects only further enhances how realistic they sound. If I had one complaint, it would be that sometimes guts\u2019 dragonslayer doesn\u2019t clang loud enough for such an impressive weapon, but it is certainly an improvement over what we\u2019ve seen before.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nMillepensee has made the brilliant decision to only adapt the good parts of the manga, much like Mappa\u2019s recent Ushio and Tora. Skipping the black swordsman arc entirely, it jumps straight into the real action of the series. Never in my wildest dreams would I have expected them to reach Farnese by episode two, but they pulled it off somehow.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in another amazing move, they introduced original content into the third episode, drastically improving the pacing of the story in ways I never dreamed possible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nEach character has been distilled down to their base, root personality traits. This is a good thing, as often times the manga can be too subtle and detailed for its own good. This is much easier to follow, meaning this anime is actually BETTER then the manga it\u2019s adapting, similar to FMA 2003.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you like shows like Claymore, Overlord, Knights of Sidonia, or Sword Art Online, watch this anime immediately. I was shocked every second of this show, I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes, Berserk 2016 is an experience you have to have for yourself, I recommend checking it out on my favorite streaming site, Kissanime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nRarely does a show come around that does everything as well as this, thanks for recommending this to me Kotaku, you\u2019re the best source for anime news I can think of. I for one can't wait for the second season of this masterwork, which was announced at the end of the first cour.",

            "content": "Now I feel like Guts standing in front of the army of the new Berserk hating people. Bring it on then! No seriously I believe that many people rate this anime focused way too much on one thing, not looking at it objectively. \r\nLet's start with the main problem, the animation. It is bad! When I though I got used to it after the first episodes but another punch in the face came. Silly censorship incarnated into characters with no genitals. The animation is a mix of CG and drawn one. The CG parts are really strange. However it's not like a total fail. Someparts were beautiful. Some were sadly, hilarious. So I can't agree with statements like \"The whole animation is terrible!\". More like \"Some parts are funny. (When they are not supposed to be funny.)\"\\n\\n\r\nEnough of that. If you forget the animation, then this anime is pretty good. Exactly what I expected and wanted to see as a sequel to the original series. The dark and raw atmosphere is still there, even darker. Guts is as badass as always and you even see some old characters not only in flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also new characters that are really well made with a focus on their inner feelings. They are just humans after all and they act like that. There are some inner conflicts and deep thoughts. Also some epic quotes that we \"anime only watchers\" were waiting for!\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are very specific, especially Guts and his sword slashes will leave a trace in your memory. The music is a treasure. Really an amazing OST. (Susumu and his Hai Yo really reminded me the previous anime adaptations.) \\n\\n\r\nSo I have really enjoyed this show despite the bad expectations I had after watching the trailer. I was really wondering if I should watch or drop it. Glad I stayed. You know it was also announced that the season 2 is coming next year. Give it a shot, survive the animation torture and you'll never regret it!",

            "content": "*Minor spoilers for Golden Age and Berserk 2016 below*\r\nMiura\u2019s Berserk is a classic manga series beloved by many and deals with dark, gritty violence and mature themes. Miura started writing Berserk in 1989; however due to many factors, most of which I am not aware of, the manga has turned into Hiatus x Hiatus over the past decade or so. Berserk received an anime adaption in the 1990s covering the famous Golden Age Arc, a flashback/prequel that covers roughly 13 manga volumes, and ever since fans have been asking for a sequel. This manga is held in such high esteem by so many that asequel would never be able to live up to its hype. Manga lovers love the manga so much, and when they saw the first episode of Berserk 2016 and didn\u2019t get exactly what they had yearned for for twenty years they immediately wrote it off as a horrible adaption. I have read the manga chapters this anime adapts and, as a whole, this is a very good adaption of the Conviction Arc. \\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10):\\n\\n\r\n\tBerserk 2016 starts two years after the Golden Age Arc with Guts wandering the countryside looking for apostles so that he can question them about the God Hand, a collection of five demon-like creatures that follow the guidance of the Idea of Evil, or God. The Idea of Evil is an entity born from humanity\u2019s unconscious desire for something to blame suffering on. Among the God Hand is Femto, who was once the human Griffith and Guts\u2019 best friend. During the events of the Eclipse two years ago, Griffith became Femto by sacrificing the Band of the Hawk, his army of companions. Only Guts and Casca escape, but not without injury: Guts has lost an eye and an arm and Casca has lost her mind due to a truly horrible gang rape. Both are branded as sacrifices and these brands bleed whenever evil is near. As these brands also attract evil beings, Casca is kept safe at a friend\u2019s house while Guts roams the countryside killing apostles. He is haunted by a demon-like baby, the remains of Guts and Casca\u2019s miscarried child after Femto raped her. \\n\\n\r\n\tGuts\u2019 experiences during the Eclipse have shaped him into a cynical, violent, untrusting person. He saves Puck and inspires Isidro at a bar but doesn\u2019t warm up to either of them until later on in the story. At the same time, the Holy Iron Chain Knights have been searching the countryside for the prophesized Hawk of Darkness, a being that would plunge the world into a dark age. The Knights, led by Farnese, believe this Hawk to be Guts after encountering him in a forest and they become recurring antagonists for him throughout the anime. Guts eventually learns that Casca has been missing and goes off in search of her at the Tower of Conviction. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe most compelling part of this arc, besides the characters, is how Miura handles the concept of religion in this world. The Holy See parallels the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages and the Tower of Conviction is home to an extensive torture chamber. Refugees from war and famine surround the Tower and daily \u201cheretics\u201d are dragged into the Tower to confess their sins. One priest claims that only priests are able to interpret the Holy Scriptures. The God Hand are continuously referred to as angels, leading to the question: How do you know what you are praying to is actually a benevolent God? Some of the heretics actually go off to unknowingly worship one of the God Hand. As a whole, the followers of the Holy See are ultimately painted as hypocrites, either too blind in their faith to realize that they aren\u2019t worshiping a benevolent God or using religion as a way to excuse their personality defects. This arc is about surviving, and in a world where anyone could claim you were a heretic, all most of the refugees can do is bow their heads and do what they are told. In the end, those that ran away from the Tower survive, while those who believe in God and run to the Tower are killed. As a non-religious person, I could probably write pages on all the ideas that popped into my head about religion. It\u2019s simply fascinating. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\\n\\n\r\n\tAnother compelling part of Berserk is the rich characters that make up the story. Guts in particular is especially riveting as he slashes his way through his enemies. After the Eclipse, he cares for no one except Casca and he is a violent, untrusting person. He doesn\u2019t get much development here in the Conviction Arc, but I\u2019m excited to see him grow next season. Puck is my favorite and is the series\u2019 comic relief character along with Isidro. When he isn\u2019t a chestnut head, he usually badgers Guts about being a better person and is a source of morality for Guts early on in his quest for revenge. Unfortunately, most of this material is cut from the anime. Nina is annoying at best, but I think it\u2019s important to realize that she represents the average person and she does what she does to survive.  Lastly, Farnese is simply horrid here in this first arc as a devout follower of the Holy See. There is a lot of backstory to her that makes her who she is. Eventually, her faith has been too shaken by her encounters with Guts and malevolence that follows him. I\u2019m excited to see her grow next season as well as her character gets so much better. Griffith\u2019s character is also fascinating as the series\u2019 main antagonist, however, that is a story for another time. \\n\\n\r\nArt (4/10) and Sound (8/10): \\n\\n\r\n\tUnfortunately, the animation is terrible. Many have already complained about the awful CGI that makes up the majority of the animation, so I won\u2019t go into too much detail. Towards the end, the quality gets better, though that may be more because I got used to it. I will admit, if the story wasn\u2019t Berserk level quality, this anime would be shit. The sound is better, though the sound Guts\u2019 sword makes is jarring at first. The opening and Hai Yo are amazing. \\n\\n\r\n\tMany manga lovers will complain that the first arc and the Lost Children arc were cut and cry foul. They were cut for reasons we can only speculate on, though I do believe that the graphic depictions of children dying, killing each other, and being brutally raped were a factor in the Lost Children arc being cut. Perhaps I\u2019m just more sensitive to that sort of thing. In any case, this anime was meant to be an adaption of the Conviction Arc with background plot sprinkled into the first few episodes. Should they have marketed the anime to reflect that? Probably. Should people really be so up in arms that it cut material? No. Anime adaptions do that all the time. To be upset about such a thing is ridiculous. It\u2019s like being mad that the Harry Potter screenplays weren\u2019t directly lifted word for word from the book. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10) and Overall (8/10): \\n\\n\r\n\tBerserk 2016 is a good story packaged with shitty animation. The main problem many people have with this adaption is the animation and the fact that the manga wasn\u2019t copied panel by panel to match the Berserk anime image most dreamed of. Berserk may not be my favorite manga, but I do understand your pain (I'm a One Piece fan and the anime is killing me slowly). Yes, the animation was bad. Yes, it doesn\u2019t do the manga justice. Yes, the best thing about it is Miura\u2019s story. But is it still a good, entertaining anime and I believe that any fan of action, adventure, or fantasy will end up liking it. And if you\u2019re thirsty for more when you\u2019re done, I would recommend starting at Volume 1, Chapter 1!\\n",

            "content": "Ah Berserk. Yes, the series that fans have been waiting what seems like ages for a new adaptation. Anime adapted from manga isn\u2019t likely going to be perfect and most often times or not, they\u2019re not. Berserk is an interesting case though. The series feels like a bad date that the studio, producers, and director tries to make the best out of. In practice, you should not expect Berserk to be a dream come true. Sure, it\u2019s what fans have been eager for but the tradition of trying to match a series of such high expectations is far from reality. Berserk isn\u2019t a show that\u2019sgoing to change from that. \\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the manga, it\u2019s imperative that fans are familiarized with the franchise. If you plan to watch the series completely fresh, then it\u2019s going to be like a recipe for disaster experience. Taken for granted, the new Berserk is series focuses main protagonist Guts as the Black Swordsman that also serves as a direct sequel of the Golden Age arc.\\n\\n\r\nWith that being said, the first episode of the new Berserk series will be painful to get through. Remember that first time when you went to the dentist and had to get a tooth taken out? That\u2019s kind of how it feels like with the impression of the pilot episode. First impressions are important and unfortunately, Berserk dropped the ball. On paper, the animation quality is difficult to get used to. It uses a fusion hybrid between 2D and 3D while the action scenes looks like it\u2019s made from broken cardboards. Mediocre isn\u2019t even a word to describe the effort as the quality falls more into abomination. On the story perspective, the series is a dark fantasy journey featuring Guts. As the Black Swordsman, he is now more of an avenger, seeking vengeance against his former friend Griffith. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the storytelling about the infamous Eclipse, then you\u2019ll want to revisit a bit of that by either watching the previous season or the final movie of the trilogy. Now on his journey, he is also accompanied by a mysterious elf named Buck and later on gains new allies on the way. While the animation bombed, the story itself is also a mixed bag because by adaptation standards, it sometimes hits the right marks while other times doesn\u2019t. In retrospect, it\u2019s a condensed adaptation with some chapters being followed faithfully while others are reshuffled.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter dynamics revolves around Guts and his character relationships with the people he comes across with. Some more noticeable ones include Farnese (a leader of the Holy Iron Chain Knights), the ever so cheerful Puck, and runaway thief Isidro. One of the most important relationships from the franchise (if you can remember) was with Casca. However, the new anime downplays that until later on in the story when the two actually meets each other again. In the meantime, Guts\u2019 personality has changed greatly after the nightmarish experience he suffered from events of the Eclipse. He is both angry and also confused at what Griffith has done. Various flashbacks throughout the new season also shows that Guts suffers guilt because of how helpless he was, especially when Casca became a victim of violation. That aside, other characters introduced in the season have some memorable moments such as the courageous Luca. Even the Skull Knight makes a nostalgic appearance but like so many times, he is still a mysterious puzzle. Other characters such as Nina is mostly forgettable and in general, it\u2019s not hard to realize that the characterization is rushed.\\n\\n\r\nAs with most dark fantasy stories, expect plenty of violence. Especially for the case of Berserk, we have mature content such as horse rape, body dismemberment, bloody massacres, satanic-like rituals, etc. There\u2019s not much room for humor except for perhaps the occasional comic relief provided by Puck or Isidiro. However, I do give some praise for the show as more episodes progressed. There are even some content that is adapted frame by frame with certain episodes. In keeping tradition of the mature content, some of violence is uncensored. My only pique is the awkward nudity and sex scenes especially with the non-existent nipples on female characters. I guess they had to remove some of that to fit the content to be tolerable for airing on TV. In the meantime, the show follows its tagline pretty well:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cSleepless nights shall begin\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nAnd damn right they shall. \\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, it sort of feels like Berserk\u2019s production staff thrown themselves into this project without being fully ready. Early episodes gave us weak impression of the animation quality whether it\u2019s the action scenes or character designs. Luckily, the series does improve a bit more later on as some chapters are even adapted symmetrically frame by frame. In general, it ends up being more of a mixed bag that bounces between trashy to decent for its animation.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the new Berserk really shines when it comes to the music and soundtrack. If there\u2019s anything memorable to take to heart for the first few episodes, it would be the OST. The stellar choreography combined with its instrumental style will make you awe. Character voice mannerism is generally decent with Guts still showing off his manliness and why he lives up to his Black Swordsman nickname.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s quite easy to mock the new Berserk at first. The animation looks like it\u2019s a preview of a CGI video game and the storytelling has a rocky start. Yet as time went on, fans can feel somewhat more appreciated by the adaptation. It probably isn\u2019t at a level where we\u2019d expect to every episode to be 1:1 in terms of faithfulness. In a perfect world, maybe. But for Berserk? That\u2019s more of a fantasy. Still, I would give the new Berserk a try. It\u2019s nostalgic enough to give viewers some treat. And plus, who wouldn\u2019t want to see some ass kicking from the Black Swordsman himself?\\n",

            "content": "Be careful what you wish for, because you might just receive it.\r\nFans of the original 1997 series of Berserk, and the manga by extension, could not have imagined how dangerous this desire could be.  Diving into the realm of retelling one of the hallmark stories of the entire manga industry, must have seemed foolproof \u2014 or, at the very least, risk-adverse.  But, alas, even the strongest source material is no match for horrendous 3D animation and mediocre directorial talent.  Something is not always superior to nothing, and, in fact, may induce detrimental blemishes on an otherwise fantastic series.  Not only doesthis new series mutilate an ongoing classic, but it distorts the perception of Guts to a younger generation of anime viewers.  Diminishing the chances of future installments that are faithful to the franchise.  That being said, after viewing the abhorrent farrago that is Berserk (2016), I doubt fans will be clamoring for additional adaptations in the near future.  Only time can heal the ocular wounds that were inflicted upon viewers while watching this abomination.\\n\\n\r\nA myriad of words come to mind when watching the animation of Berserk (2016); eliminating the numerous profane words, however, leaves us with one encapsulating word: nauseating.  Seriously.  The camera never stops moving.  Constant panning shots make it exceedingly difficult for the viewer to know where they should be focusing their attention.  Simple details like depth perception are completely disregarded, as I honestly could not decipher the distance between objects and people on several occasions.  Spinning the camera around characters, particularly in the battle scenes, obfuscates characters relative positions on the screen, making it challenging to follow actions and movements.  Pausing the episode(s) to relieve symptoms of vertigo, however, leave the viewer with the unholy prospect of staring at the egregious character designs that even Stevie Wonder would find repulsive.  Everything about Guts, and the other characters by default, seems so stiff, inflexible, and unyielding.  Translating this to battle scenes makes the characters look like rigid action figures that a teenage kid decided to film with his iPhone.  Its not a pleasant viewing experience.  Let us not forget the superfluous cross-shading implanted on the character\u2019s faces to feign complexity and detail.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the infliction of pain does not carry any verifiable weight.  As evidence of this fact, rewatch episode two when Guts is shackled by the Holy Iron Chain Knights and is whipped by Lady Farnese.  Immediately after Guts received numerous lashes, he is removed from the tent with no visible wounds.  This would imply that during the show\u2019s lengthy hiatus, Guts developed the ability to use a modified version of Wolverine\u2019s  healing factor \u2014 or, more plausible, the animators were indolent [expletive word implied] who couldn\u2019t be bothered to do their job.  Or perhaps they simply forgot.  In either case, it portrays an apathetic staff with poor leadership and direction.  Speaking of which, why was an anime studio with past credentials of: Teekyuu 5; Usakame; and Wake up, Girls! Shin Shou (there\u2019s a valid reason you haven\u2019t heard of these anime); hired to revive the story of Guts?  Surely, some other studio with an aptitude for handling intense action sequences would be more suitable for this kind of work.  Of course, this wishful thinking, for all intensive purposes, is a moot point.  We are stuck lamenting the appalling state in which Berserk currently finds itself in.\\n\\n\r\nThe substandard animation not only contaminates one\u2019s visual acuity, but it corrupts the story itself.  Herein lies the problem with adapting a manga from the great Kentarou Miura.  The level of detail placed into the character\u2019s expressions, alone, tells a story in and of itself.  This, unfortunately, disrupts several key moments, as character expressions do not convey the proper tone.  A quick review of the manga will exemplify this statement, and give the viewer a better perspective and appreciation of Berserk the manga.  In terms of specific source material that was altered or omitted altogether, there are two arcs, in particular, that have significant differences from the manga: parts of The Black Swordsman Arc, when Guts attains the Behelit and the reader learns about his quest to track down Apostles (we are also introduced to The God Hand \u2014 and Griffith by default); and The Lost Children Chapter, which doesn\u2019t necessarily tie into the main story, but highlights how coarse Guts has become since the events of the eclipse.  Skipped source material aside, the story that is covered \u2014 at least, from my perspective \u2014 feels unnecessarily accelerated, making events seem disconnected from each other, as opposed to being part of an interconnected narrative.  The anime staff, in my opinion, needs to eliminate ambiguous lapses by slowing the story down to allow events to occur organically, .  As it stands, the anime feels like a bullet point presentation of the manga, moving from one section to the next without consideration for fluidity.\\n\\n\r\nAs we have established, there seems to be a general misunderstanding from the anime staff regarding the source material and how it should be presented.  This, unfortunately, extends into the music selection as well.  The opening track has a punk rock vibe that is incompatible with Guts personal plight.  We must understand the incomprehensible circumstances of Guts life (from birth to the present moment) and how his anger conceals the tortured soul that resides within.  Having a rapid paced, generic sounding opening track neglects the inner turmoil that most of the characters must overcome in their day to day lives.  Furthermore, the opening spoils most of the critical elements from The Golden Age Arc, diminishing the prospect of new viewers wanting to go back and watch the original series/movies (although, the movies were quite the gallimaufry themselves).\\n\\n\r\nRecommending this new iteration of Berserk is a sin of the worst kind.  Okay, well, there are worse atrocities than watching a horrendous anime, but you understand my point.  Rather than allow the proverbial rape horse to confiscate your puerile anime innocence, do yourself a favor: read the manga, and pretend this anime never existed.",

            "content": "Finally we get another Berserk anime adaption, we can't help but expect highly. Of course it's fine to expect high but for your own good, put those expectations away and listen to what I have to say. \r\nThis season of Berserk brings us a totally different animation, camera angles and sound effects. I will explain these 3 in detail below.\r\nANIMATION:\r\nThis time CG is used for the entire anime. Not like the movies, this is done in just CG with it's own unique style. This unique style isn't interesting to be honest, it's just how the characters were adapted by the studio. The character always havefaded lines on them. The reason why they put them there I don't know. In any case the CG can get very bad, this also makes it difficult for us to get into and actually concentrate.\\n\\n\r\nCAMERA ANGLES:\\n\r\nThis is important for any anime to succeed, having a great camera movement and positioning. Unfortunately this anime didn't have neither. It was very messy, this leaves the audience confused at times because the camera angles doesn't follow the rules. This is no doubt the biggest flaw.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nop&ed - The opening is bait, it's very catchy but the anime doesn't live up to what the op shows us. \\n\r\nsound effects - Right now get two saucepans and clash them againts eachother and get used to the sound. That sound is a very similar to the sound effect of Guts sword. I personally like it so i'm not complaining but there is a lot of criticism about this. If's not metal then there isn't much to discuss.\\n\r\nsound tracks - Very good tracks that work well for this anime. Sometimes the tracks are used wrongly but overall the soundtracks play the most important part.\\n\\n\r\nThose features in Berserk (2016) is what made it unsuccessful. ^\\n\\n\r\nCONTENT:\\n\r\nArcs skipped - 2\\n\r\nFiller amount - almost a whole episode\\n\r\nStory - interesting and fun at the same time. Not great progress but good development.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nIt's disappointing, but you shouldn't lose hope in the modern Berserk. It improves but not enough to prevent users dropping it. It's your decision on what your going to do but remember that this might be the last Berserk series we going to get. You could always wait and wait for a doubtful better adaption.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTATS:\\n\\n\r\n(6 weeks ago)\\n\r\nMembers:106,012\\n\r\nUsers scored: 43,559\\n\r\nRating: 6.76\\n\\n\r\n(Current)\\n\r\nMembers:110,603  (4,591+)\\n\r\nUsers scored: 46,412  (2,853+)\\n\r\nRating: 6.77  (0.01+)\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: 6/6/17 21:10 PM\\n\r\nEpisodes watched: 12\\n\r\nModified by Jeikobu11\\n\\n",

And on top of all they include nearly all parts of the storry i missed in the \"97 anime. \r\nAnd even if u are not lucky about it.. u dont need to watch the anime.

            "content": "As you probably know, Berserk is one of the most well-respected and loved manga series off all time, being serialized for over 27 years. With an anime adaptation made in a late 90\u2019s and its three remake movies that came out not too long ago, Berserk\u2019s well-known flashback arc got a complete adaptation, even if it wasn\u2019t the most loyal. But never has Berserk got an adaptation of everything that happens after the events of the Golden Age arc, until recently that is. The 2016 anime adapts its sequel arc, the Conviction arc (albeit skimming its introductory arc and cutting out a filler mini-arc). Thoughit may not be the adaptation fans were hoping, and it sure isn\u2019t getting much praise, I found it hard not to enjoy this adaptation, even with its obvious flaws. Despite the amateurish directing, inconsistent pacing, and some horrid, horrid CGI animations, the anime is able to overcome its flaws with good characterization, great style/tone and some amazing background music. No matter how bad an adaptation Berserk gets, nothing can overshadow Miura\u2019s talentless writing and world-building as long as it\u2019s adapting the manga.\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nA popular misbelief amongst newcomers is that the new Berserk anime is an alternate version of the previous adaptations, and that you can watch it without watching the previous ones. That is absolutely false! This adaptation is a sequel to the Golden Age arc so unless if you haven\u2019t watch the 90\u2019s TV series or the three CGI movies, you better watch those first. This is the first time Berserk got an adaptation of what happened after the events of the Eclipse and how Guts\u2019 revenge went. The story of the Conviction arc is about the now \u201cbranded\u201d Guts finding the now \u201cvegetable-state\u201d Casca while fighting against a religious cult and a whole lot of Apostles that will hunt Guts down until he\u2019s dead. It\u2019s a nice follow-up to the dark and disturbing end of the Golden Age arc which focuses less on a Guts who wants to find out what he values, and more on the Guts who wants to protect what he values the most. Though the story doesn\u2019t feel as impactful and enjoyable as how it was depicted in the manga due to its directing problems and weird pacing. And the animation quality sure didn\u2019t help either. But due to Miura\u2019s excellent writing in the manga, even a mediocre adaptation can\u2019t cover up the good things Berserk has to offer. \\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nDespite the remarks others make about this adaptation, this is actually quite a loyal adaptation of the Conviction arc. Not much of that arc was actually cut out, but pacing was quite uneven. Some episodes adapted more chapters than other making this adaptation somewhat a bumpy ride. But other than that, the anime did the same thing the manga did. There\u2019s one change in the location for the third episode though, but nothing too jarring. However, a mini-arc that takes place prior to the Conviction arc was skipped, although the skipped mini-arc plays no major role in the overall story. And the Black Swordsman arc got skimmed\u2026 again! But again, it doesn\u2019t make a big difference. But the biggest problem with this Berserk adaptation is the directing. Despite the fact that the style was just like the manga and the tone is similar to manga (including the lighthearted moments too), the way the anime was presented felt weird to say the least. Due to the lack of proper transitions between scenes, it feels like as if the anime is jumping between scenes, and it makes the overall experience feel jarring. And although the comedic moments are the same as the manga, the tonal shift feels jarring in the anime. But this is a common problem between many manga adaptations where the comedic panels can\u2019t be properly placed in a serious situation without feeling jarring. Also, some of the cinematography in the anime is weird too. The close-ups for the character faces are a little too close up and the camera moves around too much during action scenes, making it a little nauseous. However, whenever the camera follows the Dragonslayer, it\u2019s pretty damn cool.\\n\r\nPresentation: 2/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nThe anime doesn\u2019t waste time on characterization for Guts since it assumes you\u2019ve watched the Golden Age arc (and you should before watching this anime). Guts, who is now branded for restless nights of being hunted, is now bloodthirsty to kill the person who he once considered his first friend and the first person who truly understood Guts. The story of Berserk has always been about Guts and this anime is no exception. Guts is already a well-developed character by the start of the series, however he gets more improvements to his characterization. This anime establishes that Guts is more than a man with a vengeance, but also a man willing to protect the only thing he loves. The other major returning character is Casca, a once strong-willed woman who is now mentally broken and unstable. There\u2019s not much to develop for her character due to her current state, but she\u2019s relevant for the plot. A character that was cut out from the 90\u2019s adaptation makes a debut in this series. Puck, who was originally cut out do to him being a comic relief character, now is in this anime to add a bit of humor and commentary. His character is handled faithfully and his chemistry with Guts is fun. Also, due to a mini-arc that develops on Guts and Puck\u2019s relationship being cut out, the relationship feels a tad weaker compared to the manga. Talking about comic relief characters, and new character named Isidro is introduced and he\u2019s a nice addition to the comic relief. He\u2019s not a complex character or anything (well not until the next arc), but he\u2019s enjoyable and he\u2019s fondness for Guts is adorable in some sense. Two other major characters are introduced, Farnese and Serpico. Farnese is a character who is deeply delusional about her religion and finds herself in stuck between two choices. Serpico on the other hand is more of a man how takes things logically and uses hits wits over his strength during combat. Both characters are nice additions to an already great cast. \\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nWith its CGI animation, it is to be expected that the art will lack a great deal of detailing. Character models are what looks the worst as they\u2019re the ones that are animated using CGI. Outfits look fine, and Guts\u2019 armor looks pretty good, but the character faces looks bad. Due to the lack of detailing, character expressions look plain, unexpressive, and downright weird at times. And the anime using hatching as shading (lines) and it works well when in manga format, but it\u2019s distracting in anime format. The studio thought that hatching can add some volume to their bland character models, but unfortunately it looks worse. Most of the backgrounds are 2D instead of 3D and the contrast of quality is visible. Many of the backgrounds are quite pretty, especially the insides of buildings. The lighting is also quite good, but some shadows can look a little weird. Sometimes 2D art is used for characters for tiny moments to add a greater affect and these moments look quite good. If only the entire series had that art quality.\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nSome studios tend to use CGI to makes sequences looks smoother and more fluid, in sacrifice for art quality. The new Berserk anime sacrificed its art quality, while managing to make their CGI choppier than imaginable. The lack of smoothness isn\u2019t entirely bad during normal scenes, but during action-scenes (which is most of the series), it ends up being headache-inducing. But it\u2019s not just the choppiness that\u2019s the issue, but also the cinematography too. Too many zoom-ins make it hard to see what\u2019s actually going on and the camera movies to much during action sequences. There are \u201cstill-shot\u201d moments where only some things are animated, while somethings are not, and these moments can look quite distracting. For example, in episode 2\u2019s first fight, after Guts cuts down countless knights in one strike, many of the surviving knights looks at Guts in shock. During this moments, none of the knights are actually animated and are still and the same goes for Guts too, yet the wind is still blowing Guts\u2019 cape and it just looks really weird. Whenever the 2D moments happen, they aren\u2019t really animated much, except for their lips moving while they\u2019re talking and that\u2019s it. And the 2D backgrounds too can also look quite static. \\n\r\nAnimation: 3/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nMany of the seiyuu from the Golden Age movie trilogy lend their voices in this anime. Iwanaga Hiroaki returns back to voice Guts and he\u2019s just as good as he was in the movies. His voice is quite similar to Ono Daisuke\u2019s, but he can add the coarse feel of Guts. And he\u2019s able to make Guts sound super badass too! Yukinari Toa returns to voice Casca, and even though her character doesn\u2019t have much to speak, he does a good job in what she has to do. And Sakurai Takahiro (who seems to be everywhere recently) returns to do Griffith and does a great job\u2026 but too bad you\u2019ll only get to hear him say a couple of lines. Hikasa Yoko does a great job as the religious and somewhat weird Farnese and Okitsu Kazuyuki does a very good job as Serpico and his sarcastic tone works well with his character. Mizuhara Kaoru makes Puck sound exactly as I how imagined it to be and Shimono Hiro, though sounding too old for his character, does his best as Isidro. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe best thing about the previous Berserk adaptations were its music and this anime is no exception. As a matter of a fact, it\u2019s not farfetched to say that this adaptation has the best background music when compared to the previous adaptations. The OP, \u201cInferno\u201d, is pretty good and catchy and it matches with the new tone of Berserk. The lyrics in general are quite good. The ED, \u201cMeimoku no Kanata\u201d, is a great song with great vocals, but it doesn\u2019t completely suit Berserk and something else, something more depressing would\u2019ve been better. But the adaptation\u2019s biggest strength it its background music and insert songs. First of all, Hirasawa\u2019s new song for Berserk, \u201cHai Yo\u201d is fantastic. I personally believe that its better than \u201cSign\u201d and \u201cAria\u201d, and it\u2019s on the same caliber as \u201cForces\u201d. It\u2019s used quite a lot, but it never gets boring. Then we have Hirasawa\u2019s second insert song \u201cAsh Crow\u201d, which is only used once, but it\u2019s great and it works well (Note: Hirasawa\u2019s newly released album features the two insert songs, a really dope mix of \u201cForces\u201d and some other well-known Berserk songs. Be sure to check that out). A lot of the background music are remixes of the movie trilogy\u2019s OST. The \u201cBlood & Guts\u201d, \u201cMy Brother\u201d, and \u201cGriffith's Dream\u201d are fantastic and some of the techno music in the series only adds to action. \\n\r\nMusic: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nThis may have not been the adaptation people were hoping to see, but even with such a mediocre adaptation, quite a lot of enjoyment was found to be seen. Even though a mini-arc skipped, what was adapted was adapted well. Some messy directing and haphazard pacing ruins the experience. And the CGI animation quality looks pretty bad most of the time. Miura\u2019s original writing still shines through these issues and the music just makes things better. It\u2019s nice to have more of Hirasawa\u2019s music and those Golden Age OST remixes are great. And when the 2D style is used, it looks nice. But only in a perfect world many we ever get the Berserk adaptation we wished for. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this new Berserk adaptation is only recommended for those who can withstand the mediocre art and animations and inconsistent directing. As an adaptation of the Conviction arc, it was quite loyal despite its weird pacing and lack of proper transitioning between scenes. The new characters that are introduced are handled well and the voice acting is great too. And even if you get nothing out of this adaptation, you still have Hirasawa\u2019s godly insert songs and great Golden Age OST remixes to listen to while Guts cuts down countless men and supernatural creatures. And unlike most people, I can\u2019t wait to see the next arc adapted next spring!\\n\\n\r\n+ A loyal adaptation of the Conviction arc with no important moments being skipped.  \\n\r\n+ Both the returning and new characters are great and well-handled.  \\n\r\n+ Berserk\u2019s tone, style, and (new) comedic relief is handled well. \\n\r\n+ Great remixes of older Berserk OSTs and Hirasawa\u2019s two insert songs are fantastic. \\n\r\n- Amateurish directing at some points and inconsistent pacing ruins the experience\\n\r\n- Lackluster CGI animations, which feels even more jarring when contrasted with its 2D backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.3/10",

The Anime is extremly close to the manga and the new music fits in perfectly with the scenes, at least after you get used to it.

The new series doesnt tell you a lot of what happened before and you really need the information to get the picture.

            "content": "Before I begin, I would like to allow the readers some comfort in knowing that although I shall include my personal thoughts, I'll primarily be typing in an objective way of which will in fact differ with that of my thoughts at times. Also I'll not be lowering or raising my opinions on trivial matters such as the old series or the manga, as that is a comparison and not a proper judgement to this work as itself.\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\r\nAnd now, to dive right in I\u2019ll start with the story. For someone with no former knowledge of the series, it will most undoubtedly be confusing at times,especially for questions specifically regarding individual characters. Your first thoughts must be something along the lines of \u201cso you\u2019re telling me the plot / character development is slow if not bad, right?\u201d, however, you could look at it in a lighter sense where things are gradually being fleshed out for you rather than put on a platter since most questions will be answered at one point or another. And all those who\u2019ve Berserk knowledge already should find the pacing is fairly well as there isn\u2019t much for pointless content, most episodes seem fairly consistent in tossing a plethora of both action and plot progression. Though it is somewhat hasty, I personally find that any less would be too slow and any more would be too flashy. It seems to get straight toward the point. And so, for a solid and consistent story covering many things gradually while still keeping you wanting to find out more, personally I would like to give it a 9/10 but alas I have to say 8/10. I talk a little about where the first episode started in the final paragraph.\\n\r\nSTORY 8/10\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nThe part most people probably are curious to see as it is under such heavy debate, the artwork. Now, I\u2019m just going to say that having an anime made in CG isn\u2019t on its own a bad thing, but it really depends on the specific series. There are some where they just look terrible, and yet others use CG effectively such as Berserk 2016. Even if you are one of those who dislike CG, for the potential of CG all in all it at least is better than other works. Personally I find this series to be better with CG but for a few reasons, such as: The medieval theme really pushes the use of CG compared to other themes because the scenery/weapons/armors/etc. all have a more serious look and feel to them, imo at least. Another thing is that the manga is drawn inexpressively well, and although this art style lacks the immaculate detail the manga has, it still yields very crisp lines, smooth motion which is most prominent in gracious looking battle sequences, vibrant colors especially during effects. Now, you may disagree with my opinion and points all you want but at least have a valid reason to prefer 2D over 3D art styles other than the repeated \u201cIt has no detail\u201d or \u201cIt looks absolutely ugly\u201d because trust me, there are probably hundreds of shows that look worse. I won\u2019t only compliment it though, there are moments where it doesn\u2019t quite look right and the most noticeable con to this is some of the characters faces. Do note also, that there are times throughout this series where they immerse themselves between 2D and 3D to emphasize certain moments. I personally have no reason to dislike an art style so I would probably have rated it higher, but I understand some people cannot simply sit for that, and that is perfectly fine.\\n\r\nART STYLE 7/10\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nThe audio in this season is absolutely fantastic, and that\u2019s coming from a soundtrack enthusiast. The music tracks are all fairly epic and usually play out at the perfect times, such as the suspenseful tunes when things get dangerous, can really send a chill down your back. Or the amazing \u201cHai yo\u201d track used during battles or important events really gets the fire burning and pulls you into the moment.\\n\r\nThe sound effects are phenomenal as well, with each swing of a weapon, foot step, movements, etc. all have sounds and they are indeed a welcome piece to the show. They at times sound out of place but I\u2019d say they generally have spot on sounds, and so I cannot complain. \\n\r\nThe voice acting is very sound too, they did a good job for their parts and really added that Berserk feel if you know what I mean. The voices actually make sense and sound as they should, when situations are raised and tension increases the voices do not falter.\\n\r\nPersonally, I find that the sounds/music can make or break a scene in an anime, and so if you are like that I think it will be a great watch for you during those moments.\\n\r\nSOUND 9/10\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nThe characters are fantastic but as the story would have it, in this season we aren\u2019t gifted with much if any back story or in depth character development. Sure we know a few things but we aren\u2019t given too much information, this applies to basically all characters. It simplifies these characters quite a lot, which some may prefer and others may find offense toward. For Guts his action scenes are a spectacle and his attitude adds to the moments quite nicely. I find his character to be enjoyable and giving you the sense of wanting more. The other characters are fleshed out in certain scenes which is a relief, and it helps to show that though they\u2019re simplified, you can still get a feel for some of them. For those old time Berserk fans, the dialogue might be off throughout the episodes but it should still be somewhat good to say the least. And though you may be used to more in depth character plot and development from the franchise, if you dislike that aspect it is fully understandable. Change isn\u2019t always something people want.\\n\r\nCHARACTER 9/10\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nNow, I\u2019m not the kind of person to give a perfect score but in this case a 10 for enjoyment means it had an effect or impression left upon me. Granted you might not enjoy it or you may but with different opinions to that of my own, but either way I hope these words managed to help you decide whether or not it\u2019s something for you. Personally, I very much so enjoyed this series and I hope the same can apply to you all.\\n\r\nP.S \u2013 For those who just  think it is bad because there is CG, and or only think the good looking moments are the 2D scenes, let me just ask you this: \u201cAre you really serving justice to the franchise your fandom is so loyal toward? Sure it isn\u2019t 2D, but it can\u2019t look wholly bad can it?\u201d Just one more thing too, for those disappointed on where episode 1 starts, since the second season is going to air in 2017 according to the end of episode 12, sure it doesn\u2019t transition very well but it still picked a starting point to carry on from. The moment a new series aired so many years later, you shouldn\u2019t have expected it to transition nicely or you were really just setting yourself up for disappointment. People would hope for it but you would still know it\u2019s probably unlikely. This section isn\u2019t a rant, just my final attempt to hopefully make long time Berserk fans enjoy this series a little more rather than being upset, after all it\u2019s been ages since new TV content, we shouldn\u2019t accept what we don\u2019t like but at least see it out to the end.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 10/10\\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nThank you, and if anyone took offense to this than I apologise. \\n\r\nOVERALL 8.6/10 so rounded up to -> 9/10\\n",

            "content": "\"That anime was too bad to be called Berserk. Too rough, too crappy, too cgi and far too choppy. It was more like a large piece of shit.\"\r\nSo, the new adaptation of Berserk is finally here, everyone was excited, and even if the pv's already were pretty bad and we knew it was going to look ugly, atleast we could expect the story to be presented and the anime to be enjoyable. Was that the case? Oh boy....\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe promise here was that we would finally see the Black Swordsman arc animated, finally the story would move on from the Golden Age. Instead what weget was a 1st episode that managed to skip 6 volumes from the manga, both Black Swordsman and Lost Children arcs, and moved right into the Conviction arc and even then, they rushed it like hell to fit the arc in 12 episodes. This, apart from not being what was promised, was done in a terrible way. Someone that has only seen the 1997 anime and expects this to be a direct continuation, which it should have been, will be completely lost. They do a terrible job of mixing things from the arcs they skiped, and give no form of conection to the former series so viewers not familiar with the manga can follow. It is safe to say this adaptation is a flop.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2\\n\r\nCgi in a budget tv series will never look good, and it looks even worse when it's done by people who have no experience in it. The characters look dull and lifeless, the movement looks janky, backgrounds are terrible and everything just feels like no effort was put into it. Another big problem here is the overall direction of the shots, always jumping from scene to scene like some kid with ADHD together with a terrible use of camera movement makes percieving what is happening in moments with alot of action almost impossible. The amount of zoom in's used is so often that at some points it feels like the characters will hit pop out of the screen or something. I think the biggest problem here was with the director which his bigger works are a sports/comedy short series with frantic animation and camera movements. It might work for something like that, it does not work with a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nI liked the voice acting in this show, in some characters it doesn't fit, but for the most part i think they are fine. Some of the music are good, mostly tracks they used from the movie trilogy and a great track from Susumu Hirasawa. However the rest of the bgm used is very forgetable and generic. The issue here is how they were used, jumping from scene to scene, ending abruptly and sometimes not fitting the moment they are placed, this again a problem from the way the director did things. Opening and ending themes were alright, i don't think they fit but they weren't terrible. My biggest problem was the sound effects, they ranged from bad to worse and the biggest offender was the memetastic CLANG you hear everytime Guts hits something with this sword. And yes the sound is always the same, no matter what is being hit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nWell then when you cut so much from the story, you are obviously cutting character development as well. The biggest offender of this is the relation between Guts and Puck. It feels unnatural and forced how they in one episode don't get along and in the next they are best buds. Overral, some characters do behave how they should, but with the skiping and rushing of content it doesn't feel natural.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this one bit, being a huge fan of the manga this felt like a bad joke. What really makes me pissed is that this kills any potential for a good adaptation in the future, well atleast until the manga finishes and who know when that day will come.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nIt's bad, there is no other way to put it. It's an insult to the source material, and it baffles me how something as big and well renowned as Berserk can't get a good project from some talented team who really cares about it. Well, then again Miura also doesn't care too much about an anime adaptation, as long as he puts his all to make the manga the best he can and Idolmaster exists he is chillin.\\n\\n\r\nPeople died in the 19 years waiting for a new anime and this is what we got.",

            "content": "Not only a bad adaptation of Berserk, but a horrible anime overall. Can only recommend this piece of shit to people without taste, they seem to like it.\r\n     Story - 4\\10. And those 4 points exist only because i'ts an adaptation of Kentaro Miura's Magnum Opus and has some ok'ish points. But's it's so butchered - it's impossible to give it even one more point. ALL character development was cut in favour of 360 MEGA SUPER PRO ACTION, which i will talk later.\r\n    Art - 1\\10. It's so pathetic i don't know, if i want to talk aboutit. Neither the director, nor the animtors themselves know, what the hell they were doing. It seems, like they just looked up word \"art\" and \"action\" on wikipedia and tried to make a show out of that. Needless to say - they failed to deliver. Absolutelly horrendous animation, unbearable 3d models of literally everything and shitty shadows do it's best to make you puke. \\n\r\n  Oh, and i forgot about the \"best\" part - every damn fight (which is about 90% of this adaptation) is 360 NOSCOPE shot from the blade of Gut's sword Dragonslayer. + terrible montage makes it impossible to even witness those fights. They are literally cut out for faster pacing. For example: A guy throws a large stone on the group of heroes. It would be safe to assume, that we'll be shown, how they avoid it. ANd in this show they simply skip next 5 seconds to the point, where said stone destroyed a wall. It feels like someone developed King Crimson for \"reasons\".\\n\\n\r\n    Sound - 4\\10. Just like with the story, those 4 points only exist because of a treasure, that is Susumu Hirasawa. And imagine what? They destroyed even his music with this terrible show. Don't get me wrong, his ONLY song, which plays in almost every fight scene in great, but it just doesn't fit in with marionettes efortless fights. Like i mentioned, Hirasawa only made one track for this new anime, and oh boy the studio loved it. A bit too much, to say the least. They used it everywhere they could, and where they couldn't - they used their own shitty metal, which desn't seem to fit either. \\n\r\n  Every damn scene in this abomination has some sort of a theme. There are literally no quiet moments, no suspence, no thrill. It's just afraid of being \"empty\", being a full trashcan in result.\\n\r\nAnd don't forget *CLANG* of Dragonslayer. It cut's metal - CLANG, people - CLANG, monsters - CLANG, ghosts - CLANG and so on. It's the only noise it makes. Why? Is it really THAT hard to record any other suound?\\n\\n\r\n    Character - 3/10. Like i said in the \"Story\" part - there is no character development. They skipped all of them just to get more of that \"action\".\\n\r\n  Hell, i can't enjoy Gut's being badass, because his 3d-model looks like a fucking banana. And there is no reason for him doing, what he does. Why does he want to save Casca? \"WHO CARES? LET'S GET MORE 360-SHOTS!\" Why does he reject religion in any way, makes fun of it? \"BLAH-BLAH-BLAH!\"\\n\\n\r\n    Enjoyment - 1\\10. Do i really need to say why it's so low? So yeah, i was about to rear my hair and rip my own eyes out.\\n\\n\r\n    Overall - 2\\10. You can say, that even with such horrendous art and butchered story it should be like 1-2 points higher. Perhaps, but i don't want to encourage makers of this shit any more, than i should. I don't know how things really are, but i think the director was the biggest reason it sucks so much. There is no sence of direction, over 12 episodes you have no idea, where this is going and why. They tried their hardest to fail. They REALLLY tried to fail and on that - it delivers. GOOD JOB ON FUCKING THINGS UP!\\n\\n\r\n   I am sorry for my harsh language and kind of avarage english. I hope you understood, what i tried to say and why i said, what i did. Please don't give this piece of shit any praise just because it's an adaptaion of Berserk. By this you are just spitting on potential quality.",

            "content": "Presentation/Animation 0/10: I'm glad that I label this as \"Presentation/Animation\" rather than Art & Animation be because to even label this as art is derogatory to everything else I've ever experienced. Labeling this as art would be a farce of which the world has never seen. The animation and \"\"art\"\" in this show is extremely overrated. Myriad [there's that word again] addresses to the \"animation\" in this include \"Berserk isn't about the look\", \"It's not that bad\". \"I prefer it over the 1997 version\", and other garbage not worth mentioning. This is so poor it's honestly a deconstruction and subversion of what makes literally anythingnot terrible. Merely watching this is like wanting to sneeze for 20 minutes, getting a tissue, and finding out the tissue you grabbed was actually a heavily used, AIDS infected washcloth from Somalia. Anyway, let's deconstruct and subvert YOUR (yes, you, the reader)'s expectations on the previous 3 \"arguments\". Half of the appeal of Berserk is undeniably the look. It is that bad, and if you don't think this you've traumatized yourself and fooled yourself into thinking it's \"not that bad\". The 1997 looks far better than this, period. I'm not bothering to explain this to the same mongrels that spam this stupid \"limited animation\" MEME.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Characters 0.5/10: Gee, maybe if the presentation/animation wasn't so bad the characters could actually emote their ugly pointy chin faces. But hey, at least they adapted all the new arcs, except for you know, the very first one, The Black Swordsman, which after THREE adaptations has still not been animated. Or the Conviction arc immediately following the Golden Age which leads directly into the next arc, which now makes no sense. \\n\\n\r\nMyriad Defenses 0/10: Why do people even think this is watchable, let alone good? The worst part of this is the people that claim to watch this for the story which now makes basically no sense with all the arc skipping and rigid character moments.  Oh, and the soundtracks are god-awful. I literally turned down the volume every time that screeching Korean pop-rock opening played. They even had the nerve to spam that music during the show, as if it was supposed to make a scene EPIC and COOL. It kind of makes me sad this show and the second season is rated so highly.",

The things we can point as negative is that it's a different kind of \r\nanimation from the original, but that one as been released 20 years ago. \r\nIt also as a low frame rate, which makesthings less fluid.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the character design, Guts and the rest of the Taka no Dan are as they\\n\r\nshould be, slightly older, we can't forget that this one takes place a couple \\n\r\nof years after the original. Griffith design however seems to different unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nEnough talking about the controversial visual part, let's get to the part that most matters, the story.\\n\\n\r\nGuts is in his search for his beloved Casca and for the Apostles, which will lead him to a land where the church as lots of influence. Casca as lost her mind in the depths of hell, the same time Guts as been marked to be chasen by demons for the rest of his life.\\n\\n\r\nThe story that follows will have several interesting subjects, the Inquisition, thrust an betrayal, the doubts of the Church Knights' Captain about religion and her inner sado-masochist side. We also have lots of violence, due to Guts' fights with the soldiers and the demons and the tortures of the inquisition.\\n\\n\r\nIsidoro and a group of hookers, whose leader Luca have been taking care of Casca, also make their appearance and will accompany Guts, bringing a few interesting stories with them. There is also Puck... a fairy that tries to bring a bit of comedy, it's a meaningless addition.\\n\\n\r\nSo we get a interesting story, but it's pace it's kind of slow, we could get it all compressed to 4 or 5 episodes without losing much, as it loses a bit of time setting the mood and with some of the hookers side stories.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's worth watching, but is not as good a the 1997 one, without Griffith and all those conspiracies for power and amazing battles between armies, it couldn't be the same thing. \\n\r\nAlthough it ends with a bang, what might make things more interesting next season.\\n\\n\r\nI give a 7, while the 1997 I gave a 9.",

            "content": "Berserk has a very passionate fan base. When Berserk 2016 was announced the majority of Berserk's followers were caught by surprise. This is the first time in 19 years we were getting a new anime adaptation, and to top it off, the story was finally going to progress past the Golden Age Arc. Sadly, excitement and eagerness gradually began to form into something different, anxiety and doubt. The question of whether it would be animated in 2D or 3D, where the story will pick up, and if it would faithfully follow the source material. As more information was released our doubts came to fruition. Fromthe first PV we realized that the animation would be an odd mixture of 2D and 3D animation, which isn't something new to us, as the Golden Age Trilogy movies used the same animating technique. The problem was that it looked stiff, lacked fluidity, and overall looked sub par. As an addition, we later learned that nearly the entirety of the Black Swordsman Arc and the Lost Children chapters, which were part of the Conviction Arc were to be skipped. Expectations were at an all-time low. \\n\\n\r\nThe general quality of the show started at rock bottom, but as the season progressed it gradually began to improve itself. It is obvious that the directors were listening to fan suggestions and were actively working to show results. The first episode of Berserk was quickly condensed into an amalgamation of the Black Swordsman Arc, and parts of the Conviction Arc, which made for very awkward pacing. Characters were introduced that wouldn't be shown for many volumes later in the manga, massive character development was cut,  and a few notable moments from the cut material were sloppily crammed in to try and kick start the story. This set the first few episodes up for a rough start, which took until around after episode 3 to get back on a more steady path. The dark atmosphere and overall feeling of dread that Berserk is so well known for is generally poorly portrayed. Many aspects go into this, the soundtrack being one of the largest and most notable reasons. Critical lines of dialogue were also removed, but putting the cut content aside, the main substance of the story was very faithfully adapted. So in terms of story you're getting the expected quality of Berserk. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the cut content leaves close to no character development. The Black Swordsman Arc and early Conviction Arc is very important in coming to understand Guts' character. The exclusion of Jill was a massive hit to the character development, as she was arguably one of the first main causes of Guts' transition from an embodiment of rage and revenge to a more caring and compassionate character. In fact, almost all of the characters are stripped to only the very core of their personalities. You're only given the surface of these characters and what makes them so important. I feel that the character that suffers most from the lack of general explanation is Skull Knight. If you haven't seen the Golden Age Trilogy or read the manga you may have absolutely no idea who he is, why he is there, and what his goal is. However, this can only subtract from the story so much, as every character in Berserk is absolutely amazing, even if you aren't getting all of the characterization and development that they are originally given. A slight nitpick I have is that Guts looks much more slim and generally less menacing (and much less handsome) than he does in other adaptations. I did genuinely love Puck, though. He's a great source of comedic relief and I almost feel like being animated does him much more justice than being in a still panel.\\n\\n\r\n3D animation is seemingly becoming more widespread in anime as a medium as time passes, as it is an efficient way to save money. Though the animation in Berserk 2016 is low effort, crude, and generally visually displeasing. It's even difficult to convey emotion in the characters faces when the animation is so stiff and awkward. Most of the time they almost have a completely blank expression, like a doll. It took a very long time for me to get used to the animation, and even then I couldn't help but be bamboozled by some of the more wonky looking scenes.  I particularly think the shading is awful, it sticks out like a sore thumb on top of the 3D models. Speaking of models, they are reused over and over and over again throughout the course of 12 episodes. It's nearly impossible to go through the series without seeing a character that looks identical to one you saw an episode ago, or maybe even a few scenes ago. There are some points where you can spot the same model several times in one frame. Something that may have gone over many people's heads if you weren't observant enough is that the models sometimes even clip into each other in some scenes, which is unforgivable. The cinematography is also something that works against the directors intent. With CG animation, camera angles that wouldn't usually be possible become possible. This is something that should be used as an advantage, but ends up being distracting and unnecessary. The use of slanted and spinning camera angles are severely overused. The moments where the animation transitions from 3D to hand drawn are some of the best and most memorable moments of the show, sadly, this also leaves you wishing that the entirety of the show was hand drawn.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design is one of the more faulty aspects of Berserk 2016. For people that actively followed the show during it's air time, you almost definitely ran into the infamous \"CLANG\" sound effect somewhere outside of anime itself. The sound design was definitely at it's worst in the earlier episodes, from the complete overuse of music in general, to overly compressed sounds effects. The OST takes more away from the quality of the show than it gives. Most of the OST doesn't really fit Berserk at all, it just gives off the feeling that Berserk is nothing more than a silly action series. Music is also played at very awkward times, and may not even fit the tone of the scene being portrayed. This doesn't mean that the entirety of the soundtrack is bad, though. The new remixed version of \"Hai Yo\" by Susumu Hirasawa is very good (but slightly overused), and I particularly liked the remixed version of \"My Brother\" from the Golden Age Trilogy. Surprisingly the voice acting is very good, considering some of the seiyuu's have a relatively blank slate. \\n\\n\r\nBerserk 2016 definitely has massive flaws. It's very hard to re-create something as beloved as Berserk and satisfy the expectations of every fan, but sometimes I thought to myself, \"Are they even trying?\" or, \"If only a studio with a larger budget or a better sense of direction could have picked this up.\" Regardless, as someone who loves Berserk nearly more than any other series in the anime and manga medium, and has waited through the painfully long hiatuses between new releases, I can't help enjoying it. It was almost like a love-hate relationship, many times I wanted to drop the show because I couldn't stand to see the less than mediocre treatment it was getting, but I couldn't keep myself from watching the next new episode every time it aired. What I'm most concerned about is people that are new to the Berserk series. Is the quality of Berserk 2016 turning off new fans that haven't read the source material? I certainly hope not. If you haven't already done so, please do yourself a favor and go read the manga. Even if you aren't a fan of reading manga, if you're just a tiny bit interested in Berserk it's definitely worth your time to go and check it out. Hopefully you will enjoy it just as much as I do.\\n",

The story plot isn't your typical something taken out from some MMORPG genre, it all focuses on man very sin of hatred and lies, where it was combine in a formof a dark action , horror and fantasy. Here the church is the antagonist and the only goods guys is an antihero who goes by the name of Guts. It was also not a typical good versus evil but a kind of bad versus evil, so in my book , it's a 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt, ok, the art was bad, but I can forgive it, but what I don't like was Puck being naked, now what the puck (and I do mean \"PucK\") was the original creator MIura Kentaro think of adding an image of child porn in the form of \"Puck?\"Geeeez, ok so the fanservice was tone downed so no nipples and hairy pussies to seen from Luca, Farness, Casca and Nina, ok it's understandable, and no dick fanservice from Griffith either (can I say that?) , but still even if Pucks nakedness was tone down it really doesn't look right  in this anime, cu'z she or he epitomize every pedophile's dream. So , poor 3 for this part.\\n\\n\r\nSound, it's good especially when the soundtrack fit's well with the anime's genre. Also every character's voice did matched up very well. Though I may have give this category a good 7....Casca's lines were a bit annoying , since all she does was moan, in a grandma's tone, EEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHH!!!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, I may have give it a good 7 , but unfortunately, it would be fair for me to say anything else since they're the same character from the first anime, so jut let it be a 7. sinc ethere is the 2nd season to go for it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, well it was great , IMO, and I'm looking forward for the 2nd season, it was really worthwhile watching it , there isn't an episode that one would find it boring. So in its overall it's a great 9, and I have nothing more to say.\\n\\n\r\nGuts OUT! \\n",

            "content": "As a huge Berserk fan, I'm trying not to let my disgust with this anime go overboard. For the most part, I'm pretty sure I stay impartial in my review.\r\nStory:\r\nThe first mistake is skipping the Lost Children arc. In doing so, viewers with no idea what Berserk is are left wondering what's really happening. What's the goal? It isn't very clear for many episodes what the intended goal is for Guts, and it's only about 4 episodes in that we're introduced to characters with a legitimate purpose. To engage in this issue further, however, imagine you had only seen the Berserk movies (which I highlyrecommend) and you went straight into this. It's evident there was a time-skip. This can't be shouldered by quick, dreamy flashbacks. There's a reason Miura wrote it as he did. It couldn't have been done any other way. Or, rather, it couldn't have been done WELL any other way.\\n\\n\r\nSo really, the first parts of this anime are only accessible for fans of the manga. However, fans of the manga won't appreciate the schlock that is the first episode. Right off the bat, Guts is shown destroying a Tree Ent that is oversized in its manga depiction. Guts clearly cannot win, but with one measly strike, he does something borderline magical. Fans of the manga know that Guts is a good fighter but he wins with cunning swordsmanship. There's a 'power creep,' so to speak, that is very subtle and on a slow incline. There are enemies that Guts can easily tear apart and then others that overpower him. Those that overpower him take time and effort to defeat. We see this happen later in the show, but anyone who doesn't know the seriousness of this effect will not care because in the first episode we see him lay waste to a fantastical creature that is far more threatening than anything else in the show. This takes all tension away for later sections of the show effectively 'effing' the pacing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, while discussing pacing, holy cow is it bad. I'll reiterate this in the Sound section as well, but holy cow is it horrid. Scenes jump around, music is cut off, this is a real mess. I don't think anyone knew what they were doing when storyboarding, but that's a given considering the same animation team worked on Teekyuu. Anyone who has seen that anime knows exactly what I'm getting at.\\n\\n\r\nThe story carries itself well enough later on in the show but it's bogged down by a lot of nonsense. The pacing is so poor, like unbelievably so, and all I want to do is strangle whoever thought it was a good idea to cut some of the most moving scenes short within this work. The Tower of Conviction arc isn't one of my favorite arcs in Berserk but it has some moments that earn themselves respect within the narrative, and the team who worked on this anime seemed to ignore some saving moments.\\n\\n\r\nI can't go full negative on Story, though. I can't say that things worked, persay, but I can say that I enjoy the narrative of Berserk and this arc enough that seeing it animated, and represented in this medium (albeit poorly) still earns itself some credit. I mean, at least my sister thought it was cool, and now we're going to watch the movies and she'll read the manga, so it did SOMETHING good if she can find it enjoyable as a newcomer, right?\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nYikes, I had hope for this despite it's 3DCG production. I thought Ajin did a great job with its animation and figured Berserk had the same potential, but then I learned what other anime the production company had worked on. At that point, it had all gone downhill. Even the 2D sections (mostly non-important characters) were stilted and weak. Ajin had humbling combat sequences thanks to great sound design and animation, but Berserk couldn't even handle itself with good combat sequences. Some of them looked alright but most of the time it was cheesy and lame. Underwhelming is a good word for it.\\n\\n\r\nDamn, though. There's so much wrong and as I type this review further I keep coming through each section and writing even more. For instance, even the pacing effects the artistic choices. When the brand is visible from the Tower it isn't shown what it is but Guts is panicking, then a later scene it's shown when the effect is gone. Why was this done? Who story boarded this? Did anyone not read how it functioned in the manga? It was a single page, completely petrifying the reader. All of these little things add up to this giant pile of crap.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI figured Shiro Sagisu would have been able to produce a soundtrack as powerful as the animated films but that turned out to be wrong. The direction of the whole anime is very... adolescent. It tries to be cool rather than what Berserk is: horrible, depressing, but filled with an overabundance of hope. This was captured in the whole of the Berserk trilogy films and is completely vacant in Berserk (2016). There's even this horn call that Guts has when he jumps on screen sometimes and it's absolutely horrendous. Man, it's just crazy how much Murphy's Law took hold on this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne big point of discussion I've seen is the sound of the Dragon Slayer. Sure, it's a bit strange, but I found it somewhat neat. What really bothered me was how repetitive the sounds became. It was at that point that I became tired of the sound chosen for it and wished they did something different. In all honesty, it didn't need an unrealistic sound. It just had to sound like a sword, but bigger.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThings function fairly well in this area. The problem isn't so much the characters but how they are handled through pacing and character themes (so, again, some more music discussion.) I don't really think I can discuss this much further considering I've already said so much elsewhere. The characters here aren't fantastic considering Guts is portrayed as an overpowered in the first episode, then as a slow in the third (having an embarrassingly long discussion with an apostle made me think of how the Gantz anime is all talk and no shooting) and then having characters like Puck take on full comedy relief despite his character during this arc remaining quite serious.\\n\\n\r\nPuck has always been a fun character in Berserk but he didn't become this comedic until later arcs. For some reason, they decided to make him really 'funny' early on but all it does is take away. Again, I think the problem comes with the direction this anime has. It's adolescant and childish. It does certain things in its production that are made for teleivison, when this is a narrative made for film. It has to follow a more open set of rules, but television productions are more restricted, especially in Japan. So, the show is made much lighter despite it needing to be grimy and disgusting. This whole arc needed to have the same tone as the third Berserk movie (something this film did perfectly) immediately the show needed to be dark and brooding, and Puck could have a few jokes here and there but the show needed to keep that theme of pure filth.\\n\\n\r\nI know I'm derailing a little in the character section but let me continue just for one more paragraph about the overarching theme. This part of Berserk, along with the previous unanimated arc Lost Children, is supposed to be disgusting not just for Guts but for the world within Berserk, too. It means we can get to comedy and stuff after Griffith returns. Why? Because in the lore that's the purpose of the Hawk, to bring order and safety to the people of Midland and, as Griffith wants, the world. We needed a darker tone show to emphasize how the following arc is lighter for the world in Berserk and for our characters. I hate Griffith as much as the next guy but he, for the most part, sets the tone int he entirety of Berserk from the Golden Age, Tower of Conviction, and beyond. This narrative needed to be like carrion so that his arrival is like the spark of (false) hope that everyone wants in Berserk. This anime didn't do that, and now we're stuck with it. If these anime productions finish off by 2018, then maybe we can hope that in 10 years we'll get this portion reanimated. But, until then, here's what we have.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nSo, I suppose I could have discussed the above here, but I'll just say this: Many glaring issues arise in Berserk (2016) but there was something I kept telling my fiancee while it aired. \"It's Berserk, and I'm going to watch it anyway.\" As it is, I enjoyed it enough for one watch. I wish this were an amazing production but, if we're being honest, most anime (or any media production nowadays) suck. We just got unlucky that Berserk (2016) ended up being one such production. I don't have high hopes (or any) when it comes to Berserk (2017), but I'm excited for the manga to come off hiatus for a short while, so that's something to look forward to.\\n\\n\\n\r\n((If you liked this review, check out my other reviews by going to my profile and clicking the 'reviews' tab.

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: If you have not watched Berserk (1997) or have read the manga I strongly urge that you do as Berserk (2016) is set after the events of Berserk (1997) a.k.a The Golden Age arc and will spoil many of the events from the Golden Age arc/Berserk (1997).\r\nAfter nearly 20 years, Berserk-one of the greatest mangas ever made-finally gets another adaptation. After recently reading 300+ chapters of the manga as well as watching Berserk (1997) I was incredibly excited to find that a new Berserk adaption had come out which would finally cover the Black Swordsman arc (aka the Conviction arc). I was ecstatic tosay the least.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then I cried.\\n\\n\r\nWhile certainly not the worst anime I have seen Berserk (2016) was definitely one of the most disappointing anime's I have seen in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd not just because of the horrible animation.\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Now branded for death and destined to be hunted by demons until the day he dies, Guts embarks on a journey to defy such a gruesome fate, as waves of beasts relentlessly pursue him. Steeling his resolve, he takes up the monstrous blade Dragonslayer and vows to exact vengeance on the one responsible, hunting down the very man he once looked up to and considered a friend.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the way, he encounters some unlikely allies, such as a small elf named Puck, and Isidro, a young thief looking to learn swordsmanship from the former mercenary. As the ragtag group slowly comes together after having decided to join Guts in his quest, they will face incredible danger unlike anything they have ever experienced before.\\n\\n\r\nHow you can fuck up a story as great as Berserk is beyond me. How something so rushed and poorly written was considered acceptable is absolutely appalling. To give some perspective they barely manage to cram around 4-5 (I think) chapters worth of content into ONE episode, ONE! And that's not all, not by a long shot.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does Berserk (2016) completely rush through the story but it also skips the Lost Children arc which many believe to be one of the best arcs in the manga. I get that 12 episodes is not a whole lot to work with but you should have used the first 12 episodes to establish the setting, characters and should have left the arc they did adapt for the next season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story is a rushed mess which skips entire chapters and leaves out crucial pieces of information that would help greatly to link Berserk 2016 to its previous adaptation.\\n\\n\r\n\"Art\" 2/10\\n\\n\r\nNow we come to Berserk (2016) biggest criticism, its animation. Now I don't have a problem with CGI, when done properly it can look really good and can make an anime better rather than worse. A prime example of good CGI animation would be Ajin whose CGI is fluid, detailed and grounded. But there are some things that just can't be done in CGI, one of these being Berserk.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off the character models look terrible, Puck's chestnut form looks completely out of place and Guts' head looks too angular. Another problem with the CGI character models is that their lips do not sync properly with what they are saying. Instead of looking like they are actually saying something they instead slowly open and close their mouths making it all look like a really ameture video game cutscene. The studio also decided to add really horrible lines in the shadows that don't move with the character and completely take you out of the anime whenever a character moves. And to top it off all of the women in Berserk (one of the most explicit, mature mangas of all time) don't have nipples...ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!?\\n\\n\r\nSadly that isn't even the worst part of the CGI, the worst part would have to be the demons that attack Guts at night. You wouldn't believe the look I had on my face when I saw the demons for the first time, my face turned into that of the crimson behelit with tears of blood streaming down my face. The CGI for the demons is even worse than the rest of the CGI, as they look like the CGI monsters from the Deltora Quest anime but worse (btw Deltora Quest was made in 2007...I'll just let that sink in). To put it shortly the CGI for the demons is absolute garbage and whoever did the CGI for the demons should be fired.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now I'll move on to the 2D animation, one of the only good things in this anime (although I wouldn't call it good). While the animation itself isn't terrible there are definitely parts that make the animation look very cheap. For an example whenever there is a close-up of a 2D animated character walking towards the camera they do this very cheap looking bobbing effect that makes the character look like a puppet being bounced up and down.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the CGI animation is garbage. Whilst it may have worked for a much more grounded and, dare i say \"realistic\" anime, it certainly doesn't work for something as over the top as Berserk.\\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one thing possibly worse than the animation it would definitely be the sound design of Berserk (2016). Whenever an enemy hits the Dragon Slayer (Guts' Sword) it sounds like the crowbar collision sound effect from Half Life. The sound effect is so bad it's turned into a meme.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that but the battle music in Berserk (2016) is very forgettable, generic heavy metal music that sounds very out of place and really takes you out of the battle (not that I could get into it in the first place but still), it's almost as if it is screaming \"Look at how cool and badass I am\" but instead comes off as annoying and pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nBut that isn't to say that all the music is bad (if that were the case it would get a 1/10) as the OP song (Inferno) is actually fairly good imo. Its intense and fast paced with some slow moments here and there (just like Berserk) and it gets you really hyped up for some demon slaying action. The only downside to the OP is that it completely spoils the events of the Golden Age arc in a rather tasteless fashion. As for the ED I really don't like it. It's very lacklustre visually and isn't a particularly memorable song. This is one of the times where I feel that the original ED from the previous anime would work pretty well for the sequel and again would help connect the two together.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if there is anything worse than the animation in Berserk (2016) it's probably the sound. While the OP is pretty good just about everything else in the department is either generic and forgettable, or just straight up trash.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10\\n\\n\r\nProbably the best aspect of Berserk (2016) and is still done poorly. Guts in the manga is a complete asshole when he is the Black Swordsman. He is rude, unforgiving, careless and full of hatred. He battles demons both physically and mentally every second of his life. In the anime he's an edgey cosplayer trying desperately to come off as cool or badass but instead comes off as cringey. Throughout the anime we get brief flashbacks to the Golden Age arc to give us a glimpse into Guts' backstory in order to make him seem more interesting which may have worked...if the movies or Berserk (1997) didn't exist. Because Berserk (2016) tries to appeal to fans both old and new (even though it advertises itself as a sequel) the character of Guts is rushed and ruined thanks to terrible storytelling, direction and pacing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters e.g Farnese, Serpico, Isidro etc aren't as bad as they aren't fleshed out as much as Guts was...except for Puck. Berserk (2016) ruined Puck, as I mentioned before in the \"Art\" section of this review Puck looks awful in CGI. Without 2D animation Puck in his Chestnut form doesn't have the same creative freedoms he had in the manga and because of this his jokes go from humorous to borderline annoying. As for voice acting aside from Puck and Isidro everyone sounds acceptable. I mean, I would have liked Serpico to have a sleeker more sly voice but thats about it. Puck on the other hand sounds off, I wish he didn't sound so high pitch and as for Isidro I wish he was voice acted by a kid and not some pre-teen going through puberty.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst not nearly as bad as some of Berserk (2016) other areas the characters are a far cry from their original interpretations.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Berserk (2016) was a massive disappointment. At best its mediocre and at worst it's complete garbage. If you are a big Berserk fan and really want to see the Black Swordsman arc animated then you may find some enjoyment from this. But I for one can only hope that the studio learns from the mistakes made in this season and (at the very least) tries to fix the problems with Berserk (2016) in the next season.",

            "content": "Berserk (2016) is a continuation of the Golden Age arc of Kentaro Miura's Berserk story, which has previously been adapted twice already into the anime medium. First was the 1997 series, which is among my personal favourites, mostly because of the great story with compelling characters, but also because of it's old school animation style and great soundtrack. In 2012 followed a movie trilogy, that is due to it's decision to use CGI and underwhelming scenes, that I felt were far more impactful in the original series, not my prefered version of the story. Looking at the aesthetic choices, that were made, Berserk (2016) feelsmore like a continuation of the movie trilogy.\\n\\n\r\nNow to get the elephant out of the room; Berserk (2016) is no feast for the eyes. The movies managed to make CG-animation work to some degree, unfortunately this series is not capable to do so. Hardcore Berserk manga fans pretty much saw this series as an insult, which lead to a bunch of overly dramatic comments flooding MAL forums on the topic of this series. Personally I didn't take it as badly. To be honest, I don't think there is a way you could make Miura's artstyle justice in a weekly episodic series; there just isn't time and money for that. Even if Berserk (2016) did end up a visual feast like Fate/Zero or Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works, there would probably still be a few people saying, that it didn't do the manga justice.\\n\r\nHowever, I won't disagree with those, who say that it would have been better, if there was no CGI involved at all. It's a shame actually, because when the series does non-CG animation, it actually looks pretty good. Unfortunately those moments are rare. Most of the time it feels like you are looking at cutscenes from Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm or something. But to give credit, when credit is due; in some major events, even the CGI is pretty good. For example the apostle Guts is fighting in episode 11 (I don't consider this a spoiler) is animated pretty well.\\n\r\nWhat some of the offended Berserk manga fans won't address, or likely won't agree with me, is that the story quality is in decline. I'll come to this some time later. First I'll address another complaint; that they skipped a lot.\\n\r\nPersonally that didn't bother me too much. First some of the earlier chapters of the manga still weren't adapted into anime format. Secondly the Lost Children arc is missing as well. This doesn't bother me, because it's basically all manga filler; things happen, but the status quo doesn't change. There's no significant character development or plot movement. It's all just side stories. I did enjoy them, but I could also do without them. \\n\r\nNow to the actual story of the 2016 anime; Guts gets tangled up into the business of some zealous crusaders, because the love of his life and recently gotten mentally challenged person, due to a personal fear of her's becoming reality, runs away and one thing leads to another. What affected my enjoyment of this premise is, that the idea didn't feel particularly fresh or unique. We've already had a fair share of religious extremists, who were portrayed blinded by their faith and one-dimensional in fiction. Another thing that got weaker with post-Golden Age arc Berserk is how the characters just aren't as interesting anymore. Golden Age arc had the strong underlying themes of identity and ambition, that were well reflected in the character arc's of it's leads. What can later Berserk offer you in that category? Guts becomes a pretty static character; hellbent to resolve what transpired in the climax of the Golden Age arc, his biggest appeal is the fact, that he has inhuman powers and mows down demons on a daily basis. Caska is now mentally 2 years old and also pretty static. Miura has tried to get some more variety into the series by introducing more characters, but none of them really feel all too interesting. Lady Farnese feels like a patchwork, that Miura only figured out what to do with, after introducing her. Isidoro is the fighting shounen main character, who wants to be become a fighting seinen main character by clinging on to Guts, hoping he'd learn something. And then there's a bunch of other characters, who are somewhat relevant to this anime series all through, but aren't really interesting and I wanted to get killed, because they kept getting put in dangerous situations, but Miura decided to plot protect them because reasons. \\n\r\nAll in all it's still a fun story, but it lacks the feeling of completeness and interesting characters, that the Golden Age arc had.\\n\\n\r\nPlot (50%):            6/10\\n\r\nCharacters (30%): 4/10\\n\r\nArt (10%):              2/10\\n\r\nSoundtrack (10%): 6/10\\n\\n\r\nScore: 5/10",

            "content": "Berserk is a Dark Fantasy that is set in Medieval Setting. The show is a continuation of the golden Age arc. Which had its 3 movie adaptation as well as unfaithful manga adaptation in 1997.\r\nThis part of the series features guts journey to find Cassca after events of Golden Age.\r\nThis particular anime has its ups and downs especially due to its unique form of art and animation as well as its execution but I will talk about this more in depth later on.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is simply amazing, the world is a great representation of the medieval times filled with fantasy touch to them. The grotesquescenes and dark vibes along with great story telling make this a masterful piece to watch and read. This anime adaptation follows the original story(manga) to a high degree. Well although it skips out on \"minor\" events in order to progress to main story. But this does not feel like pacing is rushed making it a very good watch. Because at the end of the day we all love to see guts swing his big sword at least once per episode. Some key events are changed in a minimal way mainly due to censorship like \"child and mother\" in the conviction arc.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\r\nFirstly the animation of this particular series is \"ok\". The Most noticeable issue is all the combat scenes in early episodes of badly made CGI. It looks extremely \"fake\". Although this definitely improves over the future episodes. This can be clearly seen as soon as whole conviction arc starts.\\n\r\nAs for combat animation in conviction arc, some scenes are great the combat looks very fluid, this with the dark toned art that has been blended with CGI animation \\n\r\nThe art is probably what makes up for majority of the animation the line styled shading adds to this \"Dark Fantasy\" theme. The use of crosshatching technique really defines the atmosphere to surroundings. \\n\r\nArt suffers sometimes with character appearances as it makes some look off model this is partially due to CGI being used.\\n\\n\r\n6/10 \\n\\n\r\nMusic, and Sounds:\\n\r\nProbably the most surprising element of this series. Normally when watching any anime I see the opening and do not pay major detail to any other sounds within the series however the music in Berserk is epic. This is probably the first show where I loved the opening, ending and next episode preview music.\\n\r\nSounds are well timed for each scene, they definitely set the correct vibe for each scene that has to come helping the crosshatching art portray current situation as well as paint the berserk world in its dull colours.\\n\r\nThe sword slashing sounds are ones that confuse me most. It sounds as if someone was bowling not swinging large chunk of metal. \\n\r\nVoice acting is on on par with representing each character. Especially the character of guts.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI'm general most character models are on point. Some look bit off, MC looks very detailed and straight on point also he is as bad ass as it gets!\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nFinally I will simply share my personal opinion about this. I am huge berserk fan, I own DVD and Manga collection for every volume up to date (really hard to get nowadays). I really enjoyed this show as a whole it gave me what I always wanted and that is having my favorite berserk arc animated the Conviction arc. I really like how I get to have very close adaptation, to the original source material so I can re experience all those epic moments the manga had to offer. I definitely consider this to be far more superior version over the old 1997 adaptation simply due to huge upgrade in art and animation over almost 2 decades that these shows have been apart. Especially the following source material as 1997 \"conclusions\" had made some blunders for future continuation. \\n\\n\r\nI gave this show a 8/10 and cannot await to get some of this amazing show.\\n\\n\r\n(For those who gave this show anywhere below 5 you guys are clearly mad because you see CGI, I understand the argument that this is not best CGI execution to ever exist but nonetheless this is a very solid show even if the art and animation are Mediocre. As someone who followed berserk from 2004, I feel that some people completely disregard all the positives and great things about this show simply because their fantasies never got met.\\n\r\nI am just glad we got an adaptation after such a long wait and I appreciate the studio to take up a task of producing a show that is not another ecchi harem for free money grabs.\\n\r\nIf we look at anime with 6.5 scores and compare it to this, some do not come even relatively close to this show.)",

            "content": "*English is not my native language, so I apologize for the mistakes.*\r\nIt's really hard to talk about Berserk 2016 witouth saying something bad about it. This anime could enter in the category ''Worst animes of these latest years''. In all these days, my frustation was bigger and bigger. Why I have to suffer watching 12 episodes of a beautiful story beign ruining by bad direction and animation? \r\nHistory and development:\r\n2 of 10.\r\nIf you are a fan of the manga, you will notice that the way they direct the anime was a SHIT. Even if you didn't read the manga and you've only watch the oldanime or the movies, you will see that this anime looks like something directed by a 10 years old kid. Serie changes constantly of rithm and scenary very fast, given short time to the spectator to thinks with deteails what's happening. I'm not joking when I say that the first episode of the serie skips like 100 chapters of the manga. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\n1 of 10. \\n\\n\r\nNothing good cames with this animation. Poorly use of CGI, that fails when it tries to express the faces of scared, sadness, and madness that the characters have. The angles and movements of the camera are pretty bad, so much that they can even annoy . \\n\\n\r\nThe drawings weren't really that bad, they respect the style of Miura and they put a detail on lines to make it looks more like a manga, The problem is that the animation a lot of money o have made, and this show didn't have it. Moves are really cuts, and that makes the only shorts moments where we can't see the awful CGI, a completely shit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n5 of 10.\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here. The characters are the same as always, but their developemt in the serie is nule. This time was really hard for me to be in love with characters like Guts, because he has one of the best developent that I see on an manga, but here, that doesn't exist.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\n7 of 10.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, music isn't really that bad. I mean, the OST it's ok. It's not memorable, but nice to hear. Althought, the only really good song of the serie is ''Hai Yo'' of Susumu Hirasawa; the composer of the 1997 anime and the anime opening. Besides, the opening is a shit, that It tries too hard to make Berserk to look like a shonen anime, when it's a seinen serie, and the ending was really nice for my ears, it shows the melancholic side of Berserk.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score:\\n\\n\r\n2 of 10.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not a memorable serie. It has nothing good, it's an insult to the original manga of Kentarou Miura and for the fans of Berserk. I don't recommend this to anyone. It was just a serie that we thought It would be great but It becomes to be a shit. Hope one day Japan brought a better adaptation of Berserk like the 1997 one.",

I also want to add that people need to remember that Guts isa little different now as he is low-key traumatised by the whole Griffith incident and so (in a good way) Guts is a lot more mysterious and \"cool\" but still tough as always ahehehe.",

            "content": "This show was probably most popular in the anime community for making fun of it's shitty CGI and the \"CLANG!\" sound that Gut's sword makes in the first couple of episodes. The internet hate machine picked up on it and then went on a rampage of unfairly judging the show, making claims like \"It's not just the art, it's the pacing and direction\" when being called out that they just don't like the CGI, and acting as if the show is an abomination in the Berserk franchise.\r\nTo get it of the way, yes, the art is absolutely awful. The CGI looks worse than CGI showsin the late 90s at times, and the complaints that it \"looks like a PS2 game\" are actually unfair in that many PS2 games looked better than the CGI in the show. The show also cuts between 2D and 3D scenes, and the 2D scenes always look excellent- why the heck couldn't they just do that for the entire series? That all being said, the CGI seems to improve a bit as the show goes on and the big fights are always breathtaking and fun to behold.\\n\\n\r\nThe show basically makes up for the art in every other way, however. Susumu Hirasawa is back with a great, \"Berserk sounding\" score, the characters are all incredibly true to the manga, Mozgus is suitably over the top and insane, and most importantly it \"feels\" like Berserk. I still got the feel of absolute cosmic dread throughout the series, and it doesn't shy away from the disturbing Berserk stuff that makes Berserk, Berserk.\\n\\n\r\nI can't help but think though that my knowledge of the manga may have filled in some of the character gaps that may have been present. I saw some complaints that the show moved too quick and people didn't know what was going on, but honestly, if you're coming into this show fresh without watching any other Berserk related media you're going to be lost. It takes place during the third main arc of the series where earth shattering events have already occurred.\\n\\n\r\nI was afraid that all the fan bitching was going to lead to the show not being continued, but it looks like despite all the whining people are watching the show, big time. The general anime audience seems to really enjoy it, and we're getting a season 2 next year! With the movies, show and new Berserk game coming out, it's a great time to be a Berserk fan after a pretty much 20 year drought of outside media.",

            "content": "Berserk (2016) Review\r\nStory (7/10) Good\r\nThe Story for Berserk written by Kentarou Miura is probably the one of the if not the best written seinen stories I've read. The anime adaption tries to adapted the Tower of Conviction Arc which is considered the 3rd major arc in the over Berserk manga. Did they do the adaptation justice? No... fuck no.. but was it bad? Nah it wasn't bad from an adaptation standpoint as far as focusing on the Tower of Conviction arc I felt they adapted the story decently although since this animation studio is the same one that brought us the trilogy movie you wouldassume they would try to explain and connect the trilogy movie straight into this one and by skipping the Black Swordsman arc they kind of hurt them just a tad bit in my opinion. Episode 1 covers chapters 95, 96 and 119 lol who's fucking decision was it to skip so much content in between this? I would give the overall story a 10 if all of the story was fucking present, but what ever I digress. The point is in my opinion it doesn't absolutely ruin the experience of Berserk from a story standpoint missing all the content this animation studio decent to omit. The only piece of content really missing from this adaptation that I felt really should not have been skipped was the little time Guts actually spent with Casca before he left at the start of the anime. This anime starts off with (by episode 4) Guts return to Rickert, the Blacksmith and his Daughter after leaving for two years. Something important happen while he was there and before he left which is directly connected to that floating fetus that was stalking Guts and protecting Casca for the majority of this Tower of Conviction Arc. Anime only watchers I wouldn't be surprised were probably confused with that things presence all the time, where the fuck it came from and wtf it is, but I'm sure if they assume and think hard enough they can figure out what it is, but the at the end of the day it's sad that they have to do that when the manga explained wtf that thing is where the fuck it came from and why it was doing what it was doing when this anime decided to just skip over it's explanation and true debut to the series entirely. The fact that you see at the end who makes his appearance back into the series and reborn, is also directly connected to that fetus but what ever. Overall it's not a very good adaptation but it's not bad because anime only watchers when I hear their impressions of it like it.. but that's only because they don't know what they are missing. Overall it's a 7 which means it's good (but I couldn't give it my true approval as a Berserk manga fan idk how any manga fan could).\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (5/10) Mediocre\\n\\n\r\nThis is obviously the section that has the most controversy over the entire anime adaptation. The CG animation.... SIGH... to simply look pass it is so god damn hard. ESPECIALLY IF YOU'VE READ THE MANGA seeing as Kentarou Miura's artstyle for his manga is probably the best and art style I've ever fucking seen (yes I think his art style beats Takehiko Inoue's Vagabond but not by much). Either way even the hand drawn scenes are quite mediocre but it's not the worst CG or hand drawn animation I've seen. Kingdom's CG animation is still the worst I've seen and I as far as hand drawn there's quite a hand full. So can this category ruin the experience? If your an anime only watcher... not necessarily seeing as this is new content for you and watching Guts do bad ass things you've never seen him do will still get you hyped. But if you are a manga reader.. no this obviously does not any of Kentarou's originally drawn scenes justice and I only really got enjoyment out of the action scenes because of the background music that played during these pathetically adapted action scenes but I'll talk about that in that section.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) Great\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is the only section in this review I can say is great. The animation studio definitely chose some good ass background music to play during this entire adaptation. From the opening, to the sound effects, to the background action and vibe changing scenes like Hai yo oh (which got abused! But I love this OST so i didn't mind that it was a bit overused), Blood and Guts for depressing and important scenes and let's not forget Dragon Slayer! Dragon Slayer and Hai yo oh in particular kept my enjoyment score away from a 4/10 which I'll talk about more in that section. The voice actors for Guts, Puck and Isidro I was not too fond of from when I first heard (especially since I watched the OG anime and movie trilogy in dub) but I got used to them they aren't bad everyone else's voice fit their character from the get go for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nThe characters that are in this adaption were adapted very good in my opinion. Although like I said before a whole god dam arc and multiple volumes are skipped over to get to this Tower of Conviction arc it does miss some character development to Guts also his struggle between leaving Casca with Rickert as we went off to become the Black Swordsman is characterization missing but not too much seeing as though the Blacksmith explains his struggles to him face to face for the viewer to catch up on. But still you shouldn't have to rely on future events to explain something you didn't feel like adapting it doesn't work out for every situation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10) Mediocre\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment for this section wasn't bad, i wasn't frowning the entire time watching this adaptation because i think it's obviously don't hold this adaptation to any high regard what so ever but I wasn't hyped and smiling while watching scenes I've read that I considered hype and amazing, which I obviously assume if it was my first time seeing said hyped scenes I would feel differently about it but that's besides the point because I've read and watch other series and I'll still be hyped watching said hyped scene when animated so it's definitely the animation studio not doing that scene justice in my opinion. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10) Fair\\n\r\nMore Specifically (6.80/10) Fair+\\n\\n\r\nI knew coming into the anime adaptation that I wasn't going to enjoy it nearly as much as I enjoyed reading the manga. I definitely wouldn't so I hate this adaption because the music alone was reason enough for me to sit back and enjoy what little I could enjoy out of this adaptation especially since I know what Arc is coming up in the 2017 anime. Overall I wouldn't consider this a good adaptation but it was fair but I'll say it once more I can not recommend watching it before reading the manga because I can't vouche for such a decision and I'm glad I sat down and read the manga beginning to where it is now before even touching this adaptation.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nBerserk (2016) (or just Berserk for short) has this \u201csoup\u201d that one of the characters tries to eat. A soup filled with sludge, unidentifiable remnants, and a finger or two.\r\nIt looked downright nasty; just thinking about it makes me want to puke. It reminds me of the cough medicine my mother used to give me when I was kid. She would fill the cap with the purple, foul-smelling liquid, hoping that I would down the grape-flavored concoction.\r\nI hated the taste. To the point that I would put the medicine in my mouth, shake my headat her, and spit it all back out into her cupped hands. Unsurprisingly, I got sick quite a lot.\\n\\n\r\nBerserk does not provide a cure for anything, and it doesn\u2019t exactly \u201ctaste\u201d horrible. But it certainly is not the easiest anime to digest \u2013 in more ways than one.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nBerserk follows Guts, the infamous Black Swordsman, a mysterious man who wanders the world alone. As he hunts demons, and the demons hunt him, Guts embarks on a journey to see through his personal vendetta against the man who wronged him \u2013 all while protecting the only person he holds dear.\\n\\n\r\nWhat cannot be understated is how violent the anime is. While today the depiction of killing and the like is normal, Berserk scoffs at such pleasantries. Rape is common. Torture is expected. Gore is inescapable. The more the audience watches the anime, the more they become desensitized to the burning bodies, the hanging entrails, and the nonconsenting advances.\\n\\n\r\nThis presentation of a variety of vile behavior is not something that the show does just for shock value or just for entertainment. True, it is eye opening when the flesh of a person melts away when they are consumed by a jelly monster. And, sure, Guts smashing in half a handful of knights with one swing of his sword is hard not to appreciate. But a more important point exists beyond the immediate reactions one may have.\\n\\n\r\nOne of Berserk\u2019s major motifs is the notion of sin. As can be gleaned from these couple of paragraphs, a lot of that is constantly going on. However, it\u2019s not only the sins themselves that matter but how they affect the world and its people.\\n\\n\r\nIt gets at this direction through its religious incorporations. Farnese and her Holy Knights. Father Mozgus and his purging inquisition. The monks, the prayers, and the scriptures. Throughout almost the entire season, religion and sin fight against one another as readily as Guts fights his enemies.\\n\\n\r\nIn this world, though, religion is painted in a very negative light. They keep food from the poor, they wrongly accuse people of crimes, and they believe that their grotesque actions are justified by God\u2019s words.\\n\\n\r\nOn the opposite end, sin is by no means deified. But it certainly looks more appealing or, if nothing else, relatable. Doing something for one\u2019s self versus for others. Taking part in instinctual desires like casual sex and simple survival. Fighting against conformity.\\n\\n\r\nThe pseudo-subplot of Nina \u201cversus\u201d Luca also serves Berserk\u2019s and these intentions. Nina, a very average person, does her best in this messed-up world. But, sometimes, she has thoughts of selfishness like wanting to abandon \u201cElaine\u201d or willing to let go of Luca. Luca, by contrast, is purely good, supporting the other women through body shielding and word-filled comfort. Where Nina represents the normalcy of sin in everyday people, Luca represents the notion that goodness, no matter how horrible it all may seem, will never truly die out.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the action and the plot arguably take precedence over these ideas, it\u2019s reassuring to see Berserk challenge the more conventional take on religion by saying, no, it\u2019s not as hunky-dory as one is led to believe.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the show\u2019s questionable and weak writing choices mire much of the narrative, quelling this message to a degree that the anime never intended.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, the anime includes instances of comedy. Puck using his \u201cabilities\u201d or Isidro hiding his erection are the show\u2019s attempts to, however slightly, offset the despair and the debauchery with laughter. But, since Berserk swings so far in the other direction, these moments are unnecessary at worst and jarring at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself also has problems. The first few episodes are there to establish the setting (a disease-ridden world swarmed with monsters) and introduce some of the main players (Guts, Farnese, etc.) Afterwards, though, the show doesn\u2019t know what to do. Guts\u2019s self-proclaimed mission to take out all the Apostles gets pushed aside, and the whole second half of the anime can be boiled down to \u201csave Casca for the four hundredth time.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis second point is interesting. Part of Berserk\u2019s goal is to depict Guts suffering. Not just on a physical level but on a mental one as well. So, when the anime depicts him losing Casca again. And again. And again. It starts to tax on the audience, too. So, while the plot is unsatisfying, it\u2019s purposefully done to relate to the main protagonist. Still, there are only so many times that Casca barely slipping through Guts\u2019s grasp can be considered a valid plot point.\\n\\n\r\nOther plot points are likewise not as sound.\\n\\n\r\nNear the end of the third episode, the anime depicts a large city rampant with troubles, the death of a king, and a young woman (who is calling out for Griffith) who will inherit her father\u2019s role \u2013 just as another nation begins their attack. Yet, afterwards, this city and this girl are never shown again, and that attacking nation (presumably it\u2019s them) only shows up twice more. Once as they tail Guts and once more right as Griffith is reborn.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole forgotten-man-turned-world-egg seems a bit more out there and a lot more convenient in regards to the narrative. Sure, the anime alluded to this weird creature in the shadows constantly in the second half of the season, but the explanation behind what he is and what he can do is shoved into a huge exposition scene, creating more confusion than answers.\\n\\n\r\nThe reunion between Guts and Casca lost momentum since it got cutoff way too early.\\n\\n\r\nDeath plops into the events without much care.\\n\\n\r\nNina and Joachim have a mishandled romance.\\n\\n\r\nThe list of poor plot points goes on and on and on.\\n\\n\r\nBerserk also relies way too much on sexual material. The horse-molestation scene with Farnese, the downright bizarre goat-worshipping fornication ritual, and the pressure-torture of women\u2019s breasts are the more prominent examples. But they quickly illustrate that, sometimes, the anime can go overboard with (consensual or not) sex.\\n\\n\r\nIt also has trouble maintaining moral ambiguity. Far too often, the evilness of the situation is overly obvious. Father Mozgus popping multiple arteries in his face or the constancy of men who are nothing more than degenerates leave little to interpret. Granted, insane priests and ugly rapists are nothing but evil, but, when the anime is trying to balance such weighty topics as religion and sin, its inability to use subtlety in delivering in its themes only hurts itself in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nAs it is, Berserk has a lot of meaningful ideas to deliver. It\u2019s unfortunate, then, that they are lost among the negatives that plague it for almost the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nArguably, where most people have issues with Berserk is in its artistic merit.\\n\\n\r\nThe quick spiel is that the anime chooses a three-dimensional approach, especially with its characters, for most of its run. An approach that ultimately falls flat (or rather bounces spherically off the sidewalk and into the street only for a car to then flatten it, but the idea is still the same).\\n\\n\r\nThe fairer spiel is that Berserk\u2019s look is not as awful as it may first appear to be.\\n\\n\r\nOn their own, the character designs, like that of Guts or Farnese, have a respectable level of detail and thought. Guts\u2019s spiky, black hair. The knives, bombs, and shoulder plates he wears. The billowing cape that hides his behemoth of a sword. Farnese, with her golden locks, dons pink-and-white armor. A figurative shield that protects her sadism with femininity and kindness.\\n\\n\r\nTheir designs (as well as those of the others) also take advantage of shadowing. Darker lines often blanket parts of their faces or necks, adding extra detail or depth to their normal looks.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the three-dimensional direction falls apart in its repetition, stiffness, and general lack of polish. Enemies or knights are just cloned one right after another. Most of the characters move in an animatronic style rather than with fluid, believable motions. And a lot of the designs that aren\u2019t the main cast tend to look either goofy or overly ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nBerserk does tease its audience with two-dimensional, highly detailed art very sparingly. A shot of Guts\u2019s grizzled face or an intimate scene between Luca and Jerome demonstrates what the anime could look like had the creators gone such a route. Whether it infuriates or complements the work is up for the viewer to decide, but it\u2019s not a stretch to say that the what-could-be is far better looking than the what-it-is.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, even the two-dimensional aspects are worrisome. Choppy sections are hard to watch, and weird still frames try for spookiness but only end up raising eyebrows.\\n\\n\r\nAt the minimum, the demonic and religious imagery, such as the skulls and the crosses, as well as the use of duller, darker colors (lots of grays, blacks, browns) create a bleak atmosphere that aligns with the anime\u2019s tone and content.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWhile Berserk\u2019s story and its art are not in the best of spots come the end of this first season, its characters are in a rather respectable place. Or at least, they are a lot stronger than whatever else the anime offers.\\n\\n\r\nAs the main protagonist, Guts stands as one of the most interesting members of the cast. The peculiarity of his character comes from a paradox of sorts: a lot is known about him, but not much is known about him.\\n\\n\r\nThat sounds weird, right? But it makes sense. Guts is a person whose past is mired in tragedy. It\u2019s what the anime shows through bits of his flashbacks: the massacre of his friends, the mental loss of his woman, the betrayal of his best friend. It\u2019s also what the anime shows on him: a missing arm, a shut eye, a massive weapon that symbolizes the burdens he carries.\\n\\n\r\nYet, the audience doesn\u2019t really know him. Those small snippets barely give any detail beyond what must be hypothesized, the non-tragic backstory moments are very few and far between, and his outward characteristics mean almost nothing to him as he wields and wears them all with ease.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what gives? What does Guts have going for him currently?\\n\\n\r\nDiscussed earlier, Berserk focuses a large deal on religion and sin. To this end, and biblically speaking, Guts is a walking antichrist. He views demons as \u201cmiracles.\u201d He mocks the church and their teachings. He cares very little for his own life and the lives of others.\\n\\n\r\nExpanding on this last point, Guts truly only cares about one person: Casca. The comparison is striking. Where Jesus would sacrifice himself to save all, Guts would murder everyone to save just one.\\n\\n\r\nHe has a similar revelation after visiting with the blacksmith. He chastises himself for going off on his own (presumably again) and leaving Casca alone when, in reality, she\u2019s all that matters to him. The first three episodes did not establish this motivation of his, so his thoughts and turnaround are not the most impactful. Still, he steels himself, ready to take out anyone and everyone that may stray onto his path.\\n\\n\r\nYet Guts\u2019s most important contribution as the antithesis to Christ is how he influences the people around him.\\n\\n\r\nIsidro follows Guts in the hopes of becoming his apprentice. Or, at the very least, doing his best to learn from him. So, naturally, he follows the Black Swordsman wherever he goes.\\n\\n\r\nPuck, the blue and floating spirit, tags along, too. But, rather than learning from Guts, Puck chooses to oversee Guts and his exploits \u2013 while also seeing the truth behind him and the situation. He annoys Guts, but Puck occasionally helps the weathered warrior (albeit in comedic fashion).\\n\\n\r\nSerpico appears rather reserved at first glance. But, once Guts treats Farnese a bit too harshly for his (Serpico\u2019s) own liking, he takes it upon himself to strike at Guts. Another way to put it, Serpico and Guts are rivals, a brains-versus-brawn dichotomy that won\u2019t give either way.\\n\\n\r\nCasca, the addled woman that Guts sacrifices himself for, doesn\u2019t pay him any mind. Despite his feelings and his obvious actions to save her, she looks at him the same way as everybody else (save for Griffith, given her reaction upon his rebirth). She shows the audience that even Guts, despite his special powers and aura, cannot fully influence everyone around him.\\n\\n\r\nBut by far the most interesting is his relationship with Farnese who is very much the best character of the season.\\n\\n\r\nTheir initial meeting starts with swords raised, and, already, Farnese demonstrates she is no match for Guts, beating him only due to fatigue on his part. When she unfairly holds him in her tent, his lambasting of God and her own mindset sends her into a furious rage. She lashes Guts with a whip, and, as atonement later in the night, she lashes herself. Thus, Farnese starts as a seemingly pious woman who shows weakness of both body and mind.\\n\\n\r\nGuts soon kidnaps her to keep himself protected, and an interesting detail surfaces: She cannot see Puck due to her narrowmindedness. The subsequent set of events she goes through \u2013 the rabid dogs, the cannibalistic man-servant, the ghost that possesses her \u2013 begin to warp her worldview. Not enough to change it completely but enough to make her despise Guts for who he is and what he has shown her.\\n\\n\r\nThe two don\u2019t interact for a while. Guts runs to save Casca, and Farnese, alongside Father Mozgus, deals with the \u201cquestioning\u201d of the refugees. During this time, Farnese\u2019s leadership and sanity are questioned in return. She failed to capture the Black Swordsman, and she cannot seem to control or direct the Holy Knights properly. And she acts strangely content as people burn alive before her. Her faith renewed due to Father Mozgus\u2019s own devout prostration before Him.\\n\\n\r\nYet the sights of unjust acts, like a mother forced into torture or a bully wrongly accused, haunt her. Though her mind does it most. A nightmare from her childhood, where adults cheered her on for taking part in the burning of heretics, does not just make her orgasm. It makes her question herself.\\n\\n\r\nGuts\u2019s eventual arrival angers Farnese. Both because of her embarrassment at failing in her mission and at having to potentially run into the man that has challenged what she thinks. In retaliation, and in bit of karmic retribution, she kidnaps Casca, taking her back to the nearby tower. There, she learns that she will be removed from this current mission soon, angering her further. But only until she witnesses the summoning of a malformed monster. For then fright overtakes her once more.\\n\\n\r\nShe inevitably \u201cruns into\u201d Guts \u2013 their first interaction since parting ways at the mansion \u2013 and he forces her to come with him despite her extreme apprehension. There, in the torture room, she finally sees Puck, indicating that her mindset has indeed begun to shift.\\n\\n\r\nDuring Guts battle with Father Mozgus and his \u201cangels,\u201d the situation continues to terrify Farnese, causing her more and more to wonder what\u2019s really right and what\u2019s really, really wrong. She hardly participates, simply watching as Guts shatters everything before her (both literally and figuratively).\\n\\n\r\nThe final fight on the wall, where everyone uses flames to stop the monster\u2019s encroachment, pushes Farnese hard enough to change her completely. Guts\u2019s steadfastness \u2013 despite the doom, the malignancies, and the evil that surrounds them \u2013 awes Farnese. She no longer sees Guts as this cruel, despicable man but rather as a beacon of hope. A shining light amidst the unfathomable darkness. In her own words, \u201cHe still stands and refuses to back down in this overwhelming nightmare. In all of this, he is the only certainty!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nShe ditches praying at Guts command and stands her ground with the others. Afterwards, once Griffith is reborn and Guts gives chase (with Casca in tow), Farnese also abandons the Holy Knights. Choosing instead to follow Guts, the man that challenged her. In a way, given what Guts represents, she\u2019s merely swapping one god for another. But such blasphemy highlights just how much she has changed \u2013 and just how far she is willing to go.\\n\\n\r\nFarnese directly coincides with the anime\u2019s ideas on religion and sin. How the two are different and, indeed, closely linked. Combined with her solid characterization and tangible development, Farnese proves that Berserk, when it wants to, can provide strong, worthwhile material.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nAnother major complaint that most have with this season is its sound-effects. More specifically, Guts\u2019s sword hitting his enemies \u2013 be they blobs, stone, or armor-wearing humans \u2013 overuses a clang upon impact. While it makes sense that it would make this sound, since it is a giant slab of metal, such complaints are valid, for it diminishes the overall execution of the fights when they all start to sound so similar and lack finesse.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track, though, hits the mark. Its heavy-metal composition, through fast drums and wicked guitar playing, give it a (coincidentally enough) heavy and cool feeling. Interspersed throughout the first half of the piece are lighter moments where the guitar is more soothing than frantic \u2013 only for the second half to give way to that overbearing metal sound. The effect becomes a small sense of hope in the beginning yet a constricted sense of despair by the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track goes the complete opposite direction (as is common with OP and ED combos). It\u2019s a much lighter, more mystical-sounding song with female vocals and acoustic guitar. Most importantly, it adopts a bittersweet feel that reapplies that glimmer of hope. That maybe, just maybe, everything will be all right \u2013 or at least better than how it all is now.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the original soundtrack goes for atmosphere and epic-ness. Grating violins and humming create the darker, scarier tone of the show. And the different choir sections, plus more heavy metal, make the action scenes and tenser moments more awesome than they would be otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice-acting performances, none are notable to discuss.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIn the past, when people asked, \u201cWhich character has suffered the most?\u201d Guts would nearly unanimously be the top reply. I never understood why. Not that I doubted the answer, but I didn\u2019t think it was as bad as people made it out to be.\\n\\n\r\nBut I get it now.\\n\\n\r\nHe lost the people he considered family. His arm severed, the other parts of his body scarred permanently. The woman he loves more than anybody else in existence was brutally assaulted to the point of insanity. All at the hands of a single man, the person that Guts once considered his best of friends.\\n\\n\r\nI should note that these words are all conjecture since the anime technically never shows any of it in large detail (although I expect them to do so in due time). Not that I need to see it let alone want to, but it\u2019s not hard to understand that, even with just piecing all the information together, Guts has, indeed, suffered more than any other anime character.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is another one where it pulls me along just for the fact that I need to make sure that a specific character is okay. I.e., Casca. I never like seeing a character in danger for long periods, so, if nothing else, the anime got me watching one episode after another just to make sure Casca was safe.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, I should say, I do want to know what\u2019s coming next. The duality, relationship, and conflict that Guts shares with Griffith is something that intrigues me a lot. Similar thoughts from me on the other characters. But unless the plot picks up in a significant way, the art gets a bit of a boost, and the action is more than just Guts swinging his sword (e.g., more interesting fights like that of Guts and Serpico\u2019s duel on the cliffs), it\u2019ll be a tough go once more \u2013 which may not be worth it.\\n\\n\r\nBerserk (2016) is not without strengths. Its themes on the religious and the sinful are noteworthy, Farnese\u2019s character is well thought out, and the OP is a heavy-metal hitter. But so much else \u2013 the weird writing, less-than-ideal art and animation, not much focus on most of the cast, improper use of sound-effects \u2013 belittle the experience. Hopefully it takes some cough medicine to cure its ailments before that next season arrives.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, while themes on religion and sin provide interesting talking points, much of the narrative is mired in awkward plot decisions, too much focus on sex, and a lack of moral ambiguity\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, nice character designs, more negative than positive artistic direction, and below average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Guts\u2019s backstory is kept mostly secret for now, but his influence on the others is tangible, and Farnese\u2019s character, in arc, in substance, and in purpose, stands as the top highlight\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good OP, okay ED, okay OST, okay VA performances, and bad sound-effects\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, Guts really does suffer more than anybody\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "I will start by saying two things.\r\nFirst, I liked the original 1997 anime for what it was: an advertisement of the manga. It was nothing great but nailed the tone, and that is really most of what I wanted from it.\r\nSecond, I have no issue with an adaptation deviating from the source material so long as it results in a more solid and coherent story. The Lord of the Rings films are a good example of this.\r\nOkay. That said, this anime is a giant pile of shit.\r\nThe animation and visuals are terrible. Everyone knows this, though my major issue with them is the direction, andthe direction is very baffling when it's not outright nauseating. It's blatantly obvious that the director has no clue how to direct in 3D, and even the direction during the 2D scenes feels inappropriate for Berserk. A lot of the sound design and music choices are also very incompetent (CLANG, Jazz, overuse of Hai Yo, etc..). I will, however, admit that there has been a bit of improvement in these areas in the recent episodes of the 2017 season 2. Not a great deal, but it is noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is pure nonsense, though. The 2016 season should not have been an adaptation of the Conviction arc, and it is clear to me that the studio performed a large number of ass-pulls to make the arcs and chapters that they skipped flow into it. Also, this anime seems to be half backstory. Seems like almost all of the events of the Golden Age and the skipped content were recapped throughout, in addition to other things needed to set up the story. Have you seen a movie or show where a character stops the plot for three hours to talk about everything that happened before the movie or show? If so, I hope you really enjoyed it, because \"Berserk: Exposition\" would have made for a more accurate title for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not much better, mostly due to the skipped content removing much of their introduction and motivations, but a lot of it is also the really awful script. The most significant problem is that focus is given to useless characters in this anime such as Nina, Collette's father, and the bandits from epsiode 1. Another thing is that the anime is paced much faster than it should be, so character development, where there is any, comes in huge chunks which you really do not have much of an opportunity to digest before other things start happening. Lastly, because of the pacing, characters tend to recover from really horrifying or really emotional things with incredible speed. There's very little sense that anyone in this anime is actually experiencing the things that happen to them. Why should I care, then?\\n\\n\r\nI went into this anime with an open mind. And my open-minded opinion is that this anime is terrible.\\n\\n\r\n3/10.",

            "content": "This adaptation was filled with horrible artwork and animation all around. The artwork was mostly 3D that made PS2 games look like it was made on the Unreal engine. Most character models look lifeless and are reused a lot, the animation does not flow smoothly at all, and there is zero detail put into anyone, even Guts! There are parts where there is drawn animation, but even that is undetailed crap with the only animation being the characters' mouths moving.\r\nPlus there was no character development. They did nothing to show any of the characters' convictions or development. All they do to show you how Gutsfeels about Casca is having him yell her name a bunch of times. They also do nothing to show the complex thoughts rushing through Guts' mind, such as that he actually hates killing and doesn't revel in the blood of his enemies. He is portrayed as some asshole just killing people left and right to get to Casca.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of stuff was cut out too, such as the Lost Children Arc, the fight between Griffith and Zodd (which tells us why Zodd is siding with him and missing a horn), and they do nothing to explain why the Knights of the Iron Chain are after him. \\n\\n\r\nIt was also riddled with horrible editing, extremely poor sound quality (seriously, why does his sword make a sound resembling pots banging together?!), very mismatched music, and a slew of other problems. \\n\\n\r\nThe creator of this anime adaption was highly unqualified to do this, as he had A) Never worked on an anime with quality or a serious tone, and B) Had zero experience with 3D animation.\\n\\n\r\nEven though Berserk is so artistic and complex that it's near impossible to perfectly adapt it, there was no excuse for this steaming pile of shit. \\n\\n\r\nAnd for anyone defending this anime, let me ask, do you like the Dark Souls games? You do? Okay now imagine if we took Dark Souls and lowered its graphics to minimal settings, replaced the sound effects with pots and pans, got rid of 90% of the narrative, and threw in mixes of techno remixes and metal at odd times. That roughly translates to what Shin Itagaki's inexperienced ass did to the Berserk manga. \\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend this to anyone, especially any Berserk fans. I would recommend, the Berserk manga (which is one of the greatest manga ever), the original anime (Listed as Kenpuu Denki Berserk), and the 3 Golden Age Arc movies. The movies aren't perfect, but they're 100x better than this.",

            "content": "Berserk 2016, from the beginning the horrible art and animation evokes the natural reflex of an anime fan to switch it off immediately. But the strong desire to see an anime adaptation of the great manga and a sequel to the 1997 series made me ignore the horrible visuals up to the bar scene, but when the ping-pong camera angels were added, I switched off disgusted. In short, the first minutes of the show already leave no doubt why so many fans are terribly disappointed.\r\nThe manga written by Miura Kentaro tells the story of the swordsman \"Guts\" and how the serious conflict and his desirefor vendetta arose. The plot is really dark, the medieval fantasy is gritty and hyper-violently as well as gloomy and really bloody. The manga is still successful today, thanks to the brilliant artwork and the well thought-out story that Miura-san created. So I agree with the majority that the most rewarding way to experience the story is to read the manga. But if you prefer to watch the anime instead and ask for advice on how to get started, let me offer you two options:\\n\\n\r\n1. Start with the 1997 series, because the plot is from the \"Gold Age Arc\", which plays before Berserk 2016, so your benefit is that you become familiar with both the characters and their relationships.\\n\r\n2. The other way is to watch the three movies. There are some differences between the 1997 series and the films, but both give enough background information to follow the sequel \"Berserk 2016\" well.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in \"Berserk 2016\" derives from the \"Conviction Arc.\", Guts has been branded and his quest for revenge had already begun. If you start with \"Berserk 2016\" right away, you will surely be confused. For this reason it is recommended to read the manga first or at least to watch the 1997 series or the movies, otherwise you don't know what happened and how it came about. There's a lot of criticism that the story was slaughtered, but I think that's a bit too rough. It's true, however, that most parts of the \"Black Swordsman Arc\" and \"The Lost Children\" were omitted. Although this doesn't affect the story as a whole, it's annoying because on the other hand, some unnecessary scenarios have been added that are bizarre and completely out of place e.g. Farnese / horse. The manga is brilliant, but \"Berserk 2016\" only shows what the \"Conviction Arc\" is all about. The directing made severe mistakes, especially by simply telling the story at a bad pace, adding unnecessary things or stretching them. As a result, the pleasure watching it was ruined. Moreover, storytelling rushed through many important scenarios, just to show as much as possible, even if it completely destroys the few good spots it could have.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the characterizations do not deserve a better judgment. The main characters are changing their personality and behavior due to the torments they have gone through, but these are the missing parts I mentioned earlier. Moreover, other characters were not introduced at all or only marginally, e.g. Dokuro no kishi, this character is known only to people who have read the manga or seen the 1997 series / movies. Another example is Schierke, you can only catch a few glimpses of her. She is simply thrown into the story, regardless of her essential significance for the further action. On the other hand, a lot of time has been spent, or rather wasted, on the comedy of Puck and Isidor. The characters are described similarly in the manga, but can't convince in the anime because of the compression. On the contrary, the comedy destroys the last bit of gloomy atmosphere, which has already suffered a lot from the extremely poor visuals and quality.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals, to use this term for the almost disgusting visual adaptation is a euphemism par excellence! Usually this generic term covers only the aspects,  the artwork and the animation. However, this would be an too limited approach. In this case, also cinematography, colours, contrasts and 2D/3D combinations should be discussed.\\n\r\nCinematography:\\n\r\nDisregard of fundamental principles makes dealing with Berserk 2016 terrible. The bar scene is the best example. It starts like a reminiscence of the 1997 series, in a bar, but the rest is awful. The camera angles change so often that you lose the sense of space. When you find the floor again, the cut will throw you into another scene. It is no pleasure to watch.\\n\r\nColours:\\n\r\nGood Lord! On the one hand, the colour palette is blunt (e.g. Casca) and has no adequate depth to describe the emerging atmosphere as gloomy and dark. On the other hand, there are colours that are so extremely shiny that they could brighten up the darkness.\\n\r\nShadows:\\n\r\nThis so-called 2D/3D hybrid content character and object design with rendering through cell-shading, is simply put, painful for the eyes. In addition, the shadows of the figures and their shades were created with linear hatching that look like pencil strokes. Not that the overall picture could get even worse. In a manga this technique may even be useful. By the way, Minura-san's manga has a very detailed and appealing art. On the other hand, in an anime it looks like it was done in a hurry, it looks cheap and does not do justice to the original in any way.\\n\r\n2D / 3D combination and details:\\n\r\nAs if the above wasn't bad enough already, the rare 2D drawings, though not outstanding, look pretty good compared to the 3D animations. The fact that the animated 3D figures look like lifeless puppets without facial expressions makes identification with the characters almost impossible. Details are only as important as their relevance to the plot. Nevertheless, for a 2016 anime, it's a serious mistake to lack expressive facial expressions that could have made the characters more comprehensible. This could also have compensated for the weakness of the characterization in the adaptation. With such a good source of wonderfully detailed artwork, this is a mistake that can't be forgiven if the visual adaptation is a complete disaster. It is not the case that 3D techniques cannot be used in an appealing way. But as far as Berserk 2016 is concerned, you simply have to realize that they seem unimaginative and unprofessional. A work that says simply and clearly: \"As cheap as possible to make money\". It is indeed a disgrace to the beautiful manga!\\n\\n\r\nThe sound section is the only aspect that looked like an effort to do at least one thing well. For the synchronization of the characters some very experienced voice actors were engaged. Griffith's voice is spoken by Sakurai Takahiro, whose curriculum vitae already includes a variety of narrator roles. The same goes for Farnese's voice, which is spoken by Hikasa Y\u014dko and although Iwanaga Hiroaki as the voice of Guts, doesn't have so much experience, I was surprised how well he fits into the role. On the other hand, some critics have mentioned the good music arrangements, and I disagree. The music didn't convince me at all, because the BGM often seemed strange and misplaced or even misleading throughout the whole series. An example: Guts goes through a so-called gloomy forest, the criticism of the inability to create a suitable atmosphere, we already had above. In this scenario, the only audible sounds are falling raindrops, that was not bad at all. Then the scene continues and Guts was invited to climb into the brightly lit carriage and the creepy music begins. This scene is just an apt example for the poor sound directing and shows that the pictures and the music in general don't harmonize. Only a few moments later, red-glowing eyes of creatures appear in the surrounding trees, evoking a sense of fear in the audience.Why doesn't the creepy music start here?\\n\r\nThe OP used some well-chosen Images in terms of the text and the music. However, this is a deception package, because many of the pictures used were taken from the 1997 series. I found the ED completely unimpressive, so I heard it for the first time and then skipped the whole time. The sound effects, especially the sound of the sword is so ridiculous. Although Guts puts only his fingers around the sword handle, there is this terrible sound. The sound of the sword is artificial, omnipresent, constant no matter what it hits, bodies, stones, skeletons. All in all it is terribly annoying.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not the point that I spent a lot of time watching this uninspired, poorly executed CGI  adaptation that ignores some fundamental rules on how to create an appealing anime. What hurts the most is simply the fact that after this CGI monster there will be no faithful or even successful adaptation of this very good source material. There's usually no such thing as right or wrong, and we won't accuse anyone for creating anything in their own way, but this policy is based on the assumption that the creative team knows, and takes care of the source. Be honest, did you feel like they tried? A shiver runs down one's spine if imagining what kind of anime we're going to be hurt by, if that's the future. Do you want to watch it anyway? Don`t say I did not warn you.\\n\\n\r\nUsually, I close with the phrase \"Have fun watching!\", but to watch it completely was excruciatingly difficult for me and no fun at all.",

A few side characters get introduced and over the 12 episodes they show small changes to their personality and personal objectives but it all hints at a lot more to come.\\n\r\nAs for the story it basically covers one arc of the manga and this is where i feel like the other main critique of the anime lies, it seems to skip a lot of content compared to the manga. But i don't think it is a problem, the arc shown in the anime is pretty complete. All the skipped content wouldn't bother a non manga reader and better yet there is still a lot of new content to discover if someone decides to read the manga after watching this series!",

Now that I have said that take into account that this review is based only on my impression of this and only this season since I have not seen the previous content. Now lets get started I enjoyed this series now I am pretty sure if I go back and watch everything else I  still think I would change much of what I think already. For starter the animation it really popped out at me, now I didn't particularly hatethe animation but I didn't love it either it was alright. The story was good I liked it, it was easy to follow and I picked up on what had happened in the past pretty easily. All in all its a good anime a little rough but good other people are burning it to the ground because of the past anime and movies being way better and I can't argue because many people that are giving bad reviews have been waiting on a continuation for I think about 16 years or so, so I don't blame them but either way give it a try and don't really be swayed by reviews and judge it yourself. Well that was my 2 cents later.",

We've seen so many useless remakes of our favorite comic heros from DC and Marvel, now Japan spits in our face.  Give us what we want.  Let Madhouse do the series JUSTICE!\r\nStory 6:  It's Berserk so it has to get a 6 at least.  They cut out a lot of the important parts, and censoring just made it so bland and PG.\r\nArt 2:  Gods it was so bad.  People saying it looksgood or the pencil makes add depths are in denial.  Clunky animation, worse action scenes that use cuts and shaky cam.  The pencil marks just look like the characters were dragged along an asphalt road and have skid marks.  I've seen better animation in MMD.  We've seen great #d animation from Square, Dreamworks, and  Pixar...  Making the most popular manga of all time like this... is an insult.  Guess Square is the only one that can do great CG in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nSound 2:  Well we all know about the same clang sound over and over.  Music was alright, but doesn't compare the the POWER of Susumu Hirasawa \"Forces\" in the original.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2:  Horrible, abysmal, and second worst next to art. Hardly any facial change to any character.  No epic rage change to Guts as he desperately defends the one he loves.  The facial expression and body language is ruined by the clunky animation.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall 2:  Put these two together.  It was one of the worst experiences in my whole anime watching life.  Each episode (I watched the whole thing) was like being stabbed in my gut, over and over. I usually don't wish bad things on people, but I hope Millipense gets the boot and we get a decent studio.",

Members of the fanbase (such as myself) were eagerly awating the day an adaptation of the Black Swordsman arc and everything that comes after it would come, Berserk being almost 30 years old at this point. Well after having watched Berserk 2016, I wish we'd never gotten one.\r\nSave yourself some time and read the manga as watching the anime justisn't worth it, the 3d cgi is absolutely terrible and while it does follow the Tower of Conviction arc rather well giving the anime an amazing story arc it feels really weird to start the Berserk story at this point for all new comers and even weirder to expect people already fan of the series to put up with those god sound design and visuals. Only good thing that came out of it was the new Murata track and that's about it.",

            "content": "The first time I watched the PV for the new Berserk anime, I immediately knew that it was going be terrible. A Berserk adaptation buy a no name studio by a staff with zero experience with the subject, there was nearly zero percent chance that this adaptation will be any good. However, in my mind, I thought this can be a show I can be worked up about it and kill time during this excruciatingly bland summer season. So I sat down expecting a terrible show to get angry at. However, it was so bad, so utterly garbage that I couldn't get worked about it.I feel more pity and misery towards the show rather than that of anger and rage. And I can only imagine how hardcore Berserk fans feel about this completely irredeemable show.\\n\\n\r\nTo get the obvious out of the way, the anime in animated in CG and it looks terrible. Unless you are Marty McFly traveling through time or a person who think Reboots is the pinnacle of CG animation, that CG is obviously sub par. All the character models looks awkward and unnatural. They all look like those human models in early 2000s games where video game developers haven't seen to get the gist of how a human model should look like. The fame rate for this show is so low. It looks like it's running at 15 frames per second as if this is some cheap TV stop motion movie. And what with the weird line shading over everything? I guess it is there to make it look more like the manga. But it just makes the show fall even deeper into the uncanny valley. \\n\\n\r\nMany anime fans think that a fully CG anime is an inherently bad idea. However, that is not true. I know that Japan can make a fully CG anime look good (checkout Appleseed or Avent Children). However, the problem I see with these new 3D anime like Sidonia and Berserk 2016 is they are using CG as a cheaper alternative to 2D animation. CG can look good, but it requires a lot of money and time. This show and all the CG anime in the same vein have none of these traits and that's why these shows looks terrible in comparison to 2D anime. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, the directing doesn't help hid the crummy animation. There are many panning and rotation shots that doesn't fit the anime. Many basic film making techniques like color theory are completely ignored.  A lot of shots are complete overkill and unnecessary making many scenes nearly incomprehensible. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also terrible. Remember the bizarre yet engaging  Susumu soundtrack of the 1997 anime, with amazing tracks like \"Forces\"? This show have none of that. None of the tracks are memorable or fitting. There are many metal tracks that do not fit the tone or atmosphere of Berserk. And did a 5 year old craft the sound effects? The sound design is piss poor. The most obvious example is the sound effect for the Dragon-slayer. The Dragon-slayer tearing through soldiers and Apostates should be bad ass. However, the sound effect they gave it sounds like someone hit a stop sign with a shovel. It sounds dumb and out of place.\\n\\n\r\nThe most offensive aspect of this anime is how it handles the story and characters of Berserk. While the animation and sound makes me want to bash my head in the wall, but I could forgive Berserk 2016 if it was a faithful adaption. But no such luck, and the story and characters are completely neutered.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I have mixed feeling about the Black Swordsman and Conviction arc of Berserk, they do have there good points. However, the anime fail to capture any of these highlights. The Black Swordsman arc is completely glossed over to quickly in the first episode to get to the Conviction arc. And even that is complete rush though at a break neck speed since there are only 11 episode to depict it. Because of the rushed pacing, all the characters feel like caricatures of there manga counter parts. Important details and backdrops to characters are completely dropped, making many of the characters feel empty.\\n\\n\r\nAlso this anime cut out many parts from the manga. I can understand to a degree why studios cut out parts from the source material such as time constants. For example, the original 1997 series cut out the skull knight even though he is important in the manga. Even though I was disappointed they cut him out, I can understand why decided to cut him out. That series was completely focused on the Golden Age arc and he was not need in that arc. \\n\\n\r\nBut in contrast, the arcs and story beats that the 2016 series takes out are necessary for the arc they are adapting. The Rosina arc and the Post Eclipse arc are completely excluded from this series even though they are important to understand post Eclipse Guts. And characters and parts from later volumes are included in this series for no reason. For example, Isidro appears in the bar scenes in the first episode though he shouldn't appear until several volumes later. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, Berserk 2016 is a tragedy. There is nothing redeemable about this show. The animation is terrible, the sound is terrible, the writing is terrible, everything is simply terrible! It feels like I am looking into an infinity of terrible. I couldn't even push myself to finish watching this show, and considering that I sat through Akame ga Kill and GATE, that is saying something. I only got to episode 6 so I don't know how they handle the remaining part of the Conviction arc. And honestly, I don't really care. There is nothing that the series can do to redeem itself to me. So whether you are a Berserk fan or not, the only advice I can give you is to avoid this show at all cost. If you want get into Berserk, either watch the 1997 series or read the manga.",

            "content": "(This review may contain spoiler and name drops of other anime and other forms of media)\r\nMove over KonoSuba's explosions and Re:Zero's \"I Love Emilia\" because Berserk 2016 is the true biggest anime meme of its year! And here is why.\r\nStory - 3/10:\r\nWhile the 1997 original wasn't exactly fantastic, it still did a great job of exploring morals of humanity in dark and deconstructive ways. This on the other hand, forces unnecessary comic relief such as Puck and Isidro, that only made me laugh and cringe at the exact same time to the point where both of them became memes. I guess the story makes youlaugh hard but this is definitely not what Berserk is supposed to do, right?\\n\\n\r\nArt - 2/10:\\n\r\nEveryone hates the art style because it is made with CGI. But here is the thing, CGI anime does not make it bad, which Ajin already proved saying that CGI animation can work if done right. However, the CGI in Berserk 2016 is a huge far cry from Ajin's CGI accomplishment as it looks downright hilariously horrible. To make matters worse, there are instance of mixing CGI and 2D animation that makes things even worse, which in turn was proven when Puck flies at supersonic speeds. That scene is so hideous (as in ugly animation) that it also has become a gif meme! Yikes.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 1/10:\\n\r\nThe intro sounded fantastic... until you realize that it was the full version, making the OP bad. The outro ED is merely forgettable. But the main aspect of the sound that utterly destroyed the score is the sound known as \"CLANG!\" which ended up becoming one of the most popular anime memes of 2016 due to how hilariously bad it was. And this was the ONLY case where anime's sound aspect got an awfully low score not for the soundtrack or OP's or ED's but for the sound effects! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4/10:\\n\r\nWhile it was rather nice to see the return of Guts the Black Swordsman after almost 2 decades of anticipation, his return was rather anticlimactic as this anime looked just so bad. I already mentioned the awful comic relief characters known as Puck the fairy and Isidro. However, the biggest offender is Casca, and unlike most other characters that I hate from other anime, I used to like Casca for her strong independence as a warrior. The sad thing is that Casca is now just incapable of doing literally anything, which is truly a shame and probably one of the few bad things about the manga itself. Had this not happened and, Casca wouldn't have been the awful damsel in distress she is now. It really hurts to hate a character that I actually liked in the past and it also hurts that it had to happen this way because it's not even Casca's fault that it happened to her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5/10:\\n\r\nI had decently enjoyed Berserk 2016, because in most cases, I was outright laughing at how bad it is. However, at the same time, I feel rather disappointed that this had to happen to a once great anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3/10:\\n\r\nI guess Berserk 2016 is a good comedy, which it shouldn't be. And overall, this seems to be the beginning of an end for Berserk anime adaptations.\\n\\n\\n",

Forget the poor CGI; bad framing, bad pacing, bad tracking shots, bad angles etc. Berserk 2016 is just plain bad in all areas of film. Or anime or whatever.\r\nI am going to keep this short because this show isn't worth my time, aswell as yours. Simply put - Berserk 2016 has almost all the flaws from a bad director and bad creative vision will bring about. It's a damn shame because the source material is the complete opposite.

            "content": "This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: Picking up around 2 years after the events of the original 1997 series, Berserk (2016) follows the story of Guts on his quest for vengeance after being betrayed and branded as a sacrifice. Haunted by spirits everywhere he goes and driven nearly mad by his rage and pain, he seeks out the demonic Apostles of the God Hand in order to find the man who took everything from him. In his travels he encounters an elf named Puck who accompanies him despite his protests. Guts\u2019 journey of revenge is interrupted when he learns that the onlyperson left that he cares about may be in danger.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]: \\n\\n\r\nAs a story, Berserk is absolutely loaded with a prodigious number of themes and parallels about dreams, evil, free will, and fate. While the world and grim dark setting of the story is integral in its appeal and presentation, many would argue that its most important aspect is its cast of exceedingly complicated, human characters. Their personalities and experiences are the vehicles for all of the incredible, thematic details the narrative has to offer and the impeccable writing surrounding them is one of the major elements that makes Berserk so endlessly engaging.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Berserk (2016) missteps in this regard is in how simplistically it portrays its characters. The cast of the show falls into the very same trap as its story which lacks sufficient context for the adventure being told to be truly compelling. Guts himself should appear quite familiar. Clad in a black suit of armor and wielding his iconic Dragonslayer, his characterization touches upon how the eclipse has changed him and how he\u2019s far more bitter and contemptuous than he once was. But that\u2019s about as far as it goes. What\u2019s lacking is a sense of emotion \u2013 all the madness, hurt, and misery that made Guts so compelling, callous, and different from the man you once knew are reduced to their most basic traits. You get a sense that Guts has changed for the worse but the scope of it all is greatly diminished and what the viewer is left with is a man who allegedly hunts down Apostles with a giant sword and a fatigued wit.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the issue with the cast as a whole. We are introduced to a handful of moderately interesting characters with their own unique personalities and motivations however the intricacy and subtext that made them all so impossibly intriguing and complex has been neglected. You can clearly sense that Farnese possesses a set of questionable morals and undergoes a crisis of faith and you can discern Serpico\u2019s cunning but both are presented very straightforwardly and those attributes are all the characters are made out to be. What\u2019s more, the scenes that speak directly to the more complicated traits of the characters then seem awkward because you can\u2019t tell what purpose there is behind them. What remains are the character\u2019s most rudimentary attributes which leave them feeling stiff and even bland in many instances.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: \\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s production, art, and animation are by far the most discussed and criticized elements of Berserk (2016) and for good reason. The heavy reliance on CG is the most relevant and obvious of the qualms surrounding the show\u2019s visuals however I don\u2019t think that it is in itself the most problematic part of the show\u2019s presentation. The quality of the character models starts off at a horrific low in the first episode and gradually over the course of the entire show improves by an moderate amount. At least by the latter half of the show the characters generally look like themselves with less frequent exceptions. The real damage done by the CG is not just in how off-model a lot of the characters look but in how their rigid and choppy animation cycles and movement drain would-be dramatic scenes of their intensity and seriousness. The juxtaposition of the CG characters against other two-dimensional supporting cast members that share the screen with them further accentuates their outlandish appearance.\\n\\n\r\nThe most pervasive visual problem with Berserk (2016) is in its directing and camera movement. The cinematography shifts between being relatively smooth and even reasonably inventive at times to being uninspired and obnoxious at the drop of a hat. The \u2018camera\u2019 has to do extra work and be over-active to compensate for the low quality of a lot of the scenes but what results is a presentation that feels overly busy and needlessly restless. The camera jolts and darts around to create a sense of action and combat however there is very little cohesion between the different shots so the whole composition falls apart. The directing shows signs of improvement near the tail-end of the show but fails to become anything entirely redemptive. There are some decent key-frames thrown into the mix and occasionally the rather lengthy action shots develop in an interesting way however for the greater part, the whole look of the show is unfortunately pretty disastrous.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]: \\n\\n\r\nGiven the other rather immense shortcomings of Berserk (2016) it comes as some surprise that the show follows its source material fairly closely once it gets rolling. Even within the show the first episode stands out as both visually and narratively different. While the second episode and onward tell a reasonably coherent story, the first episode tries to compensate for an immense amount of content missing from the adaptation \u2013 attempting to catch the viewer up with who Guts has become since last seeing him in the eclipse. The show throws together a few characters and concepts to do so but its poor visual design and subject matter predictably aren\u2019t able to fully capture Guts\u2019 missing characterization. This lack of context is what most damages the story.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of Berserk\u2019s appeal is grounded in its ability to snowball intricate backstories, character development, and themes into a grand interweaving narrative and the show completely fails to follow through on this. The show neglects prefacing a lot of its scenes and characters, not just in regards to Guts\u2019 shift in personality over the years. The show follows the story rather closely but it gives no weight to what happens. There is no significance or united meaning behind each scene as it transpires and what results are moments with very little build up and little to no payoff. Everything just happens without hardly any justification. Not only does it undermine one of the key elements of what makes Berserk good but its a lackluster example of storytelling in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nBerserk (2016) does arrive at moments of importance and is able to execute them with some degree of emphasis and the storytelling like the show\u2019s visuals and sound design improve towards the end of the show. Though the story lacks the implications it originally had, the plot as it unfolds still has interesting developments and characters. This is all to say that, the show is not without its standalone moments but they aren\u2019t impressive enough to fully outweigh the negative elements it possesses elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]:\\n\\n\r\nSomewhat unexpectedly, it\u2019s the show\u2019s music and sound mixing which is its second biggest shortcoming after its shoddy directing. The sound that Guts\u2019 Dragonslayer makes when it swings through something was comical to the point of becoming a joke. Whether he was hacking through wood, armor, stone, or bones, his sword would emit the same absurd \u2018clang\u2019 which felt progressively more and more out of place until it was changed sometime in the show\u2019s latter half. Though the sword example is the most obvious one, this issue of mismatched audio and even poorly timed effects was highly pervasive in the show and led to a lot of scenes feeling very awkward and poorly put together. Things would frequently make inappropriate sounds out of time with the visual presentation. In short, the show couldn\u2019t sell a punch. The audio undermined believably and made the action scenes feel uncomfortable on most occasions instead of impressive or exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is the other half of this issue. The soundtrack itself is actually quite good. It fits the tone of the show well enough and features an impressive, memorable track from Susumu Hirasawa. The problem that arises is in how the soundtrack is executed within the scene. These otherwise impressive tracks chime in at the weirdest times, starting and stopping at a moments notice and in complete disregard to what is happening on screen. It\u2019s a case of wasted potential. Each track presses up against the next unceremoniously and the manner in which they come to an abrupt halt before the next starts in is downright disconcerting.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve done my best not to review this show as a fan of Berserk but as a fan of anime. Berserk (2016) didn\u2019t just fail at being a Berserk adaptation, it failed on its own merits as a show. The story being told wasn\u2019t uncompelling and the show captures fleeting instances of Berserk\u2019s narrative charm however its lack of context and the shoddiness of its audiovisual design greatly hampers what could have been a decent anime.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 4\\n\\n\r\nI gave Berserk (2016) a 4 primarily because of its incredibly awkward production. While the CG and audio mixing improved slightly towards the end of the series, it was still of pretty poor quality all throughout. The groundwork that is Berserk and the show\u2019s faithfulness in adapting the actual narrative and bits of dialogue is what spares the show from a lower score and for all of its issues its still reasonably entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]: \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to recommend this show for any reason but if there was one it would be for people that can look past an unattractive visual presentation and still enjoy the story being told. If poor CG or bad visuals are typically a turn off for you then I would stay away from this show but if you are intensely curious as to where Berserk\u2019s story goes after the golden age and don\u2019t mind how the show looks or sounds, then you may very well enjoy it. In all seriousness, read the manga \u2013 that\u2019s the best recommendation I can give.",

            "content": "WARNING: This is a review of THE ACTUAL ANIME, not my BULLSH** preconcieved version of what it *should* be. I've judged Mr.2016 on what Mr.2016 offers. Nothing else. \r\nSkip the next 3 paragraths (Between the arrows) for actual review. \r\n-------------------------------------->\r\nI realize manga readers have expectations. It's the best manga ever drawn, every stroke of his pencil exudes talent, purpose & love. It DESERVES to have an anime that lives up to it's brilliance. I can understand peoples disappointment when what they got is a seemingly rushed money-grab with cheap 3D animation. Hell, if fans weren't happy with Studio 4C's version then they're just guaranteed tobe miserable with any adaptation barring a $100m masterpiece manga-clone with no music, perfect pacing, perfect animation & perfectly portrayed characters.\\n\r\n \"They're making a mokery of Berserk. This isn't berserk! \"Berserk is supposed to be dark and gritty, look at the bug eyes, his movements are stiff they use cheap sound effects. This is awful. They clearly dont understand what makes berserk good\" an understandable 'guts' reaction... ;D Or is it?\\n\r\nI went into the show simply wanting to see what happens next to Guts an Casca..\\n\r\n Something we can all agree on? What a wonderful story berserk is. Mr.2016 might not be telling the story the way you expected nor wanted, but to let a preconcieved idea hurt your ability to enjoy a show? I'll judge the show based on it's own merits. \\n\r\n------------------------------------>>>>>>\\n\r\nDoes the anime show enough of the masterpiece story to justify itself amongst other anime? Is it actually the flop people claim? \\n\r\nShould someone brand new to anime watch BERSERK? \\n\r\n;Or would they be better off never experiencing it simply because \"it didnt adapt the manga the way I wanted\"??  WE WILL FIND OUT NOW, because my opinion is always correct. YW \\n\\n\r\n------------------> ART<----------------- 7 :)\\n\r\nKept getting reminded of attack on titan while watching. Similar shading and artstyles. You could screenshot almost any point an the still-frames would look very similar to what an AOT still-frame would look like. I would argue the biggest factor in Berserk coming across as \"ugly\" is because it's not what people expected. Sure, the animation might be a bit stiff at times and the CG stands out a lot more than in AOT.. But the overall look is very similar.\\n\\n\r\nBackgrounds look great, breathy views, a lot of details go into the set designs. \\n\r\nAt times there are some amazing animation sequences, a lot of the \"epic\" moments from the manga have had extra effort an money invested into them and they look amazing. At times looks like it's pulled straight from the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe style is definitely unique, the CG isn't for everyone, however the style grew on me very quickly and I begun to really enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\n--------------->>>>CHARACTERS<<<<------ 7\\n\\n\r\nI was actually a bit disappointed by the characters here. By far my favorite part of the original (and what got me so hooked on the series) was the characters. Guts, Casca & Griffiths character growth, and love-triangle (lol) was incredibly deep and meaningful, it gave a real intensity to the characters. That dynamic is defo missing in this arc...\\n\\n\r\n. No one really develops at all through 2016s adaption (except the temporary characters). However, that's understandable as it takes place over a far shorter period of time (Kind of) but having those intense relationships missing from the plot hurt the story and characters imo.\\n\\n\r\n--------------->ENJOYMENT<<<<<----------- 8\\n\\n\r\nhonestly.. so much fun. I binged the entire thing in 1 night. I used to regularly binge shows overnight but it has become less an less frequent with less good anime available to watch. This however wasn't even a challenge.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode ended on a cliffhanger, I was always on the edge of my seat. Always wanting something to happen. Whether it was hoping Casca was okay, if Guts was gonna kill someone, if the dumb blonde woman would hurry up an die. I don't usually enjoy action anime that much, i get more excited for the characters but this defo kept me excited.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of uhh... light hearted comedic moments too. I was told they were taken straight from the manga so it was obviously as intended.. I think some people would prefer the show be darker w/o those moments but they kept the show pacing at a good level. If anything it was too fast.. I would have much rather had 2-3 extra episodes for character development. \\n\\n\r\n------------------> MY MAIN CRITICISM??<-----------------\\n\\n\r\nMy main issue with mr.2016 is that they like to tell & not show. The 97' version was happy to have long, drawn out pauses with nothing but Guts face. It let us get drawn in, feel for him, empathize with the characters, put ourselves in their shoes. It never really tried too hard to explain things. The characters felt that way, you either picked up on it or you didn't & that is 100% fine. \\n\\n\r\nmr.2016 did do that, but not nearly as much. Guts always had a monologue in his head which I didn't like, there was never any need for it. I would rather just have the scene be silence and tension. It doesn't sound like a big complaint but to me... One of the big draw cards for berserk in the first place was that it never felt preachy, never felt like it was trying to convince you of anything. Guts was a bad ass, they didn't need to constantly point it out.\\n\\n\r\n---------------->OVERALL<--------------------- 7\\n\\n\r\nI'm happy to give this a 7. My average score is like a 6. Out of the 500 anime I've seen (most of which in the top 1000 on MAL) I'd place this easily in the top 100-150. That would make this anime SUPER underrated.\\n\\n\r\nLike really MAL peeps? 5000? I understand having a bad \"gut\" reaction to the art-style but do you people honestly think that an adaption of BERSERK the greatest manga ever written could be worse than all this other trash? Do you think so little of Berserk that you think the artstyle and missing parts of the manga could ruin it so much that it's worse than Fuuka? \\n\\n\r\nSo yes, it's underrated. I recommend 100%. Watch the original first, though.",

After a while that animation style grows on you and you become more used to it.

But don\u2019t just throw yourself into it because it\u2019s a DARK fantasy so it has quite a few disturbing themes like with 3x3 Eyes and Bas*ard, but if your into it then you\u2019ll love Berserk. The Conviction arc is quite a good arc overall, the anime did skip a few things like events prior to that arc but I guess they did it due to it being hard to start an anime on and because its not one of the most interesting side-arcs. I\u2019m glad with how they\u2019ve done this anime, they didn\u2019t skimp out on the violence and blood.

The Story is still good, that is why Berserk ranked #1 in manga.\r\nMany people rated this low, I think because of it's animation. To be honest I found it weird too, they could have just make it normal anime, but I think the production want it to make different. I believe this animation is somewhat like the future animation, but they failed it. If you watch the entire anime, they are making each character to be 3D (which is not necessary), the execution are awful... and whatto I mean by awful?....Watch the anime until the ending and the so called \" Next episode preview\" is just weird, it's like a non-pro in anime can do it.\\n\\n\r\nI wish they would change Berserk 2017 into normal anime, stop the 3D animation, it's making a lag when Im watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is not that special, unlike when you hearing the sound tracks of Berserk 1997 series..that make you nostalgic and feel the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime is good Rating:7/10\\n\r\nI would suggest to stop this 3D animation, also why would'nt they show some nude parts? Show the tits! It is an art and not to be ashamed of.\\n",

            "content": "Berserk 2016 review part 1\r\nHello, you favorite ANIME reviewer that you've probably heard of here. Today I'll be reviewing Berserk 2016, the masterpiece with plot so unique and unpredictable it will keep you on the edge of your seats for 12 episodes straight. The amazing and complex characters will take your breath away as you fall in love with each and every one of them. Absolute 10/10.\r\nThe story is about a guy named Guts (Gats-kun) who is probably the best character for the average viewer to insert himself into I've seen so far in anime. The guy has absolutely no special features or whatsoever. Normalbuild, MC haircut, generic voice, even his clothes look boring, honestly. Like if this was an actual RPG this would've been the default level 1 male character. It is almost like Kentarou Miura is trying to tell their audience full of 30-year-old virgins \"If this guy can do it, everyone can! Don't lose hope guys!\".\\n\\n\r\n\"Oh come on, no one watches Berserk for the guy anyway. Gimme girls, gimme rape.\"\\n\\n\r\nWell, there is no actual rape (which is probably the only redeeming feature). The girls... Oh... Did I say girl\"S\"? Well, there was just one girl with three different heads because the budget for this one was probably so low they couldn't even afford changing their height or breast size a little. And how there is no rape you ask? Well, it's quite simple. All of the girls are in love with our amazing protagonist even though they are sisters and aware of the fact that he sleeps with all three of them.\\n\\n\r\n\"Characters, plot... you are talking too much, this is Berserk remember? No one really cares about that stuff, I just want to fap, that's all.\".\\n\\n\r\nYes, but it will be kinda hard for you to do so, because on top of all Griffith probably has the most boring sex scenes I've seen in a while. And it's not because the censorship or the awful animation and voice acting. The creativity in this one was close to 0, just 12 episodes of complete emptiness. It's hard to distinguish one sex scene from the others. Even the most hardcore vanilla fan will probably fall asleep unless he starts thinking about his ex or smh.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1,\\n\r\nArt: 4,\\n\r\nSound: 3,\\n\r\nCharacter: 0,\\n\r\nEnjoyment: not found\\n\r\nOverall: 3D>2D \\n\r\nGriffith is an asshole.",

As a fan of Berserk that reed, watched and played in everything, there was - This Is my most favourite thing that exists basically - I accidentally supported this... \"thing\".\r\nIn the beginning, I wanted to say what is my point of view so I'll start with the story after introduction. And the story in Berserk 2016 sucks, too many things were scrapped but not replaced with anything, where is Blackswordsman arc or at least Lost Children? I dunno... Without those, a motivation of Guts looks lacklustre at best. And it's only motivation of one but main character...\r\nArt? there is no art, CGI lookshorrible and not only because it is CGI but - I don't know why - there are many examples of juicy implementation of this technic (JoJo's openings are the simplest that comes to my mind). Also, somehow camera movement is some kind of joke, it gets fussy, unpredictable as it makes the whole show unwatchable.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is like an opening of '97 Berserk - just bizarre and out of place.\\n\\n\r\nSo when it comes to characters I already mentioned a problem with Guts motivation in this abomination but all of them are really lacking something and (sigh) CASCA... CASCA IS FUCKING WHITE, WHY? FUCKING WHY?\\n\\n\r\nThis abomination exists I dunno how, why but it exists and is trying to destroy Berserk name, I can only imagine how this shit which is imitating some story with moral (it's not because it removes so much from original) and using Heavy Metal music to be sooo cool that it throws away most people and so they thing that Berserk (manga) is like that...

            "content": "Berserk 2016 is a CGI anime that tries to imitate the feel of anime. Because of this watching Berserk feels like you are watching gameplay footage of a game that has a very low framerate. The sound, though more interesting than the older adaptation is off sync very often. At a few moments the animation and sounds are so off that they create a jarring experience.\r\nThe anime also seems as if it really doesn't understand Berserk. While Berserk is a violent and horrifying at times, it is also about a man who has survived through great loss. Some of the best moments of Berserk aremoments of quiet contemplation. Reading the characters think or talk about the struggles they had lived through is wonderful and gives them layered personality. Only one episode had this trait and it was also my personal favorite episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also leaves through some of the more interesting/ morally questionable parts of the story and at one point creates a huge plot hole. This may be blamed on the lack of time but this is still a huge flaw.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing about the adaptation I can give proper credit towards is the OP, ED and the music. The opening perfectly captures Guts's struggles and is a damn fine OP. HAI YO is an amazing work of music that instantly pumps you up for a battle.\\n\\n\r\nAll this being said Berserk 2016 was something that made me sad. The only positive is the music and the fact that people who cannot enjoy manga can watch the show, even if it is inferior.\\n",

I didn't like this at all. I give this a 3/10. There can be much improvement to the pacing and character development, the animation/art style could be forgiven if those 2 were improved.\r\nStory 2/10\r\nThe story is interesting and I want to give it a chance, but the way it\u2019s done here is bad. This is rushed. I'm not one to really care about pacing toomuch, but WOW its bad. It\u2019s like I\u2019m watching this on x1.5 speed while skipping non-major plot points. There is always something happening and when it\u2019s done, it\u2019s just a cut to the next thing. There\u2019s so much happening in such a short time. It also seems like there's a lot of character development missing. At the start of Berserk, the elf (or fairy) boy just stuck onto guts (the main character) as soon as he saw him and thought that guts was the greatest. There was no incentive to stick with guts or any build up to it.\\n\\n\r\nBerserk (1997) does a much better job with the story. It is also the prequel to Berserk (2016). I would highly recommend watching Berserk (1997) first. Watching Berserk (1997) was the only reason I finished Berserk (2016) because the story suddenly made sense and I then knew the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt 3/10\\n\r\nThe animation is bad, its poorly done 3d with 2d thrown in. I believe that this could of been pulled off but the way they have it in Berserk (2016), it\u2019s stiff, like amateur 3d animation (this looks like it could of been animated with Alice if given enough time, that\u2019s how stiff it looks). It does get a little bit better past ep 7 and could be excused entirely if the plot wasn\u2019t so poorly done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\r\nI'm going to be honest, I didn't pay much attention to the sound design, and nothing really stuck out or bothered me. The OP was good, I liked it, and I don't remember the ED at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2/10\\n\r\nIf I had only watched Berserk (2016), I wouldn\u2019t of knew the characters and wouldn\u2019t of cared at all about them. Berserk (2016) does a bad job with the story in general and the characters suffer because of it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\r\nI really wanted to like this but I just couldn't for the reasons above. however after watching Berserk (1997) and finishing it halfway though Berserk (2016). Berserk (2016) became watchable. Berserk (2016) also picks up a little after ep 7.\\n\\n\r\n*side note: this was my first review, I apologize if things weren't coherent enough, I tried ^.^\\n\r\nAlso if anyone was wondering what Alice is referring to, it\u2019s a tool used to learn JavaScript using mostly 3d animation, just look up \"Alice 2 Project\" and you will instantly see why I compared the 2.",

Every movement is stiff and unnatural and never improves at all throughout all twelve episodes. They attempt to make characters fit the dark tone by placing shading over their faces which only makes it look even worse. The shading seems to move along with the characters' faces rather than being a part of their face and it's jarring as hell. The horrible direction doesn't help, as fight scenes are frantic and hard to follow, which doesn't fit the tone in the slightest. The sound direction isn't much better, without of place sound effects such as a sword slicing through skeletons sounds like it's giving off sound waves as it is overemphasized and wouldn't make that sound against some bones. Berserk (2016) skips over several important arcs in the story to fit into twelve episodes, which making something as long as Berserk twelve episodes was a stupid decision to begin with. One thing I didn't like about Berserk in general is that it tries too hard to shock the audience and feels forced with constant rape and literal insanity. The very thing that draws people in is also the very thing that pushes people away. Berserk will be hard to watch or read because of its dark nature, and not a lot of people can take watching something like that. Top that off with an adaptation even more hard to watch for all the wrong reasons.",

            "content": "The English  Romantic Poet, Lord Byron, the 6th Baron of Byron, described the Byronic hero simply put, as a man who knew himself a villain, rarely smiled, seldom sighed. Lone, wild and strange. Rarely had affection or contempt. These traits and characteristics, seem to fit a certain mold of a man, a man with proverbial guts, our most loved protagonist, who in my humble opinion, is the most tragic character in history. Berserk is his story, also his history. This is my .02, my reflection of this utmost masterpiece, a truly faithful adaptation of the manga.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nIt was October 8th, 1997 when the originalBerserk Anime was released, Kentaro Miura's most faithful adaptation was being released to the public, and we were all waiting for bated breath, lo and behold we were stunned, it was an absolute masterpiece, it is the original seinen, dark anime, it blew all the other competition into the ocean. This adaptation is a continuation of the legacy Kentaro Miura has left us behind. It is visceral, straight to the action, gore, nudity with no nipples, blood, and violence. Unadulterated violence. It is gratuitous and perfect. I won't post any spoilers, but if you watch this show, you will not regret it, nevermind the animation, it will grow on you. You will fall in love with the struggle of Guts, and his romance with Casca, love conquers all, even demons.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main gripe of the art in Berserk (2016) is the 3d and 2d blend, the polygons and geometry side, plus with the shading does not convey the emotions and surroundings, and it also affects depth perception of the anime. There are also other cinematic problems with blending in 3 dimensional images and 2 dimensional images, studios either go the full 3d route or the 2d route, never in between. Japan has always had a problem with 3d rendering, whereas America has been great at it. I.E. Pixar, Toy story, and such. Do not let the art sway you, the content is all that matters, our struggle with #teamguts is all that matters. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 15/10\\n\\n\r\nSusumu Hirasawa is the Mozart of Japan, in my humble opinion, I fell in love with his soundtrack of the Original berserk, and was thrilled when it was announced that he would be continuing his legacy with the new arcs. His music has been slapping inside my vehicle in the Bay Area since the new arc was released. Hai Yo (Oh Ashes) has been my favorite song ever since. -When you watch this series, you will recognize the masterful soundtrack and the perfect placement of every chord in every scene. It is godlike to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nKentaro Miura created a world that has been copied by many studios and video game developers who created games such as Demon Souls and Dark souls. If I were in a room with Hitler, Stalin and Griffith. And I had 2 rounds of 9mm Parabellum  left in my Glock 17 Gen 4. I'd unload both rounds on Griffith and give Hitler & Stalin a free pass. This is how good, Kentaro Miura created a despicable villain. His writing, and creativity is on the level of JRR Tolkien in my humble opinion. You will love all of the characters of the world of Berserk, they are all multifaceted and cleverly written.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nBerserk a serendipitous gem, poorly understood. Not many people will like this anime. A lot of the die hard fans, have given it horrible reviews. With good reason, but the optimist in me, never sees the negatives. I always have a positive outlook on life, and in the world of Berserk that is all you have. What drives a man like Guts? What separates him from the demon he slays? The philosophical side of Berserk is also deeply misunderstood and it is a great anime to ponder over the years, I have clocked in many hours of reading the manga and I have never gotten bored of it. it is in my opinion the greatest seinen anime/manga ever written.\\n\\n\r\nSee ya later, Space cowboy. \\n\\n",

            "content": "If you ask a casual manga fan whether they want their favourite manga to be adapted into a show. Whether they want the breathtaking action panels to fly off of television screens. Whether they desire for colours to be added to their favourite characters\u2019 faces. Whether they thirst for a weekly reboot of their adolescent nostalgia. The answer is always a resounding yes.\r\nHowever, Berserk (2016) brings many questions\u2014I should say, disappointments\u2014to the Berserk fandom. It hastily brushes aside many things that made the original Berserk (1997) anime such a daring and unforgettable classic. It dulls down Guts, a multifaceted and genuine character, to a meremuscle man whose brawn is shown but whose brain is often hidden. To me, and to many others, the original Berserk (1997) will always hold a special place in our hearts due to its character development, cutting-edge and memorable production, and a controversial but unforgettable (a bit scarring) finality. In contrast, Berserk (2016) makes many mediocre attempts at balancing dark drama and brainless action, yielding it an empty work which incites inspiring themes but fails to consummate what it brings about.\\n\\n\r\nAn action drama, after all, really needs one thing to make it stand out from the crowd: great production, something Berserk (2016) fails to include. From episode one, a fuzzy, dream-like color scheme is applied to a lot of flash-back scenes. Frankly put, it is difficult to distinguish the directors\u2019 deliberate effort from purely elementary school quality crayon drawings. Moreover, some figures\u2014be it a human, animal, or monster\u2014simply look grotesque, and not because they were meant to be ugly, but because the production turned out that way. For instance, when Guts is first seen walking through a tavern in episode one, his cape fazes in and out of his body as if Guts lacks a torso, some limbs, or a backbone. It\u2019s 2016, this should not be happening! And the CGI is hardly an excuse for the low-quality and low-budget production. \\n\\n\r\nTo say the least, exposition of the story is also negatively affected by the subpar production. Unexplained time skips separate from the manga are introduced. Some parts of the Band of Falcons\u2019 stories after the Gold Age, bearing significance to the plot, are cut out or edited randomly. As the plot was difficult for me, having re-read some of the manga recently, to follow, it is more than likely a strenuous task for someone without renewed knowledge of the franchise to follow. Not only do these inconveniences make viewing the show more confusing, they render the existence of this show to be arbitrary as its anime and manga predecessors do everything, from action to development, better and cleaner.\\n\\n\r\nTo elaborate, what made Berserk (1997)\u2019s exposition so memorable was its ability to at times select and adapt the most ethereal, ordinary, or simple panels, focusing instead on the psychological trials and tribulations each character endures. The brilliance of Berserk (1997) originated, then, from vicariously experiencing Guts\u2019 and even Griffith\u2019s torture and desiring redemption for them. It sprung from sharing a common vision of triumphing over a medieval dystopia by way of any means possible. It felt real. Man, did it feel refreshing to watch a show that really tried and was rewarded handsomely. In a nutshell, this laudable attribute is the essential touch Berserk (2016) lacks, thus leading to its tragic downfall.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that makes the grimacing world Berserk (2016) presents all the emptier and unsubstantiated. Most, if not all, the side characters are weak and Guts is grumpy all the time. Why? People are suffering and the world is cruel. So? I understand Berserk (2016) is a sequel and draws upon the viewers\u2019 prior understanding of the Berserk world. However, the discontinuities in Guts\u2019 character from the Golden Age Arc to the Conviction Arc is blatant and unexplored, all due to the directorial decision to cut out some initial parts of the Conviction Arc completely. Likely, again, due to low budget. \\n\\n\r\nWhile one can be justified in saying that the Conviction Arc onward isn\u2019t exciting in the manga either, one can still find enjoyment in Miura\u2019s ability to flesh out the struggles of side characters. When a character is insignificant in the manga, Miura illustrates them in a smaller proportion than the rest of characters. When a character is evil or possibly so, Miura brushes them with a gloom or an evil face. It is when these elements had gone missing in Berserk (2016) that one realizes what a great injustice had been done to the franchise.  \\n\\n\r\nThat said, this show is good to watch when one expects very little from the show and shuts down their brain. If one considers this show an alternate universe, it may even ease the self-conscious guilt a bit. After all, there is nothing more pleasing than to witness Guts chop down heads after heads of devilish monsters, in the context of a terrible show or not. While you\u2019re at it, with a big, chunky sword. Admittedly, the action also gets better towards the latter parts of the show during The Tower of Conviction chapter. But it is exactly due to the fact that there is more action and less attempts at exposition and character building.\\n\\n\r\nBerserk (2016) reminds me of something I ate which left a bad taste in my mouth. A rusty ham sandwich, perhaps. I still chewed it, regardless, with my decision somewhere in between deciding to spit it out because it might\u2019ve been inedible and deciding to continue eating because I had been hungry after a long time of not having a ham sandwich. If one decides to watch Berserk (2016), it is best to take it with a grain of salt while embracing the nostalgia. Despite the fact that it is exciting for your favourite manga to be adapted into a show, the answer is not always a resounding yes.",

Hack and slash gore-fest.  That's not saying it's a bad show, per se.  It is, however, repetitive and struggles to hold your attention (unless you're one of those who are just out for a gore-fest).  Perhaps the second half of the season got deeper and more complex (I doubt it, but wouldn't know since it lost my interest before I made it past 6), but repetitive endless waves of monsters attacking and killingeveryone except Guts (which the MC's name is guts... WTF kind of writer comes up with that?) as the entire premise of each episode.  There is only so many times you can watch the same thing before you know exactly how each episode will work out before you've seen it.\\n\\n\r\nThe use of CG ontop of regular art was clunky and at times almost nauseating.  Definitely not a seemless implementation.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who gives this ANIME (this being an important term) a high score because of the MANGA (they are two different things, one can be mediocre even if the other is the single best thing on the planet... which this is not) is a waste of a review.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end if you want to watch each of the 12 billion SAW movies.

            "content": "This is my third effort to complete this review. I have never written a preview for an unfinished anime/manga before, neither for one I dropped. I didn't see the point. Also, I didn't like the idea of judging a work that I had not experienced as a whole. I pushed myself to finish the ~750 pages of Red Storm Rising (don't read it) just to be \u201cable\u201d to review it. \r\n\tAfter watching the first episode of the new Berserk I simply had to write something. I retouched this review after watching the first four episodes, as I wasdisappointed that things didn't move towards the right direction. After I finished the series, I thought it was worthwhile to visit the review a third time. \\n\\n\r\n\tI love Berserk. The anime adaptation was reason I abandoned my initial hesitation and started reading manga. Berserk is a genre on its own. And even though the anime is a 1997 work, I still recommend it to my friends. I didn't watch the 2012 movies because of the horrid CGI in the PVs, meaning I was really not prepared when I started this.\\n\\n\r\n\tIt was... well in a single word: Unacceptable. Please don't disregard this comment because I am a CGI hater. Every aspect of it was unacceptable. OK the CGI was horrible,but not only that,  the direction reminded me of old console RPGs, those that you didn't get a good sense of the action. Finally, never in my life, I commented about neither music in movies/TV etc nor about seiyus, I probably have a thick and/or untrained ear, but that episode astonished me because I found that everything in the audio department was appalling.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe anime covers the second act of the Berserk story, following the excellent \u201cGolden Age\u201d arc. While this act is not as good as the first, it still remains a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\n\tDuring the first four episodes you get glimpses of the beauty that is Berserk. Unfortunately you have ugly CGI, poor direction  -full of strangely rotating angles and trite shots- and irrelevant sound. All of the above makes watching the anime unbearable.\t\\n\\n\r\n\tI cannot understand how such a popular source material was given to such an amateurish studio. If you are new to Berserk, you can read the manga. This product does not even come close to replicating the beautiful panels of the original work. If you don't do manga, watch the 1997 anime. It's awesome. On your own risk, you can try this anime if you want to get acquainted with the world of Berserk; if you don't get a headache from the camera work maybe you will enjoy it, or at least whet the appetite for more. I know it made me want to read the manga all over again from the beginning. \\n\\n\r\n\tWhile the production values are worth less than 0, underneath looms one of the best stories in any medium. 4.0/10.",

            "content": "BERSERK... what they did to you? \r\nWhen I first hear of this new anime adaptation of the extremely geourgeos manga of the same name I was super excited, I've been reading Berserk for 13 years now, then I watch the trailer... it looked bad yes, however, I said to myself \" OK come on, it is CG I know, but the movies look good and those are CG as well, if they keep the beautiful CG from the movies there will be no problem\" ... how naive I was.\r\nlets start by the obvious this is a fantastical history, because Kentaro Miura's manga has an amazinghistory to tell, however, viewers need to know that this is a continuation of the first Berserk arc ( golden age ) hence, if you haven't watch or read the original arc you'll be completely lost here. Does the anime tells the history on a compeling and understanbable way? no...this awful anime's director doesn't know how to tell the amazing Berserk story. several important panels from the manga were omitted and that may be confusing for viewers not familiar with the source material. scenes just happen ramdonly without much context as to why or what is happening on screen. the way the director tell the story here is very confusing. however, it's Berserk, the amazing mythos created by Miura is still here... it's just not that polish as in the original source.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk Sound desing shall we? \\n\\n\r\n\"CLANK\" if you watched the anime ( DONT DO IT ) you know what that means, The overall sound effects are awful or even worse ... non existing, it is awfully weird to see something in screen without its corresponding sound effect, for example: somebody falling to the ground without producing any sound, people opening their mouths just to not make any sound ( at least we do not hear it ) pleople grabiing things that do not produce any sound, makes the impresion that nothing exist or have weight withing this world. \\n\\n\r\nSongs are ok...ish I guess, just one Susumo Hirasawa's song thou. and the opening and ending are very forgettable \\n\\n\r\nVisuals: \\n\\n\r\nNot much to say that hasn't been said ... yes, it is HORRIBLE, unappealing backgrounds, awful and weird animations that does not match the audio. almost non existing facial expressions, dead eye CG models even for the main characters, camera's movements that will make you eyes bleed diarrhea and so on. Definitely the worst aspect of the series by a large margin \\n\\n\r\nIt takes little to no effort to realize how bad this adaptation was crafted. It's painful to see one of the greatest manga of all time not being properly adapted to anime, let's be honest, 90's adaptation was not all that good but at least that one had the excuse of being made with the limited technology of the time ( which is not all that excusable because Yu yu hakusho, Gundam wing, evangelion and many other amazing looking anime were created round the same time) but it sure was better that this monstrosity...  \\n",

Most of modern animes would look like a children drawing compared to 97 Berserk.\r\nThis show fails not because of the high quality of the old golden age arc animation, but because it sounds too presumptuous. While watching it I had the constant feeling that the director is trying to show off, I just can tell *what*. \r\nThe animation spins and rotates in weird angles, changes scenes too fast and without a clear connection. Some parts of the fighting scenes look great, some others just look like the director is tryingto give you motion sickness.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music sometimes sounds like the kind of stuff you'd download for free to use as ringtone for your smartphone. It sounds lazy, generic, often anticlimax.\\n\\n\r\nI understand the plot choice. They cut a lot of things, but mostly things that wouldn't really matter right now (yeah yeah, stop crying over the Lost Children Arc). That would be fine if well executed, but it feels extremely rushed. Berserk is action soaked in character development. If you spend 2min of an episode to depict the complex personality of a character like Farnese, you'd better not even bother. The pace is too damn fast, switching between events far apart seemingly randomly instead of focusing into giving the audience the time and depth that they need to feel the characters' feelings and despair. It is just too damn shallow. Unless you did read the manga you can barely follow what is going on.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CGI and the colour pallet choice, we all know that it can be done right (3rd Berserk movie was right on spot) so I can only imagine that the director here purposely screwed it up. The animation, very often, hurts the eyes and fails to deliver the Berserk feeling.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime feels to me like an ***experiment***. It is sad that we are once again losing this opportunity to have the world appreciating Berserk at its fullest. Let's just hope that they will get someone competent to direct Berserk 2017...",

            "content": "I didn't think the day would come where I'd write a review for a show after one episode, but I feel that it's warranted in this particular case.\r\nBerserk needs no introduction. It is among the most iconic anime/manga series period, and for good reason; it's an epic dark fantasy with amazing artwork, complex and interesting characters and amazing writing. The original adaptation might've had its issues, but was still a worthwhile watch. This...isn't. This is not Berserk. I have no idea what the people who created this abomination thought they were doing, but this is not Berserk.\r\nFor one, gone is the expressive artwork of themanga, replaced with ugly-looking and plain character designs that feel so bland and generic that you would think I'm staring at sketches from Deviant-art. This would look poor at best there, but slips into outright horrid and ugly to look at when taken into anime format. I can't believe someone thought these character designs were a good idea. And speaking of artwork, gone are the gorgeous backgrounds in the manga, gone is the incredibly humane proportions for the designs; everything looks like the developers traced over everything roughly with tracing paper, and it looks like absolute garbage.\\n\r\nSpeaking of garbage, the CGI looks horrid; almost no actual animation happens over the course of the episode, and the pacing is jarring and confusing, skipping through massive portions of dialogue (that are present in the manga) and leaving stand-alone watchers confused at what is going on.\\n\r\nThe story suffers because of said pacing, as this constantly jumps between scenes and has no sense of flow or direction, but also fails at being compelling because of the aforementioned factors. No just that, but the story also happens to skip out on a lot of careful character build-up, leaving Guts' characterization with much to be desired and flowing like an edgy teenager whose been on drugs rather than any sense of coherency.\\n\r\nThis is garbage, this is not Berserk. Avoid it like the plague.\\n\r\nthank you \\n\r\nMillepensee, GEMBA and LIDENFILMS for destroing one of the most anticipated anime of 2016 \\n\r\nfinal score 3/10",

If you are a Berserk fan to the core and don't wish to see any negative perception of your favorite show please stop reading and click another review. Thank you.\r\n~Pre-Review~\r\n ~~~~\r\n Oh, hello, you're still here. Sorry if you didn't see me for a minute I was outside taking out the garbage.\r\n*Hand raises from the back of a nonexistent classroom*\r\n Yes?\r\n\"John-sama why are you talking about this, why aren't you getting into the review of Berserk (2016)?\"\r\nAh, me from the past, good to see you and yes I wasjust taking out the garbage which contained a copy of Berserk 2016. Speak of the devil!\\n\r\n Berserk (2016) had so much going for it, I personally was excited to see a different take on the series. Being the fan that I was, I was eager to see what manga arc they would use in the upcoming season. After viewing episode one I wasn't disappointed, the show had just started, and I don't hate CG. Rather it's how the show went about presenting itself, sloppy story, messy characters, and annoying eye hurting animation. So let's dive right into Berserk (2016) and see what went wrong.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~ (Here comes the pain.)\\n\r\n ~~~~\\n\r\n Now straight away we see episode one in Manga territory, however it can't make up it's mind if it wants to stay there or not. I personally found this really aggravating because they had 'it' and they decided to appeal to a larger audience instead of Berserk fans.  It didn't work. I myself am currently reading the Manga, (I'm really trying hard to not cringe to death) Berserk (2016) is a horrible representation to the Manga series.\\n\r\n Who are we to blame for this terrible show? All fingers point to Shin Itagaki and the following Producers, WOWOW, Mainichi Broadcasting System; Hakusensha, Ultra Super Pictures, LIDENFILMS, NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan, Lucent Pictures Entertainment, Docomo Anime Store, Koei Tecmo Games. (It's ironic there's so many. I mean we can't turn this into an Evangelion can we guys? We have to stay on budget.) But back to Shin Itagki, who decided to let this guy produce Berserk? I really want to know what they were thinking when they hired the guy who did such shows as Black Cat & Teekyuu.\\n\r\n *Hand raises from the back of a nonexistent classroom*\\n\r\n Yes?\\n\r\n \"John-sama how can you talk in such disregard for Shin Itagki? I mean he has Inuyasha, (one of your favorites) and Full Metal Alchemist on his resume!\"\\n\r\n Ah thank you for bringing this to light, Me from the past. Mr Itagki did have roles in these shows, however his role was Key Animator. Let's head over to google to check out what that means.\\n\r\n According to Google: \"A key animator is the artist responsible for producing the principal key frames of an animation. Basically key animators draw the essential frames that mark a distinct position or expression of a character in a particular scene. In other words, they draw the structure of a animated scene.\"\\n\\n\r\n~Art~ (Feelin' it yet? FEELIN' IT?!)\\n\r\n~~~~ \\n\r\n Based on the fact that Shin Itagki has more Key Animation on his resume then directing we can come to the conclusion of why Berserk (2016) is hard to look at. Focus shots in Berserk (2016) always change and aren't static. One character should always stay on one side of a shot, the motion should never move otherwise or confusion ensues. The show does this a multitude of times, which in turn gave me a horrible headache.\\n\r\n The colors scream, don't get me wrong I love a colorful show, but this is ridiculous. The color pallet can't make up it's mind, there are so many colors my brain can't differentiate reality from an LSD trip.\\n\r\n Meanwhile, we have this sketched-over animation like we saw in Berserk 1997, however CG animation is laced on top of it?! I want to address this, I am not a CG hater, CG has been around forever and when used right can make a show look awesome. Shows animated in CG like Knights of Sidonia look amazing and feel amazing. What makes Berserk (2016) horse-droppings is that CG is mixed full on with regular animation, and it doesn't even try to hide it. In some instances it's almost as if to say, \"Hey here's our main characters in CG, and here's some supporting characters in regular animation because they're not important at all even though they're animated better!\" The irony flows. The CG is choppy, it's disgusting.\\n\r\n *Hand raises from the back of a nonexistent classroom*\\n\r\n Yes?\\n\r\n \"John-sama, how can you talk so badly about the animation in Berserk (2016), it got better as the show progressed which is a rare thing in anime these days! And I recall you giving the Original Berserk (1997) a great review and told us to ignore the animation!\"\\n\r\n Yes, Me from the past, I did notice it got better as the show progressed. And yea, Berserk is one of my favorite series! However, Berserk has had it's chance, many times. I can understand the first attempt at making the epic Manga to Anime not look so great, I can forgive that. But movies have released and now this series in 2016. I love the original series but I will admit the animation is lacking even for 1997. Princess Mononoke came out the same year and it still holds critical acclaim.\\n\r\n We've had enough time, we deserve a better animated Berserk, the one we expected. \\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\r\n~~~~\\n\r\n The soundtrack is awesome.\\n\r\n *Hand raises from the back of a nonexistent classroom*\\n\r\n*Waits*\\n\r\n Put your damn hand down.\\n\\n\r\n~Character~(Oh Nelly a fires'a'brewin'!)\\n\r\n~~~~\\n\r\n Excuse me for a moment, I think I need to go retrieve that copy of Berserk (2016) from my garbage bin I just took outside to refresh my memory. Because I just can't seem to recall any memorable characters.\\n\r\n Let me address the character that annoyed the living hell out of me. This character needed to die in a Berserk-like fashion but didn't because this isn't really Berserk, (shots fired). Nina needed to die. I have never been so annoyed by an anime character, ever. The Soul Eater NOT(!) cast, take a bow and get off the stage because we have a new winner!  Worst friend award, worst companion award, Darwin award for \"Not wanting to die makes me strong!\" (She actually says this.) No, really?! Anything to make this sorry-ass character feel needed, she's not needed.\\n\r\n Moving on, Puck is horribly presented as comic relief and comic relief only. Where as in the Manga he helps Guts several times out of life-threatening situations, here however, he's just around to make horribly rendered moe faces.\\n\r\n Schierke is shown once and appears on the intro title-card, why? What a waste of ideas! I know shes going to be in Season 2 but really? Show her once and put her on the title-card?!  \\n\r\n Farnese de Vandimion knows what she's doing wrong and yet keeps doing it out of fear of her religion. She doesn't give up her 'faith' until the end of the show and decides to follow Guts instead of Father Mozgus. What a terrible character, I wouldn't want someone so sheep-like following me. (This isn't a spoiler you can see it coming a mile away.)\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\r\n~~~~\\n\r\nNone. You can't judge garbage without taking it out. I forced myself to finish this series.\\n\\n\r\n~Overall~\\n\r\n~~~~\\n\r\nPersonal score of 6/10 just because it carries the title of Berserk. If it didn't carry this title, 2/10.\\n\r\nDo not waste your money on this. Read the Manga instead.\\n",

            "content": "After nearly twenty long years, the anime world finally gets what it was waiting for: the long-awaited animated continuation of mangaka Kentarou Miura's legendary manga series, Berserk. But while the quality of the previous 1997 adaptation was balanced in both story-telling and animation for its time, the anime world has been longing for an adaptation of the arcs after the ever-retold \u2018Golden Age\u2019 arc. Does this new-age contender live up to the hype and the amazing story-telling and artwork that Miura is known for? Let's find out. Obviously, SPOILERS will follow. Ladies, gentlemen, and others, I am Cypherial, the Gaming Otaku, and today I bringyou my anime review for the 2016 adaptation of Kentarou Miura\u2019s Berserk. (INSERT CLANG)\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: \\n\r\n\tThe story focuses on the arcs after the \u2018Golden Age\u2019: \u2018Black Swordsman\u2019 and \u2018Conviction\u2019. The first thing to note is that the writers decided to gloss over the \u2018Black Swordsman\u2019 arc and outright skip the \u2018Lost Children\u2019 arc in favour of the more action-packed \u2018Conviction\u2019 arc. The first three or so episodes are a sh*tshow of fast pacing and awful animation (more on that later), and the first episode in particular is just downright bad. Some characters not even in \u2018Black Swordsman\u2019, \u2018Lost Children\u2019, or even \u2018Conviction\u2019 are introduced right off the bat, and the anime rushes the events in 'Black Swordsman' to set up their segue into \u2018Conviction\u2019. Some elements included in \u2018Lost Children\u2019 are set up in the first episode, such as the introduction of Isidoro's character. It is also interesting to note that this anime is twelve episodes, your standard half-season. Personally, a better way to do this anime would be to have 24 episodes: seven dedicated to \u2018Black Swordsman\u2019, seven dedicated to \u2018Lost Children\u2019, and ten dedicated to \u2018Conviction\u2019 and the climax. Even so, overall I think the writers did a decent job with what they were trying to do. However, some scenes feel out of place without the context that \u2018Black Swordsman\u2019 gives. On another note, some crucial scenes lose a lot of their impact because of the way they were written for this adaptation. For example, Miura himself was involved with the writing for episode 3, which contains the Horse, one of the most controversial and simultaneously crucial scenes in the entire manga. However, because of the way the episode was written, the Horse scene lost a lot of its impact because of its execution and the setting that Miura chose for the episode.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\n\tThe portrayal of the characters in this adaptation are mostly correct, taken from the manga. Guts is portrayed about how you'd expect, Casca as well. The gripes I have are that Schierke (from the \u2018Millenium Falcon\u2019 arc) is in a scene in the first episode with absolutely no context that the average viewer would understand (also the line she says is huge spoilers for the end of \u2018Conviction\u2019, which I guess I understand as foreshadowing, given that they ended the anime right at that point), Isidoro is introduced way before he ever showed up in the manga, and Puck is relegated to a comic-relief/brevity character. On the subject of Puck, yes, I realise that is his role in Conviction onwards, but because the anime glossed right over \u2018Black Swordsman\u2019, the average viewer doesn't get to see that Puck's character actually has a purpose. Moving on, the portrayals of Serpico and Farnese are actually spot-on, which I'm really impressed by given that Serpico is one of the more badass characters in the manga. The only gripe I have towards him is that he has all of two badass scenes in the anime, and one of them is obscured by F*CKING CREDITS, which has nothing to do with the portrayal of the character. Finally, Skull Knight. Badass portrayal, doesn\u2019t have enough screentime (but that\u2019s all on Miura, boys).\\n\\n\r\nVOICE CASTING:\\n\r\nThe voice casting for this adaptation was actually well done. Guts is voiced by Iwanaga Hiroaki, his voice actor from the movies, and he does a very good job, despite him having relatively few lines overall in this adaptation. Puck is voiced by Mizuhara Kaoru, known to me for her role as Amano Rea in Mirai Nikki. A lot of people found her voice to be annoying, mainly because for most of the anime, Puck is portrayed as the colloquial \u201cChestnut Puck\u201d, the chibi rendition of him when he\u2019s to be the source of comic relief for the scene. As a result, the voice for Puck and Chestnut Puck differ in the same way that, for example, Haruhi and Konata differ. We rarely get to hear Puck\u2019s actual serious voice, which isn\u2019t really a plus. Farnese is voiced by Hikasa Yoko, known to me as Weiss Schnee from the Japanese dub of RWBY. Personally, I think she did a fairly great performance as Farnese, however, nothing really stands out to me. Serpico is voiced by Okitsu Kazuyuki, known for his roles as Jonathan Joestar from Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure, and Seishin Muroi from Shiki. Serpico is one of those characters that is simultaneously ditzy and badass, and Okitsu-san really manages to nail down the voice, despite the fact that, like Guts, he really doesn\u2019t have many lines. Isidoro is voiced by Shimono Hiro, known for his role as Katsuragi Keima in The World God Only Knows. I personally am not too familiar with his voice roles, but for Isidoro\u2019s character, I think he did a great job as well. Finally, Skull Knight, voiced by Ootsuka Akio, known for his role as Wammu from Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure and as Skull Knight in the third Berserk movie as well. Perfect voice actor: dark, mysterious, commanding. Love the choice of seiyuu for this character.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: \\n\r\n\tStudio(s): GEMBA, Millensepee\\n\r\nFrom the studios that brought you Teekyuu! and\u2026. not much else, its Berserk (2016)! Personally, I don't know if this was a gigantic troll or if they really just wanted to try and run this series into the ground, but...DAAAAAAAAAAAAMNN!! First thing to note, two animation studios. Never a good sign. One of which has done sweet F-A, the other... EIGHT SEASONS OF F*CKING TEEKYUU! All sense of foreboding dread aside, when I heard that the series would be done in full CGI, I personally was excited. I imagined studio Ufotable\u2019s Fate series, and how well that was animated using CGI, I thought of the Berserk movies which blended 2D and 3D cel-shading, I thought of the brilliant usage of 3D CGI in David Productions\u2019 Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure. I was excited, despite what people thought. But\u2026those first three episodes\u2026they were garbage. The animation was horrible. Utterly horrible. It looked like some fifteen-year-old got a hold of a copy of Poser Pro and pumped this out. Granted, the animation got WAY better for the second half of the series, and they even tried to compensate by throwing in some 2D scenes for the actual events of the anime (not just in flashbacks as they had previously done), but ultimately, the animation balances out to just slightly below average for me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, what we ended up with was decent. But this isn\u2019t just some moe-trash or horror anime that only got made to make boatloads of money off fat neckbeard weeaboos. This is Berserk. This is Berserk, and damn it, the animation had better damn well be able to at least hold a candle to Kentarou Miura\u2019s breathtaking art. \u201cDecent\u201d is horrible for Berserk. Berserk, at the very least, deserves PERFECTION where animation is concerned.\\n\\n\r\nOP/ED:\\n\r\nInferno \u2013 9mm Parabellum\\n\r\n\tThe OP for Berserk (2016) was actually very good. Sure it doesn\u2019t have the horribly-pronounced Engrish and nonsensical verbal nostalgia that \u201cNothing Will Be Wong\u201d does, but to me, \u201cInferno\u201d looks, sounds, and feels more like what Berserk should be. \u201cInferno\u201d basically recaps the Golden Age arc in a flurry of adequate 2D and 3D animation, and you can differentiate which time period it\u2019s in by the animation. The visuals were actually not garbage, despite what Reddit likes to say, and the song did fit the visuals very nicely. \\n\\n\r\nMeimoku no Kanata \u2013 Nagi Yanagi\\n\r\n\tBerserk (2016)\u2019s ED is a very good one. The visuals are simplistic, much like the original Berserk anime\u2019s ending. The ending is basically ethereal outlines of Casca, Isidoro, Serpico, Guts, and other characters on a backdrop of a cloudy night sky which, over time, parts to reveal a full moon. The melody for the ED is one of the more beautiful melodies that I\u2019ve heard in an anime ED, and I can definitely say I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nSOUNDTRACK:\\n\r\n\tIf there was anything perfect about this anime adaptation, it would be the OST. The OST is absolutely astounding, as I expected it to be. The music for Berserk is by and far the best that I\u2019ve ever heard in an anime score, and this adaptation does not disappoint. I only wished they played \u201cHai Yo\u201d a LOT more.\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n\t-The great world of Berserk\\n\r\n\t-No one ever thought Berserk would ever get a continuation ever\\n\r\n\t-Guts cleaving bitches apart\\n\r\n\t-Serpico\\n\r\n\t-Dat ending tho\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n\t-Below average animation\\n\r\n\t-Nina\\n\r\n\t-A lot of cut content from the manga, and skipping the entirety of \u2018Lost Children\u2019\\n\r\n\t-CLANG\\n\r\n\t-Nina\\n\r\n\t-Horrible pacing for the first three episodes\\n\r\n\t-Hey look, more f*cking Nina \\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\\n\r\n\tBerserk (2016) has been one hell of a ride. I went from being excited, to utterly despising it, to being very tentative about it, to being fairly satisfied with it. Ultimately, it is not by any means the desirable or ideal adaptation that we all wanted, but the fact that we even got one at all is astounding. Awful animation aside, I can definitively say that this adaptation is adequate. However, I would not ever recommend this to anyone who has never read the manga, or even seen the original anime. It is so difficult for the average viewer to go in blind and be able to extrapolate what the f*ck is going on. Overall, I pride the anime on its source material and soundtrack, and the fact that the two animation studios managed to save the second half by pulling their heads halfway out of their asses. However, good music design and source material are not enough when it comes to anime adaptations. The execution needs to be flawless for it to take off, and unfortunately, this adaptation had a lot of hiccups. The memes spawned from it are some of the funniest I\u2019ve seen, but ultimately, not even CLANG can bump up my score. On another note, I am somewhat conflicted about the announcement of \u201cSeason Two\u201d, which will apparently cover the \u2018Millennium Falcon\u2019 arc, but we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Hopefully the animation studios and directors learned a thing or two from the problems that this anime had, and strive to fix them in Berserk Season Two. My final score for the 2016 adaptation of Berserk stands at a 6/10. I recommend it only to those who have read the manga, and even then, take it with a grain of salt, as it is not anywhere near the best that it could be.\\n",

Don't even start with the Studio 4C films.\r\nMy solution is to read chapter 1 of the manga, and also watch the first episode of the 1997 Berserk anime. This should give you a good idea of what most adaptations of Berserk are like: cut down because the story is just too large.\r\nIf you honestly don't have a problem with how they abridged it (and admittedly, it's not done poorly, unlike later releases), go ahead and watch the anime first. But keep in mind, you'll only get roughly 1/10the story and not everything will add up by the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnd when you do finish it, do not for one second believe this series is a proper follow-up. I can't imagine anyone coming off Berserk 97 into this and not having an issue.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short: read the manga if you have any interest in Berserk, but of literally all the adaptations, this is the one to avoid. Avoid the Studio 4C adaptations too, for their truly awful storytelling in regards to adapting the source material (insulting to the story is an understatement), but at least they look nice enough, especially for CG.\\n\\n\r\nThis falters in story, though not nearly as bad as 4C, but is overall just an insulting adaptation of a truly epic manga, in both art and adapting the overall story of this later arc.",

            "content": "Now that the anime has been out for a while and those of you who haven't watched it yet probably heard how bad it is. Well to sum it up... Its pretty bad.\r\nThis adaptation takes the manga slams it to the ground and takes a giant dump on it. \r\nStory: It takes what happens in the manga and changes it to an extreme. It has so much to work off yet it skips the majority of the black swordsman arc and the whole lost children arc. On top of that it adds FILLER! Filler in the middle of something that's already happening, it didn't needto be there and it could of just skipped it without any negative effects. So it skips to the Conviction Arc for the majority of the show, its a pretty good arc and it has some amazing moments... Too bad they're summed up and the best fights has the worse camera angles I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The 2D art is Very good. Too bad its mostly CGI and nothing else, when we do get to see 2D its only for a split second and barley anything happens, its mostly just a close up of Guts face. The CGI on the other hand is god awful. CGI should only be 2nd after 2D animation not the other way around while other anime that have god like CGI mostly keep it for OPs or back ground objects/characters for a reason. Guts face changes shape almost 3 times an episode and he looks like he's holding in a shit. \\n\\n\r\nSound: *Clang!* get used to that sound because for some reason steal hitting flesh or steal hitting ANYTHING makes a *Clang!* sound. Other than that its just a lot of high pitched audio sounds that make no sense like why is metal boots hitting the ground making that sound or why did that bomb sound like someone dropped a pan. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Already the anime has a disadvantage because of it mostly being set in the Conviction Arc that is home to the worst side character in Berserk... Nina. Not going to go into detail but she isn't as annoying in the anime compared to the Manga but still pretty bad. Other than that we don't really get to see much of the character development because the Conviction Arc isn't about that Puck's and Guts bond is from the black swordsman arc and the lost children arc and they where skipped and isiro doesn't have one. Serpico and Farnese don't get any character development until the next arc. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: All together this was doomed to fail. Low budget and a director that has no experience with a full CGI anime and poor experience with action anime. His only other action work is the devil may cry anime and that wasn't all that good. So yeah this anime flopped.",

Would recommend watching 1997-1998 version before attempting this monstrosity.\r\nB - Having seen the original series and enjoying it considerably, I was excited to watch this new version. The story seems interesting as much as it follows on from what I've read of the manga/original series, but coupled with the addition of some terrible characters and worse art style, it's hard to watch.\r\nArt - 3\r\nA - 70% of the time, thecharacters looked janky af. That time when he swung around a ledge tho.\\n\r\nB - The trailer looked interesting at least. Maybe a mix of 3D and 2D? No, the intro ruins the show by looking great whereas the show looks awful. Nice 2D intro, disgusting 3D characters who move like they're made of wood. Also, somehow uglier than the original series.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5\\n\r\nA - While the clang from the sword in the beginning was satisfying, it eventually grated as there were few other sounds of merit.\\n\r\nB - I hate the clanking sound. He wasn't fighting washing machines at least, I didn't think so. The music was pretty generic/uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3\\n\r\nA - I went into this not caring about the characters as I hadn't watched the previous series. I left not caring about the characters as they had no meaningful development throughout the show.\\n\r\nB - As I said before, the characters that were introduced following the original series I couldn't care about in the least. The thief kid who followed him around - why? None of the characters brought anything interesting to the table, which wasn't helped at all by the wooden look. On a side note I did enjoy the main villains (minus Father Ted) who lasted all of 5 seconds.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3\\n\r\nA - I wanted to enjoy the show because the concept is quite cool - however the execution was poor so I couldn't enjoy it.\\n\r\nB - Although I did like the villains a little more than anything else in the show, it was really just a difficult watch. With all the characters showing less articulation of joints than most trees, and the fact that the show didn't look that nice in the first place it was quite a slog and wasn't very enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4\\n\r\nA - Big sword, no character.\\n\r\nB - Clang went the skeleton.",

The manga clearly doesn't have this issue, however. \r\nThe series has one main saving grace, and that's the music.

I think guys tha the anime could never show all details as manga can do. I must recognise that i didnt read the manga but i saw some pictures in it and it seems amazing. I wanted first to watch all this series, and after i will definitely read the manga too. If i would read it i think my impartiality abour series and also my enjoyment would be totally diffrent now. So this an opinion, letting the manga outside, just about the anime. In fact the anime was the one which convinced me and make me sure to read the manga. \\n\\n\r\nStory is not presented as well as in the manga, im sure of it, but again it is about the anime, not the manga. So storry is 10, rarely seen in the anime world a more captivating and complex story as here. \\n\\n\r\nArt have many minuses, but the idea of it was good in my point of view. If they would be more careful on some aspects this anime could be much better with this kind of art. There are many details about it that bring this minuses and it is useless to speak about each one, but still i think the idea was good but wasnt well finalised(maybe using a low buget too) so i will give 7 for it because it could make me anjoy it anyway and after a time could make me pass about all the details being focused more on what heppens there.\\n\\n\r\n Sound was very very poor. I think is the worst thing in this anime. i Would give it maxim 2 if there wasnt that amazing OST there, but some was also put on the wrong time, so i can give just 4. But i still listen all day that OSTs, they are one of the best in anime history i think. Also i dont think the open theme fit too well for this kind of anime. So there was a part of the team which made an amazing job, a part of the team which made a really bad job, and this is overall and this made me feel always a contradiction about this anime\\n\\n\r\n About characters i think they show almost what they should(even if they appear sometime not with enough emotion like some kind of robots, but the emotion can be felt. 9\\n\\n\r\n Overall is 9 despite the minuses, Berserk story remain a masterpiece and the anime could make it enjoyable in my opinion(if that stupid sound was better...that is the fact that made me think a time about giving that 9). I know it can t be 10 but in my list i put it as ten because with all this minuses it was one of not many animes that really made me enjoy it. In this case comparation with what could be or with the amazing potential lost there is useless. I think in the end it metter the most how i felt about it and after a time it really could make me ignore all that detail that in so many eyes it appeared as a bad anime. My english is poor, i know and i am sorry about it, but i can recomend you to try it despite all this hate, how i sayd, i really think it deserves a chance. Hope you will enjoy it enough.\\n\\n",

            "content": "*Disclaimer*\r\nJust personal scratch.\r\nAdvised, possible spoilers.\r\nOpinion & Informal\r\nNote #1: I watched the Blu-Ray version of this series. From what I understand when coming into this, this was notorious for terrible movements and model quality. Furthermore, I also heard that some of those problems were alleviated in the BD releases. I am writing this review based on the BD versions.\r\nNote #2: I normally consider a show as is. I don't prefer to compare a show to its original such as a manga or light novel, but in this case I will be since I believe that the original manga for Berserk is a masterpiece and it stillremains as one of my favorite manga ever. I will be making comparisons between this 2016 adaptation and the original manga in regards to the pacing and overall timeline. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10 CGI models and CGI backgrounds/environments. Certain scenes such as closeups or minimal animation shots were drawn instead and looked more like conventional anime. There wasn't any clipping of the models that I could notice. The detail in the CGI backgrounds was particularly unappealing. The only decent model was that of Guts himself. There was an acceptable amount of work done on his model. The models of every other character looked like \"clay-mation.\" Overall anatomy of the models looked fine. Proportions were fine for the human characters. Rugged-realistic art style. I don't really care too much about poor art/CGI quality in this case in particular. My first biggest problem with this show is the absence of impact-shots. The original manga is quite known for its absolutely breathtaking 2-page spreads. It's almost a meme. You can expect a masterfully done 2-page spread in almost every mid to later chapter of the manga. There was none of that translated in this adaptation. There should have been more clear, dedicated moments for those. There were some efforts such as showing the impact-shot facial expressions of Guts when he's about to go wild on the beasts or monsters, but those too weren't as dedicated as I would have liked. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/10 The general movements such as walking and running looked fairly believable. However, everything else was either terribly done or compensated with cut-shots. For example, the body language and mannerisms of the characters were either very stale or stiff. It looked like some of the characters were staring into space when conversing or in dialogue. Another example in regards to the cut-shots would be whenever Guts would swing his sword. Pretty much every time he swung THE DRAGON SLAYER it was animated in a cut-shot fashion with a slow-motion tailing end of the sequence to add flair. Some parts such as the fight with the angels in the Tower were animated decently enough. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10 I love Guts. Well, I love Guts during his Golden Age and his early Black Swordsman. I'm not too fond of the recent direction that's been going on in the manga. The characters were all here in this adaptation. Some characters were at parts of the timeline where they shouldn't have been, but I can overlook that as I understand the time constraints this 12 episode adaptation may have had. I don't think this adaptation clearly captured Guts. Guts feels like another Jotaro from JoJo. Maybe it's the VA? I'm not sure. It just didn't feel like the Guts I know from the manga. All the other characters were captured in an acceptable way. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 5/10 There was clear artistic freedom going on in this adaptation. I don't appreciate it one bit. I can understand it, I guess, but I don't appreciate any of it at all. Some characters were at places in the timeline where they weren't supposed to be, certain parts skimmed over, certain parts altered, etc. I'm giving this a 5 because only minor changes were made. There wasn't a complete retcon or anything. The overall story was preserved and the minor changes were trivial. They were most likely done to speed up the main development and get to the Tower arc quicker. \\n\\n\r\nDevelopment: 5/10 Begins the Black Swordsman journey and ends at the conclusion of the Tower arc. Since I'm familiar with the development in general because of the manga I'm not going to be too serious on this part. What I can say though is that the parts that were supposed to happen, happened. The people Guts were supposed to meet, he met. Some areas of development seemed to be rushed such as the side stories of the secondary characters but whatever. This is Guts' story. The developments when he was concerned happened at an acceptable pace and time. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 4/10 Pretty much one main battle and hype theme. Did not use the catchy OP in any of the scenes which was disappointing. Other bgm was unnoticeable or not even there. Soundboard was pretty underwhelming. Sound design nothing of note. My favorite part though was the, \"CLANG, CLANG, CLANG, CLANG\" part. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 6/10 Leaves off at a pretty good spot. Continuation-ending that wraps up the Tower arc and isn't a blatant \"Watch S2 please!\" ending. Not much to say here as well. It answered the questions presented in the Tower arc. It wrapped up certain relationships and initiated some goodbyes as well as meetings. This conclusion was fine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10 This anime felt like a budget JoJo. The sound effects and air that Guts gave off in this show all just felt like a copy and paste JoJo. It also felt like a child-mature show, not a mature show. I feel like the studio was trying to make Guts more likable I guess? More cooler I guess? I appreciate that the Black Swordsman part of Guts' journey was even adapted. For that reason I'm giving this a 5. It's not bad, but it's not fine either. Maybe when another studio decides to take up the challenge and do something like this, I'll reconsider my overall score. \\n\\n\r\nCLANG, CLANG, CLANG.",

            "content": "Short note: If you want to get started, don\u2019t watch this anime. Read the manga or watch the movies/90\u2019s Berserk beforehand and then consider if you want see this or not.\r\nStory: This anime could had gotten a 7 or 8, if it were not for episode 1 and 3. The reason is that this anime choose to pick the forth arc as start while easily breeze through the two remaining arcs before that wasn\u2019t the Golden Age.  Story wise, both Black-swordsman and Lost Child Arc doesn\u2019t evolve the main plot and serves as explaining the world, however it does introduce us to our charactersand develop them throughout the harsh world.  Forcing down two arcs of character and friend development between Puck and Guts in just 2-3 episodes is quite risky and could easily backfire. Even if they did get the original author to write the plot for episode 3, it still does not have the same magic as it was written in those two arcs.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, this series was faithful of adapting the arc they focused on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: One of Berserk biggest strength is the presentation. The violent, sexual and surrealistic theme of the series goes well to the realistic design with details Berserk had on it's foreground, character and background. The amount of details animator had to match from the source material is one of the hardest tasks of adapting Berserk to video format. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show fails. They have cut corners and it shows.\\n\r\nWhat we have here is CG that tries to mix with 2D but can't since they lack details, choppy 2D animations, low framerate and a lot of duplications of models. However the saving grace from what makes this have any lower score are the stills, the background and postcard memories.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: With everything sound as it should be, the only sound effect that sticks out is when Guts swings his sword. As some may have commented, it sounds like a frying pan and should not be welcomed. I however takes this as a guilty pleasure which adds to the overall enjoyment of this show.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack does not impress me. With exception of OP, ED and Hai Yo, there's no other music that ever left an impact or was noticeable.\\n\r\nThe sound effect is fine but nothing noticeable, with exception of the CLANG effect.\\n\\n\r\nNo real problem with the voice actors however.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As I mentioned earlier in Story, some character development on the main character is lost. Although the characters didn't suffer as much as the story and acted as close to the source material. With Mozgus bashing people with his book, to Farnese pyro fetish to Luca being the best women she could be.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I wasn't looking forward to each episode, but I also was. I was looking forward to see if there was any improvements, but I knew it was too late. Simple as that.",

Casca is reduced to a blabbering mess that I'm surprised that they even took the effort to cast an actress for. I suppose some would make the argument that in the aftermath of the Eclipse that her mind would have been shattered. That makes no sense, however, when put under the lens as several female characters in the show endurethe horrors that they are subjected to. Farnese and the two prostitutes are completely fine after a night of PTSD inducing demon attacks, and Farnesse doubly so after nearly being raped by a horse and possessed.\\n\\n\r\nGuts has no real purpose now. He's just flitting from battlefield to battlefield ruthlessly murdering any angel/demon that gets in his way. I suppose that's fine if the viewer is looking to get into a battle anime, but there's few of those key battles where the characters are pitted against worthy adversaries.\\n\\n\r\nThere's little emotional investment going into this show. It's your typical damsel in distress and tough guy needs to save her spiel. Which is sad since I've wanted to get into the manga for some time and this is an indictment of the source material.",

            "content": "Skip to the end of the review if you don't want to climb this giant wall of text(and crying) that I wrote. This review is based on MY OPINION. You might like Berserk(2016) and you might also disagree with me and my gripes with this anime. Also, english is not my native language so bear with me.\r\n\"You don't WATCH Berserk. You read it. And you enjoy it.\" - Berserk 2016 does it's best to prove this statement. Berserk(1997) was one of the first anime that I have watched. Even though I prefer \"light and happy\" anime and manga, I liked it. When I first foundout that Berserk will get an adaptation I was extremely happy. And then - CGI came in. I thought to myself - well, this is going to be bad, but it still might work out. Berserk movies had CGI in them and it wasn't too bad. CGI can be a great tool for creating action scenes and it might allow this anime to become a masterpiece, because action in Berserk is incredible(yet it also has a good story and characters). That was pretty stupid of me. \\n\r\nLet's start with the cons:\\n\r\n1.Art:\\n\r\nWhen the first episode of Berserk came out I jumped right into it, full of hopes and dreams about how awesome it's going to be. A-a-a-nd it turned out to be a lot of worse, than I was expecting. Art shocked me - it felt like I watch some sort of poorly-made fan-parody. Models with dead expressions, weird shadows, nauseating frame rate - all the good stuff. But! It get's better! Art shoots itself in the foot by replacing poor CGI with a hand-drawn animation during some scenes. Because of that you can clearly see how bad the situation with art is. It destroys immersion completely. And it get's worse and worse with each episode, because it looks like that at some point, guys that were responsible for the art, decided to add more of the 2D \"goodness\" to the CGI mess they've made. \"But it's a good thing!\" - you might think. Wrong. Why? Well, imagine this: on the left half of the screen there are poorly drawn static characters and on the right side of the screen there are poorly made CGI characters. By the end of this anime I would hysterically laugh each time I see that sort of \"high quality art\". I have CGI PTSD now! Oh, and it's not just about \"art\" itself. Action scenes directed in a worst kind of way. Weird transitions, weird angles and stiff-poker-face(as dead as this meme)-expression on the !thin! face of Guts! Berserk with a kuudere Guts. Simply amazing. Because of the poor art atmosphere is created solely through characters and sound. And even then - if you watch it in HQ and pay attention to details - it burns. And it burns even worse when you notice all the half-*censored* censoring. Women have no nipples. Yep. Berserk with no-nudity and extremely toned down violence. All in all, it turned out to be so bad that I decided to read the manga version of Berserk and after I did that fell in love with it. Art(even first chapters look good), atmosphere, characters, story - everything about Berserk manga is great. Only because of that could I continue to watch this seires.\\n\r\n2.Story:\\n\r\nLost Children side-arc is nowhere to be found. I read the manga and because of that I can understand that studio had their reasons to exclude this arc from the adaptation, especially if you consider how heavily censored it already is. From what I've learned from words of Reo Kurosu(Berserk(2016) producer), Kentaro Miura wrote the original script for the first and third episodes of this adaptation. You can watch interview with Reo on YouTube. In my opinion Lost Children arc is very important as it has a lot of moments that demonstrate true nature of Guts and the world he lives in, and well, it has some EPIC moments that make Guts look like the incarnation of Death itself. On the other side - I guess it's good that this arc didn't get an adaptation. With the art that this series has, it would look and feel terrible. Still #feelsbad though.\\n\r\n3.Sound:\\n\r\n\"CLANG!\" - this is what makes Berserk 2016 to be the best comedy anime in this season. Dragonslayer is not empty inside and zombies/knights/apostles/clots of ectoplasm/skeletons are not made of frying pans. Later on it is replaced with different sounds, but still sounds weird. And considering the fact that I am talking about Dragonslayer, it is:\\n\r\na b s o l u t e l y d i s g u s t i n g \\n\r\nNow to the pros: \\n\r\n1.Story:\\n\r\nYes, I included it in both pros and cons, same goes for sound. Story is good, because it's Berserk and Berserk has a good story. Adaptation adds some interesting details to the world of Berserk and for the most part(look at cons) strictly follows the source material.\\n\r\n2.Characters:\\n\r\nIt's the same as the Story. Berserk has good characters and because of that adaptation also has good characters. \\n\r\n3.Sound: \\n\r\nOST of this adaptation is amazing. It greatly increases immersion(but art spoils it), sounds good and unique. I myself enjoy the OP song, and find it very fitting. \\n\r\nVoice actors did their best to bring stiff 3D models to life. Voice acting is superb. \\n\r\n\"CLANG!\" - just go to YouTube and search: \"Berserk clang\". \\n\r\n------------------------------------------\\n\r\nSummary: \\n\r\nStory - 9:\\n\r\nStory is great thanks to the source material. Lost children mini-arc is missing, but story as a whole is still good. \\n\r\nArt - 1:\\n\r\nIt is terrible. It is disgusting. Some people get over it, some people don't. And I couldn't stand it.\\n\r\nSound - 8:\\n\r\nThis adaptation has great OST and voice actors did their best to bring their characters to life.\\n\r\nCharacters - 9:\\n\r\nCharacters are great thank to the source material. And thanks to the original script of Miura Kentarou, some of them get additions to their personalities.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5:\\n\r\nMusic, voice acting and story were good. Art spoiled all of it. \\n\r\nOverall - 5:\\n\r\nI can't say that it was a bad anime. It has a good story, and it also has interesting characters and soundtrack. But I also can't say that it was a good adaptation. Adaptation should bring characters to life or at least increase this effect. If adaptations fails to do it - there is no need for that adaptation to exist. And sadly, Berserk 2016 suffers from that. Characters look less alive than they did in the manga(How do you even fail that badly, guys?! Your moving characters look less alive than motionless characters!). But! They have voices, nice fitting voices at that. And because of that they at least SOUND alive. And just think about it. If you're a Berserk fan - you should watch it. Because you will do it anyway, right? If you're new to Berserk, or if you don't know anything about it, you should skip this anime, at least for now. Go read the manga, or watch the Berserk 1997 and only after that give Berserk 2016 a chance.",

            "content": "This one's a mixed bag. This anime adaptation of Berserk adapts the Binding Chain and Birth Ceremony sections of the Conviction arc where Guts comes at odds with the Holy Iron Chain Knights, who seek him out for supposedly being linked to a prophecy that will bring ruin to the land if he is left unstopped.\r\nWhere Berserk's quality takes a hit to a great degree comes from its first half. Before this anime came along, only parts of the Black Swordsman arc and the entirety of the Golden Age arc were properly adapted into anime form between the 1990s TV anime and the later filmtrilogy. This creates some issues with the narrative of the anime since some elements to the manga's plot are not properly fleshed out due either to being left out of earlier anime adaptations or the Lost Children section of the Conviction arc not being adapted into anime form. A good deal of alterations and changes were also made to elements of Berserk's story in its first half to introduce characters earlier than they would appear in the manga, change up the circumstances with how the Binding Chain arc starts by mixing it with a story from the Black Swordsman arc, and removing some scenes that hinted to the major development to come in the Conviction arc's finale. Basically, the anime wanted to adapt the mentioned two parts of the Conviction arc, yet had to get to it in a haphazard way that impacted the show's pacing and plot development in major ways since some major story elements were not properly explored due to parts of the manga's storyline being cut from the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, the major plot developments of the Conviction arc remain intact with Guts dealing with the knights and later having to rescue Casca from them when she is captured. In addition, major characters introduced in the arc like Farnese and Nina get properly fleshed out and get some developments that change their views of the world and personalities for the better in spite of the horrific events that escalate into Berserk's second half. Berserk's second half is also much more faithful to the manga unlike its first half with little differences between both adaptations and whatever was added or removed not significantly altering the anime's narrative too significantly compared to the first half. Still, the anime ends inconclusively since its events would continue into the Falcon of the Millennium Empire arc, that will apparently get an anime adaptation next year in Spring 2017.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of presentation, the Berserk TV anime employs CG animation similar to the Golden Age arc film trilogy yet with a TV budget in mind as the character rendering and animation looks quite rough and stiff at a number of points throughout the series despite maintaining the appearance of many of the character designs used from the manga. The soundtrack also has its fair share of issues from employing J-Rock for a number of its musical tracks which clash poorly with Berserk's intended mood as a dark horror/action medieval fantasy series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a rather mediocre attempt to adapt one of Berserk's later story arcs. While retaining the major story elements and mood of the series, the show's attempts to build up its major conflict in its first half have some rather haphazard narrative direction coming from a combination of its fast pacing and some elements of Berserk's story not being properly fleshed out due to removed sections of plot and a full part of the Conviction arc. A rather underwhelming effort of an adaptation as epic and famous as Berserk.",

            "content": "Well, it's nice to finally have a full adaptation of the Berserk manga. The manga is a huge chunk to bite off, so this anime takes a few shortcuts by omitting what are essentially filler arcs of the manga (like the one with the insect girls in the forest) and just sticks to the main point of introducing the characters and getting Guts' group together. \r\nThe biggest shortcoming is the art. The characters all look more like robots than people, with empty eyes and expressionless faces. I understand the use of CGI since there's so much source material to cover and probably scant time todo it in, but greater care should be taken with the design of the characters, such as Attack on Titan did with its beautiful character design.",

Animations are stiff, facial expressions are shallow and fake. Otherwise decent characters suffer a whole lot from that. Music, when it gets noticeable, seems misused a lot.

Second of all, the fact that the anime is CGI, does not mean it is bad. Sure the artstyle may look very shitty, but once you get used to it, you will care more about the story than the actual art style. I personally never read the manga (I'm the type that does not like reading manga on the internet and needs the manga to be in bookform). But the story is good. If your planning to watch this, I assume that you've have watched the 1997 version of berserk, where the ending was kinda *uhh ya know fucked up*. But if you haven't seen the 1997 Berserk, go ahead and watch it first. Because if you start with this, you will lose lots of context. Overall, I rate the anime a 8/10.",

I loved the characters, I loved Guts, and even though it broke my heart and seemed excessively brutal, I loved the ending. \r\nSummary: I looked forward to a continuation of this anime for a long time but was disappointed. If you watch this, just consider it a weird spin-off because it has lost nearly everything that made me enjoy the original. And I know it is biased to judge a sequel off the original, but I can't help it, this new installment was just that disappointing to me...\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nWhatstory? This is probably the lowest I've ever rated a story. Guts is searching for Casca and wants to kill his demon-ex-friend, she's wandering randomly around acting like a child. Supernatural stuff keeps happening since he's marked and killing tons of random bystanders. He gets trailed by some random side characters for a while that either admire or hate him, but the story is literally just: \"look, Guts is a badass and defeating all this shit that keeps being thrown at him!\" \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10 \\n\r\nThis show uses 3D scenes and lot of CGI assists. So you get these awkwardly smooth rotation shots like in Kingdom. I didn't hate it but it does take some getting used too. The action scenes are incredibly brutal and badass though. Fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nI'm rating this as mediocre but I don't remember the sound much. It was ok I guess. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nGuts is guts at least. Mad and on a rampage. He's a brutal killing machine so they preserved that part of his character. All other characters have pretty much vanished or are sidelined though. Casca has reverted to a childlike state and wandered off, constantly in danger and a nuisance. I hoped to see her progress but not this season. She remained a broken disappointed shell of the original character and yet another example of a strong female lead destroyed by something like rape. Granted, it was with a demon, and no doubt traumatic, but childlike reversion is just an over-the-top emotional slap in the face to people that liked her character. She is literally only there to justify Guts' brutal rampage. If she wasn't there he would honestly look like a criminal and a jackass most of the time. All side characters are fairly 2D this season as well. Even guts is 2D. So you basically just have this static cast moving around bumping into each other and never changing much. Maybe they expect to have several seasons? Regardless it is a bad start. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I knew that if done right, for example get the treatment Hellsing, HxH 2011 or Drifters got, that it would be the best anime ever. Nevertheless since the first episode started, I felt like crying blood, because it was HORRID. \r\nStory\r\nOne of the major issues was this. The creators skipped not one, but two whole arcs, and thanks to that, I knew that things will not be going in the direction that we the fans deserve.It tried to overwrite the first episode from the first anime, while still not being as it was in the manga. Characters that should've been killed, died ahead, and our MC was made very weak in the beginning, which if you are familiar with the source material, Guts (MC) is the most badass character in manga. After they skipped all this material though, they followed (kind of) one arc, even though it was still underwhelmingly executed. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was THE WORST I have ever seen in my life. I am not a huge fan of CGI, nevertheless I have watched CGI shows, and compared to them, this looked like it had the Food Fight rendering, it was so horrible that I could barely watch it, to make things worse, where there a group of people, they drew them with the same design, it felt like the animators didn't care about the show at all. What was most shocking though, was the fact they used 2 D animation for some portions of the show, and it looked phenomenal. Why didn't they do it like that ? I mean, if you want to keep your animation quality poor, then stay consistent, don't add great animation for a second, and then for 15 minutes use crappy one. If this anime had used the animation from the original Berserk anime that was almost 20 years old, it would've still be better than, the art we got here. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nWhat can be said about the sound, it was almost as consistent with the art. Whenever there was a fight, you could hear a *CLANG*, like Guts' sword is a frying pan. It was disgusting. Don't get me wrong, I would understand if there is a sound like that, if he fight opponents with armor. However there was no such thing. The only redeeming quality though, is probably a little bit of the voice acting. Some of them were trying, the others were like emotionless puppets. \\n\\n\r\nI can't say that I would recommend this to any Berserk fan, but people that are not familiar with the story, and want to lose some time, can give it a shot, and if they resent it after the first episode, than watch the original anime and the movies, they are far superior in quality and production value than what we got here. I am surprised that we will get a continuation of this anime, and I hope that they will mend their ways and give us a far better season, than what we received with this. Albeit I am sure that we will suffer again with the sequel. At least the manga is a GODLY experience.",

            "content": "After decades since the original series ended, the badass swordsman returns in an adaptation that looks like a cutscene from a video game: Berserk! A lot of people had high hopes for this series' return, and most of them were disappointed. Personally, I thought it was neither good nor bad. While I admit, the anime had its own good qualities, there were moments where I skipped some scenes because I found it boring.\r\nPeople accused the anime as being bad simply because of the 3d animation. added more depth to the characters' physical aspects, while not excluding comedic expressions. There's really nothing wrong with the animation,but I just couldn't get into the series because of it. 3d is fitting for some series, but not this one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was mediocre. As much as I love Berserk, this one didn't really catch my attention. Again, I don't think it's bad or good. It's really up to you what you think of it.",
