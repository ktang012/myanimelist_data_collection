Phos' journey in Land of the Lustrous (Houseki no Kuni) is a compelling exploration of a person who desires to change themselves, both physically and mentally. Studio Orange's adaptation of Haruko Ichikawa's manga is unlike any anime you've ever seen. Stunning CGI, visceral yet graceful nature to which it portrays bodies, and a dense analysis of the human condition make it unforgettable.\r\nIn the distant future, Earth has been ravaged by six meteors. The meteors broke offparts of the planet and formed six moons. Earth has been reduced to one single shore and the rest of the planet is the ocean. This single shore is, while beautiful, has entirely infertile land. Only one organism populates the land because they don't eat food from the planet, they photosynthesize. Evolved from the organisms that live in the depths of the ocean, they became beautiful gems who reflect sunlight with every move they make. \\n\r\nCreatures that live on one of the moons known as Lunarians travel down to Earth to capture the gems for their own personal desires. The prettier gems being the most desirable. As long as the moon hangs above the characters' heads there is a constant feeling of fear for their lives, in turn creating constant tension for us as viewers as we can never be sure if a character may be swept away or shattered into pieces (and no amount of perceived plot armor will stop them). We constantly see a full moon in the background of the show with gems framed below its vastness as if it is preparing to encroach upon their temporary safety.\\n\\n\r\nLand of the Lustrous tells the story of the youngest of the 28 gems, but they\u2019re all immortal so being younger than a thousand-year-old being is still quite old. Our main character Phosphophyllite brought to life by Tomoyo Kurosawa\u2019s exquisite performance that is able to get to capture such a wide range of emotion and tone, is inherently relatable thanks to a lack of seriousness and plenty of recognizable mannerisms. \\n\\n\r\nPhos ranks near the bottom of the \u201cMohs Scale\u201d used in real life as well, which dictates how high or low a gemstone\u2019s hardness is on a scale of 1-10. In the society they live in, if you\u2019re born with a low hardness then you have no choice but to take on a role suitable to you, but if you have a high hardness you\u2019re expected to protect the others in combat. And because they\u2019re immortal, roles are permanent. Unchanging. It\u2019s a roulette that\u2019s spun for the gems, spun for us all. It doesn\u2019t matter what body you get because you\u2019ll be stuck with it. It\u2019s up to you to decide what to make of the body you\u2019re given. However, Phos is so useless in their society that they fill no niche or role. Thanks to their upbeat and irreverent personality they\u2019re able to live optimistically, if pointlessly. It's a stark image of the unmotivated youth, struggling to find direction or even motivation. An image that I resonated with immediately. And more than likely you will too or, at the very least, you'll appreciate the direction Phos takes to better themself and help their fellow gem suffering from a similar struggle, Cinnabar.\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the show Phos is descending into pointlessness (almost like an actual rock), berated by the other gems for a lack of talent. They say things like \u201cAre you good for anything?\u201d and \u201cYou don\u2019t do anything at all\u201d. It\u2019s all played off for laughs, if a bit mean-spirited, but the truth is, Phos only has a 3.5 which is so low that they\u2019re not even allowed to fight. Phos would fall to pieces if they were shot by just one of the arrows the Lunarians use. Phos comes to hate the limitations of their body, regardless of how desirable the Lunarians find their peppermint green color. And there are other gems who envy Phos for their desirable color, of course without Phos fully understanding that they have qualities worth being jealous of. This is just one of the many ways the show incites introspection, saying that we all have some notable qualities no matter who we are. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Phos doesn\u2019t technically break themselves, throughout the show they throw themselves into danger with the desire to be broken, hidden beneath their silly personality. Through being broken with intense physicality and repeatedly being put back together with a light but audibly satisfying sheen, Phos grows to become a new person from who they originally were. After all, if the gems lose a piece once broken, they lose an equally sized chunk of their memory. So occasionally after a battle, one of them may forget the name of the other, but in the more drastic cases later on in the show there are harsher consequences. In one of the most chilling moments of the show, Phos is beckoned to danger by an unseen force (assumably their desire) that says \u201cYou must change.\u201d It\u2019s that horrifying feeling we all have at one point, and Land of the Lustrous delivers fear-inspiring moments like these every now and then, but most of them come in the later episodes. These moments successfully connect the viewer to the central character and their turmoil by giving them vivid fever-dream visualizations. Phos\u2019 journey is the main narrative throughline of the show, and thank god for that because seeing them grow and learn more about their world makes for a rewarding adventure indeed. The main character isn't the only suffering from inner turmoil. Every gem has some sort of anguish that torments them. Even Diamond, with a hardness of 10.0 who Phos idolizes, feels great envy for the slightly tougher Bort. These subtle nuances to each character aren't shoved onto us either. They\u2019re minor details, subtly woven into the script so that the generally upbeat mood doesn't become melancholy, but it's enough for you to pick up on so it will feel rewarding to see their progression in the background of Phos' story. \\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake, this is not only a compelling journey through the main character\u2019s struggle against themself, or even about the three-dimensional supporting cast that serves as foils to Phos. It's about bodies, how they deserve you to live in harmony with it rather than in spite of it.\\n\\n\r\nBodies are treated as sacred totems in Land of the Lustrous. To place them in the purest form possible, gender is removed entirely, each gem referring to the other with they/them pronouns only (as I have thus far). They\u2019re quite literally artifacts that glisten in the sunlight. The gems are constantly framed with vast negative spaces to highlight how valuable their beauty and vibrant color is to the desolate world they grace by inhabiting. Also, the director repeatedly frames the gems in symmetrical shots as if they are the focal point of a work of art, hanging in a fine art museum. Even the more enigmatic supporting characters like Bort and Antarcticite are portrayed with beauty and elegance through their immaculate fighting style that each gem uses. The fighting choreography appears as graceful as a ballet dance but has the visceral impact necessary for them to take on a fleet of eldritch creatures. The action is unlike anything you\u2019ll ever see. And it\u2019s brought to life amazingly with the most stunning CGI I have ever seen in a TV series. The previous works of the director Takahiko Kyogoku includes another CGI oriented show (Love Live! School Idol Project) and it really shows because he\u2019s improved on that show\u2019s animatronic dance numbers in just about every way. Action scenes are where the director shows us his best abilities, and they only get more impressive as the show progresses. The \u201ccamera\u201d work during action scenes is so dynamic. The smooth camera motions coupled with the fluid movements of the characters makes for scenes that devour your attention entirely. Even during the scenes with less motion, the gems are still quite vibrant. Their vividly colored hair and reflectiveness that causes light to bounce off of them makes the show, at the very least, always eye-catching. \\n\\n\r\nThe respect that each gem\u2019s body is treated with makes it all the more distressing when they\u2019re shattered in combat. This, coupled with intense visual and audio feedback, makes the combat to be some of the most thrilling action I've ever witnessed. Even though the gems are immortal, there is still a fear for their lives, if they are broken and become immobile then they will be trapped in their bodies forever. Endlessly. Arguably that is a fate worse than death. Even worse, the Lunarians may repurpose you into a weapon or jewelry (as seen in episode one). \\n\\n\r\nThe orchestral soundtrack backing most scenes maintains the mystifying tone of the show and is fantastic throughout. Music swells during combat and during some scenes, it matches the instruments the Lunarians play when they come down to capture a gem. Sound effects are also incredibly satisfying on the ears; the sheen of a gem being put back together after a tough battle, the airy wisps of the cloudlike Lunarians, the clinking sound that can be heard as gems walk across the marble floor of their home. Lustrous is never harsh on the ears yet it has an intense audible impact. Both the opening and ending credits are quite good. The ending Kirameku Hamabe especially shouldn't be understated. With fear-inspiring images of the moon, the poison metal alloy that flows around Cinnabar, as well as a few references to the later turns the story takes, the ending perfectly encapsulates the darker themes of the show. To contrast this, the song that supports the visuals evokes hope.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond just being an audio-visual wonder, Land of the Lustrous is an analytical masterpiece. The director brought excellent talent to the table, but the source manga by Haruko Ichikawa deserves credit for being rich with symbolism. Thankfully, this carries over into this compact but well-paced adaptation. Not a second of screentime is spared. When we\u2019re not being delighted with the funny and whimsical script, mesmerized by the visuals, or sometimes all at once we\u2019re being delivered the themes through visual imagery.\\n\\n\r\nThe thematic throughline in Lustrous follows the idea of change. The changing of one's self, the change that Phos and their fellow gems desire. As such, concepts like death and rebirth are constantly showcased with symbolism. When are gems are broken, they\u2019re placed in black bags that strangely resemble body bags. It\u2019s as if they\u2019ve died are being remade once the doctor puts them back together. This intrinsic connection the show shares with death also explains why each gem wears a black tuxedo resembling funeral attire. As if they're all in a constant state of mourning for the pieces of their comrades (and selves) that are lost in battle. The show is also doused in Buddhist imagery at nearly every corner. Whether it be the enigmatic \u201cSensei\u201d that all of the gems respect and rules over them like a deity, the ritual-like behaviors and designs of the Lunarians, and the frequent references to rebirth. If you know about the Buddhist philosophy, you\u2019ll know the goal of the religion is to relinquish the body that carries your soul so you can be liberated and proceed on to Nirvana. There\u2019s even a scene in which a certain character is supposedly reborn as a small animal to more suit the karma that they obtained in life. It can\u2019t get any more clear than that. But in action, like everything Lustrous does, the results are absolutely mystifying. Seeing all of these different concepts clash together with great visual quality and artistic direction makes for one of the most bewildering yet beautiful experiences ever.\\n\r\nNo details added to Lustrous were done so without reason, everything is purposeful. Everything is necessary. It may have helped that I was learning about Buddhism in tandem with Lustrous\u2019 tv airing, but knowing of these themes definitely enriched my experience. Keep in mind, there are many interpretations with such an abstract and ambiguous story like this one, so you may find different meanings in the show from the ones I did.\\n\\n\r\nBefore closing, it's worth mentioning that as the source material is still ongoing, this anime does not have a complete ending. Enough plot lines ended on a satisfying (if incomplete) note, and a few new ones were opened to give you a sense of the direction of the next season will take. The story is not over so I will be patiently awaiting the second season, but until then I\u2019ll be happy to dig through the show\u2019s lore and alternate meanings as there is plenty of rewatch value.\\n\\n\r\nLand of the Lustrous is, for the most part, a joyful adventure that may even inspire laughs, but let your guard down too long and the Lunarians will steal away all you hold dear leaving you devastated. At its heart, it is a pure and simple story about how impossibly flawed we are as people. How we'll always search for means to become better, endlessly until we finally reach the end of the cycle. Whether or not this series has all of the answers, you'll want to listen to the tale it has to tell about the questions.",

            "content": "Absolutely beautiful, Houseki no Kuni sadly flew under the radar of a lot of people due to the lack of initial hype, but I hope this changes over time because this anime really deserves a lot of love.\r\nThe setting is so interesting and full of mysteries and unknowns to discover, what happened to the world to become like this? Who are the gems, or the moon people that seem to be after them?  Houseki knows how to make the events ocurring hooking to watch and it's such an enjoyable experience from start to end.\r\nAlong with the intriguing story we also have a fantastic castthat brings it life, the characters are inmortal humanoid gems with the qualities that represent them (like Diamond being the hardest mineral, but relatively easy to break in comparison), their interactions are interesting, varied, and at the same manage really funny when the situations requires it, this anime handles very well the comedy and it fits nicely without breaking the mood of the scenes. Phosphophyllite (or Phos in short) is the protagonist and goes through fantastic development over the duration of the series, becoming a very memorable character.\\n\\n\r\nNow it's time for the art department and I will be honest here: if every CGI anime has to look like Houseki, god, I want so many more of them! The animation is amazing and had some scenes where I just had to replay them of how good they looked, and the excellent cinematography that goes with it just makes it even more impressive, with some shots that left me speechless. The use of this type of animation is also really fitting considering the constitution of our characters and for details like how they can break depending on the situation, which looks better with this style.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also a strong factor of the series, always fitting with the tone of the scene and improving them, the theme that plays when the Lunarians appears gets an special mention from my part because it never failed to make me shiver, so unsettling. The opening and ending themes are also great in both song and visuals and grew on me as the series progressed, definitely playlist worthy.\\n\\n\r\nHouseki no Kuni was an unique and fantastic experience I really recommend everyone to try out, you won't regret it.",

            "content": "The GRRM Reaper once posited the Furniture Rule: that at its core, literature is an exploration of the human condition; the rest is fluff, furniture.\r\nHouseki no Kuni begins as a simple story of immortal, genderless life forms, the Gems, with each individual based around a gemstone from which they take their physical characteristics. They are being hunted down by Lunarians for what seems to be collector\u2019s fancy. Slowly, the story moves on, teasing the layers of mystery of its world and a more intriguing aspect of the entire dynamic unravels, one more conducive to philosophical discourse. The introduction of a third faction, the Admirabilis, elevatesthe nature of their conflict and is poised to bring the series higher should its story continue.\\n\\n\r\nThe CGI nature of the show doesn't really take away anything from the narrative but rather enhances and prepares it with its CGI portrayal of the three factions telling a story: the Gems, with their janky yet solid movements, aimless and unmotivated beyond mere survival; the Lunarians ethereal and eternal, purposeful in action; and the Admirabilis, frills and filaments galore, excess made manifest, seductive and ephemeral.\\n\\n\r\nUnderneath the trappings of a fantastical concept, however, Houseki no Kuni is a thesis of how our place in our world is intricately intertwined with our purpose. It's a story about identity. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a story of Dia, valued, vaunted, a tier above other gems, yet struggling to find a moment in the light under the vast, dark shadow of a peer better and stronger.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a story of Cinnabar, self-exiled, isolation poisoning the mind, bereft of a shoulder to lean on.\\n\\n\r\nMost of all, it's a story of Phos, aimless slacker, wanting to do more than just making an encyclopedia that has no equivalent value assigned by other Gems. Phos wants to fight, swept up in the idea that Gems prove their worth in the only way their circumstances allow: fighting the Lunarians. Phos' initial value was demonstrated when, devoured and broken to bits and pieces, the grim, though temporary, fate evoked nothing but cruelly nonchalant reactions from fellow gems. \\n\\n\r\nHow can someone so brittle prove their value when, to paraphrase Einstein, the fishes are judged by their ability to climb a tree.\\n\\n\r\nHouseki no Kuni\u2019s approach to the problem is a rather straightforward one. Instead of changing the playing field to a pond, our little fish is given an opportunity to be better, losing parts of itself in the process. Part of its identity must give, in the hopes that the best version of itself can be achieved. And that hopefully the best version of itself is its truest self. Whether it\u2019s true or not remains to be seen.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I must say, this conflict of identity and the show\u2019s solution ties in fully with the larger, grander aspects of the narrative: the three factions, each crucially lacking traits the other two possess. Can the three factions be so much more together much like how Phos had become much more than the Mohs scale of hardness? We'll see.\\n\\n\r\nFor now, enjoy one lost little fish trying to scale a tree, struggling to find the right balance lest it loses sight of who it is.",

            "content": "Over the last few years or so, it seems that the discussion regarding the use of CGI in anime has grown all the more prominent, and for perfectly good reason too. It appears that more and more shows are using CGI to greater affect, which is generally brought with much disdain with anime fans. For shows that use CGI in accordance with the use of traditional 2-D animation, the end result is usually one that comes across as jarring, as the two modes of animation juxtaposes awkwardly with one another, with scenes that end up feeling clunky or strange. It usually ends up dragging meout of my immersion of the show, since it doesn\u2019t make visual coherent sense, and often the CGI sticks out look a sore thumb, with this season\u2019s Inuyashiki being a prime example of that, constantly intermixing both modes of animation haphazardly into its action sequences. With shows that are fully CGI, this jarring contrast is pretty much eliminated, but many suffer from poor production overall since the CGI is often rather ugly looking, with the two recent adaptations of Berserk being the king of this! Both shows feature some of the most poorly produced CGI action sequences I have ever seen, where most of the time it looks like two puppets awkwardly rubbing up against each other instead of them fighting! And there are many other shows like this too, so it\u2019s no wonder why fans look at CGI with such disdain and actively try and avoid any shows that utilise it, which is perhaps why this season\u2019s Houseki no Kuni, or Land of the Lustrous if you will, was so under looked within the community, which is a shame too, since, to make a frankly overused and terrible pun, Houseki no Kuni is the gem of the season!\\n\\n\r\nMuch to mine, and many other\u2019s surprise, Houseki was a breath of fresh air, not only from typical CGI oriented anime, but for anime in general, with a wonderfully creative setting, lore and personality-filled characters! While Inuyashiki was a disappointment, Houseki is the salvation to said disappointment, with each passing episode, making me fall in love with this show all the more, and why it certainly is not perfect, provides me with a seasonal show I actively looked forward to watching each week, which hasn\u2019t happened since Dragon Maid earlier this year. But, I\u2019ve babbled on for too long now. Let\u2019s actually dive in!\\n\\n\r\nSet in the distant future, Houseki no Kuni tells the story of a group of genderless gems, all of which have differing personalities and characteristics, who, along with their master, a bald monk with insane powers, have to fight off against a race called the Moon Dwellers - a race of strange creatures who descend from said place to capture the gems! The series sees our main protagonist, Phosphophyllite, come of age in this world, slowly becoming more independent and stronger as the series progresses. Houseki has this way of immediately immersing me into its atmosphere and world, not only through its wonderful use of music and beautiful looking scenery, but just from all the little details the show provides too. The fact that each gem has specific characteristics, and are classed in accordance of their strength, the fact that they can be broken into tiny pieces and stuck back together again, that they can lose their memories if certain body parts are missing, that they have to hibernate over winter as they grow weaker and tired, and that they can potentially be combined with other elements for different affects are all things I can appreciate in making the show way more interesting and fascinating to me, and these elements are often used in creative ways for either characterisation or as elements for advancing the narrative. It\u2019s the use of these creative elements that makes Houseki such a wonder to watch, and helps to differentiate it from much of its ilk; its these elements and ideas that I can\u2019t get anywhere else, but they are not simply played as gimmicks either, but as an integral aspect of the setting and narrative. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the show has this overbearing sense of mystery, and almost whimsical sense to it as well. Much like our protagonist, Phos, who knows nothing of this world, so do we as an audience, so we experience the world and learn new things about it as does Phos, which not only helps us grow more attached to this character as well, but the rules and mysteries of this world are dished out to the audience in a consistent pace, keeping the narrative interesting and fresh. Moreover, the show has several mysteries as well, such as what the true nature of the Moon Dwellers actually are or the state of humanity, evident in a scene where Phos is trying to recollect the events that transpired earlier in which she (yes, for the sake of convenience I'm going to be referring to the gems as \"she\"; I apologise for being a CIS white male and assuming gender) can\u2019t remember as she had lost some of her body parts, but mentions the word \u201chuman\u201d which greatly alarms that of the Sensei, the guardian and father figure of the Gems, giving us insight into the seriousness of the memory Phos has, and sliding little hints to the audience about the true nature of the Sensei character himself. The show even dabbles in some philosophical ideas too in the fifth episode, regarding what it means to truly be human and what it truly means for someone to die, as the very concept of death is foreign to the Gems, and while it is not explored to much substantial merit, the show does throw around this idea, making the Gems feel more believable with a greater sense of purpose. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s even a genuine sense of narrative stakes and ambiguity too, not only from the idea that we never know when the Moon Dwellers will attack next, but the general sense of uneasiness the narrative presents too. There\u2019s always a sense of danger in the air; a sense of looming dread and fear, which permits itself into much of the narrative, which actually does a good job at making me fearful for each one of the Gems, and there is a genuine sense of sadness and melancholy when one of the Gems is defeated and taken away. You feel the weight of this loss, as the other Gems do, making it all the more powerful when these moments in the show do occur. The show does leave many questions unanswered however, and some plot points haven\u2019t yet been resolved as the manga is still running alongside the show, but what the show does cover manages to provide a solid foundation for a second season to greatly build upon, with enough time in this season devoted to establishing the world and the way in which the gems work in said world, all of which is solid enough to stand by itself I believe.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the show\u2019s biggest strength is in its characters and their charming and fun interactions between one another, and, despite not each one receiving development or attention, their unique personalities and characteristics result in some wonderfully funny moments and scenes which makes the characters rather likeable, and these were some of the best moments in the show for me. They all have delightful chemistry, and one of the best examples of this great character dynamic is a scene in which all of the gems freak out at seeing Phos\u2019 newly gained abilities and seeing how each different gem reacted was pretty damn sweet, adding onto their respective characters. All of the characters, in some form or another, is given some level of introspection and time to breath, allowing the audience to understand their perspectives on the world, from Yellow Diamond\u2019s perception as a result of being the eldest, to Antarcticite regarding her unique, and isolated role during the winter, all adding onto our understanding of the world. There are plenty of characters I could talk about, but I\u2019ll just discuss the characters with the most bearing on the plot. \\n\\n\r\nPhos, our main character, is one in which is a representation of a child growing up in harsh world, and learning to mature in that time. Being the youngest of all the gems, and wanting to grow and prove herself, she eagerly jumps into action in order to do so, resulting in many accidents in which she has to either be saved, or put back together. You may find yourself kind of annoyed by how much Phos messes up at first, since it seems that almost every episode she ends up having to repeat this process, but these mistakes end up shaping the person she will become in the future and aiding her development. As the series progresses, and she realises the gravity and danger of fighting against the Moon Dwellers, after seeing one of her friends perish protecting her from them, her character embarks on a change into maturity, with a much more serious demeanour than before. In the final episodes of the show, she even reflects on her past self, stating that she was jealous of her immaturity, reflecting in her change of character as a result of the harsh reality of the world. Phos character, while perhaps coming across as maybe rather obnoxious, especially in the beginning of the series, was still able to make me laugh a numerous amount of times and I could excuse most of it on the grounds of her age and lack of knowledge about the world. Her character is pretty reltable as well, since we too have been in postions where the world seems to treat you like a child, and that feel of wanting to desperately grow into maturity is one Phos manages to encapsulate rather well. She is also pretty damn likeable, I would argue anyway, which helps the audience to become more invested in her character from the get-go, and the mental trauma and hang ups she faces in the latter half of the series is genuinely interesting. Much of Phos\u2019s drive in the narrative, mainly in the earliest parts of it anyway, was her desire to help a fellow gem by the name of Cinncibar, a gem who secluded herself away from the rest since her body secretes a poison. While you may find yourself kind of frustrated at first since this plot point is kind of negated for a while, it does see some kind of resolution in the final episode of the show. \\n\\n\r\nAnother character whom gets a nice amount of development is Dia. Aside from being best gem in the series (seriously, I wanna hug her so damn bad) Dia\u2019s development, and character arc in general is all about proving to herself, and to the person whom she loves, that being Bort, that she is more than capable of looking after herself and in the tenth episode of the show, there\u2019s a wonderful moment where indeed she does do so, when fighting off against one of the new Moon Dweller types, cementing her character as one that is grounded in the narrative, and has a lot of emotional weight behind her too, so much so, that I generally care for her whenever she is in danger or feeling melancholic, and many of the characters presented in the show are like this too. Whilst many are fairly simplistic, again, they feel like genuine people in this world, and have enough in the way of distinguishable personalities to carry the emotional weight of the show, while also showcasing different levels of complexity and depth, such as in the case of the Doctor of the gems, who we learn later on pursues the art of the gems in order to help her long lost friend, or in the case of Antarcticite when she hugs the sensei, believing nobody is standing there to see her do so, revealing a softer side to her character than we were led to believe at first. The characters in this show are easily the strongest element and is the main reason why I had so much fun watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, Houseki is pretty damn solid overall! The CGI in this show looks damn amazing, and move with not only a lot of fluidity, but also quality too. They move gracefully when in combat, and it never comes across as jarring or clunky in the slightest. I also just love the designs for each of the gems too, in particular, their hair. I love the way in which it sparkles, gently illuminating the gems\u2019 uniforms, with perhaps Dia looking the greatest in that regard. The fight sequences are also of a damn great quality, with dynamic and interesting cinematography, and just the way the grass is animated too, and how beautiful it looks, are all small things that I can appreciate, and, again, help the world feel more alive and vibrant. The OST for the show as well does a fantastic job at immersing me into this world, with its often whimsical and mystical tone, complementing the sense of ambiguity the narrative tends to encapsulate. The opening track as well does a great job at capturing the feel of the show, mainly used to represent the loneliness and isolation of Cinncibar to master fall affect.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I loved Houseki quite a fair bit. It\u2019s narrative and world is immediately captivating to me, its characters all feel memorable and have wonderful chemistry between one another, grounding them in a sense of believability, and the animation is some of the best I have seen from a CGI production. Surprisingly, the director of Love Live, actually directed this show too (goddam Love Live will follow me until the day I die, I swear), and he did a good job, especially when we compare the CGI in both respective series, and see how much of a jump Houseki was in overall quality. While certainly not a perfect show, Houseki represents what I love in anime, and that is passion. It feels as if so much love and work was put into this production, and it really does show in many faucets of the show, and I would greatly recommend this. While I didn\u2019t go into as much detail as I usually do when reviewing a show, as I wanted a potential new viewer to watch this show without knowing too much, there is still a lot of potential things to discuss regarding the narrative, with the biggest one being the obvious allusions to that of Buddhism the show seems to have, which I never even touched upon, and a deeper speculation into the sensei character and who he truly may be. Houseki, is truly the gem of the year in my opinion, and sadly one that will be greatly over-looked, but hopefully I may have convinced someone out there to give this show a shot\u2026 maybe. (Just remember to say that Dia is best gem or else I'll sleep under your bed at night!)\\n",

            "content": "It\u2019s unfortunate that many people overlook and under rate CGI based series, me included. But after reading the synopsis and watching 4 episodes, I\u2019m glad I made the decision to watch Land of the Lustrous. I guess you can say this is the\u2026Hidden gem of the season \\(\\~_~)\r\nOut of all the anime that aired this Fall, Houseki no Kuni caught my attention the most. With its oddly intriguing story along with the setting and characters. The characters of this series are gems. You know, Diamond, Jade, Alexandrite, and the other ones. Each gem has a certain hardness, how easy they can break. One of thevery weak gems are our main characters, Phos and Cinnabar. I did not do any research so I have no idea about how each gem acts and their exact information. But the anime does well to explain enough the characteristics of each one.\\n\\n\r\nBasically the Gems or Jewels task is to fend off against like, Moon Dwellers? They constantly fight the gems to kidnap them for the purpose of decoration. Of course, being gems, it\u2019s understandable. With this, Land of the Lustrous does well to present an action packed, scenic filled, colourful, atmospheric anime for us to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Phos, her task doesn't come with badass fighting scenes, her (I know they\u2019re genderless, so i\u2019m just gonna refer to these as girls cuz they're more feminine than anything else) job is to write down notes for an encyclopaedia and make history. Not so fun is it. Being an easily breakable gem, Phos had it coming.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is quite amazing with its catchy opening and insert songs. The sfx used as well is amazing and the overall music just fits perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is definitely a strong point, despite the CGI that it has. It flows nicely and the action scenes and cinematography is spot on.\\n\\n\r\nI am pretty tempted to read the original source to see how it differs, but I do hear that the adaptation is pretty well made, so no complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting performance of course is very good as well, each character has an appropriate voice for those characters. It fits and it makes me feel for them more.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for this series is beyond the roof. To the calm, SOL feeling situations, to the action packed and serious scenes as well. Although the tone shifts could make people see this series differently, I do believe it has a more positive impact than a negative one. I enjoy each character and the different types of jewels and the use of their \u201chardness\u201d rank. I love how some gems are fragile and some aren't and they use that nicely in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime needs more attention, just because something is cgi, does not mean it can\u2019t present a good story driven anime with good characters within a good setting. Houseki no Kuni deserves a lot more. If you have time at all, I really do recommend watching this anime, because It won't be a waste of time.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I am writing this review because I believe I hold an uncommon opinion. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s spoiler free. Allow me the time to tell you a story.\r\nOnce upon a time, a little boy was shopping at a mall with his mother, when he passed by a brightly lit shop window sporting an inviting neon sign at the entrance, labelled simply \u201cCandy.\u201d The display case under the sign had a large, swirly lollipop in it, each swirl being a different color. Eager to satisfy his taste buds with the sweetness of a candy he has never ever seen before, the boy tugged on his mother\u2019s coatcollar, begging for her to buy him the seemingly delicious treat.\\n\\n\r\nThe mother, not even bothering to look at the price tag, took a single glance at the ridiculous lollipop and told her son, \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it, I\u2019ll buy you something else.\u201d Being a stubborn little boy, he sat down onto the floor and refused to move a single step. Exasperated, the mother led the boy into the shop and paid for the candy.\\n\\n\r\nThe boy, overjoyed at his victory over his mother, licked his lollipop with vigor. After a few licks, he noticed the lollipop didn\u2019t taste proper. Taking a look at it, he noticed that he\u2019s been blending the different colored swirls with his disobedient tongue. Despite realizing this, the boy noticed that there was nothing he could do to salvage his ruined lollipop. Not knowing what to say to his mother, he finished it silently. \\n\\n\r\nLater that night, the mother asked the boy, \u201chow was that lollipop?\u201d The boy, not wanting to admit his own wrongdoing, plastered a smile over his face and replied, \u201cit was great.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the moral of this story? There are a few.\\n\r\n1. Just because something is new and fancy, it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s good.\\n\r\n2. A weird blend of themes and flavours will not always leave a good taste in your mouth.\\n\r\n3. Mainstream consumers do not want to admit the faults in their initial judgement.\\n\\n\\n\r\n<Artstyle and initial thoughts: 10/10>\\n\r\nHow does this relate to the anime Houseki no Kuni? It should be quite clear. The \u201cinnovation\u201d in this series is the usage of CGI. In the brief history of anime I\u2019ve had the pleasure of experiencing, there has not been an instance where CGI was used well. Naturally, a show that executes a controversial style well would receive positive attention. Admittedly, the artstyle for this show suited its purposes well enough, so I have no complaints. In fact, talking strictly cinematography, art and sound, this show is unparalleled at creating an immersive atmosphere. Now, if that\u2019s the case, why did I imply that the show \u201cisn\u2019t good?\u201d Speaking of the show\u2019s purposes, you\u2019ll see soon enough.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is complicated in many ways. Plot, characters, setting, all of it. Allow me to clarify. Complex shows are not intrinsically bad, in fact, that\u2019s far from the truth. However, shows that end up complex due to blatant execution issues are BAD. Not even god tier art can carry such an aimless, thoughtless story.\\n\\n\r\n<Setting and Plot: 3/10>\\n\r\nLet me start with the setting. The worldbuilding in this show is highly fantastical, and the explanation behind how everything ended up the way it was sounds like something a 13-year-old whose idol is his geologist grandpa would come up with. Sure, it\u2019s ludicrous, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with a good laugh, but I digress. The premise of the show is surprisingly amazing for philosophical explorations on rational sentience and immortality. On top of that, the CGI artstyle compliments this setting very well, leading to some extremely beautiful scenes. Sounds like fun and lollipops, right?\\n\\n\r\nNo. Here comes the plot. The first two episodes work to introduce the characters and the world, but it suffers from a major writing issue. It leads you to believe that this show is a social commentary emphasizing on the hierarchical nature that results from self contained communities, and how each character suffers as a result of their own mental insecurities and lack of identity. That doesn\u2019t sound too bad, if it actually followed up with what it set itself up as.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a series of slimy (ha, ha.) events, you find yourself in a confusing spot halfway through the show where you start to wonder where this show is going. Remember what I said about the setting being an optimal one for philosophical exploration of unique themes? You actually get some of that. Just three lines of dialogue unrelated to the plot, then the show wants you to forget about everything that happened in the first half of the show in favour of some shounen style character development, which is carried out for the remainder of the show, to my massive disappointment. Sadly, the first half of the show provided weak narrative exposition at best and pretentious, irrelevant babble at worst, and this was actually the good half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nDo you like repetitive, meaningless fights with no emotional implications or plot strings attached to it? This was the case with most of the fight scenes in Houseki no Kuni. The typical end result of each fight is that our main character \"develops.\" You'll see what I mean.\\n\\n\r\n<Characters: 2/10>\\n\r\nDon\u2019t we all love that classic slice of life \u201cconclusion,\u201d where a stupidly dramatic event drastically alters the characters beyond recognition, in a weak attempt to add dimension to the cast? Wait a second, I hate that. Referring back to the plot section, I mentioned that the first two episodes set the show up for a character oriented exploration? I guess it wasn\u2019t completely off the mark, if Dora the Explorer is your type of \u201cexploration.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is usually defined by a single, one dimensional trait that dominates their entire character. This is evident in Diamond, Cinnabar and Bort. The rest of the many characters are not worth mentioning. There is some very weak development by the end of the show, but this was not the anime\u2019s focus.\\n\\n\r\nMy dear Phosphophyllite. You developed so much, its almost as if you underwent a chemical change (pun and sarcasm intended). This character\u2019s journey of self discovery was the aim of the show, yet her changes are not only inconsistent with her former self, ridiculously dramatic, but also violates the laws of chemistry. The sequence of events that led up to who the character became by the end of the show was definitely the result of inadequate planning and incompetent writing, evident by a chain of stupidly dramatic incidents that served no other purpose than to turn Phos into a more dynamic character.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps you don't agree with my criticism that Houseki no Kuni's characters lack depth, if you've seen the show. It's difficult to argue this point without spoiling anything, but I'll say this: our only knowledge of Phosphophyllite is her current desires and motivations, which progress from a linear lack of self worth to a sentimental attachment to a certain dead character following a short time skip. Both of these plot devices lack narrative backbone and portrays Phosphophyllite as incredibly shallow and her actions extremely simple. There was not a point in the show where I questioned the motives or psychological states of a single character, because this shallowness is present in the entire cast. There simply isn't enough information or character exploration in the show.\\n\\n\r\nMy last point lies in my disappointment that the basic premise of immortal people was not evident at all in the characters\u2019 behaviour. In fact, every member of the cast acts like a 21st century high school student, which ruined the immersive atmosphere the art desperately tried to create.\\n\\n\r\n<Final Thoughts and total score: 5/10>\\n\\n\r\nIt may be clear by now, but my biggest issue with this show is the obvious lack of direction in its narrative, mismanagement of dramatic structure and insignificant ending. I am aware that the anime does not adapt the entirety of the manga, but hey, I\u2019m just reviewing what\u2019s here right now.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show? If you\u2019re interested in sitting through a 12 episode tech demo, be my guest, but don\u2019t place many expectations on the storyline to provide a compelling analysis of a theme, or the characters to bring any entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nI will reiterate that the art was beautiful. There is no denying that. After all, isn\u2019t a big, swirly, colorful lollipop enticing? Just don\u2019t forget, mommy warned you...\\n",

            "content": "I have to say... As of writing this review only 4 episodes have aired, but I'm confident enough to say that watching this anime is a very uncomfortable experience. \r\nIf you don't already know (like I did at first) this is a CGI based anime (think RWBY and the like). Now, I have no problem watching anime or shows created in this style, but there were a lot of issues with how this was executed, which really detracted from the show. But more on that later.\r\nStory - 4\r\nThe main premise of this show is that there are these humanoid gems that are assigned specific jobsbased on their hardness and gem type. Our main character, Phos, is the weakest gem and is assigned the task of recording new information into an encyclopedia because she is too weak to fight. Meanwhile, the gems are being attacked by beings known as \"Lunari\" who want to use them because they're valuable or something.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot seems simple at first glance, but it actually is quite convoluted. I blame this on the fact that there are many characters and when there are many characters, it becomes difficult to focus on the big picture. I honestly still don't know what the main objective or plot of the story is. \\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming part of the story is the fact that it sticks to the world building. I think it would be very easy to ignore the world the characters live in and pretend as if it doesn't matter, but it's refreshing to see each episode incorporate parts of the world and its volatile 'nature' into the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 1\\n\\n\r\nThis is the biggest problem in the whole show. I know that art style is very rarely important enough to affect the quality of an anime, but this is one of the exceptions.\\n\\n\r\nI will concede that SOME parts of the CGI animation are done really nicely, to an almost impressive degree, but unfortunately it does not make up for how often the CGI isn't that great.\\n\\n\r\nYou will begin noticing this from the very beginning of the first episode. The show is LAGGY. Characters will in one moment be flying across the screen, kicking bad guys in the face, and then in the next be struggling to move their arm 10 degrees. It's honestly really annoying and it happens A LOT. Even in some of the more important scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nThe worst part is that it tends to lag on the character's facial expressions, making them look stagnant at places or just awkward. It kind of deprives the viewer from a part of the character experience because half the time a gem is trying oh so hard to move her lips before they cut to someone else.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the fact that some characters just look better than others. Not in terms of design, but in terms of quality. I mean, I don't understand why the gem master has to look better than our main character. It's like looking at one character without your glasses on and then looking at another with them on. That's the only way I know how to describe it. \\n\\n\r\nI will admit that I'm the type of person who believes that CGI in general, in its current state, is not pleasant enough to look at. Live action movies can get away with it because for the most part, the scenes with CGI are brief enough that you don't notice the flaws or there is only one thing that needs to be animated. Making a show out of it is just... ugly. Making a show out of it and having it constantly lag is annoyingly ugly. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 4\\n\\n\r\nI can't tell if this is a problem with the CGI or if the voice acting just isn't that great. The characters often sound lifeless, but it may just be because the CGI is so terrible at times that whatever the VAs are saying doesn't match up with what we're seeing. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are great though. I'm not sure if they fit the show in particular, but they're catchy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5\\n\\n\r\nLike I said earlier, there's a ton of characters. They're all mostly tropes with a few things that distinguish themselves from each other. They're not bad, but not really memorable either. Overall it's pretty average.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRight now, I don't really enjoy this show. I blame it mostly on the CGI and I feel as though it were in a more traditional style, it would be easier to watch. I don't think it's a terrible show, but I do feel as though the CGI turns people off, as it should. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is that the show is not strong enough on its own to hold up this new style. The plot is okay, but it's not memorable. No one is going to look through their watch list and remember the story in vivid detail. No one is going to be making highly analytical posts about this show. The CGI doesn't add anything to the show, but there are about a million little details a traditional style could add. \\n\\n\r\nAt best, the show will entice viewers to read the manga, which artistically represents what this show is about while still preserving the quirky designs of each character.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "At the time of writing this review, four episodes have aired.\r\nI've finished catching up to the manga (60 chapters) and will be purchasing them shortly. \r\nSTORY: Gems in humanoid form fight unknown entities known as the \"Moon-People\", their hardness and gem type dictating their overall strength and ability to fight. The story has a very distinct feel to it, but I'm not surprised only about 20k people have this show currently listed. Although great in my opinion, it's rather niche. If you're into sci-fi type stories, this is for you. Don\u2019t just write it off as some \u201cSteven Universe\u201d rip off, because 1) it wasmade before S.U., 2) it\u2019s a worthwhile view/read. Later on in the series it will get a but off the rails and the feel of everything is turned on its head. Needless to say, dark. Despite the drastic shift in tone, I still would highly recommend watching until the end. The pacing is about one or two chapters per episode, and I find it fitting. It doesn't seem drawn out or too fast, which is great, especially for a twelve episode series. The tone shift that will occur in later episodes will without a doubt ruin it for some viewers. It all feels very left field for some, which is understandable. Just a point I wanted to bring up.\\n\\n\r\nART: Similarly to the manga, it has a very cool, stylish, and clean-cut art style that is very appealing right off the bat. Although not extremely detailed like other manga in the current market, the style has such a unique atmosphere that others lack. I feel like a lot of people dislike the 3D, as they look back to the ONA's 2D animation and find it better than what we received. However, I find it rather fitting. The ONA showcased lackluster animation, which, though most likely would have stayed more true to the manga (and allowed for more expressive animation), looked relatively odd. In the new artstyle, the hair's shine and the facial expressions are actually gorgeous, and the character mannerisms are cute and energetic. I can't wait to see how they adapt the more...\"exciting\" parts of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The sounds of clanking and cracking that the gems produce are VERY nice, as it, well, sounds like gems. The voice acting is very relaxing, smooth, and high quality. Phos' voice is rather irritating, but it's fitting for their character. I\u2019m a native Japanese speaker and I have to say that the actors are really into their role, and their emphasis on certain phrases or lines just makes the character acting so much more effective in my opinion. Especially Phos, as they have a very childish way of speaking and the VA does an amazing job of portraying this. The others aren't as noteworthy, but are stellar performances nonetheless. In terms of music, gorgeous. The OP and ED weren't favorites at first, but now they've grown on me and I LOVE them both. The OST used in the series is really nice, especially the battle theme. I can't wait to hear what other songs come out of it. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Staying true to the manga. Some characters' colors are being changed from the originals to better reflect the gem they're based off, and personally, I find these versions much more appealing. (Diamond, Morganite.)\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: Recently, I finally got around to binge-reading the manga, as I had started a while ago but never finished. Of course, I can't say much on that (spoilers and such), but I can't wait to see how they adapt some characters and their designs, as well as more exciting action scenes later on. I love Phos, I love the story, I love the sound...But Houseki No Kuni will only be receiving a 8/10 for now, as it has yet to display to me the peak of what it can accomplish with this adaptation. I hope to see a season 2, as I'm sure the 12 episodes that will be airing cannot cover most of the manga as it is. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR; If you don\u2019t like the CG or aren\u2019t intrigued by the plot so far, you might as well skip as it\u2019s very niche.\\n",

            "content": "I will only say that as a \"veteran\" anime viewer I look for things that feel original and a departure from stories and devices that I have seen many times already. This is why I decided to check this and boy, I enjoyed it so much.\r\nTake into account: this story is darker than it seems and based on an ongoing manga. The anime does not provide a final closure for the story. Anyway, I enjoyed it a lot and certaily recommend it.\r\nStory: 9\r\nIntriguing. There is a central mystery to be solved and many other things we don't know. But the story so far is progressingat a good pace and giving us new bits of information every episode. Also Phos, the main character, is going under certain development. I've read that there are surprises coming our way and I have my theories about it, so I am excited to see what will happen. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 \\n\r\nI love the use of CGI here (this is a 1st for me), I started watching only for the pretty. The show is visually stunning, some action scenes are plainly jaw-dropping. The sceneries are awesome and the gems are shiny and wonderful. I don't mind that they look a bit rigid being CGI, I would expect a crystal to be sort of stiff, so for me it works. The story and dialogs are more than enough to make me feel they are full of life.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nAll the gems have distinct personalities and I like Phos, the main character, she is weak but stubborn and desires to be a useful part of society, she struggles and is not there quite yet. It feels relatable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIt started as a light entertainment with lots of eye-candy. But after episodes 3-4 the story gets more intriguing, the characters predicaments more complex, and I was hooked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10\\n\r\nI have to give it a 10 since this anime has left a lasting impression in me. The production values are high, the quality of animation (and music, and voice actors...) is superb (unless you truly dislike CGI). The story is innovative and characters are fleshed out, although we only follow major development for the protagonist, Phos.",

            "content": "Now I have finished the series, and it has brought me great enjoyment. There are moments that I laugh, I cried a bit and cursing Phos for being so useless or so annoying. But slowly, I realised Phos character is so relatable. \r\nIt is very common for us youngsters to dream an ambitious dream, while not realizing how much effort and pain one have to go through before one can achieve that dream, and eventually hit hard by the reality. It usually starts off as \"it's so cool, I want to be like that.\" to \"I am not good enough.\" \"I wish I could bethat good.\" \"why couldn't I become as good as 'that someone'.\" \\n\\n\r\nMany of us might not truly accomplish something even though we thought we had tried our best. Or there are moments we felt so helpless and just wish to hide and take cover, think that the pain will go away by itself, while in fact, the pain stayed. We are too eager to become adult, but when we truly become one, we start to miss our naive days as a spoiled child.\\n\\n\r\nI particularly like one of the headers the publisher used for the manga series:\\n\r\n\"A beautiful story of the strong, yet fragile, Gems.\"\u3000\u300c\u5b9d\u77f3\u305f\u3061\u306e\u5f37\u304f\u3066\u3082\u308d\u304f\u3066\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u7269\u8a9e\u3002\u300d\\n\\n\r\nI find the CGI anime very fluid, compare to what I have seen previously in other anime (you know them), Land of the Lustrous (Houseki no Kuni) doesn't have that awkwardness that often, and the background are animated very lively. 'Such a lovely island' is what I first thought when seeing the bird view shot. The complex camera movement makes the fight scene looks luxurious and breathtaking as if you are one of the arrows approaching the Gems, or the sword in the Gems hand.\\n\\n\r\nTo be true, the music is the thing that kept me watching the series. I have like the music composer since his \"Eccentric Family\" days. Although I didn't know it was the same composer when I watch the first episode, but the music was so intense and bring the essence of the scene out, I felt like I must check out who is it, and came across a familiar name, which I am happy to see him in this project, because he did it well in \"Eccentric Family\". I love the tune in episode preview the most, and I believe it is also the main theme music of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI have seen a lot of people say they hope the character or animation stayed the same as in their previous PV, but I personally like the 3D design better.\\n\r\nThe CV did their job nicely, well, excellent job. Whether it is Phos's yelling, complaining, Diamond's caring and gentle voice, or Bort's harsh and fierce tone. I find them nicely blend together.\\n\\n\r\nThe most enjoyment I had for this season was from Land of the Lustrous. Some say the character development is a bit too slow, personally, I think the events are necessary for the character. Therefore the story should not go quicker than this. Drop the series simply because they spent time planting the hints here and there in the first two episode (what we call world building), is gonna make you lose the upcoming candies.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a hidden gem of the season! Definitely, recommend a watch, be patient with our main protagonist, Phosphophyllite. He/she, well they're all genderless. The story truly has a meaning, try at least 3 episode, you will then start to understand the theme.",

            "content": "So Houseki no Kuni. Wow.\r\nI managed to miss this one last season and just caught up with it over this weekend; I had nothing better to do last night, so I thought I\u2019d investigate the first episode of the weird CGI mineralgirl show.\r\n\u2026and then marathon-ed the whole thing from start to finish. Literally sat there without getting up for anything like it was a five hour movie. It\u2019s brilliant; I had no idea there was something out there that could so easily topple Made in Abyss from my AOTY spot for 2017, but there it was (and I really liked Made in Abyss). \r\nIf you\u2019renot already aware, the very basic premise is that a small society of immortal, androgynous mineral-people are fighting a thousands of year long war against creepy, shiny buddhist ghosts called \u2018Lunarians\u2019 who want to kidnap the mineral people and take them away to the moon. \u2026even if it wasn\u2019t also brilliant, it has originality going for it in spades! Should you have the ability and time, I strongly recommend you at least give the first episode of this a try, so here are some (spoiler free!) reasons to do so;\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the hybrid 2D/CGI animation is gorgeous in a way that I\u2019ve never seen anywhere else. Anyone who avoided this one because of a prejudice against CG animation, please give this one a chance! I think the slightly surreal and artificial setting helps, but the way the show takes advantage of the underused strengths of CGI and the seamless blending with traditional 2D is stunning. I\u2019ve always been a big advocate of the Polygon CGI shows and movies, but the natural movement and expressiveness of the models in HnK make the characters in Sidonia and the new Godzilla look like awkward plastic mannequins in comparison. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019d be easy to point to the fantastic gem effects as the biggest strength of the CG stuff, but to be honest it ended up being the \u2018camerawork\u2019 that really impressed me there. There\u2019s a scene in particular in Episode 10 where a character is running and hiding from a pursuer, that\u2019s done in a single long, unbroken take following them around the room; it massively ratchets up the tension in the scene, and it\u2019s something that just wouldn\u2019t have been practical to do in 2D with the time and budget constraints of a TV anime. There are also several action scenes that reminded me a lot of the best 3D manoeuvre gear fights in the recent run of Attack on Titan, but the CG elements that make that kind of movement possible are much more fluidly incorporated here in HnK.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t CG for the sake of saving money or cutting corners. This is properly harnessing the \u2018new\u2019 tech to do things you couldn\u2019t achieve with the traditional methods. \\n\\n\r\nSecond is the writing. I\u2019m generally not a huge fan of single-cour shows; the vast majority of them feel to me like two-cour scripts that have been viciously hacked down to 12 or 13 episodes. The pacing is often odd, character development gets weirdly accelerated or suddenly cut off, endings come out of nowhere or are disappointingly anticlimactic. It\u2019s only very occasionally that something like Death Parade comes along, where a single cour manages to feel like a complete and satisfying experience. Houseki no Kuni is definitely getting added to that short list.\\n\\n\r\nThere are characters in this show that get introduced and have complete arcs across 20 minutes of screen time that I cared more about than protagonists from shows that ran to 50+ episodes across multiple seasons. The simple but memorable and conveniently colour-coded character designs do a lot to make every one of the fairly large cast distinctive, but the writing and direction is a masterclass in characterisation using small moments and minimal dialogue. Unusually again for a mostly CGI show, there\u2019s always a lot going on in the background in HnK, and even the most minor characters all get to display plenty of personality in their expressions and reactions to events, rather than just standing around like inactive NPCs in a video game. \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Phosphophyllite (Phos, for short) in HnK is a joy to watch. Superficially, they come off as a stereotypical \u2018cheerful well-meaning klutz\u2019, but there\u2019s a subtle introspective depth to them right from the first episode that sets them apart from your run-of-the-mill MC. They start out the show as the youngest and weakest of the group, but the fact that this is a group of powerful, ageless immortals where you could be the useless youngest and weakest individual *literally forever* gives the standard underdog story an edge of hopelessness that really made me feel for poor Phos right out the gate.\\n\r\n\u2028Phos\u2019s character development over the course of the series\u2026 Well, I\u2019m not going to spoil anything at all on that, but it was definitely the most compelling character arc I\u2019ve seen in any anime for a long while. Again, HnK managed to do more with Phos in 12 episodes than I would have thought possible in that limited runtime.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all that, it has some great comedic moments through all twelve episodes. The personality clashes between the various characters often play out in a way that\u2019s totally hilarious, and every joke also ends up giving you more of an insight into them at the same time. The integration of comedy with more dramatic scenes is also done almost perfectly, something which a lot of shows that try to blend the two can stumble on (I\u2019m looking at you, Mahoutsukai no Yome). The comedy always feels natural, and never ends up undermining the drama like I\u2019ve often seen elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nThird is the art direction and music; Houseki no Kuni is gorgeous, and not just \u2018for a CG show\u2019. For me, it\u2019s right up there with Made in Abyss for the best looking and sounding show of the year. The island setting is beautiful, but at the same time bleak, cold and vaguely ominous, and the silent, shining, smirking \u2018buddhist angels\u2019 that make up the Lunarian antagonists of the story are unconventionally terrifying. \\n\\n\r\nThe muted colours of the backgrounds are contrasted by the brightly coloured crystalline hair of the gem-people, the style and exact shade of which was chosen well enough that I don\u2019t think I over had problems telling apart the otherwise identically-dressed characters. \\n\\n\r\nThese character designs remind me a lot of one of the best things about Kemono Friends; in that show, each character\u2019s personality was really cleverly crafted to match the nature of the animal represented in the design, and here they do a similar thing with the real-life gemstones the characters are made of. The gem is reflected the character design, the character design is reflected in the personality of that character, and it gives the whole thing a sense of consistency and verisimilitude.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also fantastic, switching between upbeat \u2018adventure-ey\u2019 orchestral stuff for the more relaxed antics of the main cast, chilling ritualistic percussion for the terrifying Lunarians, and some really beautiful pieces on the Chinese Erhu and piano in some of the melancholy moments. Unfortunately not on Spotify (yet!) but I\u2019m definitely going to see if I can get a hold of this one to listen to independently of the show; it\u2019s that good.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026I should probably stop typing now before this gets any further out of hand than it already has. So sue me, I really enjoyed this and I want to spread that around as much as possible!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Houseki no Kuni is great. Put aside any preconceptions you have about CG animated shows and go watch it.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW WILL BE SPOILER FREE\r\nOutstanding anime, this is my absolute favorite of this year along with Made in Abyss.\r\nStory : \r\nThe premise of the story makes it sound like something you wouldn't expect at all after you're done watching this. It's really misleading, making people think this would be another \"cute\" anime centered around girly characters. Oh it's everything I just described and so much more. \r\nIt starts slowly, developing the main character takes a good chunk of episodes and initially I felt unsure as to  why were we supposed to get attached to her. You understand why very soon. \r\nThroughout the storyit did a job of explaining the nature of this setting and how it comes to be, though be wary of cliffhangers, they're an absolute killer. It does a good job of making the world immersive raising questions after an episode. Even after this first season, one of the entities remains a mystery to the viewers that aren't familiar to the manga, and in a very good way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt :\\n\\n\r\nWow! It's CGI, expect way better than we've seen before. I loved every minute of it, and there are some outstanding shots in the anime that do the manga a lot of justice. The cinematography is outstanding, especially in one particular episode (you'll know which soon), they've outdone themselves and whoever tried CGI before. Good job to studio Orange.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\\n\r\nAhhh, loved the OP. It's very calming, a soothing voice. The ED is just as good, do listen to the full version of those on Youtube, really nice.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very good, especially the main character and the best girl of the show, loved them. Battle sounds, overall scenery and the music is done really well and it blends in with the scenes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : \\n\\n\r\nIt has a very nice cast of different characters, each with their own virtues, humor and troubles. Not all of them are well developed in this first season, time constraints in mind, but those that do get a lot of screen time are very enjoyable, and funny. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\\n\r\nThis was a great experience, and I intentionally left the character section somewhat empty as I would love for you to go in without any spoilers in this show, it's outstanding. I loved every moment of it and will be jealous of you for having the pleasure of watching it for the first time. \\n\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "[SPOILER WARNING]\r\nHouseki no Kuni is a show where the most boring, flat cast of characters do absolutely nothing for 12 episodes amidst one of the most barren, uninteresting environments I've ever had the displeasure to see.  Ill attempt to break down why this show assumes the audience is brain dead and is generally an offensive watch.  \r\nFirst: what this show does right!\r\nAnimation:  HnK won best CGI in the crunchy roll anime awards, and id agree with that sentiment.  Some of the shot composition is really well done, and the movement is very fluid.  The CGI is well done and nevercomes off as jarring.  I was really excited when i saw Phos laying in the grass as it was truly gorgeous to look at.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:  This anime got an amazing OST it frankly doesnt deserve under any circumstance.  What an absolute waste of brilliant music.  Most of the sound design works well too.  HnK is a joy to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nNow the rest:\\n\r\nCharacter:  The cast of HnK is absolutely forgettable, with the exception of Phos who is so poorly written, it makes me want to gag.  On that note, Ill break down Phos.  \\n\r\nPhos is presented as a character living in a utilitarian society with no utilitarian value.  I found this to be a very interesting and intriguing way to introduce a character arc, especially within the confines of the physical aspects of various crystalline structure.  The first few episodes seem to want to embrace this character arc, as some quick research shows there is some structural merit to Phosphophilyte itself that other crystals dont share.  However, this seems to be too complicated for the author to actually realize, and so HnK decides instead to continually break down Phos's body in favor of other tired and boring gimmicks shared by the rest of the cast.  So we first see Phos broken down via dissolution, which magically gives her the ability to converse with the sea creatures (whose name i cant be bothered to remember), though this is later revealed to be simply the sea creatures selectively conversing with Phos in order to take advantage of her.  Nothing comes of this.  Second, Phos is given legs of a different gem stone which gives her super speed.  Nothing comes of this.  The author clearly cant decide on a consistent way to develop Phos's character and attempts to force Phos into a tragic scenario where they must watch another character \"die\" in front of her eyes.  This scene has no weight as death in this show has by this point been established to have no weight.  Thus Phos comes away from her tragedy with gold and platinum arms that do the exact same thing Cinnabar's body does.  So by the end of the show, Phos's character has been stripped of any chance to shine as inherently unique and replaced by the same stock gimmicks given to the rest of the cast.  Phos only has value when she casts aside her identity.  This is a clear sign the author has no fucking clue how to write a convincing character arc, and this is reflected in the rest of the characters.\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast:  They almost entirely exist in the background making the occasional snarky or edgy comment which constantly falls flat.  Kongo sleeps, and occasionally shows up to be a bad ass, Barts is a diamond thats somehow better than the other diamonds even though black diamond is supposed to be crude (props for working that aspect into her character, making Barts ever so slightly less dull than the rest of the cast).  Diamond tries to be affectionate but gets through to no one.  Everyone else falls into obscurity as quickly as their introduced.  Cinnabar is sad because she is poisonous and no one wants her, but no one does anything about it.  Every one is a one trick pony with no impact and no agency.  \\n\\n\r\nNarrative/ Plot\\n\r\nIts fine for a show to have a boring, flat cast of characters if there is a narrative that holds up the show, but HnK's narrative is non existent.  A bland cast of characters fights a boring monster of the week that goes no where.  How dull.  The biggest sin this show commits is that the writers realize the show is complete garbage and attempt to shift the tone by forcing a tragedy out of no where, but as previously said, this falls completely flat, has no foresight, comes out of nowhere, and just comes off as a lazy attempt to make the show edgy.  HnK is certain the audience is brain dead enough to accept what happens though, but the \"death\" of Antarcticite is frankly offensive as a plot device with Phos being inexplicably trapped in a prison, unable to do anything but watch.  Anyone paying attention knows that no one is actually dying though since gems can always be resurrected at the plots convenience, which was previously established early on.  The plot then attempts to pit Phos against Kongo but goes exactly no where with it.  On a final note is the arc, or rather lack there of, for Cinnabar who is exactly where she started by the final episode.  \\n\\n\r\nIll reiterate:  Houseki no Kuni is a complete train wreck which assumes its audience is brain dead in an attempt to sell pretty visuals and aesthetic as a passable show, and its absolute transparency is frankly offensive to sit through.  I wanted to drop this show at episode 3, 4, 6, 8,9,10 but stayed based on the assurances of others opinions that the show would come through at the end, only finishing the show past episode 10 due to being so close to completion.  \\n\\n\r\nDO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND JUST LISTEN TO THE SOUNDTRACK THIS SHOW DIDN'T DESERVE AND THINK OF YOUR OWN STORY TO ACCOMPANY THE MUSIC.  YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY COME UP WITH ANYTHING WORSE THAN HOUSEKI NO KUNI.",

            "content": "Gems are regarded as precious things. There are a plethora of these beautiful, varied jewels, each with distinct colors to catch the eye. Out of this shimmering rouges-gallery, the most popular one may be the diamond. \r\nDiamonds are overvalued. They may shine bright but aren't as uncommon as some like to feel they are. However, they are special for some reason or another, above most other gems. Houseki no Kuni, or Land of the Lustrous, really is a diamond in such a sense, fittingly enough. Not the hardest gem or material ever conceived, and more like the character of Diamond in the show, where despiteits hardness, some cracks can certainly show. However, there is a certain charm, a certain beauty to this series, and in fact, a certain catharsis that comes to myriad individuals who have often doubted CGI shows and the inclusion CGI in anime in general, as well as to the people who saw that it could be done right, without a hitch. That last part may not be entire true; a diamond is not without fault. This show is a Diamond, after all, which feels odd given its initial reception. \\n\\n\r\nIn the early days of Fall 2017, this shimmering beauty was not watched by too many, and its reception was lukewarm at best. I distinctly remember a score of 6.98, a score that most in the community would mock given how it seems like anything under a 7.15 is considered to be a waste at best by the community at large, with exceptions to those who see something others clearly don\u2019t and are oft not outspoken. You could say that throughout the the better part of its run, this show really was a \u201chidden gem\u201d, slowly getting better and better, ever more popular, and better-received by the day. Obviously this isn't the case anymore thanks to all the passionate fans that spread the news of this lustrous jewel throughout the 12 or so weeks of its run. Now, it is more akin to a \u201cdark horse\u201d, ironically enjoyed given the vocabulary thus far. Would I claim this is the best of the year? Certainly no. There are a handful of choices that stand out and shimmer even more beautifully, however that is a small handful of gems, not all of which truly got to shine in front of everyone underneath all the rough this year had provided.\\n\\n\r\nGems are oft valuable, tremendously so. Their value is virtually everlasting. Meanwhile, more than half to more than three quarters of a year\u2019s anime offerings are left in the dust within half a year, either deprived of their insignificant value by time, or with none to begin with. Whist Houseki no Kuni\u2019s value is certainly not everlasting, it is one of the few from 2017 that will be fondly remembered for at least a couple years to possibly even a decade, as many gems should. Yet despite how marvelous this jewel turned out, its luster didn't entirely shine initially. It cracked, and it wasn't as beautiful. However, as stated earlier, much like its protagonist, Phosphophyllite, its pieces were picked up, and it hardened, turning from a blight few cared of, into a far more respected work of craftsmanship. It became even more beautiful, intriguing, and varied as well, much like said character. This applies to the visuals and the narrative at large, even if not all the prices were really put back together.\\n\\n\r\nSaid character, Phosphophyllite, reminds me of an exaggerated version of myself. Lazy upon most tasks found to be terribly uninteresting at best and mind-shatteringly stressful at worst, more than willing to get out of said tasks to the chagrin of the one who assigned them, mocked and challenged by many colleagues, frail, quick to aggravate, understood well by a particularly feminine individual considered to be keen on fictionally romantic situations, and sought after by a specific few for a specific quality. My persona reflects this to a large degree given my wording, though my ordinary self embodies much of this as well, with some applying to one part of me than the other. Indeed, this kind of protagonist embodied some aspects I disdain of my two selves, so warming up to it had to happen, which was thankfully effortless to accomplish the more I related on the whole. Not to knock many of the other, mostly less interesting characters with fantastic chemistry with this one to the point of leading to myriad moments of sheer hilarity. However, it is rather apparent that Phos is the true standout of this show, above all else, with the visuals, and the slimy creature, Ventricosus, who managed to perfectly fill most of Phos\u2019 roles in episode 3 to the point of convincing many, including myself that she actually was Phos. The admittedly decent, yet immense and relatively unexplored cast was ultimately saved from mere relative decency by Phos almost exclusively thanks to the charm Phos has and the chemistry it and the other gems have, which is unfortunate, though other anime that concluded this season with an unexplored cast and a main character that grows a ton and learns about the world, have fared far worse in this regard. The fact that Phos develops in ways that affect it detrimentally as a living being as more of the Phosphophyllite we once knew is stripped away, including any sense of satisfaction of accomplishing anything anymore, is also engaging, even if sometimes it feels like we only really see the results of the development, feeling as if we skipped an episode dedicated entirely to said character growing weary and possibly depressed after the new powers acquired after a situation that sparked this gigantic change in Phos\u2019 life.\\n\\n\r\nAnother monumental aspect of this series\u2019 charm and acclaim, as well as the largest point of the overvalue is the visual department. The CGI character designs are certainly fantastic, especially in terms of the shimmering and detailed hair that dictates which gem each individual is. The hair sometimes goes above and beyond, such as with Diamond\u2019s hair that constantly shines multiple colors and creates a heavenly light in the dark. I do find it odd that the series focuses more attention on their attention-grabbing derriere than even Code Geass and Sword Art Online, especially when all of them, despite most of them being abjectly feminine in nearly way, are considered genderless. Even worse, the models have absolutely sluggish frame rates, and when they move in tandem to the well-done environment, the difference in frames feels awkward to put it politely. However, the choreography in the fight scenes is rather impressive, and combined with the dynamic camera movement a CGI series allows, as well as the stellar designs and interesting effects of the anthropomorphised gems and materials, it isn\u2019t a surprise that this show is heralded as a fantastic action show, let alone a fantastic CGI action show. Special praise must also be given to the visuals of the ending theme for its magnificent 2D visuals that are unlike anything I have seen, to the point where I cannot accurately describe what kind of two-dimensional visuals they are, other than magnificently colorful and charming. I can certainly say as well that the issues the first episode presented, visually speaking, got relatively ironed out over time minus the frame rates in the models, like when we reserve 2D for that fantastic ending credits sequence or for impact-related dust clouds and whatnot. Not to sing this series\u2019 praises in terms of visuals as much as others have, but when we see improvements being made to an already visually unique series, especially one done almost entirely by three-dimensional computer animated models, it is certainly cathartic, notably as of 2017, to agree with the visuals looking splendid on the whole. Combining everything with some interesting and trippy moments of introspection with great directing by Takahiko Kyogoku, the team at Studio Orange did a really interesting and relatively fantastic job here.\\n\\n\r\nAnd whist the narrative is rather inviting and willing to slowly reveal more over time, including themes about what humanity was like in the distant past, about life, and how immortals still have plenty to fear much like mortals do, among other things, there are some fundamental issues. For one, for a 2.5/10 hardness rating, Phos is so fragile and weak at times that I could almost swear she was 1.5; even a 2.5 wouldn't break just for stepping on a rock. It also raises consistency issues with how fragile or study Phos is, especially when another gem with a slightly higher rating can take so much more and is infinitely stronger. Also, you have to learn via commercial break and return eyecatchers that the hardness rating is out of 10 unless you already have such knowledge; while it turns out that ultimately, the Mohs scale makes it so that even a .5 difference is monumental, most viewers would be uneducated on the subject and this would need to be told by the series in order to really buy this, which they aren't. Given how memory is stored in the actual gems within every fiber of their being sans their hair to the point of every single shard comprising of memories, how do they consistently gain new memories, and given the seemingly finite amount of space, and their immortality, how can they continually gain new memories for all of eternity? They don't seem to physically grow. When Phos loses her legs, she manages to retain nearly everything important and only really lose memories of one individual and a location she had seen for the first time? Up until the halfway mark, the gems seemed to have photographic memory, and even afterward they mostly do, so it seems like Phos and other can't remember some things for the sake of convenience or emotion, as contradictory as it seems to what impressive memory they seem to display. Given that there are two amethysts that are numbers 33 and 84 respectively, how many of each exact gem are there? The yellow gem has lived for thousands of years, over 3,500 in particular, so you are left to ponder of the age of the likes of Bort and Sensei, who are much wiser and more battle ready? Has sense lived for tens of thousands of years? How long has this conflict gone on? Are none of them tired of life barring CInnabar, who is only sick of everything due to how no one respects it or can find a use for it given its hazardous condition? How exactly does this gooey material all gems have inside them really connect the missing pieces together, and how come we never see any of it splash out when a gem gets slashed or downright shattered into a cornucopia of shards and pieces?\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on, but the point has long since been made clear as crystal; that being: all of this serves a grander dilemma in that we do not know well enough how this species of gems work, as an inhuman amount of aspects about them are contradictory and unfathomable to try to answer. Not to mention other issues like how only one of them has any semblance of knowing how to use a projectile, and none of them have ever tried that or coming up with experiments to allow long-range combat on their end to possibly surpass the projectile-heavy weaponry of the Lunarans. There aren't too many problems with the active narrative in terms of holes, errors, and progression (at least in the first half), barring a few conveniences and contradictions mentioned earlier and not mentioned at all, as well as a few real issues towards the end, but when it invites you to learn as much as it does, and you try to think of everything, or beyond the most obscenely basic understanding of how the gems work, you end up with myriad questions the series cannot tackle about the world-building or the novel species it is depicting. It would be like a high school biology teacher trying to explore how humans work in an attempt to invite others into such knowledge, yet she only understand a minute aspect of their biology and psychology, infinitely less than the still limited knowledge we already have acquired within the best two centuries about our species, leaving you disappointed as you already know more about the subject than she does by the time you\u2019ve taken the midterm, and there are no more classes on the subject at your school. One could counter back with \u201cthe series doesn\u2019t need to know everything, it even admits that it doesn\u2019t\u201d, however most stories  that explore a fictional species do so enough for you to get the gist of things without delving deep enough and doing things that make you question everything about said species. This clearly wasn\u2019t one of them, and it suffered for that. The fact that they sorta dodge showing us some of the processes involving healing other gems only makes this burn even harder, and the ending is certainly nothing satisfying, amounting to a \u201cwe made it this far and covered ground; wait for more or read the source material\u201d. And you wonder why I'm such a curmudgeon.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and also, while the show does present a few interesting themes to explore, including how these characters deal with immortality, don't be surprised when they start leaving those in the back-burner at best or drop them like flies at worst. It is another glaring flaw in this show preventing it from being one of the crown jewels of the year.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other positives I want to throw out there to really sell that despite the major problems the show has, it is still a laudable show, particularly involving the character arcs Phos and Diamond go through, but I cannot really mention much without spoiling them other than the premises of said arcs. I already mentioned Phos\u2019 so Diamond\u2019s is about learning to get stronger and do things on its own, which while executed almost how you would expect, there is a brutal twist to it near the end of episode 10, to leave it at that for you to speculate. I cannot really do the narrative any more justice in a spoiler-free review, so let me just say that the humor is gut-busting to me and that the show does throw in a few wild surprises in there, some of which nearly had me rolling on the floor in terms of comedy. So now, let me transition into what I feel truly shines as the best aspect of the show: the music. \\n\\n\r\nThe enchantingly melodic tunes of the pieces such as \u201cLunarians\u201d and immensely memorable and emotion-intensive pieces such as \u201cDanger\u201d and especially \u201cCinnabar\" and \"Breaking\u201d make particularly the action scenes and emotional scenes leave even more of an impact than otherwise. Even if some tracks get played too frequently, they simply sweep you into every scene in a way that really invites you in and immersed you. The OP, \"Kyoumen no Nami (\u93e1\u9762\u306e\u6ce2)\" by YURiKA, is among the best this season has to offer, exemplifying a lot of what I mentioned previously about the OST, and the vocals make my love for the song reach ever more. The ED, \"Kirameku Hamabe (\u714c\u3081\u304f\u6d5c\u8fba)\" by Yuiko Ohara, is also fantastic, and is also one of the more emotionally resonant pieces of music in the series, especially combined with its stellar visuals. All in all, the music is simply fantastic, sweeping, and emotional, and I had no idea what to expect from it overall, nearly getting floored with some of these pieces the first time. Unfortunately, only a handful of tracks really get to stand out this way, but it's still more than many have managed to do.\\n\\n\r\nSo, this was Houseki no Kuni. A gem that shines bright enough to become a dark horse of its season and captivate the hearts of many for weeks, as well as set a new benchmark for full CGI anime in the future to strive to live up to. I had a good time viewing and appraising this jewel, even if it isn't as lustrous as its title suggests. So, as always, with all that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "Note: I have not read the source material (manga), so this review will be based on the anime alone.\r\nThe only word I could use to describe the world of Houseki no Kuni (Land of the Lustrous) is \u201cbizarre\u201d. It certainly takes an amazing amount of imagination and a dose of craziness to come up with an unique world like this, but I can\u2019t help but feel that this is also exposed as the anime\u2019s weakest point. It took a lot of time and effort to explain even the basics of how the world works, and even then the world feels difficult to understand. This isnot helped by the fact that unlike sci-fi or fantasy worlds based somewhat on reality, the viewer can\u2019t populate the background of Houseki no Kuni with activity. It's just a barren world that is hard to believe in.\\n\\n\r\nThis overly simplified world is contrasted with a huge ensemble of mostly forgettable characters, often appearing for only a few seconds at a time. This is not helped by the fact that they have long and convoluted mineral/gem names, making them even less memorable. When a character is promoted to the center of the story, they feel as if they serve no further purpose than to forward the plot, and (with the exception of one) become irrelevant within two episodes. The main character Phos is the only one with any semblance of development, but while its shift from from beginning to end is striking, barely anyone else mattered.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is obviously incomplete. While there is a nice connection to the beginning, ultimately it shows you the door to its manga continuation more than anything remotely satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a unique story for sure, but as a whole I don't feel like it's gone anywhere in these 12 episodes, and an overall disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Houseki no Kuni is marked by its generous use of 3D animation, which is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it presents the textures and reflections of the gems very well, and makes for some VERY dynamic fight scenes, but on the other hand, facial expressions and tiny movements (such as head tilting) feels rigid and unnatural. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, this is still probably one of the best and most extensive use of 3D animation I\u2019ve seen so far, and it would be hard to imagine some of the scenes (especially towards the end) without it. But I wouldn't rate it as an unmitigated success -- whether or not it's good is still pretty much up to personal tastes.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are nice, memorable tunes that aren't too generic, but it's the OST and insert songs that shine here. There's an varied selection of styles, and many of the tracks fit the mood of the scene nicely.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Houseki no Kuni is a puzzling anime for me: Puzzling world, puzzling story, puzzling characters, and a lot of it remains unresolved till the end. I would suppose the Manga would provide a lot of answers to my questions, but as a non-manga reader, it's hard to give it a more satisfactory score until the second season is out.",

            "content": "Houseki no Kuni is a story set on an island in a post-apocalyptic world, where a collection of immortal gemstone-based people cluster around the mysterious Adamant-sensei, who keeps them occupied with jobs tailored to their interests and abilities - all except Phosphophyllite, a spoiled child who is too delicate to do the job he REALLY wants to do; fighting the celestial spirit-like Lunarians that are constantly trying to shatter the gems and use them as jewelry. Tasked with creating an encyclopedia to distract him, Phos meets the secluded Cinnabar for the first time, and begins to question what it means to have value.\r\nThe story, despiteits character-driven slice-of-life angle, is primarily written as a mystery. Each arc (the first one concluding in episode 5) is concluded with a drastic change in Phos, and that change is used to give Phos a new perspective on the world he lives in and the secrets Adamant-sensei is keeping.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the first episode is a wobbly start, and the story doesn't do a good job of communicating that it's a worldbuilding mystery of the same class as Kemono Friends or Girl's Last Tour; in those shows, the mystery as at the forefront, constantly reminding you of the question through key references and the protagonist's own interest, but in Houseki no Kuni, Phos blithely goes on his merry way uncaring of the seemingly perfect world around him, buying into the status quo completely. Unless you're asking the questions it wants you to ask (or you've read the more ethereal and painfully lonely original manga), Houseki no Kuni comes off as tonally unstable, despite its straightforward setup.\\n\\n\r\nDespite how badly it's communicated, the story itself is wonderful, and the slow unrolling of the lore with each consecutive episode and conflict is constantly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe CG is designed to emulate mid-quality 2D animation, low frame-rate included, so it's a matter of taste whether you enjoy it or not. The cinematography and post-processing is gorgeous, with fantastic uses of colour and wild, chaotic action scenes, but I wish it better communicated the quiet emptiness of the island and the seas around it; I've seen a few people consider the lack of details 'lazy', but it's more like it's not featureless ENOUGH to get the idea across. The underwater segments probably do a better job of this.  \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, almost none of the beautiful, striking cinematography and sakuga is in episode 1 (barring MAYBE the very lovely scene of a broken Phos), and the Adamant-sensei 3D model is...not very pleasant close-up, but otherwise, the characters are all attractive, with gorgeous and expressive facial animation. Absolutely pinpoint perfect sound design combined with character animation communicates that these are extremely heavy gemstones, as light and human-like as they look when they're not in motion, and the way the lighting accentuates their gem traits is stunning. Overall the best-looking show this season, if only just based on personal taste.",

            "content": "This is my first review, and English isn't my primary language, so excuse some of the grammar mistakes.\r\nTo be honest, I feel like this anime's a bit underappreciated. While some of the things presented in this anime might not be suited for everyone's taste(such as the concept behind the gems and the 3DCG animation, which I'll discuss later on their respective parts), this anime has adapted the manga quite well and faithfully. The manga itself was quite good, and I'd recommend reading it after the anime finishes airing as it shows other things that might not be shown on the anime due to the limitedepisodes(unless they decided to adapt a second season).\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe main concept of the story revolves around immortal and genderless gem people fighting against the moon people who tries to take them away for decorations, which is quite the unique take on 'fighting against unknown forces' plot that's normally often used in other series(either anime or manga). However, when you look deeper upon it, the series also has a life and death symbolism embedded on it, making the series more interesting than it seems on the surface if you noticed them. I feel like the description is a bit misleading, as the encyclopedia part actually doesn't do much to the story itself, and the main story itself is best described as a 'coming-of-age' story, as the main character(Phos) develops as they go through various hardships(like a saying: misery builds character) while trying to help another character(Cinnabar/Shinsha). Being a manga adaptation, each episode represents 2-3 chapters of the manga, which is a fine pace for me(though I was initially a bit concerned on how far it'll adapt).\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe characters are nice and expressive, and the scenery is very well made. The animation is also quite fluid as well, especially during the battle scenes. While 3DCG can be quite polarizing for some people, it can look great if done right, as this anime proves. Because of that, I don't think this anime deserves hate solely because it's CG.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOne of the reasons I decided to watch the anime is how they would sound like, and when I saw the lineup of the voice actors, I had expectations, and they delivered. The voices suit them, and the soundtracks are quite nice as well; they fit the events going on the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters have distinctive appearances(with the gem people looking like the gems they're portraying, even having traits corresponding to them), as well as unique personalities to boot. Some of them can be quite prominent on one point but later aren't shown much, however the story revolving around them gives enough impression on how they look and act. Overall, each of them has their own charm which makes them likable, even though some of characters have more/less screentime than the others.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis show manages to be both refreshing and deep at the same time, and in a good way. With the previews, each episode will leave you wondering about what happens next. The show also has a good amount of humor despite not being a comedy, and what makes them great is that they don't seem out of place, which adds more to the enjoyment factor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nLike said above, while the premise might not be for everyone, I still highly recommend checking this anime. The story might seem a bit slow at first, but it eventually picks up.\\n\\n\r\nI'd give this 9.5/10, since it's a great adaptation of a great manga, but MAL doesn't allow decimals here. I hope they'd adapt another season eventually, but I think it won't be revealed so soon, especially since the anime and the manga haven't been finished yet.",

            "content": "BEAUTIFUL. STUNNING. GORGEOUS. LUSTROUS!  This anime, by far, is the most beautifully animated series I have ever seen.  It is a shining example of how 3D Animation is the future of anime.  I have seen a lot of beautifully animated series in my life, but this one, in my humble opinion, out shined them all.  It was easily the biggest draw of the anime.  I can't ever remember a time where I would rewind just to watch a character run.  But, the animation combined with the motion and camera angles made even running, a spectacular sight.  \r\nNaturally, becauseof the high level of animation, the battles were superb to watch.  Especially in later episodes, as the protagonist, Phos, develops.  Additionally, the character design was fantastic as well.  The gems (who to me seem like girls, but are gender neutral) are all given these incredible hairstyles that are almost translucent.  They were as beautiful as real gems to look at, especially Dia.   \\n\\n\r\nI also really enjoyed the unique premise of the anime, which as you know from the synopsis, follows 28 characters who live alone on the Earth fighting off the Lunarians who want them as decorations.  This threat loomed constantly over the girls who were deeply bonded by centuries together.  So, even though they were immortal, you still felt the loss if someone was taken, through the other characters.   There is a mystery to this anime, that I can't wait to see unraveled in a season two.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, that speaks to an issue with this anime that more and more animes are starting to have: Cliffhanger endings to seasons that don't give any kind of feeling of resolution.  It hurts the story when creators look to angle for a second season by not properly wrapping up the first season in any meaningful way.  What if you don't get a second season?  Cliffhangers are irritating by themselves, but when done in lieu of any kind of ending whatsoever, it's deeply damaging to a series.  This same thing is found in Land of the Lustrous.  Either set up two main driving plots and finish one and leave the other for the second season, or just end the first season properly. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the creators got what they were looking for, because I enjoyed this anime so much, and I want to know what happens next, that I will definitely be looking out for season 2.  \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters are concerned, I liked them all, with the exception of Bort.  The supporting cast was filled with likable characters like Dia, Rutile, Alex and Kongou.  But, Phos is easily my favorite character of the season, and the way this anime handled her maturation as a character was well done.  You watch as event after event changes her in serious ways both physically and mentally.  While physical changes in anime are regular, you rarely see mental changes in MCs that totally redefine the character. Most MC's finish with the exact same personalities that they started with, no matter what traumatic events or swerves they suffer.  Not so with Phos. The changes to her mental psyche are a big part of the anime and an example of proper character development.  \\n\\n\r\nOutside of yet another cliffhanger non-ending, Land of the Lustrous was a fantastic anime, the beauty of which I can't stress enough.  Definitely check it out. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: Over 9,000!!!\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9 (Non-ending hurt it).  \\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cConstantly, I think to myself that I would like to be reborn\u2026\u201d \r\n-Phosphophyllite\r\nDo you ever wish you could change and transcend the limitations of the body you were given? Phos' journey in Land of the Lustrous (Houseki no Kuni) is a compelling exploration of a person who desires to change themselves, both physically and mentally. Studio Orange's adaptation of Haruko Ichikawa's manga is unlike any anime you've ever seen. Stunning CGI, visceral yet graceful nature to which it portrays bodies, and a dense analysis of the human condition make it unforgettable.\r\nIn the distant future, Earth has been ravaged by six meteors. The meteors broke offparts of the planet and formed six moons. Earth has been reduced to one single shore and the rest of the planet is the ocean. This single shore is, while beautiful, has entirely infertile land. Only one organism populates the land because they don't eat food from the planet, they photosynthesize. Evolved from the organisms that live in the depths of the ocean, they became beautiful gems who reflect sunlight with every move they make. \\n\r\nCreatures that live on one of the moons known as Lunarians travel down to Earth to capture the gems for their own personal desires. The prettier gems being the most desirable. As long as the moon hangs above the characters' heads there is a constant feeling of fear for their lives, in turn creating constant tension for us as viewers as we can never be sure if a character may be swept away or shattered into pieces (and no amount of perceived plot armor will stop them). We constantly see a full moon in the background of the show with gems framed below its vastness as if it is preparing to encroach upon their temporary safety.\\n\\n\r\nLand of the Lustrous tells the story of the youngest of the 28 gems, but they\u2019re all immortal so being younger than a thousand-year-old being is still quite old. Our main character Phosphophyllite brought to life by Tomoyo Kurosawa\u2019s exquisite performance that is able to get to capture such a wide range of emotion and tone, is inherently relatable thanks to a lack of seriousness and plenty of recognizable mannerisms. \\n\\n\r\nPhos ranks near the bottom of the \u201cMohs Scale\u201d used in real life as well, which dictates how high or low a gemstone\u2019s hardness is on a scale of 1-10. In the society they live in, if you\u2019re born with a low hardness then you have no choice but to take on a role suitable to you, but if you have a high hardness you\u2019re expected to protect the others in combat. And because they\u2019re immortal, roles are permanent. Unchanging. It\u2019s a roulette that\u2019s spun for the gems, spun for us all. It doesn\u2019t matter what body you get because you\u2019ll be stuck with it. It\u2019s up to you to decide what to make of the body you\u2019re given. However, Phos is so useless in their society that they fill no niche or role. Thanks to their upbeat and irreverent personality they\u2019re able to live optimistically, if pointlessly. It's a stark image of the unmotivated youth, struggling to find direction or even motivation. An image that I resonated with immediately. And more than likely you will too or, at the very least, you'll appreciate the direction Phos takes to better themself and help their fellow gem suffering from a similar struggle, Cinnabar.\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning of the show Phos is descending into pointlessness (almost like an actual rock), berated by the other gems for a lack of talent. They say things like \u201cAre you good for anything?\u201d and \u201cYou don\u2019t do anything at all\u201d. It\u2019s all played off for laughs, if a bit mean-spirited, but the truth is, Phos only has a 3.5 which is so low that they\u2019re not even allowed to fight. Phos would fall to pieces if they were shot by just one of the arrows the Lunarians use. Phos comes to hate the limitations of their body, regardless of how desirable the Lunarians find their peppermint green color. And there are other gems who envy Phos for their desirable color, of course without Phos fully understanding that they have qualities worth being jealous of. This is just one of the many ways the show incites introspection, saying that we all have some notable qualities no matter who we are. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Phos doesn\u2019t technically break themselves, throughout the show they throw themselves into danger with the desire to be broken, hidden beneath their silly personality. Through being broken with intense physicality and repeatedly being put back together with a light but audibly satisfying sheen, Phos grows to become a new person from who they originally were. After all, if the gems lose a piece once broken, they lose an equally sized chunk of their memory. So occasionally after a battle, one of them may forget the name of the other, but in the more drastic cases later on in the show there are harsher consequences. In one of the most chilling moments of the show, Phos is beckoned to danger by an unseen force (assumably their desire) that says \u201cYou must change.\u201d It\u2019s that horrifying feeling we all have at one point, and Land of the Lustrous delivers fear-inspiring moments like these every now and then, but most of them come in the later episodes. These moments successfully connect the viewer to the central character and their turmoil by giving them vivid fever-dream visualizations. Phos\u2019 journey is the main narrative throughline of the show, and thank god for that because seeing them grow and learn more about their world makes for a rewarding adventure indeed. The main character isn't the only suffering from inner turmoil. Every gem has some sort of anguish that torments them. Even Diamond, with a hardness of 10.0 who Phos idolizes, feels great envy for the slightly tougher Bort. These subtle nuances to each character aren't shoved onto us either. They\u2019re minor details, subtly woven into the script so that the generally upbeat mood doesn't become melancholy, but it's enough for you to pick up on so it will feel rewarding to see their progression in the background of Phos' story. \\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake, this is not only a compelling journey through the main character\u2019s struggle against themself, or even about the three-dimensional supporting cast that serves as foils to Phos. It's about bodies, how they deserve you to live in harmony with it rather than in spite of it.\\n\\n\r\nBodies are treated as sacred totems in Land of the Lustrous. To place them in the purest form possible, gender is removed entirely, each gem referring to the other with they/them pronouns only (as I have thus far). They\u2019re quite literally artifacts that glisten in the sunlight. The gems are constantly framed with vast negative spaces to highlight how valuable their beauty and vibrant color is to the desolate world they grace by inhabiting. Also, the director repeatedly frames the gems in symmetrical shots as if they are the focal point of a work of art, hanging in a fine art museum. Even the more enigmatic supporting characters like Bort and Antarcticite are portrayed with beauty and elegance through their immaculate fighting style that each gem uses. The fighting choreography appears as graceful as a ballet dance but has the visceral impact necessary for them to take on a fleet of eldritch creatures. The action is unlike anything you\u2019ll ever see. And it\u2019s brought to life amazingly with the most stunning CGI I have ever seen in a TV series. The previous works of the director Takahiko Kyogoku includes another CGI oriented show (Love Live! School Idol Project) and it really shows because he\u2019s improved on that show\u2019s animatronic dance numbers in just about every way. Action scenes are where the director shows us his best abilities, and they only get more impressive as the show progresses. The \u201ccamera\u201d work during action scenes is so dynamic. The smooth camera motions coupled with the fluid movements of the characters makes for scenes that devour your attention entirely. Even during the scenes with less motion, the gems are still quite vibrant. Their vividly colored hair and reflectiveness that causes light to bounce off of them makes the show, at the very least, always eye-catching. \\n\\n\r\nThe respect that each gem\u2019s body is treated with makes it all the more distressing when they\u2019re shattered in combat. This, coupled with intense visual and audio feedback, makes the combat to be some of the most thrilling action I've ever witnessed. Even though the gems are immortal, there is still a fear for their lives, if they are broken and become immobile then they will be trapped in their bodies forever. Endlessly. Arguably that is a fate worse than death. Even worse, the Lunarians may repurpose you into a weapon or jewelry (as seen in episode one). \\n\\n\r\nThe orchestral soundtrack backing most scenes maintains the mystifying tone of the show and is fantastic throughout. Music swells during combat and during some scenes, it matches the instruments the Lunarians play when they come down to capture a gem. Sound effects are also incredibly satisfying on the ears; the sheen of a gem being put back together after a tough battle, the airy wisps of the cloudlike Lunarians, the clinking sound that can be heard as gems walk across the marble floor of their home. Lustrous is never harsh on the ears yet it has an intense audible impact. Both the opening and ending credits are quite good. The ending Kirameku Hamabe especially shouldn't be understated. With fear-inspiring images of the moon, the poison metal alloy that flows around Cinnabar, as well as a few references to the later turns the story takes, the ending perfectly encapsulates the darker themes of the show. To contrast this, the song that supports the visuals evokes hope.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond just being an audio-visual wonder, Land of the Lustrous is an analytical masterpiece. The director brought excellent talent to the table, but the source manga by Haruko Ichikawa deserves credit for being rich with symbolism. Thankfully, this carries over into this compact but well-paced adaptation. Not a second of screentime is spared. When we\u2019re not being delighted with the funny and whimsical script, mesmerized by the visuals, or sometimes all at once we\u2019re being delivered the themes through visual imagery.\\n\\n\r\nThe thematic throughline in Lustrous follows the idea of change. The changing of one's self, the change that Phos and their fellow gems desire. As such, concepts like death and rebirth are constantly showcased with symbolism. When are gems are broken, they\u2019re placed in black bags that strangely resemble body bags. It\u2019s as if they\u2019ve died are being remade once the doctor puts them back together. This intrinsic connection the show shares with death also explains why each gem wears a black tuxedo resembling funeral attire. As if they're all in a constant state of mourning for the pieces of their comrades (and selves) that are lost in battle. The show is also doused in Buddhist imagery at nearly every corner. Whether it be the enigmatic \u201cSensei\u201d that all of the gems respect and rules over them like a deity, the ritual-like behaviors and designs of the Lunarians, and the frequent references to rebirth. If you know about the Buddhist philosophy, you\u2019ll know the goal of the religion is to relinquish the body that carries your soul so you can be liberated and proceed on to Nirvana. There\u2019s even a scene in which a certain character is supposedly reborn as a small animal to more suit the karma that they obtained in life. It can\u2019t get any more clear than that. But in action, like everything Lustrous does, the results are absolutely mystifying. Seeing all of these different concepts clash together with great visual quality and artistic direction makes for one of the most bewildering yet beautiful experiences ever.\\n\r\nNo details added to Lustrous were done so without reason, everything is purposeful. Everything is necessary. It may have helped that I was learning about Buddhism in tandem with Lustrous\u2019 tv airing, but knowing of these themes definitely enriched my experience. Keep in mind, there are many interpretations with such an abstract and ambiguous story like this one, so you may find different meanings in the show from the ones I did.\\n\\n\r\nBefore closing, it's worth mentioning that as the source material is still ongoing, this anime does not have a complete ending. Enough plot lines ended on a satisfying (if incomplete) note, and a few new ones were opened to give you a sense of the direction of the next season will take. The story is not over so I will be patiently awaiting the second season, but until then I\u2019ll be happy to dig through the show\u2019s lore and alternate meanings as there is plenty of rewatch value.\\n\\n\r\nLand of the Lustrous is, for the most part, a joyful adventure that may even inspire laughs, but let your guard down too long and the Lunarians will steal away all you hold dear leaving you devastated. At its heart, it is a pure and simple story about how impossibly flawed we are as people. How we'll always search for means to become better, endlessly until we finally reach the end of the cycle. Whether or not this series has all of the answers, you'll want to listen to the tale it has to tell about the questions.",

Phosphophyllite (or Phos in short) is the protagonist and goes through fantastic development over the duration of the series, becoming a very memorable character.\\n\\n\r\nNow it's time for the art department and I will be honest here: if every CGI anime has to look like Houseki, god, I want so many more of them! The animation is amazing and had some scenes where I just had to replay them of how good they looked, and the excellent cinematography that goes with it just makes it even more impressive, with some shots that left me speechless. The use of this type of animation is also really fitting considering the constitution of our characters and for details like how they can break depending on the situation, which looks better with this style.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also a strong factor of the series, always fitting with the tone of the scene and improving them, the theme that plays when the Lunarians appears gets an special mention from my part because it never failed to make me shiver, so unsettling. The opening and ending themes are also great in both song and visuals and grew on me as the series progressed, definitely playlist worthy.\\n\\n\r\nHouseki no Kuni was an unique and fantastic experience I really recommend everyone to try out, you won't regret it.",

            "content": "The GRRM Reaper once posited the Furniture Rule: that at its core, literature is an exploration of the human condition; the rest is fluff, furniture.\r\nHouseki no Kuni begins as a simple story of immortal, genderless life forms, the Gems, with each individual based around a gemstone from which they take their physical characteristics. They are being hunted down by Lunarians for what seems to be collector\u2019s fancy. Slowly, the story moves on, teasing the layers of mystery of its world and a more intriguing aspect of the entire dynamic unravels, one more conducive to philosophical discourse. The introduction of a third faction, the Admirabilis, elevatesthe nature of their conflict and is poised to bring the series higher should its story continue.\\n\\n\r\nThe CGI nature of the show doesn't really take away anything from the narrative but rather enhances and prepares it with its CGI portrayal of the three factions telling a story: the Gems, with their janky yet solid movements, aimless and unmotivated beyond mere survival; the Lunarians ethereal and eternal, purposeful in action; and the Admirabilis, frills and filaments galore, excess made manifest, seductive and ephemeral.\\n\\n\r\nUnderneath the trappings of a fantastical concept, however, Houseki no Kuni is a thesis of how our place in our world is intricately intertwined with our purpose. It's a story about identity. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a story of Dia, valued, vaunted, a tier above other gems, yet struggling to find a moment in the light under the vast, dark shadow of a peer better and stronger.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a story of Cinnabar, self-exiled, isolation poisoning the mind, bereft of a shoulder to lean on.\\n\\n\r\nMost of all, it's a story of Phos, aimless slacker, wanting to do more than just making an encyclopedia that has no equivalent value assigned by other Gems. Phos wants to fight, swept up in the idea that Gems prove their worth in the only way their circumstances allow: fighting the Lunarians. Phos' initial value was demonstrated when, devoured and broken to bits and pieces, the grim, though temporary, fate evoked nothing but cruelly nonchalant reactions from fellow gems. \\n\\n\r\nHow can someone so brittle prove their value when, to paraphrase Einstein, the fishes are judged by their ability to climb a tree.\\n\\n\r\nHouseki no Kuni\u2019s approach to the problem is a rather straightforward one. Instead of changing the playing field to a pond, our little fish is given an opportunity to be better, losing parts of itself in the process. Part of its identity must give, in the hopes that the best version of itself can be achieved. And that hopefully the best version of itself is its truest self. Whether it\u2019s true or not remains to be seen.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I must say, this conflict of identity and the show\u2019s solution ties in fully with the larger, grander aspects of the narrative: the three factions, each crucially lacking traits the other two possess. Can the three factions be so much more together much like how Phos had become much more than the Mohs scale of hardness? We'll see.\\n\\n\r\nFor now, enjoy one lost little fish trying to scale a tree, struggling to find the right balance lest it loses sight of who it is.",

            "content": "Over the last few years or so, it seems that the discussion regarding the use of CGI in anime has grown all the more prominent, and for perfectly good reason too. It appears that more and more shows are using CGI to greater affect, which is generally brought with much disdain with anime fans. For shows that use CGI in accordance with the use of traditional 2-D animation, the end result is usually one that comes across as jarring, as the two modes of animation juxtaposes awkwardly with one another, with scenes that end up feeling clunky or strange. It usually ends up dragging meout of my immersion of the show, since it doesn\u2019t make visual coherent sense, and often the CGI sticks out look a sore thumb, with this season\u2019s Inuyashiki being a prime example of that, constantly intermixing both modes of animation haphazardly into its action sequences. With shows that are fully CGI, this jarring contrast is pretty much eliminated, but many suffer from poor production overall since the CGI is often rather ugly looking, with the two recent adaptations of Berserk being the king of this! Both shows feature some of the most poorly produced CGI action sequences I have ever seen, where most of the time it looks like two puppets awkwardly rubbing up against each other instead of them fighting! And there are many other shows like this too, so it\u2019s no wonder why fans look at CGI with such disdain and actively try and avoid any shows that utilise it, which is perhaps why this season\u2019s Houseki no Kuni, or Land of the Lustrous if you will, was so under looked within the community, which is a shame too, since, to make a frankly overused and terrible pun, Houseki no Kuni is the gem of the season!\\n\\n\r\nMuch to mine, and many other\u2019s surprise, Houseki was a breath of fresh air, not only from typical CGI oriented anime, but for anime in general, with a wonderfully creative setting, lore and personality-filled characters! While Inuyashiki was a disappointment, Houseki is the salvation to said disappointment, with each passing episode, making me fall in love with this show all the more, and why it certainly is not perfect, provides me with a seasonal show I actively looked forward to watching each week, which hasn\u2019t happened since Dragon Maid earlier this year. But, I\u2019ve babbled on for too long now. Let\u2019s actually dive in!\\n\\n\r\nSet in the distant future, Houseki no Kuni tells the story of a group of genderless gems, all of which have differing personalities and characteristics, who, along with their master, a bald monk with insane powers, have to fight off against a race called the Moon Dwellers - a race of strange creatures who descend from said place to capture the gems! The series sees our main protagonist, Phosphophyllite, come of age in this world, slowly becoming more independent and stronger as the series progresses. Houseki has this way of immediately immersing me into its atmosphere and world, not only through its wonderful use of music and beautiful looking scenery, but just from all the little details the show provides too. The fact that each gem has specific characteristics, and are classed in accordance of their strength, the fact that they can be broken into tiny pieces and stuck back together again, that they can lose their memories if certain body parts are missing, that they have to hibernate over winter as they grow weaker and tired, and that they can potentially be combined with other elements for different affects are all things I can appreciate in making the show way more interesting and fascinating to me, and these elements are often used in creative ways for either characterisation or as elements for advancing the narrative. It\u2019s the use of these creative elements that makes Houseki such a wonder to watch, and helps to differentiate it from much of its ilk; its these elements and ideas that I can\u2019t get anywhere else, but they are not simply played as gimmicks either, but as an integral aspect of the setting and narrative. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the show has this overbearing sense of mystery, and almost whimsical sense to it as well. Much like our protagonist, Phos, who knows nothing of this world, so do we as an audience, so we experience the world and learn new things about it as does Phos, which not only helps us grow more attached to this character as well, but the rules and mysteries of this world are dished out to the audience in a consistent pace, keeping the narrative interesting and fresh. Moreover, the show has several mysteries as well, such as what the true nature of the Moon Dwellers actually are or the state of humanity, evident in a scene where Phos is trying to recollect the events that transpired earlier in which she (yes, for the sake of convenience I'm going to be referring to the gems as \"she\"; I apologise for being a CIS white male and assuming gender) can\u2019t remember as she had lost some of her body parts, but mentions the word \u201chuman\u201d which greatly alarms that of the Sensei, the guardian and father figure of the Gems, giving us insight into the seriousness of the memory Phos has, and sliding little hints to the audience about the true nature of the Sensei character himself. The show even dabbles in some philosophical ideas too in the fifth episode, regarding what it means to truly be human and what it truly means for someone to die, as the very concept of death is foreign to the Gems, and while it is not explored to much substantial merit, the show does throw around this idea, making the Gems feel more believable with a greater sense of purpose. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s even a genuine sense of narrative stakes and ambiguity too, not only from the idea that we never know when the Moon Dwellers will attack next, but the general sense of uneasiness the narrative presents too. There\u2019s always a sense of danger in the air; a sense of looming dread and fear, which permits itself into much of the narrative, which actually does a good job at making me fearful for each one of the Gems, and there is a genuine sense of sadness and melancholy when one of the Gems is defeated and taken away. You feel the weight of this loss, as the other Gems do, making it all the more powerful when these moments in the show do occur. The show does leave many questions unanswered however, and some plot points haven\u2019t yet been resolved as the manga is still running alongside the show, but what the show does cover manages to provide a solid foundation for a second season to greatly build upon, with enough time in this season devoted to establishing the world and the way in which the gems work in said world, all of which is solid enough to stand by itself I believe.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the show\u2019s biggest strength is in its characters and their charming and fun interactions between one another, and, despite not each one receiving development or attention, their unique personalities and characteristics result in some wonderfully funny moments and scenes which makes the characters rather likeable, and these were some of the best moments in the show for me. They all have delightful chemistry, and one of the best examples of this great character dynamic is a scene in which all of the gems freak out at seeing Phos\u2019 newly gained abilities and seeing how each different gem reacted was pretty damn sweet, adding onto their respective characters. All of the characters, in some form or another, is given some level of introspection and time to breath, allowing the audience to understand their perspectives on the world, from Yellow Diamond\u2019s perception as a result of being the eldest, to Antarcticite regarding her unique, and isolated role during the winter, all adding onto our understanding of the world. There are plenty of characters I could talk about, but I\u2019ll just discuss the characters with the most bearing on the plot. \\n\\n\r\nPhos, our main character, is one in which is a representation of a child growing up in harsh world, and learning to mature in that time. Being the youngest of all the gems, and wanting to grow and prove herself, she eagerly jumps into action in order to do so, resulting in many accidents in which she has to either be saved, or put back together. You may find yourself kind of annoyed by how much Phos messes up at first, since it seems that almost every episode she ends up having to repeat this process, but these mistakes end up shaping the person she will become in the future and aiding her development. As the series progresses, and she realises the gravity and danger of fighting against the Moon Dwellers, after seeing one of her friends perish protecting her from them, her character embarks on a change into maturity, with a much more serious demeanour than before. In the final episodes of the show, she even reflects on her past self, stating that she was jealous of her immaturity, reflecting in her change of character as a result of the harsh reality of the world. Phos character, while perhaps coming across as maybe rather obnoxious, especially in the beginning of the series, was still able to make me laugh a numerous amount of times and I could excuse most of it on the grounds of her age and lack of knowledge about the world. Her character is pretty reltable as well, since we too have been in postions where the world seems to treat you like a child, and that feel of wanting to desperately grow into maturity is one Phos manages to encapsulate rather well. She is also pretty damn likeable, I would argue anyway, which helps the audience to become more invested in her character from the get-go, and the mental trauma and hang ups she faces in the latter half of the series is genuinely interesting. Much of Phos\u2019s drive in the narrative, mainly in the earliest parts of it anyway, was her desire to help a fellow gem by the name of Cinncibar, a gem who secluded herself away from the rest since her body secretes a poison. While you may find yourself kind of frustrated at first since this plot point is kind of negated for a while, it does see some kind of resolution in the final episode of the show. \\n\\n\r\nAnother character whom gets a nice amount of development is Dia. Aside from being best gem in the series (seriously, I wanna hug her so damn bad) Dia\u2019s development, and character arc in general is all about proving to herself, and to the person whom she loves, that being Bort, that she is more than capable of looking after herself and in the tenth episode of the show, there\u2019s a wonderful moment where indeed she does do so, when fighting off against one of the new Moon Dweller types, cementing her character as one that is grounded in the narrative, and has a lot of emotional weight behind her too, so much so, that I generally care for her whenever she is in danger or feeling melancholic, and many of the characters presented in the show are like this too. Whilst many are fairly simplistic, again, they feel like genuine people in this world, and have enough in the way of distinguishable personalities to carry the emotional weight of the show, while also showcasing different levels of complexity and depth, such as in the case of the Doctor of the gems, who we learn later on pursues the art of the gems in order to help her long lost friend, or in the case of Antarcticite when she hugs the sensei, believing nobody is standing there to see her do so, revealing a softer side to her character than we were led to believe at first. The characters in this show are easily the strongest element and is the main reason why I had so much fun watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, Houseki is pretty damn solid overall! The CGI in this show looks damn amazing, and move with not only a lot of fluidity, but also quality too. They move gracefully when in combat, and it never comes across as jarring or clunky in the slightest. I also just love the designs for each of the gems too, in particular, their hair. I love the way in which it sparkles, gently illuminating the gems\u2019 uniforms, with perhaps Dia looking the greatest in that regard. The fight sequences are also of a damn great quality, with dynamic and interesting cinematography, and just the way the grass is animated too, and how beautiful it looks, are all small things that I can appreciate, and, again, help the world feel more alive and vibrant. The OST for the show as well does a fantastic job at immersing me into this world, with its often whimsical and mystical tone, complementing the sense of ambiguity the narrative tends to encapsulate. The opening track as well does a great job at capturing the feel of the show, mainly used to represent the loneliness and isolation of Cinncibar to master fall affect.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I loved Houseki quite a fair bit. It\u2019s narrative and world is immediately captivating to me, its characters all feel memorable and have wonderful chemistry between one another, grounding them in a sense of believability, and the animation is some of the best I have seen from a CGI production. Surprisingly, the director of Love Live, actually directed this show too (goddam Love Live will follow me until the day I die, I swear), and he did a good job, especially when we compare the CGI in both respective series, and see how much of a jump Houseki was in overall quality. While certainly not a perfect show, Houseki represents what I love in anime, and that is passion. It feels as if so much love and work was put into this production, and it really does show in many faucets of the show, and I would greatly recommend this. While I didn\u2019t go into as much detail as I usually do when reviewing a show, as I wanted a potential new viewer to watch this show without knowing too much, there is still a lot of potential things to discuss regarding the narrative, with the biggest one being the obvious allusions to that of Buddhism the show seems to have, which I never even touched upon, and a deeper speculation into the sensei character and who he truly may be. Houseki, is truly the gem of the year in my opinion, and sadly one that will be greatly over-looked, but hopefully I may have convinced someone out there to give this show a shot\u2026 maybe. (Just remember to say that Dia is best gem or else I'll sleep under your bed at night!)\\n",

            "content": "It\u2019s unfortunate that many people overlook and under rate CGI based series, me included. But after reading the synopsis and watching 4 episodes, I\u2019m glad I made the decision to watch Land of the Lustrous. I guess you can say this is the\u2026Hidden gem of the season \\(\\~_~)\r\nOut of all the anime that aired this Fall, Houseki no Kuni caught my attention the most. With its oddly intriguing story along with the setting and characters. The characters of this series are gems. You know, Diamond, Jade, Alexandrite, and the other ones. Each gem has a certain hardness, how easy they can break. One of thevery weak gems are our main characters, Phos and Cinnabar. I did not do any research so I have no idea about how each gem acts and their exact information. But the anime does well to explain enough the characteristics of each one.\\n\\n\r\nBasically the Gems or Jewels task is to fend off against like, Moon Dwellers? They constantly fight the gems to kidnap them for the purpose of decoration. Of course, being gems, it\u2019s understandable. With this, Land of the Lustrous does well to present an action packed, scenic filled, colourful, atmospheric anime for us to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately for Phos, her task doesn't come with badass fighting scenes, her (I know they\u2019re genderless, so i\u2019m just gonna refer to these as girls cuz they're more feminine than anything else) job is to write down notes for an encyclopaedia and make history. Not so fun is it. Being an easily breakable gem, Phos had it coming.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is quite amazing with its catchy opening and insert songs. The sfx used as well is amazing and the overall music just fits perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is definitely a strong point, despite the CGI that it has. It flows nicely and the action scenes and cinematography is spot on.\\n\\n\r\nI am pretty tempted to read the original source to see how it differs, but I do hear that the adaptation is pretty well made, so no complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting performance of course is very good as well, each character has an appropriate voice for those characters. It fits and it makes me feel for them more.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for this series is beyond the roof. To the calm, SOL feeling situations, to the action packed and serious scenes as well. Although the tone shifts could make people see this series differently, I do believe it has a more positive impact than a negative one. I enjoy each character and the different types of jewels and the use of their \u201chardness\u201d rank. I love how some gems are fragile and some aren't and they use that nicely in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime needs more attention, just because something is cgi, does not mean it can\u2019t present a good story driven anime with good characters within a good setting. Houseki no Kuni deserves a lot more. If you have time at all, I really do recommend watching this anime, because It won't be a waste of time.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I am writing this review because I believe I hold an uncommon opinion. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s spoiler free. Allow me the time to tell you a story.\r\nOnce upon a time, a little boy was shopping at a mall with his mother, when he passed by a brightly lit shop window sporting an inviting neon sign at the entrance, labelled simply \u201cCandy.\u201d The display case under the sign had a large, swirly lollipop in it, each swirl being a different color. Eager to satisfy his taste buds with the sweetness of a candy he has never ever seen before, the boy tugged on his mother\u2019s coatcollar, begging for her to buy him the seemingly delicious treat.\\n\\n\r\nThe mother, not even bothering to look at the price tag, took a single glance at the ridiculous lollipop and told her son, \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it, I\u2019ll buy you something else.\u201d Being a stubborn little boy, he sat down onto the floor and refused to move a single step. Exasperated, the mother led the boy into the shop and paid for the candy.\\n\\n\r\nThe boy, overjoyed at his victory over his mother, licked his lollipop with vigor. After a few licks, he noticed the lollipop didn\u2019t taste proper. Taking a look at it, he noticed that he\u2019s been blending the different colored swirls with his disobedient tongue. Despite realizing this, the boy noticed that there was nothing he could do to salvage his ruined lollipop. Not knowing what to say to his mother, he finished it silently. \\n\\n\r\nLater that night, the mother asked the boy, \u201chow was that lollipop?\u201d The boy, not wanting to admit his own wrongdoing, plastered a smile over his face and replied, \u201cit was great.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhat is the moral of this story? There are a few.\\n\r\n1. Just because something is new and fancy, it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s good.\\n\r\n2. A weird blend of themes and flavours will not always leave a good taste in your mouth.\\n\r\n3. Mainstream consumers do not want to admit the faults in their initial judgement.\\n\\n\\n\r\n<Artstyle and initial thoughts: 10/10>\\n\r\nHow does this relate to the anime Houseki no Kuni? It should be quite clear. The \u201cinnovation\u201d in this series is the usage of CGI. In the brief history of anime I\u2019ve had the pleasure of experiencing, there has not been an instance where CGI was used well. Naturally, a show that executes a controversial style well would receive positive attention. Admittedly, the artstyle for this show suited its purposes well enough, so I have no complaints. In fact, talking strictly cinematography, art and sound, this show is unparalleled at creating an immersive atmosphere. Now, if that\u2019s the case, why did I imply that the show \u201cisn\u2019t good?\u201d Speaking of the show\u2019s purposes, you\u2019ll see soon enough.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is complicated in many ways. Plot, characters, setting, all of it. Allow me to clarify. Complex shows are not intrinsically bad, in fact, that\u2019s far from the truth. However, shows that end up complex due to blatant execution issues are BAD. Not even god tier art can carry such an aimless, thoughtless story.\\n\\n\r\n<Setting and Plot: 3/10>\\n\r\nLet me start with the setting. The worldbuilding in this show is highly fantastical, and the explanation behind how everything ended up the way it was sounds like something a 13-year-old whose idol is his geologist grandpa would come up with. Sure, it\u2019s ludicrous, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with a good laugh, but I digress. The premise of the show is surprisingly amazing for philosophical explorations on rational sentience and immortality. On top of that, the CGI artstyle compliments this setting very well, leading to some extremely beautiful scenes. Sounds like fun and lollipops, right?\\n\\n\r\nNo. Here comes the plot. The first two episodes work to introduce the characters and the world, but it suffers from a major writing issue. It leads you to believe that this show is a social commentary emphasizing on the hierarchical nature that results from self contained communities, and how each character suffers as a result of their own mental insecurities and lack of identity. That doesn\u2019t sound too bad, if it actually followed up with what it set itself up as.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a series of slimy (ha, ha.) events, you find yourself in a confusing spot halfway through the show where you start to wonder where this show is going. Remember what I said about the setting being an optimal one for philosophical exploration of unique themes? You actually get some of that. Just three lines of dialogue unrelated to the plot, then the show wants you to forget about everything that happened in the first half of the show in favour of some shounen style character development, which is carried out for the remainder of the show, to my massive disappointment. Sadly, the first half of the show provided weak narrative exposition at best and pretentious, irrelevant babble at worst, and this was actually the good half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nDo you like repetitive, meaningless fights with no emotional implications or plot strings attached to it? This was the case with most of the fight scenes in Houseki no Kuni. The typical end result of each fight is that our main character \"develops.\" You'll see what I mean.\\n\\n\r\n<Characters: 2/10>\\n\r\nDon\u2019t we all love that classic slice of life \u201cconclusion,\u201d where a stupidly dramatic event drastically alters the characters beyond recognition, in a weak attempt to add dimension to the cast? Wait a second, I hate that. Referring back to the plot section, I mentioned that the first two episodes set the show up for a character oriented exploration? I guess it wasn\u2019t completely off the mark, if Dora the Explorer is your type of \u201cexploration.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is usually defined by a single, one dimensional trait that dominates their entire character. This is evident in Diamond, Cinnabar and Bort. The rest of the many characters are not worth mentioning. There is some very weak development by the end of the show, but this was not the anime\u2019s focus.\\n\\n\r\nMy dear Phosphophyllite. You developed so much, its almost as if you underwent a chemical change (pun and sarcasm intended). This character\u2019s journey of self discovery was the aim of the show, yet her changes are not only inconsistent with her former self, ridiculously dramatic, but also violates the laws of chemistry. The sequence of events that led up to who the character became by the end of the show was definitely the result of inadequate planning and incompetent writing, evident by a chain of stupidly dramatic incidents that served no other purpose than to turn Phos into a more dynamic character.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps you don't agree with my criticism that Houseki no Kuni's characters lack depth, if you've seen the show. It's difficult to argue this point without spoiling anything, but I'll say this: our only knowledge of Phosphophyllite is her current desires and motivations, which progress from a linear lack of self worth to a sentimental attachment to a certain dead character following a short time skip. Both of these plot devices lack narrative backbone and portrays Phosphophyllite as incredibly shallow and her actions extremely simple. There was not a point in the show where I questioned the motives or psychological states of a single character, because this shallowness is present in the entire cast. There simply isn't enough information or character exploration in the show.\\n\\n\r\nMy last point lies in my disappointment that the basic premise of immortal people was not evident at all in the characters\u2019 behaviour. In fact, every member of the cast acts like a 21st century high school student, which ruined the immersive atmosphere the art desperately tried to create.\\n\\n\r\n<Final Thoughts and total score: 5/10>\\n\\n\r\nIt may be clear by now, but my biggest issue with this show is the obvious lack of direction in its narrative, mismanagement of dramatic structure and insignificant ending. I am aware that the anime does not adapt the entirety of the manga, but hey, I\u2019m just reviewing what\u2019s here right now.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show? If you\u2019re interested in sitting through a 12 episode tech demo, be my guest, but don\u2019t place many expectations on the storyline to provide a compelling analysis of a theme, or the characters to bring any entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nI will reiterate that the art was beautiful. There is no denying that. After all, isn\u2019t a big, swirly, colorful lollipop enticing? Just don\u2019t forget, mommy warned you...\\n",

            "content": "I have to say... As of writing this review only 4 episodes have aired, but I'm confident enough to say that watching this anime is a very uncomfortable experience. \r\nIf you don't already know (like I did at first) this is a CGI based anime (think RWBY and the like). Now, I have no problem watching anime or shows created in this style, but there were a lot of issues with how this was executed, which really detracted from the show. But more on that later.\r\nStory - 4\r\nThe main premise of this show is that there are these humanoid gems that are assigned specific jobsbased on their hardness and gem type. Our main character, Phos, is the weakest gem and is assigned the task of recording new information into an encyclopedia because she is too weak to fight. Meanwhile, the gems are being attacked by beings known as \"Lunari\" who want to use them because they're valuable or something.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot seems simple at first glance, but it actually is quite convoluted. I blame this on the fact that there are many characters and when there are many characters, it becomes difficult to focus on the big picture. I honestly still don't know what the main objective or plot of the story is. \\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming part of the story is the fact that it sticks to the world building. I think it would be very easy to ignore the world the characters live in and pretend as if it doesn't matter, but it's refreshing to see each episode incorporate parts of the world and its volatile 'nature' into the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 1\\n\\n\r\nThis is the biggest problem in the whole show. I know that art style is very rarely important enough to affect the quality of an anime, but this is one of the exceptions.\\n\\n\r\nI will concede that SOME parts of the CGI animation are done really nicely, to an almost impressive degree, but unfortunately it does not make up for how often the CGI isn't that great.\\n\\n\r\nYou will begin noticing this from the very beginning of the first episode. The show is LAGGY. Characters will in one moment be flying across the screen, kicking bad guys in the face, and then in the next be struggling to move their arm 10 degrees. It's honestly really annoying and it happens A LOT. Even in some of the more important scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nThe worst part is that it tends to lag on the character's facial expressions, making them look stagnant at places or just awkward. It kind of deprives the viewer from a part of the character experience because half the time a gem is trying oh so hard to move her lips before they cut to someone else.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the fact that some characters just look better than others. Not in terms of design, but in terms of quality. I mean, I don't understand why the gem master has to look better than our main character. It's like looking at one character without your glasses on and then looking at another with them on. That's the only way I know how to describe it. \\n\\n\r\nI will admit that I'm the type of person who believes that CGI in general, in its current state, is not pleasant enough to look at. Live action movies can get away with it because for the most part, the scenes with CGI are brief enough that you don't notice the flaws or there is only one thing that needs to be animated. Making a show out of it is just... ugly. Making a show out of it and having it constantly lag is annoyingly ugly. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 4\\n\\n\r\nI can't tell if this is a problem with the CGI or if the voice acting just isn't that great. The characters often sound lifeless, but it may just be because the CGI is so terrible at times that whatever the VAs are saying doesn't match up with what we're seeing. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are great though. I'm not sure if they fit the show in particular, but they're catchy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5\\n\\n\r\nLike I said earlier, there's a ton of characters. They're all mostly tropes with a few things that distinguish themselves from each other. They're not bad, but not really memorable either. Overall it's pretty average.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRight now, I don't really enjoy this show. I blame it mostly on the CGI and I feel as though it were in a more traditional style, it would be easier to watch. I don't think it's a terrible show, but I do feel as though the CGI turns people off, as it should. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is that the show is not strong enough on its own to hold up this new style. The plot is okay, but it's not memorable. No one is going to look through their watch list and remember the story in vivid detail. No one is going to be making highly analytical posts about this show. The CGI doesn't add anything to the show, but there are about a million little details a traditional style could add. \\n\\n\r\nAt best, the show will entice viewers to read the manga, which artistically represents what this show is about while still preserving the quirky designs of each character.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "At the time of writing this review, four episodes have aired.\r\nI've finished catching up to the manga (60 chapters) and will be purchasing them shortly. \r\nSTORY: Gems in humanoid form fight unknown entities known as the \"Moon-People\", their hardness and gem type dictating their overall strength and ability to fight. The story has a very distinct feel to it, but I'm not surprised only about 20k people have this show currently listed. Although great in my opinion, it's rather niche. If you're into sci-fi type stories, this is for you. Don\u2019t just write it off as some \u201cSteven Universe\u201d rip off, because 1) it wasmade before S.U., 2) it\u2019s a worthwhile view/read. Later on in the series it will get a but off the rails and the feel of everything is turned on its head. Needless to say, dark. Despite the drastic shift in tone, I still would highly recommend watching until the end. The pacing is about one or two chapters per episode, and I find it fitting. It doesn't seem drawn out or too fast, which is great, especially for a twelve episode series. The tone shift that will occur in later episodes will without a doubt ruin it for some viewers. It all feels very left field for some, which is understandable. Just a point I wanted to bring up.\\n\\n\r\nART: Similarly to the manga, it has a very cool, stylish, and clean-cut art style that is very appealing right off the bat. Although not extremely detailed like other manga in the current market, the style has such a unique atmosphere that others lack. I feel like a lot of people dislike the 3D, as they look back to the ONA's 2D animation and find it better than what we received. However, I find it rather fitting. The ONA showcased lackluster animation, which, though most likely would have stayed more true to the manga (and allowed for more expressive animation), looked relatively odd. In the new artstyle, the hair's shine and the facial expressions are actually gorgeous, and the character mannerisms are cute and energetic. I can't wait to see how they adapt the more...\"exciting\" parts of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The sounds of clanking and cracking that the gems produce are VERY nice, as it, well, sounds like gems. The voice acting is very relaxing, smooth, and high quality. Phos' voice is rather irritating, but it's fitting for their character. I\u2019m a native Japanese speaker and I have to say that the actors are really into their role, and their emphasis on certain phrases or lines just makes the character acting so much more effective in my opinion. Especially Phos, as they have a very childish way of speaking and the VA does an amazing job of portraying this. The others aren't as noteworthy, but are stellar performances nonetheless. In terms of music, gorgeous. The OP and ED weren't favorites at first, but now they've grown on me and I LOVE them both. The OST used in the series is really nice, especially the battle theme. I can't wait to hear what other songs come out of it. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Staying true to the manga. Some characters' colors are being changed from the originals to better reflect the gem they're based off, and personally, I find these versions much more appealing. (Diamond, Morganite.)\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: Recently, I finally got around to binge-reading the manga, as I had started a while ago but never finished. Of course, I can't say much on that (spoilers and such), but I can't wait to see how they adapt some characters and their designs, as well as more exciting action scenes later on. I love Phos, I love the story, I love the sound...But Houseki No Kuni will only be receiving a 8/10 for now, as it has yet to display to me the peak of what it can accomplish with this adaptation. I hope to see a season 2, as I'm sure the 12 episodes that will be airing cannot cover most of the manga as it is. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR; If you don\u2019t like the CG or aren\u2019t intrigued by the plot so far, you might as well skip as it\u2019s very niche.\\n",

            "content": "I will only say that as a \"veteran\" anime viewer I look for things that feel original and a departure from stories and devices that I have seen many times already. This is why I decided to check this and boy, I enjoyed it so much.\r\nTake into account: this story is darker than it seems and based on an ongoing manga. The anime does not provide a final closure for the story. Anyway, I enjoyed it a lot and certaily recommend it.\r\nStory: 9\r\nIntriguing. There is a central mystery to be solved and many other things we don't know. But the story so far is progressingat a good pace and giving us new bits of information every episode. Also Phos, the main character, is going under certain development. I've read that there are surprises coming our way and I have my theories about it, so I am excited to see what will happen. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 \\n\r\nI love the use of CGI here (this is a 1st for me), I started watching only for the pretty. The show is visually stunning, some action scenes are plainly jaw-dropping. The sceneries are awesome and the gems are shiny and wonderful. I don't mind that they look a bit rigid being CGI, I would expect a crystal to be sort of stiff, so for me it works. The story and dialogs are more than enough to make me feel they are full of life.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nAll the gems have distinct personalities and I like Phos, the main character, she is weak but stubborn and desires to be a useful part of society, she struggles and is not there quite yet. It feels relatable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIt started as a light entertainment with lots of eye-candy. But after episodes 3-4 the story gets more intriguing, the characters predicaments more complex, and I was hooked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 10\\n\r\nI have to give it a 10 since this anime has left a lasting impression in me. The production values are high, the quality of animation (and music, and voice actors...) is superb (unless you truly dislike CGI). The story is innovative and characters are fleshed out, although we only follow major development for the protagonist, Phos.",

            "content": "Now I have finished the series, and it has brought me great enjoyment. There are moments that I laugh, I cried a bit and cursing Phos for being so useless or so annoying. But slowly, I realised Phos character is so relatable. \r\nIt is very common for us youngsters to dream an ambitious dream, while not realizing how much effort and pain one have to go through before one can achieve that dream, and eventually hit hard by the reality. It usually starts off as \"it's so cool, I want to be like that.\" to \"I am not good enough.\" \"I wish I could bethat good.\" \"why couldn't I become as good as 'that someone'.\" \\n\\n\r\nMany of us might not truly accomplish something even though we thought we had tried our best. Or there are moments we felt so helpless and just wish to hide and take cover, think that the pain will go away by itself, while in fact, the pain stayed. We are too eager to become adult, but when we truly become one, we start to miss our naive days as a spoiled child.\\n\\n\r\nI particularly like one of the headers the publisher used for the manga series:\\n\r\n\"A beautiful story of the strong, yet fragile, Gems.\"\u3000\u300c\u5b9d\u77f3\u305f\u3061\u306e\u5f37\u304f\u3066\u3082\u308d\u304f\u3066\u7f8e\u3057\u3044\u7269\u8a9e\u3002\u300d\\n\\n\r\nI find the CGI anime very fluid, compare to what I have seen previously in other anime (you know them), Land of the Lustrous (Houseki no Kuni) doesn't have that awkwardness that often, and the background are animated very lively. 'Such a lovely island' is what I first thought when seeing the bird view shot. The complex camera movement makes the fight scene looks luxurious and breathtaking as if you are one of the arrows approaching the Gems, or the sword in the Gems hand.\\n\\n\r\nTo be true, the music is the thing that kept me watching the series. I have like the music composer since his \"Eccentric Family\" days. Although I didn't know it was the same composer when I watch the first episode, but the music was so intense and bring the essence of the scene out, I felt like I must check out who is it, and came across a familiar name, which I am happy to see him in this project, because he did it well in \"Eccentric Family\". I love the tune in episode preview the most, and I believe it is also the main theme music of the series.\\n\\n\r\nI have seen a lot of people say they hope the character or animation stayed the same as in their previous PV, but I personally like the 3D design better.\\n\r\nThe CV did their job nicely, well, excellent job. Whether it is Phos's yelling, complaining, Diamond's caring and gentle voice, or Bort's harsh and fierce tone. I find them nicely blend together.\\n\\n\r\nThe most enjoyment I had for this season was from Land of the Lustrous. Some say the character development is a bit too slow, personally, I think the events are necessary for the character. Therefore the story should not go quicker than this. Drop the series simply because they spent time planting the hints here and there in the first two episode (what we call world building), is gonna make you lose the upcoming candies.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a hidden gem of the season! Definitely, recommend a watch, be patient with our main protagonist, Phosphophyllite. He/she, well they're all genderless. The story truly has a meaning, try at least 3 episode, you will then start to understand the theme.",

Wow.\r\nI managed to miss this one last season and just caught up with it over this weekend; I had nothing better to do last night, so I thought I\u2019d investigate the first episode of the weird CGI mineralgirl show.\r\n\u2026and then marathon-ed the whole thing from start to finish. Literally sat there without getting up for anything like it was a five hour movie. It\u2019s brilliant; I had no idea there was something out there that could so easily topple Made in Abyss from my AOTY spot for 2017, but there it was (and I really liked Made in Abyss). \r\nIf you\u2019renot already aware, the very basic premise is that a small society of immortal, androgynous mineral-people are fighting a thousands of year long war against creepy, shiny buddhist ghosts called \u2018Lunarians\u2019 who want to kidnap the mineral people and take them away to the moon. \u2026even if it wasn\u2019t also brilliant, it has originality going for it in spades! Should you have the ability and time, I strongly recommend you at least give the first episode of this a try, so here are some (spoiler free!) reasons to do so;\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the hybrid 2D/CGI animation is gorgeous in a way that I\u2019ve never seen anywhere else. Anyone who avoided this one because of a prejudice against CG animation, please give this one a chance! I think the slightly surreal and artificial setting helps, but the way the show takes advantage of the underused strengths of CGI and the seamless blending with traditional 2D is stunning. I\u2019ve always been a big advocate of the Polygon CGI shows and movies, but the natural movement and expressiveness of the models in HnK make the characters in Sidonia and the new Godzilla look like awkward plastic mannequins in comparison. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019d be easy to point to the fantastic gem effects as the biggest strength of the CG stuff, but to be honest it ended up being the \u2018camerawork\u2019 that really impressed me there. There\u2019s a scene in particular in Episode 10 where a character is running and hiding from a pursuer, that\u2019s done in a single long, unbroken take following them around the room; it massively ratchets up the tension in the scene, and it\u2019s something that just wouldn\u2019t have been practical to do in 2D with the time and budget constraints of a TV anime. There are also several action scenes that reminded me a lot of the best 3D manoeuvre gear fights in the recent run of Attack on Titan, but the CG elements that make that kind of movement possible are much more fluidly incorporated here in HnK.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t CG for the sake of saving money or cutting corners. This is properly harnessing the \u2018new\u2019 tech to do things you couldn\u2019t achieve with the traditional methods. \\n\\n\r\nSecond is the writing. I\u2019m generally not a huge fan of single-cour shows; the vast majority of them feel to me like two-cour scripts that have been viciously hacked down to 12 or 13 episodes. The pacing is often odd, character development gets weirdly accelerated or suddenly cut off, endings come out of nowhere or are disappointingly anticlimactic. It\u2019s only very occasionally that something like Death Parade comes along, where a single cour manages to feel like a complete and satisfying experience. Houseki no Kuni is definitely getting added to that short list.\\n\\n\r\nThere are characters in this show that get introduced and have complete arcs across 20 minutes of screen time that I cared more about than protagonists from shows that ran to 50+ episodes across multiple seasons. The simple but memorable and conveniently colour-coded character designs do a lot to make every one of the fairly large cast distinctive, but the writing and direction is a masterclass in characterisation using small moments and minimal dialogue. Unusually again for a mostly CGI show, there\u2019s always a lot going on in the background in HnK, and even the most minor characters all get to display plenty of personality in their expressions and reactions to events, rather than just standing around like inactive NPCs in a video game. \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Phosphophyllite (Phos, for short) in HnK is a joy to watch. Superficially, they come off as a stereotypical \u2018cheerful well-meaning klutz\u2019, but there\u2019s a subtle introspective depth to them right from the first episode that sets them apart from your run-of-the-mill MC. They start out the show as the youngest and weakest of the group, but the fact that this is a group of powerful, ageless immortals where you could be the useless youngest and weakest individual *literally forever* gives the standard underdog story an edge of hopelessness that really made me feel for poor Phos right out the gate.\\n\r\n\u2028Phos\u2019s character development over the course of the series\u2026 Well, I\u2019m not going to spoil anything at all on that, but it was definitely the most compelling character arc I\u2019ve seen in any anime for a long while. Again, HnK managed to do more with Phos in 12 episodes than I would have thought possible in that limited runtime.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all that, it has some great comedic moments through all twelve episodes. The personality clashes between the various characters often play out in a way that\u2019s totally hilarious, and every joke also ends up giving you more of an insight into them at the same time. The integration of comedy with more dramatic scenes is also done almost perfectly, something which a lot of shows that try to blend the two can stumble on (I\u2019m looking at you, Mahoutsukai no Yome). The comedy always feels natural, and never ends up undermining the drama like I\u2019ve often seen elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nThird is the art direction and music; Houseki no Kuni is gorgeous, and not just \u2018for a CG show\u2019. For me, it\u2019s right up there with Made in Abyss for the best looking and sounding show of the year. The island setting is beautiful, but at the same time bleak, cold and vaguely ominous, and the silent, shining, smirking \u2018buddhist angels\u2019 that make up the Lunarian antagonists of the story are unconventionally terrifying. \\n\\n\r\nThe muted colours of the backgrounds are contrasted by the brightly coloured crystalline hair of the gem-people, the style and exact shade of which was chosen well enough that I don\u2019t think I over had problems telling apart the otherwise identically-dressed characters. \\n\\n\r\nThese character designs remind me a lot of one of the best things about Kemono Friends; in that show, each character\u2019s personality was really cleverly crafted to match the nature of the animal represented in the design, and here they do a similar thing with the real-life gemstones the characters are made of. The gem is reflected the character design, the character design is reflected in the personality of that character, and it gives the whole thing a sense of consistency and verisimilitude.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also fantastic, switching between upbeat \u2018adventure-ey\u2019 orchestral stuff for the more relaxed antics of the main cast, chilling ritualistic percussion for the terrifying Lunarians, and some really beautiful pieces on the Chinese Erhu and piano in some of the melancholy moments. Unfortunately not on Spotify (yet!) but I\u2019m definitely going to see if I can get a hold of this one to listen to independently of the show; it\u2019s that good.\\n\\n\r\n\u2026I should probably stop typing now before this gets any further out of hand than it already has. So sue me, I really enjoyed this and I want to spread that around as much as possible!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Houseki no Kuni is great. Put aside any preconceptions you have about CG animated shows and go watch it.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW WILL BE SPOILER FREE\r\nOutstanding anime, this is my absolute favorite of this year along with Made in Abyss.\r\nStory : \r\nThe premise of the story makes it sound like something you wouldn't expect at all after you're done watching this. It's really misleading, making people think this would be another \"cute\" anime centered around girly characters. Oh it's everything I just described and so much more. \r\nIt starts slowly, developing the main character takes a good chunk of episodes and initially I felt unsure as to  why were we supposed to get attached to her. You understand why very soon. \r\nThroughout the storyit did a job of explaining the nature of this setting and how it comes to be, though be wary of cliffhangers, they're an absolute killer. It does a good job of making the world immersive raising questions after an episode. Even after this first season, one of the entities remains a mystery to the viewers that aren't familiar to the manga, and in a very good way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt :\\n\\n\r\nWow! It's CGI, expect way better than we've seen before. I loved every minute of it, and there are some outstanding shots in the anime that do the manga a lot of justice. The cinematography is outstanding, especially in one particular episode (you'll know which soon), they've outdone themselves and whoever tried CGI before. Good job to studio Orange.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\\n\r\nAhhh, loved the OP. It's very calming, a soothing voice. The ED is just as good, do listen to the full version of those on Youtube, really nice.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very good, especially the main character and the best girl of the show, loved them. Battle sounds, overall scenery and the music is done really well and it blends in with the scenes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : \\n\\n\r\nIt has a very nice cast of different characters, each with their own virtues, humor and troubles. Not all of them are well developed in this first season, time constraints in mind, but those that do get a lot of screen time are very enjoyable, and funny. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\\n\r\nThis was a great experience, and I intentionally left the character section somewhat empty as I would love for you to go in without any spoilers in this show, it's outstanding. I loved every moment of it and will be jealous of you for having the pleasure of watching it for the first time. \\n\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "[SPOILER WARNING]\r\nHouseki no Kuni is a show where the most boring, flat cast of characters do absolutely nothing for 12 episodes amidst one of the most barren, uninteresting environments I've ever had the displeasure to see.  Ill attempt to break down why this show assumes the audience is brain dead and is generally an offensive watch.  \r\nFirst: what this show does right!\r\nAnimation:  HnK won best CGI in the crunchy roll anime awards, and id agree with that sentiment.  Some of the shot composition is really well done, and the movement is very fluid.  The CGI is well done and nevercomes off as jarring.  I was really excited when i saw Phos laying in the grass as it was truly gorgeous to look at.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:  This anime got an amazing OST it frankly doesnt deserve under any circumstance.  What an absolute waste of brilliant music.  Most of the sound design works well too.  HnK is a joy to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nNow the rest:\\n\r\nCharacter:  The cast of HnK is absolutely forgettable, with the exception of Phos who is so poorly written, it makes me want to gag.  On that note, Ill break down Phos.  \\n\r\nPhos is presented as a character living in a utilitarian society with no utilitarian value.  I found this to be a very interesting and intriguing way to introduce a character arc, especially within the confines of the physical aspects of various crystalline structure.  The first few episodes seem to want to embrace this character arc, as some quick research shows there is some structural merit to Phosphophilyte itself that other crystals dont share.  However, this seems to be too complicated for the author to actually realize, and so HnK decides instead to continually break down Phos's body in favor of other tired and boring gimmicks shared by the rest of the cast.  So we first see Phos broken down via dissolution, which magically gives her the ability to converse with the sea creatures (whose name i cant be bothered to remember), though this is later revealed to be simply the sea creatures selectively conversing with Phos in order to take advantage of her.  Nothing comes of this.  Second, Phos is given legs of a different gem stone which gives her super speed.  Nothing comes of this.  The author clearly cant decide on a consistent way to develop Phos's character and attempts to force Phos into a tragic scenario where they must watch another character \"die\" in front of her eyes.  This scene has no weight as death in this show has by this point been established to have no weight.  Thus Phos comes away from her tragedy with gold and platinum arms that do the exact same thing Cinnabar's body does.  So by the end of the show, Phos's character has been stripped of any chance to shine as inherently unique and replaced by the same stock gimmicks given to the rest of the cast.  Phos only has value when she casts aside her identity.  This is a clear sign the author has no fucking clue how to write a convincing character arc, and this is reflected in the rest of the characters.\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast:  They almost entirely exist in the background making the occasional snarky or edgy comment which constantly falls flat.  Kongo sleeps, and occasionally shows up to be a bad ass, Barts is a diamond thats somehow better than the other diamonds even though black diamond is supposed to be crude (props for working that aspect into her character, making Barts ever so slightly less dull than the rest of the cast).  Diamond tries to be affectionate but gets through to no one.  Everyone else falls into obscurity as quickly as their introduced.  Cinnabar is sad because she is poisonous and no one wants her, but no one does anything about it.  Every one is a one trick pony with no impact and no agency.  \\n\\n\r\nNarrative/ Plot\\n\r\nIts fine for a show to have a boring, flat cast of characters if there is a narrative that holds up the show, but HnK's narrative is non existent.  A bland cast of characters fights a boring monster of the week that goes no where.  How dull.  The biggest sin this show commits is that the writers realize the show is complete garbage and attempt to shift the tone by forcing a tragedy out of no where, but as previously said, this falls completely flat, has no foresight, comes out of nowhere, and just comes off as a lazy attempt to make the show edgy.  HnK is certain the audience is brain dead enough to accept what happens though, but the \"death\" of Antarcticite is frankly offensive as a plot device with Phos being inexplicably trapped in a prison, unable to do anything but watch.  Anyone paying attention knows that no one is actually dying though since gems can always be resurrected at the plots convenience, which was previously established early on.  The plot then attempts to pit Phos against Kongo but goes exactly no where with it.  On a final note is the arc, or rather lack there of, for Cinnabar who is exactly where she started by the final episode.  \\n\\n\r\nIll reiterate:  Houseki no Kuni is a complete train wreck which assumes its audience is brain dead in an attempt to sell pretty visuals and aesthetic as a passable show, and its absolute transparency is frankly offensive to sit through.  I wanted to drop this show at episode 3, 4, 6, 8,9,10 but stayed based on the assurances of others opinions that the show would come through at the end, only finishing the show past episode 10 due to being so close to completion.  \\n\\n\r\nDO YOUR SELF A FAVOR AND JUST LISTEN TO THE SOUNDTRACK THIS SHOW DIDN'T DESERVE AND THINK OF YOUR OWN STORY TO ACCOMPANY THE MUSIC.  YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY COME UP WITH ANYTHING WORSE THAN HOUSEKI NO KUNI.",

            "content": "Gems are regarded as precious things. There are a plethora of these beautiful, varied jewels, each with distinct colors to catch the eye. Out of this shimmering rouges-gallery, the most popular one may be the diamond. \r\nDiamonds are overvalued. They may shine bright but aren't as uncommon as some like to feel they are. However, they are special for some reason or another, above most other gems. Houseki no Kuni, or Land of the Lustrous, really is a diamond in such a sense, fittingly enough. Not the hardest gem or material ever conceived, and more like the character of Diamond in the show, where despiteits hardness, some cracks can certainly show. However, there is a certain charm, a certain beauty to this series, and in fact, a certain catharsis that comes to myriad individuals who have often doubted CGI shows and the inclusion CGI in anime in general, as well as to the people who saw that it could be done right, without a hitch. That last part may not be entire true; a diamond is not without fault. This show is a Diamond, after all, which feels odd given its initial reception. \\n\\n\r\nIn the early days of Fall 2017, this shimmering beauty was not watched by too many, and its reception was lukewarm at best. I distinctly remember a score of 6.98, a score that most in the community would mock given how it seems like anything under a 7.15 is considered to be a waste at best by the community at large, with exceptions to those who see something others clearly don\u2019t and are oft not outspoken. You could say that throughout the the better part of its run, this show really was a \u201chidden gem\u201d, slowly getting better and better, ever more popular, and better-received by the day. Obviously this isn't the case anymore thanks to all the passionate fans that spread the news of this lustrous jewel throughout the 12 or so weeks of its run. Now, it is more akin to a \u201cdark horse\u201d, ironically enjoyed given the vocabulary thus far. Would I claim this is the best of the year? Certainly no. There are a handful of choices that stand out and shimmer even more beautifully, however that is a small handful of gems, not all of which truly got to shine in front of everyone underneath all the rough this year had provided.\\n\\n\r\nGems are oft valuable, tremendously so. Their value is virtually everlasting. Meanwhile, more than half to more than three quarters of a year\u2019s anime offerings are left in the dust within half a year, either deprived of their insignificant value by time, or with none to begin with. Whist Houseki no Kuni\u2019s value is certainly not everlasting, it is one of the few from 2017 that will be fondly remembered for at least a couple years to possibly even a decade, as many gems should. Yet despite how marvelous this jewel turned out, its luster didn't entirely shine initially. It cracked, and it wasn't as beautiful. However, as stated earlier, much like its protagonist, Phosphophyllite, its pieces were picked up, and it hardened, turning from a blight few cared of, into a far more respected work of craftsmanship. It became even more beautiful, intriguing, and varied as well, much like said character. This applies to the visuals and the narrative at large, even if not all the prices were really put back together.\\n\\n\r\nSaid character, Phosphophyllite, reminds me of an exaggerated version of myself. Lazy upon most tasks found to be terribly uninteresting at best and mind-shatteringly stressful at worst, more than willing to get out of said tasks to the chagrin of the one who assigned them, mocked and challenged by many colleagues, frail, quick to aggravate, understood well by a particularly feminine individual considered to be keen on fictionally romantic situations, and sought after by a specific few for a specific quality. My persona reflects this to a large degree given my wording, though my ordinary self embodies much of this as well, with some applying to one part of me than the other. Indeed, this kind of protagonist embodied some aspects I disdain of my two selves, so warming up to it had to happen, which was thankfully effortless to accomplish the more I related on the whole. Not to knock many of the other, mostly less interesting characters with fantastic chemistry with this one to the point of leading to myriad moments of sheer hilarity. However, it is rather apparent that Phos is the true standout of this show, above all else, with the visuals, and the slimy creature, Ventricosus, who managed to perfectly fill most of Phos\u2019 roles in episode 3 to the point of convincing many, including myself that she actually was Phos. The admittedly decent, yet immense and relatively unexplored cast was ultimately saved from mere relative decency by Phos almost exclusively thanks to the charm Phos has and the chemistry it and the other gems have, which is unfortunate, though other anime that concluded this season with an unexplored cast and a main character that grows a ton and learns about the world, have fared far worse in this regard. The fact that Phos develops in ways that affect it detrimentally as a living being as more of the Phosphophyllite we once knew is stripped away, including any sense of satisfaction of accomplishing anything anymore, is also engaging, even if sometimes it feels like we only really see the results of the development, feeling as if we skipped an episode dedicated entirely to said character growing weary and possibly depressed after the new powers acquired after a situation that sparked this gigantic change in Phos\u2019 life.\\n\\n\r\nAnother monumental aspect of this series\u2019 charm and acclaim, as well as the largest point of the overvalue is the visual department. The CGI character designs are certainly fantastic, especially in terms of the shimmering and detailed hair that dictates which gem each individual is. The hair sometimes goes above and beyond, such as with Diamond\u2019s hair that constantly shines multiple colors and creates a heavenly light in the dark. I do find it odd that the series focuses more attention on their attention-grabbing derriere than even Code Geass and Sword Art Online, especially when all of them, despite most of them being abjectly feminine in nearly way, are considered genderless. Even worse, the models have absolutely sluggish frame rates, and when they move in tandem to the well-done environment, the difference in frames feels awkward to put it politely. However, the choreography in the fight scenes is rather impressive, and combined with the dynamic camera movement a CGI series allows, as well as the stellar designs and interesting effects of the anthropomorphised gems and materials, it isn\u2019t a surprise that this show is heralded as a fantastic action show, let alone a fantastic CGI action show. Special praise must also be given to the visuals of the ending theme for its magnificent 2D visuals that are unlike anything I have seen, to the point where I cannot accurately describe what kind of two-dimensional visuals they are, other than magnificently colorful and charming. I can certainly say as well that the issues the first episode presented, visually speaking, got relatively ironed out over time minus the frame rates in the models, like when we reserve 2D for that fantastic ending credits sequence or for impact-related dust clouds and whatnot. Not to sing this series\u2019 praises in terms of visuals as much as others have, but when we see improvements being made to an already visually unique series, especially one done almost entirely by three-dimensional computer animated models, it is certainly cathartic, notably as of 2017, to agree with the visuals looking splendid on the whole. Combining everything with some interesting and trippy moments of introspection with great directing by Takahiko Kyogoku, the team at Studio Orange did a really interesting and relatively fantastic job here.\\n\\n\r\nAnd whist the narrative is rather inviting and willing to slowly reveal more over time, including themes about what humanity was like in the distant past, about life, and how immortals still have plenty to fear much like mortals do, among other things, there are some fundamental issues. For one, for a 2.5/10 hardness rating, Phos is so fragile and weak at times that I could almost swear she was 1.5; even a 2.5 wouldn't break just for stepping on a rock. It also raises consistency issues with how fragile or study Phos is, especially when another gem with a slightly higher rating can take so much more and is infinitely stronger. Also, you have to learn via commercial break and return eyecatchers that the hardness rating is out of 10 unless you already have such knowledge; while it turns out that ultimately, the Mohs scale makes it so that even a .5 difference is monumental, most viewers would be uneducated on the subject and this would need to be told by the series in order to really buy this, which they aren't. Given how memory is stored in the actual gems within every fiber of their being sans their hair to the point of every single shard comprising of memories, how do they consistently gain new memories, and given the seemingly finite amount of space, and their immortality, how can they continually gain new memories for all of eternity? They don't seem to physically grow. When Phos loses her legs, she manages to retain nearly everything important and only really lose memories of one individual and a location she had seen for the first time? Up until the halfway mark, the gems seemed to have photographic memory, and even afterward they mostly do, so it seems like Phos and other can't remember some things for the sake of convenience or emotion, as contradictory as it seems to what impressive memory they seem to display. Given that there are two amethysts that are numbers 33 and 84 respectively, how many of each exact gem are there? The yellow gem has lived for thousands of years, over 3,500 in particular, so you are left to ponder of the age of the likes of Bort and Sensei, who are much wiser and more battle ready? Has sense lived for tens of thousands of years? How long has this conflict gone on? Are none of them tired of life barring CInnabar, who is only sick of everything due to how no one respects it or can find a use for it given its hazardous condition? How exactly does this gooey material all gems have inside them really connect the missing pieces together, and how come we never see any of it splash out when a gem gets slashed or downright shattered into a cornucopia of shards and pieces?\\n\\n\r\nI could go on and on, but the point has long since been made clear as crystal; that being: all of this serves a grander dilemma in that we do not know well enough how this species of gems work, as an inhuman amount of aspects about them are contradictory and unfathomable to try to answer. Not to mention other issues like how only one of them has any semblance of knowing how to use a projectile, and none of them have ever tried that or coming up with experiments to allow long-range combat on their end to possibly surpass the projectile-heavy weaponry of the Lunarans. There aren't too many problems with the active narrative in terms of holes, errors, and progression (at least in the first half), barring a few conveniences and contradictions mentioned earlier and not mentioned at all, as well as a few real issues towards the end, but when it invites you to learn as much as it does, and you try to think of everything, or beyond the most obscenely basic understanding of how the gems work, you end up with myriad questions the series cannot tackle about the world-building or the novel species it is depicting. It would be like a high school biology teacher trying to explore how humans work in an attempt to invite others into such knowledge, yet she only understand a minute aspect of their biology and psychology, infinitely less than the still limited knowledge we already have acquired within the best two centuries about our species, leaving you disappointed as you already know more about the subject than she does by the time you\u2019ve taken the midterm, and there are no more classes on the subject at your school. One could counter back with \u201cthe series doesn\u2019t need to know everything, it even admits that it doesn\u2019t\u201d, however most stories  that explore a fictional species do so enough for you to get the gist of things without delving deep enough and doing things that make you question everything about said species. This clearly wasn\u2019t one of them, and it suffered for that. The fact that they sorta dodge showing us some of the processes involving healing other gems only makes this burn even harder, and the ending is certainly nothing satisfying, amounting to a \u201cwe made it this far and covered ground; wait for more or read the source material\u201d. And you wonder why I'm such a curmudgeon.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and also, while the show does present a few interesting themes to explore, including how these characters deal with immortality, don't be surprised when they start leaving those in the back-burner at best or drop them like flies at worst. It is another glaring flaw in this show preventing it from being one of the crown jewels of the year.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other positives I want to throw out there to really sell that despite the major problems the show has, it is still a laudable show, particularly involving the character arcs Phos and Diamond go through, but I cannot really mention much without spoiling them other than the premises of said arcs. I already mentioned Phos\u2019 so Diamond\u2019s is about learning to get stronger and do things on its own, which while executed almost how you would expect, there is a brutal twist to it near the end of episode 10, to leave it at that for you to speculate. I cannot really do the narrative any more justice in a spoiler-free review, so let me just say that the humor is gut-busting to me and that the show does throw in a few wild surprises in there, some of which nearly had me rolling on the floor in terms of comedy. So now, let me transition into what I feel truly shines as the best aspect of the show: the music. \\n\\n\r\nThe enchantingly melodic tunes of the pieces such as \u201cLunarians\u201d and immensely memorable and emotion-intensive pieces such as \u201cDanger\u201d and especially \u201cCinnabar\" and \"Breaking\u201d make particularly the action scenes and emotional scenes leave even more of an impact than otherwise. Even if some tracks get played too frequently, they simply sweep you into every scene in a way that really invites you in and immersed you. The OP, \"Kyoumen no Nami (\u93e1\u9762\u306e\u6ce2)\" by YURiKA, is among the best this season has to offer, exemplifying a lot of what I mentioned previously about the OST, and the vocals make my love for the song reach ever more. The ED, \"Kirameku Hamabe (\u714c\u3081\u304f\u6d5c\u8fba)\" by Yuiko Ohara, is also fantastic, and is also one of the more emotionally resonant pieces of music in the series, especially combined with its stellar visuals. All in all, the music is simply fantastic, sweeping, and emotional, and I had no idea what to expect from it overall, nearly getting floored with some of these pieces the first time. Unfortunately, only a handful of tracks really get to stand out this way, but it's still more than many have managed to do.\\n\\n\r\nSo, this was Houseki no Kuni. A gem that shines bright enough to become a dark horse of its season and captivate the hearts of many for weeks, as well as set a new benchmark for full CGI anime in the future to strive to live up to. I had a good time viewing and appraising this jewel, even if it isn't as lustrous as its title suggests. So, as always, with all that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "Note: I have not read the source material (manga), so this review will be based on the anime alone.\r\nThe only word I could use to describe the world of Houseki no Kuni (Land of the Lustrous) is \u201cbizarre\u201d. It certainly takes an amazing amount of imagination and a dose of craziness to come up with an unique world like this, but I can\u2019t help but feel that this is also exposed as the anime\u2019s weakest point. It took a lot of time and effort to explain even the basics of how the world works, and even then the world feels difficult to understand. This isnot helped by the fact that unlike sci-fi or fantasy worlds based somewhat on reality, the viewer can\u2019t populate the background of Houseki no Kuni with activity. It's just a barren world that is hard to believe in.\\n\\n\r\nThis overly simplified world is contrasted with a huge ensemble of mostly forgettable characters, often appearing for only a few seconds at a time. This is not helped by the fact that they have long and convoluted mineral/gem names, making them even less memorable. When a character is promoted to the center of the story, they feel as if they serve no further purpose than to forward the plot, and (with the exception of one) become irrelevant within two episodes. The main character Phos is the only one with any semblance of development, but while its shift from from beginning to end is striking, barely anyone else mattered.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is obviously incomplete. While there is a nice connection to the beginning, ultimately it shows you the door to its manga continuation more than anything remotely satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a unique story for sure, but as a whole I don't feel like it's gone anywhere in these 12 episodes, and an overall disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Houseki no Kuni is marked by its generous use of 3D animation, which is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it presents the textures and reflections of the gems very well, and makes for some VERY dynamic fight scenes, but on the other hand, facial expressions and tiny movements (such as head tilting) feels rigid and unnatural. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, this is still probably one of the best and most extensive use of 3D animation I\u2019ve seen so far, and it would be hard to imagine some of the scenes (especially towards the end) without it. But I wouldn't rate it as an unmitigated success -- whether or not it's good is still pretty much up to personal tastes.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are nice, memorable tunes that aren't too generic, but it's the OST and insert songs that shine here. There's an varied selection of styles, and many of the tracks fit the mood of the scene nicely.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Houseki no Kuni is a puzzling anime for me: Puzzling world, puzzling story, puzzling characters, and a lot of it remains unresolved till the end. I would suppose the Manga would provide a lot of answers to my questions, but as a non-manga reader, it's hard to give it a more satisfactory score until the second season is out.",

            "content": "Houseki no Kuni is a story set on an island in a post-apocalyptic world, where a collection of immortal gemstone-based people cluster around the mysterious Adamant-sensei, who keeps them occupied with jobs tailored to their interests and abilities - all except Phosphophyllite, a spoiled child who is too delicate to do the job he REALLY wants to do; fighting the celestial spirit-like Lunarians that are constantly trying to shatter the gems and use them as jewelry. Tasked with creating an encyclopedia to distract him, Phos meets the secluded Cinnabar for the first time, and begins to question what it means to have value.\r\nThe story, despiteits character-driven slice-of-life angle, is primarily written as a mystery. Each arc (the first one concluding in episode 5) is concluded with a drastic change in Phos, and that change is used to give Phos a new perspective on the world he lives in and the secrets Adamant-sensei is keeping.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the first episode is a wobbly start, and the story doesn't do a good job of communicating that it's a worldbuilding mystery of the same class as Kemono Friends or Girl's Last Tour; in those shows, the mystery as at the forefront, constantly reminding you of the question through key references and the protagonist's own interest, but in Houseki no Kuni, Phos blithely goes on his merry way uncaring of the seemingly perfect world around him, buying into the status quo completely. Unless you're asking the questions it wants you to ask (or you've read the more ethereal and painfully lonely original manga), Houseki no Kuni comes off as tonally unstable, despite its straightforward setup.\\n\\n\r\nDespite how badly it's communicated, the story itself is wonderful, and the slow unrolling of the lore with each consecutive episode and conflict is constantly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe CG is designed to emulate mid-quality 2D animation, low frame-rate included, so it's a matter of taste whether you enjoy it or not. The cinematography and post-processing is gorgeous, with fantastic uses of colour and wild, chaotic action scenes, but I wish it better communicated the quiet emptiness of the island and the seas around it; I've seen a few people consider the lack of details 'lazy', but it's more like it's not featureless ENOUGH to get the idea across. The underwater segments probably do a better job of this.  \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, almost none of the beautiful, striking cinematography and sakuga is in episode 1 (barring MAYBE the very lovely scene of a broken Phos), and the Adamant-sensei 3D model is...not very pleasant close-up, but otherwise, the characters are all attractive, with gorgeous and expressive facial animation. Absolutely pinpoint perfect sound design combined with character animation communicates that these are extremely heavy gemstones, as light and human-like as they look when they're not in motion, and the way the lighting accentuates their gem traits is stunning. Overall the best-looking show this season, if only just based on personal taste.",

            "content": "This is my first review, and English isn't my primary language, so excuse some of the grammar mistakes.\r\nTo be honest, I feel like this anime's a bit underappreciated. While some of the things presented in this anime might not be suited for everyone's taste(such as the concept behind the gems and the 3DCG animation, which I'll discuss later on their respective parts), this anime has adapted the manga quite well and faithfully. The manga itself was quite good, and I'd recommend reading it after the anime finishes airing as it shows other things that might not be shown on the anime due to the limitedepisodes(unless they decided to adapt a second season).\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe main concept of the story revolves around immortal and genderless gem people fighting against the moon people who tries to take them away for decorations, which is quite the unique take on 'fighting against unknown forces' plot that's normally often used in other series(either anime or manga). However, when you look deeper upon it, the series also has a life and death symbolism embedded on it, making the series more interesting than it seems on the surface if you noticed them. I feel like the description is a bit misleading, as the encyclopedia part actually doesn't do much to the story itself, and the main story itself is best described as a 'coming-of-age' story, as the main character(Phos) develops as they go through various hardships(like a saying: misery builds character) while trying to help another character(Cinnabar/Shinsha). Being a manga adaptation, each episode represents 2-3 chapters of the manga, which is a fine pace for me(though I was initially a bit concerned on how far it'll adapt).\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe characters are nice and expressive, and the scenery is very well made. The animation is also quite fluid as well, especially during the battle scenes. While 3DCG can be quite polarizing for some people, it can look great if done right, as this anime proves. Because of that, I don't think this anime deserves hate solely because it's CG.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOne of the reasons I decided to watch the anime is how they would sound like, and when I saw the lineup of the voice actors, I had expectations, and they delivered. The voices suit them, and the soundtracks are quite nice as well; they fit the events going on the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters have distinctive appearances(with the gem people looking like the gems they're portraying, even having traits corresponding to them), as well as unique personalities to boot. Some of them can be quite prominent on one point but later aren't shown much, however the story revolving around them gives enough impression on how they look and act. Overall, each of them has their own charm which makes them likable, even though some of characters have more/less screentime than the others.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis show manages to be both refreshing and deep at the same time, and in a good way. With the previews, each episode will leave you wondering about what happens next. The show also has a good amount of humor despite not being a comedy, and what makes them great is that they don't seem out of place, which adds more to the enjoyment factor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nLike said above, while the premise might not be for everyone, I still highly recommend checking this anime. The story might seem a bit slow at first, but it eventually picks up.\\n\\n\r\nI'd give this 9.5/10, since it's a great adaptation of a great manga, but MAL doesn't allow decimals here. I hope they'd adapt another season eventually, but I think it won't be revealed so soon, especially since the anime and the manga haven't been finished yet.",

            "content": "BEAUTIFUL. STUNNING. GORGEOUS. LUSTROUS!  This anime, by far, is the most beautifully animated series I have ever seen.  It is a shining example of how 3D Animation is the future of anime.  I have seen a lot of beautifully animated series in my life, but this one, in my humble opinion, out shined them all.  It was easily the biggest draw of the anime.  I can't ever remember a time where I would rewind just to watch a character run.  But, the animation combined with the motion and camera angles made even running, a spectacular sight.  \r\nNaturally, becauseof the high level of animation, the battles were superb to watch.  Especially in later episodes, as the protagonist, Phos, develops.  Additionally, the character design was fantastic as well.  The gems (who to me seem like girls, but are gender neutral) are all given these incredible hairstyles that are almost translucent.  They were as beautiful as real gems to look at, especially Dia.   \\n\\n\r\nI also really enjoyed the unique premise of the anime, which as you know from the synopsis, follows 28 characters who live alone on the Earth fighting off the Lunarians who want them as decorations.  This threat loomed constantly over the girls who were deeply bonded by centuries together.  So, even though they were immortal, you still felt the loss if someone was taken, through the other characters.   There is a mystery to this anime, that I can't wait to see unraveled in a season two.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, that speaks to an issue with this anime that more and more animes are starting to have: Cliffhanger endings to seasons that don't give any kind of feeling of resolution.  It hurts the story when creators look to angle for a second season by not properly wrapping up the first season in any meaningful way.  What if you don't get a second season?  Cliffhangers are irritating by themselves, but when done in lieu of any kind of ending whatsoever, it's deeply damaging to a series.  This same thing is found in Land of the Lustrous.  Either set up two main driving plots and finish one and leave the other for the second season, or just end the first season properly. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the creators got what they were looking for, because I enjoyed this anime so much, and I want to know what happens next, that I will definitely be looking out for season 2.  \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters are concerned, I liked them all, with the exception of Bort.  The supporting cast was filled with likable characters like Dia, Rutile, Alex and Kongou.  But, Phos is easily my favorite character of the season, and the way this anime handled her maturation as a character was well done.  You watch as event after event changes her in serious ways both physically and mentally.  While physical changes in anime are regular, you rarely see mental changes in MCs that totally redefine the character. Most MC's finish with the exact same personalities that they started with, no matter what traumatic events or swerves they suffer.  Not so with Phos. The changes to her mental psyche are a big part of the anime and an example of proper character development.  \\n\\n\r\nOutside of yet another cliffhanger non-ending, Land of the Lustrous was a fantastic anime, the beauty of which I can't stress enough.  Definitely check it out. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nArt: Over 9,000!!!\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9 (Non-ending hurt it).  \\n\\n",

While it does take a few episodes to really get into things, there is a wonderful mystery to the world and a welcome depth to the main characters. At first it seemed liked the main character Phosphophyllite would be just another annoying lazy one-dimensional protagonist, but she at times shows a surprising complexity that one would not expect from such a lazy whiny freeloader. It wasn't until episode 3 that I really started to see this anime something other than eye-candy, and by the end of episode 4I was so invested in the story that it had snuck up on me to become my most anticipated series. Definitely worth a watch!",

The story of this show is extremely unique and i have never seen anything quite like it. The only thing besides the CG that i think would turn people off is that all of the characters appear to look the same in body type. This is only true for the crystal characters, and there are other species in this show that look entirely different. This show is simply too good to pass up based on these two things, becauseonce you give it a try, you will realize that these two things actually make the show amazing because of how well its creators used these points to their advantage in the story and art. the first episode will capture you and not let you go. All of the characteristics of the crystals were chosen based on real life facts about crystlas, which they studied well and interpreted them beautifully to form the characters. Every episode just keeps getting better as i watch and learn about the different characteristics of the world and it's people. This show is so well done that i have already watched it more than once for the episodes so far and i know i will be watching it many more times.\ufeff As of this review, Episode 10 has aired and i am eagerly awaiting the next episodes. I will also most definately be reading the manga.",

(i remember the new gachaman for the mix of 2d and CGI)\\n\\n\r\nokay, so what i like about this anime is everything about it! seriously. the minimalist design, the cinematography, the breaking and glimmers of the gem are executed gorgeously to show that what species they are suppose to be- a sentient gems/rock. after the 1st episode, i immediately read the manga and finish it in a day and i'm telling you ive read it 4x now and the anime? I lost count. i fell in love with antarc and the impact he have left to the story much more for our mc who never stop to evolve so fast its hard for us to watch. i dare you, you cant just love 1 gem. i want a harem of them :) \\n\\n\r\ndid i mention the amount of references the manga gives to Buddhism? god! the intricate amount of symbolism that fits perfectly to the story is one for you to find out!\\n\\n\r\nif your reading this, don't miss the chance to experience what we have seen so far.

            "content": "Ok, let\u2019s get it over and done with. We all know what you\u2019re waiting for. Those \u201chilarious\u201d statements that everyone is making. Hidden gem of the season. Diamond in the rough. Beating every other show by a landslide. And hey, everyone is right with the overused puns. Houseki no Kuni is fucking great, it really does outshine the rest\u2026 I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ll stop.\r\nFor a show that could be tagged as a tragedy, it\u2019s really lighthearted. Sure it establishes the consequences of their world, with the Lunarians shattering every Gem they can get their grubby mitts on, but you don\u2019t really get a sense of misfortunefrom this story until much later on. Maybe it\u2019s because the characters can\u2019t actually die and can be put back together if they\u2019re taken back from the enemy, but the show does a really good job of switching between it\u2019s serious and comedic moments. One moment someone is drowning in acid or having their eyeball smashed out of their head, then the next everyone is poking fun at the youngest member for being useless. You\u2019re constantly switching between shock and amusement that every scene has much more impact then it would have without it. Many shows try to do the same thing, but often times their comedy can overpower the drama and make it feel too silly. Houseki is able to keep both sides balanced so that it can switch tones with ease.\\n\\n\r\nYou could also consider the story to be a bit of a mystery as you\u2019re left in the dark with some elements of Kongou-sensei, their supposedly trustworthy and parent like master. You get glimpses of moments where things aren\u2019t exactly what they appear to be, leaving you curious for more. However, by the time you reach the last episode, it\u2019s clear the story isn\u2019t made to fit into a 1 cour anime. The story is left unfinished and you\u2019re left aching for a sequel, which is a bit disappointing considering how greatly it drew you into the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe Gems act as the cast for Houseki and they are quite the funny bunch. They don\u2019t sit around acting gloomy over the fact that they\u2019re being chased after by giant wax figures that rip holes into the sky, (Yeah the Lunarians are really creepy when you think about it) most of them act a little like children. Of course, each one has their own jobs that they\u2019re serious about, like scouting, fighting and repairing. They all have this youthful curiosity about them which can be seen very clearly whenever they encounter something new and unknown. Their mentality contrasts against the harsh situation of being kidnapped, broken and rebuilt against your will. Although, with such a big cast of 28 characters, (Probably less since some have already been taken by the Lunarians) only a select few get some proper exploration. If only the show had more time to actually polish a few more of the other Gems so none of them are left to waste, the show would be significantly better. Ha get it? Polish. Gems. Ahahahaha sorry.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, we have to talk about the CG animation before we finish up the review. There are some people that say the show looks laggy to them, but in my honest opinion, I don\u2019t see what they are talking about at all. This is some of the best 3D animation I\u2019ve seen from anime. The assortment of hairdos flowing across the screen, the light refracting off each character, and the manipulated liquid being controlled by certain Gems, it\u2019s breathtaking watching the show every week. The action as well really conveys the frantic panic and trouble they are in when a dangerous Lunarian appears, with the camera continuously pursuing characters as they run, dash, swing and jump into their battles. It\u2019s almost like watching a boss fight in a video game, with the same level of tension and nervousness as you hope everyone will be safe by the end. Houseki no Kuni really makes me excited to see what else I\u2019ll get to see from Studio Orange\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing more to say. This anime blew my eyes out of their sockets with how great it looks, and the story accompanying it is so full of intrigue and suspense that I fell in love with it immediately. The issues I do have with the show are really minor in comparison to everything else it does well, and I highly hope that every else checks out this spectacle for themselves.",

The beginning first few episodes are a bit on the boring side, but once you reach the climax of the anime (around episode 5), the anime will exceed all your expectations. The premise of this anime is really cool too; it's about a bunch of gems that are human-like and they have to fight off these things that are also human-like called \"lunarians\". It's super interesting because you don't really know how they originate so it's really mysterious and enjoyable. There's also many things that happen, so you'll never really be bored (well the first few episodes are a bit repetitive,but you can't expect the anime to drop and be rolling right from the start). Yeah, the animation is CGI but the plot! It's so good and I can't wait for all the episodes to come out :D!",

            "content": "What a great show, out of everything I've seen lately I felt seriously inclined to write a review about this one in particular. \r\nFirst off, the first and last glaring thing on anybodies mind checking this out initially is the CG animation and the immediate discounting that goes along with finding out a show is created in it. In another thousand or so anime I might agree that CG is an unfortunate or poor choice for artistic direction or a compromise to push out a show more inexpensively that otherwise might not have gotten made, In Houseki no Kuni this couldn't be more untrue.\r\nThe CGis not only (for the most part) of incredible quality, but more than that really captures the \"non-human\" aspects of the shows' characters, the gems in particular. From the shine of their bodies, the faint glow cast by their hair, the 'stiffness' of their expressions, and when they get chipped or cracked the 3D aesthetic creates a wonderful effect that I believe wouldn't have looked as beautiful in traditional drawn animation. This is to say nothing of the great work done on the surrounding environment, the CG is far from off-putting apart from a small handful of scenes (We're all looking at you, Cinnabar).\\n\\n\r\nEverything else in this show is lovely, from characters to music 'Land of the Lustrous' creates a wonderfully vivid world and a cast of dynamic characters that make it fun to watch and saddening to put down. If you're looking for something comfortable to watch with occasional action with only some of the shock and none of the gore present in a lot of other well-acclaimed shows in the past several seasons then I would strongly recommend giving this one at least a two-episode chance, you won't be disappointed.\\n",

            "content": "I was recommended this anime by a friend of mine and entered it with a sort of cautious optimism: A quick look at the MyAnimeList page and a Google search showed that this was a rather well received anime with character design that appealed to me that had somehow totally slipped under my radar. I wished to avoid spoilers for the show, so I did not look further, and instead dove right in.\r\nThe show starts off rather quickly and right off the bat, introducing the viewer to the relevant characters and plot points in a swift yet efficient manner, a good pace to start offwith. The setting of the show is interesting and provides for some beautiful scenery shots with the rather nice CGI effects. The CGI might be a turn off for some people, but, well...given my RWBY avatar it should not be surprised I am less bothered by it. It is also rather nicely woven into the show as it enables the characters to look particularly gem-like against the world around them which is most especially notable in the varied, frequently sparkling hair of the cast. Liquid effects, especially some of those later on, are also of notable high quality that contribute to the feel of the show, and plenty of other such things.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself concerns the life of living gem-people protecting their home against the mysterious Lunarians, who wish to turn them into gems for decoration. More accurately, though, the show is a piece of character examination with other show elements sprinkled in, most prominently mystery and some action to go alongside it. This is largely packed into our main character, Phosphophyllite (mostly known as \"Phos\" because...you try pronouncing that constantly as a voice actor), who undergoes quite a large transformation throughout the 12 episode run time. This is probably the most striking part of the show and alongside Akko from Little Witch Academia felt like some of the most natural and realistic character developement I have felt in a while, with changes to how one views the world connecting to goals, outward and inward personality, reactions from others and more. I won't get into much detail since I would be spoiling it, but it is actually quite an impressive feat and while Phos probably wouldn't make my Top 10 anime characters, she has a good argument to be close.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story does firmly focus on the character developement, the other elements of the show are still handled fairly well through it, such as the notable and consistant tone of mystery to it. Not just in the enemies but the setting itself and more which then feeds into the feeling of the setting as this kind of introspective and quiet world. The break of this into action is usually rather seamless and helps keeping the anime from feeling too sleepy, especially with some nice (though not top tier) monster designs. The introspectiveness of the setting feels like it meshes nicely with the high focus on \"change\" as a thematic motif.\\n\\n\r\nPacked alongside Phos is a colorful cast which is quite expansive, especially given it is a 12 episode anime. In fact, if anything, the cast is perhaps a bit too expansive: Being based on an ongoing manga plus the fact it is clearly gunning for more than one season means it is clearly setting up characters for later story developements or as more one note characters fitted to fill roles other characters could not. The fact that this show nonetheless does them well, however, makes this more of a minor complaint. Another complaint I can file with the show is that it feels like the importance given to Cinnabar fails to match her screen time and ability to get to know her, which can leave some scenes as coming off a bit less emotional than intended. This is the more major issue of the two: It did not grate on me really, but it does hitch the story a little.\\n\\n\r\nThis is contrasted by other characters being handled well, with Antarcticite being a standout for me...although I cannot talk too much about them thanks to spoilers. Bort and Diamond are also handled well, their toxic seeming friendship/relationship and how it leads into latter events especially since at first it feels more minor. Or even stuff like Rutile's desire for medical dissection and reconstruction feeds interestingly into later events, giving it more depth to something appearing minor. While I wouldn't call most characters amazing I also wouldn't say a single character actively annoyed me which is rather rare for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this show is gorgeous, although it can at time look a bit too much like a CGI game. The animators are very well aware of how CGI can work and utilize to their advantage: Using the natural shininess and unrealisticness of a lot of CGI, for example, to create the shiny Gems and contrast them against the alien and unnatural feeling Lunarians or the more human Master Kongo. The hardness of the Gems is contrasted by their enemies often having very soft features, dissipating into wisps or even fluffy features and thus create contrast. And both of them look great due to affixing them to the CGI style well. Another thing this show does well? Using the CGI and the fact Gems can be put back together (Not a spoiler, this is established in the first few minutes) to create scenes that would UNDOUBTABLY raise the rating substantially if done on flesh and blood humans...and on top of that, the CGI style makes it all look quite amazing. By eschewing trying to make the CGI look extremely realistic, it instead does amazingly at making it look fantastical. And if you like beautiful 2D animation, the ED of this show has got your back. Also, the action is pretty well animated in this show if often a bit basic for my tastes, and the perspective and movement shots in Episode 10 are gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is quite good, with pretty strong voice acting from the cast all around and some memorable scores such as the sound of the Lunarians approaching. The sound effects on most anything gem-related is nice. The OP is somewhat forgettable, but the ED is pretty nice. The sound is also pretty good at fitting the mood, overall it is pretty good although I would not say it meets he very upper echelon of anime.\\n\\n\r\nHouseki no Kuni is an anime about change. What does it take to change, what does it mean, will you be happy when you do? So interwoven is this theme throughout the anime that to discuss it without spoilers is difficult. But the show tackles it, it tackles it well and it tackles it in a way that left me interested throughout the show. It can start off slowly, too, but that is no reason to fret: Shows, too, can change. While not the best anime ever, I heartily recommend Houseki no Kuni to anyone who is interested in a strong character focused piece and impressive animation. And I am very excited for the prospect of a second season.",

            "content": "Houseki no Kuni, or Land of the Lustrous, is an anime about genderless immortal beings made out of Gems that protect themselves from lunar creatures that appear within the day. This elegant and extremely serene anime is about the sacrifices that one must make in order to improve as a person.\r\nPhosphophyllite is a gem that is basically useless until the day his teacher, Kongo, tasks him with the responsibility of creating the Encyclopedia to record all known knowledge of the island. The task moves him towards much more dangerous situations where many things are sacrificed. In a way of putting it, the character development isnowhere near terrible however one may not wish for it to happen because the more Phos improves, the more of himself he loses. This begins to lead about a lot of questions about the lunar people, the world he lives in and his past, and his teacher. The elegance in the animation, art, and soundtrack compliment all of this beautifully and each episode becomes increasingly more and more interesting with each of the gems personalities being revealed. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is very interesting because it shows that the world that one may live in their entire life innocent and happy but have no idea about the world they have been living in. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wishes to get into anime.",

Finally, we have something to brag to the world that not all CG anime is bad, in fact it could be nearly perfect. An anime adaptation of a manga created by Haruko Ichikawa, Houseki no Kuni, came to us with a handful of good things that CG anime could do.\r\nBecause this is a CG anime, we should really talk about the CG of this anime. Finally, someone utilizes the CG to the camerawork of this anime and gives us the thrill of running through the beautiful night with Diamond, fighting Lunarianswith Bort, or frightening tense while Diamond being chased by Shiro. Those scene would not be captured perfectly if they did not utilize CG technology. In the end, the CG in this anime made a perfect cinematography and an example of what CG anime do next.\\n\\n\r\nAh, soundtrack. I would say the soundtrack of this anime could come toe-to-toe with last year's Made in Abyss' soundtrack. They have this feeling build in the beginning, becoming more and more intense, ended with a perfect closing in every single of their tracks. The soundtrack is one that you should not miss.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself was very outstanding with the character building that I would never forget. I never found myself cried because some character building but Houseki no Kuni successfully broke that and made me cry just because seeing how Phos growing each episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is one anime that you should not miss. After I watching this anime, I have this large grin of accomplishment and wished for more. I was a bit disappointed with myself because I did not watch it when it was airing. Man, why did I not realize a great potential when it was airing?",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThe geological timescale views singular months and years as unregistered blips on a radar.\r\nTo us regular folk, though, even just a tough few hours at work can seem like an eternity. We value our time greatly, thinking about that joke we heard the other day or looking forward to that cool party in the weeks to come. And, as the saying goes, \u201cTime flies when you are having fun.\u201d\r\nThat\u2019s why the here and now is so precious; the present is a valuable existence we can almost never take for granted. In this time, a curiousanime titled Houseki no Kuni emerged, and the fact that we\u2019re lucky enough to have it around should not go unnoticed.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nRorshach-summoned moon entities called Lunarians invade an Earth-like land inhabited by anthropomorphic crystals who devote themselves to their caretaker as difficulties unfold. Such a unique premise sounds rather intriguing, perhaps impossible. Houseki no Kuni, however, embraces this synopsis from the start, refusing to let its initial pull falter.\\n\\n\r\nAn excellent script gives this pull a lot of strength throughout the season with plenty of opportunities. The fun dialogue and the sharp scenes lead to surprisingly comical moments and lively interactions between the rocks as they go about their daily business. It can be trying to \u201cwake up\u201d Sensei, Phos fed up with an unlucky slug, or the lot of them clambering to see a new sight. Whatever the case may be, the anime brings with it a robust sense of timing and direction that equates to an engaging string of events.\\n\\n\r\nThis sense of flow also carries over into the dramatic elements which Houseki no Kuni touts on a regular basis. From a broken body washing ashore beside Cinnabar to the futile attempts of saving another, it becomes clear that its emotional weight balances out its comedic elements with a seriousness that warrants exploration of its meaningful themes.\\n\\n\r\nSuch themes align extremely well with the geode motif at hand. Personal discovery. True purpose. Innate worth. They are just a bunch of rocks, defined by their hardness, durability, and chemical composition, yet they are more than just a smattering of numbers or a litany of letters on a page. Rather, their aspirations of being more, their motivations of proving themselves demand a greater calling. For if even the very stones of the mountains wish for a grander presence, then surely these ideas must have some reputation somewhere.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Houseki no Kuni does not always get it right, especially when particular story beats lack buildup on a writing level. The complication behind Phos, their arms, and the ice floes occurs over the course of a few minutes; Dia separates from Bort and then faces that separation within the span of the same episode; Rutile fixes up their long-dormant friend Padparadscha out of nowhere only to have them sleep again right away. Despite the impressive comedy and drama nearby, these instances demonstrate that the show sometimes values getting to that next crucial plot point over letting it simmer for better impact.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also the trouble of how the last few episodes proceed. That this season definitely comes off as a first-parter when it essentially leaves many of the mysteries up in the air: the Lunarians, what Sensei seems to be hiding, those fish people who were hardly referenced after the first quarter of the season. Meaning, it concludes with a twinge of disappointment at the fact that its plot hasn\u2019t really progressed past anything exactly pivotal.\\n\\n\r\nThis last grievance can at least be excused somewhat since the opposite is also true: that it does not attempt to rush towards an unsatisfying conclusion. Plus, the anime deserves further recognition for the consistent tone in its narrative as well as the frequent-enough action scenes which showcase a cooler side of the show. So, while the story couldn\u2019t quite reach the loftiest of heights, it still pulls along a respectable amount of clout.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nIf Houseki no Kuni should be remembered for anything in the history books, its artistic vision no doubt claims a chapter. For it is not a stretch to denote this anime as a landmark project for the medium regarding the CG approach it daringly takes and the notable execution it ultimately achieves with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe show immediately takes advantage of its near-constant extra dimension with slick camera work. Following perspectives and dynamic shots enable the show to go for tougher angles and more interesting possibilities that are just not as feasible in the normal space anime occupies. Not to mention that the general cinematography for the various scenes allows the CG-ness to flourish.\\n\\n\r\nIt then goes for those extra steps. While regular stuttering in the actual animation reminds the audience of its 3D nature, it has a certain charm in that the anime isn\u2019t afraid to embrace its computerized roots. Nevertheless, very smooth movements are common as Phos and the others engage in skirmishes and play off one another. The flowing of gold and the richness of fur also catch the eye.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it isn\u2019t typifying CG usage, the show still remains a sight to behold. Amazing backdrops not only set the stage for the ensuing battles and the calmer downtime they experience but also add context to the loneliness these characters feel and the wonder that their drive manifests. More to the point, Houseki no Kuni integrates flashes of 2D art (rather than the other way around in traditional shows) for its facial expressions and even particular scenes. It\u2019s often subtle, but this melding affords the anime new options around most corners.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs also deserve praise. Their attire coincides with the genderless state of their beings: casual suits and formal ties during the day; bathrobes before bed at night. However, their hairdos garner the most attention. The styles and the colors vary, and an alluring quality follows them almost everywhere as it bobs on their heads and shimmers on their shoulders to a dazzling degree. A feat realized by its CG strides.\\n\\n\r\nNearly everything coalesces into an incredible display of skill and prowess on an artistic plane. Indeed, this show is now what every other CG-centric anime should most likely look up to and learn from moving forward. And that\u2019s not a shallow statement whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nHouseki no Kuni continues its streak of strong execution with its cast members.\\n\\n\r\nPhos, the main protagonist, is key among this group. They begin as a weak, clumsy, and na\u00efve pebble and evolve into a strong, determined, and inquisitive gemstone. Their extreme changes become emblematic of character development as the journey before them tests their might and their mettle in an almost uncompromising fashion.\\n\\n\r\nTheir personal Ship of Theseus situation modifies their body and their mind, implicitly challenging the concept of identity for another philosophical edge the anime hones. But their heart remains true. Constant failures do not impede their progress but rather instill in them the growth and the maturity they desire. In turn, their setbacks hearken back to that thematic take on self-discovery and guide them towards purpose for both others and their own being.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, Phos feels hapless and ignored and unwanted. So, they find themselves forced to confront their own weaknesses \u2013 known or otherwise \u2013 as a means of displacing their supposed inadequacies and thus quelling any doubts. Sometimes the outcome seems desirable; sometimes the outcome drags a haunting burden.\\n\\n\r\nYet they answer the uncompromising with a refusal to stop. They help. They learn. They mature. While Phos has yet to reach the end of their adventure, they have clearly gotten so far.\\n\\n\r\nPhos alone cannot carry Houseki no Kuni. So, the anime pays attention to its side cast members, ensuring that they as well have a chance to shine. Bort fights as the strongest among them. Alexandrite studies the Lunarians with overexcitement. Sensei oversees his cherished flock with discipline and care. Even fringe characters like Yellow Diamond and Zircon have their own mini-arcs accounted.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there are vital supporting characters, too. Dia battles against jealous inner demons, and Antarcticite acts as a role model for Phos. One could argue that Houseki no Kuni drops the bar with Cinnabar, its next most important character after Phos, due to their lack of screen time. However, their outcast parallels, their contrasting attitude, and their sideline wisdom form a tight relationship between these green and red wonders.\\n\\n\r\nWith the entire crew polished to a refined sheen, it is no wonder that they place the anime ever higher on the pedestal.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe CG is basically the mainstay of the show, but the audio decisions within Houseki no Kuni are no slouch over either.\\n\\n\r\nIts opening track, \u201cKyoumen no Nami\u201d, elicits fascination when plinking piano keys give way to a melody of notes that anchor the song to a forward momentum. The rapid tapping of drums, the bass strings in the background, and the powerful vocals charge up the song with equal parts imagination and sorrow while still maintaining its light, airy ambiance. It all comes together as a vibrant piece that primes the audience for the story that awaits.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the crown jewel, though, rumbles forth from the original soundtrack as ancient moods and mystical atmospheres erupt from a majority of the tracks. Dancing xylophones and somber Asian instrumentation evoke an introspectiveness perfect for the narrative. Piano melodies, sweeping violins, and a rousing wind section quake with an orchestral stomp that captures the whimsical, uplifting, and dramatic parts off the anime. Hand drums increase the frantic tension during those common spats with the Lunarians. The ensemble is simply beautiful and memorable.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cKirameku Hamabe\u201d bookends many of the episodes as the season\u2019s ending track, and it also earns its keep. While not initially as captivating as its OP or OST brethren, this ED grows on the listener with each subsequent listen as the finer details are heard. The blaring trumpets. The crashing cymbals. The rhythmic tambourine. All while moving at a nominal pace the whole time, letting the composition speak for itself. Overlaid with piano and a stoic vocalist, this track soars alongside the rest of the music.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire voice-acting crew does a swell job, too. Tomoyo Kurosawa as Phos nails it best. Not because she must as the lead but because she gives them as much personality as she can muster, capturing their jokey mannerisms, their na\u00efve delivery, and their resolute tone, ranging in feeling and emotion as Phos undergoes their bevy of trials. Ai Kayano as Dia and Jouji Nakata as Sensei also get shoutouts for their performances. The former has a gentleness to her words that soothes the soul, and the latter commands with a low-sounding calm.\\n\\n\r\nSmaller touches, like the clashing of stone-on-stone as the characters run through their marbled abode or the ringing emanated from arrows striking swords, further highlight the attention to detail Houseki no Kuni houses in its audio direction. Combined with everything else in the music and the sound, it\u2019s a powerhouse of mountainous proportions.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s always a pleasure being able to watch a top-tier anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis one had reeled me in from the beginning thanks to Phos. They are force of amusement and intrigue, and they are a constant source of awesome for the entire experience. I like how silly they can be. I\u2019m a fan of their arc. I appreciate their spirit and courage. They have risen high on my list of favorite characters for sure.\\n\\n\r\nI cannot forget about how much fun the other characters bring as well. Dia is lovely and cute with their wholesome kindness and their fondness for fluffiness. Rutile cares mostly for the science of their \u201cpeople\u201d, so their straightforward behavior when it comes to mending the \u201cscars\u201d and checking the \u201cbones\u201d of their comrades gets me chuckling. And Red Beryl frustrated about improper measurements makes me smile with glee.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the fun, many of the dramatic moments are noteworthy, and its engaging, anti-nihilistic vibe forms a taut tether throughout the show. And it\u2019s just inspiring to see. Not only since I\u2019m a computer dude at heart but also since it accomplishes its goal of tearing down the current CG connotations. I view it as one of the first truly phenomenal CG anime, and I can only hope for a continuation sooner rather than later.\\n\\n\r\nUntil then, I sit here content, knowing that this anime has attained stardom already.\\n\\n\r\nHouseki no Kuni surfaces as a fantastic project worth its weight. The philosophy of its themes. The groundbreaking artistry. The fortitude of its cast members. The serene music. The bulk of its entertainment. Any geological timescale will have this anime on its radar indefinitely.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, a very interesting premise, an excellent script, nice dramatic moments, and strong themes are held back by a few awkward narrative decisions\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Great, a CG landmark within this medium\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Phos is emblematic of character development, and supports like Cinnabar, Dia, and Antarcticite contribute to both them and the larger tale being told\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Great, a vibrant OP, a soaring ED, a stellar OST, a bunch of wonderful VA performances, and a set of smart audio design choices cap off the production values with style and finesse\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, Phos is a favorite, lots of fun discovered, filled with intriguing elements, and inspiring to see\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "Beautiful.\r\nIf there's one word that comes to mind while watching Houseki No Kuni, it's simply beautiful. There were multiple points during my viewing of this series where I almost felt moved to tears just by how overwhelmingly beautiful I found it, both visually and story-wise. \r\nThe first thing most people will notice in Houseki No Kuni, and likely the most debated aspect of the series is its animation style, which is almost entirely CGI. And as someone who was previously skeptical of the use of CGI in anime, it makes me very happy to say that the animation was executed exceptionally. Every single shot isjust stunning, with incredibly vibrant colours and mesmerising fluid animation. Not only is it just nice on the eyes, but it feels integral to the storytelling and the characters of the show. What I love about the use of CGI here is just how necessary it feels, in my opinion a show like this couldn't have been made without the use of CGI.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals aside, the part of Houseki No Kuni that left the largest impact on me was the story. I found the anime immediately intriguing from the unique world it creates, but it was the deep character development that made me love this anime as much as I did. Houseki No Kuni is a story about change, wanting to change oneself and how far someone will go to do so. The anime takes you on such an introspective journey through the metaphorical and also quite literal transformation of Phos. It questions philosophical ideas such as what makes someone an individual? If you change every aspect of yourself do you remain the same person? Making the gems immortal beings also allows for interesting exploration into themes of life, death, rebirth and what it means to truly die.\\n\\n\r\nIn the grander scheme of the world Houseki No Kuni is set in, the anime doesn't take it through many significant changes. But I wouldn't consider this a negative, I think the show has major strengths in its subtlety. Like it's amazing opening theme, it takes pride in it's calm and pretty nature, and doesn't attempt to impress you with a triumphant crescendo. Rather than trying to tell a grand story, Houseki no Kuni builds a strange and beautiful world.\\n\\n\r\nThere's much more I could cover, but I think anyone interested enough to read this far should definitely go experience this anime themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe few complaints I have for Houseki No Kuni are minimal, and I highly recommend watching it.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Love it.  The concept kind of reminds me of Gunslinger Girl, i.e. the \"harem of holy fools sequestered in an Eden-like setting\" trope used as a backdrop for existential exploration.  And I mean \"holy fools\" in the most benign sense: innocent and ignorant of sin.  Very much like Prince Mishkin in one of my favorite books every, The Idiot.\r\nBut even if other series have used this idea before, Houseki no Kuni is still very original.  The characters' thoughts and reactions regularly catch me off-guard, there's very little cliche to them.  The story arc moves pretty quickly, and it has agood balance.  It's not too melodramatic (something you could accuse GG of) yet it does have feeling.  This is a serious, contemplative series, but there's a good amount of gentle humor and tastefully, carefully crafted fan service.  There is a also very distinct aesthetic of female beauty at work here...\\n\\n\r\nThe art is incredible, CG enhanced at its best.  It's the kind of series that makes you appreciate what modern technology can do for animation.  Like it really pushes the experience forward.  Love the scenery, it's beautiful, and a couple of the fight scenes now have taken me by surprise.  Not like Attack on Titan level of cool, but surprisingly good.  The main draw though is the beauty and color of the scenery.  It's like a vacation for your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nI give HnK a 9 because it's about as good as you can get without being a classic, and I just don't know yet if it makes it into my pantheon of the best ever.  Have to see how I end up feeling after it's done and if it sticks with me for years.  Probably not, but it's possible.",

            "content": "Very, very different to anything I\u2019ve experienced before. Watching it felt more like watching an RPG\u2019s cinematic sequences than an anime. It was captivating, multi-layered, and so beautifully crafted I was in sheer awe throughout the majority of the show.\r\nThe anime felt strangely tranquil, even throughout its action scenes, even as the mystery was built up. After it was over it left me pondering for quite a while.\r\nThe story was incredibly unique; I was enthralled from the get-go. There was very little context to go on, which matched the character\u2019s lack of understanding about their world perfectly. All we received was a short backstory aboutthe history of their world, which was as original as it was fantastical. Most of the story revolved around getting to know and understand the gems\u2019 way of life and mentalities, with the mystery elements \u2013 what are the lunarians? Why do they really want the gems? What is their relationship to Sensei? \u2013 not being explored until near the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nEach aspect of the Gems\u2019 world was interesting: their different jobs, their home, their hierarchy (which used the hardness and age of each gem to determine their place), and their interactions with the rest of their mainly desolate world. There were some similarities to the way human society works, yet there were far more differences, and this is what made watching it so fascinating. The differences were mainly due to the lifespan of the gems; an immortal views existence differently to those who have death at the end of their road. For an immortal it is all about finding something to give eternity meaning, finding a reason to want to live, and not just exist. Humans have that too, but not to the same extent. \\n\r\nAs the anime compellingly puts it \u2018death takes everything, but in return it gives meaning to life\u2019. A profound quote, and one that made me stop and think about life and death in general. However I didn\u2019t really feel the existential dread one would expect throughout this anime. To the contrary I felt\u2026peaceful. Serene. There were a few cleverly done tense parts in the story, but they didn\u2019t negate the overall tone. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was also perfect, neither too fast nor too slow. I felt there was enough time given to absorb each new detail without feeling either overloaded or bored.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation were phenomenal. The colours were vibrant, with shades of green, blue and pink I\u2019ve never before seen in an anime. And as for the use of CGI, let me put it like this: this anime better be the winner of the best CGI category in the awards this year, because it beats everything else hands down. Each pane was flawless. Even the characters\u2019 hair was a work of art. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was unusual, yet fitting. the op was\u2026jerky, for lack of a better way to describe it. It took some getting used to, but I did come to see how it matched the overall tranquil tone of the series. The ed was very nice; that\u2019s about all I can say about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were loveable. The character with by far the most development was Phos \u2013 as expected from the MC. His/her development, though, was wonderful. Starting out as a virtually helpless, perpetually restless, and irritatingly spoiled child, by the end of the series (s)he had grown to understand the world, to look beyond his/herself and his/her own desires and actually think in a mature way. The transition was smooth; (s)he didn\u2019t change overnight. Rather each event impacted his/her psyche a little more, culminating after a particular incident about two thirds of the way through the series. It was remarkably executed, and evident that the underlying Phos was the same, no matter his/her changes.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters had varying degrees of development. The most intriguing of the secondary characters was probably Antarctictite, whose interactions with Phos contributed to both their developments \u2013 they rubbed off on each other and both came away the better for it. The others were mainly defined by how they contributed to the community \u2013 they were developed more as different features of the community were explored. Diamond, Bort, Cinnabar, Rutile, Jade and King were noteworthy characters, but more because of their role in Phos\u2019 development than on their own merit. Regardless, they were all splendid to watch - Diamond in particular had some superb action scenes that also helped flesh out the story.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: it\u2019s the world-building that wins it for me. That, and the overall tone of the series. I couldn\u2019t find a single reason to give it less than a perfect score except for the sudden ending (I would have liked to see one or two of the burning questions answered). And thus, a perfect score was what I gave it. A work of art that thoroughly deserves its praises. XD\\n\\n\r\nNB: I\u2019d recommend this series to deep thinkers or anyone looking for something new and creative (adults and kids alike). I wouldn\u2019t, however, recommend this series to people looking for a fast-paced comedy with lots of romance, because this story doesn\u2019t have that. (Thankfully it doesn\u2019t have any fanservice either). It\u2019s a fantastical coming of age story, and should be viewed with an open mind. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, go and watch it! I hope you\u2019ll like it just as much as I did. \ud83d\ude0a\\n\\n\r\nP.s. There better be a season two. I could do with some answers.\\n",

            "content": "Land of the Lustrous is a story about gems fighting against moving statues (that appear out of the sky) to prevent them from being turned into jewelry.\r\nWow, that sounded bad huh? Except it sure is not! We follow Phos, the youngest and weakest amongst the gems that inhabit the planet in this story about survival and chemistry, literally and figuratively. \r\nFirst of all, the visuals in this show is top notch! And being CGI, it sure did not distract me from what is going in the screen. I mostly despise CGI because they look like video game cut scenes to me. But this one isa first. And is a good example of how a CGI anime should be done. It also helps to show the characters properly, them being gems and all that.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was great too. That scene when Dia runs back home after learning something important about snails highlighted the art and sound of the show. You know that scene!\\n\\n\r\nAside from our MC Phos, we have a plethora of characters and almost all of them have sufficient development that it is impossible not to find one to relate with. Bort, the diamond-class expert combatant. Cinnabar, the recluse nights watch (not related to Jon Snow). Dia, the sweet jewel and Bort's partner. Rutile, the proficient medic. Yellow Diamond, the oldest and the fastest. Antarcticite, the winter soldier (no metal arm tho). Heck, even Padparadscha, who only shows up for about 20 seconds, is interesting as hell!\\n\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed this show a lot. More than Made in Abyss, which was an amazing show as well! I am not going to read the manga because I am so looking forward to the next season and I want to watch it without any more knowledge that what the show has given me.\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommended. Some say that this show is kind of a drag but the show went by quickly to me. Very well paced and each episode gave us something new.",

            "content": "Land of the Lustrous was one of the most well-executed fantasy series of this year. Beside Made in Abyss, I can safely say it was quite a fantasy series. Some fantasy series this year had the premise, but they did not have a proper world-building. However, these two that I have just cited are an exception. The premise of anthropomorphic jewelry in a post-apocalyptic world and the physical and spiritual consequences that led to this state is something truly unheard of for me. Each character is relatable, his little bows are always loaded with emotions causing each character to be valued.\r\nA mixture of melancholy, humor,among other things, made this series an incredible journey. The fact that we get caught up in the story every week and the way it was being executed is something that deserves attention. Anyway, Land of the Lustrous is literally a jewel of the season, and the year. Recommend [if you have good will] to anyone you meet; I'm sure the person will not regret it.",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Housouki no Kuni and while care has been taken to minimise spoilers there may still be some present in character analysis. \r\nIntro and premise \r\nOne gems journey to become a capable warrior to protect her friends\r\nBased off a popular manga of the same name Housouki no Kuni also known as Land of the Lustrous is an action fantasy anime that common to animes of this genre has a large-scale fight as its main premise. Taking place in the near future where a new form of life that unlike normal humansare gender less and immortal called Gems live upon the earth. The gems of which there are 28 in total must not only struggle with living their lives on the planet but also contend with defending themselves from a hostile race that dwells on the moon that regularly invades hoping to capture them and turn them into decorations. In this fight for survival, each member of the gems is given specific roles to play in the fight whether acting as recon, warriors, medics and scouts all will have a role to play in this battle for survival. Although the premise of large-scale battles between races is a common enough theme within action anime I felt that the struggle between the gems and the Moon dwellers were unique in that rather than mere destruction the gems were fighting hard to stop the moon dwellers from taking them and transforming them into ornaments which I felt was a fate worse than death. \\n\\n\r\nTaking place in an alternate version of earth where humanity become extinct the overall story of the series while showing the battles that make up the war that\u2019s being waged between the Gems and the Moon Dwellers also looks at the development and gradual evolution of the character of Phos a relatively weak gem that aspires to be useful to her friends and allies and fight on the battlefield alongside them and her gradual evolution as the war between the two races intensify. \\n\\n\r\nPhosphophyllite \\n\\n\r\nPhosphophyllite voiced by veteran seiyuu Tomoyo Kurosawa of Black Bullet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A member of the gem race and the youngest of their number Phosphophyllite in the beginning of the series was a calm, confident, positive and eager person and was someone that was keen to enter the battlefield and find a role for herself in the fight against the moon dwellers. However, due to the fragility of her mineral namesake, this hope of her was dashed time after time causing her to be saddled with lighter duties while the others fought. Though Pho\u2019s tries to blow this off with her positive attitude this is something that she detests greatly. True to her positive nature Phosphophyllite who is more commonly known as Phos by others is a cheerful person by nature and is kind and caring to everyone that she meets and as a result of her desire to help is someone that\u2019s always eager to help others even if it places her in harms way showing her strong determination. While lively and happy for the most part it can be seen that Phos is someone that gets bored quite easily which often leads to her throwing one of her tantrums in which she tries to get others to assign better tasks for her. In the beginning of the series, it can be seen that due to her fragility which limits the roles that she can be given on the field that Phos was viewed somewhat with disdain by some members of her fellow gems who see her as useless to their war effort. While understanding this Phos still tries to remain positive and lively playing the joker and still trying to help showing her strong desire to help her fellows in the war. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on Phos personality gradually changes as a result of not just the war itself changing but also because of the tasks that she has set herself to do. In the beginning of the series as a result of her fragility which meant that she was only given light duties, Phos notably had a lot of free time on her hands which allowed her to explore the area around the school and get to know the terrain around it relatively easily. As a result of this Phos was given the opportunity to encounter many interesting lifeforms that existed in the surrounding area and understand what life is and what makes life unique. As a result of this Phos was also able to determine that while she was too fragile to be of much use on the battlefield she was at least capable of helping others with solving their problems a realisation that really improved her mood and personality as for the first time it imbued in her a sense that she can be useful to others at last. This new realisation of hers causes Phos to become more determined to help her friends and in doing so overcome the fear that she feels when being near the moon dwellers. Arguably the most significant change of Phos personality came about during the winter period which resulted in her not only gaining new legs but also arms as well though at great cost due to the loss of a valued comrade. In the aftermath of this loss, Phos personality changes substantially becoming braver and more composed and more willing to stand on the front line. At the same time, however, Phos notably becomes more quiet and sullen that replaces her positive and cheerful nature. While Phos personality before was a tad on the reckless side after gaining the new limbs, she becomes less reckless and instead more cautious and willing to use her improved perception skills to determine the best chance to intervene. On the psychological level, it can be seen that in light of her friend\u2019s death that Phos is now more dutiful and determined in order to honor her friend\u2019s memory. The character of Phos I felt was an interesting one that was not only well designed but also well developed. While she was someone that lacked a real purpose, in the beginning, her gradual development as the series went on from someone that got scared easily to someone that can face a whole group of moon dwellers by herself was a change that I thought was well executed. I felt that her seiyuu Tomoyo Kurosawa really did an excellent job in portraying the character of Phos. \\n\\n\r\nCinnabar \\n\\n\r\nCinnabar voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Mikako Komatsu of Re Creators and Tales of Zestiria the X fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is a fellow gem of Phos. A somewhat gloomy gem that is also dutiful and serious Cinnabar is a bit of an enigma within the gems in that due to her condition she is unable to be near her fellow gems and as a result, while she can be relied upon to fulfil her duties as night watchman she can only do so by herself. As a result of this, it's perhaps unsurprising that Cinnabar prefers solitude and doesn\u2019t want others to see her at all. Despite the pain that she obviously feels it can be seen that Cinnabar is conscious of her duty and still regards her fellow gems with respect and kindness and was, in fact, the one who advocated for the duty in the first place as it will allow her to protect them while at the same time minimising the threat her curse brings to them. Despite this duty, however, Cinnabar is also conscious of the damage that her curse can do to the surrounding areas and as a result dislikes fighting as this will cause it to unleash. As a result of the curse and the damage that it can do to the surrounding areas, in the beginning, Cinnabar saw herself as someone that was useless and indeed hoped that one day she too will be taken so that her misery will be dealt with. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it can be seen that as a result of meeting with Phos and interacting with her Cinnabar\u2019s personality gradually changes as a result of this becoming much more talkative and willing to express her own feelings and willing to help others that need help instead of wallowing in despair. It can also be seen that Cinnabar was affected a great deal by Phos determined attempts to help her find a way to nullify her poison as doing so also puts her life being put in danger as well. \\n\\n\r\nDiamond \\n\\n\r\nDiamond voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Tales of Zestiria the X and 3 Gatsu no Lion fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is a fellow gem of Phos. A member of the Diamond class of gems like her teammate and friend Bort Diamond who likes to be called Dia is a quiet, soft-spoken, kind and positive person by nature. A kind-hearted and understanding person that\u2019s also compassionate to a fault Dia is someone that cares deeply about everyone whether they are her friends or just acquaintances and will always try to help others with their troubles no matter how troublesome it is. As a result of her helpful, calm and compassionate nature Dia is someone that can be seen to be easily approachable by many people including Phos if they want to get something off their chest and as a result, Dia can often be seen as having the role of a listener as well. Complimenting this role of Dia is the fact that she also has a funny and curious side to her that reveals itself when she encounters beings or situations that she has not encountered before.  A prominent trait of Dia is her persistent nature in that once she sets her sights on something she will not stop until she succeeds which for her means that she will keep talking to people until they relent and tell her what troubles them. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Dia\u2019s personality becomes more visible it becomes apparent that despite her cheerful and positive nature that Dia is someone that works hard to overcome her classes inherent weakness of being fragile and that she is someone that while grateful for Bort\u2019s protection doesn\u2019t want to keep relying on him. As a result of this Dia\u2019s true self can be seen to have very low self-esteem and constantly tries to be useful to Bort. As a result of seeing Pho\u2019s evolution, Dia starts to realise just how much she had relied on Bort in their battles together and starts to gradually get braver, more independent and stronger in an effort to stand at Bort\u2019s side as an equal rather than as a liability. It can be seen however that her relationship with Bort despite saying otherwise is a deep one and that she see\u2019s being his partner a role that\u2019s important to her. The character of Diamond I felt was an interesting character that was well developed and designed. In particular, the contrast between her public face that she presents to her fellow gems and her inner self that reflected her true struggle I felt was well done. I felt that her seiyuu Ai Kayano really did an excellent job in portraying the character of Diamond. \\n\\n\r\nBort \\n\\n\r\nBort voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayane Sakura of Charlotte and Dragonar Academy fame is one of the main support characters of the series and is a fellow gem of Phos. A member of the Diamond class and Dia\u2019s partner Bort is a quiet, calm and composed person by nature that prefers to keep to himself for the most part. In contrast to his partner, Dia Bort is someone that speaks little and treats his fellow gems with a gruff manner and indeed tries to keep personal relations like friendship to a minimum. Though widely regarded by the others as the strongest of their number in terms of martial might Bort is widely seen by others as someone that was brooding and hard to get close to and indeed the only person that is close to him is his partner Dia. In terms of core values and beliefs, Bort is someone that takes his role as a warrior pretty seriously and indeed seems to have taken the role to heart as well as he believes that strength is very important to him and that without it you are nothing. While Bort does look down on people that lack strength it can also be seen that Bort is also someone that respects people that have strength and is willing to teach them to better use it if he deems it necessary. While gruff towards others Bort does care a great deal about his partner Dia far more than his attitude actually suggests and that the reason that he wants to keep getting stronger is because in addition to fulfilling his duties he  also wants to protect her well-being. As such despite his attitude towards her Bort\u2019s one true wish can be seen to be Dia choosing to leave the battlefield so that she can be safe while he protects her. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise I felt that the animations for the combat scenes as well as the environments were pretty well done and were pretty sharp and clear. The series also had a good variety of environments that did a great job of showing what the different regions of the Earth were like. The combat scenes in addition to being well animated were also well designed and interesting to see. The character designs for the cast I felt was done pretty well as it ensured that character was unique and each of the models I felt was beautiful and elegant. The designs of the enemies that the cast faced in the series I felt was pretty good and evoked the image of actually fighting a god pretty well which was due largely to the designs of the enemies. The designs of the enemies also notably got more elaborate as the series went on which in the story highlighted the fact that the enemy was getting even more serious as well. In terms of music, I felt that the opening and ending themes were both excellent and did a great job of conveying the mood of the series. The background music for the series I felt was also pretty good. In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series had a very capable voice cast that did an excellent job of portraying the series many characters. In particular, I felt that Tomoyo Kurosawa, Ai Kayano and Ayane Sakura who portrayed the characters of Phos, Diamond and Bort respectively did an excellent job in portraying their assigned characters. While I didn\u2019t cover her role in this review I felt that veteran seiyuu Chiwa Saito also did an excellent job of portraying the character of Ventricosus. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nOverall Housouki no Kuni was an excellent anime that had among its main strong points its interesting premise, excellent story, great characters and excellent combat scenes. The main premise of the series is of course the struggle between the Moon Dwellers who want to turn the gems into ornaments and the gems struggle to defend themselves and stop that from happening. While the main premise of the series is the war between the two races the series also introduces a number of themes that serve to enhance the members of the gems and defy them as unique lifeforms rather than as mere prey that the Moon Dwellers see them as. These include the duty to protect their fellow gems by assisting the front line in whatever role they can best be of use in and loyalty to both their fellow gems and to the cause. These themes I felt did a great job of enhancing the personalities of the individual characters as it made them more grounded and gave each a defined purpose in this war. The series overall story I felt was pretty strong and while it looked at the war from an overall perspective it also did a great job at highlighting the struggles that each of the gems experienced as they fought in it particularly with regards to Pho\u2019s struggle to become strong and useful to her friends and the sorrows and despairs that she experienced in her journey to become strong and be of more use to her friends and allies. The lore within the series especially with regards to the moon dwellers while not coming into play until the latter part of the series I felt was intriguing and helped a lot in defining the world\u2019s races and the relationship between them.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall Housouki no Kuni was an anime that I enjoyed a lot in that it had an interesting premise, story, characters and well designed and executed combat scenes. I do feel however that the series had too many characters in it and that as a result not all were given enough roles to make them stand out. In terms of final score, I would say that the series would deserve a score of 9/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A distant, but promising future.\r\nHouseki no Kuni. An anime which is set in a far future where humans no longer exist as one race, but as many different races. Some of these races live in the seas, and some live on the moon. Only one race of \"human\" still lives on land, they're called \"gems.\" And they are a sentient group of rare gems, literally, which have taken on the form of humans. However they are being hunted by the people of the moon, which are respectably called \"Lunarians.\" They want to use the gems as their cosmetics or tools. And for thousands of yearsthe gems have been in a constant \"war\" against the Lunarians. Our protagonist, Phosphophyllite, or \"Phos\" is one of the youngest gems. And this is where her story follows as she tries to find her place in this world.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I've never quite seen an anime that was animated in 3D and 2D at the same time. It's quite a beauty to behold, specially in 60fps. The OST here is also amazing. And the OP is really, really good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd say this anime was amazing. It started out a bit confusing but slowly started making sense as the story progressed. I have to be honest too, this anime did a great job with it's pacing and utilizing only 12 episodes. I highly recommend you watch this if you like mystery, action type anime.",

            "content": "- - - [Land of the Lustrous : Review] - - -\r\n- [Intro] -\r\nEvery so often there comes an anime that reminds me why I love this medium so much. The creative potential of animation is absolutely astounding. The types of stories you can tell are practically limitless, and I love seeing works that take full advantage of the medium that they're in to create something that couldn't work as well anywhere else. In a period when I was starting to feel fatigued by the same old formulaic series, Land of the Lustrous came along to wake me up.\r\n- [Story] -\r\nFirst of all, the storytellingin this show is really something else. It admittedly starts out a bit slowly, but that's to be expected from a Fantasy series, seeing as they need to take their time to lull you into this unfamiliar world and how it works. Being only 12 episodes it does a fantastic job at giving you a feel for the circumstances of this universe and the characters that inhabit it, and provides just enough information for you to understand whats going on yet still be yearning to know more. The pacing is quite excellent, as plot points appear very often, and by the time they are resolved a new one has already arisen to keep you engaged. Of course, this is not a complete story, so the Season ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, but there is a certain level of closure, per say. From the beginning, there's a clear underlying emphasis on the relationship between Phos and Cinnabar, and the promise that Phos makes very early on. (I cite the visuals of the ED as evidence) This comes full circle by the final episode, giving us at least some sense of \"completion\" while still leaving the big mysteries for a future season. \\n\\n\r\n- [Art / Animation] -\\n\\n\r\nYes, this is a CGI animated show. Yes, many people have claimed that the CG is really good. Sorry for not being a contrarian, but I have to concur. If you have any hangups about CGI in anime, please put them aside, because the usage of it here is absolutely spectacular. It may be very jarring at first, and it definitely was for me, but when you get accustomed to it I think the style works really well, and they manage to accomplish feats that are simply not possible in traditional cel animation. To put it into perspective, what 2D animation generally aims to achieve is fluidity. The quality of animation is generally gauged by how smooth and detailed it is, with the artstyle obviously having an impact as well. In the case of 3D animation, however, making everything move smoothly is quite easy, considering that they are working with pre-built models that do not need to be drawn in every single frame. What it rather attempts to excel at is making it look \"natural.\" The biggest reason most CG anime look so bad is because many of the movements don't look natural, and you feel like you're watching a bunch of robots waltz around on the screen as opposed to actual people. In this case, the characters aren't actual people, yet ironically they move and act as if they were. The blend of 2D and 3D animation is really something else. I have yet to even touch on the action scenes. They take advantage of the CG environments to pull of some seriously breathtaking fight scenes. The way the characters bound across the screen with the camera moving in an impossibly dynamic fashion sounds like it would be confusing and hard to follow, however it is executed in this case with extreme elegance. The action is always clear-cut and beautiful, just like the rest of this show.\\n\\n\r\n- [Sound] -\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really something else. The tracks give off such a sense of surrealism and otherworldlyness. The originality and beauty of some of these tracks really enhance the more climatic and emotional moments. That's not even mentioning the fantastic OP and ED which are phenomenal both visually and musically. The voice acting is also just as excellent, with Phos being a particular standout. The way her VA is able to perfectly convey every single intricacy of her character's emotion with nothing more than her tone of voice is actually pretty amazing. The amount of personality in even just the small little noises she makes has resulted in compilations of \"Phos Noises\" videos. Overall, the sound in this series is, in every department, amazing.\\n\\n\r\n- [Character] -\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters, there's quite a large cast, though Phos easily takes the biggest focus as the main character. The level of growth and progression she recieves in just a 12 episode runtime, not to mention while simultaneously balancing the involvement of story elements and other characters appearing is pretty insane. You truly feel that she has come a long way from the wide-eyed, playful character she was at the start. This is true to such a degree that her character is almost unrecognizable, and it doesn't feel forced at all. I've seen 26 episode series miserably fail to achieve this with their main characters, so it's impressive to see it done so well here. Regarding the rest of the cast, they're all pretty great in their own right. Only a few other characters get much in the way of depth, but the little that is spread around is delivered pretty well, and the entire supporting cast is always a delight to watch, as every character is very distinct and entertaining in their own way.\\n\\n\r\n- [Conclusion] -\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I absolutely loved this series. It's such a breath of fresh air compared to much of what has been coming out recently. It's just so refreshing to see something with this much originality and care put into it. Everything from the interesting worldbuilding, the lovable characters, the exciting story, the beautiful music, and the dynamic animation add up to make Land of the Lustrous one of my favorite series in recent memory.",

            "content": "Revolutionary and a breath of fresh air in some aspects. So woefully incomplete and under developed in other areas. This anime is far from complete. One would need at least 60 episodes in order to fully flesh out the world and all of the characters within it while maintaining the nice pacing the series does have. This 12 episode \u201cseason\u201d is the equivalent of combining a few monogatari arcs together to develop one characters background (as well as the world)  within the frame of a larger story. The unique, revolutionary, and fully developed style is something I havn\u2019t seen since Puella Madoka Magica. Praiseall around but by god if they dont announce seasons 2-8 soon I will have blood. Other than the incompleteness the only other complaint I have is that there is a sort of unprecedented and obvious shift in the final fourth of the series, everything picks up from the animation to the action and the humor, it almost felt like a different show. Also the ending does not wrap it up nicely it is a cliff hanger.",

            "content": "Who says that 3D CGI is dead...\r\nHouseki no Kuni is some of the few promising fully 3D CGI animes that lives up to it's CGI work, sure almost every work from Polygon Pictures and the few from SANZIGEN in LA's point of view has also done it, but Houseki no Kuni undoubtedly made waves in it's incorporation with it's 3D CGI to beautiful and fluid degrees. \r\nLA already raving on it's CGI, Houseki no Kuni's plot is also nicely blending in both it's character development and evolution with it's interesting world building that Houseki no Kuni's world is placed in, that of a world wherecrystallized humanoid beings called Gems inhabit the world whilst Lunarians \"break\" those Gems. Phosphophyllite or Phos voiced by Tomoyo Kurosawa is a fragile Gem where she encounters Cinnabar voiced by Mikako Komatsu and makes it her goal to find a job better than the night watch for her, as Cinnabar being a substance made of mercury making her a self-made loner due to her toxic substances around her.\\n\\n\r\nHouseki no Kuni explores both it's mysterious world as well the character development of the Gems in the process be it relational issues to character evolutions mainly coming from Phos but all those characters and plot lurks a secret...\\n\\n\r\nLA will say this at the very least, as much as Phos early on is a nuisance and careless dreamer due to Phos' fragility as a Gem, Phos gets some of the best development in the series being the main character and all and this comes in the form of something unexpected that just utterly shatters Phos' perspective of the world Phos is in, changing Phos into a more headstrong and stoic yet having bouts of existential crisis about the situation and events that latter befalls Phos and those around Phos that you can't help but sympathize with Phos and see how much Phos has grown for the better or worse. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the rest of the cast, they have their own quirks here and there as typical of an ensemble cast, from Bort voiced by Ayane Sakura as the utterly stoic badass with little emotions, Alexandrite voiced by Rie Kugimiya, the Lunarian fanatic, Jade voiced by Ayahi Takagaki the tsundere and Rutile voiced by Yumi Uchiyama the doctor of the Gems but has a penchant for dissecting things and LA's favourite Gem Diamond voiced by Ai Kayano, probably the only Gem that stood by Phos early on and all of Phos' hijinks good or bad. For the characters themselves, they have a sense of relevance as the plot needs them to, comedic relief or not, but in the case of actual plot relevance, then Cinnabar, Bort, Diamond, Rutile and Sensei voiced by Joji Nakata, the Gem's Master and the only human character to have the most plot significance. \\n\\n\r\nNow as for the world building in Houseki no Kuni, thta comes in the form of Phos exploring the world and the plot subtlety tells of these world building elements from the smallest such as how Gems are born to larger more interesting ones  mainly of the belief of the three species of \"flesh, bone and soul\", \"flesh\" being the Admirabilis representing the wildlife but in it's most early life form...like...slugs but could also represent the sea, \"bone\" being the Gems themselves but could also represent land and the \"soul\" which are the Lunarians but also \"skies\". Phos befriends all three of them and though little hints about the world are told through exposition from other Gems, LA's most interesting element of Houseki no Kuni's world building is that of the \"flesh, bone and soul\" and what this has to do with Sensei...nonetheless world building was done spectacularly and \"almost' seamlessly and made LA engross into it's world like world building is suppose to.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, done by Orange as LA aforementioned utilizes it's 3D CGI in such detail and precision that it's seamless and fluid at the same time, the 3D CGI that even lends itself to with it's battles are just amazingly done, from the simple shine of the Gems, to the quick fluid battles of the Lunarians and the Gems are just amazingly done. From the simple backgrounds to the great 3D CGI work on the Gems that almost makes the Gems look like Gems as they shine and sparkle to heck even getting FUR done well, LA can't praise the 3D CGI work that Orange has done enough and the great attention to detail in utilizing it's 3D CGI to it's fullest potential.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is no slouch either gathering a variety of veteran and well known voice actors, from Rie Kugimiya, Mikako Komatsu, Kanae Ito, Ayane Sakura, Ai Kayano, Joji Nakata, Mariya Ise, Yumi Uchiyama, Saori Hayami, Maaya Uchida, Mamiko Noto, Ayahi Takagaki, Romi Park, Chiwa Saito and Tomoyo Kurosawa as the main protagonist Phos and ohh boy does LA need to priase the ever living heck out of Tomoyo Kurosawa's performance as Phos as she did an AMAZING job as Phos, from the energetic but naive to the stern and serious all with her own little quirks about her that just made Phos Phos. If there was an MVP to Houseki no Kuni's voice work then it easily goes to Tomoyo Kurosawa...with Ai Kayano following in second.\\n\\n\r\nWith all the amazing praise LA is giving Houseki no Kuni, is there any flaws to Houseki no Kuni itself?, well if LA HAD to nitpick then it would be that if you don't like some of the Gems especially when it comes to Phos, Bort and maybe Diamond then it could be a problem, especially with how Phos just brings misfortune every time Phos does something but that defense can be settled from Phos' character evolution but that doesn't kick in until almost past halfway through the anime. Bort and Diamond is a different situation altogether and more or less picking sides and LA will be unbiased and leave it at that. The only other thing would be that Houseki no Kuni itself leaves itself open to a \"read the manga\" style ending giving us huge plot points still not told with that secret only growing larger and larger, so yeah the finale is your typical \"read the manga\" ending but LA wouldn't say that utterly defects the anime as a whole in this case as the ride in Houseki no Kuni's world and it's characters were a great experience and sure a non conclusive ending is annoying but nonetheless...\\n\\n\r\nHouseki no Kuni is another 3D CGI anime that shows off what 3D CGI can really do and gives us it in beautiful spades and Houseki no Kuni did just that, sure Houseki no Kuni's characters might give discourse but that of good kind but even with that, the anime's world building and it's character evolution of Phos as a character made Houseki no Kuni something definitely solid as an anime (no pun intended) even if it gives us a non conclusive ending, it's one of those anime that LA can say to ignore the \"ending is paramount\" even though LA WANTS to know more after watching the finale. \\n\\n\r\nHouseki no Kuni is a shining beacon to what an anime done in fully 3D CGI can be done to it's fullest potential and what it's capable of...",

Also for those who think this show is similar to Steven Universe, you are completely wrong, please totally remove your preconception that this was a copy but tbh this story was written prior to it (manga).\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is weird and everything looks as if you were watching a partially edited CGI, but after 2nd episode, you will start loving it ( cos I am a person who hates animation made by shaft but loved this). The fights are badass and everything looks artistic and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtracks are the key role in this anime as it was the main thing which captured my attention and it acted like a blanket covering all the flaws in animations and story. The op song is really soothing and peaceful.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the show looks as if It moves at a faster pace but there is a very little story but It teaches some life improving topics like \"coming out of your shell or lies\" but also making you think about what lies ahead if you leave this 'lie' (which many anime fail to do)\\n\\n\r\nMy advice to everyone is to give a shot, watch 2 episodes and if you hate it then drop, but I am sure this is definitely one of those shows which is worth watching once in a lifetime without any regret. \\n\r\nAnd since the story is still in starting phase with not much revealed, I guess only this season is worth the watch cos some story are worth for their potential but can't be handled for a long time as it might get boring or maybe you just want to live in that 'lie' of yours perhaps :P\\n",

            "content": "When I first saw the announcement for this anime, I thought it wouldn't do well since pretty much every other CGI anime has a low rating and is poorly done. However, I decided to give it a try, mainly due to the fact that I'm a sucker for vivid colors and high contrast as well as the fact I just really like gemstones.\r\nI came into the start of the first episode expecting to drop it after a couple of minutes, however that minute turned into several and I ended up finishing the whole episode ready for next week to come. Houseki no Kuni does aphenomenal job at pulling you in and keeping you interested for the entirety of an episode, every episode; something that many other anime fail to do.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very interesting and one that gives you many questions to think about as you progress through the anime. The one thing that made this story more exciting for me was the fact that there were several times where an event happened that I did not see coming. Too many anime today are oh so very predictable and leave you bored, but Houseki no Kuni? There's twists and development that I never could have guessed even with years of experience watching a variety of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds and characters are all simple yet unique at the same time. Every scene shown is done to the fullest with a high quality animation. The fight scenes are fast paced showing several perspectives as you watch the character whip around the enemy and attack with such grace, something that you would never expect to see with CGI. Even with the large quantity of characters, each one has their own unique personality and quirks that make them seem so real rather than just a boring supporting character that caters to the main character. The music too fits very well with each scene done and the mood each character makes for the scene.\\n\\n\r\nI can honestly say that this anime is by far one of my favorites from this past year and really is a hidden gem. I still remember when the PV's came out and hardly anyone was interested in it and yet today it's here with an 8.48 rating ranked by more than 12,500 users. I really hope for a season 2 because this anime deserves so much for the effort it was given by it's creators. PLEASE, give this anime a shot. Turning it down because it's a CGI anime before even seeing what they have to offer is a huge mistake.",

            "content": "There hasn't been an instance to date where I have ever been pleased or impressed with the use of CGI in any fashion in anime. That isn't to say that I hate CGI. I don't. I genuinely want it to succeed and blow me away, as I feel that in many regards it is becoming the future of the medium. There are no instances where I have been impressed with CGI. \r\nUntil I watched this show.\r\nHouseki No Kuni is nothing short of breathtaking. The art and animation were as vibrant as the gems that were their subject. I can go on for ages abouthow beautiful everything about the visuals of this show is, and I will: The endless sweeping plains of green that lock you into this state of mindless comfort, The stunning sunsets and sunrises that utilized so many shades of orange and red, that It felt like I was looking at a bunch of Home Depot paint swatches (in a good way), the way light penetrates in elegant rays onto the ocean floor, the way that light bounces off of the surface of water, the way light shimmers and dances off of the Gem's eyes and hair, the rolling hills, the steep cliffs, the kaleidoscopic shapes that signified the Lunarian's arrival, The vast cloudless skies, the speckled cloudy skies and the way the shadows of clouds shaped the atmosphere below, the still and grey winter that somehow had its own unique sense of vibrancy, the cool blues of the Ice floes...\\n\\n\r\nI really could just keep going. The show was candy to look at, and the CGI actually accentuated it. I actually don't think this show could have been made UNLESS it was with CGI. The CGI was so good, that imagining this show with conventional animation actually makes me angry. This show will redefine how anime works. As far as I know, there is no other instance yet of CGI working this well. There may be shows here and there where it is passable, but Houseki No Kuni blows traditionally animated series out of the fucking water.\\n\\n\r\nIt was not just art and color that made this show exceptional to look at, it was also direction. CGI allowed for camera techniques that aren't possible in typical anime. I came into this show expecting to feel comfy at best. I did not expect to see some of the best fight choreography and animation that I have seen in a series to date. Some of the fight scenes in Houseki no Kuni made some hunter x hunter fights look like a 4-year-old's ballet recital in comparison and that's my all time favorite Shounen I'm talking about. The way HnK was able to use camera tracking and shot composition to instill such tension and excitement in me was a dormant reaction that I forgot I could have that was stimulated once more for me. It reminded me of the artistry that exists with how you frame a story. There were some moments in this show that were impactful when you just take the words on the page. However, when you add in the nuanced direction in which the show chose to visualize this information it feels like a fucking bomb was dropped on you nut sack.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I'm done stroking off HnK for it's exceptional animation in spite of a community that despises CGI. I want to talk about body language. The way the characters moved was so expressive and natural even though they were gems. There are some gestures and reactions in this show that I see in every fucking anime ever. I'm assuming it's a cultural thing. Things like waving both hands to express a misunderstanding, bowing to people, moodily standing with your back to someone while your head is still pointed in their direction, walking passively with your hands on your head. Little things like this that I see in a bunch of anime have never read or made any sense to me. For some reason, in HnK I finally understood the intentions behind these psychological gestures. After years of watching this shit, HnK, finally helped me understand the intention behind these different physical gags that have always gone completely over my head and that I had always written off as stylistic flare.\\n\\n\r\nI would be remiss if I only mentioned how much I appreciated the art of this show. I wouldn't be this passionate about an anime if I was only impressed with how well it presented itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe character's were great. Let's just jump right into MC, Phos. A big complaint I saw of her was that she was overly-bombastic and the perception was that she was an annoying MC. To be honest, her (Their?) childlike personality always made sense to me, seeing as she is the youngest of the gems. I also think that making her a little over zealous was better than making her boring and flat. I don't see the story being as compelling if Phos were any other way. It is because of Phos' nature that we got such interesting story conflict. Phos had to be the way she was for the story to move at an appropriate speed. I think this is a big reason why her character grew on so many as the series progressed as well. She made shit happen and went after what she wanted. The fact that she grew on the viewer made her dramatic shift in character and coming of age, I guess we'll call it, so much more impactful. Without getting into to many details, Phos experiences something in the series that matures her to a place she wanted to be at the very start of the series both physically and mentally. Beyond this, the way Phos interacts with the rest of the gems from the beginning to the end feels very fleshed and serves to spotlight and specify different gems personalities and inner wants at a natural pace throughout the course of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe mystery and intrigue of this world is something that will draw you the fuck in. There are bits and pieces of details dropped throughout the course of the series that only serve to make you more curious about the origins of the gems (why are there two moons?!). You will get nowhere near all of the answers to your questions but you will become even more intrigued and invested in the series as little snippets are dropped here and there. The implications to some of these little bits are so significant that in some cases, it shifts your entire perspective and opinions on certain characters. Which I think is feat to achieve from a writing perspective.\\n\\n\r\nMy conclusion is: I think this show is a gem. (HA!)\\n\\n\r\nNo, but seriously. This season had a couple of excellent shows and this one for me is AOTS. I was positive that nothing this year would top what Made in Abyss was for me but after watching this show I'm really having to consider what it is I value most in my anime. I would give this show a 10, however, it leaves us on a cliffhanger and a half/assed solution to the conflict that started Phos' journey. I think that the show ended as well as it could have while assuming it wouldn't get a second season, so I understand.\\n\\n\r\n9/10",

The visuals were marvelous but the story aided in the show's success.\r\nThe quote, \"You are perfect the way you are\", is perfect for this show. Phos, a bright, cheerful gem, starts off as naive, innocent, and wanting to become \"useful\" to others. Throughout the story, Phos constantly undergoes changes in his physical and mental state and ultimately becomes one of the strongest fighters amongst the gems. He gains respect from others, but atthe same time, he loses a part of himself. In the last episode, he looks at his past and wishes that he could go back to the days where he was fooling around, not knowing the secrets of the world.\\n\\n\r\nI really loved the writing in this story and it was thanks to the abounding dynamic characters in the story.

            "content": "Land of the lustrous is unique and you should watch it because it is unique.\r\nStory: Its not particularly bland but not very dull. It pretty much reminds me of a more vibrantly colored and less ambitious version of Shinsekai Yori (which is an absolute masterpiece). The dynamic of the characters are interesting and the story is just likeable, or I guess it somehow made a critic who cares so much about a story pay less attention to it? Its not average so it must be above a 5 but it's not good enough for me to call it an 8 so I will settle forjust a GOOD (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt: CG animation is not only employed well, but it ENHANCES the art style and ambiance. Every sheen and every RWBY-esque movement patterns matches well with the series. Not a lot to say here but to say its great. At first I thought it was bad, and then I actually watched the show and realized its pretty good. Although it sometimes slips up, its an overall GREAT (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound: Does not really have any standout OSTs, but they do their job. The ending fits, does its job, and the opening theme is good. I don't know what to say but I guess ACTUALLY FITTING is rarer than one may think so its above the average 5. None of it really adds so I reluctantly give a (6/10).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Every character is likeable, even that monk. Their voice actors all nailed their parts, and the voices of some characters that show up later (not saying their names because of spoilers) have incredible voices in particular. I remember each and every gem person and although they have the same figure, they are suprisingly distinct. I love how each of their designs are so similar (literally the same body shape) but their faces and personalities make them SO DIFFERENT and UNIQUE. (9/10).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I liked the show enough to not study for my test for it. The only reason why its not a higher score is because the ending is somewhat anticlimatic, in a good way though. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you miss ACTUAL CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT and ACTUALLY SINCERE AND NOT SEXUAL DESIGNS and miss ACTUAL PLOT, then you should watch Houseki no Kuni. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. This series is by far the least appreciated anime of 2017. In my opnion, it beats Made in Abyss and triumphs over all that other shit. You are doing yourself a service watching this show.",

            "content": "SPOILER-FREE REVIEW \r\nHouseki no Kuni (Eng: Land of the Lustrous) is a series that takes place in a world where our main characters, based on a variety of jewels/gems, are fighting angel-like enemies known as the Moon People who pursue the gems simply for collective purposes. The story follow Phosphophyllite, commonly referred as Phos, a fragile yet lustrous Jewel that hopes to be as strong as their peers so they can fight off their enemies as well.\r\nIt's a unique anime with its own lore and a well written protagonist. While the main character has great character development, I feel like some of the other charactersare a bit underdeveloped. That being said, I feel like most of the characters all have their own unique quirks and characterization that makes them a bit more appealing than your generic anime.  I just wish we got a little bit more from them, and not just the main character. I also like the fact that the series addresses the fact that these are gems and not humans, so they use gender-neutral pronouns like they/them.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, I think it might be one of the best computer-generated (CGI) anime I've seen. It has an interesting mix of hand-drawn backgrounds and 3D characters that just works really well. Some people get turned away when they hear of a 3D anime but it's really not that bad. The colors are bright and just really fit the tone of the story. The soundtrack is amazing as well. The songs aren't those generic, overused ones you hear in most anime; instead, it's more classical and it fits the tone of the anime well.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm gonna get this out of the way since this is probably my biggest gripe with this anime. The general plot is simple yet very compelling; HOWEVER, there's no clearly-defined goal in the series. There's some major arcs, but we don't really know the purpose of anything that's really going on in the series. They hint a bit at some major points of the story like: Where did the Moon People come from?  What happened to all the living creatures in the world? What's the connection between [redacted] and the Moon People? However, you get nothing more than unanswered questions that are hardly addressed again. I feel like this anime focused so much on world-building and the development of Phos (which they did a great job at doing) that they completely forgot that they didn't really have a central plot for the first season. They had a bit of a plot in the beginning, but I feel like it was just scrapped or completely forgotten (which they ironically kind of addressed towards the end). From what I've heard, the manga is finally addressing the main points I referred to, so I suppose the ending was just setting itself up for the possible second season. Hopefully, we get more of a plot next season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is probably one of the best NEW anime to premiere this year. It's only 12 episodes, so it's not too long. Definitely check it out if you have the chance.",

On the contrary, nothing is happening, yet nothing is happening at a very very fast speed. There is never a drag, never a moment of confusion, even when we are introduced to entirely alien elements. There is a sense of perpetuity to the show, fitting perfectly to the characteristic of its premise. Emotions are pure, characters are benevolent yet diverse, complete with wonderful voice-acting. The animation plays out like a 20-minute long artwork, watching it in motion brings a sense of joy and satisfying comfort. Theshow has a plot, but the plot isn\u2019t extremely important. It is more centered on a theme of growth, which, when juxtaposed to a premise of unchanging, unaging world, is somehow more meaningful. \\n\\n\r\nRather than intrigues, its unanswered questions per episode portray a general sense of wonder. This sense of wonder does not bring any displeasure--- the displeasure for wanting to know more but not being able to--- but rather, a sense of wonder that brings comfort simply by our experience of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has emphasis on beautifully executed combat actions, and more importantly, the context for those actions. The \u201cbeautiful\u201d part is redundant, since everything else in this show are just as aesthetically pleasing. Yet, this show would not be an action anime. I would almost view it as a slice-of-life, for the lack of a better word.\\n\\n\r\nHouseki no Kuni is a show about gem just as itself is an refreshing gem.",

True creativity is extrodinarily rare boarding on non-existent. Some people I accredit uniqueness to being H.P.Lovecraft, and J.R.R Tolkien. \r\nThis show gives a truly special feeling. I can't think of any show that approaches the telling of it's own \"story\" in quite the same way or has a setting or casts of characters that are quite like this shows. \r\nStory: Story is probably the trickiest one of the aspects of this show to rate as italmost feels like it doesn't have one. What is there is simply the... observation, of the main character and the people she interacts with. In one sense very little changes and it is very artistically shown to be self-aware in this regard. But in another sense everything changes as you learn and grow with the MC. Incredibly well knit together overall.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Just really bloody gorgeous to watch. Nothing else to say. Oh and if you 'just hate any CGI and it ruins anime' get off your bloody high horse and appreciate beauty in more forms than the one that you've gotten used to, you boring F***.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I loved the sound. OST isn't exactly what I'd put on a playlist but it FIT. just nailed many of the scenes, whether humorous or sad, it was the icing on the cake of an already beautiful show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There was such a large cast of characters that criticizing it for any lack of character development in some of them would be ridiculous and require a 50 episode series during which time you'd forget about half of them anyway. In fact I was sincerely impressed with how much I enjoyed each and every character as they appeared and often reappeared. Their interactions felt naturally timed as their appearances always made sense in the context of the story. and they each had a quirk which not only made them unique (and fit in with the world setting) but also lovable. MC's character development was sudden, drastic, and completely appropriate. Which are three things that almost never go together in a sentence.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Simply put. I LOVED this show. It didn't make me obsessively binge. It didn't make me bored. It was just like \"HELLO ANIME BIATCHES! IM HERE. IM HERE, AND IM UNIQUE! TAKE ME OR LEAVE ME!\" And boy oh boy did people take it. I know i'm just a voice in the choir singing its praises to the heavens!",

In fact, its rather an underrated gem (no pun intended) which fell under most peoples' radar just because they found out that it uses CGI animation. Now let me tell you why they are wrong. \r\nLand of the lustrous takes place in a strange world that isinhabited with genderless gems that can actually talk. The story tells us of a precious gem named Phosphophyllite, the main character who \"works\" along side with the other gems and their Sensei,the guardian and father figure of the gems whom he guides them in their daily lives with only one purpose; to defeat a group of Moon beings called Lunarians which always appeared in the sky sometimes very near to their residental places just to kidnap the gems for some apparent reason. In the first early episodes i found the premise of the plot very confusing as it didnt provide us adequate information on what the plot is actually about but after you proceed watching until the very end,you can realise that the story is a breath of a fresh air,something that seems to be rarely found in modern anime nowadays because its not only just about the daily lives of the gems but it also unravels the origins of the gems and has an overbearing sense of mystery which will keep you captivated until the end of the episode. \\n\\n\r\nNow before you say \" oh no its another CGI anime? look what happened to berserk 2016 are you telling me that i should give houseki no kuni a try?\" well damn right you should as its artsyle and graphical animations are some of the most gorgeous ive ever seen in recent years. in fact i could proudly say that it if the anime participates in any animation awards, it will probably win which it actually did in the 2017 CG World Awards in the \"Best Work in CG Animation\" category. The battle animations are absolutely top notch i really enjoyed every single moment of it they are so fluid and polished its like im watching a cinematic cutscenes of a video game! that doesnt include on how vibrant the world of houseki no kuni is from the animated grass fields to the environments as a whole. there is a reason why it was nominated in many animation category awards and you know what? it totally deserves it.\\n\\n\r\nThe tranquill osts of the anime really captures the setting and the characters where at one moment you feel the sense of calmness as the gems gazed into the beautiful environments monologing their curiosities about themselves and the world around them while in other moments you can grapse the ambience of epicness when the gems are fighting with the Lunarians in the sense that it actually creates some sort of balance with the right usage of the music. I could say the same with the openings and endings especially the intro which does a splendid job representing the struggles of the main character trying to comprehend the world around her. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the strongest selling point would be the characters themselves especially in terms of the main character's interaction with the other gems. You got Phosphophyllite which has the lowest hardness according to the Mohs Scale (measurement of qualitative ordinal scale characterizing scratch resistance of a particular mineral/gemstones) compared to her (i had to used \"her\" as although the gems are genderless,their voice actors and body figures resembles that of a female so yeah) other friends but at the same time behaves like a hyperactive child wanting to show to her growth and maturity to her friends which she fails miserably as she always puts herself into trouble resulting in many unforseen accidents from being kidnapped by the lunarians to letting one of her comrades to be in various vulnerable situations. At first you may find her annoying,constantly boasts herself that she can do anything despites her being the weakest and the most fragile of them all but as the series progresses you will realise that her characterisation will drastically improve as she experienced occurings that teaches her the harsh and brutal reality in front of her eyes. While she maybe had that kind of personality at the begining but i actually found her really cheerful,a happy go lucky girl which she always embodies a smile in my face. That is how massive her level of character development is.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the side characters is also something that i have to praise to the animators for actually creating characters that blends really well in their world. Its one of the few anime out there that potrays the side characters not just being you know side characters that dont contribute any subtle or meaningful happenings to the show but here we have Dia (a diamond gem) probably the side character that i love the most and she is absolutely adorable i feel like i wanted to hug her! However he struggels seems to be different compared to the MC as her characterization in general is to proves to the one she loves,her best friend Bort that she can take care of herself which i think something that i appreciate. Other characters while not being that crucial to the overall plot also had their own distinguishable personalities to carry their own weight. \\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, whether you are offended to the fact that the characters are genderless despites being gemstones or not, Houseki no Kuni is definitely worth the watch. Although it had some minor flaws which could influence the enjoyment of many viewers, i really recommend this anime to almost every anime fan out there. from the beautiful CGI animations to the well rounded plot to how fantastic they incorporated the chemistry between the characters, its another one of those \"anime that features humanized characters\" genre that you should place in your watch list. overall i give it a 9.3/10",

            "content": "Wow, is this show a hidden gem (pun literally intended), so much so that people can be turned off by the aesthetics, but trust that those aspects are the reasons why it worked for this show: the captivating CGI animation.\r\nStory & Characters:\r\nIn a world where humans in the form of gems exist, each gem plays a significant role in keeping their population alive, with built-from-scratch aspects such as fighting against enemies (Lunarians) being the survival mode for most of the gems.\r\nPhosphophyllite, being the most spoiled and youngest of the gems, is a rather dull exception to the many gems that could support on their own,and enlists the Master of gems, Master Kongou (Adamantine) for his/her role to play by creating an encyclopedia for future gems.\\n\\n\r\nSo naturally, being the lightest, brittle and the most fragile, Phos must defend for himself (gems are genderless, gonna refer to guys or girls whenever appropriate), and having gone through many surgeries and fusions with other gems and materials, the Phos we now know is so different from when he first started out with, being the capable one to fight alongside the powerful ones (Bort, Antarcticite, Cinnabar etc.) with Rutile (gem surgery master) and will forever be etched in the Master's hands as one that resembles the most change.\\n\\n\r\nTrue to the manga of the same name, it's hard trying to copy and paste an ongoing series into the confines of a typical 12 episode show, but for the most part, it pulled off tremendously well.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nHere's where studio Orange's prowess lies at: CGI animation. At present the studio has done previous projects with help in the art department, and for a 1st solo try at an already-know-it's-bad-when-we-see-it troupe to hang for what it is, it truly destroys that thought of ours to become one of the most visually impressive anime to come out in Fall 2017. Heck, put this and The Ancient Magus' Bride side-by-side, and the difference is minimal, with the former and latter excelling at 3D and 2D respectively. As we all agree, this show is a very prime example of CGI done right in justice, and it never lets us down from start to end, keeping us invested at the visuals and background to even the clear-cut action scenes to a T.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAnother area where the show excels at its use of OST and BGM at the very appropriate timings truly gave us another shocker, and it's a fantastic one at that! The OP and ED are light-hearted, but also beautifully portrays Houseki no Kuni's environment, even to go so far as to make sure that the sound is quality too. The BGM could have been better, but its the exact same story with the OST, what more could you want?\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nFor a fact that most people will never watch CGI knowing that this anime's formula doesn't detract from the visuals, but it feels like every episode is always stringing the story and the soundtrack so beautifully that even what is invisible to the naked eye becomes an attraction in itself. And for a recommendation, give this one some time for you CGI haters, and pray tell this show fixes the convention of a troupe, and wiring it into a beautiful object of art that simply awesome in every right.",

So she wondered where the gems come from,  Andthere it goes, the gem-hunt by the moon-people.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting might be a little bepuzzling to viewers without a relevant cultural background, so I'll just list a few concepts that might shed some light on it.  \\n\\n\r\nShintoism.  Japanese pagan religion, basically believes that everything has a spirit.\\n\\n\r\nVajra.  The namesake of Kongo Sensei.  Means diamond/thunderbolt. Kongo is a loanword from Chinese, \u91d1\u525b, lit.metal+adamant.  The corresponding scripture is called  \"Diamond Sutra\", which is , according to Wikipedia, a part of the \" 'Perfection of Wisdom' genre, and emphasizes the practice of non-abiding and non-attachment. The Diamond Sutra is one of the most influential Mahayana sutras in East Asia, and is a key object of devotion and study in Zen Buddhism.\"\\n\\n\r\nApsara.  The most probable graphic archetype of the moon-people soldiers.  You can google image \"apsara Dunhuang\" to see them. Wikipedia again:\"a female spirit of the clouds and waters\"\"In Indian mythology, apsaras are beautiful, supernatural female beings. They are youthful and elegant, and superb in the art of dancing. They are often wives of the Gandharvas, the court musicians of Indra. They dance to the music made by the Gandharvas, usually in the palaces of the gods, entertain and sometimes seduce gods and men.\"\\n\\n\r\nPreta.  Possible spiritual archetype of the moon-people soldiers.  Hungry ghosts. Wikipedia:\"Pretas are believed to have been false, corrupted, compulsive, deceitful, jealous or greedy people in a previous life. As a result of their karma, they are afflicted with an insatiable hunger for a particular substance or object. \"\\n\\n\r\nKarma.  Cause and effect.  Again wikipedia:\"action, work or deed; it also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect). Good intent and good deed contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deed contribute to bad karma and future suffering.\"\\n\\n\r\nTa\u1e47h\u0101. Greed, craving, source of Dukkha, which means suffering in Bhuddhism. \\n\\n\r\nWhew, that was monolithic. \\n\r\n---\\n\r\nedit: apparently the imagery of phos being forged into an alloy of multiple substances also has an allusion to it. \\n\\n\r\nSeven treasure of buddhism, are gold, silver, lapis lazuli, ruby, crystal, coral and emerald, which may be associated with the Seven Factors of Enlightenment.\\n",

            "content": "Time for a somewhat controversial opinion, perhaps.\r\nSo this show is only 12 episodes long, which makes it a rather easy one to watch in-between longer shows. Therefore, despite the complaints I have, I'd still recommend trying at least the first few episodes to see whether or not it's for you. For me it wasn't, but then again, I only discovered that near the end, so there's some merit to be had.\r\nTo start things off! The show is set in the far-away future where a disaster has obliterated the land, and only very few organisms have survived/evolved. There's no more humans, and only a few typesof simple-ish animals like jellyfish, snails, butterflies, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus is on the gem-people! That's right - they're gems, even though they look human with a huge amount of make-up. Their anatomy and way of thinking is very different than that of actual humans, and they're effectively immortal. This mere premise brings with it a very interesting perspective on the world, which is interesting to think about.\\n\\n\r\nThere's 2 other notable races; the fish-people who probably have the most in common with humans, but we don't get to see much of them; and the lunarians, space-cloud-people from the moon who come down in strange cloud-space-ships every episode to try and kidnap the gem-people.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem I have with the show is that a lot of crazy random stuff keeps happening, and it never fully gets explored or explained, and the characters just kinda accept it without much questioning. In addition, character interactions are very strange, to say the least; all of the gem people have a certain quirk, but they act and think rather erratically. This made it very hard for me to keep up with the story, or to relate with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the characters - there's like 50 of'm? Quite a lot anyway, and even though their names are often associated with the gem they're made of, I found it hard to differentiate them, remember them, or care for them. Especially when they randomly throw in a new character at the last-but-one episode..\\n\\n\r\nAlas, the show also isn't finished yet. I'm sure(?) there will be a second season, but as it stands now, it's suuuuper open-ended, in a way I don't like. Cock-block, I think is the word?\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure there is a deeper meaning to it all, or a different mindset that's needed, but there wasn't for me. I was too distracted with the giant hindu-monster-dog appearing and disappearing, the sensei bashing in walls, Phos going between happy & depressed within seconds, Cinnabar's QQ, and the general ridiculous interactions, to become invested in the story.\\n\\n\r\nTHE PROS!\\n\r\n+ Super pretty to look at. Like, the cgi is really-really good. Some \"action\" scenes are amazing (even if it's just running), but even quiet scenes are beautifully choreographed and animated.\\n\r\n+ There's probably a deeper story somewhere?\\n\r\n+ It's short!\\n\r\n+ A quirky female lead who does evolve dramatically between eps 1-12.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CONS\\n\r\n- VERY open end, needs a good sequel.\\n\r\n- A large cast of characters, hard to remember/care for them all.\\n\r\n- Questionable story, a lot of crazy unexplained things and strange interactions.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I personally didn't enjoy it that much, but it is a small miracle of CGI and I'm sure there's more to it. Despite my given score I would recommend to watch it, because it's so short and unique. You won't find anything like it any time soon!",

Our main character Phosphophyllite, or only Phos, has a typical main character personality, clumsy and cheerful, they don't fight, unlike other gems, because they are too weak, they only have 3.5 of hardness, which is way too easy to be broken. With this, they know they are useless, this is when their sensei gives them their first job, make a Encyclopedia. This is the start setof the anime that you can see in the first episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm usually really critical towards art, and this time I had to give it a 10, I'm not a fan of CGI anime, I think the tradicional, 2-D animation much more beautiful and eye-pleasent, but my vision have changed with Houseki no Kuni. The art is superb, and sometimes I'd even forget that it was CGI, characters were beautiful, and scenario too. I think that the big point of all this was because of the story, the CGI was good because the characters were gems, if not, maybe things wouldn't be so good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe opening music is good, makes you 'in the mood' to watch the anime, but nothing that amazing too. The music wasn't amazing, so it didn't have a big impact, unlike the animation, but I can't say it was bad too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nJust like I said before, our main character is nothing really different, or special, but they really impressed me in the development of the story, they were really predictable sometimes, but I can affirm that I've never seen such a character development and change too in only 12 episodes, it really 'wowed' me. Even though they are changed I would say that I like more the way they were in the first episodes (but this is a personal opinion, you don't have to agree with me)\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nI saw this anime while I was in a 15 hours road trip, I downloaded it randomly just because I didn't want to be bored, but even if I started to see it just to kill time, it was a really enjoyable anime, I would immediately press the 'next episode' button because I really wanted to know what would happen next, it made me mad sometimes, other times sad, and happy too, and I don't know you, but for me if an anime made me feel emotions (that is not disgust or boredom, of course), than it's a good anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nSome things could have been better obviously, but I think this one should be a 'must watch' for every anime fan, it's sad that it didn't have the merit that it deserves, you won't be disappointed in watching this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEven though I know it's almost impossible, I really hope for a second season, I'd gladly watch it.",

I give my take of the anime and whether or not I would recommend it. \r\nStory: 8\r\nHouseki no Kuni (TV) has a very subtle and slow-moving plot. Throughout the 12 episodes, not much is really happening. The character development, except for one or two characters, are essentially nonexistent. For the most part, there isn\u2019t enough information to advance the plot. However, for the sake of this review, I will differentiate between plot and story. While the plot has left me wanting, the story is extremely compelling. The mysterious aura of the anime keeps the watcher wanting toknow more. Some nuggets are thrown around during the series, but none that are really that satisfying. But that is a good attribute, because these episodes do a superb job in setting up the premises of the story. By the end of the series, you are eagerly waiting for more information. As a non-manga reader, these episodes will entice you into reading the manga. The story does an excellent job in cultivating the watcher\u2019s curiosity. Throughout the anime, there are some themes that are philosophically interesting. The immortality of the gems and their reactions to certain events are intriguing, as well as the relationships between them. Overall, if one looks at this season as setting up the plot and introducing the premises of the story, then this project has done an excellent job.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this anime is simply amazing, and for me, one of the best part of this project. From episode one, I am thrown into this universe filled with vibrant colors and beautiful sceneries. This season is for the most part happening in one area, the island, but the watcher does not get bored with this. The island is beautiful, and the anime does a good job in illustrating the different areas of the island. The animation is fluid and sharp. Other anime should take note of this style and try to incorporate it. I never really understood the backlash towards the use of CGI. I think if the style is used correctly, it can be used to engage the watcher. This anime is a perfect example of how CGI can be used, and I felt many times that I was watching a movie style animation in a tv series. The great part is that most episodes were high quality. I never felt a huge quality drop throughout the episodes. The character design of the Gems were also well done. The Gems just seem to stick out whenever they are on the screen. They are beautiful. Overall, the art combined with sound makes this anime very aesthetically pleasing.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\n\tIt didn\u2019t seem to me as if this anime had many tracks to work with, but I believe that quality overcomes quantity. The soundtrack used for most scenes were fitting. The ominous soundtrack that came on during the Lunarian attacks especially stood out to me. I am not well taught in the different instruments and their cultural origins, but the soundtrack seemed to be influenced by Buddhist sounds. I may be wrong about that, but that is the inclination that I got. Overall, very good ost that helps engross the watcher into particular scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\n\tI mentioned earlier in the review the lack of character development, this is not necessarily a bad thing. The lack of development is related to plot. Since not much has really happened, the character development has been lacking. Based on the premise that these Gems have been living for hundreds of years, it also makes sense that the character growth will be gradual and slow. There a few events that happen during the anime that does push some character development, and this affects the main characters. Besides these characters, the development is null. The anime has a large cast, there are apparently over 20 Gems. It would be very difficult to flesh out all of these Gems, and I am rather glad that the anime does not attempt to do so. The character that are introduced and fleshed out are done well. The main character, Phos, is energetic, amusing, and sometimes annoying. She\u2019s a very likeable character. She does indeed develop throughout this project. Cinnabar, Bort, Diamond are also very unique and interesting characters. They have some development, though not as obvious as Phos. Since I am considering this season as an introduction, I believe that it has done a good job of introducing us to these characters. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I recommend this anime because it is unique and shows promise. This season has introduced the story and the characters. Hopefully, this gets a second season that will advance the plot.  The animation is of high quality, as well as the soundtrack. This is an enjoyable anime to watch. A few philosophical questions emerge within the story, and I hope this is explored more in the following seasons. Overall, I rate this anime  9/10.\\n",

The original manga artist Haruko Ichikawa illustrated the manga in such a unique style that fits the actually interpretation of these gemlike creatures. Although the anime does not truly give her art style justice, it does its hardest to get as close as possible with it, and you can see that effort.\r\nThis isn't a magical girl cutesy anime that explores the life of a weakgem, it explores what humanity can be driven to, and what risks people are willing to take in order to get stronger. It shows us how we humans can look like through the eyes of someone from a completely different world. \\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime, and dear lord do I hope they bring a second season. This will easily make history in the anime community as being an example of what future CGI should be. \\n\\n\r\nI have NEVER been more investigated on a rock, but seeing this has expanded my view on both what anime can be, and the perspective on what humanity is through another view.",

            "content": "Story 8/10: This is a show about a (rather large) group of rock girls competing for the affection of their sensei. They do this by helping to protect against these creatures called \"Lunarians\" that are always coming from the moon to try and capture them all. However, this is not the only threat to sensei's harem. There are many mysteries in this seemingly post-apocalyptic world which could very well throw his harem into chaos!\r\nArt 10/10: The show has a very appealing CGI look, better than any CGI show I have ever seen. This results in some impressive dynamic camera work. I recall one scene involvingthe girls and some tentacles that was extremely satisfying to watch. And in my opinion, the characters look just as cute as I can imagine they would in 2D.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: The soundtrack for this show it top-notch. It sounds like something right out of a big budget film. And the sound effects are great too, and are quite noticeable because of the sounds the rock girls are always making with their bodies.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: The main character Phos is ridiculously funny and gets a lot of development. The rest of them get pretty ok development. But most importantly, they are all cute. That being said, a certain character becomes noticeably less cute as the show goes on, which I wasn't really that thrilled about. And there is a certain relationship between two characters that seems incredibly important to the show, but doesn't really get that much time dedicated to it at all in the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10: I enjoyed this show immensely in the beginning and middle, but a bit less towards the end. I didn't find the ending to be particularly satisfying either. I'm really hoping for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10: The last few episodes and ending left a somewhat bad taste in my mouth, but I am confident that this will be a show that I will watch again someday, mostly for the comedy, beautiful artwork, and the cute characters. And I would be very excited if they announced a second season.",

            "content": "Houseki no Kuni, or Land of the Lustrous, is a stunning example of what CGI can do not only for visuals but for the way one can show a story, characters and a vast new world with its own set of rules and problems. \r\nI have still yet to see the whole of what this anime can give, though there are only 2 more episodes to go, but the manga has a lot of promise; much of this promise is shown in the anime and I have to say, it does an amazing job at carrying out everything that was poured into the original manga.The characters don't feel dull and every single one has some sort of spark within them that makes you want to listen to them more. They have brilliant dialogue that doesn't feel strange and every action they do throughout the episodes stays in that character whilst also helps to give another perspective or branch that makes the character grow into something wonderfully new.\\n\\n\r\nPhos (Phosphophyllite), to me at least, is an amusing yet interesting character and her progression throughout the runtime is captivating to say the least. I love their design, the way the voice actress delivers their lines and their interactions with the other characters like Diamond, Bortz, Rutile and certainly Cinnabar. They do come off as obnoxious and a little useless in the first couple of episodes but they develop beautifully into a character that I personally love to bits. \\n\\n\r\nThe score is stunning and enhances each of the expertly choreographed fight sequences perfectly; one thing I noticed coming in blind to this all was the excess of music that wafted through the scenes. It's fitting to the world and gives everything depth. If the visuals of the land that these characters inhabit didn't already dazzle the eyes, then the music can certainly lull anyone in. I love the opening OP, it is a personal favourite of mine and I wish to listen to it forever, and come to find that whenever silence descends upon the cast, I look for the music to fill in the gaps. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, it's intriguing. Having read the manga to it's current point in the english translation, I know it'll only get better (especially if Orange keeps on with their exceptional adaptation). But in the anime, things are slowly staring up. We are not at the 'meat' of it all but the story still sucks us in and the interactions between everyone is enough to entertain all. Phos is just fun to watch and the humour isn't all that bad, much of the animation lending to the intended jokes and/or expressions. They and the others give a nice view of their world and what it holds, their routines and roles coming to be tales of their own that shape Phos and those around them.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only downside I can see with this is that there are only two episodes left and there is so much more to explore. This anime is fantastic and truly should be watched; if not for the story, then simply for the characters and their world. I also have to say that this is mainly in CGI (Though I am not sure, I believe some bits are drawn as some parts in certain episodes seem to not follow the usual CGI style) and that can turn a lot of people away. With many messes in the style, I want to enthuse that Houseki no Kuni is a massive exception to the preconceived notions set upon CGI.\\n\\n\r\nYes, some bits are jarring but it is for the tension of a fight. Some errors occur but none that would be noticeable. I have to admit that some sets look a little strange, much like all the grass everywhere and the outlines put upon certain objects.But all the cast move normally, as normally as rock people can, and I cannot sing my praises enough about the combat and overall visuals that is on offer. \\n\\n\r\nGive it a go, fall in love with all this amazing anime has to offer. I cannot wait for the next two episodes and the coming chapters in the manga. I only hope that Houseki no Kuni gets the admiration that it deserves. It is not the best, nothing can truly be, but it is trying to break the limits that have been put before it. It's breaking a lot of expectations and I want it to continue doing so.",

            "content": "Episodes Seen at time of writing: 9\r\nI decided to start watching Houseki no Kuni today after seeing a handful of Diamond with Bort fanarts as well as the trailer on social media for a while, and I ended up catching up with it because of how intriguing and beautiful it was. To me it is one of those anime that manage to catch your attention at the very beginning, which says a lot about it.\r\nPhos, the main character, is presented as a childish and carefree Gem life form who, because of their fragility (Based on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness) is often mocked andher requests to partake in battle against the Moon Dwellers are denied, but instead of the usual plot where the MC suddenly becomes better and stronger, we see a more genuine, more meaningful journey of character development: What it means to become better, the reasons behind it, and the cost and consequences of becoming so.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 - This far in, I can tell the story of Houseki no Kuni is one of survival, but also of discovery; The world the story is set on is one full of mystery, and knowledge lost to time. After all, Gems are life forms that are seemingly immortal, so the concept of time is a bit lost and it's up to the MC to uncover bits of information gathered in their encounters and connect the dots to give meaning to the Gems' situation, how they came to be and what their reason to exist is. It's not hard to get hooked on the first 2 episodes, and after that, it just keeps getting better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 - Normally I wouldn't give this high a score on Art, but I was really surprised to have grown fond so quickly of it considering it's CGI, which most of the time just feels wrong. This show manages to make CGI look amazing, and I doubt it would look any better without it. The setting is luminous and fresh, the characters, although similar in body design, are easily distinguishable by their facial features, and the animation, especially in action scenes, is quite astonishing, once again, very impressive considering it's CGI\\n\\n\r\nSounds: 7/10 - The Opening song is catchy and even if you're the kind to skip it when binging, you'll probably find yourself letting it play most of the time. SFX are pretty appropriate and add a nice touch to certain situations, and it makes a great work setting the mood on every scene, action or otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 - Though there are 28 Gems, we hardly get to see all of them often, but they're all quite distinguishable, and they grow into you very quickly, especially our MC Phosphophyllite. A nice cast with great seiyuus and no annoying characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 - So far, this series has been a bit of an emotional rollercoaster, but all in the good sense, and it's a series that has managed to hook me up for the best part of the day. Every single episode had something exciting or interesting to offer, and the whole experience of watching it has been thrilling and always leaving you wishing to know what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 - Houseki no Kuni is a show that manages to convey a story of character development and meaning of self pretty decently. My sole complain is that it's only 12 Episodes long. It's a piece of work that definitely deserves being put out there for all to watch, like a pretty Diamond. It doesn't seem like it's being talked enough, and I fear it might be slipping under the radar, part of the reason being the general consensus of CGI in works like these, but I hope it gets the recognition it deserves soon enough, and either way I'll be looking forward with anticipation for its last 3 Episodes, though I hope it gets a second season sooner than later. At any rate, as soon as it's over, you bet I'll start reading the manga.",

They follow a \"Teacher\" of sorts and fight with \"lunarians\" which appear from the sky from time to time and try to steal one of them....\r\nWhile you dont' receive an answer to every question, the world is compelling enough, and throws many implications and hints at you, allowing you to draw your own conclusions. The story follows one long arc with events going on one after anotherin continuouty and also displays amazing character development for the main character. It ends up quite melancholic and sad in the end, and is interesting to watch:\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt is one of the most beautiful CG anime I've ever seen, although the fact that they use hand-drawn backgrounds often contributes to it. In the beginning there are few rough shots with a fairly wooden animation, but as the series continue advancing forward, those problems become less and less common. The gemstones are beautifully done as well, although there are few rougher looking substances in the series, this is pretty much how CG-based anime should be done. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10:\\n\r\nMany melancholic non intrusive tunes that contribute to the experience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10:\\n\r\nSympathetic characters, very believable, and amazing development of the main protagonist. Relationships, secrets and stories are hinted in very delicate manner, and aside from few more comedy oriented scenes you won't really find many stereotypes here. Very well done.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10;\\n\r\nI started watching it, put it on hold, then continued, and with time series became more and more amazing. So it was a case of slower start and show getting better and better over the time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nI'd dare to say this is a must see. The visuals are beautiful, characters are great, music is melancholic and soothing, and story, even though it doesn't resolve every question, is incredibly interesting. I'm glad I've stumbled into this show.",

            "content": "I find it preposterous to see this series fall short in hype & success compared to 2017's few hit titles that shall not be named, not because of what they are like or have done on their own, but because of what they didn't manage to do compared to Houseki no Kuni, or Land of the Lustrous, however you will it.\r\nThe imaginative setting of this title gives the viewer a chance to explore a universe that is shrouded by the mysterious factors that have surrounded it for ages through their own experience. You are tasked with uncovering the existence & truth of the gems, theLunarians (or Moon People) and what happened for that world to end up like this. That alone makes this an interesting experience from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nIf that wasn't enough, you have a peculiar but intriguing cast of characters who bring that universe to life. The gems, they are androgynous humanoids that are named after & based on actual ores, tasked with either, bluntly, doing work on the side or being on the front lines, if you will, which depends on how tough they are. Phos, the protagonist, is good for neither due to their low toughness and clumsy personality. Though it is until later in the series that they become an interestingly developed character, making them a memorable one as well.\\n\\n\r\nFor so long, CGI has been the thorn in a nail for the casual viewer, but for a series which is based on CGI from start to finish, it was remarkably well done. I can very much see & appreciate the amount of care put into fleshing out the detail of the environment, just wonderful. Truly, if all future titles were to be animated like this one, I'd want all of it.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a fantastic soundtrack that goes along with it. The opening and ending are rather great in terms of vocals & visuals, while the background music has been made with care to absolutely fit with the ambiance of this title and the events in it.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no complete ending in the story just yet, because the manga is still on-going, though the plot-line ending in this title is satisfying enough. Knowing that, Houseki no Kuni has a lot going for it and could become a monumental series due to the absolute joy of exploration it sets on the viewer & how intriguing the future of this setting is. Overall, I find this series to be a remarkable work and it is at least worth giving a chance, for I will certainly look into it more.",

            "content": "Obviously, not many people heard about this show until the crunchy roll awards. I saw that it was nominated for a lot and called one of the few good CG shows. I must say, it did not disappoint. \r\nThe story is about a gem being named Phos feeling useless and being told they were useless to the world and them attempting to find their place. It\u2019s easily relatable. Through the season, we get to see the relatively young gem mature both mentally and physically. By the end of the show they are so unrecognizable, that the show points this out. On top of this maincharacter arc, we get to watch most of the supporting cast shine and have their moments as both mentors and warrior....or just as a bunch of awkward golems. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is clearly the selling point of this show. This must have been some kind of passion project for the studio. Kinda of like Devilman Crybaby, the animation really makes a statement. It is shows like this that both help and hurt CG anime. It creates a desire to see more like it, but the problem is that most will not be done with as much care as this. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is very soft and whimsical. Even when the antagonistic Lunarians attack the gems island, the music becomes a beautiful orchestra. While there aren't many tracks to the ost, the show uses them effectively. The OP and ED are also pretty good and I rarely skipped either. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just under the art for me with this show. Nearly all the characters that the show focuses on are interesting and have a unique personality. The banter and general dialogue between characters is also pretty entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode is paced very well and I was constantly getting a sense of Miyazaki off this show. The camera directing for episode 10 in particular was absolutely incredibly. The fight animation flowed well and the slower parts had great tension and camera pans. The music during those parts only added to the scenes. The faces of the characters told the whole story when things were silent. All of the dialogue was brief and to the point. It\u2019s probably one of the best single episodes of an anime I\u2019ve seen in a couple years. On top of all this, it was one of the easiest Marathons I've had watching a show. I give most of the credit to the surprisingly adept dub that this show has. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would obviously give this a glowing recommendation. Go out of your way to watch this show. Hopefully, like me you'll be chomping at the bit for the next season.",

            "content": "This is what I think of when I think of the word beauty. Houseki no Kuni is a anime that stretches the imagination in ways that are executed perfectly. When reading the manga before I had watched the anime I was fascinated to see how this world shows beautiful parts of even the smallest things. After I had finished the last volume (volume 6 because that was the latest volume out) I was intrigued to see how the anime could present the beauty of the world in the same level of expression. review spoiler, It lived up to it.\r\nFirst before we get to the longdrawn out review let me tell you about the premise of Houseki no Kuni. The show is in a world where there are humanoids called gems. Each gem has a different hardness which tells how durable each of them are before they break. Gems with a hardness of 10 are very strong and are good with fighting while gems that are lower hardness's are more fragile and break easily. Gems are immortal in a way but they can get broken into many pieces. Once they are broken they can be put back together but if they are very broken it can take hundreds of years to be put back together. These gems are in a constant battle against this species from the moon called Lunarians. Much is unknown about what their motive is but more of the gems try to figure out what it is. Each gem has a job. Now lets talk about our main character Phosphophyllite (pronounced phos\u00b7\u200bpho\u00b7\u200bphyllite). Phosphophyllite aka Phos is trying to give a gem named Cinnabar that they find out about a job which is the main premise in the beginning. Finding a job for Cinnabar is very hard because Cinnabar has a issue where there is a thing that follows cinnabar around that will burn parts of gems. Now onto the real Review.\\n\\n\r\nWhen looking at the art of the show, something that you will notice is that it was created in computer graphics. This is something that has notoriously been known to be a problem in anime because it has not been done before in such a way that it lives up to the potential that you have to create great animation. Land of the Lustrous uses this fact completely to its advantage by showing scenes with complex shots, many moving parts and expressive movements. The show also uses it to showcase the beauty of the world and things around them. This is one of the main reasons why I love this show.\\n\\n\r\nLets talk about the story. The story is fantastic partly due to it's uniqueness and the creativity that makes the story. The story has a completely new and unique premise that just makes you want to know more and more about the world around you. You will always want to know what happens next which tends to be just as creative and interesting as the last piece of the story that you just heard. The main reason I watch anime is for stories that could not be told well in a live action setting, and this is definitely one of them. The story is too unique and creative to be expressed through a live action film or a live action show.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the characters. Each character is interesting and has a personality that is showed through well written dialogue. Each gem has a different personality that is also shown a bit through there actions and how they do them. When looking at the development and how the characters change throughout the show it is clear that the things that they go through effect the gems to change and live differently. When something bad happens to the characters you legitimately feel bad for what's happening to them even though it is fictional, this is the way it should be. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I will talk about is the sound. The music in land of the lustrous is fantastic and compliments the show in such a way that is perfectly executed and brought fourth. The music is placed where it should be and it is creative and composed very nicely. The Opening music and the ending music is both experimental and fantastic. They are creatively made songs that each sound good with the opening and endings.\\n\\n\r\nOverall watching this show was very enjoyable and was one of those shows that you cannot wait to watch more. I was continuously impressed more in more each episode about how they fine tuned each episode to be crafted perfectly and express the beauty in the world. \\n\\n\r\n10/10 aka Perfection\\n\\n\\n",

This series starts out pretty great. I liked the characters--especially the protagonist--and the threat is made clear from the start which puts a constant edge on the whole series. The threat has a clear direction and is well executed.  However, the protagonist's personality suddenly and drastically changes for the worse toward the end. She became boring, but not unlikable. The ending was pretty lame as it just ends in the middle of a conversation that isn't evenresolved after the credits. It's far from my favorite anime, but despite all of that, it's still worth watching if you have some time to kill, but there are probably better ways you could be spending your time since the ending isn't exactly satisfying.",

All BGM fit the scene and was not a distraction, rather an enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nI also appreciated how it used each gems characteristics to create personalities for the characters. I wish they used more common minerals/gems with more facts, but it was interesting for me being a chem eng major. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think if you like any action film, this show is definitely a watch. Give it like 2 episodes. It doesn't start slow, but it took me about 2 episodes to get used to its pacing and animation style. \\n\\n\r\n9.4/10",

The overall plot focused primarily on the growth of the main character, but despite the relative lack of events significant to the greater world, thestory never felt like it was lacking material. (+3)\\n\r\nThe pacing was excellent; I never felt like there were periods where the plot stalled or skipped. (+1)\\n\r\nThe literal interpretation of character development was, although not a completely original take, a unique element and superbly done. (+1)\\n\r\nEvery time it seemed like a mystery of the world was answered, a new question appeared. Although there were never a million questions open at once, there was never a lack of curiosity either. (+1)\\n\r\nThe little sci-fi bit about microorganisms is pretty unbelievable. It's not a big issue, but I have to dock one point for it. (-1)\\n\r\nTotal score: 5/10 + 5 - 1 = 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nHouseki no Kuni is the most beautiful anime I've ever seen. No other anime comes even close. CGI has such a bad rep for good reason; normally, it looks either like a completely failed attempt to look realistic or a lazy shortcut for moving parts. This anime doesn't try to look realistic with its graphics, it just tries to be a beautiful anime and succeeds spectacularly. Everything about the animation is just amazing. The fluidity of the movement is unparalleled, not only in action scenes but even just when the characters are standing around and talking. The colors are vibrant, the shading is just right, and the sheen effects are spot-on. The environment isn't showy in a way distracting from the characters, but it's animated in great detail and every pixel of every frame is a part of something spectacular. I'd rate the art an 11/10 if possible, for being the very pinnacle of animation, but all I can do is leave this review.\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe intro and outro were very good, but not so good that I didn't want to skip them. (+1)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack had a unique feel to it that fit the world to a tee. The instrumentation sounded almost crystalline, and was vibrant to match the visuals. (+2)\\n\r\nThe overall instrumentation was uniquely orchestral, very different from the electronic and rock features that are so common in anime. At least, it's different among the action-heavy animes that I like to watch. I didn't really notice just how well-composed the OST was until I listened to it alone after I finished the anime, because it just took such a backseat to the visuals, but if it were any other anime the composition would have really stood out. (+2)\\n\r\nTotal score: 5/10 + 5 = 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe side characters were pretty average both in terms of their development and their roles. (+/- 0)\\n\r\nThe main character was brilliant in every facet. Her personality and attitude were both very distinct and very well expressed. (+1) The way her personality changed little by little after every challenge she faced would be the first example in a master class on character development in anime. (+2) The way she interacted with all the supporting characters was very realistic and really drew you in and made you feel connected. (+2) There's more to say about her character, but we're already at a perfect score in this category.\\n\r\nTotal score: 5/10 + 5 = 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime. The art, the story, the atmosphere, and the characters all complemented each other and created complete immersion for me. \\n\r\nScore: 10/10",

            "content": "Watched this mostly because of the hype surrounding it when it was nominated for the Crunchyroll Awards 2017, but also because of a GIF I saw of one of its battle sequences.\r\nStory - 4\r\nSadly, this was the weakest thing it had going for it. Per se, there is no story that runs throughout the entire season, but there are various story threads that are introduced, but most of them are left incomplete or underdeveloped (with the exception of the winter arc). We are left with more questions than answers, in the worst way possible; they start a thread, go with it, then they leave ithanging at the opportune time to answer it. Sometime they even act as if it was never there, and while they (sort of) came back to one of the earliest threads in the last episode, all that left me with no sense of satisfaction when the final credits rolled.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\nRight from the get-go, I was totally on board with the 3D animation because not only was it so fluid and it worked so well with the kind of action in the battles, but that combined with the gorgeous 2D matte painting backdrops was stunning at times. I don't think I've said \"Wow, that looks really good\" that many times in one season of anime so far.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe OP was good, but not good enough for me to want to watch it every episode, though I watched it at least twice throughout the season. I never ended up watching the Ending Theme, not that it was bad, though. The music that plays during the episodes was very good, however, and it sort of reminded me of the music in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\\n\r\nThere were a lot of characters that we were introduced to (thankfully not every Gem was introduced), but you could definitely see the ditinct personalities in each one. A lot of them were played for comedy, but some got more development than others, which was fair enough, given the importance placed on them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\\n\r\nThe story problems detracted a fair amount of enjoyment from this (for me and my friend, who I watched this season with), but we revelled in the sheer absurdity of some moments that were given no explanation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\\n\r\nWhile very weak in terms of story, this anime is a breath of fresh air in terms of using great 3D animation, delightful characters, and sweeping music.",

It gets better and very different towards the second half (like all the anime i like i guess) and its very interesting,\r\nbut it feels like it'smaking stuff up as it goes along. Is it the problem of having a CG show where the elements cannot be made before producing the show for buget reasons no matter what? The whole thing feels like half of a series. The ending is no ending, it's a series mid point for sure. the series needs a second season to hold any water as a story.\\n\r\nThe most striking thing is the main character just switches, from ditsy and cute to badass and aloof, and it is actually justified. But I at least find it very bitter sweet and i got confirmation within the last episodes that it is what the series was trying to do, they built up this annoying but free character that becomes competent but shackled\\n\r\nis it told well? i cant say that, i feel like if there is a second season, everything needs to happen there. I inadvertedly spoiled myself some plot twists from the manga, and i hope the series will go deeper than those so as to be of any interest\\n\r\nthe issue i have with the sries i guess is that it feels like a first draft to me. peole getting acquainted with their cg and techniques\\n\r\nthis series re-paced could be a fantastic 6 episode OVA\\n\r\ncondense the ditsiness at the beginning which is aimless and annoying (but retain some as it is useful for setting up the characters) make a more tense middle act, that delves deeper in what actually happned in the series ( and make it so the main character doesnt snap as suddenly as it does in the series) and an actual end\\n\r\nim complaining a lot but i thought the series fascinating. lacking in substance but what little substance was there was of quality.\\n",

Original stories such as this needs a hats off, you don't find such things everywhere.\r\nThe sounds are (OMFG) good and the voice actors, mostly Phos', she is E P I C, she makes her live basically, just like how Shalltear said in Overlord ep (who df knows), she makes her become alive.\r\nArt... Crap... it's really good, I always hated CG animation yet, it was outstanding, it's always lively and the characters are justbeauties of art (and beauties amongst women). The scenes are always detailed to every nook and cranny, basically epic.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters... from original stereotype to original originality, the diversity just makes a great combo, and from what I've started to seen in the manga and in the anime... the counts adds up, 28 in total, I though there were more than 28 people as said in the story but I think it checks in good, to have 28 original characters +1 if you count sensei fit in this and still keep up with the goodness, is a really hard job, well freaking done. And as I said, the art is really fucking good on each of them. They all fit their role nicely and the main character's development went totally unexpected but I guess it adds good Venezuelan spice to the Japanese curry (do you even put spice in curry? dunno, im no japanese) \\n\\n\r\nBasically,  all and all, it's a honest-to-goodness masterpiece for me, I though I'd hate it since it was CG, but heck no, I loved it. My eyes even started to leak out at a certain episode. Well, tbh I don't really wanna read the manga cos I'm waiting for another masterpiece such as this to have a season 2 but I also wanna read cos the manga is also good and I really wanna know the rest... AH SHIT.\\n\r\nWell, I can confirm on my side this is good. Now.. where's season 2?",

Explaining, and showing this to a friend who dead-panned me with a stare: \"This is the most boring shit ever\" and honestly - I can see it, it's just hard to explain why it's great.\r\n-\r\nThe show seems to be set somewhere in the future, humans seem extinct? and replaced by strange people from the moon and our featured cast of shining crystals. The characters are made from things like jade, diamond, ruby etc. and have the visual flair to go along with their given crystal. The show is mostly 3d animated, butfor once, this is not at all a negative. It adds a unique look to the show that sets it aside from most other animes. It's not necessarily the best looking show I've seen: the landscape and anything that doesn't feature our jolly cast can lack some detail - still, the character style makes up for this and the visuals are in that area quite impressive.\\n\\n\r\nA cool idea was to make the characters genderless, at least that is the impression I got. Aside from rare occasions, they don't seem to specifically refer to any character as specifically male or female. This works rather well with our main character: I really never specifically identified that character as specifically male-ish or female-ish so if the idea was to make the character seem genderless, I thought they succeeded quite well. This is not really the case for the other characters though. Almost all of them are very feminine, especially the character Dia/Diamond. It's quite apparent that she was made to be a cutesy girl which I felt went against that genderless quality.\\n\\n\r\nAs the source material is still on-going this is not a 'finished' story. The 12 episodes leave a lot left unexplored, hopefully for a second season. For instance; a significant source of conflict is the ever unyielding attacks by the 'moon-people' who tries to steal the crystals (AKA the characters) and bring them to the moon. So far, they are really just en masse of white figures without any characterization at all so the 'villains' don't really have any depth (so far at least).\\n\\n\r\nThe setting, the style, and the characters really add something unique that makes the show quite different from others I have seen. I especially liked the main character, he/she was awesome, cute, comedic, laughable, eccentric, lovable - just filled with adjectives!\\n\\n\r\nIf you watch an episode or two and don't like it, you probably won't later on either. If for some reason the show is just strangely appealing though - you'll probably love it by the end!\\n\\n",

The main character\u2019s transformation seems to want to emulate the idea of transgender changes. The main character interacts with a wide variety of other genderless gems, as well as gendered other creatures (which really confuses them!)\r\nCHARACTERS: The characters could easily be reduced to one dimensional tropes, but instead they\u2019re all very interesting. I never felt cheated by this anime in the area of character development. One character in particular is meant to be perfect, but an episode focuses on their ownfailings. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: I don\u2019t generally like 3D rendered anime. But I found that in this anime the 3D style greatly increases its allure. The characters are in constant motion, and it seems realistic as compared to possibilities from 2D animation. In other words, they really do seem more advanced. It\u2019s particularly gorgeous when the characters are in specific lighting and their hair shines, reflecting all over everything. Color, lighting, materials all play a valuable part of this anime. The manga is very plain. This was a very welcome improvement!\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The music that plays whenever the Lunarians appear is really eerie and beautiful. I also enjoyed the voice acting, as the main characters are genderless, so it must have been tough to cast a neutral sounding group of people. Even so, many characters definitely lean towards one gender or the other, and that is sometimes reflected in their voices.",

Our characters defend themselves from a different race since it was what they have been doing for as long as they remember. What I can tell you is that there is not much development for the plot, butrather the focus of the development was on our characters. The main character is the \"useless one\" in their group, and as the story progresses, we will witness the changes s/he has gone through. There might be some aspects that might be confusing, nevertheless, the plot was still all right.\\n\\n\r\nWith regard to characters, each and every one of them have their own personality, quirks, duty, effectiveness/usefulness and role in the story. They can be easily recognized (and remembered) due to their individuality and character design. Considering that our characters are actually gems (thus, the pun), their names were also based off on those precious rocks. In a sense, you can say they were well-written. On the other hand, it could make you wonder who the \"antagonist\" really is. As I have mentioned, the focus of the series was not the resolution of the plot, but the development of the characters. I'll leave that portion of deciding which character(s) is/are the true antagonists. My only objection is that the show claims that our characters are \"gender-less,\" but all of them, because of their character designs, can be easily classified as male or female.\\n\\n\r\nIn the art and animation aspect of the series, some might be put-off or discouraged in watching the series, mainly because of the computer-generated imagery (CGI). However, do not fret, as the art and animation was not bad per se. Still, you might have qualms against it due to it not being conventional. It is a bit different, but it isn't worse as I have imagined. Give it a chance after a few episodes, and you can decide then.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the sound quality, it was fine. I have no complaints. Except for the OK opening and ending songs, and the effective use of the particular background music in the concluding theme, I found nothing else that was noteworthy in particular.\\n\\n\r\n[TL;DR] \\n\r\nHouseki no Kuni was a gem because of the characters, and it was also considered a gem because not many can appreciate this type of show (CGI).\\n\r\nStory : 5 (40% = 2)\\n\r\nCharacter : 9 (25% = 2.25)\\n\r\nArt & Animation:8 (20% = 1.6)\\n\r\nSound : 7 (15%= 1.05)\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 6.9 ~> 7/10\\n\r\n(Enjoyment : 8, Not Included in Criteria Rating)\\n",

            "content": "This is the worst experience i've had with an anime from 2017, also, my first review. I did not rewatch it, i just finished doing so, can't bring myself to do it again.\r\n I had such a terrible experience i could not help but bring myself to write this. I recommend you to check it out for yourself, though.\r\n For now, i'll talk about the positives first.\r\n It is technically well done in pretty much every area.\r\n The visuals are fantastic. This is by far the best 3D anime i've seen. It's JoJo's Part 1-3 OPs or ArcSystem works level of quality we're talkingabout. \\n\r\n The animation is also great, despite my experience, the action moments were the parts i could enjoy the most because they were so well done.\\n\r\n Camerawork's also very good - they didn't overdo it with wacky movements because of the 3D environment, like Berserk did. When it does that, it does so well because it's not so extreme.\\n\r\n The music and sounds are fantastic, they are by far the part of this i enjoyed the most aside from animation and visuals. \\n\r\n Speaking of which, both the OP/ED songs are good and fit well with the visuals, though i wish the OP's visuals meant more - it is a bit generic. The ED has got more to offer in that regard.\\n\\n\r\n Plot devices, plot holes, bad explanations for things. The story is the thing i had the most problem with, and it's what pissed me off the most.\\n\r\n I saw a review and it said the story is up to interpretation. If that's the best thing you can tell me about it, then you are really stretching - just like Phos arms.\\n\r\n I also find the pacing to be bad, either that or i am just incredibly shaken by what happens through episodes 1 and 8, then 9.\\n\r\n In the first episodes i thought Cinnabar was going to be the love interest of the main character, while this didn't have any impact on my enjoyment of the show (not much), i felt like i should write it down.\\n\r\n The exposition gets kinda bad sometimes, at least i felt so. Could've been done better. Also, the repeating of lines gets annoying when it happens, it is not necessary.\\n\r\n Another thing, some characters' backgrounds were introduced (or entire characters themselves) in very awkward moments. Especially at the end, when that happens thrice or twice. \\n\r\n Can't write spoilers, but i'll just say the main character is very unlikeable, and does pretty much nothing throughout all those episodes.\\n\r\n The characters are a bit too similar. Neck down they are all visually the same, the only different ones are the guy, the medic, Phos, and another character on ep 11. They wear the same clothes, have the same height, have no variation in the chest area, have long legs, and all of them have firm butts. Yes, you read that right - just look and you'll understand what i mean.  Their faces look great, though. Especially the hair and eyes. Very pleasing to look at.\\n\r\n Oh yes, they also don't get a lot of development. Which kinda ties in with the problems in the last episodes. I guess their interactions are comical? I did not manage to laugh much after the first three episodes, so i can't say their attempts worked.\\n\\n\r\n The best episodes were by far the last 4, though it's not saying much. The main character actually did things, instead of having things done to.\\n\\n\r\n Something i had a big problem with: the allusions to self-harm, depression and... Effort in general, in this anime are weird, which is what happens in the first 8 episodes, and i don't know where the hell they were doing with that. I don't think it went quite well.\\n\\n\r\n Despite my experience, overall it really is not as bad as i made it sound at the beginning. I couldn't bring myself to enjoy most of it, i tried. Though, i liked the rest of it. Anything that didn't involve the useless main character before ep 9 i enjoyed.\\n\r\n Overall it's technically well done and the last episodes aren't as bad as the others.\\n\\n\r\n I do understand how people can like this, it's pretty good, i just had a massive problem with the main character throughout it. Too big of a problem, really.\\n\\n\r\n I'm coming off of this with a hopeful look towards the future, i hope it gets a second season and that it's miles better than this. Though, I'm already on the ride anyway, so it's not like i can help and do anything else.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I found this to be a relatively unique anime and it was executed well enough, but there were also some major problems and I found myself confused about many elements of the characterization. \r\nThe premise is easily one of the best parts about the anime: very creative yet quite simple. The presentation of the world is also done very well with stunning views and beautiful saturated colors. I love how the girls are made of crystals and gemstones, although there are some logical fallacies that come with that premise but it's not a problem, I can easily suspend my disbelief for that. \r\nHowever the characterizationconfused me. Many of the characters would all of a sudden do something or say something that seemed very odd, random, and not consistent with their established character. There are also a lot of characters and it seems that the creators were trying to give each character some screen time and characterization but there just was not enough time to do this so some of the characters ended up confusing. \\n\\n\r\nEven some of the more important characters who have a lot of screen time were inconsistent or not well established. Phos was annoying sometimes and when her character changes, it's unclear whether it is due to memory loss or her trauma. Sensei had some character elements hinted about him, but it wasn't executed very well so when there is a reveal about him, it seems strange and out of left field. Not sure what Alex's other personality was all about and what the point of that is at all. Cinnabar seems to be an important character but she is given very little character development for the large amount of screen time she's given. Every time we see her she's doing the exact same thing and saying the exact same thing, and whenever she comes in contact with Phos she does the same exact thing every time. Bort also gets a lot of screen time but her character seems incomplete and oddly one-dimensional. There are just many specific issues with the characters and it slightly takes away from the viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a couple things I had issues with concerning the visuals. Firstly I'm not the biggest fan of CGI anime, but that's not really that big of a deal, the characters just have very unnatural movements. But the other issue is that it seemed like they were trying to be creative with the composition of each scene but it was unsuccessful at times. For example the view would switch to a wide shot and the characters in the frame would be placed at the very edge of the screen or the corner for no seemingly good reason. And this happened so often that I started to take notice and get annoyed by it. There were no stunning backgrounds or moments of isolation that needed to be conveyed in these shots, they were just jarring and strange. But on the positive end, the character designs were great and the world was stunning especially with the use of saturated colors.\\n\\n\r\nJust as a side note, some of the edits were strange where they would linger too long on a moment. The opening and ending were both painfully mediocre, although some of the soundtracks were great and invoked the necessary moods. And I can't believe they ended the season on such a sudden and jarring cliffhanger. I will be very upset if there isn't another season coming. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I highly enjoyed it and would give it a 7. I could easily see myself giving the second season (if there is one) a higher score if they do a good job with it.",

            "content": "I can tell you that this is literally the gem of the fall season. (overused pun for this anime)\r\nOh boy. Seeing how cheesy, fake-looking, and plasticy 3D animation looked in other animes I watched before, I had really low expectations for this. I couldn't believe the >8 star rating here on MAL. My curiosity grew with each review, and the synopsis seemed rather original, so I took the dive into the first episode on a lonely Saturday nate.\r\nTwo days after, I watched the remaining 11 episodes of the season and took a deep breath at 3AM in the morning. This anime was really the biggestsurprise I had, and I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: a fat 10/10\\n\r\nThe first episode immediately captured me, even without the awesome opening that keeps me from skipping it in the later eps. For me, the pacing throughout each episode and through the whole anime was perfect, and there was never any \"overflow\" of information as I tried watching. It was quite easy to follow the story since there were never any moments that made no sense. The first few episodes create the world and setting, developing Phos and her childish character as well as other characters in the story. The amazing cliffhangers and twists that eventually got the story into the deeper and more solemn second-half of the season were very reasonable, and I didn't find myself screaming at my monitor as to why things were happening.\\n\\n\r\nArt: highly, highly acceptable 9/10\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, the CG COMPLETELY surprised me. The lush grass, the smooth animation, the amazing facial motions, hand motions, and LITERALLY EVERYTHING. However, there were some parts during the show were the camera panning seemed a bit \"excessive,\" and in my opinion a simple cut and not a complicated pan from one character to another would fit better. Additionally, the animation in the show would get noticeably laggy, but not to the point of potato quality. It usually happens where the animators had to render multiple moving characters and objects, so I can't give them full criticism for that, but it was jarring when I noticed it.\\n\r\nThe character design just simply aced my standards. The hair for each character is off-the-charts, with unique light refraction, textures, highlights, bumpiness, and colors for each of them. It's almost impossible to confuse one character with another by looking at their hair, since that's what the show wants you to look at. Relating to that, all the gems have similar body shapes and clothing, but in my opinion the fact that they're all similar fits their character better. They all are just gems, but with different properties and alloys.\\n\r\nThe opening is beautiful as well. It's very clear a lot of time and effort was put into it, with extremely smooth animation, incredible small details, and amazing visuals that would please any eye. The beautifully rendered gems that are scattered throughout increase the colorfulness of the opening and overall does not look very cluttered and messy. Though, as it it should be, the opening song increases the enjoyment of the opening ten-ten-ten-ten-fold, and I will go over this part of the anime in the next section.\\n\\n\r\nSound: my ears have been graced 10/10\\n\r\nFrom the opening, to the background music, and to the ending, each track blessed my ears.\\n\r\nThe opening is a chill, soothing track that perfectly fits the opening. Each instrument in the song is used in unique ways, from that sexy bass guitar to the sound of the drummer hitting the rim of his snare, the soft crescendo of cymbals between various parts of the song, the quiet piano, the catchy and simple lead and rhythm guitar, the deep and long violin notes, and finally the amazing singer that completes the relaxing and soothing experience of the opening. Without a doubt, I can rank this opening as one of the best or THE BEST opening I have seen with my own eyes. \\n\r\nDuring the episodes, orchestral music takes the role as the backing soundtrack. Each track is perfect for each scene, with the right amount of intensity in each note that adds the appropriate feeling to whatever's happening. Never was there a moment in the show were I felt like the music was off or didn't match the scene. \\n\r\nThe endings for the anime were equally calming as well, and the ending for episode 8 fits the events that happen in the ep well. I don't like it as much as the opening, but I still find the openings enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: a diverse 9/10\\n\r\nPhosphophyllite, the main character, is a very interesting character. The youngest and one of the more fragile characters on the Mohs hardness scales, their childish, reckless, and fighting-hungry personality was a personality that I immediately liked as soon as the show started. However, the stuff that happens and changes later on because of story-reasons is also nice to watch. I can't really discuss their character much without spoiling half the season, but they long for a proper place in their community of gems. But in my opinion, Phos's character got more and more amazing as the show progressed.\\n\r\nThe other characters, except maybe for  Cinnabar, aren't focused on that much and are just there to spice up the story or take part in a little arc. If the season was longer than 12 episodes, I'd appreciate if more character was developed for the side characters. Otherwise, the other characters are developed enough to have a basic understanding of who they are and what they are.\\n\r\nSimilarly, Cinnabar, a mysterious, poisonous, gloomym and night-walking gem isn't developed much in the show, and thus their mysterious personality, but is a frequent part in the story and appears constantly. With Phos making a promise to Cinnabar in the beginning of the show, it soon serves as a goal for Phos to fulfill throughout the whole season.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: no regrets 10/10\\n\r\nLike I said before, many things in this anime are extremely enjoyable. The opening, the art, the sound, everything else; I don't want to go over it all again. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: rewatch rewatch rewatch 10/10\\n\r\nThis is one of the best animes I've watched, seriously. I highly expect this to be a candidate for anime of the year, and I would want an award for the amazing CG in the anime. This is the first anime to put my in the edge of my seat for episodes straight, back aching and face inches away from my screen. I have no ounce of regret for this show, and I wish it a good future.\\n\\n\r\nSECOND SEASON QUICK PLEASE",

Sometimes it isn't very clear who is good or evil and what is right or wrong.\r\nPhos, though he/she is the main character and carries the main plot forward, isn't the only interesting evolving character. The other characters' histories and stories that is slowly revealed tells us what motivates them and why they are who they are and how they have changed over time. They are all equally moving and essential in completing the whole package.\r\nThe story's pacing as it unfolds, weavedinto the beautiful hypnotic orchestral music score that often swells in sync with the intensity of the scenes, further deepens and intensifies the emotional value conveyed. It thoroughly seduces and pulls you into the narrative and connects you with the characters as if you were part of them.\\n\\n\r\nBy the third or so episode, you're already sucked into their world and have become mesmerized by the dazzling beauty of the environment. You start becoming sympathetic or even empathetic to their joy and hurt. The mystery and reason for their existence and intrigue by the relentless conflict between the groups begins to haunt you. The tension and desire to not experience any loss because it would be too painful not to be able to see each wonderful character in future episodes can be overwhelming at times.\\n\\n\r\nLunarians! Keep your hands off my jewels!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nAhemmm...\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the well executed 3D animation, creative cinematography, snappy editing, and fantastic voice actors gives this anime a polished finish and is very satisfying to the viewer and earns an absolute recommend rating from me.",

Some of the fight scene sound effects are pretty questionable, but the music makes up for it. We can finally experience Houseki no Kuni in aform where the characters are (usually) on-model, instead of rarely.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, if, like me, you are one of those fans initially drawn to Houseki no Kuni by Phos's magnetic personality, you might not find much reason to keep watching after it's gone. I didn't. The action scenes never interested me. I never thought the mystery behind the three races was particularly profound or interesting. I already know what happens and I still don't care for it.\\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind that four episodes of the post-winter arc is nothing compared to the some-40 chapter long drawn-out, boring slog the manga turns into.",

You get so invested in the mysterious angle of the show and the game changing events hit you hard. I loved every episode even though each one ends on a cliffhanger but that's what brings the audience back.\r\nI'm surprised people gave it a low score without even finishing the series and hopefully they went back and changed it. Seeing how it has a 8.0 I'd say the anime has become a gem for alot of people. By the end ofthe season I was missing the old cute carefree Phos alot do I went back the reached all the episodes twice and ended up catching all the fine details I missed my first watch through.",

            "content": "After browsing the review section for this show, I found few if any that discussed the show as I had hoped. Granted, I decided to write a review of my own. I won't give a basic description of the show as I found the MAL summary to do just fine, so I will quickly jump into the different criteria of the show.\r\nArtwork: 9\r\nFirst I wanted to start with artwork. This is important as Houseki no Kuni is one of the premiere shows with such a strong CGI presence. In the past I avoided CGI (examples like rokka no yusha and Ajin) as these artistically leftme fairly disappointed but in the case of Houseki no kuni, I give it praise. The art took a moment to adjust too but action scenes were crisp and fluid, movements seemed logical, and the charecters were very nice to look at (Dia was my favorite). I found this show quite refreshing in the sense that the fluidity and style felt very professional and exciting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nI found the characters in this show to be fairly well rounded. Characters felt distinct and played out different roles well. Granted the cast of this show (15-20 characters) some felt well constructed and some came and went just as fast as they arrived. Character's had personalities that felt viable, but many were very basic and can easily be tied to tropes in other shows. Of the 20 or so, I'd say 6 of them felt even lightly noteable while the rest felt they were more for a comic moment, or to assist the progress or feeling of business at the school.\\n\\n\r\nStory/plot: 7\\n\r\nPlot is where I felt this show hinged on greatness and fell flat. The beginning of the story illuminates pho as a mischievous, troublesome, and over confident girl with high aspirations but later, I feel this touch is lost. I recognize they build the show  around her growth and change but the big picture seemed lacking. If I'm honest, I just felt the show didn't have much of a plot for a while except for the first few, and last few episodes. It felt very one dimensional,fight and survive over and over until finally something happened to move the story along. A few other scenes felt out of place as well. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nI'll be honest, the intro was pretty but overall I found the music rather neutral. It wasn't super impactful or memorable in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I gave this show a 7 in enjoyment and 7 overall. The show had a nice art style, some fun action scenes, quirky characters and a unique premise, but the direction of the story felt somewhat unfinished and lacking. If your looking for a quick and simple watch, this definitely fits the bill. I enjoyed it, but I would say it could have been better. \\n",

            "content": "While I found this anime to be a refreshing breath of fresh air when it came to a unique art style that properly utilized CGI, character development just fell flat for me. The MC of Houseki no Kuni goes through this \"coming of age\" process that I've seen time and time again and I just felt like the execution was poor. I felt like it was forced, haphazard and extremely disorienting. Don't get me wrong, I understand overall why things happen the way they do, but I felt like even with the set progression it could have been executed in a much more thought outway. The saving grace is that I enjoyed the character development for all the other gems. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as enjoyment goes it wasn't bad. I enjoyed the story for what it was, because it was much more original than anything else I've watched recently. I do however believe that biggest issue I had with the story and therefore effected my overall enjoyment was the massive number of loose ends. This show had a tendency to open up pandora's box in one place, never close it. Then open it up somewhere, never close it and so on and so forth. I felt like there were a million plot arcs that were started, but never actually resolved. While I am all for cliff hangers (and reading the manga), I felt like once again execution was lacking. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was a good experience. I laughed. I cried. I got really pissed off. I take into full account that I have personal bias about execution, so with that in mind I give this show tons of points for great story, art, and sound. It was definitely a fantastic ride.",

With a hook established in the forefront of the narrative in a world of symbolism reminiscent of Buddhism, there appears to be disclarity in the direction of the anime. Houseki no Kuni tempts the audience into an intriguing mystery in regards to the battle of the gems and lunarians with a more micro focused side-plot of protagonist's Phos' endeavor to establish an emotional rectification of the lonesome and distrustful Cinnabar, yet fails to deliver on both fronts.\r\nWith comedic meandering within dialogue, and somewhat exciting action scenes, Housekino Kuni continues to delay the primary focus of the fore mentioned hooks with no satisfying conclusion. Although character progression is evident within Phos' transformation throughout the series, it appears abrupt and contrived, causing the metaphor of change and reincarnation to lose its impactfullness. This 12 episode series, only manages to establish the basis of Phos' search for the truth regarding her master and the Lunarians. Its long winded and comprehensive building of both character and worlds is meaninglessly padded with seemingly inconsequential events leading me to have great disinterest in the series only worsened by a dissatisfying ending with little closure.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps I have not watched or analysed the series in the appropriate symbolic lense to truly appreciate this series. I found myself beginning to dread watching the series in hope for a it to improve. Yet ultimately I found myself at the conclusion of the series dissapointed and disinterested in the world and mystery which had only captured my interest intitially.",

It deserves all the praise it has received for CG work:  animation is very fluid, character faces are expressive though CG constraints prevent exaggerated expressions common in anime, and shot composition during action scenes justifies use of CG. This alone cannot carry a show, though. Fortunately, I also loved the soundtrack and the show\u2019s world-building. Unfortunately, the show fails move out of the world-building stage. Each time a concept was introduced, it was fleshed out just enough to spark intrigue, and then cast aside. There\u2019s a looming sense throughout the show that theywere on the precipice of a revelation that could shatter their society. The show\u2019s pacing was slow, so I expected it to drop that tevelation and end on a cliffhanger, but there was no payoff. It just... ended. The characters are all pretty one-note. Their interactions are predictable, but charming in a \u201ccute girls doing cute things\u201d sense. Phos stood out from the rest of the group and was the only character to change significantly during the show\u2019s run, but that change didn\u2019t really feel earned. I\u2019d gladly watch a srcond season, but I can\u2019t think of a reason to recommend this show to anyone until that season arrives.",

            "content": "LAND OF THE LUSTROUS is a gorgeously realized tale about identity, self-worth, and what one is willing to do to change their circumstances. Set on a small crescent-shaped island in a vast sea, the story concerns a cast of anthropomorphic gems that are ostensibly female in character and attire, but actually genderless. Of course, gems are things that hold high value in the context of our own lives, so the audience is already primed to think of the characters in terms of their worth.\r\nBut every gem has its flaws.\r\nPhosphophyllite, the protagonist, has become all too aware of their own (everyone refers to themselves with singulargender-neutral pronouns). Weak and brittle, Phos is unable and forbidden to join their comrades in combat against the Lunarians, strange invaders from the moon who arrive at regular intervals to kidnap the sapient rocks for some mysterious purpose. These assaults are seemingly the only events of interest in this small and otherwise boring world; the Lunarians both threatening and defining the gems' existence. Barred from participating, the relatively young Phos has little else to do but laze around in the grass, which is exactly where we find them in the show's opening shot. Their peers berate them for being a slacker, but what else are they to do?\\n\\n\r\nKong\u014d-sensei, a figurative and spiritual father to the gems, comes up with a rather mundane task for Phos to complete instead: writing out an encyclopedia. But Phos is clearly not interested, aspiring to be more like the hardy fighters of the group. This, along with their young naivety, results in reckless behavior that frequently shatters their vulnerable body, catalyzing a series of physical and mental changes over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the unique world invites a variety of intriguing mysteries, these aspects of the show are actually rather slight and understated. Far more compelling is the existential quandaries the characters are exposed to. Phos isn't the only gem struggling with their body and potential. The gloomy Cinnabar sequesters themself from the rest of the gems because their poisonous body is liable to cause harm. Diamond is everything Phos wants to be, but still lacks self-esteem under the shadow of the even stronger Bort. This is a very character focused piece and they never fail to catch me off guard with their utterances and gestures. Every gem comes off as distinct with attention to detail in the way they move and act. Not every gem gets nearly the same level of attention as Cinn or Dia, but they are all a small joy to watch none the less. That LAND OF THE LUSTROUS can bring them to life in such short moments is no small feat.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, one cannot forget the marvel of the studio Orange's CG work. Not since the tantalizing potential of Yasuhiro Yoshiura's experimental short AQUATIC LANGUAGE have I seen a mixture of 2D animation style and 3D CG used to such visually dynamic effects. I appreciate animation, but especially traditional 2D animation and anime, because the nature of the medium naturally results in very deliberate and stable compositions. The Frenetic editing, intensified continuity, and camera movements so common in mainstream American cinema are less common in this space; no team of editors sitting around monitors trying to make sense of the coverage from half a dozen cameras, no claustrophobic ubiquity of reverse angles. Is it not somewhat ironic that the medium in which anything can be realized is so often more restrained than what we are used to seeing in live-action? \\n\\n\r\nBut it's also refreshing to see experimentation and a break from this norm. The CG character animations and camera movements are dazzling here, although still a bit laggy. The action scenes especially are a tour de force as the camera whips around and tracks the gems as they charge into battle. A very tense long-take towards the end of the show should close the mouths of any skeptics. But LAND OF THE LUSTROUS is still restrained most of the time. Actions scenes are brief and spaced out. Outside of these moments, the camera is locked down, allowing the expressive character animation to shine on its own. 2D animation still plays a role and is seamlessly blended into gorgeous backgrounds and close-ups when more nuanced expression is needed. Takahiko Ky\u014dgoku direction is strong, often choosing long shots with central symmetric framing that stages characters against the stark and rather lifeless environments. No doubt Haruko Ichikawa, author of the manga on which the series is based, deserves much of the credit for these compositions as well. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps what surprised me the most about LAND OF THE LUSTROUS is just how funny it can be. The proceedings are never too dark or dire for an injection of humor to seem out of place. The characters react to things in the most unexpected of ways. A reoccurring gag involving Sensei's sleeping habits had me laughing out loud. I love these characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe overarching plot isn't too detailed or special, although there is a hint of a humanity divided. Will Phos become the bridge connecting it? Will the change they undergo be for the better, or will they regret losing other parts of their identity? It's these character-related questions that have me hungry for more rather than the larger mysteries. But for now, Phos's central character arc in this cour, which comes full circle by the end, is enough to strongly recommend what I consider to be one of the best shows of the last few years.",

A unique coming of age story, told from a perspective impossible and alien to humanity.  The only flaw is the ending. Read. The. Manga. My 9 only really stands because I know I continue to like it ever onward.\r\nWckd: Score: 8\r\nReview: Houseki no Kuni is refreshing and original. Going into it all I knew was that ithad 'CG done well'. And it does it very very well, in fact where  normally CG is a detriment to a show, in this case the CG adds to the charm of the show. The animation is fluid and lots of detail has been put in the little movements of the characters. The show has interesting characters, with interesting 'properties' relating to their real world mineral counterparts. The world itself is interesting and makes you hungry for wanting to learn more about it. All in all the show is very clever, which is why it's a shame the story isn't finished. That being my only real criticism.",

The cgi animation was spot on unlike any other I've seen, I am very surprised they could pull off such remarkable fight scenes and just an overall beautiful style they twisted to making their own. I tended to relate very much so to our main character, Phos, they were a very blunt and out spoken character that tried their best to get their way not knowing it can have damaging effects (I will not go too deep into it for spoiler reasons) The other characters though I think should have a little more story put into them, theonly main ones are the diamonds, Cinnabar, and to an extinct Rutile. The music was lovely, I found to drift off whenever the lunarians theme started to play, it was absolutely a beautiful and correct choice for them to have it. Character design? A very unique choice! When I had first started watching I wanted to get every chance I could to see every gem's design as quickly as possible! Now the only complaints I do have is that it can make you feel, kinda off? When you finish watching the first season, from personal experience, and I do think there should be a little more world building. But anyways yes this anime is beautiful, I recommended to the fullest, it's definitely one I will never forget!",

Houseki no Kuni is by far one of the most interesting and unique anime i've ever seen. \r\nThe whole story and setting felt so fresh and it was the first time i have been so intrigued in an anime in ages. I was constantly trying to predict what would happen next in the show, because it seems really predictable to be honest. However, i was wrong nearly every time and the anime just continued to amaze and surprise me with it's twists throughout the story. My one downside to thisthough is that it isn't complete, and doesn't have a conclusive enough ending for me to feel satisfied. Your still left with so many questions after the anime finishes. Honestly left me with a bad taste in my mouth, and i will be reading the source material because of this.  \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fit so well with the series. Depending on if it was peaceful, if there was bad guys around, if a mystery was brewing or whatever, the soundtrack changed to fit the mood. I'm aware that all soundtracks are like this, but this one just stood out to me. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that stands out about this anime, and is probably the first thing people notice, is the art style/animation. All i can say is that is is so beautiful and amazing. The visuals in this are just stunning\\n\\n\r\nOverall I highly recommend everyone to go and watch this. I'm not sure how so many people, me included, missed this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I saw the animation and visual superlatives that are deserving on the YT channel, The Canipa Effect who does a great job covering topics about Anime community.\r\nHouseki no Kuni is my first new anime watch in over a year and I am happy to see I was quite delighted to come back to the anime way of life with this. I have learned that it also has a manga which is I will get on (what with the chances of the second season coming anytime soon being very minute).\r\nI greatly appreciated the characters being gems - Phosphophyllite being the main characters through whose 300 years'young' eyes the story of the world of greenery that is only sustainable to rocks and gems. These gems have the names accordingly and their characteristics are somewhat loosely based around those names too. The knowledge to know who these chemical compounds are, how strong their bodies are, who reacts in what way with each other and why that is. And even what happened to the world and why celestial deity looking enemies to hunt for stones repeatedly is such a fascinating aspect that is hard to completely overlook, if at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there is room for improvements in terms of the characters and how abrupt the ending of the season feels (and is) because it had to adapted from a much bigger story of the manga to a digestible anime narrative, that in no way becomes an hindrance to the enjoyment of the story, the music that elevates and compresses the emotions being conveyed and most importantly, absolutely superb 3D animation character design and the rest of world design. This anime didn't win the 2017 anime of the year award for having \"kawaii waifu material\", you know; it was because of the CGI implementation of the 3D modeling characters and editing it in a seemless manner to ensure that is there no jarring in visuals. That action adds this feeling of depth to the motion that is eerily beautiful to see an anime.\\n\\n\r\nI have heard rumbling from people that the animation of this sort decimates the visuals and the manga in general is so much better. Perhaps so, Perhaps not. All I have to ask to you is that you find some hours in your life that devote to this show and in return you'll get something much worthy of your memory.",

            "content": "Houseki no kuni starts off very inapprehensible; we're trown in a odd world with lots of strange features. But if we keep watching all our questions slowly get answered trough-out the show. it's a strange but beautiful world with rules and standards completely different from ours. \r\nThe main character is our sweet and innocent Phosphophlite/Phos who seems to be a bit of an airhead. He lives with other gems who have a daily routine of fighting of the lunarians/moonpeople who try to abduct their kind. The gems entire body exists of the gemkind corrisponding to their name and because the gems are immortal their onlyweakness seams to be breakinig. After being broken the retrieved pieces can be put back together  but with all lost  pieces they also lose a part of their memory. All gems have a \"hardness\" from 1 to 10 wich indicates how easily they break. For example Cinnabar is 3 (which makes him the most fragile of all gems) and Diamond is 10. Phos is 3.5 and due to that and the fact that he's clumsy he's prohibited to attend fights against the lunarians.\\n\\n\r\nThe gems all use he/him pronouns while their physical appearance is quite femine except for their lack of breasts. Personally i like to refer to a gem with they/them because they don't seem to have genders and they aren't human, But i will be using he/him in this review to be more clear. (This also kind of reminds me of the american cartoon 'Steven Universe' with extratterrestrial lifeforms all corrisponding to a gemkind with the same gender). The gems also seem to have romatic interest in eachother which is made clear through Dia making several comments.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Usually i really dislike anime made with this type of computerprogram (i can't recall what it's called oops, like RWBY). The movements in anime like this are usually a bit unnatural and stern BUT in houseki no kuni this ISN'T the case and i think the artstyle fits really well with the story.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD!\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, i love the lore the show has given us; flesh, bone and mind. The admirabilis (the species that inhabit the sea) are the flesh, the gems are the bone and the lunarians are the mind. The gems being bone corrsponds quite well to their physique which pleases me because at first i thought they were just this absurdly skinny due to beauty standards. This also goes for them being white.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is one of the most important things in a show in my opinion and Houseki no Kuni did a pretty good job. Phos starts off as a childish and sometimes a bit selfish. All the gems seem to dislike him and would rather dispose of him. Due to his clumsy nature and his fragility he isn't allowed to fight even though he really wants to. But despite being easiliy broken he is motivated and because of this he wants to help Cinnabar get a better job so Cinnabar wouldn't feel so useless and at the same time making HIMSELF feel less useless. Unfortunately he rather quickly finds out that being motivated isn't enough to gain victory. After losing his legs he learns there IS a way to make yourself stronger and he begins to dream of having different arms. But after losing his arms his personality changes so drastically that i feel like the entire ambiance of the show has suddenly made a 180 degree turn. \\n\\n\r\nI've also read the manga and i think the anime has done a really good job of conveying the story. Personally i prefer the anime because i had a hard time picturing the colours while reading the manga which makes the anime a lot more lively in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n(also something strange i didnt understand is that padparadscha couldnt move because there were pieces missing from her chest ; but they could have easily used some of her GINORMOUS hair just like Phosphophylite did)\\n\\n\r\nOverall i really liked Houseki no Kuni and i'd definitely recommend it to others. The story is very well made, though i think the world they live in is a tad small and not detailed in contrast to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSorry if i made any spell- or grammarmistakes, english isn't my mother language. I also probably missed a lot of important points but this is my first time reviewing an anime. Thank you for reading and i hope this is helpfull/interesting!\\n",

            "content": "Look at the premise, and you\u2019ll be curious by its setting. Gems personified as genderless beings roamed this desolate, yet frighteningly beautiful world. These \u2018gems\u2019 fight against a common cause; that is, against these so-called creatures known as \u2018lunarians\u2019 -  beings that came from the moon. Dressed in costumes reminiscence of Javanese culture, these lunarians hunt down the remaining gems \u2013 to be brought up to their home for reasons unknown. \r\nWhen the anime was first broadcasted, the ratings were utterly disappointing. Many objected the use of CGI in the show, arguing that CGI brings in low frame rate and clunky animation. However, aquick look through the first few episodes clearly shows that houseki no kuni differs a lot on that matter. The animation was smooth and the fusion of both CGI and 2D complements the heavy needed element of world building and character design. An example for the former, the rooms allocated for the gems. Each are characterized by their character. From alexandrite\u2019s room that is filled to the brim with books, to Cinnabar\u2019s melancholic, poisoned filled room.  An example for the latter, the character design for Diamond. Her hair sparkles under the feisty color of rainbow and light, which is quite a difficult process to replicate in 2D animation alone. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe brilliance of the show does not stem from the animation and the art alone, the music also plays a part in making the show intriguing and engaging. While most of the soundtrack were great, one piece of track that stood out for me the most was the soundtrack for the lunarians, \u2018sunspot\u2019. As indicative as the costume they are wearing, this soundtrack was heavily inspired by traditional Javanese music. Using the gamelan, a traditional Javanese musical instrument, this piece of soundtrack brought about a mixed sense of tranquility and dreadfulness, which often brought me to shivers every time this soundtrack is played when the lunarians appear.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art/animation and the music were outstanding on its own, the story that was being presented in this anime were enough to be on the same level, especially in terms of character development. Simply put, the anime never forgets most if not, all the characters in the show. It\u2019s easy for the anime to ignore Diamond as a character. Normally, a character would be making an appearance in one or two episodes and then afterwards disappear entirely for the rest of the season until the last episode, which will somehow introduce the character as a cameo. However, that isn\u2019t the case for the anime Houseki no kuni. The anime brings all the characters together on a journey of self-reflection and betterment of themselves. The characters will undergo different tribulation, and to see them going through the process with courage and determination is what makes the anime truly great to watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe interesting premise, the engaging art/animation, music and story blend cohesively to produce this beautiful gem of the season. This show definitely deserves a second season! \\n",

            "content": "Worth watching if only for the CG animation. \r\nHouseki no Kuni does a great job replicating the 2D anime look and feel. Sometimes it's almost impossible to tell the difference, and other times the glassy textures and reflections from the characters' jewel-colored hair makes me wonder if 2D animation could have that same stunning appeal. The many strange solid and liquid substances in the anime are a fantastic fit for the CG. They look so malleable that it looks like I could touch it.\r\nWhen the characters are in the school or roaming flowery fields, it's just fun to see them bounce off each other. Theprotagonist, Phos, is especially expressive in both animation and acting. Even when plot things start to happen, Phos somehow manages to pick herself up and brighten the mood again soon after.\\n\\n\r\nYet the show is surprisingly contemplative, more often than what the bubbly protagonist might suggest. Finding purpose in one's life is a heavy theme all throughout, and it especially matters for the jeweled girls because they're immortal. How can you live for hundreds of years without losing your sanity in silence and boredom? Find something to do, and something only you can do. For most of the girls, the main antagonistic force, the Lunarians, create that something.\\n\\n\r\nThe mysterious, alien-like Lunarians are the catalyst for most of the show's developments in character and plot, and it unfortunately works to the show's detriment. As the antagonists, they aren't interesting. They appear the same way each time, through wormholes that suddenly appear in sunny skies. They usually appear when Phos is around. The gemstone girls usually travel in pairs, so it's usually Phos and one or two or other characters that have to deal with it. Inevitably, one of them screws up, and the others have to salvage the situation and literally pick up the broken pieces. There are very few developments that aren't reactive in nature, so it feels like the characters are just waiting around for the Lunarians to show up and speed up the plot again. In-universe, the characters DO essentially just wait around for Lunarians to come and attack them, and it's kind of boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe action itself makes up for it somewhat. Since all the girls are gemstones, their body parts break away depending on their durability when they take damage. It makes combat feel more visceral when a character has to break off part of their body in order to finish off a Lunarian. There are definitely intense moments to be had watching characters struggle with their last limb; it's just a shame that there aren't more interesting enemies to fight.\\n\\n\r\nBut while the Lunarians feel like cheap plot devices, the character development they instigate is fantastic. It's quite a sight to see how far Phos grows in such a short amount of time, and from the way the season ends, it feels as if she still has room to change. Other characters have nice moments of characterization and development of their own, so if nothing else (besides the visuals), the show leaves me satisfied on the strength of its characters.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there is still the looming mystery of why the Lunarians exist at all and their relationship with the gemstones, but I highly doubt that would change my opinion on the encounters in this season. A second season or a manga reading could answer some of those questions, but the season doesn't make me interested, despite its effort.\\n\\n\r\nHouseki no Kuni is definitely unique, and I'd say it's strongest points are worth watching for. The weaker plot elements left me with a strange dissatisfaction, but not enough to regret watching it, not when there's nothing like it at the moment.",

            "content": "I came into Houseki no Kuni with zero expectations and was completely blown out of the water. I mean, a CG anime about diamond people in this day and age? What is this, waifu Steven Universe? All jokes aside, Houseki no Kuni is an absolute gem of an anime that deserves every shard of laud that comes its way. \r\nThe world of The Land of the Lustrous is mysteriously fascinating. The viewer is given very little about the world every episode and it makes you hunger for more. Who are these crystal people, why are they here, why are they sought after? Tell me more,show me more, I want more. It's a very novel universe and feels fresh among the high school isekai battle harems that are flooding the anime market at the moment and that's what makes Houseki stand out so much. \\n\\n\r\nHouseki has revitalized my interest in CG animation. We've watched shows fall apart with terribly lazy CG such as Berserk 2017 and lamented for more hand drawn remakes of such abominations. But Houseki changes the game. They didn't say \"let's just use CG characters\" they said \"how can we use CG to make our characters\" and they drew on it. The art is truly unique in the fact that they limit full CG to fight scenes and just use partial CG and normal hand animation for facial expressions to make the CG seem more natural, more anime and less jarring. It's a wonderfully new experience in my eyes and I hope other animators will continue in Houseki's art direction if they choose to use CG.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP at the end of the first episode is when I knew I had a hard on for this show. It fit so perfectly, came out of nowhere and sounds absolutely amazing. I was so excited for the rest of the series just based off of this one song. The rest of the soundtrack fits the show very well, from the operatic music of the Lunarians that are mysterious and terrifying to the many sounds of Phos, the sound direction of this show is phenomenal. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is a coming of age story and the only way to handle that is through great characterization and Houseki nails it on the head. Not only the way we see Phos grow and develop as a character but the characterization of so many different character remaining unique and memorable truly drove this show home.\\n\\n\r\nSo at this point we have an incredibly well built universe followed by a unique art style that WORKS, followed by an amazing soundtrack and voice acting topped off with incredible characterization. I'm gonna have to recommend this to any anime lover because of how phenomenal it is. Truly a hidden gem of the season.",

            "content": "Houseki no Kuni, Land of the Lustrous. The thing with an anime adaptation is usually it either transforms the original content to the best of its abilities and still barely manages to pass, or creates a new story without any critics comparing it to its source material. Houseki no Kuni is one of the unique animes that completely transform the manga into this wonderful, colourful world. \r\n[Story: 9]\r\nWith the compelling story of Lunarians (Moon people) who come down periodically to attack to abduct them and to turn them into decorations. While this may seem like an odd basis for a story, the matter is takenquite seriously. Accompanied by the intense atmosphere and beautiful visuals, the series does a wonderful job of showing the world. The show delivers the story at an amazing pace.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 8]\\n\\n\r\n The CGI was utilized to the utmost perfection. While it was low in frames, since rendering is typically the guilt of that, and I personally have had trouble rendering videos, it did not play a big role in my rating. Studio Orange was certainly not lazy about the art when they decided to use CGI, instead, it allowed them to enhance the visuals and cinematography.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 7]\\n\\n\r\nThe opening has some of the best music in the show accompanied with wonderful art, while the ed and soundtrack are nothing to brag about. Compared to the Fall 2017 season of awesome ost, this anime will probably be overlooked because of the lack of iconic music. Music is after all the international speaker in every community.\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 9]\\n\\n\r\nThis is where HnK surprisingly shines. Each character has their own quirks\\n\r\nand development. While the Mc is indeed a bit annoying at the beginning, Phos quickly became a point of empathy and relatability as the series went on. Redemption by the mc from her annoyances in the past came, like any typical Mc, but it was at a steady pace and gladly at the end was satisfying; a very good development. \\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 9]\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I wasn't bored of this series one bit ( i did binge it if that was the case), but it was immensely compelling and felt like a golden tentacle was wrapped around my foot, forcing me to click on the next episode.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 8.6]\\n\\n\r\nThough I think 8.6/10 is most fit, I could see one taking a point away if they watched it weekly. There are a lot of points that if you forgot, like about the characters, the show would have been less enjoyable, but for an anime, 12 episodes long and with CGI, it blew me away on how good it was. While this anime was certainly amazing, people typically enjoy anime that leave a hole in your heart, this wasn't one, though sad moments, it's not a finished story, thus lacks the emptiness because you are expecting more later. \\n\\n\r\nWhether you like CGI, Diamond Humans, or Fantasy plots, I would give this one a go. Whether you enjoy it in the end or not, it certainly is lustrous.",

What I mean is that everything happened in the story very, very slowly it seemed. \r\nFrom there all things broke through. The story plot was very weak. The characters were \"cookie cutter\" characters, same bodies but with different hair and eyes. No true backgrounds of any of the characters were really explored. No answers about what ishappening was actually answered. It kind of just seemed like a mess. I noticed this halfway through, but gave it a shot due to the amount of great credit this anime received from it's fans. Honestly though, it was nothing special. And I'm really disappointed by that..\\n\\n\r\nI have to say though I still admire the character creations and the initial concept.
