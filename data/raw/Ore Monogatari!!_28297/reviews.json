            "content": "There's a lot of innocence that comes with the experience of a first love, especially that which is between teenagers. Despite knowing next to nothing about the world, you're often head over heels for one another, bouncing around any idealistic hopes or plans for the future in the process. It's both adorable and sickening, and for its first few episodes, Ore Monogatari does a great job capturing that confusing mix of feelings. Then it tries to be a little bit more than that. \r\nThe most common praise of the show seems to be that isn't your typical shoujo, but I disagree\u2014it kicks off as theprotagonist, Takeo, saves a certain Yamato from being groped on the train, and then begins to follow his relationship with her. It's the modern equivalent of a prince on a white horse saving a helpless girl from a bunch of baddies, except the prince is over six feet tall and not conventionally attractive. Rounding out the two is Sunakawa, a childhood friend who reluctantly takes on the bishounen role. You can practically see the jokes coming, but that's alright; the trio has such nice chemistry together that it's easy to forget how horribly clich\u00e9 it is, and amidst the initial focus on heartwarming cuteness, it manages to paint each and every frame with an endearing stroke. \\n\\n\r\nThe best option would have been to continue down that humble path, as when it comes to reoccurring drama, thin characters don't hold up. And then it starts introducing even more to fill out its subplots. Need to shift the story to jealousy?  Don't worry, add a new character! No way out of the situation you're in? Oh, feel free to throw a relevant one in! Attempts are thankfully made to flesh these side characters out, but after happening a few times in a row, it gets tiring. The show is not concerned about Takeo and Yamato's relationship, but only the events that happen during it. There's even a few jokes about the lack of any relationship progression, but knowing the mangaka is aware of that vital flaw is far more frustrating than funny.  \\n\\n\r\nThe result of this mess is that you're left with more questions each episode. Will Takeo and Yamato ever advance beyond the stage of handholding and throwing around \"I love you\" like it's going out of style? How are the two managing to stick together in their current state? Who is Sunakawa as a character, and why do we know next to nothing about him? I'd hope at least one of these is answered by the end of its run, but it's hard to have expectations of something so stubborn. I have to wonder if it was written with romance in mind, since it works even better as a mystery. \\n\\n\r\nCombined with an ever-declining animation quality and audio so unobtrusive it seems silent,  Ore Monogatari is more of a weekly chore than it is entertainment. You wouldn't be wrong to call it \"Nisekoi without the harem\" (probably why the crossover manga between the two exists), which basically alludes to \"nothing\". It's surprisingly hard to criticize for paragraph upon paragraph without venturing into simple complaints, since the lack of progression doesn't give much material to write about. So while the anime does showcase the directorial prowess of Morio Asaka, visual gags and all, it isn't enough to save the aimless property from the clutches of mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nYou're much better off watching Chihayafuru, which displays the talent of roughly the same staff far more accurately.",

            "content": "Love? It's always stupid. Noting more than a mere faction of genuine feelings and yet, we learn to explore what is love? even we are the one who will break down sooner or later. \r\nStory \r\nThe story is about Takeo Gouda, a first-year high school student. Whose life up until now has been full of bromance. Since despite being unpopular with girls, Takeo has always been fully respected by most of the male characters in the series. They acknowledge him as the best person. They even idolize him. While on the other hand, Takeo's best friend Suna, is undoubtedly popular with girls. All of thefemale characters regardless of age fell in love with Suna. That includes mothers, high school student girls, kindergarten kids and even widows. The story continues with an interesting scene in which Rinko Yamato is nearly being molested inside the train. Now, what will our main character do? \\n\\n\r\nOh God! Takeo God mode is activated, everyone! Run for your life! \\n\r\nCrawl if you need to! Scream if you want to! It\u2019s solely to save your life!\\n\\n\r\nThus, thanks for the molester; we can see a glimpse of what God of Rage can look like. What a truly moment to be experienced. \\n\\n\r\nPoor molester... this hilarious moment turns to heart-wrenching moment, because that molester never ever be seen or heard again\u2026.  Let\u2019s all just assume that he is dead. That\u2019s even better. Now, let\u2019s all said \u201cOwaaaa\u201d as of parting gift for him. Owaaaa! \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\r\nI\u2019ll admit, the art of the characters is little weird. Even when surfing half way of the series, it\u2019s still weird. I mean, those eye lashers are kind of exaggerated. However, it is also one of a flashing scene to see. Well, the idea is new and I\u2019ve never seen one like this before, so it\u2019s a fresh scene to see once in a while. The animation is certainly not a masterpiece level but definitely above of the average. I\u2019ve got to say; at least this series animation is not some well made cheap animation. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe Op and Ed is bringing up such a pleasant atmosphere. It\u2019s obvious that the Op is lovely and slowly capturing all the beholders attention.  Freaking sweet, nothing is more than worth for the series. The vanilla and cream could be more unique than what you may think. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nOne of interesting aspect, all the characters in the series is not your typical character. The love rival, neither friend nor the parents, all of them does has unique traits that fun to be explored. They stand out in their own class without following any other characters we\u2019ve ever seen. The concept of generic and typical clearly has been thrown out. The pace slowly builds up and before we even know, the relationship among all of them is already beautiful in a way. Our effort as we wait patiently to see how this series will be going is paid off. All the matters, we also cherish all those happily moments. In a moment, we can know that Takeo is seriously slow when it\u2019s about the love and feeling but he is not your dense type of characters. \u201cI will never understand if you doesn\u2019t tell me\u201d - Takeo. Hearing those words, we know that he is powerless no matter how strong he can be on physically and mentally but at least he try to understand what\u2019s the problem and the difficulties. He tries to help and solve it by any ways, if it\u2019s mean the happiness for both his friends and girlfriend. Even, if he is the one who will eventually hurt. Takeo, not a badass, warrior nor a hero, he just a type of person who will treasure what\u2019s the most important to him. That\u2019s more than suffice. And in the end, Takeo earns the right to achieve all the happiness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall and Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\n\u201cSometimes people are beautiful. Not in looks. Not in what they say. Just in what they are\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe quote amazingly suited in portraying the whole series. It\u2019s such a beautiful love story in a way. Rather than more of those sweet and sad moments together, they created an inspiring love that bloomed within people hearts. They don\u2019t try to make the series melodramatic, rather, they just let us explored all of the characters freely until we all love them. In a sense, it\u2019s more than meet the eyes. As behalf of my honest opinion, I must say I\u2019ve got a fun ride watching the series until the end. Because love cannot be simplified described as neither words nor actions but more, it\u2019s the purely feeling of two hearts. Tied up by a mysterious red of strings, all the characters, story and pace has been bind up altogether into a hilarious yet lovely moments.\\n",

            "content": "Ore Monogatari!!, also known as My Love Story, is exactly what it sounds like. It\u2019s a story about love between two main characters \u2013 Takeo and Yamato. And at first glance, they look like a mismatch. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to realize as the two looks nothing alike. Takeo looks like a professional sumo wrestler standing nearly 7 feet tall while Yamato has the appearance of a frail schoolgirl. However, the story is more than just about appearances. Because in this love story, destiny connects them in ways that really gives the word \u2018love\u2019 its important meaning.\r\nWritten and crafted by Kazune Kawahara, the seriesis what I consider a classic for the rom-com genre. An interesting catch though is that there isn\u2019t a love triangle between two main guys fighting for a girl. In fact, we have Sunakawa Makoto, a very popular guy who seems to attract almost any girl. The catch is that he is more like the antithesis of a playboy. He doesn\u2019t have any interest in getting a girlfriend but actually devotes his time to help his friend Takeo experience love. Get the general picture? It sets up the primary story that connects Takeo with other characters instead of a drama clingy series. And throughout the way, he becomes part of a love story that changes his life forever.\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes easily establishes a lot of facts about the main characters. Takeo has the outer appearance of someone that would make almost any girl frighten in fear. However, he is a guy with a heart of gold. His action speaks louder than words as he is dedicated to help others; friends, family, or even strangers. Then, there\u2019s Yamato, a sweet innocent girl who falls for Takeo at first sight after he saves her on the train from an apparent pervert. The series approaches this concept with careful planning as the first episodes builds on the chemistry between the two. Makoto supports them from behind the lines while offering helpful advice. What I find interesting about the initial setup is how Takeo will learn about love. Clearly, he lacks experience when it comes to relationships. These include going on dates, setting up the right moments, or initiating a first kiss. His outer appearance also doesn\u2019t help the fact that he is often misjudged. Yet, the show does a very clever job with fleshing out the characters. Through flashbacks and characterization, we see how Takeo\u2019s personality really is like when he was little. The show also can be persuasive when it comes to letting the audience know why others changes their view on Takeo as the story progresses. A crystal clear way of presenting the story is something that isn\u2019t done so easily with directing but for Ore Monogatari, it knows its ways.\\n\\n\r\nAs relationship dynamics is a primary focus in the show, it\u2019s also risky when the story already sets up the main characters as the couple. No, forget set up. How about just bringing them together in union? While the pacing seems a bit abrupt at first, I can honestly say that the show does an appealing job to show their progress as a couple. This is because other characters are introduced to bring out the best of them together. For instance, there\u2019s Ai, Makoto older sister. While she may seem like a love rival at first, the show quickly makes it clear that the only eyes Takeo has for is Yamato. It shows that he is loyal with his commitments and often tries to prove himself as a worthy boyfriend. Many times throughout the show, Takeo appeals to others (including Ai) for advice. These include reading girls magazines, learning to cook, and even trying to very comically to practice kissing with a friend. We also get a good idea that Takeo wants to be with Yamato both physically and emotionally. As he lacks experience in love, the show inspires ways for Takeo to become better person. This is connected by the relationship Takeo shares with Yamato, Makoto, Ai, and more characters later on. \\n\\n\r\nAs sweet as the show can be, one might question about the pacing of the series. How does Ore Monogatari formulate into a 2 cour series about a couple that becomes official at so early in the stage? I had some doubts at first about this and it can be understandable if some people feels that the show can be repetitive. Almost every episode feels similar as it focuses on Takeo and Yamato. Hardly any other character becomes the main focus although they do have some roles, whether major or minor. It can also be frustrating sometimes to see how dense Takeo is when taking the initiative that involves what couples should be doing (ex. Holding hands, kissing, etc). In essence, a show like this often puts the couple ahead of others but it isn\u2019t entirely shy to give some supporting characters their own spotlights. Characters such as Saijou and Nanako gets their own exclusive episode while Ai also her spotlight moments with Takeo. In essence, it\u2019ll take patience to watch the show. Luckily, there\u2019s comedy that factors into entertainment. Rather than relying on dirty fan service or shock value, the show has a charming presence of delivering humor. The main part of it comes from the couple of Takeo and Yamato as they show human expressions that you would typically see in any rom-com. Then, there\u2019s also Takeo as he accomplishes nearly inhuman feats because of his impressive physique. Similarly, Makoto and Takeo\u2019s relationship can also get quite comedic because of the latter\u2019s occasional lack in common sense. If you want comedy, then there\u2019s a performance that will get you smiling.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse adapts the manga with its production and to be quite honest, it\u2019s gorgeous. The color palette like background and character designs illustrates the classic feel of what a rom-com shoujo should be. Character designer Hamada Kunihiko (Nana, Chihayafuru) puts emphasis on the characters\u2019 youthful looks to give them their appeal. Of course, Takeo stands out as the most prominent figure in the show. He is designed to look like a professional sumo wrestler who stands out taller and more ripped than anyone in the show. Yamato has the innocent look of a flower while the Sunakawa siblings are designed to look like beauties. It creates a surge of diversity with the main cast that people can feel attached to. And speaking of diversity, the show also ventures to other settings besides school such as the outdoor woods and beach. Lastly, the show\u2019s fan service isn\u2019t relied on showing skin despite having the classic beach episode. Instead, it further progresses the relationship between Takeo and Yamato. From a humorous perspective, the character reactions is what really brings out the entertainment values that fans may crave for.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is fairly decorative although not outstanding. The OST and OP theme songs are neat for their ability to portray the style of the show. But what may stands out more is the character voice mannerisms. Takeo\u2019s voice sounds like he is a lot older than he appears to be while Yamato is the opposite. She has a soft voice that really shows her innocence. The Sunakawa siblings both have a more mature voice in particular Ai as she is portrayed as the older sister type. So what does this mean? It basically shows that the characters are realistic to their appearance and roles. \\n\r\nNo, I wouldn\u2019t say Ore Monogatari is a show that will be bucketing tears. There\u2019s no tragic moments that makes the audience feel like there\u2019s a need to cry. Instead, we get a classic shoujo rom-com with affectionate character relationships. Even the love triangles that occasionally appears in the show doesn\u2019t go into a direction that gets distracting. And while the pacing will feel a bit repetitive, it\u2019s also important to realize the objective of Ore Monogatari!!: to tell a love story with charm, elegance, realism, and developing youth. And that is a certain kind of beautiful.",

            "content": "I watched Ore Monogatari after seeing lots of good reviews about it. Especially because they said that it's \"really good\" and \"unique\", but watching this anime made me VERY disappointed.\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nI would've given it a higher score if it wasn't a 24 episodes anime. Why? Because this anime is mostly about \"nothing\". Lots of people said that it's unique but I don't see anything unique about it. It started off like this: Guy saves the girl, they started to meet a lot.\r\nSo the rest of the series went on like this: Meet (there are flowers and bubbles every time they meet), lovey-dovey, meet,lovey-dovey,petty problem,meet,lovey-dovey,petty problem,meet-lovey-dovey,petty problem. Imagine 21 episodes of nothing but the same things over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is the only thing that I like in this anime because it's so pretty.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are not that really interesting for me, so I often skip them. The were also lots of times where a scene became even more boring because of the background music that's playing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nTakeo - There are lots of anime where the male lead is not handsome so Takeo is not the \"first\". The only difference  is that, he is \"obviously\" very ugly and bigger compared to most of the characters. They said that, \"even though he is ugly at least he is kind\". But then in this anime, Takeo is not the only kind person. Almost everyone is kind. Even that handsome Suna is kind. So, what makes Takeo great compared to them?\\n\\n\r\nYamato - is the usual shoujo female lead. Cute,Tiny ( TOO tiny for Takeo which really bothers me a lot), she looks fragile but at least she knew how to make a move on the guy that she like without making herself looks like a flirt. There is nothing interesting about her, some female characters are even more interesting than her.\\n\\n\r\nSunakawa- The complete opposite of Takeo. He is handsome and popular, but even though he is handsome he didn't act like a bad person. I admire his character a lot. He is such a good friend. But then, I thought that there will be something more to him. Something to look forward to, but none of that happened since this anime focused on Takeo and Yamato's relationship.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\nI almost want to dropped it after 7 episodes.  Because that 7 episodes almost bored me to death, but I have a policy not to drop any anime so I had to bear with it. It would've been okay if it's only 12 episodes.",

            "content": "So Ore Monogatari!! has come to an end. To be honest, I want to say firstly. Thank you Madhouse for bringing another Romance on the table. If I remember correctly they made Chihayafuru, which also had the same little picky artstyle for this series. As expected, Madhouse delivers as the usual an adaptation fairly from the manga and correctly, however one question comes into the mind of people... is this show worth a watch? Well lets begin.\r\nStory: Well pretty much the story is simple to explain. Our main protagonist Takeo Gouda, who has a friend named Suna, one day saw a girl getting some sortof touch by a pervert, he defends the girl and saves her from him, and thats when pretty much the start of so called love at first sight begins. Now for starters, the show to my eyes barely does cliche stuff. Barely, I actually give props to the actual author for the series first for this, because the romance felt for the most part uncliche, and very nice looking. However the only issue I have for this series are a couple of things here and there. For one thing lets talk about the dialogue in this show. The dialogue may be considered as repetitive, and the second thing being inconsistent. By inconsistent I mean the comedy itself seems very lackluster and limited, and most of the time they use the same words for the entirety of the show. I honestly don't mind the dialogue being repetitive, but when you get the words like \"Tsuki-da!\" by Takeo every second, at first you don't mind but then it gets annoying. The dialogue is limited by one sentence and the repetition of words (also known as the one liners) for a lot of times in the anime series, which affects the show as well. The other problem when I said about consistencies of the comedy, it also repeats the sequence of its humour, at firs it seems funny, but then it doesn't. Its more like it slowly decreases that enjoyment based on the humor aspects, which It gets very jarring and at the same time it feels boring. The second thing I have to say for the series is that the story itself kind of lost its way a bit what made it special. By that I mean the relationship for me feels a bit lacking on some sort of places. But of course the anime does its job to slowly progress or build up the relationship for the main cast but it seems a little bit of the spark was left away a bit. Overall, lets say the story itself is mediocre. The few things I would say the good parts of the anime beside the most of the time romance progression would be the little bit of stories that helped to spice up a bit. It also puts the whole \"Don't judge someone by the outside, judge them by the inside\" message quite well, since this actually happens a couple of times in the anime series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters would be considered as component of average cast. The main cast of characters are for the most part the main focus of the story itself. But for the most most part, would be the focus of our two couples. Takeo and Yamato. \\n\\n\r\nTakeo Gouda being the main protagonist of the show can be considered a lot of things. Smart, Brave, Helpful, Friendly. Though he may seem ugly or looking like a 30 year old person on the outside (considering thats how he looks like to my perception) but he's a character that knows how to help people out. His relationship with Yamato, however, as I said before, at times it seems a little lacking. Its not a bad relationship with her its just for me it feels a bit like a lacking of spice in a bit of areas. Overall I think hes more so a passable character.\\n\\n\r\nYamato, the female lead character would be one of the few weaker components, considering for me as a person I think her character was not fully fleshed out, she needed a bit more of a pizzas to be exact, to let her become memorable. The only thing I can think from her are a few things: she likes to cook pastries, and she loves Takeo. She's also caring, helpful, friendly, nervous at times. She's not a terrible character, but she's not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nLastly Suna, who he for me was one of the fewer characters that kind of moved to the side a bit after the second half. At first he had a slight development between him and Takeo, when they showed backstories from the two of them and of course how they became friends and all, that was pretty nice to put so we can see the bonds of the bromance, however, due to the relationship between Yamato and Takeo growing, he seems a bit irrelevant in some cases of the story, feeling very much lacking on presence to my eyes at times.\\n\\n\r\nFor the side characters, a few of them took a role around the cast, but a few were only shown once and never to be seen again. As well with a couple that appeared more than once and got bit of development. The supporting cast may be big but of course thats a big issue.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Remember when I said that the artstyle was like Chihayafuru? well the artstyle for Ore Monogatari gave me the exact same view when I watched that show. It just feels nice to see the artstyle again because for me it fits very well with its characters, of course as well lets talk about overall art. The art isn't that great as it does suffer a couple of inconsistencies through the series. However they do manage to keep consistent with the far frame and of course the faces, they make the faces look adorable enough. The background at times seems very standard but when it comes at times for memorable moments or the beautiful moments between the two characters it gives more of a spring feel to it, and a very atmospheric one as well. For the animation would be alright to be honest. It does seem a bit choppy at times but not too groundbreaking.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: The music can be entitled into one sentence. \"Calming\". Yes. Calming at times, and very beautiful when it comes to the moments in their relationship. As well with a couple of soundtracks that makes them memorable to my eyes. Note that memorable doesn't mean masterpiece to be honest. In the sound department they sometimes nail the presentation of the sound right, but at times (a bit) seems very hard to listen to. Of course, thats just me. I also have to say that the Opening and the Ending are well fitting for the show. Especially the ending song.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even with the flaws of the series, at times I do have to say the show did deliver at times scenes that makes me giggle, and at times that makes me laugh. It just went a bit toned down after the second half for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nA decent show to watch, of course, its just a little special in a matter of progression, but to me it lost a bit its way. The main cast is passable while the supporting might be lacking, the art is good enough and same with the music. Its a show that could be a hit or a miss for anyone.",

Romance\r\n2. Comedy\r\n3. Shoujo.... yep oh wait? girls? das right people, this series demographics are not aimed to make your wittle willy hard.\r\nNOT THIS:\r\n1. Drama\r\n2. Boobs\r\n3. Action of ANY kind.\r\n4. Fantasy of ANY kind.\r\n5. Slice of Life (yep its not a slice oflife and is therefore not bound by any of that genres characteristics)\\n\r\n6.

Practically anything that isen't Comedic or Romantic.\\n\\n\r\nNow that is a very broad spectrum, but how can any sane individual criticise ANYTHING for something they we're NOT promised? I mean, yep i would be kinda pissed if wateched the new Star Wars movie and it didn't contain dope ass lightsaber fights, but i would'nt criticize it for not including a romance or gollum from LOTR (hint: because that was never promised to begin with).\\n\\n\r\nSo, all this aside... it's pretty good, made me feel good and made me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nIt can be lacking in plot and at times is a little slow, but i'm a dude so what do i know, there could be a ton of \"hints\" in there that i didn't catch... like i never do with the ladies but whatevs.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 9, because it was great, although still far from a masterpiece.",

I love how he genuinely values the people he is surrounded by and only wants the best for each of them. Suna's laugh makes me smile and watching him reminisce and see how much he values his friendship with Takeo is so heart warming. I adore Yamato and how much she adores Takeo.

An unpopular guy amongst girls, who's not bullied every waking existence, saves a girl from a train molester and gets her number. His dense mindset towards the girl's feelings was funny and corny at the same time, but was understandable because of the backstory we had been given. When he eventually understands her feelings they finally start dating and this is when the fun stuff begins...\r\nOr so I had hoped.\r\nI should have just dropped it then and there because after finding out that they both likeeach other, they basically become lampposts that moths hover around. Everything happens just because one or both of them exist. Their relationship never changes and is basically set in stone from that point on. So the focus then shifts to other people and their relationships but it's executed quite boringly. When the focus is back onto their relationship you can always expect Takeo to misunderstand, overreact or \"SUKI DA\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nIt felt a bit like it was a children's anime in that the backgrounds were just very bright, watercoloured and simple.

            "content": "Okay, now that I've seen all the episodes, I can finally write a review about this extremely lovable anime, even though I've never written a review before. I am absolutely smitten with this anime. \r\nLet me elaborate.\r\nWARNING: THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS SO PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE ENTIRE THING.\r\nThis anime tells a love story, obviously, as the title says. Our main character is Gouda Takeo, a 2-meter tall, muscular, even a bit scary-looking high school freshman who doesn't look his age by any means. Despite his scary appearance, he's good-hearted, energetic, always willing to help out anyone in need, which earnsrespect from his classmates and also other girls (which he is painfully unaware of). Then there's his love interest, a teeny-tiny petite shy girl named Yamato Rinko, who is really into baking cookies, helping out others in need, basically, she's just as pure-hearted as Takeo. Their love story begins when Takeo saves Yamato from a groper while on the same train. The two fall in love on first sight, although Takeo has a hard time believing she really does like him, due to his unusual appearance and girls' tendencies to dislike guys like him. Which is, frankly, so damn adorable. Takeo is not your usual anime dude. Even though he posesses superhuman strength and is adored by absolutely everyone who gets to know him, he is super modest and a little bit insecure. He also respects Yamato a great deal, going so far as having trouble calling her by her first name, being super nervous about holding her hand, promising not to even lay a finger on her until she wants him to. She, on the other hand, is embarassed by having occasional dirty thoughts about him, gets super excited about holding his hand, is amazed by his strength, always cheers for him, and so on. The contrast between the two (she's super-tiny and delicate while he's an awkward giant) is SO. DAMN. ADORABLE. Their relationship is SO. DAMN. ADORABLE. The story is SO. DAMN. ADORABLE. even though it revolves mostly around their lovey-dovey encounters ('Takeo-kun, I love you so much!', 'Aaaah, Yamato, I love you too!' and so on and so forth). It's SO FREAKING ADORABLE that I don't even give a damn about the story not being as developed as you'd expect it to be (hence why I gave it a 9 instead of a 10). \\n\r\nThough I must say, I really applaud the development in the latest episodes, and the small hardship the two faced (not gonna spoil it. But it's a happy ending, of course.)\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the reason why I liked this anime so freaking much is because I'm in a relationship with a guy similar to Takeo... and we're kinda like Takeo and Yamato... so it hits too hard home. Oh well. :D\\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is really crisp, the colors are nice, the backgrounds are nice, basically there's nothing to dislike. The whole thing is very fresh-looking. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't as offputting as you'd expect your typical shojo anime soundtrack to be. The opening song was actually really nice, I'd sit through the opening humming along to it, which is what I never ever do (when I watch anime I usually skip openings, except if I really like the song). Whoever sings the opening and ending songs did a great job, their voice is really gentle and nice, and not making me want to stab my eardrums with a fork until they bleed. Background music during the episodes is also enjoyable, there's not a single thing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6\\n\r\nWhile I absolutely adore Takeo and Yamato, I found myself wanting to punch the writers in the face for not showing basically any background story relating to Takeo's best friend, Sunakawa-kun. Sunakawa-kun is your typical bishounen on the outside, extremely gorgeous, but very quiet and mysterious on the inside. But we don't find out anything about why is he like that. We don't know why doesn't he pursue girls (other than disliking them for talking shit about Takeo behind his back) and why is he always so distant. He has no other significance in the anime other than being around Takeo, helping out Takeo 'n shit... everything is always revolving around Takeo. I was hoping Sunakawa-kun would find a girlfriend by the end of the series, but I ended up being disappointed. The girl who showed up as a potential love interest for him ended up being turned down for no apparent reason even though she might be a good match for him. AND WE DIDN'T EVEN GET ANY DEEPER EXPLANATION AS TO WHY WOULD HE REJECT HER, WHY IS HE ALWAYS LIKE THAT. I was so, so, so disappointed. Also, Sunakawa-kun's sister... and the guy who's interested in her (Oda-kun)... very little to no development at all. The plot revolves way too much around Takeo for my liking and doesn't give space to other characters and their development. Which made me really sad and disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 10/10\\n\r\nEven despite the aforementioned flaws in character development, I really enjoyed this anime, as I've stated before. It's not your typical shojo anime, it's crisp, enjoyable, and it's definitely worth a shot if you want to watch something light and cheerful without any deeper story to it. For all of you out there who like adorable love stories but with a slightly different charm to it, without a lot of shojo cliches, you could really enjoy this anime. I absolutely recommend it. ^^\\n\\n\r\nHope this review was helpful enough. Cheers!",

            "content": "Want an anime to make you smile even when you\u2019re feeling down? Want something that makes you ahh at its sweetness and purity? And most of all, something that makes you think, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I have relationships like this?\u201d\r\nJoin Gouda Takeo on his incredibly heart-warming journey to find true love, experience high school struggles, and aid everyone who ever meets him by doing as many good deeds as he possibly can. If there\u2019s a cat stuck in a tree, Takeo will rescue it. If a child falls into a river, Takeo will jump in. If a friend wants to confess to his crush, Takeo willhelp him arrange it.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it\u2019s not the deeds Takeo does that make him such a likeable character. It\u2019s the way he\u2019s presented. The description \u2018big heart\u2019 fits him perfectly. He\u2019s pure, kind and just good. He\u2019s the type of friend who will always help you without even thinking twice about it, even turning a simple thought or wish expressed into an action in order to make the person expressing the thought happy. And although he can be a bit dense at times, if you explain things to him he will take pains to remember them and act upon them in the future.\\n\\n\r\nWhat then, is the catch? Well this should be obvious from looking at the cover. He\u2019s not conventionally good looking. And because of this, no girl is able to recognize his good character until the female protagonist from the story comes along. Luckily she ends up being less shallow than every other girl that has existed up until this point, and thus we have our story.\\n\\n\r\nThis girl though, Yamato Rinko, is really something in herself. She\u2019s just as pure, kind and sweet as Takeo (with the addition of being shyer and somewhat smarter). This essentially creates many scenes filled with what we colloquially name \u2018fluff\u2019 \u2013 that is to say, adorably sweet scenes in which the characters radiate such happiness that you can\u2019t help but smile. They don\u2019t even have to be doing much (and often they really don't do much), just chatting or something and you\u2019ll still enjoy watching them. Although an exaggeration of a normal relationship, most people would probably view something similar to this \u2013 with their mutual love, respect and acceptance \u2013 as relationship goals. \\n\r\nTheir relationship progression does slow down as the series goes on, but although that's a little irritating it actually fits in with the characters' personalities and how you'd expect them to behave.\\n\\n\r\nI will note here that if you binge watch this show in a couple of sessions or less it might end up being sickly sweet and a bit of a turn-off, because it is after all comprised of many episodes very similar in content. Rather, if you just watch a couple of episodes every now and then it will stay fresh and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nNow we turn to the third protagonist, the \u2018best friend\u2019 character. Sunakawa\u2019s character is also portrayed remarkably well, as a character who often appears apathetic and emotionless but shows his real feelings through what he does, rather than what he says. His looks are on the opposite end of the spectrum to Takeo\u2019s, and this is a recurring theme in the series, but the parts where he appears mainly highlight how caring and loyal a friend he is to Takeo (and by extension Yamato). It\u2019s almost impossible not to wish you had a friend like him. In addition, he is actually developed quite well as a character by himself, and piques a lot of interest. Issues concerning him are resolved well and realistically, in particular his family drama. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting cast, watching them is hugely enjoyable too. Each of them brings something to the story and helps it develop, although they are mainly used as a catalyst for the main romance. None of the characters are obnoxious, all of them are quite pleasant and a lot of them are given decent backstory which helps flesh out their characters. There is an entire set of episodes dedicated to Sunakawa's sister that creates an interesting little diversion from Takeo and Yamato.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and Ending themes were a good fit for the story. They matched the overall tone perfectly, with the light and cheerful music. The Seiyuus were talented (my only complaint here was the incredible high pitch used for Yamato which seemed a tad unrealistic for a 16 year old girl, although I guess it\u2019s more common in Japan) and the rest of the music was easy on the ears.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and animation were lovely. They were attractive (with a lot of pastel tones being used), and the high concentration of flowery and sparkly effects went together so well with the characters' reactions.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose I haven\u2019t really covered the plot, but then again there\u2019s not much to say about it. It\u2019s a story of how a romance buds and develops, and however well done it is, that is essentially the full story. Oh well. I\u2019ll just use this as an example of how an anime doesn\u2019t need a focussed plot to be good.\\n\\n\r\nNow to conclude. I thought this anime was great, and personally connected to some of the characters and events portrayed on an intrinsic level. The lack of focussed plot did prevent me from giving it a higher score, because, sweet as their relationship was, I would have loved to see them take it a little further in the amount of episodes that had been allocated. \\n\\n\r\nIt was still a really enjoyable, really fun watch, though, and one I would most definitely recommend to any fan whatsoever of the romance genre. \ud83d\ude0a\\n",

            "content": "Gouda Takeo is an unusually large freshman in high school. He's large and muscular and not conventionally attractive, but he's a teddy bear on the inside. His closest friend is Sunakawa Makoto, an introverted bishounen who is basically the polar opposite of Takeo. One day Takeo notices a girl being groped on a train, and he saves her. She falls in love with both his good moral character and appearance instantly, and he falls for her as well. The two of them begin a romantic journey together. \r\nOre Monogatari!! stands out from other romantic comedies largely because of its unattractive male lead. Most shoujo romancesfeature delicate bishounen who bear more resemblance to Suna, and \"ugly\" characters like Takeo are usually portrayed as disgusting stalker otaku. The series also defies stereotypes when Suna manages to clear up all the clich\u00e9 misunderstandings in just one episode and ultimately gets Yamato and Takeo to confess to each other. In this regard, Ore Monogatari!! is revolutionary. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing Ore Monogatari!! does very well is portraying friendship between guys. Typical shoujo often ignore the friendships between male friends, so it's refreshing and heart-warming to see the \"bro\" relationship between Takeo and Suna, as well as between Takeo and his other friends. Suna is, without a doubt, the best character in this series. I can honestly say that I watched this show almost entirely for him. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Ore Monogatari!! has some substantial flaws. While it has a unique premise, its comedy becomes overused quickly. While I enjoyed the comedy once a week, it would be tiresome to watch in one sitting. To reference a MAL review, most jokes have to do with Takeo's size, Suna's appearance, Takeo and Suna's unlikely friendship, or Takeo and Yamato's innocence. The jokes are repetitive, and nothing really new is brought to the comedy spectrum. \\n\\n\r\nThe other big issue with Ore Monogatari!! is that there are no real problems in Takeo and Yamato's relationship. They both have insecurities, sure, but those insecurities are dealt with quickly so that the two can return to fluff. The only really significant insecurity comes right at the end of the series, and it's given barely any time to develop. A resolution is shoved in our faces with very little time left in the series, and as a result, there is no time for the characters to undergo any development with this final trial. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it certainly is true that Ore Monogatari!! distinguishes itself from other shoujo by clearing up the misunderstandings within three episodes, there's a reason clich\u00e9 shoujo drag out romance so much: it provides a goal for the series. Other successful shoujo romance anime like Kimi ni Todoke, Lovely Complex, and Kaichou wa Maid-sama!, which I might add were all two-cour series, took a lot longer for the romance to develop. While it was frustrating at times, it provided viewers with something to look forward to. On the other hand, the entirety of Ore Monogatari!! starting from episode 3 is in the couple's honeymoon phase, and we don't get to see the realistic, less pretty side of relationships. All we get from them is \"Takeo-kun, daisuki!\" and \"SUKI DA!!!\". Despite Takeo and Yamato liking each other, there's so much they have yet to learn about one another. There's so much they may not agree on, yet we haven't seen any of it. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the story, there are a few other things to consider. The art is prety good, and it does a good job emphasizing just how different Yamato, Takeo and Suna are. The reaction scenes (especially Suna's) are done really well. The soundtrack of the series is pretty, and complements romantic moments well. It chimes in at the right moments. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its flaws I mentioned above, I really enjoyed this anime. Maybe that sounds hypocritical now, but I really did like it. It addresses not only romance but also platonic friendships, difficult family situations, and even introducing a new life into the world! But like I said earlier, I don't think I could stomach watching it in one sitting. The overused jokes and fluff are nice once a week, but not if you're trying to marathon the show. The lack of real issues is frustrating. The sheer length of Ore Monogatari!! was its greatest flaw, and I believe it would have been a lot more successful as a one-cour series. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 7 \\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 6 \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 \\n\r\nOverall score: 6/10 \\n\r\nDo I recommend it? YES! (Just take breaks every now and then)",

            "content": "Shoujo romance has been very formulaic as of late.  You either have the perfect boy with the perfect features or what have you, falling or trying to woo over the inadequate or least popular girl in the entire school, or you have a pair of adorable people who for love of all that is good and holy don't even confess to each other AT ALL.  So, we have a predicament here.  We have a shoujo romance that has neither of those things as its base story line so...what do we do with Ore Monogatari then?\r\nStory: Gouda Takeo is a first year high-schooler.Known by many of the people at school as a VERY large individual (about 6'4\" in height), all Takeo ever wanted, was to get a girl to like him back.  Throughout the years through no fault of his own, Takeo has always been unable to confess to the girls he likes because of his unintentionally suave friend, Makoto Sunakawa.  So, after going into high school and saving a girl from a groper on a train, he meets the lovely (and ridiculously tiny) girl, Rinko Yamato, and thus a new crush begins.  \\n\\n\r\nOre Monogatari plays a lot like your general shoujo romance slice of life comedy show.  (Wow that is a lot of genres)  Unlike a good number of shoujo romance where the main couple ALMOST reaches the point where they can maybe sorta want to kind of perhaps date each other, Ore Monogatari puts the majority of its runtime straight into the \"these people are actually dating\" category since post episode three, the main characters in the series actually do get together and begin dating each other, which is nice.  However post the confession, what do we have?  Well, we have various things, actually.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from spending time with our main couple and showcasing that this show did indeed put two people together to the extent and comfort level that they can hold hands, kiss, have all sorts of lovey dovey moments, the show also focuses on essentially, building up on that.  Every few episodes, they add in a new shoujo romance trope in order to \"test\" their love, so to speak.  These include the standard things like, acceptance from spouse's friends, love rivals, spending time alone, more love rivals, and finally, a love rival for the other side.  (Yeah, lot of love rivals.)  As such, Ore Monogatari doesn't really part ways from the standard \"Shoujo tropes\" that it comes from.  Sure there are a couple episodes and even an entire section that are not devoted entirely to the main couple, but in comparison, those mini side stories don't hold as much value as the original story.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Ore Monogatari is admittedly a very sweet anime with a very odd looking couple.  It ends on a gentle slope so there're really no issues there, but the show didn't try to differ itself from traditional shoujo aside from its \"beauty and the beast\" motif with the characters' various heights.  A lot of it was still stuff you see from a generic shoujo and it didn't really try and differ itself a lot in that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Interesting main couple\\n\r\n+ Actual progression in the relationship\\n\r\n-  Most of the story was similar and/or bland\\n\r\n-  Story played off like a normal shoujo romance\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in Ore Monogatari take up two different camps.  The main characters, and everyone else.  \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with our main protagonist, Gouda Takeo.  Takeo, as mentioned before, is a very large human.  He is big, he is strong, he can somehow move faster than a motor vehicle, and he's too nice to people to the extent that he won't consider his own feelings before someone else's.  (Also, he's kind of dense.)  He's like a big teddy bear and he wants to be helpful to everyone as much as he possibly can.  As the series goes on, we get to see Takeo change as he grows to truly treasure his girlfriend Rinko and values their relationship immensely, mostly with the phrase \"I love her\", which is basically said about every 30 seconds whenever he's on screen, which I hate.  One particular thing about the main couple is the fact that their entire personality can sort of be described by their catchphrase.  For Takeo, it's \"I love her\", which tells you that well, he loves her and wants her to be happy.  \\n\\n\r\nThen we have Rinko Yamato, Takeo's fun-sized girlfriend who has an addiction to making cakes.  As a character, Rinko is a very enthusiastic girl.  Particularly, she is very enthusiastic by trying to make Takeo happy as every 30 seconds she spouts out \"Takeo's so cool!\" and other synonyms to that.  In comparison, Yamato doesn't really have the growth that Takeo has, though putting one without the other is like taking strawberries out of shortcake.  The issue I have is that as a character, Rinko doesn't stand out as an individual person, mostly because her defining traits are making sweets, and loving Takeo, and that's about it.  She can't stand by herself as an individual character, and as such, really puts a sour taste to this supposedly really sweet story.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, Makoto Sunakawa, the pretty boy that HAS to exist in every shoujo ever.  Sunakawa is the pinnacle of the perfect \"bro\" character.  Able to see what is happening in any situation including aiding the baka couple that he hangs out with often, Suna acts behind the scenes in any given moment in the anime and tries to help Takeo especially with his love, acting more like a support than anything.  Suna is always the calm one in any frenzy, is always the one to drag Takeo back to earth, and is always there to help with any issues that his friend has, looking out for him like a good older brother figure of sorts.  The issue I have is the fact that the show treats him as the anchor to the relationship and doesn't really expand him out all that much.  They do devote a couple episodes to him, but only really one TRULY focuses on him, and even so, doesn't really explain much to me about him as a character.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters in Ore Monogatari act as friends or family of either of the three main characters.  For the most part, these side characters serve to add the conflict to the story by challenging one of the two main characters (mostly Takeo) and testing the couple's love by trying to impart their own selfish desires.  But it's all good cause they all become friends, right?  :p  Nonetheless, side characters are mostly plot devices with a role that only fits into a certain part of the story before disappearing in order to make room for the next set of side characters in the next arc.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent character development for some\\n\r\n-  The main cast requires each other and cannot stand alone\\n\r\n-  Repetition of lines (seriously, they have Takeo say \"I love you\" at least 5-6 times/episode.)\\n\r\n-  Side characters are simply plot devices\\n\\n\r\nArt: Ore Monogatari's style of art is what you would expect from a shoujo romance.  The colors are all extremely light and are very bright and flowery, and especially with the character designs with the jewel-like eyes and the detailed lips, Ore Monogatari very much resembles a general shoujo and the style that they're drawn in.  In addition, the detail of the show doesn't really waver all the much except during comedic moments, so that's nice.\\n\\n\r\nAs for comedy, Ore Monogatari hosts a lot of exaggerations and exaggerated expressions to precisely encapsulate what they want to show you.  Dialing back the detail in some cases, the comedic appearance of the show varies from scene to scene, but mostly stays in the realm of changing the way the characters are drawn and especially, Takeo's perspective.  (Cause my god, it he huge.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent art\\n\r\n+ Good detail\\n\r\n-  Generic Shoujo-style artwork\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound for Ore Monogatari is a mix of melancholy and uplifting.  For its OP, we have its iconic \"Answer\", a cute little song that talks about cakes and asking for an answer.  (Which the question I assume is, Do you love me, or something.)  It's a nice uplifting song that tells you what you should expect going into it, a little love story that plays off of the idea of whether the main couple actually love each other or not.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd for its ED, we have \"Shiawase no Arika\", a melancholic piece that plays towards those moments of doubt that the show attempts to showcase to its audience.  It's a nice little rock song that has that feeling of hope to it.  It's nice, but it doesn't hold a candle to the OP in terms of memorabilia.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent soundtrack\\n\r\n+ Memorable OP\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: When I first was told about Ore Monogatari, and how it was an actually good Shoujo, I was a bit apprehensive, since Shoujo romance hasn't really changed drastically in terms of story for a lot of anime.  But, when the characters actually got together early on, then my interest was piqued. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\\n\r\nKind of.  I liked the show early on as they tried to light this fire that this newly formed couple had since it was the start of the relationship and I was curious about how things would go.  I also really like Suna as a character (since he is the best bro), and the OP to the whole series is a pretty enjoyable track.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I enjoy about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nAs the series went on, the show got incredibly repetitive, as there were a bunch of love rivals for the story that came every few episodes and took hold of the show for a good little while before releasing, go into something completely unrelated, before going back to it.  The repetitiveness of the plot as well as the fact that the main characters couldn't say a different line half the time soured the experience a little.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of shoujo or you REALLY like sweet relationships, this is the show for you.  The entire show is about its main couple really with only 4 or so episodes focused on other characters, and each of those are one-off for different characters.  Because of the way its story is made, aside from its odd couple, there isn't much beyond a generic shoujo.  If you're fine with that, then go for it.  If not, then maybe this anime isn't for you.",

            "content": "The most important aspect of romance anime is usually its characters. If there is a solid cast, the viewer is automatically satisfied even if the story is not the most outstanding. The same principle applies for Ore Monogatari.\r\nAired in Spring 2015 and animated by Studio Madhouse, this two-cours anime follows Gouda Takeo, an unpopular male who does not manage to find a girlfriend even though he has longed for one since he had been in kindergarten. The reasons for this are, on the one hand, his unusual appearance and, on the other hand, his awkward behaviour. People who are not acquainted with Takeo think heis scary due to his height and his loud nature. However, most of his classmates are his friends \u2013 in fact, one could even say they admire him \u2013 which clearly shows that Takeo is not your typical unpopular protagonist. He is a good person who would do anything to help other people even though he has to surmount dangerous situations he probably would not survive without his apparent super-human strength. Due to this and several other factors, Takeo is one of the most loveable characters of present-day anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe female lead of the series, Yamato Rinko, frequently has to explain to her friends why she likes Takeo. At the beginning of the anime, said friends do not comprehend her behaviour but as it continues, they, too, begin to understand that Takeo not only is not scary at all but also would do anything for Yamato to be happy. Unfortunately, the female protagonist's character is not the most compelling. The viewer is presented with the fact that she likes baking but other than that she possesses only few distinguishable character traits. She has a charming personality and is the cause of some interesting character development concerning Takeo but regrettably lacks in depth. There are a lot of supporting characters who have both a more interesting background story and greater character development than her. While this might show another positive side of the anime \u2013 namely, its great supporting cast \u2013 it also demonstrates how Yamato's character pales in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nAnother important character is Takeo's best friend, Sunakawa Makoto. Suna is the complete opposite of Takeo: He is charming, good-looking and popular. However, similar to Takeo, he also has never had a girlfriend even though his reasons are different in that he is the person who does not want a relationship. Suna mostly acts as the person who helps Takeo in several situations that he does not understand. Moreover, he might be the main reason why the protagonists' relationship is as strong as it is. However, this does not mean that Suna is a simple plot device without a personality on his own. In fact, he is incredibly amusing since he also is socially awkward in some situations \u2013 but differently from Takeo \u2013 and is the anime's second-most interesting character.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the anime's supporting characters are great. Not only do they trigger interesting development for Takeo but each of them has a unique backstory and believable growth. There might be some characters you do not find very likeable but, in the end, you will have to admit that all of them serve a purpose and fit into the anime incredibly well.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime's plot mostly focuses on Takeo's and Yamato's relationship in different environments. You can see them interact with one another in the park, at the restaurant, or in an amusement park. Moreover, you are presented with some hardships they have to face that seem to threaten their relationship. The outcome is completely predictable and while there is a lack of drama, you have to understand that Ore Monogatari does not need it. At its core, this anime is about the light-hearted relationship between its two main characters and any unnecessary drama would only hurt it. However, if it were not for the solid cast, this would not be the case. An episodic anime whose story seems to be repetitive such as this one is only able to function if its characters make every episode a unique experience. That being said, there are some moments which seem to exist in order to spice up the anime's story but they are not too bothering and may even prevent the anime from becoming boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is really simple and not especially detailed. However, in the case of Ore Monogatari, this is not a bad thing. On the contrary, the simplicity underlines the anime's light-heartedness and consequently improves its atmosphere. Additionally, more exciting scenes are much more detailed, which increases those scenes' credibility.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is not necessarily memorable but simply adds to the anime's atmosphere, which is perfectly fine. The opening theme, on the other hand, is incredibly catchy and sets the proper mood at the beginning of each episode. The ending theme, while being a nice song on its own, unfortunately does not fit the anime due to its melancholic tone.\\n\\n\r\nOre Monogatari is not a comedy anime. It does have some funny moments but its quality is not based on those. Instead, the comedy adds to the cast's likeability rather than being one of the anime's strong aspects on its own. Moreover, if you are looking for an anime with a compelling story and a lot of plot twists, this one is probably not to your liking. However, if you wanted me to recommend an anime without unnecessary melodrama but with heart-warming moments, a great atmosphere and light-hearted interactions, my first advice would be Ore Monogatari.",

            "content": "\"Ore Monogatari\" - An anime that I thought would be amazing but ended up disappointing. In the first few episodes, I really enjoyed how funny the episodes were and how there was an actual plot on whether Takeo would get with Yamato but literally 3 episodes in , they are already together. So I was thinking in my head , how is this anime going to be 24 episodes long? It felt to me like this anime should be about 12 episodes long. I felt that 24 would drag it on too long but I gave the anime the benefit of the doubt and continuedwatching.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem started when there was no character progression in the characters or plot at all. It felt like I was watching fillers past the first seven episodes or so. It became boring and repetitive. This anime reminded me of \"Sakamoto desu ga?\" which I watched last summer and had this exact same problem. In that anime as well ,it was hilarious and amazing the first five episodes or so but after that it felt like the same thing over and over and the characters were the same from the beginning of the anime to the end. In \"Ore Monogatari\" , Sunakawa , and the couple are exactly the same , nothing changed about them , barely any development. If Sunakawa had a stronger presence and if Yamato actually stopped being so \"nice\" and stuff then this anime probably would have been much stronger.\\n\\n\r\nYamato is wayy too \"nice\" and baked way too many pastries for Takeo. It was cute for the first two-three episodes but it became really annoying the more and more she did it. The difference between Takeo and Yamato was unsettling too, Yamato looks like a ten year old girl and Takeo looks like he is in his mid twenties. It just does not look/feel cute at all watching the couple. I much preferred the Nanako couple. Also it is cute to see Takeo saying he loves Yamato once in a while but when he does it multiple times every episode it just becomes annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe solution to this anime that would have made it amazing in my opinion is if it A)Shortened the anime to 12-13 episodes instead of 24 and adding useless fillers or \\n\r\nB) Develop Sunakawa and Yamato's character's presence to the point you see progression / change throughout the episodes not have them be exactly the same from episode 1 to 24.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't great. I don't recommend watching this one as there are many other good comedy romance anime. The anime feels dragged out and seems like there isn't a lot of substance in the episodes aside from the first few. Unnecessary new side characters and back stories dragging the anime on longer than needed be.\\n",

Introduction and development of characters is seamless, and mirrors reality as the advancement of these characters further deepens the relationships and interactions between all other actors and parties. The author also spectacularly avoids the extremely common pitfall of core character overload, where once characters are created and introduced they become a mainstay of every episode. This expert restraint completely skirts the deluge of a cast heavy inflexible mess, that often drowns a show in both endless group episodes andthe diffusion of responsibility to ever deeply develop any of the characters. This display of confidence is evident from the authors ability to remove characters when necessary, and the more common than not solo and duo characters scenes in this show. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough great, this show has 1 major and 2 minor flaws. The major being that due to the speed at which the main characters become a couple, the inner dynamic and struggle between the characters that most love stories follow is forced outward, and caste unto other parties. Some episodes do pertain to the advancement of the main characters relationship, but more likely than not, they act as a cornerstone for which other characters and stories can further be examined and elevated. \\n\\n\r\nThe first of the 2 minor flaws is that some plot moments are unrealistic and feel forced. The intent is to further illuminate character traits by creating extreme situations for them to act in, but the generation of these events are suspiciously convenient to the point of obviousness. You could argue this is a work of fiction, and some fantasy should inclinate to a degree of suspended disbelief, but few other qualities of the show seem to indicate that the viewer should follow this notion. \\n\\n\r\nThe second of the 2 minor flaws is that the ending episodes of the show become arbitrarily shonen, and detracts from the entire aforementioned cornerstone premise. The show abandons all of it's previous buildings to attempt at making an impactful battle with a resolution to deepen the characters relationship with each other. Unfortunately this clearly intends to resolve in the most obvious way possible, resulting in no drama to be cultivated, and causing the three end episodes feel like a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nArt is above average. Sound is above average. Overall very enjoyable.",

            "content": "In a stale romance genre stuffed with tired tropes that are implemented all for the sake of uniting pairs of ho-hum characters in the most tortuous and seemingly interminable ways possible, Ore Monogatari!! refreshingly forgoes many of the conventions overly relied on by the majority of its peers and instead opts for a simple but earnest story that focuses on romantic and platonic love in equal parts. Its unique approach is grounded in featuring three main characters who all genuinely care for one another but are not involved in a romantic zero-sum game. Because of this, the show is able to remain true to itsshoujo roots in telling a sweet love story while largely sidestepping the pitfalls that have plagued other entries in the genre.\\n\\n\r\nOre Monogatari!! avoids being single-minded in its storytelling by rejecting the traditionally narrow focus on a girl, a boy, and their predictable journey toward a dramatic series-ending declaration of love. Although the show begins by threatening to walk down that beaten path, the relationship between Takeo and Yamato\u2014the male and female romantic leads, respectively\u2014is established early on, and the remainder of the show chronicles the gradual blossoming of their feelings. Through the overcoming of various internal and external conflicts, their relationship slowly but surely transforms from mere puppy love into something a tad more substantial. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, in a genre where three is almost always a crowd and friendship is often secondary, what is particularly compelling about Ore Monogatari!! is its reverence for the brotherly love between Takeo and his best friend Sunakawa, as well as the developing friendship between Sunakawa and Yamato. As Sunakawa aids Takeo in tackling love-related issues for the first time, both characters are able to reflect on their lifelong friendship and attain a deeper appreciation for each other. Similarly, as Sunakawa helps Yamato with the same matters, they grow to better understand each other and are able to bond through their love\u2014albeit very different forms of love\u2014for Takeo. Although the development between Sunakawa and Yamato is subtle by comparison and mostly implied, it is nonetheless sufficient to establish Takeo, Sunakawa, and Yamato as an inseparable trio. The parting shot that concludes the series, a variation of the final cake image from the opening credits, perfectly illustrates their dynamic by depicting the three cake toppers designed after the characters standing in a row and facing forward, perhaps symbolizing the characters\u2019 love and support for each other and readiness in taking on life\u2019s challenges together.\\n\\n\r\nBy telling the story through a tight-knit trio rather than just a loving couple, the show is able to more gracefully handle the problems that commonly beleaguer its contemporaries. Whereas countless other series bog themselves down by putting the romantic leads through contrived, extended hell from which they have to somehow escape on their own, Ore Monogatari!! generally steers clear of this by primarily relying on Sunakawa and his incredible knack for quickly recognizing and defusing potentially explosive situations. As a result, the typical roadblocks that arise in romance storylines are reduced to trivial speed bumps that are usually passed over within an episode or two, and viewers are not dragged through exhausting, protracted story arcs over small misunderstandings blown out of proportion between inexplicably dense characters.\\n\\n\r\nOre Monogatari!! is a breath of fresh air because of its refusal to bow down to time-honored traditions often found in the genre, allowing three characters to share the spotlight without ever introducing romantic tugs-of-war between any of them. By doing so, the show creates the opportunity to explore the different but equally important forms of love that exist between them and tells a sincere story that deftly avoids the melodrama-filled land mines that litter the paths of so many of its peers.",

The story had me crying happy tears for these two almost the whole time. I don't think I've cried this much over cuteness overload since  Clannad. (Happy tears, not sad. Just noting that.)\r\nThe art may not be some people's cup of tea. But, I think it suited the story. The backgrounds are very pretty. The effects were adorable and sparkly. The opening theme and music were totally perfect. I actually found myself watching the opening at times causeof how cute it was with the song..but, maybe that's just me!\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are totally clueless, but it suites them to boot. The story of how they met was a nice heart warming introduction. The characters play well with each other. The boyfriend is a giant \"bear\" that everyone fears. But, some look up to because of his warm heart. The girlfriend is sweet and can see the beauty in someone, despite the outside appearance. Both very trusting. And, the best friend of the boyfriend is a handsome, but kind and gentle person who really helps push things through. He really is a good best friend, and only the story can really explain it. You have to watch to see!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, The story basically is their cupcake phase, and what most young girls would dream for their first relationship to be like. Each episode always made me smile, and if you like these kinds..I hope you take the time to ride through the whole season!",

There are different aspects to this story that involve other characters that add more entertainment to the main relationship in this show. I personally do not like the main character, Takeo's face, as in that type of art style to the face is not my fave (the exaggerated lips and crazy expressions). I usually want to look at attractive male leads, which is why it took me so long to finally watch it. I actually watched this after watching two \"romance\" animes that left me quite disappointed in the ending cause there was no mutual love!! This seemed likea promising love story so I gave it a chance. I will also like to add that it is also quite funny in addition to getting the love that I was seeking.\\n\\n\r\nThe cuteness of Yamato also is what I enjoyed the most. She is really sweet and caring. I love her. I say if you're also hesitant cause the main character is a little wild looking just know that the entire show does make up for it and he is actually a really good guy.\\n\\n\r\nI am pretty satisfied with the entire show!

            "content": "There's a lot of innocence that comes with the experience of a first love, especially that which is between teenagers. Despite knowing next to nothing about the world, you're often head over heels for one another, bouncing around any idealistic hopes or plans for the future in the process. It's both adorable and sickening, and for its first few episodes, Ore Monogatari does a great job capturing that confusing mix of feelings. Then it tries to be a little bit more than that. \r\nThe most common praise of the show seems to be that isn't your typical shoujo, but I disagree\u2014it kicks off as theprotagonist, Takeo, saves a certain Yamato from being groped on the train, and then begins to follow his relationship with her. It's the modern equivalent of a prince on a white horse saving a helpless girl from a bunch of baddies, except the prince is over six feet tall and not conventionally attractive. Rounding out the two is Sunakawa, a childhood friend who reluctantly takes on the bishounen role. You can practically see the jokes coming, but that's alright; the trio has such nice chemistry together that it's easy to forget how horribly clich\u00e9 it is, and amidst the initial focus on heartwarming cuteness, it manages to paint each and every frame with an endearing stroke. \\n\\n\r\nThe best option would have been to continue down that humble path, as when it comes to reoccurring drama, thin characters don't hold up. And then it starts introducing even more to fill out its subplots. Need to shift the story to jealousy?  Don't worry, add a new character! No way out of the situation you're in? Oh, feel free to throw a relevant one in! Attempts are thankfully made to flesh these side characters out, but after happening a few times in a row, it gets tiring. The show is not concerned about Takeo and Yamato's relationship, but only the events that happen during it. There's even a few jokes about the lack of any relationship progression, but knowing the mangaka is aware of that vital flaw is far more frustrating than funny.  \\n\\n\r\nThe result of this mess is that you're left with more questions each episode. Will Takeo and Yamato ever advance beyond the stage of handholding and throwing around \"I love you\" like it's going out of style? How are the two managing to stick together in their current state? Who is Sunakawa as a character, and why do we know next to nothing about him? I'd hope at least one of these is answered by the end of its run, but it's hard to have expectations of something so stubborn. I have to wonder if it was written with romance in mind, since it works even better as a mystery. \\n\\n\r\nCombined with an ever-declining animation quality and audio so unobtrusive it seems silent,  Ore Monogatari is more of a weekly chore than it is entertainment. You wouldn't be wrong to call it \"Nisekoi without the harem\" (probably why the crossover manga between the two exists), which basically alludes to \"nothing\". It's surprisingly hard to criticize for paragraph upon paragraph without venturing into simple complaints, since the lack of progression doesn't give much material to write about. So while the anime does showcase the directorial prowess of Morio Asaka, visual gags and all, it isn't enough to save the aimless property from the clutches of mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nYou're much better off watching Chihayafuru, which displays the talent of roughly the same staff far more accurately.",

            "content": "Love? It's always stupid. Noting more than a mere faction of genuine feelings and yet, we learn to explore what is love? even we are the one who will break down sooner or later. \r\nStory \r\nThe story is about Takeo Gouda, a first-year high school student. Whose life up until now has been full of bromance. Since despite being unpopular with girls, Takeo has always been fully respected by most of the male characters in the series. They acknowledge him as the best person. They even idolize him. While on the other hand, Takeo's best friend Suna, is undoubtedly popular with girls. All of thefemale characters regardless of age fell in love with Suna. That includes mothers, high school student girls, kindergarten kids and even widows. The story continues with an interesting scene in which Rinko Yamato is nearly being molested inside the train. Now, what will our main character do? \\n\\n\r\nOh God! Takeo God mode is activated, everyone! Run for your life! \\n\r\nCrawl if you need to! Scream if you want to! It\u2019s solely to save your life!\\n\\n\r\nThus, thanks for the molester; we can see a glimpse of what God of Rage can look like. What a truly moment to be experienced. \\n\\n\r\nPoor molester... this hilarious moment turns to heart-wrenching moment, because that molester never ever be seen or heard again\u2026.  Let\u2019s all just assume that he is dead. That\u2019s even better. Now, let\u2019s all said \u201cOwaaaa\u201d as of parting gift for him. Owaaaa! \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\r\nI\u2019ll admit, the art of the characters is little weird. Even when surfing half way of the series, it\u2019s still weird. I mean, those eye lashers are kind of exaggerated. However, it is also one of a flashing scene to see. Well, the idea is new and I\u2019ve never seen one like this before, so it\u2019s a fresh scene to see once in a while. The animation is certainly not a masterpiece level but definitely above of the average. I\u2019ve got to say; at least this series animation is not some well made cheap animation. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe Op and Ed is bringing up such a pleasant atmosphere. It\u2019s obvious that the Op is lovely and slowly capturing all the beholders attention.  Freaking sweet, nothing is more than worth for the series. The vanilla and cream could be more unique than what you may think. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nOne of interesting aspect, all the characters in the series is not your typical character. The love rival, neither friend nor the parents, all of them does has unique traits that fun to be explored. They stand out in their own class without following any other characters we\u2019ve ever seen. The concept of generic and typical clearly has been thrown out. The pace slowly builds up and before we even know, the relationship among all of them is already beautiful in a way. Our effort as we wait patiently to see how this series will be going is paid off. All the matters, we also cherish all those happily moments. In a moment, we can know that Takeo is seriously slow when it\u2019s about the love and feeling but he is not your dense type of characters. \u201cI will never understand if you doesn\u2019t tell me\u201d - Takeo. Hearing those words, we know that he is powerless no matter how strong he can be on physically and mentally but at least he try to understand what\u2019s the problem and the difficulties. He tries to help and solve it by any ways, if it\u2019s mean the happiness for both his friends and girlfriend. Even, if he is the one who will eventually hurt. Takeo, not a badass, warrior nor a hero, he just a type of person who will treasure what\u2019s the most important to him. That\u2019s more than suffice. And in the end, Takeo earns the right to achieve all the happiness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall and Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\n\u201cSometimes people are beautiful. Not in looks. Not in what they say. Just in what they are\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe quote amazingly suited in portraying the whole series. It\u2019s such a beautiful love story in a way. Rather than more of those sweet and sad moments together, they created an inspiring love that bloomed within people hearts. They don\u2019t try to make the series melodramatic, rather, they just let us explored all of the characters freely until we all love them. In a sense, it\u2019s more than meet the eyes. As behalf of my honest opinion, I must say I\u2019ve got a fun ride watching the series until the end. Because love cannot be simplified described as neither words nor actions but more, it\u2019s the purely feeling of two hearts. Tied up by a mysterious red of strings, all the characters, story and pace has been bind up altogether into a hilarious yet lovely moments.\\n",

And at first glance, they look like a mismatch. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to realize as the two looks nothing alike. Takeo looks like a professional sumo wrestler standing nearly 7 feet tall while Yamato has the appearance of a frail schoolgirl. However, the story is more than just about appearances. Because in this love story, destiny connects them in ways that really gives the word \u2018love\u2019 its important meaning.\r\nWritten and crafted by Kazune Kawahara, the seriesis what I consider a classic for the rom-com genre. An interesting catch though is that there isn\u2019t a love triangle between two main guys fighting for a girl. In fact, we have Sunakawa Makoto, a very popular guy who seems to attract almost any girl. The catch is that he is more like the antithesis of a playboy. He doesn\u2019t have any interest in getting a girlfriend but actually devotes his time to help his friend Takeo experience love. Get the general picture? It sets up the primary story that connects Takeo with other characters instead of a drama clingy series. And throughout the way, he becomes part of a love story that changes his life forever.\\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes easily establishes a lot of facts about the main characters. Takeo has the outer appearance of someone that would make almost any girl frighten in fear. However, he is a guy with a heart of gold. His action speaks louder than words as he is dedicated to help others; friends, family, or even strangers. Then, there\u2019s Yamato, a sweet innocent girl who falls for Takeo at first sight after he saves her on the train from an apparent pervert. The series approaches this concept with careful planning as the first episodes builds on the chemistry between the two. Makoto supports them from behind the lines while offering helpful advice. What I find interesting about the initial setup is how Takeo will learn about love. Clearly, he lacks experience when it comes to relationships. These include going on dates, setting up the right moments, or initiating a first kiss. His outer appearance also doesn\u2019t help the fact that he is often misjudged. Yet, the show does a very clever job with fleshing out the characters. Through flashbacks and characterization, we see how Takeo\u2019s personality really is like when he was little. The show also can be persuasive when it comes to letting the audience know why others changes their view on Takeo as the story progresses. A crystal clear way of presenting the story is something that isn\u2019t done so easily with directing but for Ore Monogatari, it knows its ways.\\n\\n\r\nAs relationship dynamics is a primary focus in the show, it\u2019s also risky when the story already sets up the main characters as the couple. No, forget set up. How about just bringing them together in union? While the pacing seems a bit abrupt at first, I can honestly say that the show does an appealing job to show their progress as a couple. This is because other characters are introduced to bring out the best of them together. For instance, there\u2019s Ai, Makoto older sister. While she may seem like a love rival at first, the show quickly makes it clear that the only eyes Takeo has for is Yamato. It shows that he is loyal with his commitments and often tries to prove himself as a worthy boyfriend. Many times throughout the show, Takeo appeals to others (including Ai) for advice. These include reading girls magazines, learning to cook, and even trying to very comically to practice kissing with a friend. We also get a good idea that Takeo wants to be with Yamato both physically and emotionally. As he lacks experience in love, the show inspires ways for Takeo to become better person. This is connected by the relationship Takeo shares with Yamato, Makoto, Ai, and more characters later on. \\n\\n\r\nAs sweet as the show can be, one might question about the pacing of the series. How does Ore Monogatari formulate into a 2 cour series about a couple that becomes official at so early in the stage? I had some doubts at first about this and it can be understandable if some people feels that the show can be repetitive. Almost every episode feels similar as it focuses on Takeo and Yamato. Hardly any other character becomes the main focus although they do have some roles, whether major or minor. It can also be frustrating sometimes to see how dense Takeo is when taking the initiative that involves what couples should be doing (ex. Holding hands, kissing, etc). In essence, a show like this often puts the couple ahead of others but it isn\u2019t entirely shy to give some supporting characters their own spotlights. Characters such as Saijou and Nanako gets their own exclusive episode while Ai also her spotlight moments with Takeo. In essence, it\u2019ll take patience to watch the show. Luckily, there\u2019s comedy that factors into entertainment. Rather than relying on dirty fan service or shock value, the show has a charming presence of delivering humor. The main part of it comes from the couple of Takeo and Yamato as they show human expressions that you would typically see in any rom-com. Then, there\u2019s also Takeo as he accomplishes nearly inhuman feats because of his impressive physique. Similarly, Makoto and Takeo\u2019s relationship can also get quite comedic because of the latter\u2019s occasional lack in common sense. If you want comedy, then there\u2019s a performance that will get you smiling.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse adapts the manga with its production and to be quite honest, it\u2019s gorgeous. The color palette like background and character designs illustrates the classic feel of what a rom-com shoujo should be. Character designer Hamada Kunihiko (Nana, Chihayafuru) puts emphasis on the characters\u2019 youthful looks to give them their appeal. Of course, Takeo stands out as the most prominent figure in the show. He is designed to look like a professional sumo wrestler who stands out taller and more ripped than anyone in the show. Yamato has the innocent look of a flower while the Sunakawa siblings are designed to look like beauties. It creates a surge of diversity with the main cast that people can feel attached to. And speaking of diversity, the show also ventures to other settings besides school such as the outdoor woods and beach. Lastly, the show\u2019s fan service isn\u2019t relied on showing skin despite having the classic beach episode. Instead, it further progresses the relationship between Takeo and Yamato. From a humorous perspective, the character reactions is what really brings out the entertainment values that fans may crave for.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is fairly decorative although not outstanding. The OST and OP theme songs are neat for their ability to portray the style of the show. But what may stands out more is the character voice mannerisms. Takeo\u2019s voice sounds like he is a lot older than he appears to be while Yamato is the opposite. She has a soft voice that really shows her innocence. The Sunakawa siblings both have a more mature voice in particular Ai as she is portrayed as the older sister type. So what does this mean? It basically shows that the characters are realistic to their appearance and roles. \\n\r\nNo, I wouldn\u2019t say Ore Monogatari is a show that will be bucketing tears. There\u2019s no tragic moments that makes the audience feel like there\u2019s a need to cry. Instead, we get a classic shoujo rom-com with affectionate character relationships. Even the love triangles that occasionally appears in the show doesn\u2019t go into a direction that gets distracting. And while the pacing will feel a bit repetitive, it\u2019s also important to realize the objective of Ore Monogatari!!: to tell a love story with charm, elegance, realism, and developing youth. And that is a certain kind of beautiful.",

            "content": "I watched Ore Monogatari after seeing lots of good reviews about it. Especially because they said that it's \"really good\" and \"unique\", but watching this anime made me VERY disappointed.\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nI would've given it a higher score if it wasn't a 24 episodes anime. Why? Because this anime is mostly about \"nothing\". Lots of people said that it's unique but I don't see anything unique about it. It started off like this: Guy saves the girl, they started to meet a lot.\r\nSo the rest of the series went on like this: Meet (there are flowers and bubbles every time they meet), lovey-dovey, meet,lovey-dovey,petty problem,meet,lovey-dovey,petty problem,meet-lovey-dovey,petty problem. Imagine 21 episodes of nothing but the same things over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is the only thing that I like in this anime because it's so pretty.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are not that really interesting for me, so I often skip them. The were also lots of times where a scene became even more boring because of the background music that's playing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nTakeo - There are lots of anime where the male lead is not handsome so Takeo is not the \"first\". The only difference  is that, he is \"obviously\" very ugly and bigger compared to most of the characters. They said that, \"even though he is ugly at least he is kind\". But then in this anime, Takeo is not the only kind person. Almost everyone is kind. Even that handsome Suna is kind. So, what makes Takeo great compared to them?\\n\\n\r\nYamato - is the usual shoujo female lead. Cute,Tiny ( TOO tiny for Takeo which really bothers me a lot), she looks fragile but at least she knew how to make a move on the guy that she like without making herself looks like a flirt. There is nothing interesting about her, some female characters are even more interesting than her.\\n\\n\r\nSunakawa- The complete opposite of Takeo. He is handsome and popular, but even though he is handsome he didn't act like a bad person. I admire his character a lot. He is such a good friend. But then, I thought that there will be something more to him. Something to look forward to, but none of that happened since this anime focused on Takeo and Yamato's relationship.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\nI almost want to dropped it after 7 episodes.  Because that 7 episodes almost bored me to death, but I have a policy not to drop any anime so I had to bear with it. It would've been okay if it's only 12 episodes.",

            "content": "So Ore Monogatari!! has come to an end. To be honest, I want to say firstly. Thank you Madhouse for bringing another Romance on the table. If I remember correctly they made Chihayafuru, which also had the same little picky artstyle for this series. As expected, Madhouse delivers as the usual an adaptation fairly from the manga and correctly, however one question comes into the mind of people... is this show worth a watch? Well lets begin.\r\nStory: Well pretty much the story is simple to explain. Our main protagonist Takeo Gouda, who has a friend named Suna, one day saw a girl getting some sortof touch by a pervert, he defends the girl and saves her from him, and thats when pretty much the start of so called love at first sight begins. Now for starters, the show to my eyes barely does cliche stuff. Barely, I actually give props to the actual author for the series first for this, because the romance felt for the most part uncliche, and very nice looking. However the only issue I have for this series are a couple of things here and there. For one thing lets talk about the dialogue in this show. The dialogue may be considered as repetitive, and the second thing being inconsistent. By inconsistent I mean the comedy itself seems very lackluster and limited, and most of the time they use the same words for the entirety of the show. I honestly don't mind the dialogue being repetitive, but when you get the words like \"Tsuki-da!\" by Takeo every second, at first you don't mind but then it gets annoying. The dialogue is limited by one sentence and the repetition of words (also known as the one liners) for a lot of times in the anime series, which affects the show as well. The other problem when I said about consistencies of the comedy, it also repeats the sequence of its humour, at firs it seems funny, but then it doesn't. Its more like it slowly decreases that enjoyment based on the humor aspects, which It gets very jarring and at the same time it feels boring. The second thing I have to say for the series is that the story itself kind of lost its way a bit what made it special. By that I mean the relationship for me feels a bit lacking on some sort of places. But of course the anime does its job to slowly progress or build up the relationship for the main cast but it seems a little bit of the spark was left away a bit. Overall, lets say the story itself is mediocre. The few things I would say the good parts of the anime beside the most of the time romance progression would be the little bit of stories that helped to spice up a bit. It also puts the whole \"Don't judge someone by the outside, judge them by the inside\" message quite well, since this actually happens a couple of times in the anime series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters would be considered as component of average cast. The main cast of characters are for the most part the main focus of the story itself. But for the most most part, would be the focus of our two couples. Takeo and Yamato. \\n\\n\r\nTakeo Gouda being the main protagonist of the show can be considered a lot of things. Smart, Brave, Helpful, Friendly. Though he may seem ugly or looking like a 30 year old person on the outside (considering thats how he looks like to my perception) but he's a character that knows how to help people out. His relationship with Yamato, however, as I said before, at times it seems a little lacking. Its not a bad relationship with her its just for me it feels a bit like a lacking of spice in a bit of areas. Overall I think hes more so a passable character.\\n\\n\r\nYamato, the female lead character would be one of the few weaker components, considering for me as a person I think her character was not fully fleshed out, she needed a bit more of a pizzas to be exact, to let her become memorable. The only thing I can think from her are a few things: she likes to cook pastries, and she loves Takeo. She's also caring, helpful, friendly, nervous at times. She's not a terrible character, but she's not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nLastly Suna, who he for me was one of the fewer characters that kind of moved to the side a bit after the second half. At first he had a slight development between him and Takeo, when they showed backstories from the two of them and of course how they became friends and all, that was pretty nice to put so we can see the bonds of the bromance, however, due to the relationship between Yamato and Takeo growing, he seems a bit irrelevant in some cases of the story, feeling very much lacking on presence to my eyes at times.\\n\\n\r\nFor the side characters, a few of them took a role around the cast, but a few were only shown once and never to be seen again. As well with a couple that appeared more than once and got bit of development. The supporting cast may be big but of course thats a big issue.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Remember when I said that the artstyle was like Chihayafuru? well the artstyle for Ore Monogatari gave me the exact same view when I watched that show. It just feels nice to see the artstyle again because for me it fits very well with its characters, of course as well lets talk about overall art. The art isn't that great as it does suffer a couple of inconsistencies through the series. However they do manage to keep consistent with the far frame and of course the faces, they make the faces look adorable enough. The background at times seems very standard but when it comes at times for memorable moments or the beautiful moments between the two characters it gives more of a spring feel to it, and a very atmospheric one as well. For the animation would be alright to be honest. It does seem a bit choppy at times but not too groundbreaking.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: The music can be entitled into one sentence. \"Calming\". Yes. Calming at times, and very beautiful when it comes to the moments in their relationship. As well with a couple of soundtracks that makes them memorable to my eyes. Note that memorable doesn't mean masterpiece to be honest. In the sound department they sometimes nail the presentation of the sound right, but at times (a bit) seems very hard to listen to. Of course, thats just me. I also have to say that the Opening and the Ending are well fitting for the show. Especially the ending song.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even with the flaws of the series, at times I do have to say the show did deliver at times scenes that makes me giggle, and at times that makes me laugh. It just went a bit toned down after the second half for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nA decent show to watch, of course, its just a little special in a matter of progression, but to me it lost a bit its way. The main cast is passable while the supporting might be lacking, the art is good enough and same with the music. Its a show that could be a hit or a miss for anyone.",

An unpopular guy amongst girls, who's not bullied every waking existence, saves a girl from a train molester and gets her number. His dense mindset towards the girl's feelings was funny and corny at the same time, but was understandable because of the backstory we had been given. When he eventually understands her feelings they finally start dating and this is when the fun stuff begins...\r\nOr so I had hoped.\r\nI should have just dropped it then and there because after finding out that they both likeeach other, they basically become lampposts that moths hover around. Everything happens just because one or both of them exist. Their relationship never changes and is basically set in stone from that point on.

            "content": "Okay, now that I've seen all the episodes, I can finally write a review about this extremely lovable anime, even though I've never written a review before. I am absolutely smitten with this anime. \r\nLet me elaborate.\r\nWARNING: THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS SO PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED THE ENTIRE THING.\r\nThis anime tells a love story, obviously, as the title says. Our main character is Gouda Takeo, a 2-meter tall, muscular, even a bit scary-looking high school freshman who doesn't look his age by any means. Despite his scary appearance, he's good-hearted, energetic, always willing to help out anyone in need, which earnsrespect from his classmates and also other girls (which he is painfully unaware of). Then there's his love interest, a teeny-tiny petite shy girl named Yamato Rinko, who is really into baking cookies, helping out others in need, basically, she's just as pure-hearted as Takeo. Their love story begins when Takeo saves Yamato from a groper while on the same train. The two fall in love on first sight, although Takeo has a hard time believing she really does like him, due to his unusual appearance and girls' tendencies to dislike guys like him. Which is, frankly, so damn adorable. Takeo is not your usual anime dude. Even though he posesses superhuman strength and is adored by absolutely everyone who gets to know him, he is super modest and a little bit insecure. He also respects Yamato a great deal, going so far as having trouble calling her by her first name, being super nervous about holding her hand, promising not to even lay a finger on her until she wants him to. She, on the other hand, is embarassed by having occasional dirty thoughts about him, gets super excited about holding his hand, is amazed by his strength, always cheers for him, and so on. The contrast between the two (she's super-tiny and delicate while he's an awkward giant) is SO. DAMN. ADORABLE. Their relationship is SO. DAMN. ADORABLE. The story is SO. DAMN. ADORABLE. even though it revolves mostly around their lovey-dovey encounters ('Takeo-kun, I love you so much!', 'Aaaah, Yamato, I love you too!' and so on and so forth). It's SO FREAKING ADORABLE that I don't even give a damn about the story not being as developed as you'd expect it to be (hence why I gave it a 9 instead of a 10). \\n\r\nThough I must say, I really applaud the development in the latest episodes, and the small hardship the two faced (not gonna spoil it. But it's a happy ending, of course.)\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the reason why I liked this anime so freaking much is because I'm in a relationship with a guy similar to Takeo... and we're kinda like Takeo and Yamato... so it hits too hard home. Oh well. :D\\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is really crisp, the colors are nice, the backgrounds are nice, basically there's nothing to dislike. The whole thing is very fresh-looking. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn't as offputting as you'd expect your typical shojo anime soundtrack to be. The opening song was actually really nice, I'd sit through the opening humming along to it, which is what I never ever do (when I watch anime I usually skip openings, except if I really like the song). Whoever sings the opening and ending songs did a great job, their voice is really gentle and nice, and not making me want to stab my eardrums with a fork until they bleed. Background music during the episodes is also enjoyable, there's not a single thing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6\\n\r\nWhile I absolutely adore Takeo and Yamato, I found myself wanting to punch the writers in the face for not showing basically any background story relating to Takeo's best friend, Sunakawa-kun. Sunakawa-kun is your typical bishounen on the outside, extremely gorgeous, but very quiet and mysterious on the inside. But we don't find out anything about why is he like that. We don't know why doesn't he pursue girls (other than disliking them for talking shit about Takeo behind his back) and why is he always so distant. He has no other significance in the anime other than being around Takeo, helping out Takeo 'n shit... everything is always revolving around Takeo. I was hoping Sunakawa-kun would find a girlfriend by the end of the series, but I ended up being disappointed. The girl who showed up as a potential love interest for him ended up being turned down for no apparent reason even though she might be a good match for him. AND WE DIDN'T EVEN GET ANY DEEPER EXPLANATION AS TO WHY WOULD HE REJECT HER, WHY IS HE ALWAYS LIKE THAT. I was so, so, so disappointed. Also, Sunakawa-kun's sister... and the guy who's interested in her (Oda-kun)... very little to no development at all. The plot revolves way too much around Takeo for my liking and doesn't give space to other characters and their development. Which made me really sad and disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 10/10\\n\r\nEven despite the aforementioned flaws in character development, I really enjoyed this anime, as I've stated before. It's not your typical shojo anime, it's crisp, enjoyable, and it's definitely worth a shot if you want to watch something light and cheerful without any deeper story to it. For all of you out there who like adorable love stories but with a slightly different charm to it, without a lot of shojo cliches, you could really enjoy this anime. I absolutely recommend it. ^^\\n\\n\r\nHope this review was helpful enough. Cheers!",

            "content": "Want an anime to make you smile even when you\u2019re feeling down? Want something that makes you ahh at its sweetness and purity? And most of all, something that makes you think, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I have relationships like this?\u201d\r\nJoin Gouda Takeo on his incredibly heart-warming journey to find true love, experience high school struggles, and aid everyone who ever meets him by doing as many good deeds as he possibly can. If there\u2019s a cat stuck in a tree, Takeo will rescue it. If a child falls into a river, Takeo will jump in. If a friend wants to confess to his crush, Takeo willhelp him arrange it.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it\u2019s not the deeds Takeo does that make him such a likeable character. It\u2019s the way he\u2019s presented. The description \u2018big heart\u2019 fits him perfectly. He\u2019s pure, kind and just good. He\u2019s the type of friend who will always help you without even thinking twice about it, even turning a simple thought or wish expressed into an action in order to make the person expressing the thought happy. And although he can be a bit dense at times, if you explain things to him he will take pains to remember them and act upon them in the future.\\n\\n\r\nWhat then, is the catch? Well this should be obvious from looking at the cover. He\u2019s not conventionally good looking. And because of this, no girl is able to recognize his good character until the female protagonist from the story comes along. Luckily she ends up being less shallow than every other girl that has existed up until this point, and thus we have our story.\\n\\n\r\nThis girl though, Yamato Rinko, is really something in herself. She\u2019s just as pure, kind and sweet as Takeo (with the addition of being shyer and somewhat smarter). This essentially creates many scenes filled with what we colloquially name \u2018fluff\u2019 \u2013 that is to say, adorably sweet scenes in which the characters radiate such happiness that you can\u2019t help but smile. They don\u2019t even have to be doing much (and often they really don't do much), just chatting or something and you\u2019ll still enjoy watching them. Although an exaggeration of a normal relationship, most people would probably view something similar to this \u2013 with their mutual love, respect and acceptance \u2013 as relationship goals. \\n\r\nTheir relationship progression does slow down as the series goes on, but although that's a little irritating it actually fits in with the characters' personalities and how you'd expect them to behave.\\n\\n\r\nI will note here that if you binge watch this show in a couple of sessions or less it might end up being sickly sweet and a bit of a turn-off, because it is after all comprised of many episodes very similar in content. Rather, if you just watch a couple of episodes every now and then it will stay fresh and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nNow we turn to the third protagonist, the \u2018best friend\u2019 character. Sunakawa\u2019s character is also portrayed remarkably well, as a character who often appears apathetic and emotionless but shows his real feelings through what he does, rather than what he says. His looks are on the opposite end of the spectrum to Takeo\u2019s, and this is a recurring theme in the series, but the parts where he appears mainly highlight how caring and loyal a friend he is to Takeo (and by extension Yamato). It\u2019s almost impossible not to wish you had a friend like him. In addition, he is actually developed quite well as a character by himself, and piques a lot of interest. Issues concerning him are resolved well and realistically, in particular his family drama. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting cast, watching them is hugely enjoyable too. Each of them brings something to the story and helps it develop, although they are mainly used as a catalyst for the main romance. None of the characters are obnoxious, all of them are quite pleasant and a lot of them are given decent backstory which helps flesh out their characters. There is an entire set of episodes dedicated to Sunakawa's sister that creates an interesting little diversion from Takeo and Yamato.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and Ending themes were a good fit for the story. They matched the overall tone perfectly, with the light and cheerful music. The Seiyuus were talented (my only complaint here was the incredible high pitch used for Yamato which seemed a tad unrealistic for a 16 year old girl, although I guess it\u2019s more common in Japan) and the rest of the music was easy on the ears.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and animation were lovely. They were attractive (with a lot of pastel tones being used), and the high concentration of flowery and sparkly effects went together so well with the characters' reactions.\\n\\n\r\nI suppose I haven\u2019t really covered the plot, but then again there\u2019s not much to say about it. It\u2019s a story of how a romance buds and develops, and however well done it is, that is essentially the full story. Oh well. I\u2019ll just use this as an example of how an anime doesn\u2019t need a focussed plot to be good.\\n\\n\r\nNow to conclude. I thought this anime was great, and personally connected to some of the characters and events portrayed on an intrinsic level. The lack of focussed plot did prevent me from giving it a higher score, because, sweet as their relationship was, I would have loved to see them take it a little further in the amount of episodes that had been allocated. \\n\\n\r\nIt was still a really enjoyable, really fun watch, though, and one I would most definitely recommend to any fan whatsoever of the romance genre. \ud83d\ude0a\\n",

            "content": "Gouda Takeo is an unusually large freshman in high school. He's large and muscular and not conventionally attractive, but he's a teddy bear on the inside. His closest friend is Sunakawa Makoto, an introverted bishounen who is basically the polar opposite of Takeo. One day Takeo notices a girl being groped on a train, and he saves her. She falls in love with both his good moral character and appearance instantly, and he falls for her as well. The two of them begin a romantic journey together. \r\nOre Monogatari!! stands out from other romantic comedies largely because of its unattractive male lead. Most shoujo romancesfeature delicate bishounen who bear more resemblance to Suna, and \"ugly\" characters like Takeo are usually portrayed as disgusting stalker otaku. The series also defies stereotypes when Suna manages to clear up all the clich\u00e9 misunderstandings in just one episode and ultimately gets Yamato and Takeo to confess to each other. In this regard, Ore Monogatari!! is revolutionary. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing Ore Monogatari!! does very well is portraying friendship between guys. Typical shoujo often ignore the friendships between male friends, so it's refreshing and heart-warming to see the \"bro\" relationship between Takeo and Suna, as well as between Takeo and his other friends. Suna is, without a doubt, the best character in this series. I can honestly say that I watched this show almost entirely for him. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Ore Monogatari!! has some substantial flaws. While it has a unique premise, its comedy becomes overused quickly. While I enjoyed the comedy once a week, it would be tiresome to watch in one sitting. To reference a MAL review, most jokes have to do with Takeo's size, Suna's appearance, Takeo and Suna's unlikely friendship, or Takeo and Yamato's innocence. The jokes are repetitive, and nothing really new is brought to the comedy spectrum. \\n\\n\r\nThe other big issue with Ore Monogatari!! is that there are no real problems in Takeo and Yamato's relationship. They both have insecurities, sure, but those insecurities are dealt with quickly so that the two can return to fluff. The only really significant insecurity comes right at the end of the series, and it's given barely any time to develop. A resolution is shoved in our faces with very little time left in the series, and as a result, there is no time for the characters to undergo any development with this final trial. \\n\\n\r\nWhile it certainly is true that Ore Monogatari!! distinguishes itself from other shoujo by clearing up the misunderstandings within three episodes, there's a reason clich\u00e9 shoujo drag out romance so much: it provides a goal for the series. Other successful shoujo romance anime like Kimi ni Todoke, Lovely Complex, and Kaichou wa Maid-sama!, which I might add were all two-cour series, took a lot longer for the romance to develop. While it was frustrating at times, it provided viewers with something to look forward to. On the other hand, the entirety of Ore Monogatari!! starting from episode 3 is in the couple's honeymoon phase, and we don't get to see the realistic, less pretty side of relationships. All we get from them is \"Takeo-kun, daisuki!\" and \"SUKI DA!!!\". Despite Takeo and Yamato liking each other, there's so much they have yet to learn about one another. There's so much they may not agree on, yet we haven't seen any of it. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the story, there are a few other things to consider. The art is prety good, and it does a good job emphasizing just how different Yamato, Takeo and Suna are. The reaction scenes (especially Suna's) are done really well. The soundtrack of the series is pretty, and complements romantic moments well. It chimes in at the right moments. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its flaws I mentioned above, I really enjoyed this anime. Maybe that sounds hypocritical now, but I really did like it. It addresses not only romance but also platonic friendships, difficult family situations, and even introducing a new life into the world! But like I said earlier, I don't think I could stomach watching it in one sitting. The overused jokes and fluff are nice once a week, but not if you're trying to marathon the show. The lack of real issues is frustrating. The sheer length of Ore Monogatari!! was its greatest flaw, and I believe it would have been a lot more successful as a one-cour series. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 7 \\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 6 \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 \\n\r\nOverall score: 6/10 \\n\r\nDo I recommend it? YES! (Just take breaks every now and then)",

            "content": "Shoujo romance has been very formulaic as of late.  You either have the perfect boy with the perfect features or what have you, falling or trying to woo over the inadequate or least popular girl in the entire school, or you have a pair of adorable people who for love of all that is good and holy don't even confess to each other AT ALL.  So, we have a predicament here.  We have a shoujo romance that has neither of those things as its base story line so...what do we do with Ore Monogatari then?\r\nStory: Gouda Takeo is a first year high-schooler.Known by many of the people at school as a VERY large individual (about 6'4\" in height), all Takeo ever wanted, was to get a girl to like him back.  Throughout the years through no fault of his own, Takeo has always been unable to confess to the girls he likes because of his unintentionally suave friend, Makoto Sunakawa.  So, after going into high school and saving a girl from a groper on a train, he meets the lovely (and ridiculously tiny) girl, Rinko Yamato, and thus a new crush begins.  \\n\\n\r\nOre Monogatari plays a lot like your general shoujo romance slice of life comedy show.  (Wow that is a lot of genres)  Unlike a good number of shoujo romance where the main couple ALMOST reaches the point where they can maybe sorta want to kind of perhaps date each other, Ore Monogatari puts the majority of its runtime straight into the \"these people are actually dating\" category since post episode three, the main characters in the series actually do get together and begin dating each other, which is nice.  However post the confession, what do we have?  Well, we have various things, actually.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from spending time with our main couple and showcasing that this show did indeed put two people together to the extent and comfort level that they can hold hands, kiss, have all sorts of lovey dovey moments, the show also focuses on essentially, building up on that.  Every few episodes, they add in a new shoujo romance trope in order to \"test\" their love, so to speak.  These include the standard things like, acceptance from spouse's friends, love rivals, spending time alone, more love rivals, and finally, a love rival for the other side.  (Yeah, lot of love rivals.)  As such, Ore Monogatari doesn't really part ways from the standard \"Shoujo tropes\" that it comes from.  Sure there are a couple episodes and even an entire section that are not devoted entirely to the main couple, but in comparison, those mini side stories don't hold as much value as the original story.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Ore Monogatari is admittedly a very sweet anime with a very odd looking couple.  It ends on a gentle slope so there're really no issues there, but the show didn't try to differ itself from traditional shoujo aside from its \"beauty and the beast\" motif with the characters' various heights.  A lot of it was still stuff you see from a generic shoujo and it didn't really try and differ itself a lot in that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Interesting main couple\\n\r\n+ Actual progression in the relationship\\n\r\n-  Most of the story was similar and/or bland\\n\r\n-  Story played off like a normal shoujo romance\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters in Ore Monogatari take up two different camps.  The main characters, and everyone else.  \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with our main protagonist, Gouda Takeo.  Takeo, as mentioned before, is a very large human.  He is big, he is strong, he can somehow move faster than a motor vehicle, and he's too nice to people to the extent that he won't consider his own feelings before someone else's.  (Also, he's kind of dense.)  He's like a big teddy bear and he wants to be helpful to everyone as much as he possibly can.  As the series goes on, we get to see Takeo change as he grows to truly treasure his girlfriend Rinko and values their relationship immensely, mostly with the phrase \"I love her\", which is basically said about every 30 seconds whenever he's on screen, which I hate.  One particular thing about the main couple is the fact that their entire personality can sort of be described by their catchphrase.  For Takeo, it's \"I love her\", which tells you that well, he loves her and wants her to be happy.  \\n\\n\r\nThen we have Rinko Yamato, Takeo's fun-sized girlfriend who has an addiction to making cakes.  As a character, Rinko is a very enthusiastic girl.  Particularly, she is very enthusiastic by trying to make Takeo happy as every 30 seconds she spouts out \"Takeo's so cool!\" and other synonyms to that.  In comparison, Yamato doesn't really have the growth that Takeo has, though putting one without the other is like taking strawberries out of shortcake.  The issue I have is that as a character, Rinko doesn't stand out as an individual person, mostly because her defining traits are making sweets, and loving Takeo, and that's about it.  She can't stand by herself as an individual character, and as such, really puts a sour taste to this supposedly really sweet story.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, Makoto Sunakawa, the pretty boy that HAS to exist in every shoujo ever.  Sunakawa is the pinnacle of the perfect \"bro\" character.  Able to see what is happening in any situation including aiding the baka couple that he hangs out with often, Suna acts behind the scenes in any given moment in the anime and tries to help Takeo especially with his love, acting more like a support than anything.  Suna is always the calm one in any frenzy, is always the one to drag Takeo back to earth, and is always there to help with any issues that his friend has, looking out for him like a good older brother figure of sorts.  The issue I have is the fact that the show treats him as the anchor to the relationship and doesn't really expand him out all that much.  They do devote a couple episodes to him, but only really one TRULY focuses on him, and even so, doesn't really explain much to me about him as a character.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters in Ore Monogatari act as friends or family of either of the three main characters.  For the most part, these side characters serve to add the conflict to the story by challenging one of the two main characters (mostly Takeo) and testing the couple's love by trying to impart their own selfish desires.  But it's all good cause they all become friends, right?  :p  Nonetheless, side characters are mostly plot devices with a role that only fits into a certain part of the story before disappearing in order to make room for the next set of side characters in the next arc.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent character development for some\\n\r\n-  The main cast requires each other and cannot stand alone\\n\r\n-  Repetition of lines (seriously, they have Takeo say \"I love you\" at least 5-6 times/episode.)\\n\r\n-  Side characters are simply plot devices\\n\\n\r\nArt: Ore Monogatari's style of art is what you would expect from a shoujo romance.  The colors are all extremely light and are very bright and flowery, and especially with the character designs with the jewel-like eyes and the detailed lips, Ore Monogatari very much resembles a general shoujo and the style that they're drawn in.  In addition, the detail of the show doesn't really waver all the much except during comedic moments, so that's nice.\\n\\n\r\nAs for comedy, Ore Monogatari hosts a lot of exaggerations and exaggerated expressions to precisely encapsulate what they want to show you.  Dialing back the detail in some cases, the comedic appearance of the show varies from scene to scene, but mostly stays in the realm of changing the way the characters are drawn and especially, Takeo's perspective.  (Cause my god, it he huge.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent art\\n\r\n+ Good detail\\n\r\n-  Generic Shoujo-style artwork\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound for Ore Monogatari is a mix of melancholy and uplifting.  For its OP, we have its iconic \"Answer\", a cute little song that talks about cakes and asking for an answer.  (Which the question I assume is, Do you love me, or something.)  It's a nice uplifting song that tells you what you should expect going into it, a little love story that plays off of the idea of whether the main couple actually love each other or not.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd for its ED, we have \"Shiawase no Arika\", a melancholic piece that plays towards those moments of doubt that the show attempts to showcase to its audience.  It's a nice little rock song that has that feeling of hope to it.  It's nice, but it doesn't hold a candle to the OP in terms of memorabilia.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent soundtrack\\n\r\n+ Memorable OP\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: When I first was told about Ore Monogatari, and how it was an actually good Shoujo, I was a bit apprehensive, since Shoujo romance hasn't really changed drastically in terms of story for a lot of anime.  But, when the characters actually got together early on, then my interest was piqued. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\\n\r\nKind of.  I liked the show early on as they tried to light this fire that this newly formed couple had since it was the start of the relationship and I was curious about how things would go.  I also really like Suna as a character (since he is the best bro), and the OP to the whole series is a pretty enjoyable track.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I enjoy about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nAs the series went on, the show got incredibly repetitive, as there were a bunch of love rivals for the story that came every few episodes and took hold of the show for a good little while before releasing, go into something completely unrelated, before going back to it.  The repetitiveness of the plot as well as the fact that the main characters couldn't say a different line half the time soured the experience a little.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of shoujo or you REALLY like sweet relationships, this is the show for you.  The entire show is about its main couple really with only 4 or so episodes focused on other characters, and each of those are one-off for different characters.  Because of the way its story is made, aside from its odd couple, there isn't much beyond a generic shoujo.  If you're fine with that, then go for it.  If not, then maybe this anime isn't for you.",

            "content": "The most important aspect of romance anime is usually its characters. If there is a solid cast, the viewer is automatically satisfied even if the story is not the most outstanding. The same principle applies for Ore Monogatari.\r\nAired in Spring 2015 and animated by Studio Madhouse, this two-cours anime follows Gouda Takeo, an unpopular male who does not manage to find a girlfriend even though he has longed for one since he had been in kindergarten. The reasons for this are, on the one hand, his unusual appearance and, on the other hand, his awkward behaviour. People who are not acquainted with Takeo think heis scary due to his height and his loud nature. However, most of his classmates are his friends \u2013 in fact, one could even say they admire him \u2013 which clearly shows that Takeo is not your typical unpopular protagonist. He is a good person who would do anything to help other people even though he has to surmount dangerous situations he probably would not survive without his apparent super-human strength. Due to this and several other factors, Takeo is one of the most loveable characters of present-day anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe female lead of the series, Yamato Rinko, frequently has to explain to her friends why she likes Takeo. At the beginning of the anime, said friends do not comprehend her behaviour but as it continues, they, too, begin to understand that Takeo not only is not scary at all but also would do anything for Yamato to be happy. Unfortunately, the female protagonist's character is not the most compelling. The viewer is presented with the fact that she likes baking but other than that she possesses only few distinguishable character traits. She has a charming personality and is the cause of some interesting character development concerning Takeo but regrettably lacks in depth. There are a lot of supporting characters who have both a more interesting background story and greater character development than her. While this might show another positive side of the anime \u2013 namely, its great supporting cast \u2013 it also demonstrates how Yamato's character pales in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nAnother important character is Takeo's best friend, Sunakawa Makoto. Suna is the complete opposite of Takeo: He is charming, good-looking and popular. However, similar to Takeo, he also has never had a girlfriend even though his reasons are different in that he is the person who does not want a relationship. Suna mostly acts as the person who helps Takeo in several situations that he does not understand. Moreover, he might be the main reason why the protagonists' relationship is as strong as it is. However, this does not mean that Suna is a simple plot device without a personality on his own. In fact, he is incredibly amusing since he also is socially awkward in some situations \u2013 but differently from Takeo \u2013 and is the anime's second-most interesting character.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned above, the anime's supporting characters are great. Not only do they trigger interesting development for Takeo but each of them has a unique backstory and believable growth. There might be some characters you do not find very likeable but, in the end, you will have to admit that all of them serve a purpose and fit into the anime incredibly well.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime's plot mostly focuses on Takeo's and Yamato's relationship in different environments. You can see them interact with one another in the park, at the restaurant, or in an amusement park. Moreover, you are presented with some hardships they have to face that seem to threaten their relationship. The outcome is completely predictable and while there is a lack of drama, you have to understand that Ore Monogatari does not need it. At its core, this anime is about the light-hearted relationship between its two main characters and any unnecessary drama would only hurt it. However, if it were not for the solid cast, this would not be the case. An episodic anime whose story seems to be repetitive such as this one is only able to function if its characters make every episode a unique experience. That being said, there are some moments which seem to exist in order to spice up the anime's story but they are not too bothering and may even prevent the anime from becoming boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is really simple and not especially detailed. However, in the case of Ore Monogatari, this is not a bad thing. On the contrary, the simplicity underlines the anime's light-heartedness and consequently improves its atmosphere. Additionally, more exciting scenes are much more detailed, which increases those scenes' credibility.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is not necessarily memorable but simply adds to the anime's atmosphere, which is perfectly fine. The opening theme, on the other hand, is incredibly catchy and sets the proper mood at the beginning of each episode. The ending theme, while being a nice song on its own, unfortunately does not fit the anime due to its melancholic tone.\\n\\n\r\nOre Monogatari is not a comedy anime. It does have some funny moments but its quality is not based on those. Instead, the comedy adds to the cast's likeability rather than being one of the anime's strong aspects on its own. Moreover, if you are looking for an anime with a compelling story and a lot of plot twists, this one is probably not to your liking. However, if you wanted me to recommend an anime without unnecessary melodrama but with heart-warming moments, a great atmosphere and light-hearted interactions, my first advice would be Ore Monogatari.",

            "content": "\"Ore Monogatari\" - An anime that I thought would be amazing but ended up disappointing. In the first few episodes, I really enjoyed how funny the episodes were and how there was an actual plot on whether Takeo would get with Yamato but literally 3 episodes in , they are already together. So I was thinking in my head , how is this anime going to be 24 episodes long? It felt to me like this anime should be about 12 episodes long. I felt that 24 would drag it on too long but I gave the anime the benefit of the doubt and continuedwatching.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem started when there was no character progression in the characters or plot at all. It felt like I was watching fillers past the first seven episodes or so. It became boring and repetitive. This anime reminded me of \"Sakamoto desu ga?\" which I watched last summer and had this exact same problem. In that anime as well ,it was hilarious and amazing the first five episodes or so but after that it felt like the same thing over and over and the characters were the same from the beginning of the anime to the end. In \"Ore Monogatari\" , Sunakawa , and the couple are exactly the same , nothing changed about them , barely any development. If Sunakawa had a stronger presence and if Yamato actually stopped being so \"nice\" and stuff then this anime probably would have been much stronger.\\n\\n\r\nYamato is wayy too \"nice\" and baked way too many pastries for Takeo. It was cute for the first two-three episodes but it became really annoying the more and more she did it. The difference between Takeo and Yamato was unsettling too, Yamato looks like a ten year old girl and Takeo looks like he is in his mid twenties. It just does not look/feel cute at all watching the couple. I much preferred the Nanako couple. Also it is cute to see Takeo saying he loves Yamato once in a while but when he does it multiple times every episode it just becomes annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe solution to this anime that would have made it amazing in my opinion is if it A)Shortened the anime to 12-13 episodes instead of 24 and adding useless fillers or \\n\r\nB) Develop Sunakawa and Yamato's character's presence to the point you see progression / change throughout the episodes not have them be exactly the same from episode 1 to 24.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't great. I don't recommend watching this one as there are many other good comedy romance anime. The anime feels dragged out and seems like there isn't a lot of substance in the episodes aside from the first few. Unnecessary new side characters and back stories dragging the anime on longer than needed be.\\n",

            "content": "A love story whose realistic expediency in its resolution is the first indication that the author possess the ability to create a complete and holistic narrative. Introduction and development of characters is seamless, and mirrors reality as the advancement of these characters further deepens the relationships and interactions between all other actors and parties. The author also spectacularly avoids the extremely common pitfall of core character overload, where once characters are created and introduced they become a mainstay of every episode. This expert restraint completely skirts the deluge of a cast heavy inflexible mess, that often drowns a show in both endless group episodes andthe diffusion of responsibility to ever deeply develop any of the characters. This display of confidence is evident from the authors ability to remove characters when necessary, and the more common than not solo and duo characters scenes in this show. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough great, this show has 1 major and 2 minor flaws. The major being that due to the speed at which the main characters become a couple, the inner dynamic and struggle between the characters that most love stories follow is forced outward, and caste unto other parties. Some episodes do pertain to the advancement of the main characters relationship, but more likely than not, they act as a cornerstone for which other characters and stories can further be examined and elevated. \\n\\n\r\nThe first of the 2 minor flaws is that some plot moments are unrealistic and feel forced. The intent is to further illuminate character traits by creating extreme situations for them to act in, but the generation of these events are suspiciously convenient to the point of obviousness. You could argue this is a work of fiction, and some fantasy should inclinate to a degree of suspended disbelief, but few other qualities of the show seem to indicate that the viewer should follow this notion. \\n\\n\r\nThe second of the 2 minor flaws is that the ending episodes of the show become arbitrarily shonen, and detracts from the entire aforementioned cornerstone premise. The show abandons all of it's previous buildings to attempt at making an impactful battle with a resolution to deepen the characters relationship with each other. Unfortunately this clearly intends to resolve in the most obvious way possible, resulting in no drama to be cultivated, and causing the three end episodes feel like a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nArt is above average. Sound is above average. Overall very enjoyable.",

            "content": "In a stale romance genre stuffed with tired tropes that are implemented all for the sake of uniting pairs of ho-hum characters in the most tortuous and seemingly interminable ways possible, Ore Monogatari!! refreshingly forgoes many of the conventions overly relied on by the majority of its peers and instead opts for a simple but earnest story that focuses on romantic and platonic love in equal parts. Its unique approach is grounded in featuring three main characters who all genuinely care for one another but are not involved in a romantic zero-sum game. Because of this, the show is able to remain true to itsshoujo roots in telling a sweet love story while largely sidestepping the pitfalls that have plagued other entries in the genre.\\n\\n\r\nOre Monogatari!! avoids being single-minded in its storytelling by rejecting the traditionally narrow focus on a girl, a boy, and their predictable journey toward a dramatic series-ending declaration of love. Although the show begins by threatening to walk down that beaten path, the relationship between Takeo and Yamato\u2014the male and female romantic leads, respectively\u2014is established early on, and the remainder of the show chronicles the gradual blossoming of their feelings. Through the overcoming of various internal and external conflicts, their relationship slowly but surely transforms from mere puppy love into something a tad more substantial. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, in a genre where three is almost always a crowd and friendship is often secondary, what is particularly compelling about Ore Monogatari!! is its reverence for the brotherly love between Takeo and his best friend Sunakawa, as well as the developing friendship between Sunakawa and Yamato. As Sunakawa aids Takeo in tackling love-related issues for the first time, both characters are able to reflect on their lifelong friendship and attain a deeper appreciation for each other. Similarly, as Sunakawa helps Yamato with the same matters, they grow to better understand each other and are able to bond through their love\u2014albeit very different forms of love\u2014for Takeo. Although the development between Sunakawa and Yamato is subtle by comparison and mostly implied, it is nonetheless sufficient to establish Takeo, Sunakawa, and Yamato as an inseparable trio. The parting shot that concludes the series, a variation of the final cake image from the opening credits, perfectly illustrates their dynamic by depicting the three cake toppers designed after the characters standing in a row and facing forward, perhaps symbolizing the characters\u2019 love and support for each other and readiness in taking on life\u2019s challenges together.\\n\\n\r\nBy telling the story through a tight-knit trio rather than just a loving couple, the show is able to more gracefully handle the problems that commonly beleaguer its contemporaries. Whereas countless other series bog themselves down by putting the romantic leads through contrived, extended hell from which they have to somehow escape on their own, Ore Monogatari!! generally steers clear of this by primarily relying on Sunakawa and his incredible knack for quickly recognizing and defusing potentially explosive situations. As a result, the typical roadblocks that arise in romance storylines are reduced to trivial speed bumps that are usually passed over within an episode or two, and viewers are not dragged through exhausting, protracted story arcs over small misunderstandings blown out of proportion between inexplicably dense characters.\\n\\n\r\nOre Monogatari!! is a breath of fresh air because of its refusal to bow down to time-honored traditions often found in the genre, allowing three characters to share the spotlight without ever introducing romantic tugs-of-war between any of them. By doing so, the show creates the opportunity to explore the different but equally important forms of love that exist between them and tells a sincere story that deftly avoids the melodrama-filled land mines that litter the paths of so many of its peers.",

The story had me crying happy tears for these two almost the whole time. I don't think I've cried this much over cuteness overload since  Clannad. (Happy tears, not sad. Just noting that.)\r\nThe art may not be some people's cup of tea. But, I think it suited the story. The backgrounds are very pretty. The effects were adorable and sparkly. The opening theme and music were totally perfect. I actually found myself watching the opening at times causeof how cute it was with the song..but, maybe that's just me!\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are totally clueless, but it suites them to boot. The story of how they met was a nice heart warming introduction. The characters play well with each other. The boyfriend is a giant \"bear\" that everyone fears. But, some look up to because of his warm heart. The girlfriend is sweet and can see the beauty in someone, despite the outside appearance. Both very trusting. And, the best friend of the boyfriend is a handsome, but kind and gentle person who really helps push things through. He really is a good best friend, and only the story can really explain it. You have to watch to see!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, The story basically is their cupcake phase, and what most young girls would dream for their first relationship to be like. Each episode always made me smile, and if you like these kinds..I hope you take the time to ride through the whole season!",

            "content": "This is definitely a feel-good anime. There are different aspects to this story that involve other characters that add more entertainment to the main relationship in this show. I personally do not like the main character, Takeo's face, as in that type of art style to the face is not my fave (the exaggerated lips and crazy expressions). I usually want to look at attractive male leads, which is why it took me so long to finally watch it. I actually watched this after watching two \"romance\" animes that left me quite disappointed in the ending cause there was no mutual love!! This seemed likea promising love story so I gave it a chance. I will also like to add that it is also quite funny in addition to getting the love that I was seeking.\\n\\n\r\nThe cuteness of Yamato also is what I enjoyed the most. She is really sweet and caring. I love her. I say if you're also hesitant cause the main character is a little wild looking just know that the entire show does make up for it and he is actually a really good guy.\\n\\n\r\nI am pretty satisfied with the entire show! I recommend watching if you are looking for a sweet, loving, yet funny anime.",

This reminds me of the first time I fell in love. Only bits of it resembled certain situations. \r\nRegardless, don't we all want to live in an ideal world where there is someone who wants us for who we are?\r\nI'd recommend this idealistic slice of life love story.",

I didn't put any explicit spoilers but clues pointing to something might be visible. So here we go..\r\nStory:\r\nWell, there you have it - a good take on the romcom genre with a little deviation from the generic mainstream stuff, this being caused by the gentle touch of shoujo. After watching the first few episodes, I thought there would be a fair amount of turning points but it chose to maintain its slow pace and introduce themonly at times it believes are right. This is why I would say there is almost always so little progression between episodes it'd feel very episodic. Still it managed to be consistent without looking too mechanically repetitive. The core story, although not that great and original, is cute. You might cry, laugh, but most of the time, smile, two kinds of smiles though, the happy smile and the hopeful smile. Sadly, there was LITTERally no major plot, but oh, it all ends with a smile. And oh wait.. didn't I just say it's smiles most of the time? Summing it up, it's good.\\n\r\n--> 7\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI think I'll divide my art rating into subratings:\\n\r\n- drawing: I'm very sure they fit just right with the characters, scenes, and stuff all through (8)\\n\r\n- color: not really expressive but is appropriate when it comes to conveying a certain atmosphere (8)\\n\r\n- animation: the movements, the special effects, they never failed me (8)\\n\r\n--> 8\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI liked how different their voices sounded which only added to the authenticity of the characters themselves. The opening song is adorably catchy and the ending song is just about the same, if not less.\\n\r\n--> 8\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis may come as unbelievable but the main characters are legitimately realistically perfect. Not that they have no flaws or that they're the best, it's just that their goodness really warmed me up. Though it was a medium length of 24 ep, I never really felt any development going on that much, but it does exist. Anyway I might add, Rinko Yamato is my new kawaii idol. The best girl since Rem, the shinigami.\\n\r\n--> 9\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWell, all 24 episodes were like the sun to me, no matter what they're always enjoyable to see and feel.\\n\r\n--> 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nMy overall score is a bit more calculated. I use my own formula:\\n\r\n[story + art + sound + character + enjoyment + (my bias*5)]/10\\n\r\n(see details in my profile)\\n\r\nFor this anime the equation would be:\\n\r\n[7 + 8 + 8 + 9 + 8 + (8*5)]/10 = overall score\\n\r\nwith my bias of 8.\\n\r\n--> 8",

            "content": "When I first saw this anime's synopsis, I thought, \"Wow that's new (sorta), the side character is finally getting some spot light.\" Ore Monogatari certainly has been a unique experience, with a steady combination of good and bad.\r\nStory (6):\r\nThe other reviews gave pretty much an accurate description on the story. Having made a point to mainly stick with rom-coms, I can confidentially say that this story is pretty much like the others. It does not introduce any new elements, but it does use make decent use of the clich\u00e9s. Since this story is mainly about the relationship between the main characters, actual plot includes aslice-of-life standpoint, not necessarily bad, but can get repetitive if you have seen it before.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7):\\n\r\nThe art played a huge role in both the comedy aspect, as well as, bring the show a unique feel to it. Personally, the different faces that Takieo made when talking about Yamato (more so about the \"I Love You\" line in every episode) probably saved me from dropping, and then repeatedly stepping on the lack of word choice the show offered. The art itself was vibrant, which matched the mood of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6):\\n\r\nThe OST, regardless of the genre, is crucial when attempting to develop a mood the creators wants the viewers to feel. While the OST slightly added to the mood, it did not really help set it, nor is it a \"stand-alone\" piece one can listen to. The OP and ED were well suited to every episode, but not really memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7):\\n\r\nRom-coms rely on two things to be successful, unique characters that have a good amount of emotional depth, and the interaction between said characters. While the two main characters (Takieo and Yamato) had a very good development phase, I feel that the side characters were more there for plot progression and nothing more. There was little to no progression on the \"main\" side character Suna, even though he had just as much screen time than the real two main characters. The other sides were either there for filler, or lasted 3-4 episodes to introduce a new element to Takieo's and Yamato's relationship. That being said, the interaction between the characters were more or less fantastic. The comedy between them would have me laughing so hard that I would have to pause to calm down a bit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8):\\n\r\nThe anime meshed with itself rather well, which provided a good comedy with a romance underplot. Any fans of rom-coms, I would recommend picking this up, as it provides a nice light and airy atmosphere, hard found in most anime. If this anime were a food, it would be a waffle. It looks interesting with all the toppings on it, which some tasted well together, while others didn't, but when you finished, you were full and satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7):\\n\r\nThis anime seemed to waste time adding characters to further plot devices, rather than adding depth to the characters already there. But with the variety of characters, you got to see how interesting it was for the male lead to interact with a seemingly everyday life.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThe afternoon October air is chilly, cold enough to make the use of a jacket mandatory. Despite the temperature, the butterflies refused to cease their fluttering. First, a restaurant dinner. Second, a stroll through the park. Third, a comfy movie. And now fourth, a shopping trip through the city. It is our fourth date, you think to yourself, calm down already! The butterflies do not listen.\r\nYou are waiting near the agreed-upon fountain, an easy marker to find among the large crowd of people. You start to scan for her face, jumping while doing so both toget a better view and to heat you up. Finally, you opt to stand on the edge of the fountain, the butterflies making it easier to make that step up. Just as you do so, you see her. A rose among daffodils. She is wearing jeans, a button up coat, and glinting earrings, her long, brown hair resting gracefully on her back.\\n\\n\r\nShe is looking around; you hope she is looking for you. When her eyes lock with yours, they gleam brighter than the stones on her ears. She pushes past the crowd as you float down from off the fountain\u2019s edge. When she reaches you, October turns to April, her wonderful smile warming you from within.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYou look\u2026great,\u201d you manage to exhale, her radiance momentarily stealing your breath. Her cheeks grow rosier as she casts her head down. You think you might have said something wrong, but suddenly she lifts her head back up while standing slightly on her toes to kiss you. The kiss does not last long, but the softness and the sweetness calms the butterflies completely. When she pulls away, your smile mirrors her own. You reach for her hand, her and your fingers interlacing instinctively. The feeling within you is something you have never felt before, but you know that, like the girl standing next to you, you never want to let it go.\\n\\n\r\nLove is a beautiful thing, something that everyone deserves to experience. Filled with romance, skip-a-beat situations, and of course love, Ore Monogatari!! delivers this message with all its heart.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nOre Monogatari does not have a plot. That is a half-truth: the plot exists within the first three or so episodes, but after Takeo and Rinko officially start dating, the anime transitions into more or less a slice-of-life show that focuses on love and all that that means.\\n\\n\r\nAs Haddaway would ask, \u201cWhat is love?\u201d Love is a fickle creature that comes and goes, can be found in all shapes and sizes, and has the strange property of being understood by anyone, no matter the culture, location, or upbringing. Love is an emotion, a feeling that resonates with the soul and strains the heart. On its own, love is a purely serene entity. But what surrounds it is hardship, sadness, and turmoil. This is what makes love so sweet: getting past the hard, outer shell and finding that gentle, inner beauty.\\n\\n\r\nThus Ore Monogatari centers in on this beauty. Looking at every angle of romance is how the anime accomplishes this goal. The show showcases the initial nervousness and anxiety of people who have a crush on one another. Then it demonstrates worry and pain, followed by a period of time where meeting-up becomes infrequent. Afterwards going on dates, caring for the people around them besides just each other, and outside crushes wanting in are more instances of the anime trying \u2013 and succeeding \u2013 at revealing as many sides to romance as possible. With each passing scenario, the audience learns more about love than previously known, thereby moving the anime that much closer towards its own goal. Ore Monogatari also contains large milestones: overcoming the confession, having that first kiss, and (relative to anime) using the girlfriend\u2019s first name. These bigger moments are interspersed throughout the tale, giving a sort of rising and falling action of the events. That is to say, lesser romance ideas are had, then a greater one, proceeded by lesser romance ideas again, and so on. This kind of progression slowly increases love\u2019s boundaries, but that is how love is. Love is nurtured, a delicate flower that blooms into elegance the more it is cared for.\\n\\n\r\nCaring does not only exist between Takeo and Rinko. Cleverly, the anime involves the rest of the cast in the love-filled festivities, therefore exploring the theme even more. Oda loves Suna\u2019s older sister but is blocked by her feelings for Takeo. Takeo\u2019s afro friend hooks up with one of Rinko\u2019s friends after the two realize that the other person is not always perfect. Ichinose\u2019s confession gives Rinko the opportunity to show the existence of true, everlasting love. The plot takes the time to displace love away from the main couple now and again, and in doing so the anime explores love through a wider lens, thus expounding on its theme of love that much more.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the best scenario from the entire season also does not directly revolve around Takeo and Rinko. Instead, it is the arc starring Suna and Yukika, the Valentine\u2019s letter girl. This scenario is wonderful for one reason: Suna rejects Yukika. It is a poignant moment but it is so powerful because it rounds out love\u2019s complexity. Someone might love another but that does not automatically mean the love has to be reciprocated. The aftermath, though, does not defeat Yukika. Rather, it invigorates her to try harder, to become someone better than herself. As for Suna, he continues being himself while emphasizing that love is not something to rush into. Collectively, the arc, and especially the direction the arc takes, proves how well the anime explores its theme of love.\\n\\n\r\nOre Monogatari also, in order to fully explore its theme, targets love that exists between other couplings, meaning not just between two people who have fallen for one another. The biggest example is Takeo and Suna. The former is there to support his friend during trying family times. The latter patiently listens, providing wisdom to his friend when he needs it (and he needs it often). For both, the love they share is that of best friends, the kind of connection that only the best of buds are capable of understanding. Takeo\u2019s mother demonstrates the love for a son and vice versa. Suna and Ai demonstrate the love between siblings, and so on. Thus the anime, combined with its other areas, explores love as completely as it can, clearly demonstrating the show\u2019s total strength.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s extensive use of love can be viewed metaphorically. The anime is a heart, each ventricle a new arc, each pump a new set of events, and each beat a new feeling. Like any heart, though, defects exist. Most prominent is the repetitiveness. For the comedy, it often relies on the same jokes: Takeo saying \u201cI love her\u201d alongside an imaginative concept, Rinko getting embarrassed when dealing with normal activities, and Suna acting unfazed by much of the stuff that happens around him. For the general proceedings, it often relies on the same direction: Takeo going beyond superhuman to help out his girlfriend, Rinko frequently giving a beaming smile for the audience to imprint on their mind, and Suna always tagging along.\\n\\n\r\nTo clarify, the repetitiveness does not affect the events themselves; the theme of love is explored nicely precisely because Ore Monogatari varies up the surrounding situations consistently. Repetitiveness is not automatically a negative, but since the show does not use the repetition in a meaningful manner, it comes off as obtrusive rather than constructive. In a way, though, such repetition is natural: a heart beats and beats and beats. A heart repeatedly goes through its motions, involuntarily and forever. In the realistic case, however, the heart\u2019s repetition is mandatory. In Ore Monogatari\u2019s case, not so much.\\n\\n\r\nStill, this heart is healthy enough to keep going, carrying love to every part of itself without fail.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOre Monogatari sticks with a \u201clighter\u201d art style throughout the season. Most of the show takes place during the day with bountiful sunlight. When nighttime is shown, streetlamps, the moon, and other lighting fixtures \u2013 such as Christmas lights and at-home bulbs \u2013 brighten the area. The purpose: to keep the anime cheerful in atmosphere. After all, love is ultimately a happy and fulfilling emotion, so maintaining a cheery mood coincides with the show\u2019s own goals.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is also diverse in the backgrounds it uses. A local zoo, the beach, parts of the city, a nearby mountain trail, their apartments, and an amusement park are all visited, giving the anime a dynamic feel and therefore a feeling of liveliness. Again, these types of feelings are important since they match the theme of love that permeates the show. Alongside the realistic backgrounds are the imaginative ones. These usually happen when one of the gang \u2013 especially Takeo \u2013 starts to think about something intently \u2013 in Takeo\u2019s case, Rinko. They can take on any form, from planets to European landscapes, but they are always quite detailed.\\n\\n\r\nDetailed as well are the character designs, Takeo in particular for his given size. Of course, he is massive, the anime using this feature of his for comedic effect at most points. But his size has two other purposes. One, his size forms a dichotomy with Rinko\u2019s short stature \u2013 thinking about love, \u201copposites attract.\u201d And two, his hugeness represents the size of his heart \u2013 he is the very definition of a gentle giant. His huge lips, short hair, and squinty eyes continue to paint him as the lovable dude that he is. Also lovable is Rinko, her large eyes, beaming smile, and natural blushing making her undeniably cute. Better yet, the show constantly switches her design, changing her hair-do and outfit for a myriad of occasions, giving her a varied set of appearances to show off her cuteness. As for Suna, he is known for his extreme handsomeness derived from his extreme plainness. His hair is normal, his eyes are normal, and his face is normal, turning him into a \u201creal\u201d person. And that is the point: Suna, given his role, is the \u201codd man out\u201d in the sense that Takeo\u2019s overt largeness and Rinko\u2019s overt adorableness are accentuated when the completely plain Suna is nearby. The rest of the cast is similarly detailed in their designs: Takeo\u2019s father with his strangely off-kilter looks, Rinko\u2019s friends with their different getups, and Suna\u2019s sister with her aura of maturity, giving the character designs a higher overall amount of execution.\\n\\n\r\nExecution persists in the actual animation. Facial expressions for Takeo and Rinko morph constantly, hair and limbs move when speaking, and objects shift when used throughout the season. Small effects like glinting stars or contorting lips and more involved scenarios like Takeo jumping out of a burning building or Takeo running down the side of a mountain (the majority of the more animation-intensive segments have Takeo performing some unbelievable feat) keep the anime\u2019s actual animation high despite how much it relies on capturing singular, still-frame moments during the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe art elevates itself further with even more features. The show includes visible writing, where a character\u2019s current thoughts pop up next to him or her rather than said out loud in order to understand what he or she is thinking without taking away from the current situation. Comedy-oriented designs, such as minimalist portraits or wacky faces, maintain the show\u2019s fun atmosphere. And the anime\u2019s minute details, such as the defined lines of Takeo\u2019s and the other characters faces and the expert use of shadows, cement Ore Monogatari as an anime whose artistic and animation direction was always given special attention from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nOre Monogatari has a sizeable cast but more or less focuses on three characters in particular: Takeo, Rinko, and Suna, or colloquially the brawn, the beauty, and the brains.\\n\\n\r\nAs a kid, Takeo grew up surrounded by friends and family, his kindhearted behavior naturally attracting people to him. However he was never popular with girls, mostly because of his size and his often crazy actions. But after protecting Rinko, he (and she) found love, providing him with the relationship he had always wanted. Understandably, then, Takeo is not the best when it comes to love and how to handle it: he sometimes does not speak his mind, he often reads Rinko\u2019s thoughts wrong, and he regularly misunderstands what has happened or what he can do. Still, Takeo never lets his shortcomings deter him. Instead he takes his love for Rinko as fuel to treat her and their relationship with as much respect and care as humanly \u2013 in this context, Takeo-ly \u2013 possible. So he tries his hardest at a judo match to make his time away from Rinko purposeful, he studies his mind out to go to the same university as his girlfriend, and he supports Rinko at her new job to boost her confidence in her own skills. Takeo is a man that always has others \u2013 especially Rinko \u2013 in his thoughts, with his actions, his monologues, and his disposition always demonstrating his never-ending love.\\n\\n\r\nRinko is similar in the sense that she deeply loves Takeo. Rinko makes him desserts nearly daily, she declares her feelings as clear as day, and she is always doing her best to push her and Takeo\u2019s relationship forward. This last point is important: knowing that Takeo is the ignorant one when it comes to love, it falls on Rinko to take the initiative, which she does in stunning fashion. Rinko tries to make Takeo\u2019s heart \u201cskip a beat\u201d at the beach, she rests on his chest to snuggle with him, and she leans in first for that first kiss. Rinko, not Takeo, leads the relationship where it needs to go. This stems from her \u201cnon-pure\u201d motives, an early spot of conflict for her character. Initially she believed that her wanting to hold hands or hold Takeo was a turn off to him due to his constant praising of her innocent nature. But such desires are perfectly fine for anyone, especially when said person is in love. So for Rinko, her more instinctual feelings are not a detriment but rather a boon that makes her relationship with Takeo slowly but surely evolve beyond what it has already become.\\n\\n\r\nThe advancement of their relationship is necessary considering that their relationship is technically the main focus of the anime. Watching as Takeo and Rinko fall for one another, care for one another, and of course love one another is what allows their individual characters to blossom. And like their character designs, \u201copposites attract,\u201d meaning the kind of give and take they share is opposite to how they are perceived as being. For example, Takeo is huge but treats Rinko like a delicate flower when he refrains from ogling her body in a swimsuit. Rinko, likewise, is tiny but is not afraid to make moves that are bigger than herself when she kisses Takeo on the cheek when he is sleeping soundly. While they, at times, act differently towards each other than they do to the people around them, there is one area where they agree wholeheartedly: trust. Takeo trusts Rinko and Rinko trusts Takeo. Saijou might confess her feelings towards her \u201cMaster\u201d and Ichinose might confess his feelings towards his \u201cmuse,\u201d but both Takeo and Rinko know that they will never lose sight of the love they mutually have for one another.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Takeo and Rinko\u2019s relationship cannot survive on its own; indeed, their relationship would never have come to fruition without the aid of a particular male. Perhaps obviously, this person is none other than Suna. Arguably the strongest character of Ore Monogatari, Suna is their rock. Suna is not so much a third wheel as he is the spokes that support the lovebirds. When Takeo needs help planning a date or needs to express himself using emoticons, Suna is the first person he goes to. When Rinko needs advice on how to get closer to Takeo or needs ideas on what cake to make for Takeo\u2019s birthday, Suna is the first person she goes to. Suna is always there for them, ready with wisdom to set them (and anyone, really) down the path of success. That is to say, as a person he is not just respectful but immeasurably kind.\\n\\n\r\nKindness alone, though, does not make a character strong. Unlike Takeo, Rinko, and many other members of the cast, he does not have those feelings of love. In fact, it is the opposite: despite how many women have approached him, he has never returned their feelings. Like Rinko\u2019s base desires, this is normal. Suna\u2019s decision to not have a lover is the anime yet again exploring its theme of love, but more profound than this is what this means for his character. Suna does not have a partner to share his time with, so the relationships he has with both Takeo and Rinko mean the world to him. Suna does not help them out because he is obligated; he helps them out because he values them and the bond they share. He is thankful that Takeo makes him laugh when Takeo simply acts like himself. He is thankful to Rinko for showing him sides of his best friend that he has never seen before. Thus he repays their own kindness with kindness of his own, to prove that they are the people in his life he loves deeply.\\n\\n\r\nThis is not to say that Suna does not have personal troubles of his own. Early in the season, Suna\u2019s father has health issues that force him into the hospital, thereby affecting Suna immensely. Later in the season, Suna has a potential love interest that could be the correct match for him. Therefore Takeo and Rinko, respective to these situations, support Suna, helping him to overcome the struggles he faces both within and without. Thus Suna is not the only one supporting; Takeo and Rinko in turn support him. Collectively, the three of them love each other in a way that is appropriate for the bonds they share, their overall relationship highlighting the beauty of love. To put it differently: uniquely and cleverly, Takeo, Rinko, and Suna are not a typical love triangle.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme for Ore Monogatari is a treat for the ears. The range of the vocalist, the strange sound effects in the background, and the dropping beat make the arrangement playful, energetic, and fun. Alongside the beginning piano, the intermittent choir, and the concluding guitar, the entire piece is filled with love both in the sound it oozes and in the feeling it exudes, making it a perfect fit for the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme, opposing its OP counterpart, slows everything down, both in beat and in tone. The piece embraces simplicity, guitar, drums, and a singer making up the majority of the track. However, this piece is arguably filled with more heart; the build-up, the lyrics, and the instruments initially generate a distinct feeling of longing that, at just the right moment, gives way to elation. Metaphorically, the piece feels as if someone has gone a long time searching for love, finding out that it was closer to him than he had ever thought possible, making the ED another perfect outing.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack consists of both serene and poignant pieces that touch the heart and move the soul. \u201cFond Memories\u201d is a slow and heavy piano that really does instill a sense of nostalgia for those reflecting moments in the show. \u201cOre no Tatakai,\u201d with its violins and trumpets, pumps one\u2019s adrenaline for those intense scenes. \u201cStory of Mind ~ Little Love\u201d is a beautiful, and indeed tiny, piece that is filled to the brim with happiness and joy to match those likewise joyous occasions. \u201cYou made my day\u201d has flutes and a choir that make it feel as if heaven itself has descended, making the heartfelt times that much heartier. And \u201cScenery\u201d has a particular gentleness that soothes the mind upon every listen.\\n\\n\r\nBesides these dramatic pieces, the anime can get less serious and more comical with others, such as \u201cBajitoufuu\u201d with its drawling beat or \u201cHaru no Kaze\u201d with its dual guitars upping the mood considerably. Or the show can give that slice-of-life feel that the anime has with tracks like \u201cHot Hitoiki\u201d that combine a piano with guitars to create quite the relaxing melody. But no matter the track, the OST consistently brings about amazing tunes that improve the anime and are more than worthy of a listen outside of it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, the performances given are above average, demonstrating once again the high amount of execution Ore Monogatari holds. Takuya Eguchi as Takeo provides stunning voice work, achieving a voice for the overly burly man that is simultaneously gruff, strong, and caring. Megumi Han as Rinko gives cuteness in droves when she speaks, but it is her girly screams that solidify her place as the adorable Rinko. And Nobunaga Shimazaki as Suna brings calmness but also genuine laughter when appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThe romance connoisseur that I am, this anime was right up my alley from the get-go. Watching as Takeo and Rinko fell in love, all of the smiles and laughs that they shared, and the wonderful milestones they reached as a couple made me so happy to see. The blushing, the hand holding, the genuine emotions; the more their relationship grew, the more ecstatic I became, and since their relationship progressed at a nominal pace, so did the romance and therefore my happiness.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the repetition being a negative, I was still happy to hear Taeko say \u201cI love you\u201d every single time because I knew that it was either proceeded or followed by Rinko giving the most sincere smile any person ever could, which in turn made me smile even more. This leads into Rinko\u2019s overall adorableness. No matter what she said or what she did, she always managed to make me giggle like a little school girl. Whether she moved behind a nearby pillar at light speed when Takeo turned to look at her or she was stifling her ghosts to stop them from waking her boyfriend, Rinko made the show into the cute powerhouse that it ended up being.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also nailed its comedy. Situations like Ai getting angry towards Oda, the doctor getting spun around so much he puked (twice), and Saijou crying her eyes out on a bench were hilarious to see unfold. Furthermore, Rinko once again does wonders, such as when she is accurate yet misleading in her description of her nighttime escapade with Takeo or when she could barely contain her excitement while holding Takeo\u2019s new baby sister. Takeo as well, with his overreactions when seeing Rinko in her bathing suit or practicing his kissing technique with Suna. Suna, too, which is surprising given his lax behavior, but it is precisely because he more or less goes with the flow that made many of his moments so hilarious. Suna nonchalantly reacting to the stuff around him or him remembering that kissing session made him funny in his own way. From the romance to the cuteness to the comedy, the anime was a fully entertaining experience from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nOre Monogatari!! has one idea in mind: love. Its narrative focuses on this theme, its characters share this feeling between each other, and its art and its music are steeped in love, too. From top to bottom, left to right, and forward to back, love permeates throughout the anime, coming in all shapes and sizes. Love is definitely something everyone needs to experience, but until the real thing appears on a chilly October afternoon, this one will more than make do.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, exploration of love is thorough, repetition at times lessening the experience\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, wonderful art, from the backgrounds to the character designs to the minute details, sits alongside above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Takeo\u2019s gentleness, Rinko\u2019s boldness, and Suna\u2019s kindness exemplify love, both on its own and between each other\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, great OP, great ED, very nice OST, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, romance galore, combined with so much adorableness and laughs, created a ride that never stopped being fun\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "This doesn't include any story summaries. Also no spoilers. So let's get to the review.. I mean personal opinion ;)\r\nIn a nutshell:\r\nOre Monogatari!! is a fun romantic story with ample moe, romance, reality, and relationship in different levels (if you think that way). It's all there under one package and because of its wide palette of enjoyment, many people find this show enjoyable to some degree, but doesn't like it enough to say that it had left an impact, for it is too wide as themes are concerned. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nA refreshing and relaxing plot. Not a tear-jerk er or chair-grabber. But a fair romantic story.The first episode was introduce mystery with the ogre tale, but we understand.. I was skeptical at first when the confession occurred at the starting episodes before exploring into individual characters.  But it turned out to be rather great. There is a mix of humor, anime stuff, reality and bit mystery for some, which makes it a complete package. The first half of the series was the best part. I felt the later last few episodes to be a pain in the ass. I was bit curious about the ending; but the anime failed to entertain me there. I didn't expect much anyway.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nA unique color palette from Madhouse. Not a fan of it though but acceptable. The pop'in colors suit the romantic mood. The character animation is little wired in way that its unique when coupled along with the unique color pallet. Not that its awful, but gets used to after few episodes. There is attention to detail and some scenes are well rendered. The romantic and expression scenes are flashy and there's is lot of moe theme visually going on, again makes the show unique in it's own way.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nGood voice acting. The OP and ED is truly awesome. The melody is catching for me. The humor scenes are made enjoyable thanks to the great effort put forward by the voice actors. It's not a break through voicing as a whole but is great considering the impact on overall enjoyment delivered. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters are unique and well established. Though the same cannot be said for all of them, some were under developed for obvious reasons. Suna being mysterious and silent is a great move considering the anime's success. The less someone talks, the more thinking can be left to the remaining cast and viewers, so the story can keep going. Some characters that appeared at the later half of the series failed to be as interesting as they were portrait to be. I believe this is because these characters don't 'fit in' with the main cast or the story associated with them was in short 'boring'. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nAs i mentioned earlier, the first half was very enjoyable. i laughed hard in most of the episodes. But the level of humor faded along the last few episodes. But overall, it was quiet an enjoyable show i could savor in a long time. Thanks to the art and voicing, the enjoyment was 10x.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6.6/10",

And that should be fine.\r\nThe romance scenes are overdone. They are too excessive in my opinion, and are really quite distracting. Second, the character development is mainly nonexistent. They are not quite complex and can easily be described in a couple word.\r\nFinally, the art was fine, the story, even for a Slice of Life/Romance, was rubbish, because there was hardly even the slightest attempt at an arc. The \"drama\" was resolved almost instantly andwas close to insignificant.",

            "content": "I just finished watching Ore Monogatari!! and I don't really know how I feel about it so I had to write this.\r\nStory (5):\r\nShoujo is my type of anime. I love romance, and also comedy. So Ore Monogatari!! should be perfect for me, isn't it? Well.\r\nTakeo saves Yamato from being molested and they fall in love (at first sight I guess), and soon after they will be in a relationship. What happens next? A lot of things, and also nothing at all.\r\nThe main problem I have with Ore Monogatari!! is that the story doesn't develop AT ALL. I got so bored of waiting for something tohappen that I had to take several breaks from this series. Also, the writers must have thought that introducing new characters was a good idea, but in the next two episodes they were gone for good (without making any relevant changes to the story). The same happened with some of the sub-stories. That was a huge let-down for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (9): \\n\r\nEven if the story is lacking in many ways, you kind of forget. The art made me connect with Takeo (because the series was focused on him). It made me feel and understand how he was feeling. (Of course, it gets repetitive, but it didn't fail to make me laugh).\\n\r\nIt is incredibly well drawn, detailed, vibrant. Colors, backgrounds, characters; everything is great. I loved it. I loved it so much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (6):\\n\r\nIt wasn't memorable. The opening and ending were good, but nothing spectacular. I want to emphasize the work that Takuya Eguchi did giving voice to Takeo, it was very good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7):\\n\r\nTakeo: he just really loves Yamato, and he will make sure you know it. He isn't like any of those other shoujo boys. He is different, not only in looks. He isn't afraid to show his feelings, he's honest. He doesn't treat Yamato like crap. He actually takes into account her feelings, makes her feel important, protects her, shows everyone their love. You know how great it is to have a main character like him in shoujo? He puts everyone above himself, it doesn't matter if it's his best friend or his rival. He has a heart of gold and it shows.\\n\\n\r\nYamato: our main girl isn't like your typical shoujo girl either (well, maybe in looks). Yes, she is cute, and yes, she is innocent. But she is brave, she's determined, she knows what she wants. She often gets eclipsed by Takeo tho, because, let's be honest, he's the star of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSuna: calm, handsome, mysterious, it's hard to tell what he's thinking. You know, typical shoujo boy, except that he's just a supporting character (even if they want to categorize him as \"main\"). There's not much to say about him, since there is little to no backstory or development, which is a disappointment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7):\\n\r\nIt was okay most of the time but I got bored a lot, especially during the first part of the series. It's fun, but it gets repetitive; it's cute too, but sometimes it gets irritating (it's okay Takeo, we know that you love Yamato).\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7):\\n\r\nIt was good. If you're looking for something deep, definitely don't watch this anime. If you want to watch a lighthearted, funny, calming love story, give it an opportunity.\\n\r\nIt teachs you a couple of valuable lessons and it will make your heart warm. I can't be sad that I finished this series, but I'm not happy either. It just wasn't enough for me. I need development!! Characters that contribute to the main story!!!! Something else!!!!!!\\n",

            "content": "You\u2019re a kid, you\u2019re a squid, you\u2019re a kid- Oh wrong series - My Love Story review\r\nOne of My Love Story\u2019s strongest elements is how well crafted and executed the story and characters are, regardless of the supposed cliches and many nitpicks I\u2019ve seen in reviews for this show. Its cheese lies subtly in its favor. We\u2019re introduced to a cast that each have their own unique characters to them, while nothing innovating, it all interconnects their relationship and development in a heartfelt way. From the reviews I\u2019ve read, it\u2019s mostly underdeveloped short introductions rather than an actual review. And highly lacks any depth oranalysis to convey an overall legitimate point. Mini rant over, onto the review.\\n\\n\r\nMy Love Story begins when our main protagonist, Gouda Takeo saves the Yamato Rinko from a groper on a train. Thus ushering the flattering romantic comedy. The show is mostly an episodic series that touches on moments for us to understand and appreciate the relationship between Takeo and Sunakawa, and Takeo\u2019s bond with Yamato. In the beginning we are given a touching analogy of two ogre friends that conveys the bromance and challenges Takeo faces on a daily basis. Sunakawa is a friend that always has his friend\u2019s back and accumulates his advice from simply watching people throughout his childhood, understanding the psychology behind people\u2019s action in order to help his thick headed friend, Takeo. This is prominent throughout the show and shows that more to a book than its cover. In each episode we learn about our main character and how he became the person he is, how he reflects himself not because of others, but because of the actions he takes. I didn\u2019t find comedy superbly funny but it makes the moments much more sweeter, creating and immersing conclusive endings to a conflict. There are plentiful of visceral moments that bile up heart wrenching excitement to portray Takeo in a positive manner and gain respect from people who wouldn\u2019t have or didn\u2019t otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation are pretty good. There were times when I noticed some slightly odd and derpy drawings, specifically of characters in far shots. Sunakawa just looked awful. There are more stagnate moments than action sequences so you shouldn\u2019t expect much from the animation department, not to downplay it, it is good, just not Fate Stay Night Unlimited Budget level. Onto sound, again, it\u2019s not at all amazing or WOW! like Tokyo Ghoul\u2019s epic soundtrack that it doesn\u2019t earn because the anime fails to tell a complete narrative. Or even Wolf\u2019s Rain, another anime that I\u2019m a bit mixed if it even earns such a FANTASTIC soundtrack for an above average show. I digress, anyhow, I still noticed it enough to convey the cute moments and intimate scenes. The opening was okay to me; it fits well with the anime. The ending on the other hand, I thought brought in a vibe of friendship that you\u2019ll have only between a few friends. The love and caress of those who truly respect and love you. Voice acting did a nice job in consistency with the character design and really matched with the characters. Overall, sound does good job integrating in the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters can be easily summed up as cliche and generic, but what does that even mean if you just took it out of its context just to bitch about it. Gouda Takeo is your gorilla sized man with a huge heart. He has this charisma and hint of calmness to him that exasperates a gentle soul. Even as a nice person as he is, there are people that talk behind his back because of his appearance. Takeo can be simply stated to be a character putting up a front or some other wacky nit pick, but in what we\u2019re shown, there\u2019s no point in him getting mad or lose esteem. He is well aware of his surroundings and doesn\u2019t let small talk affect him. Takeo\u2019s bromance with Sunakawa has got to be one of the best I\u2019ve seen since Free!. Sunakawa is an awesome supporting character to Takeo. He is always on the sideline watching and observing people in order to understand the situation and then giving his thought and solution. He\u2019s the friend that will always have your back. His reasoning for not dating any girls or liking is the fact that he don\u2019t like no hoes talking shit about his friend behind his back. Bruh, that\u2019s just cool. His calm and understanding nature assists in good balance to Takeo\u2019s thick headedness and even Yamato\u2019s ignorance. Ah, Yamato, of all the squeaky characters I\u2019ve been killed until deaf ears, I surprisingly and pleasantly found her to be quite a joy. Not one moment did I find her annoying because of how well her character is in relations to Takeo and Yamato, as well as how cheesy she is with her friends. It\u2019s moments like these that even the stuff I hate the most, I can love. Yamato is the pillar to Takeo\u2019s character change and the flaws within him. She is able to bring out the \u2018real\u2019 human inside of him. From there, we see him do and say things he normally wouldn\u2019t say such as the whole issue with the patisserie dude, Ichinose, of which he found himself to be fine even if Yamato ever left him for someone else. Though we already know no character is without flaw, this shows Takeo\u2019s true nature, that he can feel stress, doubt, and pain for someone so optimistic as him.\\n\\n\r\n There are some criticisms that I have to say, though nothing major enough that it\u2019ll deflect the score of the show. The last two episodes with Ichinose, while I thought it showed the human side of Takeo, it was a bit too underwhelming in impact as a narrative and it felt a little rush to me. But it still concluded good enough to show what they wanted to show. The whole situation with Yukika Amami I thought showed good development for her and Sunakawa but it felt like Snafu with the whole uncertainty, no answer situation. I don\u2019t know. I feel like I just had to complain somehow. \\n\\n\r\nMy Love Story manages to efficiently utilize simple character traits and offer a new perspective of the romantic comedy genre. The character relationships are open and gives us answers to situations between characters most other shows bother to drag out for long durations. Or never to hear at all. That is why this show earns a 8/10, and just misses the benchmark for my badass seal of approval. But it is a show that I can recommend to anyone who isn\u2019t a diehard shoujo fan because apparently they are the experts in nitpicking the basic traits but never explaining in context of the story and overall narrative, why exactly?

            "content": "Ore Monogatari!! is a series that looks unconventional at first glance but a second look reveals that it adheres to every trope of romance animes.\r\nPlot arcs with misunderstanding as the foundation? Check.\r\nThird parties? Check.\r\nImpossibly optimistic leads? Check.\r\nUnsubstantial episodic fluff? Check.\r\nThe characters are also not Ore Monogatari!!'s strengths. Takeo's unconventional looks for a male shoujo lead feels gimmicky. While it's true that he was ridiculed by the girls he liked back then, it was glossed over and the series portrayed him as a someone who is much loved by everyone. Swap him to a bland looking guy  but retain his behavior and we will stillget the same results. Suna is the most interesting character in the series for being observant while emotionally distant but was not given proper development. Yamato was not given much task aside from being cute and a doting girlfriend.\\n\\n\r\nYou cannot also rely on the show's humor as it borders too much on slapstick or events which require the audience's suspension of disbelief (Takeo's blissful ignorance of a 'university exclusively for females' and the restaurant incident.) There are also some episodes that are reminiscent of countless romantic anime before and bore the heck out of the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nNo major conflict occurred in this series which might shake Yamato and Takeo's relationship. What we received is their daily fluff that while admittedly sweet, is never substantial. Yet to dismiss Ore Monogatari!! as bland is also not warranted as it shows occasional moments of excellence.\\n\\n\r\nThe musical score of Ore Monogatari!! was one of the year's most moving and was used in perfect timing with emotional scenes. The voice actors also did their best (although Takeo sounds grating at times) to bring these characters to life. Ore Monogatari!! is also a rare case where the ED is much better than the OP.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it gets its groove, it really stands out. In Ore Monogatari!!'s defense, it only took three episodes before Takeo and Yamato became a couple in the most awkward yet endearing way possible. The poignant scenes in this series are really moving and hit the right spot for shoujo junkies. The couple's technically second kiss counts as one of the finest moment of 2015. However, episodes revolving the side characters (Suna's sister, Shijou and Yamato's friend) and Suna are the better representatives of this genre for being believable and well-developed characters. \\n\\n\r\nThese flashes of brilliance do not absolve this series for playing too safe and for following religiously to the tropes which made the shoujo genre dull.  So probably, maybe, it will be a long time before a series can dethrone Kimi Ni Todoke as my most favorite conventional shoujo series.",

            "content": "Whenever people ask me what kind of anime I watch to make me happy, Ore Monogatari!! is one of the first thoughts that goes through my mind.\r\nThe story is rather simple, but rather than having a romance slowly start existing between the characters and maybe starting a relationship at the last two episodes, this anime dares to have a relationship started as soon as possible. This makes for an unique experience in the romance genre, or at least something you don't see very often.\r\nThe sound and art compliment the light-heartedness of the show very well, and they truly capture the 'feel good' premise this animesets. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not very relatable, but they are definitely interesting enough to keep you watching. They're somewhat out of the ordinary, but that keeps them entertaining, which is this show's main purpose.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would most definitely recommend this if you are a fan of romance, or if you are looking for something light-hearted after watching something a little 'heavier'. If you're looking for drama or feels, you won't really find them here, but that's why I like this anime in particular. It treads out of the ordinary, and therefore accomplishes something different, yet very enjoyable.",

This story is mainly about when  one likes someone, everything about the person just seem nice, which truly displays the idiom \"Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder\".  Unlike the typical romance series where the guy/girl overcome uncertainties to chase after a girl/boy he/she likes, this is mainly about a very nice and huge guy getting a cute girlfriend and their experiences. \r\nTo be honest it's worse than the slice of life I tend to enjoy, such as non non biyori or Flying witch. It lacks content for me to continueon and finish the whole series. But for those who enjoy very very very peaceful, very high level slice of life romance, this might be your cup of tea.",

The show talks about a student, Takeo Gouda, who from my point of view has the initials to spell out Tall Gorilla, as you will understand after watching the show, with his friend Makoto Sunakawa and unravel the plot of how Takeo falls in love with Rinko Yamato,an epic girl who just doesn't let you down and lives up to the expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThe story talks about their nearly-everyday encounters and how their relationship develops, which to me, represents the best thing about this show. This is for people who love romance and that only. Don't expect a lot of drama as there isn't any much of it. Instead of making this a novel of a review, in a nutshell, the show is great for romance lovers and, personally, I think it delivers nearly everything that someone's looking for romance will be looking for.\\n\\n\r\nI really am looking forward for the release of a sequel or at least an ova of some kind. I hope you'll enjoy the show as much as i did.",

We\u00b4ll see.\r\nCASE: Ore Monogatari!!\r\n### as shoujo as it can get # # #\r\n+++ PRO +++\r\n#Heartwarming \r\n#Easy story\r\n#Fluttery feelings\r\n#Fun\r\n#Relaxing\r\n#Drama free zone\r\n#Somewhat unordinary romance\r\n#Beautiful art with flowers, bubbles and lots of colours\r\n- - -  CON - - -\r\n#Plain characters\r\n#Character development kind off lacking\r\n#Lots of episodes yet nothing seems to happen in terms of character, plot and relationship development\r\n#Female lead was one of the worse characters\r\n#Starts well but falls off\r\nConclusion:\r\nFirst off I may add that this showis as shoujo as it can get. Bubbles, colours and flowers everywhere. Yay !!!\\n\r\nMy first impression after 2-3 episodes was: \u201eWow this is truly great. It feels different and I like the characters a lot!\u201c\\n\r\nWhat started out as a simple yet charming and heartwarming love story caught my interest pretty damn fast and gave me fluttery feelings, aswell as happiness and a good dose of laughter. But beware. \\n\r\nYou may get the impression that this is something else, however after many episodes you will notice how generic and cliche it really is. It\u00b4s in no regard something special. \\n\r\nSince this series is on the longer end the simplicity and plainness got to much for me. I like slice of life, but I have to admit that it became a little bit boring and repetitiv. What\u00b4s  lacking is  more depth in our characters as well as some good developement. \\n\r\nI understand, that\u00b4s  not what this anime is trying to be. Here I would advice the viewer to take it bite by bite like a delicious pastry from a famous cook. You wouldn\u00b4t swallow that in one take right? That\u00b4s probably the approach we have to take in this anime, to counter the simplicity and to enjoy the positive aspects of the show to their fullest potential. These aspects like charm and humour make it great. It\u00b4s a very positive vibe throughout the show.\\n\r\nFurthermore I really wish we would have seen more development in the romantic relationship.  They are so head over heels right from the start, yet too pure and innocent. A few more kisses and hugs here and there wouldn\u00b4t have hurt anyone. That`s the spirit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlright Kokosnuss, enough stories about pastries and famous cooks. Tell me who is it for?\\n\\n\r\nWell I\u00b4d say for...\\n\\n\r\n+ Shoujo lovers\\n\r\n+ Romance lovers\\n\r\n+ If you got bored from standard romance shit\\n\r\n+ If you prefer seeing a harmonic couple rather than some ntr, forced drama and unrequited love BS\\n\r\n+ If you like pastries\\n\r\n+ If you are ready for our bear like, 2 meters tall, fat lipped, deep voiced male mc and his cute, little, doll like, pastry baking, charming girlfriend\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd not so much...\\n\\n\r\n- if you can\u00b4t take the huge amount of sweetnes (if you already have diabetes take care, you might not surive)\\n\r\n-If you wish for a more demanding story \\n\r\n(yes this one is sweet, but it could be too boring for some)\\n\r\n- if you dislike bear or gorilla like male mc\u00b4s and prefer the slender female looking, glass wearing, pale and whiney ass generic one that the anime gods have cursed us with.\\n\r\n(God bless, we truly live in dark ages nowadays)\\n\\n\\n\r\n# # # CASE Closed.

            "content": "Why does it always take me so long to watch shows that I'll love. Why.\r\nStory 10/10: I love how this show doesn't spend all of its time on a 'will-they-won't-they' story, because, as much fun as those kinds of shows are, there's way too many of them. Instead, here they get together within the first three episodes, and then the rest is mostly episodic, showing the natural progression of their relationship through the things that happen around them. I would dock a point for Suna not getting the happy ending he deserves but this show deals with things in such an amazing and mature waythat I really can't give it less than 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: I watched this because it's made by Madhouse, which is one of my favourite studios, therefore I expected it to look good, but not this good. Really, everything about it is beautiful and enhances the atmosphere and feelings conveyed by the show. It takes a bit to get used to the character design, but I've grown to love even that. It's just very colourful and sometimes breathtakingly beautiful, and the backgrounds. Oh god the backgrounds, I love them so much. One day I intend to rewatch this and just stare at the backgrounds in every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: I loved the opening and ending songs, although they never changed, as I had expected from a two-cour show, and the overall ost was perfect for it at all times. The most notable thing, however, was definitely the voice acting. As it introduces quite a few characters in 24 episodes, there are a lot of standout performances within the main cast, but also the side characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: This show is incredible in its treatment of characters. A lot of them are initially presented as typical stereotypes, but then the show goes on and you realize that they're actually very different from what you'd expect. Most importantly, all the significant characters are actually good people. That doesn't mean they don't have flaws, it just means that they all try their best and they always have good intentions and it's really refreshing because even though I love morally grey characters, sometimes I need a show like this to restore my faith in humanity.The best thing about this show, though, is definitely its focus on the relationships between characters. It showcases multiple types of love and friendship, and the most important relationships grow and mature through the course of the anime. This is most obvious with the main couple, who start out as nervous wrecks every time they have to talk to each other, but then as time goes on they start settling down and by the end it feels as if they've been together forever. It's a beautiful thing to witness.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: There were a few parts that dragged, but other than that it made me squeal and laugh and feel really happy all the time, which is what it's meant to do. I might have even teared up a few times, it was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: It probably wouldn't appeal to everyone, but it's perfect for bad days when you just need a pick-me-up. For me, it definitely goes on the list of favourite rom-coms, and I expect that I will be rewatching it quite often in the future.\\n\\n",

The story follow Takeo, a high school freshman, through the story of his first love. Through their ups and downs there's humor and some great life lessons. Props to his best friend Suna for hanging in through all the chaos! Having known a rather large man myself, I could enjoy a lot of the humor that comes from Takeo's size in comparison to his classmates and community. As to be expected, the characters aren't developed a whole lot. But it's not the kind of show where it's reallyneeded. There's not a lot of episodes, so if you're looking for something quick, light hearted, and enjoyable, I recommend this.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!\r\nThis shoujo high school romantic comedy tells the old tale of a teenage boy who falls for a beautiful girl out of his league. Typical shoujo, amirite? \r\nThe only difference is that the main lead is a 2 meter ogre of a man, and his girlfriend is a tiny little chipmunk of a lady. \r\nYeah, not your average shoujo.\r\n[spoiler]Ore Monogatari is, as the title suggests, a simple love story. And yet, it is not. Tropes are bent and twisted all over the place. Gouda Takeo, who looks like a hulking delinquent out of a yakuza manga, is an absolute gentleman. His handsomebest friend, Sunakawa Makoto, who by his appearance looks like the main lead, is a quiet, ultimate bro with little interest in romance. And Yamato Rinko, the female lead, is a severely girly girl who against all odds, falls for Takeo. It takes all but three episodes for them to get together, which honestly, is the best decision this show could have done.\\n\\n\r\nBecause this isn\u2019t about falling in love, per say. It\u2019s about being in love when you\u2019re the biggest odd couple in Japan. This two-cour anime has all the trimmings of a high school romance anime. The dates, the misunderstandings, the beach episode, the rival love interests, and the introspection. And that\u2019s where the anime shines. By being so generic, Gouda and Yamato\u2019s love life is treated as being as normal as any other pairing, even when the in-universe characters think otherwise. And make no mistake, the love between these two is as sincere as can be. \\n\\n\r\nYou won\u2019t find rich drama or betrayal here. For the slight hiccups in Takeo and Yamato\u2019s relationship are always cleanly resolved and always affirms their love. Sunakawa, as mysterious as he is, is treated as a bystander whose own relationship problems are minor hurdles that don\u2019t change him all that much. At times, it may seem repetitive, but the heart is always there. And it\u2019s so pervasive that it starts to feel like a disservice if it were any other way.\\n\\n\r\nMy last note is on the humor. The visual gags are aplenty, and Madhouse does in excellent job at making Takeo\u2019s physicality look wonderfully ludicrous. The aside notes that appear every so often are a bit distracting and superfluous, though carry a certain charm of their own. \\n\\n\r\nOre Monogatari!! is like a slice of chocolate cake in the shape of a donut. It looks and feels off, but it tastes just like the chocolate cake we\u2019ve come to love.[/spoiler]",

            "content": "Those well versed with the romance genre may be familiar with the tropes that these anime tend to regurgitate on a constant basis. Not denying the fact that Ore Monogatari!! doesn't share some of these plot accessories either, the show does attempt to differentiate itself from the rest of the pack. Whether it's been successful at doing so is a whole another story however. \r\nMadhouse veteran when it comes to romance and drama, Asaka Morio, known for his works on anime such as Nana, took charge of the execution unsurprisingly. It was a job well done when it came to maintaining a consistent tone throughoutthe season without any hiccups, most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me on to the next point, the overall nature of the anime; it's light-hearted and funny. The story follows our couple consisting of Yamato and Takeo and the day-to-day activities they encounter. A very common plot trope in this genre. Although there are moments of conflict or love rivals popping up every now and then, this only forms a small portion of the show. What the anime does differently however is to place Takeo (mostly) in situations where less experienced anime watchers may have never seen before. It adds to the comedic value as well as the tension depending on the situation he finds himself in. However, this is also a negative aspect of the show. These scenes seem more suited for a shounen anime than a romance/slice of life, therefore feeling out of place and plain weird when witnessing the events unfolding. \\n\\n\r\nAnother argument is how 'perfect' the couple were. Due to the lack of external dangers towards their relationship, Ore Monogatari was short of substance. It built a solid backbone from which to expand upon, but what you witness in the first few episodes is what you will continue to be fed right until the very last installment. As mentioned before, there are moments of  'drama' but they usually consist of internal problems. This takes shape in the form of misunderstandings and such. \\n\\n\r\nUnsurprisingly the focal point of the anime is on Takeo and Yamato since they are the main duo. But this doesn't excuse the fact that the supporting characters suffered heavily from poor characterization. Side characters walked in and out whenever they felt like doing so, as if it was a 9 am college lecture with half the students turning up late and others falling asleep. Not to mention their introductions felt forced, just for the sake of challenging Yamato/Takeo' love life. \\n\\n\r\nTakeo was a refreshing character, the second coming of Chuck Norris if I may say so. His massive body build and awkward personality led to some hilarious scenes. Yamato however, is far from that. It's like comparing freshly baked bread to faecal matter. She's very generic in every aspect, but the fact that there was no attempt at developing her in some shape or form is truly disappointing. A valid argument is that her character may been there to provide a balance, countering Takeo's over-the-top personality. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also good/consistent, but nothing spectacular. It complimented the anime's tone perfectly. Although some episodes may seem rushed, the fast pacing was vital in order to keep the audience engaged with its episodic nature. If you feel like this is the type of rom-com you're into, feel free to give it a watch.",

            "content": "Story: 8\r\n      This story revolves around a couple that consists of a very small and petite girl and a humongous boy. The girl is the cliche \"perfect and super nice\" type of person, whereas the boy is 2 meters tall and is considered \"unattractive\" to girls. What also makes this anime funny is that both characters are socially awkward and don't really understand a lot of situations, while the boy's best friend is always helping them get over their problems.  Over the course of the anime, many small social and internal conflicts occur to this couple. The pacing isgood, not too fast or too slow. The story is very funny and cute, but also not very developed. There was not a lot of depth and the theme kept repeating itself over and over with each episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\n     The sound was really great! Voice actors had emotion and voice inflection to keep the anime engaging. I had no problem with the opening and ending theme; they fit with the anime really well. I didn't notice much about the background noise, but there wasn't anything unnecessary or unfitting to the situation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\n     The characters were very funny and lovable. However, not many of the characters had any development. The main characters didn't have much development at all, except for the fact that they continued loving each other more and more. There is some development with the main character's best friend, but the development seems cut off, and the audience never really gets to see what he is like. A few of the side characters had changed feelings and whatnot, but the character development could have been a lot deeper.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\n     Apart from the lack of depth in the story and characters, this anime was very funny and enjoyable. The characters had a lot of funny traits, and because the main character's are socially awkward, it is fun to see them try and communicate with other people. Some characters act out randomly and lack common sense. There is also a steady flow of events, and the pacing is not too slow or too fast. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\n     Overall, this anime is definitely worth a try. It is hilarious and well paced, even if there is not enough development. The lack of development doesn't make it bad at all, and the story is very enjoyable. \\n",

            "content": "Ore Monogatari\u2019s synopsis sounds like the most generic romance plotline one could think of. A girl is being molested on a train and a kind guy steps in to save the day, girl proceeds to fall in love with the guy; you get the picture. Ore Monogatari\u2019s twist on this rather generic setting is that the guy is an \u201cunpopular\u201d and \u201cundesirable\u201d kind giant that many find hard to understand. As one who has watched and read their fair share of romance anime/manga, Ore Monogatari\u2019s slightly unique portrayal of a stereotypical shoujo romance was refreshing and entertaining to watch. Rather than the whole \u201cjust gettogether already\u201d that most romances have, instead, we watch as Takeo and Rinko\u2019s relationship develop, how they handle their feelings for each other, their perspectives on dating and love, and how they affect the people around them. \\n\\n\r\nI will start by saying that this show is a victim of many troupes of the shoujo genre, but not in your stereotypical \u201chandsome out of reach guy falls in love with plain and ordinary girl\u201d. The circumstances of Takeo and Rinko\u2019s relationship are fairly different from what I\u2019ve seen before and that alone led to many developments and situations that most romances would not have. We still have the girl who falls hard for an outstanding guy, but outstanding in another sense of the word. After watching shoujo after shoujo, romance after romance, Ore Monogatari gave me a breath of fresh air. Instead of getting frustrated that my ship wasn\u2019t sailing, or the main characters being dishonest with their feelings, or a bunch of rivals getting in the way in an unproductive and unnecessary manner, Ore Monogatari kept that to an absolute minimum. Rather, the focus of the show lies in how much one loves the other, and how that love grows and develops as their relationship progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance, I admit, can be overdone at times. At times it felt like I was being force-fed a spoonful of sugar due to the amount of lovey dovey stuff going on. My eyes sometimes felt like giving out due to the super sparkly aura that the show often times gives out. However, don\u2019t let this dissuade you into not watching the show. There\u2019s enough comedy, tender moments, a pinch of drama here and there, and even some action to try to keep things from getting repetitive and mundane (it does, however, addressed later). A big selling point of the show for me was the relationship between Takeo and Sunakawa. You\u2019ll probably never find a better wingman in your life (so much to the point where it slightly creeps you out that Sunakawa would go so far for Takeo, but well, yeah). He supports and guides the rather na\u00efve Takeo into growing his relationship with Yamato. However, as perfect and intelligent Sunakawa might seem, he too, is a growing high school boy with his share of problems, whether they lie with females and dating, or family issues and personal struggles.\\n\\n\r\nAs they often say, the characters make the show, and for this show, this is particularly true. Takeo is the lovable giant that you can\u2019t miss; whether he\u2019s climbing a tree to rescue a trapped kitten or helping an old lady across the street, his kind and earnest personality shines throughout the series. However, he is incredibly dense, ignorant, and overcaring which does lead to some drama throughout the show. Rinko is the super sweet girl and baking goddess, and also Takeo\u2019s girlfriend. She always tries to give her best, especially when it comes down to supporting Takeo and whatever he does. While she does seem innocent and sweet on the outside, she, like any other girls, get jealous, worry, and has \u201cindecent\u201d thoughts (nothing to see here folks, this show is rated PG-13). Sunakawa is Takeo\u2019s best friend and childhood friend; through thick and thin these two have been together since the beginning. Their personalities are complete opposites, but it\u2019s amazing how opposites can attract. Whether it\u2019s helping Takeo prepare a birthday plan for Yamato, or advising Yamato on what Takeo is probably thinking, he becomes a crucial part in developing the relationship between the two. We also have others who all in some way support their relationship; Sunakawa\u2019s sister Ai who suppresses her own feelings to see the man she loves happy, or Rinko\u2019s group of friends who tag along to group dates and encourage her and give her advice from time to time. It is hard to pick out a character who has not contributed in their relationship in some way.\\n\\n\r\nThe show can be extremely repetitive at times, and there are things that you can see coming from a mile away, aka the show being really predictable. I was particularly annoyed every time Takeo thought to himself \u201cI love her\u201d. The show does drag and stall at times, and sometimes it just seems like you\u2019re watching some baka couple go at it doing standard couple things. I was frustrated in the middle of the season especially after how well things went in the beginning. However, try looking past that and you have a simple story of a man who never had anyone love him for who he is find an incredibly sweet girl who cares for him more than anyone. My recommendation is to simply enjoy Ore Monogatari for what it is; a slightly unconventional shoujo romance that is sweet and refreshing. Don\u2019t try to overwatch or overanalyze it; just laugh when Takeo tries to get Sunakawa to practice kissing with him, or smile as Rinko gets flustered over the small things that Takeo doesn\u2019t notice.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is \u201cpretty\u201d, to sum it up into one word. Everything just seems to shimmer and sparkle. However, there are times that remind you that this is indeed a manga adaptation (such as the times where small text bubbles come out with the inner thoughts of that person). I particularly enjoyed the various facial expressions of all the characters. The animation is what you would expect from an anime of this time very fluid and crisp. Yet, it has hints of cartoonish elements. The music is pretty standard romance show fare; the opening and ending theme are catchy and easy on the ears. The OP is pretty creative and fun to watch, while the ED does a good job wrapping up your feelings in a nice warm box with a bow.\\n\\n\r\nFor both veteran and new romance genre watchers alike, watch Ore Monogatari if you get a chance; you most likely will not regret it. For those of those claiming that it\u2019s repetitive, or it drags, or that it is the same crap over and over again, I will not deny that, it does in fact do all of those things. However, I try to highlight the good points of a show. At the very least, it\u2019ll get you to laugh or say \u201caww\u201d a couple of times!\\n",

For anyone looks for something  a bit different i would defiantly give this a  watch .  The only reason i give the story a 9 is because in my opinion. the ending was not as strong as it could have been and it was played  rather safe . \r\nI fell in love with the art style  and loved the character designs .  Some of the best art i have seen in a long time . \r\nThesounds perfectly matched the atmosphere what was currently going on and would recommend listing to it by itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character  and yamato   played out soo well that it made me  wish i had a relationship like that or feel that it may be possible.  His best  friend however was not used  as much as he could be . This kinda disappointed me \\n\\n\r\nI could barely wait when for the next episode when it came out on crunchy roll  and when it did  i was watching that the moment it came out.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall i gotta give  this anime a 10 because  this was a masterpiece itself.",

I limit it to a score of 7 since one would also be annoyed about the too much giving that one of the BFF does, but it can be forgiven, just not that much. Art (up), well pretty decent anyways, since like I've said that whole anime doesn't rely on the fanservice and eechi to sell, but it still does have the moe in it that was still a quintessential in all animes, I could have commented on Takeo's looks, but then again,it was his looks that makes this anime going. Sound (up) well, I guess I just hate the both opening and closing themes, also Takeo's voice sounded like some 40 something who has been a repeat student for the last 30 years, also Rinko's voice could pass for a 5th grader which was quite annoying, Character (up) well since this anime was all about the BFFs Takeo , Suna and Rinko,I say that the three really does touch us audiences hearts and I'm glad that it has gone that way, also what really did provide the climax was the introduction of Kouki Ichinose who serves as Takeo's competition for Rinko, but what really does gave impact to this category is Takeo himself, I like that his character portrays as a good person in the body of a scary giant and Rinko, who sees him as what he is. Enjoyment (up), I'd say it's good since there were episode that aren't worth watching, but even if one would miss some episodes, one would still enjoy watching the rest cu'z of how this rom-com was done, overall (up) it was very good, and I'm glad studio Madhouse wan't mad enough to add something stupid to this fine anime.\\n\\n\r\nPEACE ESSES!   \\n",

            "content": "The first shoujo anime I ever watched was Sailor Moon. I was around 6 and I would watch the show with my older sister every Saturday morning. I didn\u2019t understand plot elements, the romance, all the jokes, but I do remember having a great time and it being a fond memory. I will admit that since childhood, I have not watched many shoujo anime. In fact I have a tendency to avoid shoujo anime. The esoteric world of shoujo, with it\u2019s soft color pastels, large eyes, bishounen protagonists are all foreign to me. I often find I get bored, busy, or drop the show infavour of a show I find more interesting. However Ore Monogatari has proven to be an exception. Every Wednesday I searched for the subbed episode and found myself watching Ore Monogatari before all other anime. In the shower I would sing the protagonist\u2019s catch phrase, \u201cI love her\u201d in the style of \u201cUptown Funk\u201d by Mark Ronson. I would chat on skype and other formats expressing my love for the show. The show just felt so different, so fresh to many of us. However one day I spoke to an anime fan who has seen a great deal of shoujo, she admitted that she didn\u2019t understand my fascination with the show. She stated that the show may not be as groundbreaking and different that I thought it was. I wrote this review as a way to explore my own opinions and thoughts about this series, I hope it is a benefit both to you and me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I felt this anime was so different was because of the protagonist, Gouda Takeo. In the opening of the show there is a scene of Takeo atop the Empire State Building, an allusion to King Kong. Takeo is similar to King Kong in that he is enormous, his size causes others to fear him and to misunderstand him, but beneath that scary exterior lies a heart of gold. It is only when people get to know Takeo better, do they start to realize how great of a person he is. Going back to the Sailor Moon reference, the male lead Tuxedo Mask is a handsome, mysterious, bishounen type character, everything Takeo is not which I found refreshing. There is a complaint that Takeo is far too simplistic of a character. Some find this annoying, but others like myself find it endearing. No matter how many times Takeo said \u201cI love her,\u201d I never once found it annoying because I felt the character was being genuine to himself.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Takeo the other main leads are Yamato and Suna. Suna is Takeo\u2019s good looking best friend and Yamato is the girl Takeo loves. The three characters have great chemistry with one another. Perhaps some of the best moments are when Suna and Takeo play off one another. The two complement each other so well with Takeo being very blunt and direct while Suna being more reserved and laid back. The anime spent time to show their history in the form of flashbacks. Usually I am not a fan of flashbacks but some of these flashbacks were so funny and cute that they were a joy to watch. The flashbacks also helped to make these characters feel more real and genuine. I would classify Yamato as being a \u201cgirly girl\u201d who is very cute and reminds me of a rabbit with large eyes. As a love interest she would be any person\u2019s ideal. However as a stand alone character she is far less interesting. The only thing I know about her that is not related to Takeo is she is a good at making desserts. With so much time and emphasis being placed on exploring the background of Takeo and Suna, I would have liked to have learned more about the female lead.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThis is where Ore Monogatari falls flat. I have begrudgingly acknowledged that aside from Takeo not being a bishounen lead, Ore Monogatari appears to follow the standard shoujo format I have come to expect. The male leads saves the female lead from being groped on a train, romance ensues. It is always Takeo who saves the day with Yamato or her friends being a damsel in distress. The conflict of whether Takeo gets the girl, gets resolved very early in the series. This is a 24 episode series, after that initial conflict nothing much if anything happens. Instead the show begins to shift focus on secondary characters and simple misunderstandings between the leads. I did enjoy some of these shifts in focus, but in a 24 episode series I would expect more focus to be placed on the leads themselves. Especially when this anime is named \u201cMy Love Story!!\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nI feel the main problem with the leads are that they are too perfect. Takeo may not be the ideal boyfriend but he always does the right thing and Yamato is the perfect girlfriend. This makes the show fairly predictable even in the finale. However in a real relationship people are not always perfect, they fight, they argue. Simple misunderstandings tend to evolve into something more serious. It can be argued that this romance anime is meant to portray young, teenage love and that the two have not reached a sour point in their relationship. That is fine, however the fact remains that this is a 24 episode series, there is opportunity for more than just budding love. \\n\\n\r\nOre Monogatari reminds me of a one shot romance manga. For those unfamiliar, a one shot manga is a manga with only one chapter. I make this comparison because I feel as though Ore Monogatari does not have enough substance to warrant it being a 24 episode series, it could have easily been cut down to 12. Lastly I will say that I strongly identified with Takeo\u2019s struggles of having a low self esteem, thinking you are worthless, placing others ahead of one\u2019s self. It was one of the reasons why I first loved this anime. However this theme is only brought up in the beginning and ending of this anime, this theme is so strong that I wish they would have brought it up more. This and other dark moments of the show are when I felt the most engaged. However the show brushes off many of these moments and never addresses them again. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\\n\r\nThe style very much follows the standard art conventions of shoujo anime. Soft colour palette, characters with large eyes, Suna looking like the typical bishounen character. I would be lying if I said there was anything extraordinary or different when it comes to art and animation. I will say it is all very fitting, the whole point of this artstyle is to give a sense of warmth and feeling of Kawaii, and that is exactly what it gave me. The cutest parts are the inner monologues some characters have, where their thoughts and feelings get physically manifested by cute little drawings. The artstyle is noticeably simplistic, and some scenes feel washed out.  It is almost as though the show is run through one filter when some scenes would do better without it. In regards to the characters designs, Takeo is huge and Yamato is petite. When the two are together their physical characteristics are highlighted. For example when Takeo and Yamato hold hands, her hand looks at though it were a baby\u2019s hand next to his. There was a joke made by one of Yamato\u2019s friends about how they would kiss. When I picture it in my head I can\u2019t help but laugh, I keep picturing Takeo\u2019s enormous lips and I wonder how exactly it would work. My point is, I wonder if the character designs inhibits the anime from being taken very seriously. I get that Takeo is drawn this way to play up the laughs, but perhaps it is a double edged sword. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\\n\r\nI feel as though this is Ore Monogatari\u2019s most overlooked aspect. I would describe the musical score as being subtle and whimsical with a soundtrack that at times can be flat out gorgeous. The group responsible for the musical score and soundtrack is S.E.N.S, the duo also did the music for Kimi Ni Todoke which has a similar feel to this series. However I would say this is a vast improvement mainly due to the added orchestral elements to this soundtrack. Often a track starts with a simple melody on the piano or guitar but then orchestral instruments like the violin, harp and flute fill in the empty spaces. Many tracks like \u201cStory of Mind\u201d, swell to a climax that allows the listener to succumb to a state of euphoria. The issue is that the musical score for this anime mostly uses that first thirty seconds in a track where it is often fairly simplistic. There are tracks like \u201cHurry Up\u201d and \u201cDull\u201d where I had to take off my headphones and make sure I was listening to the right soundtrack. At a certain point songs can get very complex with many underlying tones. I understand that the score has to fit the anime and the producers wanted the show to have a warm simplistic feel, however I do feel bad for S.E.N.S. because it feels as though many of their efforts had gone to waste. There must have been a better way of incorporating this beautiful soundtrack into the score. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a romantic comedy and S.E.N.S were able to make the comedic score not sound juvenile by using Takeo\u2019s physical and mental characteristics. An example of this is the song \u201cEye of the TAKEO\u201d which is an allusion to Eye of the Tiger from Rocky III, however sounds more like Rocky\u2019s theme from the original Rocky film. Takeo is often compared to a gorilla and S.E.N.S play this up by producing tracks like \u201cClumsy\u201d and \u201cHealth First\u201d that sound like they could come from a Donkey Kong video game; they even subtly incorporate 8 bit music to the track. The one aspect I wish the soundtrack and score used more of were jazz tracks which I thought would complement the tone of the show perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was very fitting however I will say that some voices can be polarizing. What can seem very cute and sweet to one person can sound very annoying to another. An example of this is Yamato\u2019s high toned voice that has a very distinct accent. I would like to give a special hand to Takuya Eguchi who is the voice of Takeo as well as Hachiman from Yahari Ore No Seishun Love Comedy. These two characters couldn\u2019t be more different both in voice and characteristics which helps to emphasize Eguchi\u2019s range as a voice actor.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 6/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 (Would be higher if they could have used the soundtrack better)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile Takeo is looked down upon by many females of the show, every male character who meets Takeo loves him. Takeo is manly, great at sports, all the girls don\u2019t fawn over him, honest, loyal and always has your back. Someone you want to be friends with. I think that is why so many guys I have talked to, including me, fell in love with this show. We do not want to see some pretty boy have all the girls fall in love with him and also get the female lead. We relate to Takeo\u2019s struggles of self esteem, not being incredibly handsome and being awkward around girls. That is why I feel that Ore Monogatari is a great introduction to shoujo for many male fans who like me were initially wary of the genre. I have heard of other great shoujo shows and now I want to explore the genre more. I think this show is perfect for couples out there to watch together. I see tons of articles like \u201cChick Flicks Your Boyfriend Will Love\u201d, I feel this would be the anime equivalent of a movie on that list. The show does have it\u2019s faults, flat characters, lack of plot progression, repetitiveness, reliance on tropes, however the characters are so endearing that many of these faults can be overlooked. That being said endearment can be polarizing, if you don\u2019t enjoy this anime 3 episode in I would recommend you to drop it. \\n",

            "content": "This anime has a very realistic storyline. I think that the author of this anime was trying to convey the message that love can be found anywhere. However, as much as I enjoyed the realism of this story, I did not like the characters.\r\nI liked where the author was going with this series, saying that there is hope in finding love for everyone. However, I watch anime to escape the reality of the world and indulge myself in the senseless harem romances, where the perfect guy can get whatever he wants. The male does not have to be perfect at all, at least smart andsensible. In this anime, Takeo had a senseless mind. His mind was always somewhere else or only fixed on one thing. He was a simple minded character that had almost no appeal to the general audience.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first picked up this series and watched the first episode, I thought that the story was good enough for me to continue watching but it quickly got boring as there was no direction to the plot. By this point, I was hoping for Sunakawa would have slowly developed his own kingdom of women or at least gotten a single girlfriend. I continued watching, but to no prevail. He seems very capable and would be a likable main character for the majority of the audience, but his selfless personality over-shone the main character, Takeo, yet still did not get the kind of action that I expected.\\n\\n\r\nAs a note, even the supporting characters had some sort of love blossom throughout the series, but the second main lead did not get anything. I ended up giving up on this series towards the end and began to skip parts and skim through the episodes. Lo and behold!!!... I won't say anything more to prevent spoilers. If you want to watch it for the same reason I watched it, SUFFER AS WELL!! MWA HAHAHAH!!\\n\\n\r\nANYWAYS, overall, this was a good story to follow but it had no direction. If this was a 12 episode series, or even a 6 episode series, I would have been more than satisfied.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nPretty much the whole point of this anime is that size and appearance doesn't matter to a persons heart and in my eyes that is amazing.\r\nThe story centres around Takeo Gouda who is one big, tall and clumsy guy who hasn't had much luck with the ladies whereas his best friend gets all the ladies until one day Takeo meets Rinko Yamato and his luck finally changed for the better.\r\nI really enjoyed the story even though it doesn't have a end goal it is mainly about the relationship between Takeo and Rinko in their everyday lives and I generally thought this was anice and relaxing story to enjoy which it was, it was very enjoyable to watch.\\n\r\nThere was a lot of other sub-plots that did happen along the way which would challenge Takeo's and Rinko's relationship like other people who had crushes on them, stuff that happens with each other's families and even situations that had something to do with their friends or being in dangerous situations like being in a building fire or trapped in the woods it generally felt like a fun adventure with these guys, But the one concern I had with the story is that during the final 4 episodes the feeling I had from the start suddenly started to dip I don't know if it was because of the situations that happened in these episodes or something else, but other than that I really enjoyed the story.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters were really fun to watch seeing the relationship between Takeo and Rinko is probably one of the most adorable things I've seen even though they are completely different size's and height's they fit so well together plus they never really go though any bad stuff that many other anime couples go through for once it just decided to go for the fun and happy route and it was on hell of a ride seeing these characters get past obstacles in their relationship like holding hands, first kiss, supporting each other when either one is doing something that is difficult for them it was very sweet seeing these two go through this stuff.\\n\r\nBut that doesn't mean the other characters don't shine too, Makoto who is Takeo's best friend is probably one of the best, best friend characters that I have seen because even though he is really monotone he generally cares for Takeo and gives him helpful advice with his relationship with Rinko, Makoto's sister was another interesting character because she actually had a crush on Takeo when they were both younger, but of course she had lost her chance and instead of going against Rinko she decides to help them both out while also having to take care one of her own problems and this showed she was a very thoughtful person.\\n\r\nThere was also a sub-plot between Takeo's and Rinko's group of friends and it was also interesting seeing them develop because at first they weren't really interested then over time they slowly grew to like each other so it was fun seeing other characters develop other than Takeo and Rinko.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the artstyle it resembled Your Lie in April which is why I thought this show looked beautiful most of the time and it used speech bubbles like you see in comics or manga's which were used to show the characters inner thought's which felt different and unique for once since I haven't seen another anime do this before or since.\\n\\n\r\nThis was another anime that had food as a big focus of the anime, but it was sweet and funny seeing Takeo's reactions to Rinko's many desserts or sweets that she gave to him over the course of the show, the comedy in this show was golden I hardly stopped laughing it was that good and there is some love triangles introduced at certain points, but I thought these were actually good because it tested the strength of Takeo and Rinko's relationship.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I thought this anime was adorable and very entertaining if you're looking for a sweet and funny Romance for once instead of a tragic one then watch this it'll definitely leave you laughing by the end.",

            "content": "It's a 24-episode series adapted from the shoujo manga of the same name.\r\nJust letting it out there--this isn't the kind of anime that's meant to be thought-provoking, or be set up with a cast of complex and multidimensional characters with multiple plot twist. What we have here is, instead, a simple love story between two nicely fleshed out characters, with just enough introduction of conflicts and interesting minor characters to keep things interesting.\r\nStory is  dead simple--boy meets girl. That's all there is to it. There are trials and tribulations, but it's relatively minor, and there aren't really any gut punches that will keep youreeling like some animes do. Minor plot points involving characters other than main 3 characters are also interesting and do not feel like after thoughts. But again, it's not complex. Story is not--and is not meant to be--engaging.\\n\\n\r\nArt is outstanding, with the style that I am a fan of. You can see some cut corners occasionally, but that's the norm and I wouldn't take any points off because it's not very glaring. Nice use of budget.\\n\\n\r\nBut budget took a hit in terms of sound--OP is literally played everywhere. But I guess that's the norm, too. But variety would've been nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are quite likable, aside from those that obviously shouldn't be. But even unlikable characters seem to have a habit of turning around. This is a feel-good anime and it sticks to its mission. Depth is lacking, and even the deepest, darkest secrets... tend not to be. Closest thing to revelations are probably backstories.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show greatly. I wasn't in the mood for anything heavy and this fit the bill to a T. I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for adult-y cyberpunk-y over the top grimdark anime that we sometimes have a kick for. Watch it when you want to feel warm and fuzzy, with enough humor to keep you laughing, to boot.",

            "content": "Just because someone's friend is a nice person doesn't mean they're nice too. Sometimes, they're friends because the person's nice enough to have them. \r\n-Makoto Sunakawa\r\nWhy is it that things are so important, like feelings, hearts, and souls, are things you can never see?\r\n-Gouda Takeo\r\nStory:\r\nGouda Takeo, a freshfolk in high school really wants a girlfriend. But since Takeo isn't skinny and hot, so none of the girls find him attractive. They're always wanting to fall for his sexy friend, Makoto Sunakawa. One day while Makoto and Takeo are on the train home, Takeo prevents a groper from messing from this girl. Her name is RinkoYamato, and Takeo and Yamato fall in love. <3\\n\r\n    That's mostly it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nTakeo - He was hilarious and just the fun, gigantor the guys in his class loved to hang out with. Although like most dudes, Takeo was dense, but he always put other's feelings in front of his and did things that would hurt him, but made others happy.\\n\\n\r\nMakoto - Seriously, he was my favorite character. Makoto was this really chill dude that's been Takeo's BFF from the start. Even though they're ying and yang, they get along very well. Makoto was the guy that gave Takeo all the dating advice, although he's never tried it out himself.\\n\\n\r\nYamato - She's cute, bubbly, and very clumsy. Yamato was the steriotypical girly-girl-I-care-about-you-lovey-dovey sort of way, and that's good.\\n\\n\r\nAi (Makoto's older sister) - Ai was pretty good too. She was this dramatic but caring college girl that secretly had a crush on Takeo, but eventually helped Yamato with Takeo.\\n\\n\r\nOda - This guy looked like Makoto's twin, but with funky hair. Oda had an obsessive crush on Ai and started to be her tail. Takeo helped him on his love path and Ai was like, \"screw it, let's date.\"\\n\\n\r\nAmami - !Yandare alert! This nerd had a seriously creepy crush on Makoto for 10 years. 10 YEARS SHE WAS STALKING HIM... Finally Amami came out of the corner and asked Makoto out, and I'm not telling you the results.\\n\\n\r\nMaki (Takeo's baby sister) - This kid was mentioned more in the manga when Makoto was all like, \"oh, I'll go away because Takeo doesn't need me anymore\" and stuff. Maki is this overweight adorable baby that Takeo is about in love with (so is Yamato). \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was very good. Some points in the episode when up close, you could see the characters were heavily inked which I loved. The colors fit the characters well, like giving Ichinose darker colors (being hot guy #2) and Makoto lighter colors (being hot guy #1). I liked how they made both the Sunakawas dress similar with bright, but not outgoing, colors.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nAt first, I absolutely HATED the opening. But at the last episodes, I savored the tune starting from the \"My Christmas\" episode because who knows why. The sound effects of people running were very overdone like in most anime. Yamato would run for 3 seconds and she'd act like she'd run a marathon or something by panting dramatically. \\n\\n\r\nI thought Ore Mongatari was hilarious and an anime that lightened up my day. I'd pop it on and laugh along with Makoto and Takeo all day long. I'm not sure if the anime got a lot of likes, but it's a romance, so...??\\n\r\nOne perverted request was that I wish they'd gotten more involved in the love and dating part like some henta- ok, I'll stop there.....\\n\\n\r\nMOVIE:\\n\r\nThey screwed it... They screwed everything!!!! Ai wasn't even mentioned! Neither was the Yandare girl or the pastry guy!!! \\n\r\nI didn't appreciate that more than half that movie was Takeo still thinking that Yamato like Makoto. It was infuriating to not see more of Takeo x Yamato. And the whole fire thing? You'd think it happened at MM Land from the looks of it. And I think it would've been better if they kept that one of the girls was trapped inside the building and such. It wouldn't affect Takeo and Yamato's relationship because you could clearly see that wasn't going anywhere. Also, the scene with Takeo and his father looking at the stars, what happened to Takeo, Yamato, and Makoto doing that?\\n\r\nOne other thing I'll comment on is that they talked SO slowly. Even in the anime they kept up in conversation and didn't have to pause every 2 words.  \\n\r\nI appreciate the fact they didn't make Yamato's voice over-the-top-3-year-old because that got on my nerves (although I got used to it). But god was that ending weird....\\n",

            "content": "Okay, I'm gonna start this review off by telling you that I've never written a review before and that I'm incapable of giving concrete ratings for art, sound, character etc.\r\nThe main reason that I felt like writing a review for this is the fact that I've never before watched a shoujo anime (nor read many shoujo manga). But this should be an exception.\r\nNormally I am, just like many guys, scared off by the label 'shoujo'. Mainly because of the fact that many romance shoujo anime are (in my eyes) all pretty much the same. Now please don't freak out, because this can be said formany, many shounen anime as well. But I personally feel that this anime is different. One of the reasons for this is that the main character of this anime is a guy, which is something that's a must for me. And when I heard that Ore Monogatari had Takeo, a guy, as main character, I immediately started off by reading the manga first. And to be honest, I fell in love with it. After reading the manga I began with the anime. Which, at the time, was already at like 18 episodes. And for the first time in a long time I practically marathoned those 18 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main reasons I loved this is because of the fact that it doesn't feel like a shoujo anime. A male main character, who isn't all pretty and sparkly all shoujo style, but the exact opposite. That drew me to instantly liking Takeo. Even the other guys in the anime (who, mind you, are drawn shoujo style) didn't give me the 'prince on a white horse' generic shoujo character impression. So all in all if someone were to ask me which audience (shounen or shoujo) this anime is watchable for, I would without a doubt say both.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the few things which I personally found a bit too much was the innocence of the love. In certain amounts it's good, but for me this was too much. They hold hands like they're both walking naked on the streets and the first name basis is like doing it for the first time. Which annoyed me a little bit, but not enough to even hesitate to be excited for the next episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, for all the guys asking if this is watchable despite being shoujo: Abso-freaking-lutely.",

            "content": "Many would call this anime predictable and boring, but although it can be those things it also has a lot of heart. I can sense the character's personalities straight away and enjoyed the light that they projected even from a computer screen. I feel that these characters had a lot more life than what is usually seen in anime and I suppose emotionally I became instantly attached. The storyline is a bit slow, but progression is there and it is wonderful to see a girl push for what she wants in an anime. Although shy and a bit odd, Yamato-san is a sweet girl thatis definitely relatable on many levels. Takeo-kun is a dependable and overall honorable guy that you quickly grown to love. Suna is definitely my favorite character from the whole show and definitely the greatest of bros. Overall, although unrealistic in some ways, the show had heart and for that it gets an 8 in my books. Perhaps not the most professional review but the music was nice enough, the animation was good enough and the plot points were sweet. The show didn't break boundaries or form unique situations but it did show a lot of emotion. I think at times in television shows or movies we become so worried about the technical standpoints and whether or not we learned anything. I think what the show proves is that it's okay to sit back and simply enjoy and feel joy. I definitely recommend this anime if you are having a sad day or simply want to watch a cute romance. The show does it pretty well. :)",

            "content": "To put it simply, this anime has exceeded my expectations greatly. It made me laugh and smile (+ I shed a few tears as well). I would have given this a perfect score if not for a few flaws that I will elaborate on later. This is pretty spoiler-free, so read on with ease.\r\nStory\r\nOkay, it's not that original.. but it's still pretty refreshing. Most love stories I've seen in anime are pretty drawn-out and are focused on the chasing part of the relationship (a.k.a the part where they refuse to confess to each other etc) and they get pretty boring after like thousands of episodeswith the MCs still saying dumb stuff like \"I don't love him/her!!!\" ...This is where Ore Monogatari is different. The 'chase' is much shorter in this anime as compared to others and  is more focused on the actual relationship. Some people in the reviews are unhappy about this and claim that the series should have ended right there (which I can understand) and everything afterwards is sooooOooO boring (which I can't as much), but honestly, the relationship between Takeo and Yamato + the friendship between Takeo and Suna are too cute to resist. Of course, the story does get VERY repetitive after a while, so if you're a person who craves for a action-packed storyline, this anime definitely isn't for you. However, I personally enjoyed it as watching them living happy lives (with occasional obstacles) makes me happy as well (cheeesy). :))\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nIt's all really colourful and beautiful. I don't have any complaints. (Plus, the way they portray Takeo's dramatic expressions at times is so funny that I can't help but laugh)\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI love the OP and ED songs; both are very catchy. The seiyuus for the characters were pretty appropriate too, in my opinion. \\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nPretty much the main reason why I love this anime so much is the lovable characters (well, the main characters). Takeo is such a selfless, brave, strong and kind person, Yamato is a sweet, caring and hardworking person and Suna is kind, understanding, gives great advice and is always there for people. Instead of the usual love triangle we see in many love stories, Suna is happy to see both of them together and is not jealous in the slightest (or at least, that is how he is portrayed to be). The friendships and relationships are all very genuine and heartwarming, which is what I value in an anime. With these friendships and relationships, the characters have developed quite a bit as well (mainly Takeo and Yamada). A flaw would be that the side characters did not have that much character development... but then again, the manga is ongoing, so let's hope that there will be some in the future.\\n\r\n____\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching the whole series very much. The comedy, relationships and friendships kept me going :) Feel free to give it a watch if you're into the plot! It will most likely not disappoint. I'd recommend you to drop it if you're not into it by the third episode, though.",

            "content": "There are hundreds of slice of life rom-com anime out there. What stood out about Ore Monogatari is that the story is so light but for some reason it puts you at the edge of your seat because of the anticipation of seeing how relationships would develop over the next episodes. \r\nThe \"gorilla-like\" character has been a staple at mangas and anime in order to create a comic relief or to emphasize how attractive  the main character is by creating a contrast. Ore Monogatari is different. The \"gorilla-like\" character was the main focus of the story which is such a breath of fresh air.His appearance was always being brought up but honestly, I didn't care that he looked so out of place as a main character because I was so hooked at the entire show as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the twist on the regular prince type protagonist, the story was pretty much straight forward. It's about Gouda Takeo's love story and his daily interaction with the people around him. I also ADORED how the anime didn't only focus on the romantic aspect love, half of it was about friendship too. Speaking of friendship, can we all take a moment t appreciate Suna and Takeo's bromance? I was so affected by their friendship, it just felt so sincere (yes, I'm aware, it's an anime). \\n\\n\r\nThe show was filled with endearing characters, all of them have their own quirks which makes them so interesting. In my opinion, Takeo was the one with the most character development, he started as a gentle giant of a push over and ended up being more reliable and confident. Next up was Suna, I thought for sure he would be made into a 1-dimensional uninteresting eye candy but I was wrong. He was still the prince type. Intelligent, cool headed, quiet, perceptive and kind. The fact that Suna, the conventional protagonist type, didn't overshadow Gouda, the \"gorilla-like\" side character type was praise worthy. The one who stayed consistent throughout the show (in a good way) was Yamato, she's the cookie-cutter heroine, kind, cheerful, positive, smart, good at baking but she's not the pure clueless type (in you know what I mean). To sum up her character, she's very relatable. \\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts?! God damn, the hype about this anime is well deserved. It's a feel-good hilarious show. I wish there will be a second season, and I want it to be about Suna. Suna's Love Story to be exact. I think it'd be interesting to watch Suna fumbling around trying to figure out love and relationship. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go look for the manga now. \\n\\n",

Starting out as a love story, Ore Monogatari tells the tales of various characters that appear and how love has an effect on their lives. All of this is seen through the eyes of Takeo Gouda, the Big Show with a kind heart. \r\nStrengths\r\nThe biggest strength of Ore Monogatari!! is the interpersonal relationships between the various characters, particularly Takeo\u2019s relationship with the side cast. After the first 3 episodes that revolve around Takeo meeting Rinko Yamato,his love interest, the series delves into primarily 2 episode stories that detail each side character\u2019s problem and resolution. Each character wants love and, through their journey of finding romance, they develop into a better person after their story arc is complete, some more than others. These stories stem from Takeo\u2019s best friend Makoto Sunakawa facing problems in his family to Takeo\u2019s other classmates tackling their own romantic problems. Each character\u2019s stories are what keep Ore Monogatari entertaining in its 24-episode span, including the one-off episodes centered on the goofball duo of Takeo and Rinko. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation and music is bright, colorful and upbeat. Words can\u2019t describe how good the show looks and sounds. Studio Madhouse did an excellent job adapting this story.\\n\\n\r\nMisstep\\n\r\nPossibly both the best and weakest part about Ore Monogatari!! is Takeo and Rinko. Takeo and Rinko are the least complex characters of the entire cast, and because of that, they are possibly the least interesting characters of their own show. After the initial three episodes, the primary roles for the two, aside from lighthearted, fluffy romance, is helping each side character in their story arcs. In other words, Takeo and Rinko play more of a supportive role. It is unfortunate that the side characters overshadow the main characters. However, it is never tiring to see Takeo and Rinko\u2019s lighthearted romance portrayed on screen. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nOre Monogatari!! is SUPER vanilla, meant to warm the ice cold of hearts. Even though they are the least interesting characters compared to the side cast, Takeo and Rinko are good characters that serve as the audience\u2019s identification figures. The show is lighthearted and straightforward with a touch of character complexities that have possibilities to be delved into further. \\n",

If you've seen pretty much any other rom-com anime, you can imagine how this plays out. Despite this, it's still a very enjoyable experience. \r\nThis series is packed full of quirky humor that perfectly accompanies it's visual art and musical style. More importantly, this is one of the very few romances of any medium that I've seen that doesn't feel disingenuous. While the side characters are often fairly weak, our leads, Takeo and Yamato, have an easily likable chemistry that pops out from the first episode. Samegoes for the relationship Takeo has with Sunakawa, his childhood friend. Also, it is incredibly refreshing to watch an anime without any ecchi fanservice. \\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, it's far from a masterpiece, but if you're looking for a cute, light-hearted, slice-of-life anime that always delivers a satisfying ending, I'd recommend it.",

It takes thestory of two friends that have known eachother since their kindergarden days and puts them in a world full of ramance. It rellates both characters to the japanese nursery story of the red ogre and the blue ogre, one wants to make friends so the other makes a commention to show the people that the first is not a bad guy. I feel they hit very key points everywhere, leaving me utterly astonished by how they ended it so perfectly.\r\nI feel the sound needs tobe hit first since it was just LOVELY. I was blown away by how perfect every voice actor matched their character and their roles. Each voice held its weight to the love and it clearly showed that each actor had a good feel for these roles, making me want to hear them again in the future for whatever anime they might be casted in. Now the bgm, that... that stuff was something else. Honestly, I got so involved in the anime that I completely ignpored the bgm often enough that I didn't actually think there was any but when I started listening to it, I was very impressed. The intro song will forever be ingraved in my mind. It was one of the most catchy, love-feely intro I've heard in a long time and after trying to watch episode 4 without it, the anime didn't feel complete. \\n\\n\r\nShoujo art has a very unique and awe filled art style that emphisises on the love and the emotions in the characters face that you just don't normally get from other animes or art style, or even a lot of real TV. Yes, shoujo art is very one sided, eaither you love it or you hate it. I feel ORe Monogatari did somethere with that that a lot of other animes are trying so hard to do these days; they went right out with its art and pretty much said \"if you like shoujo art, this anime is gonna blow your mind because its gonna have all the art feels you need!\" and completely ignored trying to appaise those that don't like shoujo, which in turn, may not get them as many viewers, but it definatly makes it a show that highly appeases those that like shoujo. The array of colors used for the characters was very nice and it made each character feel alive, while still give that 2-D feel that we all love. Now the one issue I did have with the art, was that it never looked the same twice. Proeportioning issues where everyone between height diffences, which did make me a little confused here and there.\\n\\n\r\nEach character had their own way of working their way into your heart, weither it be through force or by -dereing its way it. Even watching a second character get turned down, and loving the main girl, it just broke me up when anyone got rejected at anytime during this anime. I do wish the characters had more background and had more of a story to tell, but I feel they hit the relationship developments extrordinarily well. The fact that we only get to meat the MC's parents was kidn of a let down to be honest, as I would have loved to see an episode where the hero meets the Heroine's parents.\\n\\n\r\nPlot devolpment in this anime was instintanious. There was no buffer, there was no wait, you knew exactly how the anime was gonna felt from the first episode. Or atleast thats what I thought after seeing. Making this anime actually have a main topic for the MC instead of his struggle TO get that #1 person was a brilliant idea. Showing the soft side of a giant MC is always a great idea and giving the assertive role to the heroine was jaw dropping. Throught the story, I felt that everything progressed astonishingly well and kept me involved and wanting more each minute. \\n\\n\r\nThe feels this anime gave me were on par only with Your Lie In April and even then, I feel it can't even begin to compair to them because Ore Monogatari just had such a strong way to show that it was it's onw style of romance and had too much going for it to be just another shoujo romance. I enjoyed every part of this anime and enjoyed every aspect of the director's ideals for these characters. Overall, its just too good to pass up for anyone. I feel it has to be watched.",

I'd suggest True Tears or Toradora!, but you can look it up yourself. \r\nFor me to say the above, I don't mean that Ore Monogatari istoo cheesy or anything, it is just VERY heart warming.} \\n\\n\r\nNext, I'll explain what you should be expecting from this anime(also considering you like romance):\\n\\n\r\n>A relationship with a constrast between a very cute short girl (Yamato)and a 2 meter tall, very kind hearted guy(Takeo), both first year high-schoolers.\\n\\n\r\n>A very episodic-based series, showing many experiences in the first step into the world of love relationships between these two.\\n\r\n>Many of the stories are honestly real-life relatable, others not a lot, but still very amazing and heart-warming.\\n\\n\r\n>VERY VERY heart-melting reactions (sorry I just can't emphasize this enough) from the characters, that sometimes might even make you think something like: \"Oh God, I know this feeling so well! \" or even simply \"This is actually relatable! \" and lol at the situations \\n\\n\r\n>The classic best friend of the guy in the relationship(Suna), who helps him, and even her, see things from an outsider's perspective to help them solve their problems. This character really really stood out for me because, again, this is very relatable to the real world and makes up for so many satisfying episodes.\\n\\n\r\n>Not a definite storyline, just an episodic and pure slice-of-life anime, constantly showing how the couple is always thinking one abut the other, how they tend to hide some things now and then, just like true human beings.\\n\\n\r\n>Takeo's personality will overwhelm you, and Yamato's as well, since neither of them think twice before sacrificing their well-being for the other's happiness\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you are prepared for a \"\"\"cheesy\"\"\" anime, with absolutely adorable and relatable situations in the world of high school love, then this anime suits you!\\n\r\nIMPORTANT: when i say \"\"\"\"cheesy\"\"\"\" i just mean that the anime is just constantly throwing cutesy and lovely scenes to your face, which some people may consider to be cheesy\\n",

            "content": "OreMonogatari!! (My Story!!) is a light hearted shoujo rom-com that i liked a lot.\r\nFirst, the comedy is very well made. I mean, i laughed a lot at some points... and i'm not the type that laugh a lot... so this could explain itself how i found good the comedy in this anime.\r\nSecond, the romance. Well, it's the classic dream type romance story. Who wouldn't like to have a girlfriend like Yamato? Or a boyfriend like Taeko? I mean, they're pretty unusual, but they're great. I think that everyone would fall for them. \r\nBut, anyways, it's good and enjoyable. \r\nThird, and this part is my andonly my opinion. This anime reminded my life. I'm not strong or tall as Taeko but everytime people look at me like, they think that i'm a bad guy. (And when they begin to talk to me, they smile 'cause i'm nice... i would never understand the human mind.) \\n\r\nSo i felt Taeko stronger, i felt his insecurity, his thoughts. But he's nice, kind and sweet. And first of all, he's sincere with others. \\n\r\nLet's return at the review... so. Ah, alright. I enjoyed this anime a lot. Colourful, full of romance, stories and laughs.\\n\r\nAs with Yamato... well, she's a great girl. And the anime focus on Taeko more than her. Although she's a fantastic girl. Full of sweet and love and cute things. (Classic shoujo main female character).\\n\r\nSide characters are ok. All were fine!\\n\r\nArt and sound were ok too. Shoujo anime tend to be more colourful and this one makes not exception. Sounds too were more... cute and soft.\\n\r\nSo i enjoyed this anime a lot! Full 8 for it!\\n\r\n(I'll spend some few words for Sunakawa: he's great. A golden friend. He's always on Taeko's side and i think he will always be.)\\n",

            "content": "Are you sick and tired of clich\u00e9s and harem shows? Do you want a romance that is actually good, not the repetitive romcom that goes absolutely nowhere and sacrifices everything for the jokes? Then Ore Monogatari is for you. This anime is not perfect, but it's far better than the bulk of cheap romcoms.\r\nThe comedy is surprisingly good, giving a ton of good laughs without pulling the classic black comedy that has to make characters suffer or be humiliated in some way. There is no clich\u00e9d bromatic foil that retarded and has to take the fall just to prove how normal the main character is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there is no harem. Harem is a plague that has infected anime for a long time, and any show that manages to keep it at bay deserves respect. There are beta couples, which is fresh air in the genre that has gotten so stale with main characters that have horribly unattractive personalities but somehow are supreme chick magnets to the point where nobody else seems to be in a relationship because they've monopolized every girl yet still won't act on it. Another reviewer called it \"Nisekoi without the harem\" as if it were a bad thing. I'd say removing the harem is an improvement to most if not all anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for progression, it might not have the timeline of Code Geass, but saying there is no progression is just false. Compared to the classic romcoms that have tainted anime for such a long time, with 20+ episodes of nothing but unresolved sexual tension, I consider a show where somebody gets hitched by the end a major achievement. To a show where they not only hitch the characters before the end, but actually continue with the story, I give my applause. Too many shows refuse to hitch their characters as if afraid the fans would be pissed and try to burn the studio down.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ore Monogatari is definitely part of the 8-9 score category on MAL, not a masterpiece, but definitely something far above average and recommendable to most people. The mix of comedy in romance is far better done that most other romcoms and despite its various flaws it deserves a solid 9, or if you're really critical, at least an 8, but anything less is not doing it justice.\\n",

            "content": "When I review anime, a 7 is a 70% which means the anime was average but nothing special. I noticed most people would say that was worth a 5, or a 50%, but that is an F. If an anime didn't have any obvious flaws other than being nothing special, then I don't think it failed. So please read my reviews with this in mind. This is why most of my ratings seem on the high end. If I enjoyed it enough to finish it, it should be getting a C, not any lower.\r\nOre Monogatari!! was an anime that had caught my eye ever sinceI first saw it released because of its beautiful art style and unique twist on romance. In the end, it really reminded me of Lovely Complex, and that may be one of the reasons I enjoyed it as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nStory(6/10)\\n\r\nAside from the unique concept of a less attractive man falling in love with a cute girl, this was pretty ordinary for a romance. There wasn't too much story, and not much ever really happened. I will say that this doesn't really take too much away from the show, though. In the end it is a romcom anime, so you really shouldn't expect it to have some spectacular story behind it. \\n\\n\r\nArt(8/10)\\n\r\nI believe that this is the strongest point of Ore Monogatari!! When I initially began watching it, I was worried about the characters being drawn with lips, but it works surprisingly well. Overall the soft pastel colors really capture the atmosphere, and the quality of the animation itself is really solid. On top of that, the eyes are really excellent, and just have so much life to them. \\n\\n\r\nSound(6/10)\\n\r\nThis is pretty much my standard as far as sound is concerned. The voice acting was nice, and never noticeably poor for any characters. However, the music wasn't really memorable. The music was never noticeably poor, but it wasn't noticeable excellent either. That is probably the best way to describe it. That intro is really wonderful, though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(7/10)\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the characters, but I was hoping to see a little more development. None of the characters ever seemed to change besides Takeo, who came to understand relationships a little more during the series. I was wishing to see a little bit more work, though. On that note, I can't rate the characters any lower because I just loved them all. I was rooting for each and every one, and enjoyed their presence on screen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(8/10)\\n\r\nThis is really where the anime hits a home run. I couldn't help but smile at how sweet the whole thing was. I was always interested in how the relationship would develop and what twist the next episode would bring. What really helped it along was the comedy, though. The comedy was never dirty or vulgar. It had this innocence to it that accented the show so perfectly. It was all very easy to watch, and a nice way to end the day.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end Ore Monogatari!! really isn't anything revolutionary, but I do think it is something special. The atmosphere is just really sure and the tone is excellent. I can really recommend this to just about anyone that I know. Th only people I would warn away from this is anyone who dislikes romance or a plot that never really goes anywhere. But, why are you even here if that is the case?",

            "content": "Out there, somewhere, there is a guy who is just right for you. For some girls, that guy won't be the most attractive; in fact, some people may compare the guy you love with a gorilla. Even then, you still love that gorilla, and that is never going to change. With that being said, I've been interested in the Ore Monogatari manga since even before the anime was announced, so when the anime was announced, I automatically planned to watch it. All I can say is, watching this anime as it aired had to be one of the best decisions I ever made.\r\nOre Monogatari!! isabout a guy named Takeo Gouda, who is a giant guy - no exaggeration a here, he's HUGE - with a giant heart - no exaggerations here, either. However, the girls don't like him; instead, they want his good-looking best friend, Makoto Sunakawa. One spring day, in his first year of high school, he saves a girl, Rinko Yamato, from being molested by a pervert, and he fell in love with her IMMEDIATELY. However, as Takeo thinks, Yamato, like all of the other girls, likes Sunakawa.\\n\\n\r\n....Or does she?\\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm about to say is probably going to be a spoiler, so if you want to read this review without any spoilers, please skip this paragraph. Okay, so it turns out, Yamato actually loves Takeo, and the two of them, with a little push from Sunakawa, end up being a couple by the end of episode.... 3! Out of 24! Normally, in romance anime, the couple doesn't actually get together until towards the end or even at all. Thus, it's nice to see a romance clich\u00e9 turned around, and we can actually see them as a couple. Takeo himself isn't the kind of protagonist you'd normally see in a romance anime, either, so that's a new one.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in Ore Monogatari is a mix of slice-of-life and drama. Although other people may disagree with me, I liked seeing both parts of the story through and through. I also liked a lot of the characters, and I loved seeing how they grew. Truthfully, though, the three stand-out characters are, of course, the three main characters, Takeo, Yamato, and Sunakawa. As I said before, Takeo isn't the kind of protagonist you'd normally see in a romance anime. I meant that appearance-wise, but maybe I mean that personality-wise, too. Most love interests in shoujo anime are total pricks; Takeo is absolutely not a prick, so it was nice. Takeo also had a lot of moments that just made me crack up laughing. Then, we've got his love interest, Yamato. I must say, Takeo's a lucky guy; Yamato is such a sweet girl, and it's clear that she really cares about her boyfriend.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we've got Sunakawa, Takeo's best friend. At first, it's questionable as to why Takeo and Sunakawa are friends, but as the series goes by, the reason becomes clearer and clearer. Sunakawa truly cares about Takeo, and he's even willing to give up his own happiness for him. That is selflessness at its finest, and I really loved his character. Of course, Sunakawa's hot, too; as a girl, there's no way I can deny THAT.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Ore Monogatari is very colorful and overall quite solid. The character designs were quite good, as well. Truthfully, the voice acting isn't always on-point, but at least Takuya Eguchi didn't completely screw up his voice role as Takeo like I thought he would. The ED, \"Shiawase no Arika\", is quite a nice song, and it's very nice to listen to. However, it cannot compare to the OP, \"Miraikei Answer\", which I just love to DEATH.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ore Monogatari is a massively great anime; in fact, it's a borderline-10/10. If you're tired of most of the clich\u00e9s that most romance anime have, I would definitely recommend this one. I don't exaggerate when I say that this is a love story that all should enjoy!",

            "content": "First time review, so here we go.\r\nOre Monogatari!! has enjoyable things to look for in a romance anime. Want a love story devoid of drama and has so much vanilla, it'd overdose you on sugar? Then this show is for you and your cavities. \r\nEnter Gouda Takeo, the lumbering hulk of a protagonist. Meet also Sunakawa Makoto, the friend/wingman extraordinaire and the primary love interest/casual baker extraordinaire, Yamato Rinko. Despite his huge and intimidating presence, Takeo is a nice guy. The story delves mostly in his interactions with Rinko and how it buds over time, with him obtaining expert advice from Makoto and friends anddoing masculine, muscular, manly stuff that you wouldn't normally see other male protagonists do. It forms a soothing core as the story as he acts nice and friendly to everyone. It's a simple procedure, but I think works well because of one other thing.\\n\\n\r\nThe true core of the anime comes from the art and animation. Madhouse never fails to deliver, but there's something else to it. The quality starts to pop out in really small moments when Takeo and Rinko are together, highlighting them with great timing. It's moments like these where I enjoy the show the most and works well with a story devoid of over-the-top drama. The excitement wore off a bit as the series progressed, but I couldn't stop myself from smiling every episode. It's easy for any show to get a few laughs in... rarely does a show deliver constant enjoyment from beginning to end without any stops in between. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime carries a few gems that other shows don't quite have. If you want a simple romance story and take things easy, this show is definitely for you. \\n",

            "content": "Unlike most love stories that involve 2 characters seeing if they\u2019re meant for each other. This anime takes a different approach, where it explores on the actual relationship of the characters through the dating. But let\u2019s make the 2 lovers very different from one another. \r\n(The video review is up on my channel, here is the written)\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nThe entire premise of the plot is can we get two completely different looking characters and make them a couple. And so comes in Takeo Gouda a very big looking scary guy. But he is quite the softy, he is a really nice guy, and a lotof people just get the wrong idea about him. He just can\u2019t seem to get a girl because of his appearance, in fact most of the girls he falls for, all end up wanting to date his more handsome friend, Makoto Sunkawa, but even his friend has no interest in the girls that fall for him. So Takeo has a history of always failing in finding someone to like him, until he met Rinko Yamato, who he saved from a molester on a train. Now initially Takeo with his mind thinking a girl as good as her cannot fall for him, and mistakenly thinks she has fallen for his friend, he\u2019s goal is to get them together. But let\u2019s scratch that, because after a few episodes in, everything is confessed, and Takeo and Rinko change their relationship status from \u2018single\u2019 to \u2018in a relationship\u2019 with each other.\\n\\n\r\nI love the premise of the story, it\u2019s different to what we are used to seeing. At first it may look rather standard, with just the fact that the characters look completely different to each other. It is not a simple story of can the boy get the girl. It\u2019s a story about their relationship, and how they build their relationship. One big common theme, is being able love someone in the inside. Because it did feel like the relationship came a bit fast, but then it left room for the characters to learn more about their other half. Even though the story is played out very well, through the characters, there are times in the plot where it felt unnecessary or just a distraction. Also there are times where small monologue text pop up on screen, and it\u2019s kind of annoying you have to pause during those times to read them clearly. Some story plots didn\u2019t feel like they made an impact later on. But regardless it is a beautiful story about two lovers learning more about each other. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist is Takeo Gouda, a big scary looking high schooler, who obliviously scares almost everyone he sees. But he is gentle and kind, as he always puts others before him, as he tends to help people all the time without a second thought, never asking anything in return. He is one of the biggest bro\u2019s in anime. Over the course of the anime, Takeo gets a lot of development as he learns, more about himself, because he usually doubts himself just because of his appearance, but he learns how to get along with more people and grows more confidence, in his relationship with Yamato. Albeit is quite dense, so the development takes quite a bit of time.\\n\\n\r\nThe other half of this relationship is Rinko Yamato. She looks cute and innocent, but she is just awkward. She fell for Takeo at first glance after he saved her from a molester, but due to Takeo being quite dense, their relationship started off awkwardly. However after the misunderstanding, she of course becomes his girlfriend. Rinko is the type of person who always feels guilty for not return something in return after being helped, and since Takeo always seems to find a way to help her, she always bakes him cakes afterwards. Her development goes at the same pace as Takeo, as it is about their relationship. However she realises Takeo, is quite dense, and accepts that, because she knows how much the people around him are important to him, so she is very patient with him. But as the story goes on the more development we see from her, and the more she starts showing herself.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main character of the show, that needs some attention for being the best bro, wingman and best third wheeler, is Makoto Sunkawa or also known as Suna. He is a calm, charming, charismatic and kind individual, who rarely shows a lot of emotion, more a kuudere I guess. He like Takeo puts other before him, as he is always looking out for Takeo, as always rejecting the girls that ask him out, because he knows Takeo likes them. He also helps Takeo hook up together with Yamato. He gets small development however, only towards the very end do we see some change, it\u2019s because he is always focused on helping Takeo, hence being the biggest bro and third wheel in anime. \\n\\n\r\nEven though I love all the characters in their own way, it did feel like the characters were always just in the way of Takeo and Yamato. Because they\u2019re time on screen are interesting, but they don\u2019t really add much to the overall plot in general. Its more played out as how does Takeo and Yamato, react to this certain character\u2019s experiences, and unfortunately, even for how interesting some are, they are really never seen again for the rest of the series. However this story is about the relationship between Takeo and Yamato, and I love almost every interaction they have with the other characters, and how the other characters help with their relationship. However, it does feel like every character is sort of nice to them, regardless. There is not much variety in their actions. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 7/10, 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style uses a lot of bright colours and lighting, to really show off the soft sided part of this show. The animation itself is fine, it\u2019s nothing too special. If there is one thing, that is really noticeable with some of the designs, it\u2019s the cake designs that Yamato makes during the show, they look amazing. Now Takeo and Yamato are 2 characters that really stand out, because they look completely different from each other, but they look different from everyone else. To honest, most of the character designs are quite similar. Just because you have one character that looks completely different, doesn\u2019t mean, that every other character should be similar looking to make him feel left out even more. And some of the characters look off. But for the most part the scenery really does a good job of setting the mood.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is rather nice, it does a good job of setting the scene and its really nice to listen to. There are some very cute tracks and some very dramatic tracks which really adds to the majority of the comedy in the anime. The opening song is very nice to, setting up the show. The ending is quite a slow song, that does it job. The voice acting is great too, Takeo and Yamato\u2019s voices are completely different to everyone else and it just shows how much different these characters are. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really loved watching this show, its cute and interesting. It is refreshing to watch a story about the relationship and moving forward rather than the wait to see if two characters can get together. The comedic moments are really entertaining, and are huge benefit to the show. The story is very touching and cute and its cleverly done. All the character interactions were entertaining, because of the majority of the reactions are completely over exaggerated. And no matter you\u2019re always routing for the happy couple to solve their problems and further than relationship, than it already has. Yes there is some distractions along the way, but those distractions are enjoyable to watch as well, because sometimes other characters need some spotlight. Something to keep in mind, is that some of the jokes are re-used quite often.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the story, I give it a 9, because the concept is really unique and they pull it off very well. The story touching and cute, and really well done. It does tend to get distracted here and there. But the plot is really enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound, I give it a 7 and 8. The art suits the themes and the animation is fine as well, not great though. The majority of the characters however just look to similar to each other. The soundtrack does a great job of complimenting each scene and they are nice to listen to. The opening song is really good, the ending could be better buts not too bad.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters I give them a 9. I love the relationship and development between Takeo and Yamato. Every character interactions helps build their relationship and there a lot of interesting characters. I just wished they were shown more after later on during the series, rather than being forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 9. I love watching just about everything in this anime. The character interactions and story was well done. I was just routing for this couple to all the way to build their relationship. There are a lot of cute and funny moments in the anime, even though it gets distracted from time to time, those moments are enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the overall score after rounding it up, I give My Love Story!! A 8.5/10. I recommend this anime to people looking for a good romantic comedy, it\u2019s nice that the story is all about relationship building rather than gaining the confidence to ask each other out.",

            "content": "A romance anime of a new context which is good to watch and has got enjoyable moments too. This is a type of anime where you'll get a knowledge that one should never judge a book by it's cover. When I heard about this anime than at a instant I wanted to watch it but when I watched it; I found it not as good as I expected. Some moments reached to my expectation and some didn't. The first 3-4 episodes are very much interesting than the rest and other 13-14 episodes are good enough to watch but 24 episodes are too much for thisanime. The story line seems to be exaggerated just to show how good the character is.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of this anime is to show that looks is not what matters in love; heart is the thing that needs to be beautiful and pure is love. A bad-ass looking guy named Takeo is not very popular in front of the school girls because any girls wants to make her friends jealous by the looks of her boyfriend. Beyond his looks, Takeo is a good guy from heart. He keeps other people feeling before him and let his feelings go for others happiness. But every girl doesn't want the face of their boyfriend to be sexy and charming, some just look for good heart. In the anime we find some girls who falls for Takeo because he is a good man.\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILER ALERT*\\n\r\nTakeo has a childhood friend named Suwa who is very hot and every girls in the school likes him. In the first we see that Takeo loves a girl but the girl confesses her love to Suwa and Suwa kindly rejects her love. Takeo could not know why Suwa rejected her because he thought that looks is what matters but on the other hand Suwa rejected the girl because he didn't like backstabbers or one who talks bad behind their back. Yamato is  cute girl who was being harassed in the train and Takeo protects her. He falls for her at first glance but he develops a misunderstanding that she loves Suwa for being handsome. On the end of 4th episode Yamato and Takeo becomes one and the rest of the story is to show how good Takeo is from the heart and how bad the world thinks about him.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some funny parts in this anime too. Every time Takeo says \"I Love Her\" is kind of funny and I couldn't hold it and burst out laughing. There are some emotional parts too; when Takeo keeps his feelings back of others just to keep them happy. The story is good and new but overall when you see it than it's got not so good comedy and romantic scenes. So the anime is fair for me.",

At first, when I started it, I, just dropped the show and that was because of the character design of the male lead. I thought that this was way too much. Like the guy was twice the size of the girl making him look like her dad. But I started it again and it was very cute. The progression of the relationship and how the girl never really judged himby his appearance.It may not be the how for hardcore plot or action but with this anime, I just wanted to know more and what would happen with them, problems would arise for the couple and they would fix it. I also loved how the female side characters and the male side characters were not sticking like gum (i hate harem btw) Overall, if your looking for a cute anime with cute characters and a whole lot of cute this anime is for you",

            "content": "Ore Monogatari is an anime that actually starts out better than most shoujo animes I have watched, but also fall flat quicker and flatter than the rest that unfortunately I had to drop it halfway through the anime.\r\nStory: the synopsis of Ore Monogatari describe the anime the best, and it all concluded in the first 3 episodes. Or to put it in another way, it both makes sense and is completely misleading at the same time. There is nothing that's worth calling a plot/story in the anime starting from ep 4. Instead it is a repetitive circle of sugary sweet romance and laughable comedy. Itis not bad, but it makes you feels like eating exactly 1 type of sweet dessert for breakfast, lunch, teatime, dinner and then sneak some into your bed to continue eating on bed. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is great, as expected from a shoujo anime. Our main character Takeo is described as weird looking and somewhat ugly, but the art is still able to make him really likeable. His best friend Suna and girl friend Yamato arts are very good, especially with Suna's hair and Yamato's facial espression. \\n\\n\r\nSound: the sound is good, relaxing and fit a slice of life anime, and the theme songs are also good. I really like the ED. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: the characters are generic with Suna and Takeo swap place for usual anime tropes of MC best friend and love interest. But because the main characters are perfectly good, they dont seems to have development character-wise. That is yet another part that make the anime boring real fast. Their relationship is also wholesome. Suna with the usual MC characteristic should have some development, but unfortunately he isnt MC.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Even though their relationship is really enjoyable, repetitive kills the show real quick. The anime is better if there is only 13 eps\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime deserves a solid 7, even though it is not that bad (below 8 is bad to my scale), I cant give any anime that I had to drop higher score.",

I almost can't even find any bad parts about this anime ;D But it has a really heart-warming story and I loved the fact that they started the romance in the beginning of the anime so you don't need to wait for 2 seasons to see if they end up together or now whichis really rare in romance animes! The only bad thing about this anime that I can think of is that theres only 24 episodes haha :P So if you love cute romance animes you are definitely going to enjoy this one! :)",

            "content": "Coming into this series, I was expecting a generic, decent romance series. I thought that I probably wouldn't enjoy it too much. Then I started watching the series and I was taken in by the really nice animation. I thought that the characters would just be generic but it turned out that they weren't. \r\nTo start off, the main character (Takeo Gouda) is a sort of threatening looking person who is not really liked by girls. People get scared of him due to his size but truly he's a big softy who just wants to help people. \r\nThere's his best friend (Sunakawa) who is prettymuch the opposite of Takeo. All the girls love him and he is shorter and less intimidating. Throughout the series, girls see him as the most beautiful person they have ever seen.\\n\r\nThen, theirs Takeos girlfriend (Yamato Rinko) who is a sweet girl that falls in love with Takeo after he helped her. Throughout the series, Yamato and Takeo get closer and closer together, showing that they love each other. Yamato also makes food for Takeo  to show her appreciation and love towards him. \\n\r\nAll the characters in this series are interesting, all having their own unique quirks which help to present them. Takeo is the overly protective boyfriend who won't let anything bad happen to Yamato. Yamato is a sweet and cute girl who is sometimes awkward when talking with others, especially to do with Takeo. She also likes to bake cakes for Takeo. Sunakawa is the sort of shy, popular character who is the centre of attention to most girls. He also really likes reading and is seen as a pretty boy to the girls, not knowing that he doesn't want to be with anyone.\\n\r\nThe art in the series looks beautiful and fluent, with some small areas that could be improved on. The soundtrack to the series is quite lovely, perfectly capturing the mood of the situation. The characters are likable and the way they act can be quite close to others in real life. The story and setting of the series are nice. The way that the whole love story is dealt with is really well as the people making the series knew what they were doing and learnt from other similar series. \\n\r\nIt is a cute, refreshing series that can keep a good balance of emotion to it. If you haven't watched this series already, go watch it. You won't regret it.\\n\r\nI recommend that anybody who likes to watch nice, romantic series should definitely watch this series.\\n\r\nThis is quite a long review but to be honest, I made this review as short as I could due to the fact that I would have probably, eventually spoiled the series.",

            "content": "In all honesty, reviewer scores are irrelevant. Any anime with an overall rating of more than 8.0 (based on the overall votes) is always worth a watch. \r\nIf you enjoy an innocent, naive and pure rom com view of young love and relationships - you will love Ore Monogatari!!. It is an uplifting tale with occasional touching scenes but it is definitely not a tear jerker by any means. It has great comedy based on the innocence and naivette of it's 2 main characters Takeo Gouda and Rinko Yamato, with the straight man and world's best bro Makoto Sunakawa.\r\nEvery episode is generally filled with sweetnessand light. All 3 main characters are just really nice people. Some complain that they are too one dimensional and that occasionally the jokes wear thin because they play on the innocence of Takeo too much. However in my view - we watch this show for precisely that reason. This anime is classic escapist fare, capturing the beauty and intensity of young love while still touching on themes such as being judged on appearances, unrequited love, dealing with jealousy and building relationships.\\n\\n\r\n*Minor spoiler*\\n\r\nOne point of difference is how the 2 leads form their relationship early in the series, rather than typically dancing around the issue agonisingly for 24 episodes before just holding hands or kissing in the finale. At least in this anime, it establishes this point quickly before moving on. I really appreciated this, having watched things like Kaichou wa Maid sama, ouran host club and teen romantic comedy SNAFU - which basically tortured the audience into submission by the main characters idiocy in not recognising the relationship early. At least in this one, they moved on to explore the actual relationship itself.\\n\\n\r\nArtwise - in general it is colourful with a pleasing palette as you'd expect in a cheerful anime. Above all else, no one can watch this anime and feel depressed because each episode is just so well constructed to end with an uplifting message. \\n\\n\r\nSound - I really enjoyed the soundtrack. Some have complained about the lack of presence of the music but I disagree because I thought the piano pieces which were themes of the 2 leads just fit the mood so well. I loved Clannad and Clannad AS - if you enjoyed Jun Maeda style compositions, you'll enjoy this sound track without question.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - When you watch anime, it helps if you understand what you want out of it. This anime is just a breath of fresh air in that it has no pretensions to explore the tragedy of human relationships nor the darkness that lurks in human hearts. The characters are all nice, there are no enemies, no villains or baddies. There are some awesome comedic scenes and some moments you just want to say 'kawaii!' (the practice kiss is one of the best laugh out loud scenes I've seen in a while!).\\n\\n\r\nOverall - If you are looking for a change of pace in summer 2015 anime, I believe this anime fits the bill. Its a happy, cheerful and inspiring story which while simple does not fail to entertain and touch the heart. The characters are very relatable and you can't help but root and feel for them. This is definitely one of the highlights so far of the summer 2015 season.",

The bromance between Gouda and Suna has real feels on it and the relationship between Yamato and Gouda is just pure and absolutely sweet. I highly recommend this anime if you want to have an ear to ear smile and feels after watching it. I really enjoyed this series and wouldnot even bother to rewatch it again someday.",

            "content": "Ore Monogatari is a 24 episode romantic comedy revolving around the big loveable giant Takeo Goda and his girlfriend Rinko Yamato. It shows there trials and tribulations in being a couple, with some bumps along the way. \r\nStory: \r\nWhen this anime first aired I was surprised at how the less attractive male would take leading role in place of the usual blonde and handsome male in every other shoujo, romantic comedy. Little to my surprise that Takeo would be the one with a heart of gold and a much more likeable personality compared to that of his best friend Makoto Sunakawa. \r\nHowever due to Takeo\u2019sfreakishly large stature for his age he has trouble getting the girl he likes to return his feelings and them often falling for Sunakawa instead. After the process repeats itself for many years it would be safe to assume this would happen again after helping the kind and sweet Rinko Yamato. \\n\\n\r\nMaking the assumption that Rinko likes Sunakawa, Takeo goes about trying to set the two up. Things stay this way before Sunakawa being the good friend he is and clears up the misunderstanding and helps get the two together. \\n\\n\r\nFrom there on out we go through their angst, lack of trust, other love interests for both Takeo and Rinko and other stories.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nTakeo Goda is our main star for the show. He has a large and muscular build despite being a first year at high school. People often mistake him for a criminal as seen in one episode where police approach him. Takeo has a kind personality and helps others who are in need of it without. The downside of his personality is his self-doubt from constant rejection, making the first few episodes of the series quite frustrating. \\n\\n\r\nRinko Yamato is the main love interest and girlfriend of Takeo she is a sweet and nice girl who often likes to bake sweets for Takeo. After being attacked in the first episode Takeo came to her rescue and she developed a crush on him, even going as far as to track him down via police in order to see him again. I get the feeling that there may be more to her character than meets the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nMakoto Sunakawa is Takeo\u2019s best friend. He has the prince charming look and the laid back personality to make girls think he\u2019s cool. Sunakawa is often rejecting girls as they either say bad things about his best friend or has no connection with them whatsoever. Sunakawa was instrumental in getting Takeo and Rinko together and is often good to clear up misunderstanding both have for one another. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe art was really nice in this series; it had a lot of shiny and pretty colours to suit the romantic theme. Madhouse was the studio behind this, meaning of course that we\u2019re unlikely to get a second season. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe opening \u201cMiraikei Answer\u201d was a nice opening it was sweet and the visuals to go with it worked a treat. The ending song \"Shiawase no Arika\" was much better to my taste having a sharp vocals and a lovely guitar sound.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI very much enjoyed this show. When I first saw it I instantly regarded my two best friends as Takeo and Goda as the personalities matched the characters in Ore Monogatari. The story was refreshing, telling it from the view of the less attractive best friend character. The comedy was entertaining and it gives me hope that even I can find love if my heart is good enough. The only flaws I could think of were the shows length, whilst I did enjoy its entirety I did think 24 episodes seemed like a lot. Another is the text that appeared above characters heads when they were thinking something and not saying it aloud, sorry to nit-pick, but I found that distracting. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nOre Monogatari is a lovely show. Being a kind person with a golden personality is more than enough to get the girl of your dreams and this anime portrays that well. Characters are well developed, but leave me feeling there is more to be discovered about the trio of main characters. Story is good, although a bit longer than it needed to be. Art was good and had very pretty colours and nothing wrong with the animation either. There are few flaws in the show to mention. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Ore Monogatari a 7 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have any specific alternate recommendations as this show is similar to most other Romantic comedies out there. \\n",

            "content": "Ore Monogatari is the ultimate feel good romance anime.  It's a break from the standard love triangle/trapezoids, unrequited loves, and shows that either end when the protagonists finally pair up or even end vaguely.  You're not going to see the level of drama common for the genre here.  There are no big plot twists (though plenty of pleasant surprises).  And this is exactly what I think is this story's greatest appeal:  subtlety.  Many of the episodes could be seen as downright mundane.  For example, one episode they go to the zoo.  Exciting, right?\r\nI'll say it clearly, thisshow isn't for everyone.  If you need drama, excitement, and suspense, you'll find it lacking here.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I found this to be something really special, and more often than not I was grinning like a fool from ear-to-ear or laughing out loud.  I just finished watching it a second time a month or so after my first viewing, in English this time (not typical for me but I wanted to recommend it to some friends that don't like subtitles so I checked it out and was VERY pleasantly surprised).  The interaction between Rinko and Takeo is downright sickeningly sweet most of the time.  It's like fanservice for hopeless romantics.  \\n\\n\r\nBut what really brings this show together for me is the characters themselves.  I'm not going to go into too much detail in what makes the individual characters unique, wouldn't do it justice if I tried.  What I will say is that the show itself is much like a relationship with a person.  It's at first taken at face value and perhaps you form opinions or ideas about the characters that are larger than life.  Then you spend more time with those characters, time in which nothing seemingly significant occurs.  But you start to notice things about them.  Like the way Rinko is sensitive to hot food.  Or how Takeo actually scares really easy in theme park horror rides.  Each piece is a tiny part of what makes that character who they are.   And the characters themselves sometimes observe these nuances about one another and appreciate those aspects of them.  That's love right there.  Taking a seemingly arbitrary, mundane aspect of a person and thinking it's cute or endearing simply because it's part of who they are and for no other deeper reason.  You start to see they do get jealous, even though they have a fairy-tale-like relationship.  They get nervous and misunderstand things and even sometimes think that maybe they aren't right for one another.  Maybe someone else that has more in common with the person I love can make them happier than I, who seems totally mismatched, can.  You start to discover that there is always something else to learn about the people in your life, no matter how long you've known them.  One of my favorite lines Takeo says regarding his best friend of over 10 years, \"I know his birthday is on September 13th.  I even know what kind of underwear he wears.  But there is so much I still don't know about him.\"  You come to find that this larger than life guy who seems so strong is just a normal guy at heart, despite all his amazing qualities.\\n\\n\r\nSure there is some introspective discourse about love and friendship and all that.  But that isn't what really makes this show special.  It's a story that's more shown than told, through the mundane day to day relationship of a boy and a girl.  Through the friendship of two polar opposites.  It's the subtlety of it.\\n\\n\r\nNow to some people, a dude is going to save a girl from a groper in the first episode and then pretty much nothing else is going to happen after that.  And they're not wrong to see it that way.  If you don't totally fall in love with this show in the first few episodes, I can pretty much guarantee it's not going to be one of your favorites.  However, I definitely like it enough to recommend anyone who's a sucker for romance give it at least a few episodes.  I just wish there was more of it.",

            "content": "I think it's a sign of a masterpiece anime when there is literally nothing you would change. Unfortunately, there were a few things I would change though I still think this was great. If you want a fresh and original take on the shoujo genre this is definitely a must see. You will laugh hysterically, you would cry passionately and you will leave the series with a warm feeling that everything wrapped up nicely.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThis is a slice of life so not a lot happens. There are some major plot points that happen as substantial events in Takeo's life but most of them are notterribly important. That being said, there are tons of interesting things that happen that make the story progress and the characters develop. The story has a healthy mix of fluff, heartfelt moments, hilarious moments and downright tear jerkers. It managed to cover a broad array of emotions quite well and even though there are a few plot points that droped I highly doubt you'll notice them. The story ends on a high note that wraps everything up cleanly and leaves you feeling satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThis one looks very good. The character designs are unique and the art style is done quite well. There are tons of hilarious still frames of Takeo that will keep me amused for months to come.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThinking about \"Fond memories\" is making me want to cry a little right now. That song always comes in before a strong emotional moment and it never fails to disappoint. Aside from that track the OST was strong and the sound and voice acting was excellent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters truly shine... every single one of them is excellent in their own way. Each of them is given a proper introduction, a fair amount of development and you can relate to all of them. Each of them was likable and there weren't any I really disliked. Granted there were some characters that were not the main focus but they did get enough attention to where you didn't forget about them. Really at the end of the day this is a love story for Yamato and Takeo and the other characters are just there to enhance the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI am truly sad it is over. I wish I hadn't rushed it so much, which is the strongest compliment you can give an anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is strong. If you like slice of life and unconventional romance done VERY well you will love this. I have a hard time thinking anyone would dislike this anime given how funny and interesting it is. If you haven't seen it, see it ASAP. Enjoy!",

The strongest moments for me were the spot-on character interactions and relationships. You could really feel the emotions rolling off the screen. I can't think of any qualms. I suppose the reason i gave it a 9 and not a 10 is due to the genre itself. Can't be helped i suppose. I highly encourage you to watch it, even if Shoujo isn\u2019t your thing (i\u2019m a Shounen girl myself). Overall, I\u2019d say it\u2019s apinnacle of the Shoujo genre.",

            "content": "Honestly, I got more than I expected out of My Love Story. I was originally a bit reluctant to give it a try due to Gouda's design, but watching the trailer and hearing the premise convinced me to give it a shot. Needless to say, I'm glad I did. My Love Story has become one of my favorite Shoujo's, and I'll explain why:\r\nThe characters: Let's start off with Gouda: the big lug is pretty damn lovable and goofy. He's obviously very different than most shoujo romance protagonists, where usually it's a very plain boy with a flexible but weak personality. Gouda's this manly guy whoactually gets along with the majority of his male classmates (who think he's the greatest) in contrast to how normally a male protagonist will have one guy friend who is usually a pervert, where as Gouda's best friend is actually quite the opposite, but we'll get to him next. He's not that smart and while he's confident in his physical capabilities lacks real confidence in himself when it comes to dealing with women, which many can relate to. \\n\r\nOnto his best friend Suna, you could sort of say he's the 'expected' protagonist of the story, with a laid back and almost bland personality and a natural allure that draws women to him. I wasn't sure what to make of him at first and thought he would be boring, but he actually serves the role of best friend perfectly for the story. For one, he loves Gouda (which you'll obviously never hear him say lol) and goes out of his way to help him when he can, knowing that Gouda is pretty dense in the field of romance. People might argue against this, but I love Suna's role. Very few rom-com's, especially in anime, have a best bro role that is taken by someone who is really trying to help the main protagonist. \\n\r\nRinko is a sweetheart. Her initial infatuation with Gouda is as cute as you'd expect from a girl so tiny compared to the hulking Gouda. It's funny, because of his personality, Gouda isn't willing to put his 'selfish' desires of being closer to Rinko at the front to be respectable, so Rinko is the one who has to be 'aggressive' when it comes to this (I put quotations because the things she wants are just small things like holding hands or similar such kiddie stuff lol). Gouda is a nice guy, but he needs to catch a hint lol.\\n\\n\r\nThose are the main characters at least, with a few smaller reoccurring ones that are decent but much less of the focus. I think the three of them make for a great trio in the story that doesn't involve some sort of silly love triangle. This is Gouda's love story, not the story of his fight with his best friend over a girl. \\n\\n\r\nThe tone of My Love Story is generally upbeat and sweet, although some could argue that it's a bit 'too' happy. I was fine with this because I wanted to see the couple succeed, even though I would find it interesting to see what would happen if Gouda were to date one of the other few women who actually like him. \\n\\n\r\nNow that's not to say My Love Story is flawless. Because of the strength in their relationship with one another, it's hard for there to be any true stakes when it comes to the drama. You have a couple times where the couple is faced with an outsider who is attracted to one of the two, but it's easy to tell what choice they will make. If anything, you could almost say that My Love Story is too 'pure', as previously said before. This wasn't a problem for me but I can see why it would be a problem for watchers looking for something with more conflict. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, My Love Story is honestly one of my favorite anime. It might not be a five start for everyone, but if you want a sweet story with a sweet couple, give My Love Story a shot.",

It is different in this anime. She confesses to him soon after their encounter, and this is where the story begins. Now before you go and knit-pick for her confessing only after they've met, some people need to understand that thisis a SHOUJO anime with a simple 24 episodes !!! It is based off of their development as a couple than how they met, but they continue to grow as characters and that is what I find so likable about it. \\n\\n\r\nYou'd also think that there would be misunderstandings, given that the protagonist is telling his love story as the title states - and his best friend is the best looking guy at school. But NO, thank the lord, there are barely any misunderstandings unlike a lot of dramatic romances. Unless you live for that, this anime might not be suitable for you. Each episode kind of represents something new he learns in a relationship AND as a person.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite things about this show is that ALL of the characters have room for development, and his handsome best friend is not just a simple side character. Not many of the characters are there just to fill the space. They were all given screen time and romance was approached in different ways here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It is a cute show with the most precious characters *-* Something that really held it down was their friendship (sorry, not so good with names) - It was simple and fun to watch.",

I will remember this anime for the rest of my life because it showed how to treat girls not just the right way but literally the perfect way. The realism was present throughout the entire show, even in Takeo. There are people that think they are too big or too ugly to get a girl and are contempt with it. Those people are also the most humble, loving, and respectful kind of people. This show breaks the barrier of looking past looks and into what love really is about. Personality, emotions, understanding each other,these have all been covered over and over again to form a beautiful relationship that I'm sure everyone dreams of having. Out of Romance anime this is by far my favorite because it can build the self confidence of some guys that deserve to have this kind of relationship.",

            "content": "Ore Monogatari follows Takeo a very interesting character a very big ogre like boy in high school being so big he scares a lot of people. But in reality he is about as soft as a teddy bear. Everyone who knows him always likes him, unfortunately due to his large size he doesn't really have luck with girls. His best friend Makoto is the total opposite they have been friends since they were kids and they have grew up next door. Makoto is a cool, collected, smart, and handsome young man. So there friendship is a bit odd but none the less they are thebest of friends. It makes Takeo a little upset that every girl he ends up liking always likes Makoto or is saying stuff behind Takeo back. This is until one day on a train ride Takeo sees this girl and this creepy groper feeling her up and he jumps in and saves her. Think girl winds up being Rinko Yamato a beautiful, shy, and very tiny and cute girl. So again the total opposite of Takeo but at the first sight of Takeo she saw the good in him and fell in love with him. At the same time Takeo falls in love with this girl after saving her Takeo is in to very cute girls so she is exactly the type of girl he is looking for. Unfortunately they are both scared and nervous Rinko thinks he is totally awesome totally the coolest and that all the girls must be all over him. And Takeo thinks she must like Makoto from the way she looks at him. But this look is just because she is too embarrassed to look at Takeo. This is until one day Takeo is with Makoto and Rinko is coming over and Takeo hides under the bed and Makoto gets Rinko to admit she has feelings for Takeo and then Takeo pops out and says he has feelings for her too. This is a beautiful love story between two high school kids who are total opposites. I honestly thought this was such a beautiful amazing romance. With two people that are totally different and setting aside there differences and loving each other for who they really are and this honestly blew me away.\\n",

            "content": "I will try to keep this review spoiler free as much as possible but do take care if I slip somewhere that you received this warning at the beginning.  \r\nI saw this anime 3 times until now and it brakes my heart to see this anime ranked so low and get such reviews but I won't judge other people's opinion, as much as I would like to; instead I will just give my own and try to explain to the best of my ability why I think this is a great anime. \r\nStory.....10.\r\n I guess anything cute will cause some people in our daysto gouge their eyes out without considering the packaging. I, on the other hand consider the way it's done and the packaging before dismissing something just because it's overly \"kawai\" in some people's opinion. On this occasion even dough the story is so sweet it can give you diabetes it so well presented and paced in such a way that you will only crave for more. The romance and the bromance in this anime is some of the best I've ever seen, with the red and blue ogres mini story complimenting it perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters.....10\\n\r\nI absolutely love the characters in this anime. Are you looking for realism? Then you can go watch a documentary or shitty dating show on TV. This anime does not boast realism in the way the character handle the relationship but it makes us want to be there, at least that's how I felt. I for one don't watch anime or movies for realism, I face reality everyday outside of those. I watch anime to immerse myself in a better world, to see how would things be if a romance would be this pure and beautiful, or a friendship between two guys can be this hearth-worming. I love the misunderstandings between the characters and they way they clear them. I also like the main character interior monologues.  His voice seems perfect to be the narrator of his own life.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation.....8\\n\r\nWell the animation is not perfect but it's enough for this anime that it shouldn't bother you in the least. I admit I might be biased in this category as I rank animation the lowest when it comes to any entertainment medium. It's the same with games, do we care that much for the graphics to the detriment of the game? Maybe some people do but I think that's a wrong way to see things. And I think many people agree with me seeing the rise of the indie games that don't have the triple a graphics of normal release but is far more enjoyable. The same goes for anime. Just because guilty crown had some very impressive animation, specially for it's time, that doesn't mean the anime wasn't extremely bad in my opinion. I'm not going to say that you can be extremely lazy and don't even bother coloring half the things in your anime (Acchi Kocchi) and call it artist choice you can have fairly good animation for the type of anime you are presenting. That's enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nMusic....8\\n\r\nThe sound is just like the animation nothing to write home about but it's in no way horrible or not in tune with the anime. It does well to compliment the atmosphere of a relaxed conversation in a relaxed world. It just put's you in a chill mood which fits the anime perfectly. The piano score for allot of the adorable situations is so endearing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment....10\\n\r\nYou can tell can't you? You can tell I love this anime. I am the type to re-watch the shows that I like over and over again and seeing how I already saw this 3 times and it's so recent, I just adore this anime. If I ever need my fix of a cute and adorable romance, a wonderful friendship, an anime that makes your worries go away, this is the one for me. Here's hoping I see more of these types of anime. \\n\\n\r\nMy recommendation is to go watch this anime and try to look past your own misconceptions of cute and adorable things are \"meh\" because it'a all in how it's done that makes something great.",

Ore monogatari isa show that not only achieve this points, but excels them, you will laugh a lot with the things they live and love them as a couple.\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler alert!!\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts showing you how Takeo (who is not the average shoujo looking MC guy) always gets ignored for the girls he likes, one day he meets Yamato on a train and save her, and they start to date, I thought that with them becoming a couple in the firsts chapters i will be bored since there was no trill on how they were going  to date, and the show will be tedious,but i never felt the story was boring or anything, i laugh a lot specially with Takeo and suna, Yamato is a loving character so this show will get you hook\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art is above average but doesn't take a huge relevance into the story, the most characteristic thing is the amount of subtitles showing the characters thoughts and ideas, this is a point for them because most of this subs were hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\\n\r\nThe music is cool, makes you feel upbeat but is no masterpiece either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThis is the strongest point of the anime, the characters are pretty well develop, their interactions are fun ass hell, when takeo kisses suna, when Yamato and takeo holds hands,etc XD. Yamato will surprise you, once you get to know how she gets to date takeo :v \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI seriously think this show is a enjoyable one, is awesome, fun, romantic and with good character, i know that not everyone likes shoujo but is you're looking for a good one you might wanna wacht this :p\\n",

            "content": "My Love Story focuses on the relationship developments between the big and intimidating Takeo and the beauty Rinko, whom Takeo saves from a molester aboard a train. Like Kare Kano, My Love Story sticks out from many romance anime in that rather than build up to our main couple eventually confessing to one another and starting up their relationship by late in the show's run, the couple confess and start up their relationship early in the series thus focus is then devoted to exploring the developments in their relationship. The series takes its time in slowly developing our main couple's relationship that include going tothe beach together for the first time, their first kiss, and the first test in commitment to their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it is admirable that My Love Story's premise sticks out quite prominently for a romance title, it does have a major flaw for me in the fact that the individuals making our main relationship don't have much going for them in the way of depth. Takeo is your archetypal imposing male lead in terms of appearance while having a sweeter side, and Rinko is not much better beyond being your beautiful and kind female lead. As there is not much to the couple in regards to personality and depth, this made it hard for me to care much for their relationship developments in spite of its premise sticking out from the norm for your typical romance title. The remaining characters in the series are not better in this regard as many of them also follow archetypes typical of high school themed anime and had little for me to grab my interest for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals to the series stick out prominently with its beautiful scenic shots, bright and vivid color, and well-detailed character and object designs. Food admirers might find themselves foaming from the mouth in seeing the nicely drawn cakes and pastries that are often made by Rinko whenever she meets up with Takeo, adding further to the great presentation of this series.\\n\\n\r\nStill in spite of its visuals and somewhat fresh premise, My Love Story is a tricky series for me to want to recommend. Our main couple doesn't get much in the way of fleshing out and the so-called pureness of their relationship felt a bit saccharine for me at a number of points throughout the show's run. While it is considered one of 2015's top titles by anime fans, your mileage may vary with how well you perceive it.",

            "content": "I believe this anime is for a certain type of character in a person.  The type of character that takes things as they come and is a friendly lad or gal.  The repeated lovely emotions in the anime are amazing because they are consistent.  These emotions are so consistent that at more than one point I had thought to myself that the emotions should differ.  That somebody should get angry or upset.  But then I'd think to myself, does that really have to happen? Can we take these days as being awesome without putting up a fuss about it?I say, yah we can.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I especially loved about Ore Monogatari is the highly expressive emotions coming from all sets of characters.  This anime really gets into the minds of characters and portrays their mindset via actions and/or words.  Most characters are unique and some are placed for comical purposes.  This anime really takes the viewer on an emotional ride.\\n\\n\r\nAnother important aspect about this anime is that the main characters go through troubling times.  Times in-where they have to depend on their friends because they are not strong enough to resolve the situation on their own.  And also, times when they must be stronger than their friends in order to help them through their hardships.  I really enjoyed the special moments in this anime and some days these episodes would end much faster than I expected.  One minute I'd be laughing, and the next I'd see an image of the stars with heartening end-music in the background.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of things were done well here, and I don't see much of a point stating out the flaws in this anime, because honestly they aren't worth mentioning.  Not if its going to steal away the light from the good times.\\n\\n\r\nHere are the ratings:\\n\r\nStory - 9 - What they did right within this anime is to have detailed mini-stories placed within each episode.  Yes this is a slice of life, but the purpose of each story keeps the viewer enthralled and waiting to see how the story ends.\\n\r\nArt - 10 - The graphics are well animated and certain events cause for dynamic and unexpected animations to occur, specifically within the visages of the characters themselves.  All characters are well expressed.\\n\r\nSound - 10 - Very soothing and cheery sound effects & background music.  Also, well placed gloomy songs to hit the feels when the time is right.\\n\r\nCharacters - 10 - By now, it should be a given that the characters are well drawn and well animated.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10 - Well done.  Another 10 for my list.\\n\r\nRecommended - Highly recommended to those looking for a romance anime.",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Ore Monogatari!!. I'm a bit late to this party, but it still seems like it was worth showing up to. I do have some complaints, but overall its a really fun, cute and relaxing show and I do recommend it.\r\nThe story is something that I believe won this show so much fame. Unlike many romance shows, Ore Monogatari has the two characters in a relationship for most of the show. Most of the show after the first four or so episodes is dedicated to small things like building up courage to hold hands, trips to various places,misunderstandings and all the small semi dramatic things you can think of to spice up the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great. It took me so long to try the show because of how Takeo looked in the cover image. However the art style is awesome and even the look of Takeo adds some extra points for the show. The soundtrack was equally as good.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were fun and interesting. Takeo being the big, gorilla like main character adds a lot of comedy and understandable misunderstanding to the show. His best friend Sunakawa seems like hes the cool and popular type, but he plays it completely different. He is more of the intellectual side of Takeo, supporting him from the shadows. Yamato is the love interest, and she is the cutest thing you will ever see. She loves pastries, and Takeo, seems a little dim, and also has normal human interests. \\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of side characters, but many are there for the added lite drama or just to spice up the show and not really worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show a lot. However I now understand why so many Harems, and romance shows hold off on the actual coupling of the characters. Though its frustrating to watch as they dance around one another without progression, its equally frustrating to have nothing to look forward to. In all honesty this show didn't need to be 24 episodes long. 12 episodes would have been enough to cover most of the really good episodes and cut out the frankly boring filler. The characters were interesting but once you got to know them, their antics and humor seemed a bit forced and dry. This didn't ruin the show though, its really fun and a good break from the the crap.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Funny, cute, actually show about a couple. 24 episodes was a bit much, filler episodes can get boring. Recommend to anyone who like romance and good characters.",

Yamoto was adorable and the height difference between her and Takeo was hilarious just as it was cute. There wasn't much to say about the sound, but it was very good and the opening was just too cute! The character development was wonderful, mostly in Suna. You'd thinkthat he is a cold, quite guy. But you see a caring, warm side of him and you find out that is not that perfect nor normal. I found myself laughing for 10 minutes straight at times. I enjoyed this anime and found it quite refreshing. Overall I give it a 10, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to start watching anime.",
