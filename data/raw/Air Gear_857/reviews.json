            "content": "Story: 8/10 Not too bad all things considered.\r\nWhen I started up the first episode of Air Gear I was pretty skeptical. I almost let this one pass by just on the basis that it was based on kids with motorized roller blades. However by the third episode I was completely hooked. I then proceeded to cram 25 episodes in over the span of the night. I must say given the fact that this is based on roller blading I was very impressed with the story presentation, and by the end of the 25th episode I was left begging for a second season. I can onlyhope that the anime gods are working on granting me this wish right now. Along with Berserk that is.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10 Gotta love the fan service.\\n\r\nEverything looks great. Women are well endowed as it should be, and a couple of them don't mind being slutty. Giggity giggity goo. Hell Ikki even busts out some master Roshi style nose bleeds. The scenes where they are racing or battling are truly amazing. It makes you yearn to be in their shoes as they race from rooftop to rooftop flying through the whole city, or how about kicking your worst enemy in the face going about 60 m.p.h? It does suffer from some pauses during the middle of battles, but it isn't enough to deter you as it really helps with character development.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music really helps set the pace of the series, especially during the action sequences. My only problem with it is sometimes it gives away what is about to happen. By that I mean they key it in during the end of a battle or when someone is about to make a big accomplishment. Still it helps to keep you on the edge of your seat waiting in suspense.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, Enjoyment: 10/10 Hand-in-hand.\\n\r\nAn excellent job. The focus on character development is truly what makes the world of Air Treks enjoyable. I'll admit some of the characters are pretty anime cliche, but Air Gear goes a lot further by flushing them out well. Characters are easy to understand, and feel. Almost everyone in the series has their humorous moments whether it's being perverted, clumsy, or just plain sleazy you'll love it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall my main enjoyment came from all the characters. Al though sometimes their actions are enough to make you wince, you'll still fall in love with them all.  \\n",

            "content": "Air Gear is one of those anime shows that you will either love to death or be turned away from it by its weird style.  Its very....how should I put it, \"open,\" in a way like Tenjou Tenje is.  The girls are revealing, the main character, Ikki,  has no shame (as this is shown by him taking a dump in front of EVERYONE while a skating match is going on).  Nevertheless, if you enjoy this kind of humor or can get by it, Air Gear shapes up to be a good introduction anime from its manga counterpart.\r\nThe story is relatively thesame, as with many other sport anime shows.  Ikki wants to be an amazing Air Trek rider (that is what they call themselves) and what he does not know is that the people he lives with are part of the legendary Sleeping Forest Air Trek team.  They try to persuade Ikki from rollerblading because they do not want him to be involved with the drama that comes along with it, but of course, they fail.  Otherwise, this anime would have ended at episode 2.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, each Trek team has the goal of reaching the top of the pyramid, to the A class - to be the best team and trekkers in the world.  And in order for them to do so, they must compete in various kinds of competitions to win the badge of the other team.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is top-notch, clean, smooth and colorful.  They have done a great job and many of the characters and their details.  The women in the show all look gorgeous, to say the least.  \\n\\n\r\nSince its been awhile since I have seen this show, I honestly don't remember how good the music is.  However, as I listen to some of the songs that I have on my computer, I find it being so-so, so I gave it a rating accordingly.  But don't trust me too much on this topic.  Hehe.  ^_^.\\n\\n\r\nAs I have already mentioned, all of the characters are drawn well and have somewhat different personalities.  However, nobody is unique in the sense that you'll be like &quot;Whoa!  I have never seen that in any other anime before.&quot;  As you will find that a lot of the personalties people have can be compared to other characters in other anime shows.  Again, character development is mainly measured by development in their Air Trekking skills.  There really isn't too much of a change in personality in each character to give it much distinction.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you are looking for an intense, action-packed sport, look no further than Air Gear.  The big disappointing thing I have with this show is that the first 25 episodes cover only a very small portion of the manga and I have yet to see any updates in a season 2 of the show.  So I don't know the status of the future of Air Gear at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't read the manga yet, but I heard from many people that it is amazing and a must-read if you have the time.  So once you are introduced to the world of Air Gear with the anime, I would advise to pick up the manga and become even further immersed with the story.",

            "content": "Air Gear is a pretty cool Shounen, Sports, Comedy anime about a teenage boy Itsuki Minami &ldquo;Ikki&rdquo; who ends up thrown into the competitive sport of Air Trek. Being drawn into this extreme sport, Ikki makes it his goal to reach the pinnacle of AT. Although it would have done better without the typical clich&eacute;s, inconsistent plot and countless fan service. ^_^ \r\nAt first glance you might just think of it as rollerblading, with add-ons in the form of an anime but Air Gear manages to pull of a pretty exciting anime with this basic concept. From the beginning something that helps this average-length showis the pace the story and the characters development that will leave you feeling satisfied after each episode. Speaking of the characters, most of their personalities are fairly clich&eacute;d like Ikki who is the sort of male protagonist who&rsquo;s good at heart but doesn&rsquo;t take crap from anyone. Apart from all the rollerblading there&rsquo;s also some action in the series but sometimes it could have done better without. Well of course this can&rsquo;t be a true shounen anime without the action, comedy and fan service.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of animation is a good for the show, with it able to convey the sports, comedy and fan service side of things well. It&rsquo;s only the lack of fluid animation that is a problem and this anime would have been so much better, if only a production studio like &ldquo;Madhouse&rdquo; took it on.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is perfectly incorporated into the show with a variety of hip hop, alternative rock and J-pop. The show&rsquo;s opening theme is what exemplifies the possibility of these types of music complimenting each other.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Air Gear turns out to be a pretty exciting sports anime to watch with the main story easy enough to follow that kids can watch it, but with all the fanservice, its not advised. Even though the story develops well enough, there is a lot of stuff that is randomly added in which further complicates this anime (like Regalia and Genesis). In the end this is an anime that deserves a second series and hopefully by then the animation quality would be better. \\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "All things given, this is my first review. Please don't hit on me too hard for what I say as I'm inexperienced when it comes to writing reviews. I'll get better as I write more.\r\nI'm gonna start things off with saying how I watched the dubbed version of this. Though I can't imagine it mattering much when it comes to this show, it'd be helpful knowledge regardless. Air gear.. was a bit disappointing. The show had great potential and yet was executed poorly. \r\nStory 5/10\r\nAir Gear's story was bland. One kid finds these things called ATs, loves them, and apparently is the destined king orsomething. He comes naturally good at them. This kind of story has been retold in probably many anime; Air Gear just doesn't tell it as well as some others do. It's predictable, poorly paced where it feels there are filler episodes at strange places, and even the end was abrupt and boring.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the show is pretty darn good. The style represented the dark feel of the show when needed but had a light undertone when things were bright and cheery. Character designs were nice and very different from one another. Even if you couldn't remember the names of characters, each character looked so different that it would be impossible to mix them up. Props for that. The animation was pretty good too when it wasn't trying to intentionally be cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI'd be a liar if I said that the music of this show didn't pump me up when it needed to. It knew when to play sad, happy, intense, or whatever atmosphere you needed at the time. They reuse the same theme quite a bit, but it never seemed to get tiring.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry but.. Tom-Tom.. Why was she a character? Rant aside, some characters were written pretty well while others just flopped. The main character was in between as he often did things that would seem just over the top, even for him. Some characters revolved around being pervs. Others improved themselves as the show went on. My favorite character however had a neat perk that's been done before in different ways. If people remember Lunch/Launch from Dragon Ball, it's sort of like that. The big difference being the character's split personality was triggered by an eye patch covering the other persona's eye and that said persona's were aware of the others existence and knew some of the things the other did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI've watch anime that has me hooked with formulas like these and Air Gear failed to do that. It felt like a chore to watch with all the fan service it throws at you. It's enough to make someone sick. Not only that though, the story's blandness and the predictability the show has doesn't compliment the art or the sound well. The show also seems to forget a sub-plot they were trying to form near the end. The fact that the end is abrupt makes you assume there'd be a sequel of some kind, bringing that sub-plot back but nope. That was it. I'd stay away from this show.",

            "content": "EDIT: This review has been edited since finishing the series.\r\nThis is my first review so here goes nothing.\r\nI can\u2019t actually remember why I started watching Air Gear, but that\u2019s beside the point. The plot intrigued me and I gave it a go. I thought that I would perhaps like it, but I was completely wrong. I detested this show.\r\nThe story itself isn\u2019t all that bad, but it is a bit clich\u00e9d. A kid gets hooked on the latest sport fad (Air Treks or ATs for short) and wants to become the best at it. So he forms a team with his friends to try andmake it to the top. It seems like it could work out really well, but let me tell you, at seventeen episodes in, absolutely nothing happens. Sure, they battle a few other teams and get somewhat better, but nothing drastic has happens otherwise. Maybe it\u2019s just the way they paced the show, but that's all it is until episode twenty-six and it thoroughly dissapoints. The show ends rather ubruptly as well, and it leaves the viewer asking far too many questions. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems to me that the animation company had doubts on how well the show would do, so every two seconds they decided to throw in: a) a naked girl b) a guy fantasizing about a naked girl c) a guy looking up a girl\u2019s skirt d) a guy attempting to grope a girl or e) all of the above. Now, I don\u2019t mind the fan service every so often (what\u2019s a shonen series without it?), but this show pushed the limits and put it in for no reason whatsoever. It\u2019s almost like it was an ecchi show with sports, not a sports show with some ecchi thrown in.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and art in this show aren\u2019t all that special, but I\u2019ve become somewhat fond of the opening and ending. I\u2019m all for the stupid chibi (could they even be called that? They looked more demented than cute) versions they make of the characters every so often, but I wasn\u2019t too thrilled with it overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe only aspect of this show that I really enjoyed was the back story between Rika and Sora. It was extremely touching, and I wouldn\u2019t have minded if the show was only about them. I honestly hated the other character and found them to be mainly anime stereotypes, Mary-Sues and Gary-Stus if you will. I think the series would have been so much more enjoyable if the characters were more interesting and more original. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want a great show with an interesting plot and great characters, turn around and look somewhere else. If you\u2019re looking for boobs every other minute, be my guest and plow through all twenty-six episodes of this disaster. \\n\\n\r\nThe breakdown:\\n\r\nAnimation: 7\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nPlot/Story: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nAir Gear had the potential to be amazing, but it isn\u2019t. But I guess that\u2019s expected when the creator has a penname like \u201cOh! Great.\u201d\\n",

            "content": "Air Gear is definitely an interesting series to review. I'm a rare breed -- a person who watched the anime before reading the manga, and thus, I think I have a fresh perspective on the story. I'm not comparing it to the manga as many fans do with anime adaptations. \"OMG! They left out my favorite scene with the spatula!!11oneone This anime suxxr0rs!\" is an exaggeration of a complaint voiced by fans of a certain series: the adaptation isn't true to the original work, therefore, it isn't as good as the original work. I, however, had nothing to compare this anime to, so I believemy review will be free of &quot;fan-bias&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nSo what did I think of this series watching it from a fresh-faced, new-minded, open-hearted attitude?\\n\\n\r\nAir Gear is an interesting piece. The premise is about motorized roller-blades (Air Treks) that allow you to skate fast and even fly in the air. (Awesome, right?) The premise sounds like a fabulous set-up for a futuristic shonen sports anime. However, this description doesn't accurately describe what Air Gear is all about.\\n\\n\r\nThe series follows Itsuki (Ikki) Minami, the leader of a small Junior High gang made up of his two best friends, Kazu and Onigiri. Ikki gets into loads of fights and is pretty much a deliquent. But when he gets thoroughly beat down by a group of a team of Storm Riders (those who ride Air Treks) he wants revenge, and he wants to do it their way.\\n\\n\r\nIkki gets a hold of a pair of Air Treks from the Noyamono sisters, a group of four (sexy) girls who have looked after Ikki since he was a small child. Rika, the oldest, is level-headed and maternal, but can lose her temper at times. Mikan, High school aged, is short-tempered and tomboyish. Ringo, who is Ikki's age and has quite a crush on him, is smart, sweet, and talented. And Ume, the littlest, is a bit creepy at times, but mostly cute. Little does Ikki know that these four used to make up Sleeping Forest, a top-ranked Air Trek team with serious street cred.\\n\\n\r\nHe learns to ride Air Treks and it becomes clear from early on that Ikki has talent. A prodigy, some might say. After various Air Trek adventures, he forms his own team, Kogarasumaru, made up of himself, Kazu, Onigiri, a former rival named Buccha, and a little psychotic Storm Rider with MPD, Akito/Agito.\\n\\n\r\nThe story chronicles Ikki's journey with Kogarasumaru, but it focuses more on Ikki has an individual. I wouldn't call this a &quot;sports anime&quot; by any means -- it's far too dramatic for that. Now, while I know sports anime can get pretty serious at times, this &quot;sport&quot; ended up being so dramatic, it came to life and death. Storm Riders do not compete for fun -- they compete to survive, to rise up, and to become the best.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the biggest question I have for this series:\\n\\n\r\nWhy?\\n\\n\r\nTo me, Air Treks sound like a bunch of fun. You get to skate around and fly in the sky and be awesome overall. So why in the world has this been reduced to such serious business? There's a whole hierarchy of Storm Riders, and super parts called &quot;Regalias&quot; that only Kings can possess. Oh, and if you want to be the Sky King, you have to defeat everyone else in a big Tower Tournament thing (it was explained rather poorly. Considering the anime never even got to the Tower, I didn't pay it much mind.) Throughout the whole series, I was stopping and saying, &quot;Wait a minute...this is supposed to be fun, right?&quot;\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to say this right now. Air Gear had the potential to be fun. But it isn't. It's funny at times, but it's never fun. I never get that sense of frivolity and joy watching it that I get when I watch other sports anime. I'm never saying &quot;Go Kogarasumaru!&quot; because I'm too busy saying, &quot;HOLY SHIT KOGARASUMARU YOU'RE ALL GONNA DIE!&quot;. Seriously, some Air Trek battles are nothing but street brawls on roller blades. How boring is that? The biggest team fight of the series is nothing but a big violent fight on Air Treks, and I think, &quot;The hell? Take off the skates and just hit each other.&quot;\\n\\n\r\nNow there have been pretty crazy premises in some anime. Far more crazy than this. I think the reason I don't buy this whole &quot;I'm going to use this super fun piece of technology to beat people up so I can be the best&quot; is because there is never adequate reason given. Why do they want to be the best? For the sake of being the best. Okay, so...why? To me, it makes no sense. They try to explain it with some mumbo jumbo about wanting to &quot;grab the sky&quot; or &quot;fly as high as you can&quot;, but it all reads very forced instead of endearing or captivating.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the &quot;grab the sky&quot; stuff, there is FAR too much time wasted in this series pontificating at length about how Ikki is going &quot;to be the one to grasp the sky in his fists&quot; or some Japanese random inspirational dialogue. If I heard one more person talk about Ikki flying in the sky, I was going to scream. &quot;I get it!&quot; I wanted to yell, &quot;FLYING IS A METAPHOR FOR FREEDOM! Ikki flies without worry! I get it! You can stop it now!&quot; The pontificating of Ikki also got on my nerves. One more revelation about Air Treks and how they've built his character, and I was ready to just vomit.\\n\\n\r\nNow, all this makes it seem like I didn't enjoy the series. I'm not going to lie. Air Gear is by no means fabulous. It's not a gem of anime by any means. At times, it's downright boring. But when it comes to this over-the-top, far too heavy tale, the characters become the saving grace.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Air Gear are very real. I can imagine knowing them. Despite Ikki's annoying monologues, he's an endearing hero, and you actually want to see him succeed. His friends are great, although I wish they would've been explored a bit more. Ringo, who is explored very much, is by far my favorite character in the series. She has so many levels, she isn't just the &quot;cute anime girl with the crush on the hero&quot; by any means. She kicks more ass than Ikki on Air Treks, she's sweet without being a pushover, and she's flawed. She's overbearing and tries to hard to protect the ones she loves, which is such a human quality. Akito/Agito are also great. Both are very distinct, although I wish Akito would have gotten more screen time. We spent too much time on the rough and harsh Agito in my opinion. I can tell why most Air Gear cosplayers cosplay Akito/Agito. He's very lovable.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great thing about this show is the animation. It's detailed and clean, and the Air Trek battles are animated with style. I love effort being put into the art of an anime, and this one definitely shows effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also FABULOUS. BEST music I have heard in an anime in a long, long, time. I found myself bopping to some of the tracks. The OST of this series is definitely on my wishlist (or my torrent list, lol.)\\n\\n\r\nWhat this series, and all of Oh-Great's mangas, is full of is gratutious fan-service. That's right, busty babes wearing pretty much nothing, showing off what their momma gave them every chapter. People have complimented &quot;Oh-Great!&quot; on his &quot;fabulous females&quot;. I assume they mean the art, because besides Ringo and Simca, every female in this series is nothing but a pair of walking, talking tits and ass. I don't blame Oh-Great! He knows what the readers like, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nAir Gear has been heavily criticized for its ending. It just kinda...ends...in the middle of the manga. There were only 25 episodes produced, and thus, the series ended rather strangely, with plenty of plot holes. Still, I thought the ending was handled very well. It was an ending that brought closure (not much, but enough) and gave me that &quot;okay, now it's over&quot; feeling. I think, however, it would have been in their best interest to have continued the anime. Maybe the ratings just weren't supporting it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think Air Gear is a great idea executed mediocrely. The series is too dark, too heavy, with no adequate explanation for its tone beyond some random flying and wings metaphors. Still, it has some good things to offer: great characters, fun animation, awesome music, and the opportunity to fantasize about flying roller-blades.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I've decided that I'm going to give the manga a try and see if it's any better than the anime. I've heard great things, so why not? I'll just catch up gradually I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10",

            "content": "I think I have a newfound respect for anybody that enjoys this show. Not because it's a bad show, but because it's a bad show that somehow gathers a respectable amount of fans. Air Gear is bad. It's not just bad, it's probably the worst show I've ever seen.\r\nHave you ever seen a review with big bold caps streaming the headline blatantly screaming to you \"WORST SHOW EVER\"? Everybody that writes a bad review often tells it that way, but it means there are about a hundred other \"WORST SHOWS EVER\". I admit to watching plenty of shows within the span of my daily life,and it takes me a while to rethink a show and decide whether or not I like it. Some for better, some for worse, but the truth is, I've never seen an anime show that I've truly regret watching, not even those I would want to watch again. Air Gear is radically different.\\n\\n\r\nStory: I rated the story 7/10. This is well-deserved and dignified, because let's face it, how often do you see an anime show about rollerblades? In Air Gear's defense, it may be the only one of its kind. The issue I had with the story is the really quick pickup towards the last couple episodes, where suddenly the plot dove full-throttle into a wall, as if this was a show wishing for itself to end. What can I say to that, aside from calm down and flow a little more naturally? Nothing much, especially when the first couple of episodes emphasized falling over and over again. It was nice to see him falling without the slightest clue as to what he was doing the first times, but how about an episode where he DOESN'T fall from something every so often? You're not a factory, so please stop your blatant repetition.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation is world-class, similar to how you would say Shingeki no Kyojin has some of the best art direction in an anime show, but for the first couple of episodes, I had to readjust my preferences until the art style sank in, unlike Shingeki no Kyojin which doesn't borrow elements from the \"common\" anime yet still managed to draw me in the moment it began (without regards to what was actually happening). The look as a whole did remind me of Samurai Champloo, especially with the presence of Minami Itsuki who vaguely resembled Mugen, and given the setting in a modern-day urban environment, I was pretty much sold. It looks good and the story is nice, that should give me an incentive to stick around.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Another anime with a badass soundtrack, a sick opening theme, and better sprites and sound effects than can be produced with a Korg synthesizer (of course I'm exaggerating), the music is something to behold for sure. If I could say so myself, Air Gear has one of the best soundtracks out there, behind a musical, in which music is the main focus. Based on Story, Art, and Sound, I was almost convinced that I would be watching another masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nALMOST convinced.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I was thoroughly disappointed with the characters. Minami Itsuki lives in a world where he happens to be the main protagonist of a sports show, so what's up with this guy? He has no shame and even used the \"public restroom\" during one of the battles, and just like all the other guys in this show, they're ALL perverts. That brings me to the case of Noyamano Ringo, a girl that Itsuki lives with. She must have some insane type of unrequited love, especially to fall in love with a guy like Itsuki. In fact, what about Simca, who is supposedly \"in love\" with Itsuki? She obviously takes kindly to being the whore of the AT world, especially when it becomes a hobby to show up nude in front of a guy that you didn't like at the very beginning.These characters have a lack of common sense, and unlike a comedy that recognizes stupid characters, Air Gear simply allows them to happen, and to this day, I believe they're dead serious about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: What's the genre for Air Gear, sports? I also believe that they've thrown in a couple of other genres in there, like Comedy, Action, Romance, all the typical anime genres. That's the thing I found strange about Air Gear. Its genre is so confused, if Air Gear were human and you ran a sexuality test on it, the reading would come out as \"inconclusive\". Air Gear FAILS to recognize its own genre, and instead of giving it the right amount of comedy, action, and romance, Air Gear throws all of them into a blender, minces it, and hopes it tastes good. By this time, the formula is bitter, and you can't even taste what it was supposed to be to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nAnd Air Gear doesn't stop at trying to mix the genres above. It also adds more to a formula that it can't get correctly. Instead of identifying what it's supposed to be and allowing them to exist without twisting them into a quite unpleasant experience, it's also trying to tell you, \"oh yeah, did we mention we're also an Ecchi?\" If you did not understand any bit of my analogy, this is what it means: Air Gear tries to blend Comedy, Action, and Romance, and also tries to get by on adding an ecchi scene \"here and there\". It's the reverse order, in reality. Air Gear is an Ecchi show before anything. THEN it gets to be a Romantic Action Comedy that doesn't happen to be funny, nor romantic, and it just happens to have action in it. Air Gear's genre is so confused that it allows serious events to be complemented with a terrible sense of humor, comedy that's hardly impressive and so lackluster that you could watch with a straight face.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The art is appealing, the sound is studded with quality, and the story is decent minus that enormous quirk at the very end, but the characters are hardly notable and trying to find the non-Ecchi parts of Air Gear is like searching for a needle in a haystack: you need to be searching actively to find those parts.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong. The show has its incredible moments. High-velocity action sequences, a badass soundtrack, and some of the best art direction to ever be found in an anime show, but take it down to the other elements and there's no redeeming qualities in the fields of characters, enjoyment, and content. There's simply nothing about those three categories that could pick this show up off its feet and allow it to compete with even the most generic of shows.\\n\\n\r\nAir Gear seriously has the potential to be something amazing, taking something generally \"uncool\" and giving it a reboot into something much easier to appreciate, but the very fact that it can't mix genres well and can't even identify what it is to begin with leaves it much to be desired. I know it has the potential to be amazing, but it can't be unless it throws out the Ecchi, the horrid Comedy, the forgettable characters, and learns to blend its own elements correctly.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I've just come to the realization that I described the entire show. I guess there's simply no way I will ever like this show.",

            "content": "Just when you think there are already too many battle shounens out there, here comes another. However, I appreciate the fact that Air Gear at least comes with a unique concept. Regardless, a battle shounen is a battle shounen and it all comes down to presentation that decides whether or not an anime stands out in its genre. Unfortunately, that isn't quite the case for Air Gear. It is definitely enjoyable but it doesn't present anything new to the table. If you plan to watch this anime expecting a masterpiece, prepare to be disappointed; but if you just come in for a good time, thenhelp yourself.\\n\\n\r\nStory (25%) - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe plot starts out the same as any battle shounen; there's a special sport/power with a special tournament which has special people participating. The MC suddenly gets exposed to it, wants to join, forms a team, etc. This seems generic but would have actually been fine considering that the characters and city setting seem suited for this kind of plot. However, the writer suddenly got ambitious and decided to insert some epic, grand plot to keep everyone tuned in. From there, the plot becomes a mess as it keeps us begging for answers but obviously there isn't enough time to answer half of them in a 25 episode show. It would have been nice to know at least just how they seem to gain superpowers from using mechanized roller blades, but we don't even get that. All in all though, nothing gets too dragged out and the story is at least internally coherent and simple albeit incomplete as it only covers about 1/3 of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt (20%) - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds and character designs are simply breathtaking. There isn't a single frame which looks ugly and the characters are well-proportioned. Animation is fluid, which really does wonders for an action anime such as this. The way in which the city's atmosphere blends magically with the more surreal fantasy, supernatural-ish dream world thingy is also superb. If only they did a better job at explaining that world, the transition might have been flawless. There are a few things the art does kinda bad, but these are few and usually occur with minor details of supporting characters, so they can easily be ignored.\\n\\n\r\nSound (20%) - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the anime truly shines. I swear to the god I don't believe in that the soundtrack is one of the best in anime. Considering that the opening song basically started the career of its creators, you know you can expect something good. More than half the songs in its soundtrack can be listened to on their own and every song fits its scene nicely. The atmosphere is not only preserved by the sound, it is greatly enhanced by it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (25%) - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely the anime's weakest point. The characters don't have much variation with other shounen archetypes. The only ones remotely interesting are Agito and Ringo. And even they aren't that different in the shounen genre. However, I think they make up for their individual blandness by their good chemistry with each other. Although even this gets ruined by the excessive fanservice the show shoves in your face. Nonetheless, the characters are likable (for the most part) and they move the story along well enough. Don't expect them to be serious though as basically every character is a comic relief character at some point, usually accompanied by fanservice. There also isn't much development among its characters. Only Ikki and Kazu get some degree of development and even that is rather superficial. But considering this is shounen, it's at least something.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10%) - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is popcorn material no question. It may suddenly give you some deep-sounding quote out of nowhere for no reason but you'd have to be a fool to take it seriously, especially considering the tits and ass shots outnumber those quotes 2 to 1. If you expect some action and comedy, you'll be pleasantly surprised when the anime gives you exactly that plus the great art and sound. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt may have a great soundtrack and visuals but no story and characters to remember it by. It is entertaining but I seriously doubt that it will leave an impact on anyone. Still, it is worth your time if for the visuals and sound alone.",

            "content": "Roller blades are cool, but motorized roller blades are waaaay much too cooler. This brings us to Air Gear.  Air Gear is a show which obviously originated from roller blades. You either like the show or get annoyed at it for breaking the laws of physics (which most of the series out there do. dude, its anime). \r\nSince I\u2019ve just recently watched Air Gear, I have no idea what the manga version is. So to be precise, I\u2019ll be doing this review for the animation only.\r\nStory: 7\r\nAir Gear\u2019s story isn\u2019t that different from the other shounen shows out there. We all got to admitthat shounen shows are jam-packed with clich\u00e9 events. But that\u2019s one of the many charms of the genre. As I was saying, Air Gear\u2019s a generic shounen series. Minami Itsuki, or simply called as Ikki, is our protagonist. A hot-headed kid who got his assed kicked by a street gang member of the Storm Riders. Upon heading home he discovers a not-so-secret locked room in their house containing a pair of Air Treks, motorized roller blades. He wore the ATs and rode it for the first time in his life. Days after learning how to ride Air Treks, Ikki plans to build his own Storm Riders Gang. As he progresses deeper and deeper to the art of Air Trek, problems arise from left and right. To be able to reach the top, he and his gang needs to widen their territory and improve their rank to challenge stronger riders.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nIf you consider a show almost 9 years ago a classic (who am I kidding? 9 years is pretty damn long), then Air Gear\u2019s art is pretty good. Air Gear\u2019s arts differ in what\u2019s happening currently in the show. For example: the background changes when they ride (AT riding, I mean) the art becomes CG enhanced; you know those cars in Initial D? Yes, they have those, too. There are different drawings for the characters, too. Like when Ikki makes a funny face which really differs from the original art. Some scenes were drawn a bit poorly though. There\u2019s this one particular scene where Simca (one of the girls in Ikki\u2019s mini harem) drawn really fat. I don\u2019t know why, but I laughed way too much more than I should. Aside from the funny looking characters, Air Gear\u2019s art is quite good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nMusic and soundtracks on Air Gear were fair. Background music during the show is decent, too. I kinda like the OP theme. As for the ED theme, I have no idea if the lyrics were English or Japanese. So I didn\u2019t bother listening to it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nGood thing the Oh! Great (Ooguri, Ito, is his real name. See the pun? I loled when I noticed it, too), the author of Air Gear didn\u2019t name his characters wrestling names. Ito loves western wrestling. He named three dogs in the series Stone, Cold, Stunner (?). And there\u2019s this one time when Ikki\u2019s group is thinking of their group name, Kazu offered a name which contains a lot of wrestling finishing moves in it, I think it\u2019s around stone cold stunner hammer pile drive and\u2014ahh, I don\u2019t know. Brushing off his love of western wrestling, Ito did a great job with the characters. He gave them the perfect personality and looks. They were drawn fairly well; Seiyuus did a fine job with the voicing (especially on Ume), too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nAir Gear\u2019s pretty enjoyable. What kinda tick me off in the animation were the flashbacks. This may be biased basis but\u2014it\u2019s what I feel, no? So I\u2019m going to say it anyway. I\u2019m not a fan of flashbacks that much. And I seriously think Air Gear\u2019s animation did a poor job in that category. The flashbacks were incomplete. You\u2019ll be thrown into a what-the-heck-is-going-on situation most of the time. And honestly, Ito should\u2019ve stopped with the useless love flashbacks for side characters. Apart from the annoying flashbacks, I have enjoyed Air Gear.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nAir Gear\u2019s a good shounen series. It contains a lot of action-packed scenes; a mini harem; decent art; and likeable characters. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s a must watch shounen series, but it\u2019s worth trying. 25 episodes (26 if you include the 1 special episode) for a shounen series is not that long. A fair warning though, if you don\u2019t like or worse hate a show which breaks the laws of physics, you should probably stay away from Air Gear. Oh yeah, and it includes a bit of clich\u00e9 moments\u2014camaraderie moments to be more precise, which adds to the generic \u201cshounen\u201d series I was talking about earlier. Bottom line is, I liked Air Gear. It is definitely a decent watch for me.\\n",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite animes. Usually my favorite animes are ones that are more than 100 episode because it becomes my favorite animes because I spend alot of time on it so I get to know the characters alot more. This anime was different because It is like I knew these characters my entire life. Every character in this show is like people I already know. The plot of this story fly is fly. It is not that typical anime where the main character is trying to reach the top. Sometimes you need an anime where you fly and that is what sorelaxing about this anime. I felt like I was flying while watching this. Like legit it was so good the episode flew by. I love it when anime's do not just focus on the main character but builds up other characters around them so u can build bonds with them to. Shows that do this consist of Soul Eater, Naruto, and My Hero Academia. To be honest I never expected an anime like this to come out of the fan service genre of the funimation app. Anyways about the shows characters I had bonds with not just the main character but a few of my other fav characters such as Onigiri, Mikura, Kazuma, and Bifu, Hitoshi. These group of characters I mentioned are not usually seen as main characters but in this show they are according to Mal. To be honest this has been the best sports anime and only sports anime I have ever watched. 2 years ago I would of never wanted to watch a sports anime but now I feel like I want to watch a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the art I would say it could of done better for 2007 because shows such as ToraDora and MyBrideAsAMermaid had better quality animation but I understand it was most likely on a budget. \\n\r\nIF this show aired maybe a couple years earlier actually only like 1 year I think it would of been alot better. The sound is the reason I was able to fly with the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe songs and soundtracks reminded me alot like the Naruto soundtrack but underated. It is very catchy to the point why I am listening to it right now while writing this review. It is perfect for the sports theme and goes very well in intense scenes with the characters. The intro is really good to. If the sound tracks were not as good this anime would most likely not be one of my favorite animes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters like I said in the beginning can is related to me in alot of ways and most likely related to alot of other people or just people in general. My favorite character is the real main character but the side main characters and the girl Noyamano, Ringo and Simca has been on and off for me I can not decide between both of them for the main character. Near the end no spoilers involved it gets intense between these to and I really do not like how the character development went but that is not through the main anime but the OVA and the manga tbh I really do not like the direction the manga took it so if I was to rate everything it would be a 8 just because the soundtrack stops this from being so trash the Ova but i would rate the Ova a 0. I wish I would not of seen it. Even though their was one scene that touched my heart alot of scenes broke it. I was expecting an Ova to be all fun and games but they had to make it some of the biggest plotlines and twist's its crazy. \\n\\n\r\n The enjoyment of the anime was lit even though it flew by really fast. If this show was 1000 episodes I would gladly watch all of them even if they were filler. If it had the budget I am sure it can make 1000 episodes. The enjoyment is a 10 because of the great music and soundtrack loveable characters and action packed roller skating.\\n\\n\r\nOveral thanks for reading and I give this anime a 10 and one of my favorite animes. EVER!!! Be sure to add me as a friend and check out my profile so we could talk if you want. Also if you disagree be free to leave a comment so we could start beef and all.\\n",

            "content": "Air Gear\r\n+++Positives\r\nAir Gear is without any doubt COOL. Everything from the catchy OP and ED, the slick presentation and the surprising sophistry of ideas behind ordinary roller-blading scream COOL. There is a wicked sense of humour prevalent throughout the anime, and the frequent crude jokes will definitely get a laugh out of you. The sense of competitiveness which any sport inspires is very nicely captured, there's a lot of yelling and foot-stamping but it never gets boring. \r\n\tThe characterization is very good, although full of the typical anime cliches - angry young kid with \"hidden\" talents, gorgeous shy chick who loves our hero and alsokicks ass when required, etc ... But it's very easy to like the characters, especially the leads, and you will definitely root for Ikki (!!!) as he progresses along the path of the Stormriders. \\n\r\n\tThe art and animation is very consistent throughout. There are a lot of battles where the tension and the excitement is aptly captured. The overall \\n\r\nsound is really excellent. Although often recycled, all the music used is Great and the timing is perfect. I couldn't praise it more.\\n\\n\r\n---Negatives\\n\\n\r\nAir Gear suffers from the basic flaw of most mainstream anime, \"Incomplete Manga-to-Anime Conversion\". The first 15 episodes are brilliant, then the story starts meandering off course. You reach the 22nd ep and you start wondering how the series could possibly end in the next 3 eps. It seems very abrupt and suddenly, Ikki is the promised GOD. I don't know whether the manga continues the story (I've never read one in my life), but it was disappointing. The viewer is promised a showdown between Ikki and some very cool unnamed dudes (The 8 Kings ...), which never happens.      \\n\r\n                 \t     The side characters can get annoying. Especially the chick named Simca (the whole \"mysterious\" & desperate nude hottie who understands the hero's potential even before he does, blah...) and other oddities. Also, \\n\r\nthere's a lot of Animation-Shortcuts used in the battles. It can get irritating when you see Ikki do the same move everytime although he calls it something else, or the way the animation is designed (the camera angles, etc).\\n\\n\r\nWhy You Should Watch...\\n\\n\r\nAir gear is undoubtedly FUN. It's really pleasant viewing and for people who just wanna smoke a few joints and catch a good Sports Anime (which is not 100xx eps long), it's perfect. \\n\r\nThe entire experience of wading through Air Gear definitely exemplifies the ideal of FREEDOM. You just wanna roam outside in the streets at night, even if it's not possible to go up the side of a building wearing blades. The show fulfills it's premise, as in, it provides solid original concepts and some breath-taking entertainment. Definitely Recommended...",

Before you watch this, you need to accept that the plot is bad, random things happen regularly and there is excessive fan service. If you still want to watch it, knowing this, you'll probably enjoy it. Even going back and watching it again years later, I still laugh, and love the characters.\r\nStory: 6/10  You don't watch Air Gear for the plot.\r\nThe plot sounds so stupid I almost skipped it, but i'm glad I didn't.\r\nThe main character Ikki wants to be the best ATrider, and sets up a team. It's generic fighting Shounen anime... On Roller Blades....\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSmooth, colorful animation to enhance  the great fight scenes, beautiful characters, awesome visuals.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nGreat soundtrack that gets your blood pumping, and will leave you smiling.\\n\r\nReally cool mix of Hip-Hop, J-pop and Rock.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is the shows main selling point. A lot of the characters are clich\u00e9s,  but they're done so well and they all receive enough screen time to really make them interesting and make you enjoy them.

            "content": "This review is 100% spoilerless, so feel yourself at home.\r\nOkay, i am going to make it short and simple. Watch Air Gear. Even if this anime isn't of your tastes or you are going to end up disliking it, still completely worth it. Such works as this appear once in a long period, after all.\r\nLike most of the genre, main character is going to be fighting for the top. But this time, instead of a typical loser guy we have the one who usually is to bully, one of the local \"Ganza\" and simply a badass. This changes a lot, as the whole story hasa lot more ground to cover and go about. In fact, all characters here are well developed and unique, each one is interesting to watch and easily remembered. There might be a little of cliche, such as mc's sister (NOT the little genki \"onichan-this-onichan-that\" sort you usually see in harems), but i promise this isn't going to be any problem. Right the other way, in fact. I would have even tried to say this anime is completely uncliched, but this sounds too rough and isn't really the truth. But still.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part about this everything is the storyline, which begins quite action-packed and goes on like that for almost whole anime. This, off course, leaves place for some philosophy our friends from Japan like so much, but it is all so well served i haven't got tired of it until the end, which actually means something. All serious moments are always going to be softened with a little bit of a joke or character's \"unseriousness\". This all combined, it is both very easy and interesting to watch, so there is a high chance you're going to go through fast and have a lot of positive feelings at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe very special thing here is the soundtrack. You can just go to the Youtube and type in \"Skanfunk\" to listen to it as i don't think i could find the correct words to describe it. We are met by an atmosphere of 80s-90s with gangs fightings and roller-skating. If you played anything of Jet Set Radio, you should understand well. Word \"Funk\" fits just perfect here. This makes key moments even better, completely the type of music you want to listen to after beating the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNo, for the bad part. In fact, i consider this the only reason this anime is so underrated. Graphics. The animation is just poor. I would even say there is almost no animation at all. This is just sad. There is a lot of crazy insane tricking around the place and you're going to see this in such a lame quality, frustrating all the way through. They animated some tricks though, so there are still things to watch. And the characters are very good too. And there is a lot of fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nThis all concluded, Air Gear is an underrated masterpiece. Something everyone must watch. Something that is so easy to fall in love with and so hard to just forget.\\n\\n\r\nMust watch, 9\\10.\\n\r\nGood luck and have a nice ride.",

They all have a distinctive trait which makes them easy to remember and easier to distinguish. But that's only the surface layer, they almost all have a deep backstory that unravels throughout the episodes and are mostly unexpected and keep shrouded in mystery until the time is right.",

It's a sports anime with plenty of fan service, but the story is still enjoyable.

            "content": "Air gear is about a special kind of skates with a motor attached known as air treks. The story revolves around the life of Ikki a middle school student who learns about air trek and has humoungous talent and interest in the air treks and as a result is soon sucked into the world of air treks. \r\nI found the story a very unique and orignal shounen anime. Of course you would expect the usual qualities like perserverance, determination and stuff being eminated by the protagonist but what made this so attractive was how they created such an interesting story from skates with motors inthem. A good deal of action and a tinge of drama makes this a worthwhile watch and to top it off the comedy is at a decent level, though the anime can be quite eichi at times. The character development is quite good as well but of course there is a smaller focus on romance and more on freindship.The story will appeal to those who like action, comedy or shounen genre...a must-watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was average. It was at a decent level but nothing exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in terms of OP and ED songs were not bad. I think the voice actors did quite a good job and the voices matchd the characters perfectly. The inserts towards the end of the anime were quite effective in bringing out the atmosphere but too bad they only used one song. Still a good effort overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters had some depth but most of the focus was still on the protagonist. Perhaps due to time constraints or budget problems the anime could not elaboate more on the characters as is done in many of the big time shounen animes like bleach, reborn! or naruto. Still the it was quite entertaining anyway for a 25 episode series.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the anime because it was something fresh and new compared to the usual shounen animes with special powers and all. This anime was more realistic or closer to real life and the fights were spectacular.The comedy was also quite entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is a must see for shounen lovers and those who seek originality. This anime had a lot of potential. If it had lasted longer or if there was a second series it would definitely have done better in attracting viewers.As it was a bit rushed towards the end of the series, it was a bit hard to enjoy it towards the end, there is a possibility of a movie coming up and i will definitely look foward to it and any future development in this series.",

The characters where really like-able but as far as character development in the story, they didn't do such a great job. The art in the show is fairly good on par with shows like Zero no Tsukaima. The story is really good but can get complicated at times. I really enjoyed this anime and for me it reached my #1 anime pretty quick. I would also like to state thatthe show ends with an anime only ending that sucks, but that's only because the show covers only to chapter 104 in the manga and the manga itself has 357 chapters. One more thing I forgot to point out that the comedy in this show is dirty so if you don't like dick jokes and stuff like that than this probably won't be as enjoyable for you.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show to anyone who likes good comedy, music, and a good story.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to say thank you to those who took the time to read this review and I hope that it helped you in anyway possible.\\n\r\n:)",

            "content": "Story: 8/10 It\u2019s Progressive but the ending is a let down.\r\nWhen I started up the first episode of Air Gear I was pretty amazed by the opening scene, from the male protagonist looking over the horizon searching for new experiences to the following up\u2019s and down\u2019s within the opening scene\u2019s. The ability to over come his obstacles, seeking higher limits and soaring up to the expectations.\r\nI enjoyed the basis of the narrative that it was based on kids with motorized roller blades. I must say given the fact that this is based on roller blading, I was left beseeching for a second season. I canonly hope that FUNimation Entertainment is working on the next season.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animations themselves are very good even for a major fan base. Women are \u201cgifted\u201d as in other various anime\u2019s. The scenes where they are racing or battling has been put together very well adding new elements were you least expected it. The desire to own their shoes as they race from rooftop to rooftop is unimaginable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music really helps set the pace of the series, especially during the action sequences. The audio from the band Back-On with the song Chain goes very well with the opening theme as mentioned above\u2026\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe focus on character development is truly what makes the world of Air Treks enjoyable every character has his/hers aspirations, goals in life and they way in which they can achieve it is by using Air Treks to do so. As most fan based anime\u2019s some of the characters are pretty anime clich\u00e9 from the supporting character Onigiri who is a pervert and characterized as a pig inwhich he rides up side down on his head in which he is referred to as a upside down Buddha, without giving to much away.\\n\r\nThe understanding of the character archetypes/stereotypes  are easy to understand, Almost every character  in the series has their comical moments whether it's being perverted, goofy, or just \u2018out to get you\u2019\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall my main enjoyment came from the narrative based about roller blading, not to say there aren\u2019t other anime\u2019s based on racing such as rideback, but the understanding that there is a subgenre for skaters is quite cool if I may say so.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "Story: 8/10 Not too bad all things considered.\r\nWhen I started up the first episode of Air Gear I was pretty skeptical. I almost let this one pass by just on the basis that it was based on kids with motorized roller blades. However by the third episode I was completely hooked. I then proceeded to cram 25 episodes in over the span of the night. I must say given the fact that this is based on roller blading I was very impressed with the story presentation, and by the end of the 25th episode I was left begging for a second season. I can onlyhope that the anime gods are working on granting me this wish right now. Along with Berserk that is.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10/10 Gotta love the fan service.\\n\r\nEverything looks great. Women are well endowed as it should be, and a couple of them don't mind being slutty. Giggity giggity goo. Hell Ikki even busts out some master Roshi style nose bleeds. The scenes where they are racing or battling are truly amazing. It makes you yearn to be in their shoes as they race from rooftop to rooftop flying through the whole city, or how about kicking your worst enemy in the face going about 60 m.p.h? It does suffer from some pauses during the middle of battles, but it isn't enough to deter you as it really helps with character development.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music really helps set the pace of the series, especially during the action sequences. My only problem with it is sometimes it gives away what is about to happen. By that I mean they key it in during the end of a battle or when someone is about to make a big accomplishment. Still it helps to keep you on the edge of your seat waiting in suspense.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, Enjoyment: 10/10 Hand-in-hand.\\n\r\nAn excellent job. The focus on character development is truly what makes the world of Air Treks enjoyable. I'll admit some of the characters are pretty anime cliche, but Air Gear goes a lot further by flushing them out well. Characters are easy to understand, and feel. Almost everyone in the series has their humorous moments whether it's being perverted, clumsy, or just plain sleazy you'll love it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall my main enjoyment came from all the characters. Al though sometimes their actions are enough to make you wince, you'll still fall in love with them all.  \\n",

            "content": "Air Gear is one of those anime shows that you will either love to death or be turned away from it by its weird style.  Its very....how should I put it, \"open,\" in a way like Tenjou Tenje is.  The girls are revealing, the main character, Ikki,  has no shame (as this is shown by him taking a dump in front of EVERYONE while a skating match is going on).  Nevertheless, if you enjoy this kind of humor or can get by it, Air Gear shapes up to be a good introduction anime from its manga counterpart.\r\nThe story is relatively thesame, as with many other sport anime shows.  Ikki wants to be an amazing Air Trek rider (that is what they call themselves) and what he does not know is that the people he lives with are part of the legendary Sleeping Forest Air Trek team.  They try to persuade Ikki from rollerblading because they do not want him to be involved with the drama that comes along with it, but of course, they fail.  Otherwise, this anime would have ended at episode 2.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, each Trek team has the goal of reaching the top of the pyramid, to the A class - to be the best team and trekkers in the world.  And in order for them to do so, they must compete in various kinds of competitions to win the badge of the other team.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is top-notch, clean, smooth and colorful.  They have done a great job and many of the characters and their details.  The women in the show all look gorgeous, to say the least.  \\n\\n\r\nSince its been awhile since I have seen this show, I honestly don't remember how good the music is.  However, as I listen to some of the songs that I have on my computer, I find it being so-so, so I gave it a rating accordingly.  But don't trust me too much on this topic.  Hehe.  ^_^.\\n\\n\r\nAs I have already mentioned, all of the characters are drawn well and have somewhat different personalities.  However, nobody is unique in the sense that you'll be like &quot;Whoa!  I have never seen that in any other anime before.&quot;  As you will find that a lot of the personalties people have can be compared to other characters in other anime shows.  Again, character development is mainly measured by development in their Air Trekking skills.  There really isn't too much of a change in personality in each character to give it much distinction.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you are looking for an intense, action-packed sport, look no further than Air Gear.  The big disappointing thing I have with this show is that the first 25 episodes cover only a very small portion of the manga and I have yet to see any updates in a season 2 of the show.  So I don't know the status of the future of Air Gear at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't read the manga yet, but I heard from many people that it is amazing and a must-read if you have the time.  So once you are introduced to the world of Air Gear with the anime, I would advise to pick up the manga and become even further immersed with the story.",

            "content": "Air Gear is a pretty cool Shounen, Sports, Comedy anime about a teenage boy Itsuki Minami &ldquo;Ikki&rdquo; who ends up thrown into the competitive sport of Air Trek. Being drawn into this extreme sport, Ikki makes it his goal to reach the pinnacle of AT. Although it would have done better without the typical clich&eacute;s, inconsistent plot and countless fan service. ^_^ \r\nAt first glance you might just think of it as rollerblading, with add-ons in the form of an anime but Air Gear manages to pull of a pretty exciting anime with this basic concept. From the beginning something that helps this average-length showis the pace the story and the characters development that will leave you feeling satisfied after each episode. Speaking of the characters, most of their personalities are fairly clich&eacute;d like Ikki who is the sort of male protagonist who&rsquo;s good at heart but doesn&rsquo;t take crap from anyone. Apart from all the rollerblading there&rsquo;s also some action in the series but sometimes it could have done better without. Well of course this can&rsquo;t be a true shounen anime without the action, comedy and fan service.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of animation is a good for the show, with it able to convey the sports, comedy and fan service side of things well. It&rsquo;s only the lack of fluid animation that is a problem and this anime would have been so much better, if only a production studio like &ldquo;Madhouse&rdquo; took it on.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is perfectly incorporated into the show with a variety of hip hop, alternative rock and J-pop. The show&rsquo;s opening theme is what exemplifies the possibility of these types of music complimenting each other.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Air Gear turns out to be a pretty exciting sports anime to watch with the main story easy enough to follow that kids can watch it, but with all the fanservice, its not advised. Even though the story develops well enough, there is a lot of stuff that is randomly added in which further complicates this anime (like Regalia and Genesis). In the end this is an anime that deserves a second series and hopefully by then the animation quality would be better. \\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "All things given, this is my first review. Please don't hit on me too hard for what I say as I'm inexperienced when it comes to writing reviews. I'll get better as I write more.\r\nI'm gonna start things off with saying how I watched the dubbed version of this. Though I can't imagine it mattering much when it comes to this show, it'd be helpful knowledge regardless. Air gear.. was a bit disappointing. The show had great potential and yet was executed poorly. \r\nStory 5/10\r\nAir Gear's story was bland. One kid finds these things called ATs, loves them, and apparently is the destined king orsomething. He comes naturally good at them. This kind of story has been retold in probably many anime; Air Gear just doesn't tell it as well as some others do. It's predictable, poorly paced where it feels there are filler episodes at strange places, and even the end was abrupt and boring.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the show is pretty darn good. The style represented the dark feel of the show when needed but had a light undertone when things were bright and cheery. Character designs were nice and very different from one another. Even if you couldn't remember the names of characters, each character looked so different that it would be impossible to mix them up. Props for that. The animation was pretty good too when it wasn't trying to intentionally be cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI'd be a liar if I said that the music of this show didn't pump me up when it needed to. It knew when to play sad, happy, intense, or whatever atmosphere you needed at the time. They reuse the same theme quite a bit, but it never seemed to get tiring.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry but.. Tom-Tom.. Why was she a character? Rant aside, some characters were written pretty well while others just flopped. The main character was in between as he often did things that would seem just over the top, even for him. Some characters revolved around being pervs. Others improved themselves as the show went on. My favorite character however had a neat perk that's been done before in different ways. If people remember Lunch/Launch from Dragon Ball, it's sort of like that. The big difference being the character's split personality was triggered by an eye patch covering the other persona's eye and that said persona's were aware of the others existence and knew some of the things the other did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI've watch anime that has me hooked with formulas like these and Air Gear failed to do that. It felt like a chore to watch with all the fan service it throws at you. It's enough to make someone sick. Not only that though, the story's blandness and the predictability the show has doesn't compliment the art or the sound well. The show also seems to forget a sub-plot they were trying to form near the end. The fact that the end is abrupt makes you assume there'd be a sequel of some kind, bringing that sub-plot back but nope. That was it. I'd stay away from this show.",

            "content": "EDIT: This review has been edited since finishing the series.\r\nThis is my first review so here goes nothing.\r\nI can\u2019t actually remember why I started watching Air Gear, but that\u2019s beside the point. The plot intrigued me and I gave it a go. I thought that I would perhaps like it, but I was completely wrong. I detested this show.\r\nThe story itself isn\u2019t all that bad, but it is a bit clich\u00e9d. A kid gets hooked on the latest sport fad (Air Treks or ATs for short) and wants to become the best at it. So he forms a team with his friends to try andmake it to the top. It seems like it could work out really well, but let me tell you, at seventeen episodes in, absolutely nothing happens. Sure, they battle a few other teams and get somewhat better, but nothing drastic has happens otherwise. Maybe it\u2019s just the way they paced the show, but that's all it is until episode twenty-six and it thoroughly dissapoints. The show ends rather ubruptly as well, and it leaves the viewer asking far too many questions. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems to me that the animation company had doubts on how well the show would do, so every two seconds they decided to throw in: a) a naked girl b) a guy fantasizing about a naked girl c) a guy looking up a girl\u2019s skirt d) a guy attempting to grope a girl or e) all of the above. Now, I don\u2019t mind the fan service every so often (what\u2019s a shonen series without it?), but this show pushed the limits and put it in for no reason whatsoever. It\u2019s almost like it was an ecchi show with sports, not a sports show with some ecchi thrown in.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and art in this show aren\u2019t all that special, but I\u2019ve become somewhat fond of the opening and ending. I\u2019m all for the stupid chibi (could they even be called that? They looked more demented than cute) versions they make of the characters every so often, but I wasn\u2019t too thrilled with it overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe only aspect of this show that I really enjoyed was the back story between Rika and Sora. It was extremely touching, and I wouldn\u2019t have minded if the show was only about them. I honestly hated the other character and found them to be mainly anime stereotypes, Mary-Sues and Gary-Stus if you will. I think the series would have been so much more enjoyable if the characters were more interesting and more original. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want a great show with an interesting plot and great characters, turn around and look somewhere else. If you\u2019re looking for boobs every other minute, be my guest and plow through all twenty-six episodes of this disaster. \\n\\n\r\nThe breakdown:\\n\r\nAnimation: 7\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nPlot/Story: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nAir Gear had the potential to be amazing, but it isn\u2019t. But I guess that\u2019s expected when the creator has a penname like \u201cOh! Great.\u201d\\n",

            "content": "Air Gear is definitely an interesting series to review. I'm a rare breed -- a person who watched the anime before reading the manga, and thus, I think I have a fresh perspective on the story. I'm not comparing it to the manga as many fans do with anime adaptations. \"OMG! They left out my favorite scene with the spatula!!11oneone This anime suxxr0rs!\" is an exaggeration of a complaint voiced by fans of a certain series: the adaptation isn't true to the original work, therefore, it isn't as good as the original work. I, however, had nothing to compare this anime to, so I believemy review will be free of &quot;fan-bias&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nSo what did I think of this series watching it from a fresh-faced, new-minded, open-hearted attitude?\\n\\n\r\nAir Gear is an interesting piece. The premise is about motorized roller-blades (Air Treks) that allow you to skate fast and even fly in the air. (Awesome, right?) The premise sounds like a fabulous set-up for a futuristic shonen sports anime. However, this description doesn't accurately describe what Air Gear is all about.\\n\\n\r\nThe series follows Itsuki (Ikki) Minami, the leader of a small Junior High gang made up of his two best friends, Kazu and Onigiri. Ikki gets into loads of fights and is pretty much a deliquent. But when he gets thoroughly beat down by a group of a team of Storm Riders (those who ride Air Treks) he wants revenge, and he wants to do it their way.\\n\\n\r\nIkki gets a hold of a pair of Air Treks from the Noyamono sisters, a group of four (sexy) girls who have looked after Ikki since he was a small child. Rika, the oldest, is level-headed and maternal, but can lose her temper at times. Mikan, High school aged, is short-tempered and tomboyish. Ringo, who is Ikki's age and has quite a crush on him, is smart, sweet, and talented. And Ume, the littlest, is a bit creepy at times, but mostly cute. Little does Ikki know that these four used to make up Sleeping Forest, a top-ranked Air Trek team with serious street cred.\\n\\n\r\nHe learns to ride Air Treks and it becomes clear from early on that Ikki has talent. A prodigy, some might say. After various Air Trek adventures, he forms his own team, Kogarasumaru, made up of himself, Kazu, Onigiri, a former rival named Buccha, and a little psychotic Storm Rider with MPD, Akito/Agito.\\n\\n\r\nThe story chronicles Ikki's journey with Kogarasumaru, but it focuses more on Ikki has an individual. I wouldn't call this a &quot;sports anime&quot; by any means -- it's far too dramatic for that. Now, while I know sports anime can get pretty serious at times, this &quot;sport&quot; ended up being so dramatic, it came to life and death. Storm Riders do not compete for fun -- they compete to survive, to rise up, and to become the best.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the biggest question I have for this series:\\n\\n\r\nWhy?\\n\\n\r\nTo me, Air Treks sound like a bunch of fun. You get to skate around and fly in the sky and be awesome overall. So why in the world has this been reduced to such serious business? There's a whole hierarchy of Storm Riders, and super parts called &quot;Regalias&quot; that only Kings can possess. Oh, and if you want to be the Sky King, you have to defeat everyone else in a big Tower Tournament thing (it was explained rather poorly. Considering the anime never even got to the Tower, I didn't pay it much mind.) Throughout the whole series, I was stopping and saying, &quot;Wait a minute...this is supposed to be fun, right?&quot;\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to say this right now. Air Gear had the potential to be fun. But it isn't. It's funny at times, but it's never fun. I never get that sense of frivolity and joy watching it that I get when I watch other sports anime. I'm never saying &quot;Go Kogarasumaru!&quot; because I'm too busy saying, &quot;HOLY SHIT KOGARASUMARU YOU'RE ALL GONNA DIE!&quot;. Seriously, some Air Trek battles are nothing but street brawls on roller blades. How boring is that? The biggest team fight of the series is nothing but a big violent fight on Air Treks, and I think, &quot;The hell? Take off the skates and just hit each other.&quot;\\n\\n\r\nNow there have been pretty crazy premises in some anime. Far more crazy than this. I think the reason I don't buy this whole &quot;I'm going to use this super fun piece of technology to beat people up so I can be the best&quot; is because there is never adequate reason given. Why do they want to be the best? For the sake of being the best. Okay, so...why? To me, it makes no sense. They try to explain it with some mumbo jumbo about wanting to &quot;grab the sky&quot; or &quot;fly as high as you can&quot;, but it all reads very forced instead of endearing or captivating.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the &quot;grab the sky&quot; stuff, there is FAR too much time wasted in this series pontificating at length about how Ikki is going &quot;to be the one to grasp the sky in his fists&quot; or some Japanese random inspirational dialogue. If I heard one more person talk about Ikki flying in the sky, I was going to scream. &quot;I get it!&quot; I wanted to yell, &quot;FLYING IS A METAPHOR FOR FREEDOM! Ikki flies without worry! I get it! You can stop it now!&quot; The pontificating of Ikki also got on my nerves. One more revelation about Air Treks and how they've built his character, and I was ready to just vomit.\\n\\n\r\nNow, all this makes it seem like I didn't enjoy the series. I'm not going to lie. Air Gear is by no means fabulous. It's not a gem of anime by any means. At times, it's downright boring. But when it comes to this over-the-top, far too heavy tale, the characters become the saving grace.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Air Gear are very real. I can imagine knowing them. Despite Ikki's annoying monologues, he's an endearing hero, and you actually want to see him succeed. His friends are great, although I wish they would've been explored a bit more. Ringo, who is explored very much, is by far my favorite character in the series. She has so many levels, she isn't just the &quot;cute anime girl with the crush on the hero&quot; by any means. She kicks more ass than Ikki on Air Treks, she's sweet without being a pushover, and she's flawed. She's overbearing and tries to hard to protect the ones she loves, which is such a human quality. Akito/Agito are also great. Both are very distinct, although I wish Akito would have gotten more screen time. We spent too much time on the rough and harsh Agito in my opinion. I can tell why most Air Gear cosplayers cosplay Akito/Agito. He's very lovable.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great thing about this show is the animation. It's detailed and clean, and the Air Trek battles are animated with style. I love effort being put into the art of an anime, and this one definitely shows effort.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also FABULOUS. BEST music I have heard in an anime in a long, long, time. I found myself bopping to some of the tracks. The OST of this series is definitely on my wishlist (or my torrent list, lol.)\\n\\n\r\nWhat this series, and all of Oh-Great's mangas, is full of is gratutious fan-service. That's right, busty babes wearing pretty much nothing, showing off what their momma gave them every chapter. People have complimented &quot;Oh-Great!&quot; on his &quot;fabulous females&quot;. I assume they mean the art, because besides Ringo and Simca, every female in this series is nothing but a pair of walking, talking tits and ass. I don't blame Oh-Great! He knows what the readers like, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nAir Gear has been heavily criticized for its ending. It just kinda...ends...in the middle of the manga. There were only 25 episodes produced, and thus, the series ended rather strangely, with plenty of plot holes. Still, I thought the ending was handled very well. It was an ending that brought closure (not much, but enough) and gave me that &quot;okay, now it's over&quot; feeling. I think, however, it would have been in their best interest to have continued the anime. Maybe the ratings just weren't supporting it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think Air Gear is a great idea executed mediocrely. The series is too dark, too heavy, with no adequate explanation for its tone beyond some random flying and wings metaphors. Still, it has some good things to offer: great characters, fun animation, awesome music, and the opportunity to fantasize about flying roller-blades.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I've decided that I'm going to give the manga a try and see if it's any better than the anime. I've heard great things, so why not? I'll just catch up gradually I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10",

            "content": "I think I have a newfound respect for anybody that enjoys this show. Not because it's a bad show, but because it's a bad show that somehow gathers a respectable amount of fans. Air Gear is bad. It's not just bad, it's probably the worst show I've ever seen.\r\nHave you ever seen a review with big bold caps streaming the headline blatantly screaming to you \"WORST SHOW EVER\"? Everybody that writes a bad review often tells it that way, but it means there are about a hundred other \"WORST SHOWS EVER\". I admit to watching plenty of shows within the span of my daily life,and it takes me a while to rethink a show and decide whether or not I like it. Some for better, some for worse, but the truth is, I've never seen an anime show that I've truly regret watching, not even those I would want to watch again. Air Gear is radically different.\\n\\n\r\nStory: I rated the story 7/10. This is well-deserved and dignified, because let's face it, how often do you see an anime show about rollerblades? In Air Gear's defense, it may be the only one of its kind. The issue I had with the story is the really quick pickup towards the last couple episodes, where suddenly the plot dove full-throttle into a wall, as if this was a show wishing for itself to end. What can I say to that, aside from calm down and flow a little more naturally? Nothing much, especially when the first couple of episodes emphasized falling over and over again. It was nice to see him falling without the slightest clue as to what he was doing the first times, but how about an episode where he DOESN'T fall from something every so often? You're not a factory, so please stop your blatant repetition.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation is world-class, similar to how you would say Shingeki no Kyojin has some of the best art direction in an anime show, but for the first couple of episodes, I had to readjust my preferences until the art style sank in, unlike Shingeki no Kyojin which doesn't borrow elements from the \"common\" anime yet still managed to draw me in the moment it began (without regards to what was actually happening). The look as a whole did remind me of Samurai Champloo, especially with the presence of Minami Itsuki who vaguely resembled Mugen, and given the setting in a modern-day urban environment, I was pretty much sold. It looks good and the story is nice, that should give me an incentive to stick around.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Another anime with a badass soundtrack, a sick opening theme, and better sprites and sound effects than can be produced with a Korg synthesizer (of course I'm exaggerating), the music is something to behold for sure. If I could say so myself, Air Gear has one of the best soundtracks out there, behind a musical, in which music is the main focus. Based on Story, Art, and Sound, I was almost convinced that I would be watching another masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nALMOST convinced.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I was thoroughly disappointed with the characters. Minami Itsuki lives in a world where he happens to be the main protagonist of a sports show, so what's up with this guy? He has no shame and even used the \"public restroom\" during one of the battles, and just like all the other guys in this show, they're ALL perverts. That brings me to the case of Noyamano Ringo, a girl that Itsuki lives with. She must have some insane type of unrequited love, especially to fall in love with a guy like Itsuki. In fact, what about Simca, who is supposedly \"in love\" with Itsuki? She obviously takes kindly to being the whore of the AT world, especially when it becomes a hobby to show up nude in front of a guy that you didn't like at the very beginning.These characters have a lack of common sense, and unlike a comedy that recognizes stupid characters, Air Gear simply allows them to happen, and to this day, I believe they're dead serious about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: What's the genre for Air Gear, sports? I also believe that they've thrown in a couple of other genres in there, like Comedy, Action, Romance, all the typical anime genres. That's the thing I found strange about Air Gear. Its genre is so confused, if Air Gear were human and you ran a sexuality test on it, the reading would come out as \"inconclusive\". Air Gear FAILS to recognize its own genre, and instead of giving it the right amount of comedy, action, and romance, Air Gear throws all of them into a blender, minces it, and hopes it tastes good. By this time, the formula is bitter, and you can't even taste what it was supposed to be to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nAnd Air Gear doesn't stop at trying to mix the genres above. It also adds more to a formula that it can't get correctly. Instead of identifying what it's supposed to be and allowing them to exist without twisting them into a quite unpleasant experience, it's also trying to tell you, \"oh yeah, did we mention we're also an Ecchi?\" If you did not understand any bit of my analogy, this is what it means: Air Gear tries to blend Comedy, Action, and Romance, and also tries to get by on adding an ecchi scene \"here and there\". It's the reverse order, in reality. Air Gear is an Ecchi show before anything. THEN it gets to be a Romantic Action Comedy that doesn't happen to be funny, nor romantic, and it just happens to have action in it. Air Gear's genre is so confused that it allows serious events to be complemented with a terrible sense of humor, comedy that's hardly impressive and so lackluster that you could watch with a straight face.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The art is appealing, the sound is studded with quality, and the story is decent minus that enormous quirk at the very end, but the characters are hardly notable and trying to find the non-Ecchi parts of Air Gear is like searching for a needle in a haystack: you need to be searching actively to find those parts.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong. The show has its incredible moments. High-velocity action sequences, a badass soundtrack, and some of the best art direction to ever be found in an anime show, but take it down to the other elements and there's no redeeming qualities in the fields of characters, enjoyment, and content. There's simply nothing about those three categories that could pick this show up off its feet and allow it to compete with even the most generic of shows.\\n\\n\r\nAir Gear seriously has the potential to be something amazing, taking something generally \"uncool\" and giving it a reboot into something much easier to appreciate, but the very fact that it can't mix genres well and can't even identify what it is to begin with leaves it much to be desired. I know it has the potential to be amazing, but it can't be unless it throws out the Ecchi, the horrid Comedy, the forgettable characters, and learns to blend its own elements correctly.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I've just come to the realization that I described the entire show. I guess there's simply no way I will ever like this show.",

            "content": "Just when you think there are already too many battle shounens out there, here comes another. However, I appreciate the fact that Air Gear at least comes with a unique concept. Regardless, a battle shounen is a battle shounen and it all comes down to presentation that decides whether or not an anime stands out in its genre. Unfortunately, that isn't quite the case for Air Gear. It is definitely enjoyable but it doesn't present anything new to the table. If you plan to watch this anime expecting a masterpiece, prepare to be disappointed; but if you just come in for a good time, thenhelp yourself.\\n\\n\r\nStory (25%) - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe plot starts out the same as any battle shounen; there's a special sport/power with a special tournament which has special people participating. The MC suddenly gets exposed to it, wants to join, forms a team, etc. This seems generic but would have actually been fine considering that the characters and city setting seem suited for this kind of plot. However, the writer suddenly got ambitious and decided to insert some epic, grand plot to keep everyone tuned in. From there, the plot becomes a mess as it keeps us begging for answers but obviously there isn't enough time to answer half of them in a 25 episode show. It would have been nice to know at least just how they seem to gain superpowers from using mechanized roller blades, but we don't even get that. All in all though, nothing gets too dragged out and the story is at least internally coherent and simple albeit incomplete as it only covers about 1/3 of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt (20%) - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds and character designs are simply breathtaking. There isn't a single frame which looks ugly and the characters are well-proportioned. Animation is fluid, which really does wonders for an action anime such as this. The way in which the city's atmosphere blends magically with the more surreal fantasy, supernatural-ish dream world thingy is also superb. If only they did a better job at explaining that world, the transition might have been flawless. There are a few things the art does kinda bad, but these are few and usually occur with minor details of supporting characters, so they can easily be ignored.\\n\\n\r\nSound (20%) - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the anime truly shines. I swear to the god I don't believe in that the soundtrack is one of the best in anime. Considering that the opening song basically started the career of its creators, you know you can expect something good. More than half the songs in its soundtrack can be listened to on their own and every song fits its scene nicely. The atmosphere is not only preserved by the sound, it is greatly enhanced by it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (25%) - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely the anime's weakest point. The characters don't have much variation with other shounen archetypes. The only ones remotely interesting are Agito and Ringo. And even they aren't that different in the shounen genre. However, I think they make up for their individual blandness by their good chemistry with each other. Although even this gets ruined by the excessive fanservice the show shoves in your face. Nonetheless, the characters are likable (for the most part) and they move the story along well enough. Don't expect them to be serious though as basically every character is a comic relief character at some point, usually accompanied by fanservice. There also isn't much development among its characters. Only Ikki and Kazu get some degree of development and even that is rather superficial. But considering this is shounen, it's at least something.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10%) - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is popcorn material no question. It may suddenly give you some deep-sounding quote out of nowhere for no reason but you'd have to be a fool to take it seriously, especially considering the tits and ass shots outnumber those quotes 2 to 1. If you expect some action and comedy, you'll be pleasantly surprised when the anime gives you exactly that plus the great art and sound. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt may have a great soundtrack and visuals but no story and characters to remember it by. It is entertaining but I seriously doubt that it will leave an impact on anyone. Still, it is worth your time if for the visuals and sound alone.",

            "content": "Roller blades are cool, but motorized roller blades are waaaay much too cooler. This brings us to Air Gear.  Air Gear is a show which obviously originated from roller blades. You either like the show or get annoyed at it for breaking the laws of physics (which most of the series out there do. dude, its anime). \r\nSince I\u2019ve just recently watched Air Gear, I have no idea what the manga version is. So to be precise, I\u2019ll be doing this review for the animation only.\r\nStory: 7\r\nAir Gear\u2019s story isn\u2019t that different from the other shounen shows out there. We all got to admitthat shounen shows are jam-packed with clich\u00e9 events. But that\u2019s one of the many charms of the genre. As I was saying, Air Gear\u2019s a generic shounen series. Minami Itsuki, or simply called as Ikki, is our protagonist. A hot-headed kid who got his assed kicked by a street gang member of the Storm Riders. Upon heading home he discovers a not-so-secret locked room in their house containing a pair of Air Treks, motorized roller blades. He wore the ATs and rode it for the first time in his life. Days after learning how to ride Air Treks, Ikki plans to build his own Storm Riders Gang. As he progresses deeper and deeper to the art of Air Trek, problems arise from left and right. To be able to reach the top, he and his gang needs to widen their territory and improve their rank to challenge stronger riders.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nIf you consider a show almost 9 years ago a classic (who am I kidding? 9 years is pretty damn long), then Air Gear\u2019s art is pretty good. Air Gear\u2019s arts differ in what\u2019s happening currently in the show. For example: the background changes when they ride (AT riding, I mean) the art becomes CG enhanced; you know those cars in Initial D? Yes, they have those, too. There are different drawings for the characters, too. Like when Ikki makes a funny face which really differs from the original art. Some scenes were drawn a bit poorly though. There\u2019s this one particular scene where Simca (one of the girls in Ikki\u2019s mini harem) drawn really fat. I don\u2019t know why, but I laughed way too much more than I should. Aside from the funny looking characters, Air Gear\u2019s art is quite good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nMusic and soundtracks on Air Gear were fair. Background music during the show is decent, too. I kinda like the OP theme. As for the ED theme, I have no idea if the lyrics were English or Japanese. So I didn\u2019t bother listening to it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nGood thing the Oh! Great (Ooguri, Ito, is his real name. See the pun? I loled when I noticed it, too), the author of Air Gear didn\u2019t name his characters wrestling names. Ito loves western wrestling. He named three dogs in the series Stone, Cold, Stunner (?). And there\u2019s this one time when Ikki\u2019s group is thinking of their group name, Kazu offered a name which contains a lot of wrestling finishing moves in it, I think it\u2019s around stone cold stunner hammer pile drive and\u2014ahh, I don\u2019t know. Brushing off his love of western wrestling, Ito did a great job with the characters. He gave them the perfect personality and looks. They were drawn fairly well; Seiyuus did a fine job with the voicing (especially on Ume), too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nAir Gear\u2019s pretty enjoyable. What kinda tick me off in the animation were the flashbacks. This may be biased basis but\u2014it\u2019s what I feel, no? So I\u2019m going to say it anyway. I\u2019m not a fan of flashbacks that much. And I seriously think Air Gear\u2019s animation did a poor job in that category. The flashbacks were incomplete. You\u2019ll be thrown into a what-the-heck-is-going-on situation most of the time. And honestly, Ito should\u2019ve stopped with the useless love flashbacks for side characters. Apart from the annoying flashbacks, I have enjoyed Air Gear.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nAir Gear\u2019s a good shounen series. It contains a lot of action-packed scenes; a mini harem; decent art; and likeable characters. I can\u2019t say it\u2019s a must watch shounen series, but it\u2019s worth trying. 25 episodes (26 if you include the 1 special episode) for a shounen series is not that long. A fair warning though, if you don\u2019t like or worse hate a show which breaks the laws of physics, you should probably stay away from Air Gear. Oh yeah, and it includes a bit of clich\u00e9 moments\u2014camaraderie moments to be more precise, which adds to the generic \u201cshounen\u201d series I was talking about earlier. Bottom line is, I liked Air Gear. It is definitely a decent watch for me.\\n",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite animes. Usually my favorite animes are ones that are more than 100 episode because it becomes my favorite animes because I spend alot of time on it so I get to know the characters alot more. This anime was different because It is like I knew these characters my entire life. Every character in this show is like people I already know. The plot of this story fly is fly. It is not that typical anime where the main character is trying to reach the top. Sometimes you need an anime where you fly and that is what sorelaxing about this anime. I felt like I was flying while watching this. Like legit it was so good the episode flew by. I love it when anime's do not just focus on the main character but builds up other characters around them so u can build bonds with them to. Shows that do this consist of Soul Eater, Naruto, and My Hero Academia. To be honest I never expected an anime like this to come out of the fan service genre of the funimation app. Anyways about the shows characters I had bonds with not just the main character but a few of my other fav characters such as Onigiri, Mikura, Kazuma, and Bifu, Hitoshi. These group of characters I mentioned are not usually seen as main characters but in this show they are according to Mal. To be honest this has been the best sports anime and only sports anime I have ever watched. 2 years ago I would of never wanted to watch a sports anime but now I feel like I want to watch a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the art I would say it could of done better for 2007 because shows such as ToraDora and MyBrideAsAMermaid had better quality animation but I understand it was most likely on a budget. \\n\r\nIF this show aired maybe a couple years earlier actually only like 1 year I think it would of been alot better. The sound is the reason I was able to fly with the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe songs and soundtracks reminded me alot like the Naruto soundtrack but underated. It is very catchy to the point why I am listening to it right now while writing this review. It is perfect for the sports theme and goes very well in intense scenes with the characters. The intro is really good to. If the sound tracks were not as good this anime would most likely not be one of my favorite animes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters like I said in the beginning can is related to me in alot of ways and most likely related to alot of other people or just people in general. My favorite character is the real main character but the side main characters and the girl Noyamano, Ringo and Simca has been on and off for me I can not decide between both of them for the main character. Near the end no spoilers involved it gets intense between these to and I really do not like how the character development went but that is not through the main anime but the OVA and the manga tbh I really do not like the direction the manga took it so if I was to rate everything it would be a 8 just because the soundtrack stops this from being so trash the Ova but i would rate the Ova a 0. I wish I would not of seen it. Even though their was one scene that touched my heart alot of scenes broke it. I was expecting an Ova to be all fun and games but they had to make it some of the biggest plotlines and twist's its crazy. \\n\\n\r\n The enjoyment of the anime was lit even though it flew by really fast. If this show was 1000 episodes I would gladly watch all of them even if they were filler. If it had the budget I am sure it can make 1000 episodes. The enjoyment is a 10 because of the great music and soundtrack loveable characters and action packed roller skating.\\n\\n\r\nOveral thanks for reading and I give this anime a 10 and one of my favorite animes. EVER!!! Be sure to add me as a friend and check out my profile so we could talk if you want. Also if you disagree be free to leave a comment so we could start beef and all.\\n",

            "content": "Air Gear\r\n+++Positives\r\nAir Gear is without any doubt COOL. Everything from the catchy OP and ED, the slick presentation and the surprising sophistry of ideas behind ordinary roller-blading scream COOL. There is a wicked sense of humour prevalent throughout the anime, and the frequent crude jokes will definitely get a laugh out of you. The sense of competitiveness which any sport inspires is very nicely captured, there's a lot of yelling and foot-stamping but it never gets boring. \r\n\tThe characterization is very good, although full of the typical anime cliches - angry young kid with \"hidden\" talents, gorgeous shy chick who loves our hero and alsokicks ass when required, etc ... But it's very easy to like the characters, especially the leads, and you will definitely root for Ikki (!!!) as he progresses along the path of the Stormriders. \\n\r\n\tThe art and animation is very consistent throughout. There are a lot of battles where the tension and the excitement is aptly captured. The overall \\n\r\nsound is really excellent. Although often recycled, all the music used is Great and the timing is perfect. I couldn't praise it more.\\n\\n\r\n---Negatives\\n\\n\r\nAir Gear suffers from the basic flaw of most mainstream anime, \"Incomplete Manga-to-Anime Conversion\". The first 15 episodes are brilliant, then the story starts meandering off course. You reach the 22nd ep and you start wondering how the series could possibly end in the next 3 eps. It seems very abrupt and suddenly, Ikki is the promised GOD. I don't know whether the manga continues the story (I've never read one in my life), but it was disappointing. The viewer is promised a showdown between Ikki and some very cool unnamed dudes (The 8 Kings ...), which never happens.      \\n\r\n                 \t     The side characters can get annoying. Especially the chick named Simca (the whole \"mysterious\" & desperate nude hottie who understands the hero's potential even before he does, blah...) and other oddities. Also, \\n\r\nthere's a lot of Animation-Shortcuts used in the battles. It can get irritating when you see Ikki do the same move everytime although he calls it something else, or the way the animation is designed (the camera angles, etc).\\n\\n\r\nWhy You Should Watch...\\n\\n\r\nAir gear is undoubtedly FUN. It's really pleasant viewing and for people who just wanna smoke a few joints and catch a good Sports Anime (which is not 100xx eps long), it's perfect. \\n\r\nThe entire experience of wading through Air Gear definitely exemplifies the ideal of FREEDOM. You just wanna roam outside in the streets at night, even if it's not possible to go up the side of a building wearing blades. The show fulfills it's premise, as in, it provides solid original concepts and some breath-taking entertainment. Definitely Recommended...",

Before you watch this, you need to accept that the plot is bad, random things happen regularly and there is excessive fan service. If you still want to watch it, knowing this, you'll probably enjoy it. Even going back and watching it again years later, I still laugh, and love the characters.\r\nStory: 6/10  You don't watch Air Gear for the plot.\r\nThe plot sounds so stupid I almost skipped it, but i'm glad I didn't.\r\nThe main character Ikki wants to be the best ATrider, and sets up a team. It's generic fighting Shounen anime... On Roller Blades....\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSmooth, colorful animation to enhance  the great fight scenes, beautiful characters, awesome visuals.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nGreat soundtrack that gets your blood pumping, and will leave you smiling.\\n\r\nReally cool mix of Hip-Hop, J-pop and Rock.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is the shows main selling point. A lot of the characters are clich\u00e9s,  but they're done so well and they all receive enough screen time to really make them interesting and make you enjoy them.

            "content": "This review is 100% spoilerless, so feel yourself at home.\r\nOkay, i am going to make it short and simple. Watch Air Gear. Even if this anime isn't of your tastes or you are going to end up disliking it, still completely worth it. Such works as this appear once in a long period, after all.\r\nLike most of the genre, main character is going to be fighting for the top. But this time, instead of a typical loser guy we have the one who usually is to bully, one of the local \"Ganza\" and simply a badass. This changes a lot, as the whole story hasa lot more ground to cover and go about. In fact, all characters here are well developed and unique, each one is interesting to watch and easily remembered. There might be a little of cliche, such as mc's sister (NOT the little genki \"onichan-this-onichan-that\" sort you usually see in harems), but i promise this isn't going to be any problem. Right the other way, in fact. I would have even tried to say this anime is completely uncliched, but this sounds too rough and isn't really the truth. But still.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part about this everything is the storyline, which begins quite action-packed and goes on like that for almost whole anime. This, off course, leaves place for some philosophy our friends from Japan like so much, but it is all so well served i haven't got tired of it until the end, which actually means something. All serious moments are always going to be softened with a little bit of a joke or character's \"unseriousness\". This all combined, it is both very easy and interesting to watch, so there is a high chance you're going to go through fast and have a lot of positive feelings at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe very special thing here is the soundtrack. You can just go to the Youtube and type in \"Skanfunk\" to listen to it as i don't think i could find the correct words to describe it. We are met by an atmosphere of 80s-90s with gangs fightings and roller-skating. If you played anything of Jet Set Radio, you should understand well. Word \"Funk\" fits just perfect here. This makes key moments even better, completely the type of music you want to listen to after beating the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNo, for the bad part. In fact, i consider this the only reason this anime is so underrated. Graphics. The animation is just poor. I would even say there is almost no animation at all. This is just sad. There is a lot of crazy insane tricking around the place and you're going to see this in such a lame quality, frustrating all the way through. They animated some tricks though, so there are still things to watch. And the characters are very good too. And there is a lot of fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nThis all concluded, Air Gear is an underrated masterpiece. Something everyone must watch. Something that is so easy to fall in love with and so hard to just forget.\\n\\n\r\nMust watch, 9\\10.\\n\r\nGood luck and have a nice ride.",

They all have a distinctive trait which makes them easy to remember and easier to distinguish. But that's only the surface layer, they almost all have a deep backstory that unravels throughout the episodes and are mostly unexpected and keep shrouded in mystery until the time is right.",

            "content": "Air gear is about a special kind of skates with a motor attached known as air treks. The story revolves around the life of Ikki a middle school student who learns about air trek and has humoungous talent and interest in the air treks and as a result is soon sucked into the world of air treks. \r\nI found the story a very unique and orignal shounen anime. Of course you would expect the usual qualities like perserverance, determination and stuff being eminated by the protagonist but what made this so attractive was how they created such an interesting story from skates with motors inthem. A good deal of action and a tinge of drama makes this a worthwhile watch and to top it off the comedy is at a decent level, though the anime can be quite eichi at times. The character development is quite good as well but of course there is a smaller focus on romance and more on freindship.The story will appeal to those who like action, comedy or shounen genre...a must-watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was average. It was at a decent level but nothing exceptional.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in terms of OP and ED songs were not bad. I think the voice actors did quite a good job and the voices matchd the characters perfectly. The inserts towards the end of the anime were quite effective in bringing out the atmosphere but too bad they only used one song. Still a good effort overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters had some depth but most of the focus was still on the protagonist. Perhaps due to time constraints or budget problems the anime could not elaboate more on the characters as is done in many of the big time shounen animes like bleach, reborn! or naruto. Still the it was quite entertaining anyway for a 25 episode series.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the anime because it was something fresh and new compared to the usual shounen animes with special powers and all. This anime was more realistic or closer to real life and the fights were spectacular.The comedy was also quite entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is a must see for shounen lovers and those who seek originality. This anime had a lot of potential. If it had lasted longer or if there was a second series it would definitely have done better in attracting viewers.As it was a bit rushed towards the end of the series, it was a bit hard to enjoy it towards the end, there is a possibility of a movie coming up and i will definitely look foward to it and any future development in this series.",

The characters where really like-able but as far as character development in the story, they didn't do such a great job. The art in the show is fairly good on par with shows like Zero no Tsukaima. The story is really good but can get complicated at times. I really enjoyed this anime and for me it reached my #1 anime pretty quick. I would also like to state thatthe show ends with an anime only ending that sucks, but that's only because the show covers only to chapter 104 in the manga and the manga itself has 357 chapters. One more thing I forgot to point out that the comedy in this show is dirty so if you don't like dick jokes and stuff like that than this probably won't be as enjoyable for you.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show to anyone who likes good comedy, music, and a good story.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to say thank you to those who took the time to read this review and I hope that it helped you in anyway possible.\\n\r\n:)",

            "content": "Story: 8/10 It\u2019s Progressive but the ending is a let down.\r\nWhen I started up the first episode of Air Gear I was pretty amazed by the opening scene, from the male protagonist looking over the horizon searching for new experiences to the following up\u2019s and down\u2019s within the opening scene\u2019s. The ability to over come his obstacles, seeking higher limits and soaring up to the expectations.\r\nI enjoyed the basis of the narrative that it was based on kids with motorized roller blades. I must say given the fact that this is based on roller blading, I was left beseeching for a second season. I canonly hope that FUNimation Entertainment is working on the next season.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animations themselves are very good even for a major fan base. Women are \u201cgifted\u201d as in other various anime\u2019s. The scenes where they are racing or battling has been put together very well adding new elements were you least expected it. The desire to own their shoes as they race from rooftop to rooftop is unimaginable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music really helps set the pace of the series, especially during the action sequences. The audio from the band Back-On with the song Chain goes very well with the opening theme as mentioned above\u2026\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe focus on character development is truly what makes the world of Air Treks enjoyable every character has his/hers aspirations, goals in life and they way in which they can achieve it is by using Air Treks to do so. As most fan based anime\u2019s some of the characters are pretty anime clich\u00e9 from the supporting character Onigiri who is a pervert and characterized as a pig inwhich he rides up side down on his head in which he is referred to as a upside down Buddha, without giving to much away.\\n\r\nThe understanding of the character archetypes/stereotypes  are easy to understand, Almost every character  in the series has their comical moments whether it's being perverted, goofy, or just \u2018out to get you\u2019\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall my main enjoyment came from the narrative based about roller blading, not to say there aren\u2019t other anime\u2019s based on racing such as rideback, but the understanding that there is a subgenre for skaters is quite cool if I may say so.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

            "content": "Last Year when I first heard of this AirGear show I was a little standoff-ish. Come on, here is a show about kids on friggin rollerblades. Then a few months ago I got this first edition from ADV and I gotta tell this show ROCKS! It's about KID'S ON FRIGGIN ROLLERBLADES!!! :P  \r\nIkki is a student with a grudge; on what I dont really know but it works for a story jumpoff. One day he gets his ass kicked and now wants to ride skates to cope with the pain. He lives with three girls who each own a pair of skates: Rika, Ringo,Mikan, and Shiraume &quot;Ume&quot; Noyamano who are apart of a cult group of people who skate around on Air Techs (AT's they call them). They call them Storm Riders. The show goes through little by little giving the details of the Storm Riders and the ranking system, but its pretty much that RollBounce movie + Tenjho Tenge with a dash of the Jet Grind Radio game from the SEGA Dreamcast days.\\n\\n\r\nIkki is pretty much  has a hidden talent for skating. Once he really gets into it he turns into Goku and no one can stop him...yet to be seen. He and his friends form their own band of Storm Riders and seeing as they both can't skate is gonna be a good fun time. \\n\\n\r\nAir Gear also has a manga edition to its name thats also pretty cool. It's not too close to the anime that its like going through the same darn thing over and over, but not to astray that you don't relate to anything. I'd say go ahead and read the mangas and watch it at the same time. Its not like Tenjho where the stories were way off from each other.\\n\\n\r\nI know Im pretty much having fun with this review but its either watch it or don't. It's REALLY worth a watch. Its got Girls, Action, Blood stuff,  Adult language for the kids, all types of stuff so just do it.  And I will find you and extract vengeance if you don't. Good ahead and enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nA-",

            "content": "Air Gear is a supertechnology and (almost) fantasy anime based off the first 103 chapters of the manga of the same name. Why it is called \"Air Gear\" however, I don't know, after all these engine driven roller blades that allow them to \"fly\" are called Air Treks (AT for short) in both the anime and the manga. But then again Air Gear simply fits better as a name, so then I guess it's okay.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story in Air Gear is pretty basic, yet it still manages to be so awesome at the same time. It starts with the lead Minami Itsuki (or Ikki for short)being introduced to the world of Ats, and it follows up with him learning about how an AT riding battler (aka Storm Rider), well, battles and obtains better pars for their own Ats in a \"tournament\" called \"Parts War.\" The story also shows him making his own Storm Rider team with his friends, and how they start climbing the ladder of Storm Riders, with the hopes of obtaining the title \"Sky King\".\\n\r\nLike I said the story is pretty basic, but it is executed and very well, however that wouldn't have been the case, hadn't it been for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere are several main characters in Air Gear (even though the site says it only is two), and they are all funny and likeable. There's the delinquent trio, with Ikki (who hates it when others stand out more than him) in the lead, and he's followed by Mikura Kazuma (or Kazu), who's their fastest runner, and Onigiri, a hilarious, fat pervert. Mihotoke Issha (Fats Buccha) and Wanijima Agito are both experienced at ATs before the show starts, and are introduced as opponents, but they are still important to the story, and are interesting characters. In addition there's one of the MANY girls who likes Ikki, Noyamano Ringo. They've known each other their entire lives, after all Ikki has always lived in the Noyamano house, with the Noyamano sisters Rika, Mikan, Ringo, and Ume, but only Ringo is a main character of these sisters. The sisters are also a part of their own AT team, the legendary \"Sleeping Forest,\" so even though Ringo wants to assist Ikki in his times of need, she can't.\\n\r\nThe main characters are all cool, but so is the supporting cast, from good guys like Simca (aka Swallow) to \"bad\" guys like Udou Akira (Behemoth), everyone is interesting, and the constant addition of new characters is acceptable only because of this. And while a few characters make you wonder why they were there in the first place, there's also Agito, who is ridiculously awesome.\\n\\n\r\nDesign:\\n\r\nThe design is pretty good. The animation is for the most part really good, and characters usually look great. There's of course the typical big eyes, weird hair colors, and spiky hair, but this is such a standard that it's hardly worth mentioning. Also for an ecchi anime, the womens breasts are surprisingly \"normal\" sized, and I mean normal as in \"not way too big, so it doesn't look stupid.\" Since it is ecchi there is of course \"zooming in on the female proportions\" and nudity, but the way the nudity is encensored is in a really hilarious and unique way, and it is actually a plus.\\n\r\nIn the Storm Rider battles the time is not only used to show people fighting, but there are also occasions when the action is paused for a \"symbolic picture.\" What I mean by that is that the different characters have something they \"symbolize,\" for instance Ikki's nickname is Crow, so often when he \"flies\" he is replaced with a flying crow. This is executed in many different forms and versions for pretty much every character who battles, and it looks really good, in addition to giving an identity of sorts, to the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is a mixed bag, it definitely isn't bad, but it didn't exactly blow my mind either. First off the music isn't all that good, it chose the right style, and the music style definitely fit along with the show, it's just that the songs chosen weren't at all that good, or even memorable. The only good, or even catchy, song in this anime is the intro, and it is sometimes succesfully used as an insert song.\\n\r\nThe sound effects on the other hand are really good, the different sounds that come when the characters hit each other, and the sound that comes from the Ats, it all sounds good and kinda realistic as well.\\n\r\nAnd then it's voice actors. Most of them, and maybe actually every one of them is a perfect choice for their characters, the ones who are supposed to sound reasonably stupid when the situation calls for it, and they sound awesome when they should. However sometimes I wasn't sure if I was completely satisfied with Ikki, Ringo, and Buccha, but for the most part they fit perfectly. Hell, even Agito's fits well, making him one of the few characters where I don't hate his female voice actor, and the only thing that makes me wish for a male one, is that I dislike the concept of women playing men itself. But over all they fit really well, and it really adds to the experience.\\n\\n\r\nTheme:\\n\r\nAs mentioned Air Gear is ecchi, but it manages to do it in way where it is only funny, and the ecchiness never gets in they way of the storytelling. Which brings me to the fact that this anime is absolutely hilarious, and it's not only th ecchi jokes that are funny, all the other jokes themselves are funny and enjoyable.\\n\r\nFriendship and love also have rather big parts in here, the characters fight for their friends, and you can tell that they enjoy being together. Love is less important in the action sequences, however it is much more mentioned though, and it assists in delivering some good jokes, but you don't really root that much for certain people to end up together, which is a bit of a shame.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show from beginning to end, it's funny, there's good voice acting, and the story was interesting enough for me to care. This is why I've seen the show several times, and the only time I was disappointed was the time I was reading the manga at the same time. That's because the manga just is a lot better, why? Well the anime has actually removed VERY much, and that sucks because the manga just was better with those scenes, and even fetured more characters.\\n\r\nSpeaking of the manga, the anime was as mentioned, only based off the first 103 chapters of the manga. This means that the anime ended with a cliffhanger, and not just any cliffhanger, it just ended suddenly. A battle ended and it was over, as if it was just another episode ending, but there never was an episode 26, and neither was there a sequel anime. This meaning that if you watch this be prepared for a sudden ending and to be disappointed with it, that is unless you read the manga. Therefore I only recommend this if you intend to read the manga as well, and you should also watch the anime before reading the manga. This is both to avoid being disappointed when you watch the anime, and to make positively surprised when you see everything new in the manga, it isn't that much new, but it is enough to make it superior. So, I definitely recommend this anime, but be prepared to read the manga as well, which I recommend even more.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\t\t8\\n\r\nCharacters:\t9\\n\r\nDesign:\t        9\\n\r\nSound:\t        9\\n\r\nTheme:\t        9\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\t9\\n\r\nOverall:\t        9",

            "content": "First of all, this review does not contain any sort of spoilers. So rest easy potential watchers. \r\nWhy do I love this anime? \r\nThe story isnt really original. As almost exspected from older shounen shows, the development in terms of plot of this show is quite predictable. The protagonist deals with any obstacle he cant overcome at once, just by training harder and \"believing\".\r\nYet it isnt boring at all. Why is that? \r\nYes, the plot isnt original but its executed oustandingly well. By emphasizing on shounen cliches and so elevating the show on a new level of \"over-the-topness\", Chung Jin Ho has created a storythat can not be beat in terms of overall enjoyment. The plot is flashy, the music is flashy, the animation is flashy. Air gear just screams flashy in all of its 25 episodes. Its one of those anime where you have to stop thinking in order to appreciate its greatness. Just like with Hellsing, you have to enjoy not analyse. Because you wont find no thought provoking symbolism nor will you find rationalism in Air gear. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I love about this anime are the characters. The protagonist, \"Ikki\", might be your  typical loudmouthed shounen male lead on the surface but his persona isnt that simple. He is cocky but humble, he is dense but caring. Overall he is a very likable character whose attitude  really is inspiring. Furthermore does he kick ass and doesnt take shit from no one. The rest of the cast is just as interesting as \"Ikki\" is. They all get their fair amount of screentime. However do most of them not experience any character development and the viewers dont get an insight in their motivations and true feelings. Character development and depth are essential parts of most anime but Air gear isnt most anime. When watching Air gear you wont miss those factors as your mind will be captivated by the action sequences, the funny interactions between the characters and the cool osts. \\n\\n\r\nAll things considered Air gear is a masterpiece in its own way. Its Tenjou Tenge done right. If you like action, a lighthearted story, actually well-timed fan-service and cool characters, you will not just like this anime but love it. I hope you will give it a shot. You wont regret it :)\\n\\n\r\nThis was my very first review. If you found it helpful, I would appreciate you showing so.",

I don't fucking know, and then I have a backlog of shit anyway and stuff I like that comes out every week I can barely follow, I never finished attack on titan or even watched kill la kill and I don't know whether I should or just keep following the more obscure/moe shit I like, no one talks about hunter x hunter 2011 despite it being the second best shonen behind yu yu hakuswag and I'm not even sure fans of the manga even like it because the atmosphere of it is too bright or some fucking garbage \". So yeah, air gear is good, but don't watch the anime, read the manga, because if you like the anime you will have to read the manga, which you might not be able to do after watching the anime, shit is fucked.",

            "content": "\"Air Trek... huh.\"\r\nIt may be a bit lame to open a review with a quote from the series, I've seen plenty of reviews that have been opened like that. Though I have to admit I'm absolutely terrible in starting and finishing stuff like letters, emails and report, but in this case this particular quote just popped to mind when thinking about Air Gear.\r\nNow before actually starting to review I probably have to admit that for some reason I enjoyed Air Gear a lot, probably more than I should have. But before you decide to stop reading this won't be a glorified \"omg this anime roxxxits da best\" fanboy review, I do have a brain and I realise that my liking of this anime does not make it a good anime on its own. In fact I realise that this anime is probably not even that good.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I gave it a 7 in this review (2 points lower than I gave it in my personal list) is because although for me personally it felt like a brilliant anime, when I look at it unbiased I realise the fundemental flaws in there that may disturb others when watching. As I said before, I still don't really know why but this anime has stolen a spot in my top all time for no appearent reason, and I highly doubt it will do so for anyone else.\\n\\n\r\nThe fundemental flaws with Air Gear are its chaotic story, which seems to progress illogically and at times even completely unreasonably, it seems to want to try really hard to be comical and serious at the same time. In the manga the story makes a lot more sense and after reading it I noticed a lot of minor and major parts were cut out which only increase in the instability of the story in the anime. It's so severe that even the way ikki gets his air-trek is considerably different, which acts like a butterfly effect causing major issues later on which really degrade the quality of the story.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the issues stated above, lots of the character development seems just as chaotic and surreal making it hard to actually feel connected to the characters and their wishes. Not to mention the fact that only a very few of the characters actually get any meaningful existence in the anime. Most of them are just there to pose as challenges to overcome or as generic friends that need saving.\\n\\n\r\nI find that most of these quality issues went past me when watching the anime, I found it highly enjoyable to watch as it's still comical and I still managed to actually understand and get a feel of the story. I do however consider myself to probably be an exception. In fact, I hardly ever read manga's, and after watching the anime I just HAD to read the manga because I couldn't resist not having any more air gear.\\n\\n\r\nBut the manga misses something amazing that the anime does have, the sound. Anime makes a story alive by giving a manga colour and motion, but in a lot of cases the sound makes the feeling complete. In Air Gear this is taken to an extreme and it feels like a lot of the atmosphere is carried by the music and sound. It would probably be a worthless piece of dung even to me if the anime didn't have this good of a soundtrack. In fact, I'm sure that there are plenty of people that will dislike the soundtrack (that's what human taste does, one person's trash is another's treasure) and for those people this anime probably will be torture to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I wouldn't recommend watching this if you're out to find a meaningful and fulfilling anime. But if you want to watch something you can laugh at but still has its (or at least attempts to have) slightly meaningful \"battles\" and comfrontations then Air Gear is something you might enjoy. Might. I will not guarantee it.\\n\r\nMaybe thats why I enjoyed it so much, the fact that its trying to be comical and serious and even attempts to throw in some twisted forms of romance and morality. To me it seems like the feeling Air Gear gives off is unique and works for me, but I realise that to most people it simply won't.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, it will either turn out to be hillarious for you or you'll be annoyed at how strange Air Gear is. Only one way to find out.",

            "content": "\"The Sky's the Limit\" \r\nThis is a frequently used quote, notable in literature. One can take it literally as in the sky is as far as we can go. Or metaphorically meaning the sky has endless possibilities.  Lets go with metaphorically! The sky is the limit, it holds the endless list of dreams one wishes. Why am I telling you about a quote rather than the anime? Well the sky is the limit, right? Not in the wold of Air Gear it is, one can go beyond the skies in order to reach their dream.\r\n*THIS IS A REVIEW AND CONTAINS SPOILERS. READ AT YOUROWN CAUTION, RECOMMENDED TO READ AFTER YOU WATCH THE ANIME*\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nSimply imagine a world where your aloud to touch the vast sky,  practically soar through the heavens, and feel the wind in your hair as you race across open air! All this is possible in the world of Air Gear. The world of Air Gear uses the invention of the Air Treks (A-T's). Air trek's are basically advanced roller blades allowing the user to race through the streets, buildings, and the air with amazing speeds and  ease! No matter how big or small you may be, when these people put on their Air Gear, they feel as swift as bird flying through the sky. \\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around a young teen named Itsuki Minami or easier said \"Ikki\". Ikki has loves the sky ever since he was young, Once Ikki finds out about the Air Gear world, he is hooked on them.  This new fad of 'Air Treks' swept the nation's youth and all over gangs are being formed that compete in various events, tournaments or races using their A-T's .  Ikki forms his own team,Kogarasumaru, with the help of some friends and they start to compete in these events.  There is a special ranking system in the world of Air Gear, and the highest rank skaters are know as Sky Kings. Ikki's team wants to be the number 1 team out there. Even Ikki wants and has the potential to be a Sky King.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art in Air Gear is overall well done and drawn well. The art has great detail and the action scene art is especially great. It's not super beautiful art, but it has a more rustic, cool look to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe opening and ending of Air Gear are truly great. It fits this  genre perfectly with some nice rock and roll beats. Even the sound effects and background music fit nicely with the appropriate scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8 \\n\r\nEach character is unique in what kind of Air Trek they use and each have their own different goals. Overall all the character are nicely developed and have unique characteristics that stick with them and make it good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor is great if your a person who enjoys some cool actions and racing scenes. These aren't any ordinary, boring race scenes, there are complex race tracks many times with obstacles! Plus this new concept of Air Treks have never been seen before, so it's a unique twist on its own.  The whole idea of Air Treks and tournaments, races, and events that teams compete in, is very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5 - 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime and the plot is original. I'm sad that it only has 25 episodes, it would have been a great anime to continue. This anime teaches an important lesson, that to always reach for the sky because the sky, like our dreams, has endless possibilities. \\n\\n\r\n\"Look at the sky, it\u2019s so far away. But right here, right now it seems so close.\"\\n\r\n ~Air Gear\\n\r\nLesson learned: Your dreams may be closer than you think, just never give up on them.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review also covers  the manga\r\nOh great, another anime  from Oh  Great. It suffered the same fate as its predecessor Tenjou tenge,  cancelled after its first season.  Why is it?\r\nMaybe because  it's robbed  of  its best quality.  Ogure's  great art.  why  on earth a production house dared to  produce  an adaption of Ogure's manga with such inferior  animation. Maybe  because of the failure  of Tenjou tenge anime, Toei  choosed to play it safe and provide a low budget for this anime. This of course backfired. \r\nAnother temptingexplaination is that while  that 14 year old could buy and read air gear in secret, it's hard  for them  to watch the anime except  if he has a tv in his room . Thus it's  difficult for air gear to reach its audience. There is also the censor of the no no parts,so that it is not rated as a softcore porn. \\n\r\nAs i mentioned before the above mentioned  analysis is tempting,  but this overlook the fact that adult like watching animated series.  For example.In united states   adults love watching   south park,  The simpson , faimily  guy.  The simpson even has been aired for more than a decade. But on one hand These  cartoon of  course are aimed at adult,the story is about  how american dealing with problem that ordinary american faced in their real life.  Or it cleverly make fun of the society.  Hey Conan O'brien who graduarted from Harvard used to write the script for the simpson.    on the other hand  air gear is about teenagers, despite of the violence and  the dark description of human.   The characters  think, act and deal with the usual problem of teenagers like love, the lost of role  model,  friendship , and of corse brawn is the best while brain is almost useless.\\n\r\n  All of sudden Sora ,who is jobless  and never work in his entire life and whose girlfriend  has to work as a low paid job wrestler, has an access to jet plane, gigantic robot and high tech  stuff. I think it would be more appealing to older  audiences if  there was clever explaination of this.\\n\r\nThere is a missmatch because  the author wanted the story to be complex, but the   characters are still silly, lovey dovey teenager. \\n\r\nBoobs are not a substitute for a good storytelling.  Ogure's works are too complex for young teens and  overly simple for young adults. \\n\r\n,In my  personal opinion  there is  a dilemma  in producing Ogure's work  ,\\n",

            "content": "So I never watched this because its one of those animes where you love it or hate it, and I can see why.\r\nFor starters lets talk about the story, its good dont get me wrong, but ive read the manga, and it could of been better. That aside how they presented it, I mean its kind of different from animes like Naruto, or an anime where the op is omnipatant in a sense, where its like one guy can posses skill, and yes he has the power to be the king, but everyone before, and after him are just as suitable as him, its justhis willpower/friendship/life really pushes him past everyone else. But the anime ends on episode 25 so yeah that sucks, and there will probably never be a season two.\\n\r\n--- Story 7/10, just left me hanging, but its not anyones fault really, things like this happen.\\n\\n\r\nArt, omg I hate this art style, but it fits this show perfectly, rollerblading kids wouldn't look good if it had a very smooth art style, just imagine this show having these smooth characters, the air treck animations would just look stupid.\\n\r\n--- Art 9/10, I may not like it, but the show wouldnt have caught me if it didnt use this style of animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound, sorry idc about sound, lets talk about characters. I like the op, the typical hey im what appears to be a idiot, but im actually super hard working and motivated guy. His friends are also pretty interesting considering they kind of stand out more to me then the op himself, honestly idk if its just me, but I really noticed Itsuki Minami's friends more then I did him.\\n\r\n--- Characters 9/10, eh they some cool dudes, I dont think you can really hate any of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall hey it was a cool ride, its just so intresting how this anime doesnt seem popular with others, to each there own. But would I recommend this to everyone reading this, well YES, although it may be unfinished art, its art, and if I could get one person to watch Air Gear, well then that would be pretty cool, because it has potential, and I think it is really inspiring, and I cherish brief shows like this, more then long term shows that just are like here is what were giving you, now you know everything, about this universe.",

            "content": "First review I've ever done, but (O-O)9 fightooo\r\nLe Mizu began watching this anime after two years from finishing the manga, which gives a gap long enough to forget the story details and enjoy it throughly again.\r\nStory 10\r\nI will give the story a 10 because I know how this story ends, and it is not the kind of bad and boring ending back to the beginning like the manga of Hitman Reborn (I really felt like crying because the ending was so bad). Air Gear is appropiate for anyone who likes the genres that it includes, tho the manga contains a little more ecchi than whatthe anime does (since some parts are already censored). Anyone who enjoyed the anime and wants more, should go and check the manga, I really recommend it\\n\\n\r\nArt 6\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, it is not as if I didn't like how they made the characters look, but its more about how many fails the anime has in its drawings (I might even draw better than them in some specific seconds of the chapters). Sometimes Ringo's hair is in the wrong location, or the eyes are too far from each other, or maybe they lost the body proportion, so it actually mess ups the wonderful feeling that I had from the manga.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6\\n\r\nI think there is excess of background music, or they switch it too fast with each scene, also between the small \"break\" of each 13 minutes, the music is too long and it becomes tiring by skipping it so many times (tho the drawings in there are actually pretty... sometimes)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9\\n\r\nEach character has their own story, perosnality, motivation, and its amazing how they were all so well-developed with the huge amount of characters this anime has. It reminds me a lot to the Durarara cast/characters for the amount.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nIts been a long time since I felt the need to RUN throught each chapter and finish this anime as soon as possible (*raises hand* I'm sorry for pushing my final homework to 2 hours before the due date), so you can guess how fun this is to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI think everyone should give a chance to the anime, and if you find it not that bad, you should ABSOLUTELY try the manga. I really recommend it to any gender and any age, and it also has a pretty deep (but easy to see) meaning to the whole story, lifts my spirits up :3",

The series is very funny and has a lot of action. The story was pretty good they stopped the series at a good spot but it shows you that really the story has just started. I wish they came out with a second season starting right off where they left off here. The art was fantastic i loved the color and the teams stickers. The sound I give a perfect 10 I never really watchedthe show ending credits besides Naruto when he was fighting Lee's team. Love the song Sky 2 High. The characters were excellent going to start reading the manga to read more about them they did do a good description of everyone but I want to learn more. I enjoyed the show very much laughing at the times when they got into fights and his sisters kicking his ass. Overall I really enjoyed the series it skipped over all the other series I\"m watching and I was able to finish it in a week.",

            "content": "The story line is pretty basic, bad boy finds a sport he gets into and actually is really good at it. It\u2019s so basic that I can just tell that everything will come out alright and it would surprise me if it wasn\u2019t. Frankly, I don\u2019t know if I really want to watch too much of it even if it\u2019s only 25 shows. I never really got into any type of sports shows and this one doesn\u2019t really change my mind. I may only watch it to one of my favorite characters shows up but that\u2019s it.\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty nicely done; it\u2019s normally hard to say anything bad for something done in the age of computer animation now although it does happen. There are a couple things that make this look a little tacky though. The extra 3D animation that is sometimes put in. Its fine when they are going tech on us about the diagrams but when they use it for the world and some of the air tricks like using a tank and stuff, it\u2019s really bothersome. Also when they go realistic on some things like food, it just takes away from the show. There is a hell of a lot of fan service as well, especially when there are a ton of girls in this. Just counting Ikki\u2019s family, there are 4 and then you count all the other girls\u2026 Now unlike in the show, the ending live animation is pretty good in a sense, though with how shaky it is, it feels a bit like FLCL\u2019s, only luckily without the odd cutting.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is just ok, not really the best but feels like normal slice of life style, even when it gets into air treks and it feels kind of sad that happens. I would have really liked a bit more upbeat then what\u2019s there. The opening sounds a lot like Bleach which throws me off a bit. The English voices are alright, though I\u2019m really not sure about some of the voices. It\u2019s just odd, though luckily, most of the main cast is actually pretty good. No one really wants me to scratch my ears out and the only one that I have trouble with is Hillary Haag who plays Shiraume Nayamano, also known as Ume, and I think its because she has had her voice in a lot of other shows and I hear more of the other characters rather then Ume\u2019s own voice. Chris Patton is a perfect Ikki though and somewhat makes up for Hillary\u2019s voice, since he is the main character. Chris is good with the bad boys pretty much and has a pretty good cross between funny and bad ass. \\n",

Occasional fan-service but in-depth battle gives this series a large diversity for development as you can do just about anything in this anime.\r\nAlthough the series only portrays about 1/5 of the actual storyline, this title has definitely made its mark in the genre of sports anime in its time especially. What more could captivate the audience with a new sport, hot girls and more importantly, a single dream that bests all others.\r\nCharacter development is slow in this anime as it focuses primarily ona few of the main characters, leaving the side and potentially noteworthy characters on the side. One would say adding more characters would increase depth in a story but in this anime, it would only be redundant as a majority of the new characters get thrown in a corner after about 2 or 3 episodes of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a highly enjoyable anime in ITS TIME. Present day, many other titles precede this series and ultimately makes this series a thing of the past. However, I highly recommend watching it if you're looking for something new and out of the mainstream flow of events shown by present day sports-based anime.",

            "content": "\"The law of skaters is hard, but it is the law\"- Some idiot who came up with the rules for this sport, probably.\r\nAt first, I dropped this anime around episode 8 because of the copious amount of ecchi and the over-seriousness of the sport, but looking back on it, I'm glad I finished it. \r\nStory: welcome to the world of Ikki, a guy who just learned how to skate a few seconds ago, yet is already popular enough to have the attention of the hottest girl in the litter (heard this story before? Me too). This guy has an ego the size of his overgrownhair and flies on Friendship and SuperpowersTM. This is Air Gear, a sports anime like any other and certainly not on the top of the list. \\n\r\nYet, despite all this, it's a pretty entertaining show, why? Let's find out!\\n\\n\r\nThe good:\\n\r\nAir gear has a nice mix of humor thrown throughout the story; each character having its own brand of comedy. Most jokes won't make you roll over laughing, but it certainly got a snigger out of me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters/ designs:\\n\r\nThe characters are as diverse as they are plentiful. Designs like these make me hopeful that one day, all anime will be this diverse. There are black characters, white characters, tanned characters in all sizes from XS to XXL (something you rarely see in today's shows, where everyone is a stick puppet - while sometimes simultaneously having massive breasts that should realistically bring harm to the body; yes, even the breasts in this anime are somewhat realistic).\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of personality, they all have their own clear-cut stereotype, yet they are not afraid to sometimes go beyond it (though sometimes to such an extent that it feels more like personality swapping- I'm looking at you, Ikki). \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are also very interesting and get a decent amount of back-story most of the time. This is a contradiction to our shounen-hero Ikki who barely gets any back-story at all- in the beginning it's hard to guess what Ikki's living-situation actually is (I'm still not sure).\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe mediocre:\\n\r\nAnimation: Looking up close, the animation doesn't look too good- verging on awful sometimes. However, the colors are appealing and the designs are fun and diverse; it's easy to distinguish the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OP really fits the theme of the show with its upbeat hip-hop sound. The ending however, isn't all that exciting.\\n\r\nThe ost for this show, though nice and upbeat, gets repetitive after a while.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad:\\n\r\nPacing: Our main character literally flies through the story at an alarming pace. There are barely any setbacks (and if there are, they will quickly be swept away by either the help of a Sudden Ally or the Power Of Friendship/ wind).\\n\r\nIt goes surprisingly easy for him (even with his natural talent for riding the wind), and during battles, the enemy seems to have more at stake than him.\\n\\n\r\nPacing to me is almost paramount, it shows how realistic the scenarios are and what a person can achieve in the time they are given. Alas, this anime doesn't do too well in this department.  \\n\\n\r\nTaking things too serious: How can taking something too serious be bad, you ask? Well, the feel of the show has to align with the story and the sport somewhat and the antagonists of this show are bringing a gun to a knife fight. Death is a constant threat and if not, serious charges and possible arrest -by a faction who thinks the ends justify the means- looms over the head of every skater. \\n\\n\r\nAdd that up to the mysterious superpowers that are on the same scale as Kuroko no Basket (and sometimes even more ridiculous), and you have a show that makes you feel like you missed the clue. Did they drop in a fantasy world where all this is totally acceptable? Is this all a dream thought up by our shounen protagonist? Who knows, these things are never explained in any case.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it? Well it depends; if you can sit back and relax without over-thinking too much, I'd say go for it. Are you an ecchi enthusiast? Well sure, just do it (though it does tone down after the first few episodes).\\n\\n\r\nBut if you like your anime a little bit more clear-cut and realistic, I'd say skip this one. There are better fish in the sports anime sea.",

But ,after i watched it , it's just a fanservice shonen packaged in \"dramatical\" quotes .\r\nStory : First of all , it's creative at all . Even though It's just a mixture and repetition of all the shonen anime with theme such as love , friendship , fun things , \"girls\" , courage-ness , craziness andall classic shonen things .\\n\\n\r\nDialogue(script) &amp; vocalizing : Nothing really a thing . But , the words are somewhat good-for-ear and cool . Especially , the word came from the blue head one :\\n\r\n&quot;Fuck!&quot;\\n\r\n- Agito Wanijima -\\n\r\nsimply cool(and loveable)\\n\\n\r\nSound : Match the anime . My favourite part of the series . The soundtracks are street style and match the anime perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : Nice development . But , some of the character has weak development .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\nI never really enjoy this anime , somewhat the fanservice is really really annoying . But , it's not as cliche as other animes have done ,it was really funny in one point but also annoying in other points.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\r\nAir Gear is a mixture of classic shonen anime factors plus street style profanity and what-boys-like fanservices .\\n",

But there is one thing i have to pick on is if your going to watch and hope there is a deep romance element, your going to be disappointed.

            "content": "This is my first time to write a review, so please be tolerant^^\r\nStory:\r\nSo, Air Gear have one of the most unique storylines ever made. This is not typical sport, but something like tuned up rollerblades. It's a shounen anime, but the main characters are not godlike to win every battle. You will never be sure who will finally win (as long as you didn't read the manga first). And well, there's a bit of romance here (especially in the special trick there is a really cute romance part).\r\nArt:\r\nWell, it's almost the same as in manga. Really great. Some scenes looks like a colored manga pictureswhich looks really great. Well, the reason I can't give it 10 is because the way they've animated the tricks. It was one of the most important things in manga and they spoiled it in anime. At least, it could've been done better.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nPersonally, I love the opening and ending theme. The background music is not so great but I find it one of the most unique soundtracks I've ever heard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWell, there were no character that I didn't like. And charaters like Agito/Akito, Ringo or Simca are someone I will never forget. So, 10 for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDespite how they've animated the tricks, it's still really enjoyable. The OP theme and sountrack are really catchy, story is interesting and everyone cand find a charater to like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI give it 8. -1 point for the animation of tricks, and -1 point for the soundtrack, which is not bad at all, but still I'd really like to hear here more rock sounds or some eurobeat would be great idea.",

            "content": "This show is about making motorized roller skating as convoluted and idiotic as possible. Groups of kids fly around and either do bullshit nonsense races, or beat each other up with imaginary skate magic. The purpose is to climb a fake tower that doesn't actually exist. They all talk about it like it's real, but it's not. It's just some ranking ELO system that I guess they always input off-screen. Apparently the main character can see air and skate on it, because everyone in the show says he can. And he was destined to be the greatest skater ever, because everyone in the show sayshe is. This is never explained farther than people randomly saying it.\\n\\n\r\nThe writer clearly forgets about characters constantly, only to remember they exist and put them back in the show several episodes later. The show runs out of budget at the end, and resorts to creating backgrounds by taking real life pictures, putting a grainy filter over it, and then animating the characters over it.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is HOT fire, especially for a 2006 anime. It's actually the only reason to watch it.",

And constantly talking about flying! The main character is typical loud mouth protagonist and if you don\u2019t like him then that\u2019s totally understandable. The good characters are the supporting cast who get to develop along with the protagonist and support him even though he won\u2019t shut the f#ck up about flying like a biscuit if you throw it. I know most people are put off because the show is about roller blading but it\u2019s closer to putting onboots that allow you to defy physics. Once I got past the bit about the roller blading its surprisingly the fan service that put me off. Don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m all about seeing the bingbongabongos on a girl, but it was so out of place in this show I wish they just didn\u2019t do it. So if you can look past the premise and the main character who loves to soar through the sky like a rock if you throw it, then you will find a diamond of a show.",

But, I was hooked by episode 3. \r\nI am reminded a lot of Accel World while watching this. The loser that is to be the king. I wish a second season had been released. \r\nThe art style is from the 2000s, but it sometimes feels like the '80s. The way the characters move reminds me of roller skaters from the '70s and '80s, and it's thoroughly enjoyable. \r\nThe music is awesome. Once again, '70s to '80s music,and it fits the feel of the Anime perfectly.\\n\r\nThe characters take a little time to develop, but it's worth it in the end. \\n\r\nThe story is amazing, and I haven't really seen a sports Anime come close to this one.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint: The ecchi. If you're gonna have an anime be ecchi, don't cover up every little thing! That makes it less enjoyable!

            "content": "Air Gear is very much a product of anime culture. It's definitely a \"tweener\" anime, much in line with many of the most popular shows in the industry, like Attack on Titan and Sword Art Online. The plot is phenomenally generic and can be vague and meandering, there's a helping of T&A large enough to pique the curiosity of the same target audience, and the aesthetic appeal of the anime will likely draw as many viewers as the plot synopsis. \r\nAnd yet, my rating stands as a perfecty decent 6. Why, exactly? It's all the things that a more discerning viewer has learned to avoid.And yet, like a lesser version of No Game No Life, this overblown, generic teenage fever dream has so much heart. It's a show that screams \"efforts have been made\". And even if it falls on its face in terms of narrative and plot, the characters that make up that plot elevate what should be just another lame trashy pseudo-ecchi into a perfectly decent character exposition.\\n\\n\r\nLet me explain, because not everyone who has seen this show already is going to agree with that statement. Make no mistake, the drama in this show is overblown, silly, and downright cringeworthy at times. However, this is a teenage story in every sense, and because it's being told mainly from the perspectives of Ikki and, to a lesser extent, Ringo, it actually works, because we're seeing the world through the eyes of teenagers trying to find their place in their own little subculture. With that context, what would be better served as a happy-go-lucky romp ends up working as a story by teens for teens, even though that isn't exactly true. Either way, the characters mostly have great chemistry, and their relationships play out in generally meaningful and believable ways. Every character in this show has flaws, and those flaws are explored meaningfully.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's the music. Heavily reminiscent of the late-90s, early-2000s alternative scenes, sans the nu metal scene. With the subject material in mind, it works, and it works really, REALLY well. Remember Jet Set Radio for the Sega Genesis? Yeah, it's like that. It recycles a lot of musical motifs, but does a good job of changing styles enough to enhance the mood, which is paramount when telling such an emotionally-wrought tale from such flawed perspectives. One of the few soundtracks I've taken upon myself to acquire for my personal music collection.\\n\\n\r\nIs it an objectively good show? No. It has a lot of heart, oozes potential, and it certainly has its moments, but it's not objectively a 6 out of 10. That rating can only come from watching it from the perspective of a bystanding character in the show, or as Ikki himself. You have to be a teenager to enjoy the show, however you may get to that state of mind. Once you're there, it's more than the 6 out of 10 that I gave it, because it weighs as much as it thinks it does.",

Now sports animes are normally the ones at the bottom of my priorities (not out of spite, just not much of a sports junkie) but after stumbling upon this, i think ill have to reevaluate my perception on the genre (im now watching big windup) lol\r\nI believe the first i heard of this was with my college roomate. He told me about an anime with motorized skates that allow you to scale buildings. At first my GTFO attitude was about to kick in but i was curious enough to give it a watch. And i must say it wasnothing short of a blast\\n\\n\r\nIt tells the tale of our hero Itsuki Minami aka Ikki/Babyface, leader of the East Side Gunz gang and who was thrust into the world of Air Trek or ATs for short. His interest grows with each challenge and trick that he decides to form his own team of StormRiders with friends Kazu, Onigiri, and later on fellow Riders Fats Buccha and Agito/Akito \\n\\n\r\nThe whole story is focused on the teams growth and rise through the ranks of ATs while trying their best to find their place in the sky. The characters can be a little stereotypical but through and through they all manage to hold up as individuals with their own set of issues. I especially was drawn into Agito and Kazu's stories because they just seemed to be the most interesting to me. I wont spoil it for those who havent seen it but just know its gonna get good lol.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is where things get a little hard. Its mainly a hit and miss. The music is unlike most of what ive heard in anime but sometimes it portrays the wrong kinda music for the wrong kinda scene. Its nothing awe inspiring but when it wants to be good, it will sure as hell do its job. Couldve been better though\\n\\n\r\nOverall, its a nice little title to watch in spare time. There are certainly better titles out there to check out but at the same time, you just cant beat good popcorn entertainment. If you dont mind some corny dialogue, simple animation, and a good amount of profanity (courtesy of Agito), then strap on your blades and hold on for the ride known as Air Gear",

At first one would  think that this was another sport anime whose story revolves around competitions and tournaments. But you only guessed a portion right.\r\nThe \"motorized wheeled footgear\" used in this series is called Air Trek. Normal people would use it as a form of transportation. But the VIPs use it for, yeah you got it right, showing off! And everyone thinks they're pretty cool.\r\nLet us point the spotlight to the main character Ikki. Note that I am doing this review based on the anime ONLYfor i haven't read the manga. The main character reminds me of Sena Kobayakawa, Ippo Makunochi, and all the characters that are demonstrated to be GENIUS on a foreign field. This character development will kind of accelerate your urge to watch him beat the crap out of the weak guys who underestimates. Haha\\n\\n\r\nThe element of secrecy presented in the Sleeping Forest team is a good idea. It makes you want to find out and continue to watch more. However, this proves to be counter productive sometimes. It spoils the the excitement as to you know already who and what to expect in the final battle.\\n\\n\r\nThe emergement of the genesis is a major unexpected event in the series. One that really got me hook up for quite some time. The only thing that bothered me is the fact that SO MANY PEOPLE are actually taking this air trek thing VERY SERIOUSLY. And by serious i mean having oneself subject to another. This sudden addition of event makes me think that the entire AIR TREK universe isn't perfectly defined. One thing that will prove my claim is the existence of regalias. All the while I thought that the crazy tricks, some of which doesn't conform to the laws of physics, are just exaggerations. But with the advent of the regalias, those out-of-these-world \"parts\" that could practically make you a superhuman-wearing-AT, my whole notion of a perfectly normal universe crumbled to pieces.\\n\\n\r\nThe tropaeum, or whatever that is, is something that you yourself should find out, for I don't have a clear picture of it in my mind. Meaning, it was as vague as it can get, at least for me. Maybe it has something to do with the unfinished storyline in the anime. Maybe one would understand if the manga is read alongside it. I can't say for sure.\\n\\n\r\nWith everything said, did i just make myself clear that there is more to it than meets the eye? Try watching it and you may find out other things not mentioned here, things that are cleverly put to keep yourself fixated on it for an indefinite amount of time.",

So I kept watching and after episode 8 it just kept getting better. Air Gear became my favorite anime in a very short time. It had everything an anime could wish for: a great storyline, characters one could look up to, action, emotions, the sign of never giving up on your dreams. The best part was... Never looking back, always going forward, don't dwell on the past when the future is right infront of you. Don't say the sky is too high for you. With the help of your friends and your own wings, you'll fly in that sky if you never give up.\\n\\n\r\nAir Gear still is my favorite anime and it always will be, there's nothing that can top it in my mind. The manga is great as well. I wish that they would keep making the Air Gear anime for I as one of many loved it. I still love it and I rewatch it every now and then. It still makes me smile, it simply is the best in my heart. Air Gear's storyline is basically about a boy who finds his dreams with the help of his friends. He meets new people along the way and learns the truth of never giving up. If you haven't watched Air Gear, I highly recommend it. If you're a fan of anime, you'll truly fall in love with the storyline. Well, that's all I wanted to say in this review, so keep up the great work. And if you happen to read this - Oh! Great! -,  maybe keep up the anime some day? I'm glad you're still keeping up the manga, it's great beyond words.\\n\\n\r\nOkay.. . Now, that's all.",

            "content": "First before I start with this review, i want to say I was very hesitant when I heard this was an anime that, like many others, was distanced from that of the manga. With that in mind, as well as having read the manga, I think that this is a great series even with a limited amount of episodes. If you do want to know the whole story, I'd recommend watching the anime first, then reading the manga.\r\nNow then, here's the outline for my review:\r\nSTORY - So Air Gear is pretty simple when it comes to the story. You have the main character Itsuki Minami,or Ikki, who starts out as a rookie to Air Treks, but is fascinated by the sight of them and wants to become an AT master. Later on in the story, he  creates his own team to compete in \"parts wars\" with other AT gangs. The anime story distances itself off just a tad bit from the manga during the course of it, and that is to be expected when there is only so many episodes. It's better to have some unanswered stuff and action than thorough explanation and almost no action. Simple structure, but it gets pretty deep. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nART - Air Gear has some damn good art. Being the anime that it is, it comes to no surprise that there are thousands upon thousands of people who are huge fans of the art in Air Gear. I'm a sucker for a couple of cool looking things, but usually it isn't the art or animation that tends to win me over, and Air Gear definitely does a good job with it. It's really close to a 10 for me, but i'd say it deserves a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - This is definitely where I get the most out of this anime. The tracks and songs are spectacular. The best part is that most fight scenes have their own unique track as well (not all, but a few).  Honestly, if it weren't for both the beautiful animations and great sound, I might have dropped this anime a while down the road. Personally, You can give me any terrible anime with zero plot, but if it has a kick-ass playlist, I will watch every last minute of it. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Alright, so for the I have a mixed opinion of the characters. The anime doesn't explain every (main) character in too much detail, but that is just something to be expected from an adaption of a 300+ chapter manga. With this in mind, the anime had a lot to improve upon when it comes to in depth character analysis. \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with one of my favorites: Agito/Akito. The concept of these two personalities in one body seems interesting of course, but it never was truly answered in the anime I feel. Again, there is better character analysis in the manga. For the most part, i'd say this anime has interesting characters with different backgrounds, but not good enough analysis to understand why this character matters, or why this character does this or that. 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - Air Gear is a really fascinating anime, and almost every episode left me with the enjoyment that I was looking for. The enjoyment only started ending around the last episodes because of some unanswered stuff. Still, there are some great action scenes and interesting story details and almost no filler episodes, which is something I value a lot when it comes to any action anime. I'm glad it had 25 interesting episodes instead of 40 filler episodes out of 100 episodes. 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - I REALLY want to give this anime a higher rating than what I am giving it since I know the full story, but after I finished the anime in the first place, it felt empty. *NOTE: After this point, there will be spoilers. You have been warned.* \\n\\n\r\n(SPOILERS) I honestly thought the ending was rather incomplete and had no answer to what we all really wanted, which was Ikki becoming the sky king. And then what about Genesis? He intended to bring war to them, and the OVA/special kind of answers it, but I want the answer in the actual anime, not more fillers after the series is done. It was really disappointing to me since I realized I had to read through the hundred something chapters to figure out my answer. It's more of an \"oh well\" then a \"wow that was awful\" sort of thing. (/SPOILERS)\\n\\n\r\n*No more spoilers.* Lastly, I will keep on saying this, but this anime is great, I enjoyed it thoroughly, it could have been better, but if you like action anime along with a good story, definitely give Air Gear a shot. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE - 8.5",

            "content": "First of all I'm writing this review knowing you'll most likely not like this show nearly as much as I do and thats fine. I'm just displaying my opinion of one of my favorite shows, so take what I'm saying with openness.\r\nCharacters: I would have to say the characters of Air Gear is one of the best parts about the show. Most of the characters have hilarious interactions with each other and have something in each of their personalities you will like. Even though most of the characters retain a very eccentric personality they can become very serious at times and make the whole atmosphereof the show become \"comfortably\" intense if that makes any sense. These scenes display their character very well and overall make Air gear a stronger show. \\n\\n\r\nStory: The story was honestly a pleasant surprise I read the synopsys and was thinking \"really, roller blade gangs\"? However soon I'm like 6 or less episodes in, I'm pleasantly surprised with how interesting the story really is. You get really involved wanting to find out about the world of Air Treks and how the characters will handle this new world they chose.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Nothin too special here, art style was pretty average at the time, just did what it needed to do. Fanservice in this show I want to say was very appearant even having some uncensored nudity time to time however I never felt Air Gear relied on fanservice to keep the viewer 's interest and to be honest it made some scenes even more enjoyable. I feel the fanservice in this show was handled very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Action: This is were we get into what made Air Gear an unforgettable experience for me. The soundtrack in this show was top notch, from the nice up-beat techno, to the calm instrumentals, and even to the goofy \"Body song\", my ears were delighted. However when you put the amazing music with the hype, intense AT battles you get a feeling only Air Gear can give. The music coinciding with the visuals made this show.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Actors: I HIGHLY reccomend you watch this series in dub, how human the actors makes these characters feel is top notch, as well as having hilarious dialogue. Furthermore the english actors just sound like they're having so much fun, which in turn made me enjoy watching the show even more. Favorite dub to date.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nAir Gear I find to probably be my favorite anime right now, the pure enjoyment I get from this show is unparalled. From the amazing music coinciding with the awesome action scenes to the hilarious dialouge, I can't help but love this show. I do not think this show is for everyone but if you have a high tolerance for fanservice, not the most serious plot ever and  raunchy humour, give it a try it! :)\\n\\n\\n\r\nWARNING!!: Ending will have you infuriated if you enjoy it",

There are still no plans to do any more seasons in 2014.\r\nThe reason why you shouldn't watch it is because the anime is pretty awesome. It's not going to change the way you see life, it's not going to make you say \"it's my favorite anime of all time\" but you will enjoy it, it will grow on you episode after episode, andjust when you're getting into it, it ends, with no closure, nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not immense but it's pretty decent, a guy wants to be the greatest air trek rider in the universe, and the first season is just a build up to see what you should expect, get to know the characters, and take a sneak peek at the awesome rivals he will have to face in the future... a future only available in manga sadly.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great, the art is good, the concept is relatively unique, and overall it's a very, very solid anime that could easily be one of my favorites if it was completed, and it will definitely leave you wanting for more.\\n\\n\r\nViewer discretion is advised, strong fanservice components such as light ecchi.

But someday Ikki stumbles across these rolllerblades or in the anime air trecksand an emblem that says sleeping forest on it that he all found in his sisters room. I think you all know whats going to happen from that description. Even though the plot may be predictible and all bu for some reason I just could not stop watching the anime evern though some of the tricks the did even with moter powerd rollerblades was in fact impossible it just added to the enjoyment of the anime. But I did find the ending was a little dissapointing with it being very sudden and did not feel like a real final episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10 \\n\r\nthe art was a little too basic for my liking well i am a but fussy on how the art looks like but it did look cheaply done even though it is quite an old anime made in 2006 I have seen other animes made in 2006 and was done better but back then it must of been average. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nI have to say the anime really shined in sound wise the opening music did really suit this anime as well as the lyrics it gave a great impact of the anime I even found myself watching the opening a seconed time during the episode. The ending was great is well even though there was not a lot of lyrics but the footage of the ending was taken from a rollerbladers point of view but could of been better if the ending was anime as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10 \\n\r\nI found the characters of this anime had some really great development even though I found it hard to believe some of their ages of this anime Ikki who is thirteen but looks and acts like he is 16 even Ringo who looks sixteen and dresses as if she was sixteen. but still from that I found the anime gave good flasbacks that relates to what situation they are in the present. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 \\n\r\nVery enjoyble anime I do recommend this anime but don't watch if you hate nudity because air gear does have a bit of bear boobs in it but it's not forced. any way do try this anime out but I have to say it's not for everyone",

            "content": "Hello there\r\nFor whatever reason I decided it was a clever decision to start watching Air Gear thinking it was somewhat a classic. Sadly I was very wrong.\r\nFirst of all what I noted was the animation was incredibly poor. This is the same year that anime like Code Geass and Death Note, which are 2 very known anime that isn't outdated at all in the animation art. However, Air Gear did not manage to solve the riddle of how to make an anime look well. Already from ep 1 it seemed like they saved money where they could in \"lack\" of animation, and just blurry picturesinstead. This was just one of many problems with the anime. Secondly the characters that were focused on were poor-designed. For instance we have this pink-haired girl who seems very important the first 3 episodes. Then we don't see her then next 15 until she shows up again later on around ending where she is just an observer talking to other observers of the anime...\\n\r\nEnjoyment and story can be taken in one, as I couldn't enjoy a none-existent story that didn't have a flow. It was literally impossible to figure out, what the anime was trying to do, how AT was even considered a sport and many other problems a long with the storyline, that made it impossible to enjoy the \"short\" 25 episode series.\\n\\n\r\nNow you're probably wondering why I gave this a '2'? - The music track for this anime is absolutely awesome. Go to YouTube and google Air Gear Ost and just listen to the beautiful soundtrack, and save yourself the travesty of watching this anime. Just know that the music is awesome and that's all there is to it.\\n\\n",

Motorized... skates, I guess? There are gangs battling for power over territory and the goal is to be the king/queen of this tower.\r\nI find the premise to be interesting enough. Air treks allowing people to perform pretty crazy stunts while battling often mid-air with rival gangs is pretty cool.\r\nHowever, the whole story is pretty bland really. It's not told particularly poorly and it doesn't necessarily suffer from bad pacing... it's just bleh? Predictable in nature, as it's a shounen andfilled all the necessary stops you'd expect one to take but I never felt they landed particularly well. I did find the comedy to be quite humourous though and finished the series based on this alone. It did feel like I was going episode to episode merely for these brief moments.\\n\r\nAs for how it wrapped up, it does essentially end in the middle of a story. Character is supposed to have this moment of great improvement but due to how bland and everything was up until then, I didn't care or revel in it with them. I don't think I would have watched a second season had they made one.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nNot great. \\n\r\nThere were times during the battles where the animation was great but then would cut back to what a pretty sub par art style. And during the last two episodes there was a noticeable dip in the quality which is hard for me to understand considering how sub par it already kind of is.\\n\r\nLike the story, the character designs are bland and uninspired. There are too many girls with pink hair and similar hair styles that it would take a second for me to recognize who exactly these characters were.\\n\r\nSomething that was pretty jarring at the tail end, were shots that were... photographs of real places, i think? They'd just be a full screen photo of city scenery and characters talking of camera and then later they had drawn background with this photographed objects like lanterns and other things. I don't understand the point of it. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nPretty standard. Nothing to bad to say about it. Did what it was supposed to. Songs were re-used far too often to set mood but they weren't bad. Just the repetition. I will say the opening intro song is hype as fuck though, I like it a lot. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, i think characters are the biggest factor I'm gonna hold against the anime.\\n\r\nNone of them were particularly interesting. None of them seemed to have a backstory at all or much agency to achieve what they wanted. And the ones that did have some semblance of backstory was explored all too briefly or just not interesting in the slightest.\\n\r\nThe main character - Ikki, I found hard to cheer along for. I didn't care about him or have a desire to see him succeed. His companions were pretty funny though, which like i said earlier, it was the reason I continued to march on. Especially the guy who rides his AT's via his head.\\n\r\nThe villains... I mean, there's the multiple gang leaders but they're either beaten and then become friends with Ikki or only present for a single episode. And their motivations are the same as Ikki's, it's hard to dislike or like them. The main villain though is peppered throughout in random episodes but also their motivations are unclear. They seem to work for a police unit wanting to make AT illegal but I never get a sense of why that is beyond the fact the gangs are fighting. I guess I don't see the justification for the use of force he opts to use.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, not atrocious. Not great. Pretty squarely in the middle of the road. Had the humour not kept me going I probably would have dropped half way. In fact, I did take a break from it around episode 18 but decided I might as well finish it. I'm willing to consider that at the time of it's release, I might have enjoyed it better and a lot of the people who think of it so highly probably did see it during it's original airing or only a few years later. But i'm watching it in 2016, ten years later. And it's hard for me to recommend this to anyone over the much better shounen//sports anime old or new.",

            "content": "Story: 9/10\r\nThe story is somewhat confusing at first, but you eventually get the hang of it if you watch enough episodes.\r\nWhen I first heard about Air Gear, I was intrigued simply because it was an anime which was about something different - a sort of sport or hobby... However, \"motorized roller blades\" ? That is something entirely different, and I simply had to try it out. After the first episode, I enjoyed it a lot - so I started to watch all the other episodes, and then by the time I realised - I enjoyed Air Gear so much that I practically had watched agood 14 or so episodes. When I was up to episode 14, I said to myself: \"May as well watch the rest!\" - so I did, and nearing the end, it became fantastic! \\n\r\nYou may think 25 episodes is quite a lot, and it can be - however, give it a few episodes to start off by and you will enjoy this anime - especially if you are into roller blading, or motorized mechanics! Heck, even if your into clubs, groups, or gangs.\\n\r\nBy the 25th episode... I wanted more, I wasn't content with just all that... What happened next? Was that all of it? How? Why? Where?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 \\n\r\nI personally enjoyed the art. The wallpapers found on the internet or on google images etc, are amazing! However, in the anime its awesome. Not only does this anime involve male characters with various sizes, attributes, and looks... It also involves female characters, who are all so completely different. Certain parts within the anime can also be called \"art\" in its own way... To those who have seen previews or sneak peaks, or even the whole anime... You'll know what I refer to.. :) Hint: *splash splash*\\n\\n\r\nAnyway enough with that, when Ikki and others battle or race... The art left me speechless. The amount of effort put into all of it was truely inspirational. It also twirls you in, making you wish you were actually doing all of this, being able to ride up walls, go as fast as you want - even \"fly\".\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nFirst things first... Music. When a battle or race starts... When something occurs... It all trascends into a bucket full of... What's the word I'm looking for..? Vibrations? No. Hmm, can't think of the word, but you know what I mean. ;) It's just something which is mind-blowing!\\n\r\nOne of my favourite tracks in this anime would be the opening theme, \"Chain\". (Heck, I even set it as my ring tone! Haha!)\\n\r\nThe music and sounds also involve the viewer to believe that, they are actually participating in what is going on, instead of just watching.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 + Enjoyment: 10/10 \\n\r\nI personally believe that both the Character and Enjoyment of this anime is outstanding. The development of the main character Ikki, is what makes Air Gear, or rather the \"Air Trek\", enjoyable. The better he gets, the more adventurous moments happen. Thus increasing the enjoyment the viewer receives.\\n\r\nThe characters all have certain traits. Heck, they all probably have a time when they can share feelings or traits. Examples would be their clumsiness (just look at one of the female characters). Another could be powerful (one of the 'legendary' Air Trek users). Now, when I say perverted... Who would come to our minds first? The only two, Ikki and Simca, as well as his friend Ringo.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nI don't really have anything else to say or express about this anime, besides the fact that I've rated it 10/10.\\n\r\nIt was one of the animes that I wish were real, sure it would be a health hazzard, however it would also be so much fun and everyone would enjoy it.",

I found myself caught up to the point to where I couldn't, proverbially, put it down. Boy what a ride this anime was for me. \r\nThe characters are pretty damn amazing, if truth be told. Plenty of character development in this 25 episode anime, but not to the point whereas it feels rushed and unrealistic. \r\nThe only reason I gave this an overall 8 out of 10 was because of the ending, which I personally disliked. Not because it was bad, no, but because it leftme wanting more! \\n\\n\r\nThere wasn't much, if anything, that I didn't really like about Air Gear. It was fun, interesting, and a hell of a ride. So all in all, if you haven't watched this anime before go do so, I personally recommend this one to anyone who likes a good laugh and yet with some seriousness thrown into the mix.",

            "content": "Air Gear was one of the very first anime that I\u2019ve seen when I was younger. My only means of watching it at that time was on the television with our language dubbed. You could say it was one of the reasons that sparked my great fascination with animes.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nIt is very much inspired by students and delinquents who have street fights using fictional and advanced roller blades which are very Japanese-like. It is quite ridiculous yet funny that they are practically flying already with just using roller blades. I guess that\u2019s the whole point. It can be hilarious aswell.  I am also amazed on how the mangaka was able to create a story with using roller blades. The story is pretty much clich\u00e9 as we\u2019ve seen so many stories like this. However, during it\u2019s time, it is no doubt one of the most popular series. You could say that if it would be aired for the first time nowadays, I don\u2019t think it can compete head on with famous series of today. It was definitely better that it aired before when this type of storylines were not overly-used yet.  The storylines might be very typical but the plot is still absolutely original. The lines made the characters cooler but it has the tendency to be so cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nFor a 26 episodes series it has a wide range of characters. Simca is absolutely the most irritating character among the characters with all her schemes and manipulations. Ikki is an example of the stereotype male protagonist who usually starts off as very weak then throughout the series becomes stronger and stronger. As clich\u00e9 as it is, this kind of character is always a sure hit because it is really inspiring when we get to see characters who despite so many obstacles still manages to get stronger. It is exciting in its own way. Ikki has almost all the clich\u00e9s that a male lead has. He\u2019s like an idiot who thinks nothing but getting stronger. He shouts when his fighting and usually easily manipulated. He can be extremely irritating because of being cocky and arrogant most of the times. Like most male protagonists, he also has the strange ability to persuade his enemies and make them his ally. He also makes his own group of strong individuals. And to top it up, usually even though they are initially weak, they become strong because somehow they have very unique abilities; its either fictional abilities or just physical. Actually, these characteristics usually become very irritating however it definitely works for this type of character most especially for shonen type of stories. The very reason why until now it is still a sure hit.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION and SOUNDS\\n\r\nThe illustrations of how magnificent a particular character, is very much exciting but it has the tendency to be over the top. By the way, what\u2019s with male protagonists having one hell of a spiky hair? Most of the famous male protagonists have spiky hairs. Does that make them a lot cooler because I really don\u2019t think that is the case? The sounds are very much appropriate with the theme of the series which are about teenagers and delinquents. It gives a lot more spunk and hip with the series. It made every movement a lot cooler.\\n\\n\r\nI genuinely loved Air Gear during the first time I saw it when I was younger and still very much na\u00efve with the anime world. I had these very wonderful memories of it when I was watching it in the television with our language dubbed. However, now that I\u2019ve been watching animes for a very long time and already encountered a lot of different stories, I just can\u2019t find myself appreciating it the way that I appreciated it before now that I\u2019ve seen it in the original version. I absolutely don\u2019t want to sound arrogant now that I\u2019ve encountered so many different series but it really does have a very typical storylines. This couple of years, there are tons of typical storylines like this one but despite that they really can compete head on with famous series of today. Thank God that I\u2019ve seen it for the first time 5 years ago and not now because I believe I wouldn\u2019t be able to appreciate it. Plus, it really does look like the story is just beginning after the last episode.\\n",

            "content": "Story: 7\r\nMy main complaint about the story is that it is too abbreviated. There is a lot of build up and then the series just ends, making the rest of the story feel sort of pointless. The entire series contains talk of the main charchter, Ikki, becoming the \"Sky King\" but the finale occurs well before that is close to happening. Very inconclusive. Another season would certainly be in order. I haven't read the manga but I'm sure it has more to offer. \r\nArt: 9\r\nThe characters look good, and the skating scenes are absolutely amazing. \r\nSound: 9 \r\nThere is some prety great music in thisshow, always really appropriate to the setting. I especially enjoyed the certain song that came on whenever a particularly &quot;badass&quot; character or gang showed up. \\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThis score would be much higher, but I have the same problem with this category that I do with the story. The main characters are given plenty of screen time for one to get to know them and get attached to them, but I really feel like the most interesting characters are in the supporting cast, such as Spitfire and Akira. I think this anime would have benefitted significantly by giving them more attention. Perhaps this could have been achieved in a second season.\\n\r\nThe exception to this is anti-hero Agito. He is the one truly dynamic/interesting character that I feel was given a good amount of development.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThis is a purely personal thing. At the beginning, we see a lot of learning, a lot of trial and error type stuff on Ikki's part. This is, of course, neccesary, but not that enjoyable to watch. Towards the end it gets more into superpower type stuff, not just from Ikki but from all of the characters and that is where I really was able to indulge in the action aspect of the series and found it extremely fun to watch. There are battle scenes that make up a huge percentage of the show, and those are always great.\\n\r\nI really do not like &quot;fanservice&quot;, and this anime contains tons of that. Lots of nudidy and sexual overtones. Certainly not a plus for me. \\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nThis anime contains a lot of really awesome things, but considering how short the series is these things weren't given nearly enough time to show themselves. Overall, I would say it is worth watching. Just try not to get too into the plot because it iwll not be resloved. Just enjoy the action while it happens.",

            "content": "Air Gear is an anime that I feel people should watch for fun but haven't. It is a sports anime which is a turn off for most people but it shouldn't be.  The series is very good and enjoyable to watch.  At least that's what I said before I saw the ending of the show and met the characters.\r\nStory:\r\nThis might take a while to explain but I will try my best.  The story focuses around Ikki, a clumsy curious teenager.  One day he discovers Air Trecks in a closet which he decides to test out. Please note Air Trecks (or theshort form of the word ATs) are basically motorized roller blades.  He decides he loves ATs and decides to recruit people into a team he created.  Teams compete against one another in battles/races to decide who is the best team (or gang whatever you prefer to call them).  This is the story of Ikki creating his team and trying to become the best around.  This story is very good and well paced with lots of sub plots that are very interesting.  The only problem is that at the end it just stops.  I kid you not the last episode just ends on filler and the main point of the story is never reached.  This ending was just a slap to the face to an above average show and ruined part of the experience.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe animation for it's time was decent.  It wasn't amazing but it wasn't terrible either it was just a little above average.  Not much else to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe music was great for the show and helped flesh out the scenes of the show. That being said I didn't find anything that stood out other than the opening for the show.  It's like the animation.  It's good but not really memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is where it tends to fall down.  Air Gear has lots of characters that are really fun to watch and very interesting.  The problem is most characters didn't develop and had no back story.  There were a couple that were done well like Ikki, but some of them felt less like characters and more like extras.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAir Gear despite all its flaws was very fun to watch.  I loved watching it and couldn't wait to move on to the next episode.  However this is not something for everyone.  If your looking for something enjoyable to watch and not take too seriously then stop looking.  However for everyone else despite it being a fun watch personally, the bland characters and terrible ending will turn most people off.  It's not a terrible show but it's far from being fantastic.  So in the end it's your call.  So if you want something fun to watch give it a shot.",

            "content": "Well this wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I knew going into this that the title suggested a high flying adventure. But little did I know that I was about to be hit with a unique concept that would warrant a more delicate eye. I mean as delicate as I can when your looking at S-S-S-SUPER MOTORIZED ROLLERBLADES!!!!1\r\nWhile the story is a little vague on what its characters trying to achieve, because there is little I know of to compare it too in terms of style, i suppose it worked for what it was. However, even though it told this story, it wasn't done quickenough. By the time the anime was over, several questions had been left unanswered, and the story felt like it ended just as it was about to come out of it's filler phase (the points in anime where stuff happens, but it does nothing to strengthen the overall plot). As the anime goes on, you will begin to notice the same themes being hit OVER AND OVER again, without any fresh ideas. By the end of the anime, I was done with it and desired nothing more, and never will (the ending makes it very clear)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime were pretty hit or miss. There were quite a few moments where the characters truly made me laugh out loud.  While the minor characters were unique, each with their own personality as well as strengths and weaknesses, the main character Ikki just seemed far too generic a anime hero. He even kind of reminded me of a blue haired Naruto, and that's not a complement. He even has a similar ramen obsession during some episodes!\\n\\n\r\nFor everything that this anime did right with its unique idea of high speed races and battles, and highly satisfying action scenes, it seemed to do something wrong in either its technical or story elements. One thing that bothered me on a few occasions was when the animation literally stopped or became something like a flashart cartoon as the audio kept going. I went back through the episodes on 3 different computers to confirm that it wasn't an issue with my hardware. That's simply lazy animating. On the story telling point, there was absolutely no need for the nudity and the cursing! While I did somewhat enjoy these moments, I could never get the idea out of my mind that at the beginning of the anime it stated that Ikki was a 13 year old..... nuf said.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its flaws, I actually enjoyed this anime. It was a fresh concept, with a satisfying set of tricks up its sleeve. Because I enjoyed it as much as did personally, I would have given it an 8/10. But due to some bad writing and animation, i'm going to have to drop it down a point.\\n\\n\r\nI give Air Gear a 7/10. FLY! (over and over and over and over and over....)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me start off by saying...the idea of powerful motorized roller blades caught me the minute I read the synopsis since, I'm someone who had been roller blading for years as a casual sport. Add some out-of-this-world super gears and a lot of imagination, you get Air Gear; an anime that I loved since the english dub version came out. (The last part is a bit out of context but I'll get to that later)\r\nStory:\r\nWhat more can I say? The story follows a boy on his journey of discovering his true talents and passion with 'Air Trek's and becoming a Storm Rider. Typical shounen plotand it does have super fancy battles but what is not to love about all that with a shounen anime? Combined with sports and a ton of sexy ladies AND men, this anime is much more fun to watch that way. I have to say, I was VERY disappointed that it ended at 25 episodes...there was so much more to be exploited from the manga! Yet, they chose to end it as such a boring final battle and leaving plenty of unanswered conflicts. And for that, no matter how fun it was to dive into the story, I cannot give it above an 8 and I'm being generous about it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nHmmm... at some points, the anime does have its art a little wonky compared to the beauty of the mangaka's art style but I cannot turn a blind eye towards the animation though. It was BEAUTIFUL especially in scenes where it showcased the fluid movements of the Storm Riders doing tricks and all the fancy stuff. Hahaha...they definitely brought the manga to life with the animation and it is one of the reasons why I'm so disappointed that they ended the anime. Check out the OVAs! THEY WERE PERFECT! Just like most sport animes, Air Gear stands out with its fluid animation and I have no problems about that!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nRight from the get-go we get the opening and let me tell you, I have that very song on my phone's playlist and even its MAGINIFICENTRAL MIX version by Skankfunk RIGHT NOW and that is enough to describe how much I love the soundtrack for this anime. Not to mention the hip-hop theme totally matches the overall mood of the anime. 10/10 FLAWLESS.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nYou can hate on the characters all you want for many reasons but I'm still giving it a perfect score. Truth be told, I hated Ringo and at first it was due to her Japanese seiyuu...I'm sorry but she sounded unnecessarily annoying in Japanese. Not only Ringo but Ikki sounded completely awkward in Japanese too. And here is where I confess that I actually prefer watching Air Gear in ENGLISH DUB. OH EM GEE...THIS IS BLASPHEMOUS.\\n\r\nBut I'm being honest and I definitely find the english version much more suitable for the character's personas. Oh, and did I mention the coherent cursing that we get in the dub version? For once they don't sound awkward and it perfectly suited the characters! Maybe it's just me, and yeah...how the hell can I ever admit that the dub is better than the original version?\\n\r\nI still don't know till this day. Do hate on me for this if you'd like but whatever~\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall:\\n\r\nOnce you watched Air Gear, you HAVE to read the manga. And no, do not start reading from where the anime left off...start over from the beginning. Oh-Great's art will not ever disappoint you. Despite my disappointment that the anime ended at such an abrupt point of the story, I still highly recommend this anime to anyone. It's fun, vibrant and original.\\n\r\nI still wish that Air Gear could get a reboot if not a continuation...I mean, D.Gray Man just got its break once again and they are continuing the anime after nearly a decade (HALLELUJAH~~~!) and who knows? Maybe Air Gear could get one too...because it is a great anime and manga in my personal opinion and I do wish it would get more love by all fellow anime fans. <3\\n\\n",

            "content": "Air Gear is a solid 7 but WHAT a 7 do we have in front of us. It's a little hidden treasure in the anime world.\r\nI started watching it because it was pending on my list for a long, long time and at first it was nothing spectacular. The premise about a world where a sport called Air Treck, where you use high tech skates, was very popular and there where gangs, tournaments and competitions to determinate who is the best. It was really fresh to me, the battles where very street-like with not overwhelming powers, it was more down-to-earth but it still had thatfantastic essence in the way this where performed.\\n\\n\r\nWatching episode after episode, I started to like the show even more and more. The characters where a different archetype. They're the main personalities but with a twist and that makes them HILARIOUS and likeable. I laugh A LOT in the first 10 - 12 episodes, as I also really enjoyed the battles. I absolutely loves their school teacher, Ton-Chan. We don't really get why she is the way she is, but her personality made me laugh like I haven't in some time.\\n\\n\r\nFrom episode 13 we start to get more serious plot, our main character starts to gain renown and that brings him troubles within his environment. From here we get some great, full of action but with some fun moments in between, battles, and that's something I love about Air Gear. The comedy doesn't desestimate the plot at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe last arc of the series was a little fail for me, I think it took a few steps back comparing it to the hype it generated to me with the previous Behemoth arc. What I'm trying to say is, the finale leaves the door open for a continuation that we never got and it was very light. I would loved to see an ending with more impact.\\n\\n\r\nWithin all the things I loved about Air Gear: the comedy, the action, the freshness of it's core; there are some that I didn't like and those were the reason I didn't give this show a higher score. There were some blank spaces (that I'm not going to spoil) in the plot, some things that were just put there and never got and explanation about where did they came from or what they really meant. I researched a little about the manga and I got some of those answers I needed, but if you don't do that or you just don't go and read the manga, you're not going to get them.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not really that kind of guy that gives attention to the Sound, but I could say it was ok. The Art was fine, just fine, but it gave the anime a particular vibe that made it go perfect with it. I actually prefer this \"fine\" kind of drawing. You can watch the OVA that came out some years after and, even though the action is great, that new and more modern style, in my opinion, takes away some of the charm that Air Gear has.\\n\\n\r\nWith a common story, a main character that wants to be the best/achieve something but with a breath of fresh air, adecuated art and enjoyable characters, Air Gear made me stay on the edge of my seat, laughing and rooting for our main group of characters. It was a really joyful and entertaining journey and I'm glad I started it.",

I was one of those people thinking \"oh, it's about sports\" and I thought it would be like Yu-Gi-Oh! or Pokemon but after the first 3 episodes, I got hooked to the series. \r\nNow onto the ratings.\r\nStory : 9/10\r\nThe story was excellent as far as the anime went, I didn't read the manga but the way they ended the episodes made you want more.  It was just one of those animes that ended the episodes rightto make you want to watch more.  The anime itself was very enjoyable and I thought I should give it a 9 because it wasn't the best, but it was a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was that of your average anime, with a bit of uniqueness but not enough to make you think it's CG or something.  Not that it should be, but the art work wasn't as good as some newer animes and airgear isn't that old.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 7/10\\n\r\nAlthough the sounds in the anime were unique in their own way, they were heard way too much and kind of got annoying.  For this, the sound gets a 7/10 rating.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 3/10\\n\r\nThe characters were well developed, some not so much but and the anime had me questioning some things a bit.  For this I give character a 3/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10/10\\n\r\nAlthough I didn't get my full satisfaction of the anime, I enjoyed it to the very end.  This is a must watch anime for people who enjoy funny, magical, a bit of ecchi, and adventerous types of anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL I give Airgear a 9/10.\\n\r\n-This has been a review by Darkwarzx.

            "content": "To be honest, I was hooked after the first episode. It has a different focus then most animes would have...Rollerblading gangs and there want to reach the top. Sounds bad...but really it isnt. The main character Itsuki \"Ikki\" Minami, lives with 4 sisters. Though they arent actually his sisters. He discovers a pair of skates in the house..more like a room of awesomeness...and he takes em for a ride. Now when i say rollerblades i was being funny. these arent just any normal blades, they make you fly. The story line is more about his journey of reaching the top and the feets he mustovercome to get there. Its comical and also full of action. The other characters in the anime drive the story and you feel like litle by litle you are apart of this journey he is taking too. I came across this anime by luck i guess i was looking for Air lol and found Air Gear. Loved it...watched it twice now!",

            "content": "Despite the fact of me writing this I must say this, how many of you have waited for a season 2 of air gear, fallen in love with the songs and read the manga. I personally have waited 4 years for a season 2 writing reviews and suggesting donation sites so as to allow any company to make a season 2. Despite this beautiful exiting anime the producers decide to make season 2 of hentai and other ir-relevant anime which do not really have a story line but they make a season 2 anyway. Well this should be my 54th review as I have writtenon multiple sites and I will say this AIR GEAR is not bad it was released at the wrong time. This was when naruto, bleach and fairytail were being released and hence this anime was left in the dark and not given the credit it really required.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I loved the music the simple tricks and the moment of adrenalin rush when someone does that instant move which determines the battle. I have watched the entire anime more than 15 times and the battles more than I can keep count.\\n\\n\r\nThis will be my last review here because people say fan service but I guess the producers would rather make a new season of some completely random anime with boobs and continue with fillers rather than respond to the people actually giving them their opinions ( as I suggested  a donation site like gogoanime to actually make a season 2) . Personally those who havnt seen Air Gear please watch it, personally I love the anime the characters and I might look like a little kid getting exited for a few fights but that's what its all about!!!!

The series almost never took it self seriously. The idea of the series is that main character Ikki,  a perverted hyperactive idiot who always acts before thinking, discovers a futuristic rollerblade like sport and starts a competitive team/street  gang. Rival teams race or fight each other to gain status. half of the characters are boring stereotypes, but the other half are ridiculously over the top and entertaining. Also despite randomness of whether they are fighting, racing, or whatever theydecide to do at the time the action scenes are pretty entertaining. The series really shines in the voice acting though. Anyone who hates english dubs should watch this series just to hear one done right. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Plot sucks, english voice acting is great",

That being said the anime was a huge disappointment.\r\n-Story-\r\nThe story relative to the manga did not do the series any justice. It was short lived, rushed and didn't flow very well. It didn't get very far considering how far the manga actually goes so it really saddened me that the series didn't even get a chance to bloom.\r\n-Art-\r\nWhile the manga itself has some of the best art I have ever seen, the animation quality for the anime is just decent. The animation scenes and action sequencesalso didn't seem to have very high production value seeing as they weren't as smooth as I expected them to be.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nThe sound track is probably the only high point of this series. I absolutely love the opening and ending themes as well as the OST. If there is one thing people can take out of this series it's the music, but it's not enough to propel the series into getting a better grade.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nAs noted in my opening statement, I have read the series in manga format and watched the anime in it's entirety. That being said I found the series hard to swallow. I had high expectations going into the first couple episodes only to leave disappointed and longing for something more.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\r\nThis is one of those series if i get asked about I simply tell people to \"just read it.\"",

Great, the creator of the series, has a habit of talking in metaphors and in various zen ways, if you pay attention you won't be confused when a character speaks in a metaphor.\r\n Usually it takes anime series 3-4 episodes to get the storyline/central theme of the current arc going. With Air Gear ittook an episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is to be standard for a Ecchi style, Competition anime. Gratuitous ammounts of fanservice, is applied. The action/competition sequences are standard for a shounen series. Over-elaborate attack sequences and dramatic poses are expected.\\n\\n\r\nThe action/combat sequences in Air Gear are well done, and the series is full of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is one of my favorite things about this anime. Definently different from the shounen themes of anime. The opening sequence has excellent music, the visualization is appropriate for the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are interesting however they are somewhat to be expected coming from a shounen series.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series, and I enjoy the manga as well. If you have seen Eureka 7 and enjoyed it for the storyline and what not, you will like Air Gear.",

            "content": "The plot of Air Gear was very original, I haven't heard of any other anime where characters wear skates that propel them to the ceiling.\r\nBeing female, at first, I didn't much enjoy the idea of skating as  a main storyline. But as the series progressed, I found it exciting, and I kept on wondering what would happen to Ikki's next duel each time one episode concluded. I also didn't imagine how one would be able to incorporate action into roller blades. After all, usually, people just skate around tracks and perform exhibitions. But Air Gear was something much different. The fighting scenes were exceptionallygood, because none of the members of Kogarasumaru faced an opponent below the standard level, and the certain challenges the antagonists presented made me ask myself how they would be able to escape it all alive.\\n\r\nEven the sound impressed me. Normally, I don't mind the songs, but this one even made me go all out and memorize it.\\n\r\nThe design of Akito's bipolar character was interesting, and the romantic, and sometimes even cheesy thoughts of Ringo toward Ikki turned into hilarious comedy. Though I would not recommend it for my age( I am a twelve year old), based on Ikki's attitude toward the ladies, this is definitely a must watch for lovers of good anime.",

The first time I looked at Air Gear I thought that it was just a random anime but I realized that I was so wrong. The first thing that catches my eye was the way the anime incorporates its music. I would say that the music made the battle scenes more intense. I love the battle scenes. They are going to make you think what's going to happen next. I just felt pumped up for the next episode. In the anime, the main character has to find who he isas a Storm Rider. I'm amazed on how much the main character changed from the first to the last from skill to maturity. Although the plot made me kind of questionable and there was a little bit of flaws; the overall theme was just right. Every anime has its own charm. I would say that this is a good anime to pass the day. When I finished this anime it made me say \"I wish I had my own pair of Air Treks too\".  Overall I would say this anime is good and best of luck.",

The ending of this just make you feel '' i want much more''.\r\nFor the review i can say:\r\nStory: About a boy named Ikki who overcome one day the motorized air treck and wants to be best. Very nice story building up and many battles between clans of the air treck. Just watch it amazing anime.\r\nArt: Very good not much more to say about it.\r\nSound: I love the music, and the sounditself is great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Realy good load of characters. Many different kind of people Ikki meet in his journey. And what is so great aboout it is that all of them stands out in their own cool way. I love that Akito/Agito character a split personality hilarious. He is using the F word prety often in the best situations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: One word Outstanding. I loved this one, and i have not seen too many anime yet but for what i have seen so far i must say i have never longed so much for more episodes in my life. I realy hope they will make a second season some day.",

It has an original concept and the composition is great. What really keeps you watching is the action, and surprisingly enough, the simple plot. Somehow it is pretty easy to become interested in the characters' progress through the plot. Although, after completing the anime, I would DEFINITELY recommend watching the OVAs, which in my opinion, are slightly better than the anime as a whole.\r\nPROS:\r\n     VERY cool art styleInteresting concept\\n\r\n     Easy to follow\\n\r\n     Action: its what realkeeps you watching\\n\r\n     Several memorable characters\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n     Predictable storyline\\n\r\n     Not as good as the OVAs\\n\r\n     The ending is rushed and leaves too many cliff-hangers\\n\r\n     Not willing to re-watch",

Usually I find that when drastic things like that happens I'll hate it from the beginning and have to get used to it.\r\nThe use of background music was amazing, it really added affect to some of the intense or emotional scenes.  Another thing I like about this anime, is that I didn't really find any characters that I dislike, usuallya there's one or two that are just unbelievably obnoxious or way too bubbly, but I liked them all.\\n\\n\r\nGreat anime, you must watch it!",

I especially love the teenage and adult female characters on the show because, their figure looks amazingly sexy. The music makes me want to dance which I normally don't do. As for enjoyment, I love it so much that I record it on VCR to watch it over and over again. Now i'm watching it on PS3.  As for the season, I would like to see season 2 and more seasons to come since they aredone with the manga. If they actually make more seasons then this anime will turn out to be my favorite.",

I tried to rewatch it, but the show doesn't have this appeal. \r\nWas one of the first animes that i watched, before Shingeki no Kyojin or FMAB.\r\nStill, is better than Naruto Shippuuden.\r\n If you want to watch some mediocre anime, watch this one. Not the over-hyped and extremely poorly produced anime mentioned above, that translates to \"Naruto waste of lifetime\".\r\nThere's not much to say about this anime,but MAL want that i write more, so i'll list a series of movies, books, games and anime that are more worthwhile than Naruto Shippuuden:\\n\\n\r\n-Naruto, the original series, without the fillers\\n\r\n-Arrival (2016), the amazing Sci-fi movie from Denis Villeneuve\\n\r\n-The Kingkiller Chronicle book series. So far there's only two of three books avaiable to read: The Name of The Wind and The Wise Man's Fear. I'm reading the second one, these books are an AMAZING FANTASY STORY. READ IT. JUST DO IT.\\n\r\n-Pok\u00e9mon, the game. Anyone from the GB, GBC, GBA, DS, DSi, 3DS. Even Pok\u00e9mon GO is more worth than Shippuuden.\\n\r\n-Kimi No Na Wa (2016), never cried harder because of an anime. The art is FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. AMAZING. WATCH IT.\\n\r\n-Haikyuu!! Excellent sport anime. My favorite since Captain Tsubasa.\\n\\n\r\nThat's what i can think from the top of my mind.\\n\\n\r\nSee ya.",

            "content": "Air gear is an exciting out going anime, but undoubtedly suffers from a lacking of an ending, due to low fan base and funding. None the less it is well made anime in my eyes. Well versed anime viewers may state that Air Gear is a little clich\u00e9, I found that the initial episodes act as stepping stones to a well planned story and is there to ease the viewer into a deeper story.  The story starts out simple, street level racing, school friends, family, and Air Trek gangs but later on  transforms into a much grander story. With hard decisions which arenot simply black and white but rather smothered in shades of grey.\\n\\n\r\nAir Gear gains your attention with a combination of love triangles, protagonist achievements, memorable quotes/one liners, fan service, and comedy. Many scenes that contain \"action\" are done respectively in contrast to to Air Treks being motorised roller blades. \\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist Itsuki (Ikki) Minami is a traditional Shounen style character who develops as the story progresses, he gets stronger and beats harder enemies. Unlike normal Shounen style characters he has a lot of human features that normal Shounen heroes seem to lack consistently. He is jealous, crude, self absorbed, lustful, sly, cunning, and even at times disturbing. These features make him relate able, and loveable (for some).       \\n\\n\r\nSkankfunks use of remixes and original music complements Air Gear. The moments where a revelation occurs or an impressive trick is in motion songs like Chain - Magnificentral are played to hype the scene which it definitely does. Songs such as Chain - Acoustic Cowboy Mix produces a light mood between characters. Anthem for Pipe Dreams produces an extremely sinister atmosphere of unease which also goes for Chain - Massiveness. \\n\\n\r\nAir Gear has a lot of twists and turns, hidden secrets discover and plenty of character development though primary focus is placed on the protagonist (Shounen) attention is given to other characters as well. \\n\\n\r\nAir Gear is not for everyone that is the truth or else it would be at the top of the anime/manga list, but it's unique concept on the traditional Shounen style separates it from the rest. It is highly addictive and compelling anime, I watched 1-25 in a single night without sleep (honestly). I highly recommend Air Gear to anyone, and i hope my review allows you to see something in Air Gear others have not.",

I cant give it above a 7 because I dont feel it has quitethe same level of quality as a lot of anime's and it can get seriously strange. If you want to enjoy this anime, dont come in sceptical. Just relax and enjoy it, even when it gets ever so slightly ridiculous. Switch off and you'll enjoy it.\\n\r\nHowever there was one thing that irritated me= the way it ended. Its kinda like they ran out of budget during an arc that wasnt finished yet. The art kinda sucked too but because this anime was low budget (crazy low from what I hear), this can be forgiven.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave the anime a 7.\\n\r\nI dont feel that it deserves above this based solely on the soundtrack- which BTW would be a 10.",

After thatthe story provides a fast paced action - adventure!\\n\\n\r\nArt -\\n\\n\r\nI will have to go with 8 here but art isn't the main feature of this anime, anyways. The animation is quite clean and modern.\\n\\n\r\nSound -\\n\\n\r\nOkay, this is an anime with one of the best, if not the best, background music ever. The way it is synced with the story and scenes is brilliant!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are very well defined. I mean great character development. If the 8-9 episode delay in the story has served anything, it is this (character development). By the 6th episode, i was pretty sure that all the characters are hardcore straight up PUNKS!\\n\\n\r\nevery character has a significance in the story and it is brilliantly shown!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt can be feel good but then intense, and then comedy/romance and then intense. I enjoyed it just like a roller coaster. Going up in anticipation, coming down like thunder but ending unsatisfying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - \\n\\n\r\n9/10 for being Dang AWESOME!\\n\\n\r\nEverything was managed very well. This anime is going down in history along with Death Note and FullMetal Alchemist.\\n\\n\r\n---------------\\n\\n\r\nMisc -\\n\\n\r\nThis anime contains lots (and by lots I mean A LOT) of fan service, especially in the beggining!\\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn't have a proper ending, it leaves us in a particular chapter of the manga, so if you tend to get connected to something quickly and find trouble getting over it, go for the manga and not the anime.\\n\\n\r\nPriority: A must-see anime, comes right after Death Note, FullMetal Alchemist and Code Geass. If you want to see the best on animes, this one is right there at #4 or #5!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",
