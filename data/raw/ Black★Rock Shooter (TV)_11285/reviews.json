            "content": "Black\u2605Rock Shooter would be the last time that I will ever watch with the name Mari Okada in it. I should have learned my lesson with the pile of nonsense Fractale, but nooooo! I JUST HAD to watch this until the end.\r\nOkay, I admit, not all of it was bad. For starters, the use of CGI in this anime was superb. I mean, really. I think BRS established a new standard in me when looking at CGI in anime. The fight scenes were well-made, and the level of violence put in here is nothing to laugh at. BUT, I\u2019m afraid everything else just felt\u2026 ridiculousand pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nI think Mari Okada has a tendency to place unusually large values on topics that don\u2019t really matter and focuses the attention of her writing into creating some of the most angsty anime to ever grace television screens. Fractale had a lot of this that I won\u2019t even bother pointing out. Ano Hana spent too time showing that the character\u2019s couldn\u2019t move on from Menma\u2019s death, as well as OMG IT\u2019S SO SAD LET\u2019S ALL CRY scene from its eleventh episode. BRS had all of this unjustified insanity, characters whose actions don\u2019t make sense, and yes, one of my most hated things about anime, glorifying trivial subjects.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, BRS used insanity very poorly. It\u2019s like asking a fifth grader to write how he thinks insane people act. It\u2019s unnerving, but not quite believable. Let\u2019s take for example Kagari\u2019s behavior. Okay, fine, she was creepy and all that, but I just couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling that there\u2019s something amiss. She felt less like a disturbed person and more like someone feigning insanity to get away with a crime. The same can be said about everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\u2019 actions do not make sense. Why would Yomi\u2019s mother tolerate Kagari\u2019s outrageous behavior toward her own daughter? Why would Saya torture students who weren\u2019t even involved with her problem (Kohata)? How did they know for certain that Mato was BRS, Yomi was DM or Kagari was Chariot? A lot of other questions remain. This is like Fractale all over again.\\n\\n\r\nAs with Ano Hana, I had a lot of trouble trying to sympathize with the events of the story. In the end, the anime ended up being about saving Yuu from the other world. That much is clear. My only problem with this is that the way they did it was so bad. It felt empty. I couldn\u2019t really describe it, but I was so frustrated while I was watching the final episode that I even considered dropping it then and there. It\u2019s the same feeling that I had with Ano Hana. I just don\u2019t like it, and I won\u2019t bother trying to find out why.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think Black Rock Shooter could have been much, much more. All of the flaws I have pointed out can all be traced back to the writing. If this show had a different writer, I think a lot of the problems with this show would not be as frustrating as they had become. Sure, the angst will still be all over the place, but at least it won\u2019t be Mari Okada Angst. I give Black Rock Shooter TV my personal MAL rating of 5, which should have been a 3 if it wasn\u2019t for the cool CGI.",

            "content": "Ahh, Black Rock Shooter\u2026 je t'aime\r\nIn the 1960s, which is 60 years before when I come from which is the future, a recondite avant garde composer by the name of Captain Beefheart graced the airwaves with his trundling avant garde music that challenged the status quo of blues music with a menagerie of outr\u00e9 bumps and scrapes, replete with a healthy dose of guttural growls, vaguely resembling music. Yet these renegade evocative soundscapes informed a portent of society. In order for progress to subsist, artistic vanguards like this are of incorrigible necessity.\r\nNow, I'm going to go on a bit of a tangent here, so pleasebare with me. In comparable fashion, the incandescent, avant garde Dada movement was birthed by way of the antipodal reaction to the indelible horrors of World War Un. This international movement was embarked by a collective of adroit artists and poets consummately associated with the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich. Dada rejected reason and logic, prizing a m\u00e9lange of nonsense, irrationality and intuition. The origin of the name Dada is difficult to parse; some believe that it is a nonsensical word. Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists Tristan Tzara's and Marcel Janco's frequent use of the words da, da, meaning yes, yes in the Romanian language. Another paradigmatic theory states that the nom de plume \"Dada\" came during a confluence of the group when a paper-ladeden knife stuck into a French-German dictionary happened to indicate a sequence of letters spelling out 'dada', a French word for 'hobbyhorse'. Their greatest accomplishment, however, was paving the way for Black Rock Shooter, and in turn, this highly intellectual essay I am writing.\\n\\n\r\nIn the avant garde tradition of dadaism, Black Rock Shooter tells the tale of budding young girls coping with the malaise of growing up by way of nigh-poetic alternative reality battle sequences. These obstreperous alternative reality segments, an oneiric substrate of the recursive subconscious, serve as a brilliantly heuristic amalgam: the asynchronous parallelogram that is the human mind is an esoteric and, at times, untenable beast; one that Black Rock Shooter, in all its thematic opulence, seizes magnanimously, spinning it's own immutable and immaculate web that, while subtly didactic, masterfully explicates the manifold human condition on the precipice of the acquiescence of maturity with a very natural demure about it. In the words of Lester Bangs, \"Every great work of art has two faces, one toward its own time and one toward the future, toward eternity.\" Well played, Mr Bangs. Well played.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you'll bare with me for a bit longer, I'd like to expound upon what a \"character\" is before diving headfirst into Black Rock Shooter's puissant ensemble cast. To cite wikipedia: \"A character is a person in a narrative work of arts (such as a novel, play, television show/series, or film).[1] Derived from the ancient Greek word kharakt\u00ear, the English word dates from theRestoration,[2] although it became widely used after its appearance in Tom Jones in 1749.[3][4] From this, the sense of \"a part played by an actor\" developed.[4] Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the theatre or cinema, involves \"the illusion of being a human person.\"[5] In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes.[6] Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase \"in character\" has been used to describe an effective impersonation by an actor.[4] Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practised by actors or writers, has been called characterisation.[4]\"\\n\\n\r\nThat is what a \"character\" is. Now you \"know\".\\n\\n\r\nTu m'\u00e9tonnes. And the \"characters\", ahh the \"characters\"\u2026!!! So many \"characters\", so many \"feelings\". As I consider it, nigh all of them are connected. In point of fact, the teacher is as well. Mato, a protean Humbert Humbert of sorts, is our intrepid protagonist. Feebly equipoised, Mato is a veritable \"domino theory\" of emotions. Everything from :D to >:O is covered consummately, leaving no stone left unturned, n'est-ce pas! In no other piece of fiction has the kaleidoscopic array of humanity been so thoroughly covered, and with such nuance to boot. Astute viewers will be on the edge of their seat as Mato confronts inherently relatable, quotidian issues, such as being dealt the \"dirty colored macaroons\" by a periphery, recalcitrant acquaintance; clearly a profound yet subtle metaphor for fate and one's lot in life. This essayist is pleased to report that you can expect many more ruminations on life like this promulgated throughout, so please be gently with everyone. Case in point, Black Rock Shooter, Mato's acousm\u00eatre alter ego, is in constant conflict with an elusive, Kafkaesque clout beyond her control; a startling depiction bureaucracy that rivals such notable works as \"1994\" and \"Brave  World\" in its deft, metaphysical illustrations. Furthermore, White Album 2 uses many emotions to bring out emotions. These emotions then show us the emotions of the characters and hence develop them and give us emotions as well while watching this. Veni, vidi, vici.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Rock Shooter truly is a psychologically variegated, ephemeral Musique concr\u00e8te-esque urbane (to coin a neologism) tree-being-chopped-down-when-no-one-is-around-does-anyone-hear-it.!?!. It is a sterling example of anime's edifying artistic potential and stands out sumptuously in the moribund, fetid, meretricious sea of ancillary noxious pabulum that is the anime industry. It is the vanguard avant garde artistic achievement we need. If you'll excuse me for using a downright plebeian parlance of our contemptuous times, it is Absolutely Life Affirming: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nCaptain Beefheart would be proud. il y a quelque chose qui cloche m\u00e9tro, boulot, dodo  Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nYuri factor, however, is a paltry 4.2793/10. Mere inklings of shoujo-ai allusions are all that await you in Black Rock Shooter, in terms of yuri. Don't assuage, however. Abide. Besides, are yuri main for you? \\n\\n\r\nPS: I don't know why I said PS, but this is my maiden voyage review. CONSTRUCTIVE feedback is heartily encouraged. I'd say \"Thanks for reading\", but let's be honest, you should be thanking me for allowing you to read it. :3\\n\\n\r\nTune in next week for my review of Lunch Poems by Frank O'Hara, faithful reader.

            "content": "When watching Black Rock Shooter OAV, I remember seeing the original HUKE mv and thinking, \"Simple. Makes sense.\"\r\nThen the TV came in. I was first of all shocked by all the changes, then I was surprised the story had taken a different turn, and then came the new characters added. What had happened to the original animation I had fallen in love with? There was a bunch of mixed emotions as I had such high expectations. And that was only the first half of the first episode.\r\nAnd then I watched the first one. And then the second. I was literally hooked.\r\nWhy?\r\nFirst of all, for onlythirty minutes of animation, it was well put together! Everything was clear and I didn't have a headache by the end of each episode. I was just ready for the next one. \\n\r\nThe animation helped with that as well. The fights after all, are nothing to over look, the 3D hanging between CGI and 2D. It's entirely too engrossing.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the suspense killed me. What was going to happen? Who was going to do what? The story was so interestingly new and made me want to discover more about it. What was this other world, how did it work and in what ways were these girls truly connected to it? My questions were all answered in a way I was completely satisfied with. So far, nothing has been left out for me that would keep me unable to comprehend the story.\\n\\n\r\nThird, I wanted to say, THIS IS MIDDLE SCHOOL! There's supposed to be DRAMA! And is there Drama! With a capital D! It makes me enjoy the luxuries of being an adult in my own world, because I would never want to grow up as a young girl in the world of BRS! This was especially increased by the latter episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I believe that this anime is one of the more enjoyable art pieces in Japan that I have found over the last few years to watch. Constantly, disappointment has thwarted my experience over and over again, causing me to become disinterested and to hate the new tier of anime being released. But BRS is a nice start to the year, and I hope more anime will continue to follow it's example.\\n\\n\r\nInteresting characters, diverse plot line, wonderful effects, and a great story, Black Rock Shooter TV has taken my cake. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my second review ever written and this contains solely my opinion, i apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes you may find while reading it.\r\nWow this anime, as i'm scrolling through the reviews it's like 2 different worlds (no pun intended) i see half of people rating it at 1-3 and the other half rating it 9/10. To be fair most reviewers just end up giving it a 5, I guess you could call that neutral, neither a masterpiece nor utter garbage, but i feel the need to give some credit to this anime and am going to state all I think abouteach aspect of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story (6/10)\\n\r\nTo be fair enough i can see the enormous plot holes and missing links through out the story. It's not a very long anime, however it goes goes deeper into the characters, giving each of them a more complex personality as oposed to the OVA where everything's just happening and flying across your screen out of the blue. This story is far more fullfilling than the OVA as it gives us more knowledge about what is going on, who are these Black Rock Shooter, Dead Master, Strength, etc. and it gives us an origin and what they are doing in their world, and finally what is the actual correlation with the real world. The thing i didn't like was that the anime fails to connect the pieces, it kind of follows the same path as the OVA and just throws random new characters in your face, most of them kind of stereotypical and they're just there to fill in the plot and give the main character some obstacle, something to fight against, and it doesn't even make full sense the way the series explains what the fighting is all about and are these girls the only people with these abilities, they just out of nowhere gained them and suddenly can see different worlds? The story was more interesting than the original but i have to give it a 6/10 for the plot holes and just the lack of connection between each event.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art (8/10)\\n\r\nThis is one of the strongest aspects of the series, now i'll have to divide this into 2 categories since half of it is 2D art and the other half is 3D and uses a lot of CGI. As far as the 2D art goes there isn't anything particular, i disliked that they used a lot of dull like colors in the characters not brighter ones but i guess it somewhat fits the atmosphere. The CGI however, this is where this series gets its value, the fighting scenes, the laser beams and pretty much the whole other world or whatever you wish to call it is beautifully designed and i know it takes a lot of work to do it in 3D, each world of each \"girl\" has its uniqueness and it's just amazing to see the visual aspects of each. The combining of the 2D with the 3D makes me give it an 8/10 because i just was thrilled with the 3D visuals even if that doesn't equal the full runtime of  each episode it's pleasing to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound (9/10)\\n\r\nThere's not much to say about the sound i mean the opening theme was obviously the right choice, Hatsune Miku's Black Rock Shooter was a perfect fit and the overall sound effects in each world are fitting as well as during fight scenes, i can't complain much about it so i'll give it a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (6/10)\\n\r\nThis can be argueable but i think the characters are in a way kind of stereotypical, as far as the real world goes the plot can be put simply as: Main female lead which the episodes focus on, best friend who gets jealous easily, best friend's overprotective friend, friend who is hated by others for being friends with the main lead. This is just too typical for me to accept as fine, i don't believe in any way that a situation so stereotypical and usual can lead to such a catastrophe (which is what the anime makes it seem like) which is also the excuse the anime uses as some sort excuse for the existence of the other world. The characters each have different distinct personalities but it's just too typical it doesn't bring anything new to the table. The \"other girls\" in the alternative world don't really have a personality of their own so i can't really judge them. Also i can't give points fo the main lead who seems like a helpless defenseless girl that is dense about everything and can't see what's wrong, just no, enough of these generic characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\r\nNow this might seem like an odd rating for what i just pointed up there, however the anime was enjoyable and watcheable because, first, the fighting scenes are really what made me want to keep going and discover more about the alternative world. I believe the real world adds nothing of value to this anime. I enjoyed discovering more about the black rock shooter world but i felt disapointed they didn't give us more of a story about the actual Black Rock Shooter, Dead Master, etc. the series would have been terrific had they gave us more of that and less of the real world which is just pretty generic i must say. But since it made me want to keep going and not just drop it i'm giving it an 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMy overall score for this anime is a 7/10, plot holes and an uninteresting generic plot of 4 school girls annoyed me the most, the fighting and the action with the use of beautiful visual art and CGI in the alternative world are what i think makes this anime watchable and worth something so i believe it goes above average but it's not a masterpiece, hate me if you want but that is how I see this anime.",

It's another Otaku bait anime that wants to give uskawaii-moe girls in a high school drama for 5 minutes and then have random intense fantasy battle scenes thrown in because we obviously don't have attention spans that can put up with it. According to BRS, if we don't see swords and tits every few minutes, we'd get bored and stop watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is, for this anime. It's true.",

            "content": "Warning: The following is a rewrite of a deleted review from years ago, and contains blacks, rocks, shooters, criticism, profanity and a score below 5/10. Reader discretion is advised.\r\n\u201cMotherfucker\u201d \u2013 Samuel L Jackson.\r\nBlack Rock Shooter has had an interesting rise to prominence, beginning with a mere illustration that spawned into a music video by famous vocaloid persona Hatsune Miku, whose attire was inspired from these illustrations. An OVA was released in 2010 based on the music video, much to the pleasure of many vocaloid fans that caused a ridiculous amount of hype surrounding the project that naturally left a lot to be desired. From therethe franchise created their own line of figurines and a video game before finally returning to anime two years later, putting small-time animation studios Ordet and SANZIGEN in charge of the project to expand the franchise further than ever before, culminating in a TV series composed of 8 episodes in early 2012. Rarely does an anime come to fruition from a tangled background like this, the majority of anime use manga or light novels as source material to base a show around. Because of such, questions are bound to arise about the narrative, characters, structure and other elements in regard to a show when it has such a vague and almost convoluted history like this. Black Rock Shooter is a prime example for why such questions and concern about similar circumstances are justified, by being one of the most peculiar anime I\u2019ve seen, and not in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nThe TV series of Black Rock Shooter focuses primarily on two characters and two worlds. One being the human world where two schoolgirls Mato Kuroi and Yomi Takanashi go about their normal lives and first befriend each other. The alternate world is more of a mystery, coming off as a stylized barren wasteland where the enigmatic fighter known as \u201cBlack Rock Shooter\u201d wanders across the land, fighting for seemingly no other purpose than for her own survival. Unlike the OVA, this series does attempt to show that characters between both worlds are connected, with BRS and other fighters acting as the personas of characters in the real world, providing an intriguing, distinct expression into how characters honestly feel about each other. Unfortunately, the show was unable to capitalize on this at all with the 8 episodes they had from the very start. The first episode gives a couple lines of exposition on the relation between both worlds, which is an improvement from the OVA which had no focus on the topic whatsoever, but this is the only time when said link is ever touched upon. Looking back, it\u2019s kind of pathetic how production didn\u2019t bother to do anymore with this concept considering that Black Rock Shooter is a series that relies on relationships and links, but they did the bare minimum when it came to the most important relationship of all; with the self. Constantly characters are shown to have their own inner conflicts that are expressed through battles within the alternate world, yet there is an ongoing disconnect between these settings that has a damaging effect on these parallel stories as each on their own have nowhere near enough content and focus to stand on their own.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Black Rock Shooter is nothing special; Mato Kuroi has just entered middle school and she is looking for friends, eventually befriending Yomi Takanashi, a shy, aloof girl initially through their shared interest in a picture book. Slowly Yomi becomes more open with Mato as the show goes on until, plot twist, Yomi has another best friend, and she isn\u2019t happy with Yomi talking to other girls! Oh my god, what drama! Honestly, it\u2019s just a silly middle school girl drama that takes itself way too seriously and has no real entertainment value that warrants much attention. At least if it stuck with only focusing on the two main characters, then maybe I wouldn\u2019t have such a problem with the plot, but Black Rock Shooter does not care about being a disjointed mess. After the half-way point the show takes a turn off a cliff as more characters are introduced with little screen time, only to never get a mention again. More \u201cplot-twists\u201d and backstories are added to give the story more shock value that no one cares about at this point, and it all bundles together to form this perplexing piece of work that both insults your intelligence with how simplistic it can get, yet confuses one with so many plot points unanswered to the point where viewers are no longer watching for the plot and only for the action. Which brings us to the alternate world of Black Rock Shooter:\\n\\n\r\nThis setting is a complete change in presentation, showing a vibrant yet desolate realm that is supposed to represent the mentality of middle-school girls; chaotic, turbulent, dangerous where peace among fellow wanderers is not an option. It\u2019s kill or be killed here. All the focus here is action and it is easily the best part of the show. The directing, use of CGI and choreography were all impressive here and a keen eye for detail was present with every battle. Sadly, I would argue these scenes act as a double-edged sword for Black Rock Shooter. On one side, it\u2019s certainly visually impressive and the only parts of the show I would ever recommend watching, but what these scenes do is take away precious time that should have been used to tell the actual story at hand. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the action is second to the main plotline and if the narrative here is rendered to shit because the staff wanted to add more cool action scenes, I don\u2019t see how that makes the show better. All it does is turn the series into one where you can only enjoy if you \u201cturn your brain off\u201d and what makes that any better than looking at a fucking brick wall? It doesn\u2019t help that most of the action scenes are jumbled together with scenes from the human world and ends up clipping the actual story, with horrendous transitioning that makes it all feel worthless. Maybe if they actually put emphasis on how the two worlds correlate, then maybe people would care about what happens in these scenes, but that seems like an impossible scenario considering the staff couldn\u2019t fucking do it right a second time with 3 hours to work with! \\n\\n\r\nBlack Rock Shooter has a very poorly constructed storyline that feels like a case of a show trying to accomplish much more than what time given would allow, but taken to the extreme and doesn\u2019t bother to focus on telling a coherent plot in the process. But as bad as the plot may be, the characters are arguably even worse. These young girls are both simple yet retarded, let me explain. Both main characters are fairly generic, with Mato being an outgoing girl with a strong sense of loyalty and Yomi being an introvert wary of getting close to anyone due to a \u201ctragic past\u201d. The two easily contrast each other and are in no way memorable until they begin showing signs of stupidity that does not match their personalities. The way these two react to everything around them is unnatural; they exaggerate to any problem they face and never try and think about it rationally. Whether it be Mato constantly yelling at every minor problem in her relationship, or Yomi getting the crazy-eye expression one would compare with an anime character about to commit suicide, these two are atrocious when portraying appropriate feelings. This is why I call them retarded; even for teenage girls they come off as incompetent whenever the slightest bit of conflict occurs in either of their lives. The cheesy dialogue does these girls no favours and only further implies that they have mental issues. This is also seen with the underdeveloped characters that are shown for 2 minutes before disappearing from the show, but I found the main leads to be unbearable. For a show that relies on emotions, there was always a feeling of disconnect between what was happening onscreen and what was happening in subtext. And now, after bearing witness to all of their actions, I can easily say that these are two of the most overdramatized lesbian characters I have ever seen; so bad that even the LGBT+ community doesn\u2019t acknowledge them.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, Black Rock Shooter looks like one of the most bland and uninteresting anime in recent memory if you exclude the alternate world. The characters all look sloppy with a sketchy art-style with no identity of its own and some laughable attempts at highlights. The animation here just looks cheap, as if all of the budget when into the action, which barely took about 1/3rd of the series. The lighting was actually commendable when used in the more \u201ctraumatic\u201d scenes, creating a believable aura of uncertainty that helped enhance these moments if only on a technical level, but otherwise it was forgettable and almost absent for the remainder of the show. However, the action scenes are on a whole other level, showcasing some of the best CGI implementation I have seen in an anime and homes some marvellous camerawork and fight composition that makes me wonder why the entire show wasn\u2019t in CGI. When comparing the two diverse art-styles it makes what was hand-drawn look more and more like a piece of shit \u2013 one of the rare cases where an anime has crappy hand-drawn animation with stunning CGI animation. Sound-wise it was fine: voice-acting, soundtrack and audio effects were all passable, except for the opening. The opening was sung by supercell featuring everyone\u2019s favourite vocaloid Hatsune Miku, and while some will definitely enjoy the opening, it\u2019s one that feels out of place with this show, and one that I can easily say is \u201cnot for me.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nBlack Rock Shooter was ultimately another attempt for people to try and make a quick buck off a rising trend, and now that the fad has quietly calmed down I hope that people can see what a pile of utter shit this series it. A successor to a shitty OVA that slightly improves on the material in some ways, only to make the plot even more confusing, characters even more infuriating and an impression on similar works where I expect such to be a complete waste of time. There\u2019s a lot of things I fucking hate about this show, but what really pushes me to the edge is part of the fanbase that find it \u201cd33p\u201d and that if you didn\u2019t like it then you obviously didn\u2019t get it... To anyone who belongs to this group: Trust me, we all got what it was aiming to be, but what actually happened is a different story. We don\u2019t get it? Maybe you don\u2019t get that a show which tries to be an internal character study can also completely fail at it. And with that said, I leave you all with the final verdict.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u201c\u266b\u266b\u266b Black Rock Shooter, where have you gone? \u266b\u266b\u266b\u201d\\n\\n\r\nTO THE HALL OF PAIN BITCH!!!

            "content": "--------------------------------------Head Notes--------------------------------------\r\nBlack Rock Shooter for a viewer who only knows her from images, various cosplays, and that one Miku song... Maybe more, maybe less. I, the person reviewing this am that person. Not a fan, I haven't done any research whatsoever. Just someone who knows that it exists and through curiosity alone decided to start watching in order to find out what all the hype is about.\r\nIn short, I might not know what the hell I am talking about.\r\nPlease enjoy the review.\r\n-------------------------------------The Review----------------------------------------\r\nStory - 5\r\nI really don't know what to say about this. I would say there are two threads of plot. One in thischecker board universe where most of the action happens and one in plain old reality where most of the conceivable story takes place.\\n\\n\r\nMost of it is just dry school drama. The talking becomes so dull and mind melting that I couldn't hold back my long fat groan of frustration. With an obvious obstacle keeping the two main characters from being friends. Some of the things that happen are so ridiculous I find it fucked up and overwhelmingly hilarious at the same time. I can't stop laughing every time I see one of those colored cookies on screen.\\n\\n\r\nThey make some attempts at being dark, but honestly I find it just as dark as Star Wars part three. It blows my mind that some of the characters just don't stand up for themselves like normal characters do and it irritates me to no end to imagine what I would have done if put in that position. These characters don't feel real because they don't do things real people do. In one word, it's unbelievable and you can't get emotionally invested because of it. It sucked so hard I actually got off of it laughing.\\n\\n\r\nThen there are the action sequences. If the other plot thread hasn't beaten you over the head with it's overly conspicuous themes and symbolism, the fight scenes will definitely get the message across. Although they're flashy and something you haven't seen before, that it's all there really is to it. You don't see the point of that separate universe and it just seems like an attempt to snap the view awake for a few minutes of action before they inevitably fall asleep again.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough things get interesting at the end of the second episode. It only leaves me confused and at a loss for words, which means that I don't know what I want from this anime anymore.\\n\\n\r\nOpen endings, viewers making up their own theories.\\n\\n\r\nNo no, stop right there, how about...\\n\\n\r\n\"It didn't make sense to begin with and the only way it is going to is to force it to do so with your overactive imagination.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue that went on inside my head was something similar to\\n\\n\r\n\"Wait! Nothing made sense? That can't be right! Let's explore?\"\\n\\n\r\n\"There's nothing to explore! It's was just crap! Stop complicating things!\"\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\\n\r\nArt was good, fight scenes were blah blah blah, you get it...\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\\n\r\nBeside the theme, which is nice but don't even think is that great, there's nothing memorable at all. Voice acting was average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5\\n\\n\r\nThe decisions they make are unbelievable and it's like a bad itch you can't reach. They fail to develop and you can't really invest anything in anyone. Simply put, they kinda suck.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\\n\r\nAlright, so I got my cheap thrill ride with the fights and was interested in what went down at the second episode, but did it make up for the time I've spent? Was it worth it? Well just barely, I wouldn't spend my time on it if I really didn't have to. It's my pride of dropping as little anime as possible that's keeping me interested in continuing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler Alert below, cause I'm going to rant.\\n\\n\r\nI really hope they stop being so over dramatic, because nobody cares. I don't care if a bitch hands me the ugly colored cookies, cause I'll troll her ass right back. If someone doesn't come to the festival, I go the fuck home. I'd have a nice time doing so too, cause I'd be sucking my candy apple in a pair of sneakers. If someone tries to put a needle on my boobies, I'd slap the shit out of her. If she thinks I have to do everything for her because the retard didn't look both ways before crossing the street and was hit by a plot device, she is out of her natural damn mind. If she decides to jump down the stairs to intentionally to give me grief, I'd tell the retard that the chances of her dying was less than 1 in 2739 (chances of the elderly dying at least). I'd then tell her if she had enough ability to take a roll down the stairs, I'd be more than happy to tell her \"Bitch, make your own food.\" Last of all I'd visit her hospital room, point and laugh at her with her broken wrist going \"Satisfied?\", throw her a goddamn Snicker, tell her to shove it in whichever hole that makes her happy, and leave to go have hot lesbian sex with my new best friend.\\n\\n\r\nGG.",

            "content": "The first time I heard about Black Rock Shooter, it was basically from all the hype in literally every single social media site I visited. The catchy theme song with the opening lines \"Brack Lock Shootah~\" stuck in my head and it was on the top of my \"planning to watch\" list for the longest time. However, this anime was very disappointing.\r\nI'm going to keep it pretty short since this my first review and I don't actually know what I'm doing, but there were several key aspects I feel the anime was missing.\r\nMany people commented on the fact that it had no storyline, and I'lllet them slide there because honestly, many school setting animes lack a storyline or much of it and are still extremely enjoyable and successful. But Black Rock Shooter's storyline was so difficult for me to understand that I had to have at least 4 tabs of the 'black rock shooter wikia' page open while watching the show, almost like having a cheat sheet for a big test.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with that, the anime lacked a basic... Cause and Effect property, if you will. Many characters would have mental break downs and then recover and resume normal behavior 30 seconds later, that doesn't quite make sense. And  as stated by previous reviewers, there was a complete lack of any type of Laws involving Physics, which leaves viewers confused as to the abilities of some characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I find that Black Rock Shooter was a poorly written anime with excellent art and animation, that it was hard to follow, and that there are still some aspects of the anime that I don't and will never understand.",

            "content": "Updated for completing the series. I'll try to keep this as spoiler free as possible\r\nStory 3/10- While all the characters from the OVA are present here, the story itself is nearly completely different.  While I won't spoil anything, I will say that right off the bat BRS and her alternate world is explained within this first episode.  One of the main faults of the OVA was that nothing was really explained at all, so the fact that the audience learns what the hell is going on is an improvement.  However, explaining it all within one episode, in a few lines?  Then,as more and more characters are brought into the story, the 'plot twists' and developments start to feel more and more like silly ass-pulls that come completely out of nowhere. Backstories, especially, seem just like convenient but stupid tie ins. None of it is convincing at all.  I will say that the main concept of the main story isn't that bad, but the way it's told and executed is hilariously bad. The end is also fucking dumb.  With the way it ends, you begin to wonder why they even made the show at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt 2/10 - I can't quite put my finger on it, but something about the way the characters are drawn just feels wrong.  Compared to the OVA, everything seemed to be lacking finesse and polish.  The characters feel sloppily drawn, and the animation is plain cheap.  When combined with the sketch-ish art style , everything looks much worse.  Some of the character shots are literally laughable (Yomi's face when Kagari told her to let her go left me in stitches). Early on I thought the 3D segments were interesting, but as the episodes went on it quickly became dull and just as mediocre as the drawn art.  Even the supposedly high action fight scenes felt half-assed after the first couple episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10 - Not much to say here, other than it was ok.  Voice acting was fine, the effects were ok, and the BGM was ok.  supercell's \"Black Rock Shooter\" as the OP, however, felt so damn out of place.  Now, I may be a bit biased, considering this is one of the few supercell songs that bother me (Miku actually sounds awkward here), but it just kind of came out of no where.  Does not fit the mood of the rest at all.  I really like the ED song as a standalone song, but as the ED to this show, again, it just feels out of place. It's definitely more fitting than BRS as the OP, but still, something is off.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10 - Oh boy.  Where do I begin? The way the characters react to everything that happens is completely unnatural.  None of it feels right.  From Mato completely overreacting to something, to Yomi being such a cliched loner it hurts, to the two's interactions being hilariously close to being yuri, I began to find it hard to take any of it seriously.  The over the top, cheesey dialogue doesn't help, either. More new characters are introduced, and while they make things more interesting for a good 2 minutes, they quickly become as over dramatic and incoherent as Mato and Yomi.  Hell, they're probably even worse than those two.  Also, as new characters are introduced old ones are completely ignored.  Yomi and Kagari are completely forgotten about for a good 3 or 4 episodes, then suddenly come back for the last episode.  It's just a mess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10 -The only reason I finished this show was so I could make fun of it with my friends every week.  It was better to treat this show as some kind of reverse comedy, which I did, rather than a Madoka-style 'little girls breaking down and going crazy.' If you go in taking it completely seriously, you won't finish the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10 - The OVA, despite all its flaws, set a pretty good stage for this.  The series kind of looks at stage, says 'I can improve this!', tries to expand on the already set world, but completely fucks everything up and ends up just stumbling around. There's no way in hell I can honestly recommend this show to anyone.\\n",

It kills confidence, creativity and individuality.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis makes perfect sense once you watch the story.\\n\\n\r\nMy conclusion about the 'Dawn' consultation was to make people sure that there is always help and that no one should be alone in this world.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole story seemed very psychological to me, which is why I gave it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nI don't care so much about art, so let's say it was good\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nNothing too special about the sound, the sound effects in the 'inside' world were well done I'd say. The voice actors did an ok job aswell.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nKuro is a pure hearted girl who cares about people and their feelings, she sadly gets invalidated by Kagari, and makes her confused on her feelings and on why did Kagari have to say such a thing.\\n\\n\r\nKagari was probably suffering herself aswell, and was trying to fight her own feelings by casting them upon other people.\\n\\n\r\nTakanashi's feelings were completely controlled by Kagari and which is why Takanashi was unsure to have Kuro as her friend, and made Kuro think that she also was invalidating her, perfect character trio is made.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI enjoyed Black\u2605Rock Shooter alot, just because of the social complexity it had.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThis anime is worth watching, or at least the first 2 episodes so far.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mari Okada is a writer who is the perfect definition of \"all style, no substance\". I enjoyed her script for Toradora, but everything else she wrote makes me want to throw my monitor out of the window.\r\nFor example, Ano Hana. It took 2/3 of the series to reveal that yes, Menma the ghost is real. Why couldn't she just prove herself instead of acting like a moeblob for the first six episodes? Oh wait, it's bad writing.\r\nShe's basically the Nicholas Sparks of anime. Her only purpose is to make you cry, and when emotions are the main factor behind a story, you know that thereis no room for rational explanations & logic. (And don't give me that \"oh it's anime who cares about logic\" bullcrap. Nanoha and Madoka Magica has alot of rationale in it)\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Mari Okada's a hack and no work of her's define hackery better than Black\u2605Rock Shooter the TV series.\\n\\n\r\nB\u2605RS is originally a music video from a music producer named \"Huke\", which became an OVA created by former KyoAni director Yutaka Yamamoto, also known as \"the saviour of anime\". An anime series for this would be inevitable, especially in an age of Madoka Magica and Penguindrum. Hey, why not cash in on the success of a mahou shoujo franchise by making a TV series with our mahou shoujo franchise, right?\\n\\n\r\nThe story of B\u2605RS TV is almost the same as the OVA, but it does not follow up from the OVA. So prepare to be disappointed if you're expecting a sequel from the OVA.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you're a newcomer to the franchise, it's basically this:\\n\\n\r\nA bunch of middle school kids transcends two worlds: a world of middle school innocence and a world of gunfights and sword battles. These middle school kids have emotional issues, and these emotional issues in one world translates into awesome battles in the other.\\n\\n\r\nSimply to say, it's basically Narutaru and Utena meets the Matrix and Inception. Or something like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are exactly the problems with Mari Okada's writing. I mean, they are the same terrible characters you see in M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening. The main character, Mato Kuroi has some non-existent emotional issues. Hell, she's basically a female Alan Partridge, unable to comprehend the problems of her best friend, Yomi. Yomi, in the other hand is dominated by her awful childhood friend Kagari and her parents are terrible even in Maury Povich/Jeremy Kyle standards. Yomi's mother is a terrible person. Hell, even the worst parent in the world would not be as bad as Yomi's mom. Also, Mato's other friend Yuu can bring her otherworld personality into the real world, whereas their councellor Saya is a crazy bitch.\\n\\n\r\nBut all of this terrible characterisation makes up or amazing battles in the otherworlds, and that makes for amazing visuals and art. Even if you didn't like the main story, but the action is heart-pounding and the otherworld scenes where Mato becomes the Black Rock Shooter is one thing that redeems the bad writing.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing about this series is the sound. Kana Hanazawa is pretty okay as Mato, eventhough i'm sick of her child-like voice. Miyuki Sawashiro is still amazing as Yomi, displaying her range even better this time around. Eri Kitamura as crazy Kagari is not bad either, since she's knwon for playing crazy characters and Kana Asumi keeps that Yuno voice which works for Yuu. But Mamiko Noto is the best seiyuu in this, especially when she's playing something out of her range. A crazy lesbian councellor with the voice of Nogizaka Haruka? Hell yeah.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the OPs and EDs are pretty good. I hate it that both Noitamina shows this season are basically mediocre anime with Supercell and Kana Hanazawa, but i enjoyed this Supercell than the Supercell from Guilty Crown. And Hatsune Miku's voice do work for the OP, because thank God it's a Miku song that utilizes her voice as an advantage.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, B\u2605RS TV is a mediocre series which has lots of good action wrapped around a bad story of terrible writing. You want something good? Go watch Lagrange, Mouretsu Pirates or even Symphogear. Yes, i prefer Symphogear than this.",

            "content": "Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) is an action, science, fantasy and drama anime, which was created by Ordet and Sanzigen studios, with Shinobu Yoshioka as the director and Mari Okada as the lead writer. The anime first aired on February 2nd 2012, finished on March 22nd 2012, and was 8 episodes long. \r\nIn a nutshell.\r\nBlack\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) has a story that centers on the two different worlds that are connected and everything, which happens in the first world, will affect the second. The anime follows the story of Mato Kuoi, a girl who struggles to keep her new friend Yomi Tananashi and Black\u2605Rock Shooter, a mysterious girlin the another world, fighting other beings for an unknown reason. The anime\u2019s mixture of bright and dark art styles and its use of the animation to draw the viewer\u2019s attention, as well as the splendid soundtrack, made the world of Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) real for me. The strong message the show leaves to the viewer, we all feel pain and have our reasons to live on, but if we want to accomplish our aim, we should do it together, is impossible to ignore. I recommend Black Rock Shooter to everyone who is looking for a good; yet, short story; you won\u2019t be disappointed. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot \\n\r\nThe plot of Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) revolves around the two worlds linked together: the first is the human world, where a girl called Mato Kuoi fights for her friendship with Yomi Tananashi, and the other world shows a mysterious girl, called Black\u2605Rock Shooter, fighting other beings in fierce battles for an unknown reason. One thing is certain, there is some kind of a connection between Mato and Black Rock Shooter. Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV)\u2019s story intertwines both worlds, so that negative effects in one are reciprocated in the other. The secrets hidden about each character will entice the viewer into wanting to learn more about what happens to Mato and her new relationship. \\n\\n\r\nNow onto the main characters of Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV): \\n\r\nMato kuroi \u2013 Voiced by Kana Hanazawa (Shiina Mayuri from Steins gate and Tachibana Kanade from Angel Beats) \u2013 She is the main character in the human world and has some form of a connection to Black\u2605Rock Shooter. She plays for a basketball team at her school and is called the First Year Ace by other members of the team for being very skilled at the game. She becomes Yomi\u2019s friend on her first day of school, but someone starts tormenting Mato because of that friendship. \\n\r\nYomi Takanashi \u2013 Voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro (Asada Shino from Sword Art Online II and Hatsuse Izuna from No Game No Life) \u2013 She becomes friends with Mato on her first day at school after moving back from Germany. She is not used to making new friends as her family has been moving around throughout her life. She is a part of the school\u2019s art club, as she is very good at drawing. She gets intimidated by her childhood friend, who has a lot of control over her because of something Yomi believes she did wrong, after she find out about Yomi\u2019s Friendship with Mato. \\n\r\nBlack\u2605Rock Shooter \u2013 Voiced by Kana Hanazawa \u2013 She is the main character of the other world and has some kind of connection to Mato. She carries a rock cannon and a katana, she fights other beings in her world for some mysterious purpose. The message Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) tries to deliver to us is that only we are guilty of our problems and that only we can solve them; however, the majority of people just want to run away or to give up, but with the help and support of the people close to us, we can overcome all difficulties.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation \\n\r\nBlack\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) uses a mixture of very sharp, bright and dark color scheme to attract viewer\u2019s attention, and to present the characters\u2019 pain and struggles they face though out the story. The focus on how the two different worlds are connected, and can affect each other helps to peak the viewer\u2019s interest about the show more. The animation of the characters is very well-made, specially the action scenes, as they show how much time and effort was put in, and it makes them one of best parts of Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV). While Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) is a short anime, its story has depth, which may surprise the viewer, because many short anime don\u2019t have this level of detail, which is a huge achievement of Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV). The voice acting was very well-done, with Kana Hanazawa\u2019s voice of both Mato and Black\u2605Rock Shooter. The soundtrack of the anime is beautiful, the music sounds soft and quiet when scenes take place in the human world, and heavy and fast pace when the action scenes in the other world happen. Finally, with the help of Supercell\u2019s singers Hatusune Miku (Vocaloid and sings the Opening theme) and Koeda (Sings the ending theme), the soundtrack came to life to me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy Opinion \\n\r\nIt is an open secret that short anime don\u2019t receive a good story\u2019s and character\u2019s development; however, Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) proved to me that even a short anime might receive a good development. Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) was able to do that in just 8 episodes and I think that it is a huge achievement. The connection of the characters, along with the blending of the two worlds, made it very interesting to watch as it creatively delivers the main message, \"we all have pains that we want to run away from and most of the time, and we don\u2019t know what to do about them alone.\" Lastly, Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) doesn't do what some shows do, leave the viewer with a cliff-hanger, instead leaves the viewer with an ending that doesn't leave any loose ends.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict \\n\r\nBlack\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) is a hidden gem in anime and has one of the most satisfying stories I have seen in a long time. It shows us that a story doesn't need to be long to be interesting. Throughout the story, Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) describes that everyone around us has pain and struggles in their lives but we must stand up against them and help the each other overcome and accept ourselves. I recommend anyone who loves stories about hardships to give Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) a chance and you won\u2019t feel disappointed.",

This is my opinion, agree or disagree, its up to you which button you press, helpful or not.\r\nBTW this has spoilers\r\nSo, I remember watching the OVA for black rock shooter and I admit it did suck me in. I have high hopes for this series, it has plenty of potential. First of all, I have to say that the artwork is brilliant as is the backround music I've heard. The characters appear to be well done and both main characters interact well, being polar opposites they appear to just fit each other.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on to this other dimension. It is a beautifully drawn place and the mysterious combatants in it add a mystic to it. Why are they fighting you wonder what is the purpose. But then you suddenly notice a correlation between this worlds characters fights and the girls emotions in the real world. Black rock shooter began to lose when her real world equivalent, Kuroi, was in pain. Like the Councillor said, someone takes her pain.\\n\\n\r\nThe designs of the other world characters appear to be metaphors the blond haired girls doll faced killing machine and her real world equivalent doll both were used to hurt our protagonist. That and the other girl, Takanashi, is trapped by the blond haired girl in real life and her weapon appears to be chains\\n\\n\r\nThat's all for now, this anime has buckets of potential, I can only hope it keeps up the current trend.",

            "content": "Black\u2605Rock Shooter is, more or less, an inevitable failure to imitate the dark theme of Mahou Shoujo Madoka x Magica.\r\nStarting off, the first time I saw the trailer of the OVA in Youtube, I was amazed. I really want to watch it. But in the end, after about five months of waiting, I was so disappointed with the OVA. It tried to deliver the story in a very tight yet complex plot--but it failed. Their attempt brought so much plot holes.\r\nNow, there's a new one for the television. I thought it was a hope to revive the title's failure in the OVA but no, itjust failed again. They're still trying to execute the same complex plot that rendered the story incapable of standing by itself. The script does not help either. The characters throw one-liner quotes that don't really help develop the story. The choice of words do not imply what is happening--or perhaps, it's the bad transition between the scenes that made it happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all had this cliche personality (i.e. a klutz, an emo, a super-energetic, etc). Unfortunately, they could not create enough distinction between each character.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound gets crappy at times. They don't escalate the emotion of the characters. It almost feel like it's off-beat for the mood. Most of the times, overly dramatic melodies are played over a very trivial scene--and it just don't work. Seriously.\\n\\n\r\nOn a brighter note, the animation was really good--perhaps, comparable to the of Sunrise's fluid-like animation. But that is all it has to offer. Nothing more.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nSumming up, it's a two thumbs up for Ordet's animation and a two thumbs down for the bad direction and cliche script.\\n\\n\r\n* I haven't proofread my review yet so sorry if there are any grammatical errors. I'll do it as soon as I finished watching the second episode.",

            "content": "Black Rock Shooter is a series I'm only passingly familiar with. Basically, an illustrator named Fuke Ryohei did an illustration that inspired a song that resulted in an OVA that resulted in a game that resulted in several manga, an anime and a whole lot more. That must have been one awesome illustration. In any case, let's take a look at the anime adaptation.\r\nThe story is pretty simple, there are two worlds, one is our ordinary world, the other is a world where our other selves live and shoulder our pain for us... by beating the crap out of each other. The series surrounds amiddle school student named Mato, her interactions with others and how this affects the other world. The concept is interesting, but they really only get in depth with it for half of the series, which amounts to four episodes. The series uses a lot of completely unsubtle colour symbolism, which gets a little annoying. I liked the way they brought the disparate elements together at the end, but it almost felt like they tried to do too much with an eight episode series. This means that some of the plot points aren't very well explained or expanded upon.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are very well done. A lot of the reason for that is the premise. Since the characters emotions are tied to what their other selves are doing, the series has to go in-depth into the characters in order for the other world to make sense. Which, thankfully, they do with skillful illustration rather than forced exposition. To put it in a simpler, albeit somewhat cliche, way they show you instead of telling you. And this leads to some really compelling and sympathetic characters. Even though most of them are middle school girls. I suppose that this could be considered an issue, a lot of what makes the characters interesting is that they don't act like middle school girls except in a few minor ways. Although, as someone who still remembers middle school pretty vividly, I'm glad that they took the route that they did.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's talk about the art. I'm a little torn with this one. The \"real world\" scenes use a bright and cheerful art style similar to Manabi Straight. That's right, the art style that annoys me. They use the same basic style for the features in the other world, but they also do some really spectacular things with the art. The other world has this bizarre, ethereal quality and it looks great. The action scenes also have a unique and interesting look. So, I didn't like the real world art but I did like the other world art. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast does a good job, particularly Hanazawa Kana, it feels like she keeps popping up in the stuff I watch, and Sawashiro Miyuki, there's another familiar name. The music, I did not care for. It's difficult to put exactly what I didn't like about it into words. I suppose that it's the very artificial Vocaloid style a bunch of it uses. I'm not saying that Vocaloid music is inherently bad, in fact I rather like some of it, but given the importance that emotions to the story it feels like a really bizarre and inexplicable style for the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 6/10. Kagari clearly has a thing for Yomi and Mato and Yomi's relationship gets really homo-erotic at several points. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Black Rock Shooter is a 6/10. It's a decent series with interesting ideas even if they could have been handled better. If the premise sounds interesting to you, give it a try. It's only eight episodes so it is a pretty quick watch.",

            "content": "I started watching this anime with high expectations, but I was prepared that it can be worse than I thought. Even then it suprised me badly. Instead of drama-action anime it turned out to be really hard to watch, unlogical, and artifically dramatic piece of junk. Really what was good in it? Pretty other world and opening singed by Hatsune Miku just cannot save something like this from being exactly what I wrote: hard to watch, unlogical and artifically dramatic piece of junk. Characters are acting unrealistically, which is something I really hate since watching School Days. Overall just doesn't make sense. It's just somethingthat tried to be a good drama, but failed monstrually. Also if you read all this and still are going to watch this, I want to warn you: if you have weak nerves, don't do it. Some scenes may be really horroristic for you. Poorly, I'm not able to describe this because of my small english vocabulary, but if you want to know what I mean, try searching for a game \"Alice Madness Returns\". It's similar feeling.\\n\r\nAlso I want to mention why I gave it 9/10 for art. I just liked trick that producers did animating \"real world\" in more tradicional way and specially (I think so) not pretty and animating \"other world\" computer-style, beautifully, full of colors and just pretty. It's just my opinion, this trick will only annoy people that are starting watching anime.\\n\r\nSo this'll be it. Short review of short anime. If you want to check it, just do it. You won't really regret it, it's just a waste of time. I personally wanted to just stop watching it at about episode 5 and finished it just to write this.",

            "content": "I got into the Black\u2605Rock Shooter franchise without any former expectations based on the song by Hatsune Miku (which i enjoy lots, but not particularly the original Miku BRS song) nor the original illustrations, videogame or merchandise. I was embracing a new show, unaware of what was coming, perhaps wondering what sort of quality anything about this brand could possibly have, when this fame was reached through such disperse sorts of media. This perhaps could have made me a little sceptic but i was nontheless very curious, it was all new to me. I was in for a surprise.\r\nSTORY - 9\r\nBorderline 10 rating. One ofthe things that admired me the most about this show was precisely, given that it was limited to 8 episodes and it had enough content to be spread through at the very least 12 episodes, considering the standard pace of most shows these days, it kept dropping in my conscience just how solid and well paced the character development and the situational progress of the events turned out in each episode. How can i explain this, it's as if they managed to keep the show quite fast paced but without feeling rushed at all. It also delivered something that i wasn't very pleased with in the OVA: closure. For those who also already finished watching all 8 episodes AND the OVA, and might disagree with this, i'll put it this way: while the OVA finishes while leaving you hanging with the \"ok, what now??\" question roaming your head, the TV series leave you with a sense that, there will be something beyond this, but you already know what it is and how it will be, you understand the future and the actual story has closure.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nTo justify this high rating, i shall praise this show in 2 different fronts, where it oozed the quality necessary in order to stand out among hundreds of other series. First and foremost, one of the earliest differences between OVA and TV lies in how the characters look like and move in the \"other world\". While the OVA looked great with very interesting coloring, traditional drawing and a rather dynamic however jumpy animation (low cell count?), the TV show won my heart in the most unexpected of ways. In the TV series, the characters in the \"other world\" are rendered in CGI and more often than not, that's a very bad omen for any show, due to the uncanny way 3D character models stand out against everything and everyone else not computer generated. The character CGI in BRS looked to me, both in style as well as in movement dynamics, nearly flawless. Many times it fooled my brain into reconsidering if it wasn't 2D, or perhaps an hybrid, which if it was the case, i shall clap my hands for its seamless way to merge what i would risk saying \"2D meshes on 3D models\". But, go see for yourself, seriously. No, really, do it. Even the movement was extremely fluid and resembled the freedom of traditional animation unlike most 3D models' movements which regularly come paired with clunky/stuck movement. Furthermore, going back into the \"real world\", the characters are 2D and, while they only look good for half of the time we're looking at them (therefore the 9 instead of a 10 rating), i found the detail and expressiveness of these characters to be super effective in conveying their emotions and pulling some reaction from me, of excitement or sadness, etc, everytime there was attention to detail on the characters' facial expressions.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nYes, great. It doesn't have a very memorable soundtrack other than the BRS theme which doesn't count really, because it was already popular out of its own merit (well, to be fair, surely the show will expand on that already estabilished popularity). At various points i couldn't help but become aware of how well the music was being used to enrich several of the core scenes in the story's development, and during certain battles as well (both physical and mental). In terms of sound effects is was equally as competent, delivering some powerful waves especially during some of the battles' most brutal hits.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nI can't say much due to spoilers, but, i will say this: i was impressed how did such a short show even only halfway into it, manage to make me so fond of some of the characters, and really, REALLY, feel glad and sad, and in general, moved with the events that unfolded around them. I consider this quality, a true pearl nowadays, when many shows just can't make you care about even a main character during a supposedly emotion filled peak finale, and then comes something like BRS, that made parts of my body clench in anticipation for the following week's episode, to know what will happen to more characters than just the main protagonist. Each character has a fully explained/revealed past that the viewer learns about in the course of the series and they all have strong motives to drive their intentions, and i believe, the viewer can easily understand all their motives sooner or later, given the smooth way that all the questions are answered (although some questions only get answers on the last 2 episodes or so, making it seem like a confusing story for those who didn't finish it and were expecting the gratification of self explanatory writing contained in isolated episodes that wouldn't dare leave questions hanging with these delicious cliffhangers).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nFully enjoyable, second counting waits between each week, absolute focus on the screen while each and every one of the episodes ran for those 20 minutes, moving characters, interesting story, gripping questions, eyecandy battles. I already know i'll be marathoning the show once it gets a full BluRay release! For a show i had no expectations (good or bad) for, what i found was a rollercoaster of emotions that started off sort of mild on the first episode or two but which escalated intensely with the characters you get to know at a deeper level.",

The other is an over the top school based drama that tries way to hard. You could fast forward through the first 6 episodes and not miss much in terms of plot progression. \r\nArt: 8/10\r\nProbably the only reason I carriedon watching this series was for nicely animated fight scenes happening in the other world. Fast paced action scenes that keeps you entertained. I did notice somewhat of a drop in the animation sequences in the middle but they brought it back up to par in the final 2 episodes. Outside of that the animation is pretty fair. No real complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting and songs used through out the series were good for the most part. Nothing to really criticize nor was there anything that really stood out in terms of quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOh boy...why is everyone in this series seem to be an over dramatic lesbian? The interactions between the characters were so over the top sometimes I would just chuckle and shake my head at what I was witnessing.

            "content": "Firstly, I want to start off by confessing that I was (and still am) a huge fan of Black Rock Shooter before the OVA and the TV series came out. However I will try my best to write this review as if I know nothing about Black Rock Shooter. All good? Awesome, let's go!\r\nStory 7/10 & Characters 7/10\r\nFor me, the weakest areas of this series are the story and characters. The story centers around Mato as she struggles to understand pain and the feelings of hurt, and Black Rock Shooter in an alternate world trying to save others from their pain and suffering by fightingtheir alternate egos. There is depth to the story (mostly apparent in the last few episodes), but the execution of it leaves much to be desired. The last few episodes in particular was very messy, and I had to rewatch them again to fully understand what was going on. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize the characters, we have Mato, a bright and cheery girl who has not really experienced much feelings of pain; Yomi, a quiet girl who has difficulty making friends due to certain circumstances; Kasuga, a girl who is obsessed of never letting go of her friend; Yu, another happy girl who is not who she seems; and the school councellor. Most of the characters are rather bland, with the only standout being Kasuga. However the interaction of the characters and their extreme reactions when they feel the world is crashing down around them was one of the standouts of the series. It created a darker feeling to this series compared to the OVA, and while it can be extreme at times, I can imagine some people in real life will act the same way as well if they were thrown into this situation. You won't like many characters from the get-go, but in a way it is refreshing that an anime series isn't going full throttle to make the audience like every single female character, and allows the viewers to be more subjective rather than taking sides.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation of the fighting scenes is a stand out for the most part. Occasionally something doesn't look quite right with the CG work, but it's only the odd scene or two. The non-CG scenes are also amazing, especially the character's expressions. However I did not really like how young Black Rock Shooter looked, and it was hard to tell what was going on during some of the fast paced action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nI felt that the BGM generally fits each scene very well. I also like the occasional lead into the OP or ED. A standout for me would have to be the way the OP and ED was used in the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nPersonally for me, I felt that this was probably THE standout series of the season, where many other series are more light-hearted or less story driven, and I judge how good a series is based on what else was available that series rather than against all other series I have watched in the past. I was planning to drop this series as I wasn't a big fan of the OVA but decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did in the end.",

            "content": "Black\u2605Rock Shooter would be the last time that I will ever watch with the name Mari Okada in it. I should have learned my lesson with the pile of nonsense Fractale, but nooooo! I JUST HAD to watch this until the end.\r\nOkay, I admit, not all of it was bad. For starters, the use of CGI in this anime was superb. I mean, really. I think BRS established a new standard in me when looking at CGI in anime. The fight scenes were well-made, and the level of violence put in here is nothing to laugh at. BUT, I\u2019m afraid everything else just felt\u2026 ridiculousand pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nI think Mari Okada has a tendency to place unusually large values on topics that don\u2019t really matter and focuses the attention of her writing into creating some of the most angsty anime to ever grace television screens. Fractale had a lot of this that I won\u2019t even bother pointing out. Ano Hana spent too time showing that the character\u2019s couldn\u2019t move on from Menma\u2019s death, as well as OMG IT\u2019S SO SAD LET\u2019S ALL CRY scene from its eleventh episode. BRS had all of this unjustified insanity, characters whose actions don\u2019t make sense, and yes, one of my most hated things about anime, glorifying trivial subjects.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, BRS used insanity very poorly. It\u2019s like asking a fifth grader to write how he thinks insane people act. It\u2019s unnerving, but not quite believable. Let\u2019s take for example Kagari\u2019s behavior. Okay, fine, she was creepy and all that, but I just couldn\u2019t shake off the feeling that there\u2019s something amiss. She felt less like a disturbed person and more like someone feigning insanity to get away with a crime. The same can be said about everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\u2019 actions do not make sense. Why would Yomi\u2019s mother tolerate Kagari\u2019s outrageous behavior toward her own daughter? Why would Saya torture students who weren\u2019t even involved with her problem (Kohata)? How did they know for certain that Mato was BRS, Yomi was DM or Kagari was Chariot? A lot of other questions remain. This is like Fractale all over again.\\n\\n\r\nAs with Ano Hana, I had a lot of trouble trying to sympathize with the events of the story. In the end, the anime ended up being about saving Yuu from the other world. That much is clear. My only problem with this is that the way they did it was so bad. It felt empty. I couldn\u2019t really describe it, but I was so frustrated while I was watching the final episode that I even considered dropping it then and there. It\u2019s the same feeling that I had with Ano Hana. I just don\u2019t like it, and I won\u2019t bother trying to find out why.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think Black Rock Shooter could have been much, much more. All of the flaws I have pointed out can all be traced back to the writing. If this show had a different writer, I think a lot of the problems with this show would not be as frustrating as they had become. Sure, the angst will still be all over the place, but at least it won\u2019t be Mari Okada Angst. I give Black Rock Shooter TV my personal MAL rating of 5, which should have been a 3 if it wasn\u2019t for the cool CGI.",

            "content": "Ahh, Black Rock Shooter\u2026 je t'aime\r\nIn the 1960s, which is 60 years before when I come from which is the future, a recondite avant garde composer by the name of Captain Beefheart graced the airwaves with his trundling avant garde music that challenged the status quo of blues music with a menagerie of outr\u00e9 bumps and scrapes, replete with a healthy dose of guttural growls, vaguely resembling music. Yet these renegade evocative soundscapes informed a portent of society. In order for progress to subsist, artistic vanguards like this are of incorrigible necessity.\r\nNow, I'm going to go on a bit of a tangent here, so pleasebare with me. In comparable fashion, the incandescent, avant garde Dada movement was birthed by way of the antipodal reaction to the indelible horrors of World War Un. This international movement was embarked by a collective of adroit artists and poets consummately associated with the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich. Dada rejected reason and logic, prizing a m\u00e9lange of nonsense, irrationality and intuition. The origin of the name Dada is difficult to parse; some believe that it is a nonsensical word. Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists Tristan Tzara's and Marcel Janco's frequent use of the words da, da, meaning yes, yes in the Romanian language. Another paradigmatic theory states that the nom de plume \"Dada\" came during a confluence of the group when a paper-ladeden knife stuck into a French-German dictionary happened to indicate a sequence of letters spelling out 'dada', a French word for 'hobbyhorse'. Their greatest accomplishment, however, was paving the way for Black Rock Shooter, and in turn, this highly intellectual essay I am writing.\\n\\n\r\nIn the avant garde tradition of dadaism, Black Rock Shooter tells the tale of budding young girls coping with the malaise of growing up by way of nigh-poetic alternative reality battle sequences. These obstreperous alternative reality segments, an oneiric substrate of the recursive subconscious, serve as a brilliantly heuristic amalgam: the asynchronous parallelogram that is the human mind is an esoteric and, at times, untenable beast; one that Black Rock Shooter, in all its thematic opulence, seizes magnanimously, spinning it's own immutable and immaculate web that, while subtly didactic, masterfully explicates the manifold human condition on the precipice of the acquiescence of maturity with a very natural demure about it. In the words of Lester Bangs, \"Every great work of art has two faces, one toward its own time and one toward the future, toward eternity.\" Well played, Mr Bangs. Well played.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you'll bare with me for a bit longer, I'd like to expound upon what a \"character\" is before diving headfirst into Black Rock Shooter's puissant ensemble cast. To cite wikipedia: \"A character is a person in a narrative work of arts (such as a novel, play, television show/series, or film).[1] Derived from the ancient Greek word kharakt\u00ear, the English word dates from theRestoration,[2] although it became widely used after its appearance in Tom Jones in 1749.[3][4] From this, the sense of \"a part played by an actor\" developed.[4] Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the theatre or cinema, involves \"the illusion of being a human person.\"[5] In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes.[6] Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase \"in character\" has been used to describe an effective impersonation by an actor.[4] Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practised by actors or writers, has been called characterisation.[4]\"\\n\\n\r\nThat is what a \"character\" is. Now you \"know\".\\n\\n\r\nTu m'\u00e9tonnes. And the \"characters\", ahh the \"characters\"\u2026!!! So many \"characters\", so many \"feelings\". As I consider it, nigh all of them are connected. In point of fact, the teacher is as well. Mato, a protean Humbert Humbert of sorts, is our intrepid protagonist. Feebly equipoised, Mato is a veritable \"domino theory\" of emotions. Everything from :D to >:O is covered consummately, leaving no stone left unturned, n'est-ce pas! In no other piece of fiction has the kaleidoscopic array of humanity been so thoroughly covered, and with such nuance to boot. Astute viewers will be on the edge of their seat as Mato confronts inherently relatable, quotidian issues, such as being dealt the \"dirty colored macaroons\" by a periphery, recalcitrant acquaintance; clearly a profound yet subtle metaphor for fate and one's lot in life. This essayist is pleased to report that you can expect many more ruminations on life like this promulgated throughout, so please be gently with everyone. Case in point, Black Rock Shooter, Mato's acousm\u00eatre alter ego, is in constant conflict with an elusive, Kafkaesque clout beyond her control; a startling depiction bureaucracy that rivals such notable works as \"1994\" and \"Brave  World\" in its deft, metaphysical illustrations. Furthermore, White Album 2 uses many emotions to bring out emotions. These emotions then show us the emotions of the characters and hence develop them and give us emotions as well while watching this. Veni, vidi, vici.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Rock Shooter truly is a psychologically variegated, ephemeral Musique concr\u00e8te-esque urbane (to coin a neologism) tree-being-chopped-down-when-no-one-is-around-does-anyone-hear-it.!?!. It is a sterling example of anime's edifying artistic potential and stands out sumptuously in the moribund, fetid, meretricious sea of ancillary noxious pabulum that is the anime industry.

            "content": "When watching Black Rock Shooter OAV, I remember seeing the original HUKE mv and thinking, \"Simple. Makes sense.\"\r\nThen the TV came in. I was first of all shocked by all the changes, then I was surprised the story had taken a different turn, and then came the new characters added. What had happened to the original animation I had fallen in love with? There was a bunch of mixed emotions as I had such high expectations. And that was only the first half of the first episode.\r\nAnd then I watched the first one. And then the second. I was literally hooked.\r\nWhy?\r\nFirst of all, for onlythirty minutes of animation, it was well put together! Everything was clear and I didn't have a headache by the end of each episode. I was just ready for the next one. \\n\r\nThe animation helped with that as well. The fights after all, are nothing to over look, the 3D hanging between CGI and 2D. It's entirely too engrossing.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the suspense killed me. What was going to happen? Who was going to do what? The story was so interestingly new and made me want to discover more about it. What was this other world, how did it work and in what ways were these girls truly connected to it? My questions were all answered in a way I was completely satisfied with. So far, nothing has been left out for me that would keep me unable to comprehend the story.\\n\\n\r\nThird, I wanted to say, THIS IS MIDDLE SCHOOL! There's supposed to be DRAMA! And is there Drama! With a capital D! It makes me enjoy the luxuries of being an adult in my own world, because I would never want to grow up as a young girl in the world of BRS! This was especially increased by the latter episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I believe that this anime is one of the more enjoyable art pieces in Japan that I have found over the last few years to watch. Constantly, disappointment has thwarted my experience over and over again, causing me to become disinterested and to hate the new tier of anime being released. But BRS is a nice start to the year, and I hope more anime will continue to follow it's example.\\n\\n\r\nInteresting characters, diverse plot line, wonderful effects, and a great story, Black Rock Shooter TV has taken my cake. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my second review ever written and this contains solely my opinion, i apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes you may find while reading it.\r\nWow this anime, as i'm scrolling through the reviews it's like 2 different worlds (no pun intended) i see half of people rating it at 1-3 and the other half rating it 9/10. To be fair most reviewers just end up giving it a 5, I guess you could call that neutral, neither a masterpiece nor utter garbage, but i feel the need to give some credit to this anime and am going to state all I think abouteach aspect of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story (6/10)\\n\r\nTo be fair enough i can see the enormous plot holes and missing links through out the story. It's not a very long anime, however it goes goes deeper into the characters, giving each of them a more complex personality as oposed to the OVA where everything's just happening and flying across your screen out of the blue. This story is far more fullfilling than the OVA as it gives us more knowledge about what is going on, who are these Black Rock Shooter, Dead Master, Strength, etc. and it gives us an origin and what they are doing in their world, and finally what is the actual correlation with the real world. The thing i didn't like was that the anime fails to connect the pieces, it kind of follows the same path as the OVA and just throws random new characters in your face, most of them kind of stereotypical and they're just there to fill in the plot and give the main character some obstacle, something to fight against, and it doesn't even make full sense the way the series explains what the fighting is all about and are these girls the only people with these abilities, they just out of nowhere gained them and suddenly can see different worlds? The story was more interesting than the original but i have to give it a 6/10 for the plot holes and just the lack of connection between each event.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art (8/10)\\n\r\nThis is one of the strongest aspects of the series, now i'll have to divide this into 2 categories since half of it is 2D art and the other half is 3D and uses a lot of CGI. As far as the 2D art goes there isn't anything particular, i disliked that they used a lot of dull like colors in the characters not brighter ones but i guess it somewhat fits the atmosphere. The CGI however, this is where this series gets its value, the fighting scenes, the laser beams and pretty much the whole other world or whatever you wish to call it is beautifully designed and i know it takes a lot of work to do it in 3D, each world of each \"girl\" has its uniqueness and it's just amazing to see the visual aspects of each. The combining of the 2D with the 3D makes me give it an 8/10 because i just was thrilled with the 3D visuals even if that doesn't equal the full runtime of  each episode it's pleasing to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound (9/10)\\n\r\nThere's not much to say about the sound i mean the opening theme was obviously the right choice, Hatsune Miku's Black Rock Shooter was a perfect fit and the overall sound effects in each world are fitting as well as during fight scenes, i can't complain much about it so i'll give it a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (6/10)\\n\r\nThis can be argueable but i think the characters are in a way kind of stereotypical, as far as the real world goes the plot can be put simply as: Main female lead which the episodes focus on, best friend who gets jealous easily, best friend's overprotective friend, friend who is hated by others for being friends with the main lead. This is just too typical for me to accept as fine, i don't believe in any way that a situation so stereotypical and usual can lead to such a catastrophe (which is what the anime makes it seem like) which is also the excuse the anime uses as some sort excuse for the existence of the other world. The characters each have different distinct personalities but it's just too typical it doesn't bring anything new to the table. The \"other girls\" in the alternative world don't really have a personality of their own so i can't really judge them. Also i can't give points fo the main lead who seems like a helpless defenseless girl that is dense about everything and can't see what's wrong, just no, enough of these generic characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\r\nNow this might seem like an odd rating for what i just pointed up there, however the anime was enjoyable and watcheable because, first, the fighting scenes are really what made me want to keep going and discover more about the alternative world. I believe the real world adds nothing of value to this anime. I enjoyed discovering more about the black rock shooter world but i felt disapointed they didn't give us more of a story about the actual Black Rock Shooter, Dead Master, etc. the series would have been terrific had they gave us more of that and less of the real world which is just pretty generic i must say. But since it made me want to keep going and not just drop it i'm giving it an 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMy overall score for this anime is a 7/10, plot holes and an uninteresting generic plot of 4 school girls annoyed me the most, the fighting and the action with the use of beautiful visual art and CGI in the alternative world are what i think makes this anime watchable and worth something so i believe it goes above average but it's not a masterpiece, hate me if you want but that is how I see this anime.",

Each schoolgirl has each own personality, and each teacher also.

It's another Otaku bait anime that wants to give uskawaii-moe girls in a high school drama for 5 minutes and then have random intense fantasy battle scenes thrown in because we obviously don't have attention spans that can put up with it. According to BRS, if we don't see swords and tits every few minutes, we'd get bored and stop watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is, for this anime. It's true.",

            "content": "Warning: The following is a rewrite of a deleted review from years ago, and contains blacks, rocks, shooters, criticism, profanity and a score below 5/10. Reader discretion is advised.\r\n\u201cMotherfucker\u201d \u2013 Samuel L Jackson.\r\nBlack Rock Shooter has had an interesting rise to prominence, beginning with a mere illustration that spawned into a music video by famous vocaloid persona Hatsune Miku, whose attire was inspired from these illustrations. An OVA was released in 2010 based on the music video, much to the pleasure of many vocaloid fans that caused a ridiculous amount of hype surrounding the project that naturally left a lot to be desired. From therethe franchise created their own line of figurines and a video game before finally returning to anime two years later, putting small-time animation studios Ordet and SANZIGEN in charge of the project to expand the franchise further than ever before, culminating in a TV series composed of 8 episodes in early 2012. Rarely does an anime come to fruition from a tangled background like this, the majority of anime use manga or light novels as source material to base a show around. Because of such, questions are bound to arise about the narrative, characters, structure and other elements in regard to a show when it has such a vague and almost convoluted history like this. Black Rock Shooter is a prime example for why such questions and concern about similar circumstances are justified, by being one of the most peculiar anime I\u2019ve seen, and not in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nThe TV series of Black Rock Shooter focuses primarily on two characters and two worlds. One being the human world where two schoolgirls Mato Kuroi and Yomi Takanashi go about their normal lives and first befriend each other. The alternate world is more of a mystery, coming off as a stylized barren wasteland where the enigmatic fighter known as \u201cBlack Rock Shooter\u201d wanders across the land, fighting for seemingly no other purpose than for her own survival. Unlike the OVA, this series does attempt to show that characters between both worlds are connected, with BRS and other fighters acting as the personas of characters in the real world, providing an intriguing, distinct expression into how characters honestly feel about each other. Unfortunately, the show was unable to capitalize on this at all with the 8 episodes they had from the very start. The first episode gives a couple lines of exposition on the relation between both worlds, which is an improvement from the OVA which had no focus on the topic whatsoever, but this is the only time when said link is ever touched upon. Looking back, it\u2019s kind of pathetic how production didn\u2019t bother to do anymore with this concept considering that Black Rock Shooter is a series that relies on relationships and links, but they did the bare minimum when it came to the most important relationship of all; with the self. Constantly characters are shown to have their own inner conflicts that are expressed through battles within the alternate world, yet there is an ongoing disconnect between these settings that has a damaging effect on these parallel stories as each on their own have nowhere near enough content and focus to stand on their own.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Black Rock Shooter is nothing special; Mato Kuroi has just entered middle school and she is looking for friends, eventually befriending Yomi Takanashi, a shy, aloof girl initially through their shared interest in a picture book. Slowly Yomi becomes more open with Mato as the show goes on until, plot twist, Yomi has another best friend, and she isn\u2019t happy with Yomi talking to other girls! Oh my god, what drama! Honestly, it\u2019s just a silly middle school girl drama that takes itself way too seriously and has no real entertainment value that warrants much attention. At least if it stuck with only focusing on the two main characters, then maybe I wouldn\u2019t have such a problem with the plot, but Black Rock Shooter does not care about being a disjointed mess. After the half-way point the show takes a turn off a cliff as more characters are introduced with little screen time, only to never get a mention again. More \u201cplot-twists\u201d and backstories are added to give the story more shock value that no one cares about at this point, and it all bundles together to form this perplexing piece of work that both insults your intelligence with how simplistic it can get, yet confuses one with so many plot points unanswered to the point where viewers are no longer watching for the plot and only for the action. Which brings us to the alternate world of Black Rock Shooter:\\n\\n\r\nThis setting is a complete change in presentation, showing a vibrant yet desolate realm that is supposed to represent the mentality of middle-school girls; chaotic, turbulent, dangerous where peace among fellow wanderers is not an option. It\u2019s kill or be killed here. All the focus here is action and it is easily the best part of the show. The directing, use of CGI and choreography were all impressive here and a keen eye for detail was present with every battle. Sadly, I would argue these scenes act as a double-edged sword for Black Rock Shooter. On one side, it\u2019s certainly visually impressive and the only parts of the show I would ever recommend watching, but what these scenes do is take away precious time that should have been used to tell the actual story at hand. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the action is second to the main plotline and if the narrative here is rendered to shit because the staff wanted to add more cool action scenes, I don\u2019t see how that makes the show better. All it does is turn the series into one where you can only enjoy if you \u201cturn your brain off\u201d and what makes that any better than looking at a fucking brick wall? It doesn\u2019t help that most of the action scenes are jumbled together with scenes from the human world and ends up clipping the actual story, with horrendous transitioning that makes it all feel worthless. Maybe if they actually put emphasis on how the two worlds correlate, then maybe people would care about what happens in these scenes, but that seems like an impossible scenario considering the staff couldn\u2019t fucking do it right a second time with 3 hours to work with! \\n\\n\r\nBlack Rock Shooter has a very poorly constructed storyline that feels like a case of a show trying to accomplish much more than what time given would allow, but taken to the extreme and doesn\u2019t bother to focus on telling a coherent plot in the process. But as bad as the plot may be, the characters are arguably even worse. These young girls are both simple yet retarded, let me explain. Both main characters are fairly generic, with Mato being an outgoing girl with a strong sense of loyalty and Yomi being an introvert wary of getting close to anyone due to a \u201ctragic past\u201d. The two easily contrast each other and are in no way memorable until they begin showing signs of stupidity that does not match their personalities. The way these two react to everything around them is unnatural; they exaggerate to any problem they face and never try and think about it rationally. Whether it be Mato constantly yelling at every minor problem in her relationship, or Yomi getting the crazy-eye expression one would compare with an anime character about to commit suicide, these two are atrocious when portraying appropriate feelings. This is why I call them retarded; even for teenage girls they come off as incompetent whenever the slightest bit of conflict occurs in either of their lives. The cheesy dialogue does these girls no favours and only further implies that they have mental issues. This is also seen with the underdeveloped characters that are shown for 2 minutes before disappearing from the show, but I found the main leads to be unbearable. For a show that relies on emotions, there was always a feeling of disconnect between what was happening onscreen and what was happening in subtext. And now, after bearing witness to all of their actions, I can easily say that these are two of the most overdramatized lesbian characters I have ever seen; so bad that even the LGBT+ community doesn\u2019t acknowledge them.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, Black Rock Shooter looks like one of the most bland and uninteresting anime in recent memory if you exclude the alternate world. The characters all look sloppy with a sketchy art-style with no identity of its own and some laughable attempts at highlights. The animation here just looks cheap, as if all of the budget when into the action, which barely took about 1/3rd of the series. The lighting was actually commendable when used in the more \u201ctraumatic\u201d scenes, creating a believable aura of uncertainty that helped enhance these moments if only on a technical level, but otherwise it was forgettable and almost absent for the remainder of the show. However, the action scenes are on a whole other level, showcasing some of the best CGI implementation I have seen in an anime and homes some marvellous camerawork and fight composition that makes me wonder why the entire show wasn\u2019t in CGI. When comparing the two diverse art-styles it makes what was hand-drawn look more and more like a piece of shit \u2013 one of the rare cases where an anime has crappy hand-drawn animation with stunning CGI animation. Sound-wise it was fine: voice-acting, soundtrack and audio effects were all passable, except for the opening. The opening was sung by supercell featuring everyone\u2019s favourite vocaloid Hatsune Miku, and while some will definitely enjoy the opening, it\u2019s one that feels out of place with this show, and one that I can easily say is \u201cnot for me.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nBlack Rock Shooter was ultimately another attempt for people to try and make a quick buck off a rising trend, and now that the fad has quietly calmed down I hope that people can see what a pile of utter shit this series it. A successor to a shitty OVA that slightly improves on the material in some ways, only to make the plot even more confusing, characters even more infuriating and an impression on similar works where I expect such to be a complete waste of time. There\u2019s a lot of things I fucking hate about this show, but what really pushes me to the edge is part of the fanbase that find it \u201cd33p\u201d and that if you didn\u2019t like it then you obviously didn\u2019t get it... To anyone who belongs to this group: Trust me, we all got what it was aiming to be, but what actually happened is a different story. We don\u2019t get it? Maybe you don\u2019t get that a show which tries to be an internal character study can also completely fail at it. And with that said, I leave you all with the final verdict.\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u201c\u266b\u266b\u266b Black Rock Shooter, where have you gone? \u266b\u266b\u266b\u201d\\n\\n\r\nTO THE HALL OF PAIN BITCH!!! REST\u2026.. IN\u2026\u2026 PISS!!!!\\n",

            "content": "--------------------------------------Head Notes--------------------------------------\r\nBlack Rock Shooter for a viewer who only knows her from images, various cosplays, and that one Miku song... Maybe more, maybe less. I, the person reviewing this am that person. Not a fan, I haven't done any research whatsoever. Just someone who knows that it exists and through curiosity alone decided to start watching in order to find out what all the hype is about.\r\nIn short, I might not know what the hell I am talking about.\r\nPlease enjoy the review.\r\n-------------------------------------The Review----------------------------------------\r\nStory - 5\r\nI really don't know what to say about this. I would say there are two threads of plot. One in thischecker board universe where most of the action happens and one in plain old reality where most of the conceivable story takes place.\\n\\n\r\nMost of it is just dry school drama. The talking becomes so dull and mind melting that I couldn't hold back my long fat groan of frustration. With an obvious obstacle keeping the two main characters from being friends. Some of the things that happen are so ridiculous I find it fucked up and overwhelmingly hilarious at the same time. I can't stop laughing every time I see one of those colored cookies on screen.\\n\\n\r\nThey make some attempts at being dark, but honestly I find it just as dark as Star Wars part three. It blows my mind that some of the characters just don't stand up for themselves like normal characters do and it irritates me to no end to imagine what I would have done if put in that position. These characters don't feel real because they don't do things real people do. In one word, it's unbelievable and you can't get emotionally invested because of it. It sucked so hard I actually got off of it laughing.\\n\\n\r\nThen there are the action sequences. If the other plot thread hasn't beaten you over the head with it's overly conspicuous themes and symbolism, the fight scenes will definitely get the message across. Although they're flashy and something you haven't seen before, that it's all there really is to it. You don't see the point of that separate universe and it just seems like an attempt to snap the view awake for a few minutes of action before they inevitably fall asleep again.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough things get interesting at the end of the second episode. It only leaves me confused and at a loss for words, which means that I don't know what I want from this anime anymore.\\n\\n\r\nOpen endings, viewers making up their own theories.\\n\\n\r\nNo no, stop right there, how about...\\n\\n\r\n\"It didn't make sense to begin with and the only way it is going to is to force it to do so with your overactive imagination.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue that went on inside my head was something similar to\\n\\n\r\n\"Wait! Nothing made sense? That can't be right! Let's explore?\"\\n\\n\r\n\"There's nothing to explore! It's was just crap! Stop complicating things!\"\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\\n\r\nArt was good, fight scenes were blah blah blah, you get it...\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\\n\r\nBeside the theme, which is nice but don't even think is that great, there's nothing memorable at all. Voice acting was average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5\\n\\n\r\nThe decisions they make are unbelievable and it's like a bad itch you can't reach. They fail to develop and you can't really invest anything in anyone. Simply put, they kinda suck.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\\n\r\nAlright, so I got my cheap thrill ride with the fights and was interested in what went down at the second episode, but did it make up for the time I've spent? Was it worth it? Well just barely, I wouldn't spend my time on it if I really didn't have to. It's my pride of dropping as little anime as possible that's keeping me interested in continuing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler Alert below, cause I'm going to rant.\\n\\n\r\nI really hope they stop being so over dramatic, because nobody cares. I don't care if a bitch hands me the ugly colored cookies, cause I'll troll her ass right back. If someone doesn't come to the festival, I go the fuck home. I'd have a nice time doing so too, cause I'd be sucking my candy apple in a pair of sneakers. If someone tries to put a needle on my boobies, I'd slap the shit out of her. If she thinks I have to do everything for her because the retard didn't look both ways before crossing the street and was hit by a plot device, she is out of her natural damn mind. If she decides to jump down the stairs to intentionally to give me grief, I'd tell the retard that the chances of her dying was less than 1 in 2739 (chances of the elderly dying at least). I'd then tell her if she had enough ability to take a roll down the stairs, I'd be more than happy to tell her \"Bitch, make your own food.\" Last of all I'd visit her hospital room, point and laugh at her with her broken wrist going \"Satisfied?\", throw her a goddamn Snicker, tell her to shove it in whichever hole that makes her happy, and leave to go have hot lesbian sex with my new best friend.\\n\\n\r\nGG.",

            "content": "The first time I heard about Black Rock Shooter, it was basically from all the hype in literally every single social media site I visited. The catchy theme song with the opening lines \"Brack Lock Shootah~\" stuck in my head and it was on the top of my \"planning to watch\" list for the longest time. However, this anime was very disappointing.\r\nI'm going to keep it pretty short since this my first review and I don't actually know what I'm doing, but there were several key aspects I feel the anime was missing.\r\nMany people commented on the fact that it had no storyline, and I'lllet them slide there because honestly, many school setting animes lack a storyline or much of it and are still extremely enjoyable and successful. But Black Rock Shooter's storyline was so difficult for me to understand that I had to have at least 4 tabs of the 'black rock shooter wikia' page open while watching the show, almost like having a cheat sheet for a big test.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with that, the anime lacked a basic... Cause and Effect property, if you will. Many characters would have mental break downs and then recover and resume normal behavior 30 seconds later, that doesn't quite make sense. And  as stated by previous reviewers, there was a complete lack of any type of Laws involving Physics, which leaves viewers confused as to the abilities of some characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I find that Black Rock Shooter was a poorly written anime with excellent art and animation, that it was hard to follow, and that there are still some aspects of the anime that I don't and will never understand.",

            "content": "Updated for completing the series. I'll try to keep this as spoiler free as possible\r\nStory 3/10- While all the characters from the OVA are present here, the story itself is nearly completely different.  While I won't spoil anything, I will say that right off the bat BRS and her alternate world is explained within this first episode.  One of the main faults of the OVA was that nothing was really explained at all, so the fact that the audience learns what the hell is going on is an improvement.  However, explaining it all within one episode, in a few lines?  Then,as more and more characters are brought into the story, the 'plot twists' and developments start to feel more and more like silly ass-pulls that come completely out of nowhere. Backstories, especially, seem just like convenient but stupid tie ins. None of it is convincing at all.  I will say that the main concept of the main story isn't that bad, but the way it's told and executed is hilariously bad. The end is also fucking dumb.  With the way it ends, you begin to wonder why they even made the show at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt 2/10 - I can't quite put my finger on it, but something about the way the characters are drawn just feels wrong.  Compared to the OVA, everything seemed to be lacking finesse and polish.  The characters feel sloppily drawn, and the animation is plain cheap.  When combined with the sketch-ish art style , everything looks much worse.  Some of the character shots are literally laughable (Yomi's face when Kagari told her to let her go left me in stitches). Early on I thought the 3D segments were interesting, but as the episodes went on it quickly became dull and just as mediocre as the drawn art.  Even the supposedly high action fight scenes felt half-assed after the first couple episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10 - Not much to say here, other than it was ok.  Voice acting was fine, the effects were ok, and the BGM was ok.  supercell's \"Black Rock Shooter\" as the OP, however, felt so damn out of place.  Now, I may be a bit biased, considering this is one of the few supercell songs that bother me (Miku actually sounds awkward here), but it just kind of came out of no where.  Does not fit the mood of the rest at all.  I really like the ED song as a standalone song, but as the ED to this show, again, it just feels out of place. It's definitely more fitting than BRS as the OP, but still, something is off.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10 - Oh boy.  Where do I begin? The way the characters react to everything that happens is completely unnatural.  None of it feels right.  From Mato completely overreacting to something, to Yomi being such a cliched loner it hurts, to the two's interactions being hilariously close to being yuri, I began to find it hard to take any of it seriously.  The over the top, cheesey dialogue doesn't help, either. More new characters are introduced, and while they make things more interesting for a good 2 minutes, they quickly become as over dramatic and incoherent as Mato and Yomi.  Hell, they're probably even worse than those two.  Also, as new characters are introduced old ones are completely ignored.  Yomi and Kagari are completely forgotten about for a good 3 or 4 episodes, then suddenly come back for the last episode.  It's just a mess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10 -The only reason I finished this show was so I could make fun of it with my friends every week.  It was better to treat this show as some kind of reverse comedy, which I did, rather than a Madoka-style 'little girls breaking down and going crazy.' If you go in taking it completely seriously, you won't finish the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10 - The OVA, despite all its flaws, set a pretty good stage for this.  The series kind of looks at stage, says 'I can improve this!', tries to expand on the already set world, but completely fucks everything up and ends up just stumbling around. There's no way in hell I can honestly recommend this show to anyone.\\n",

            "content": "Okay... this is my first review, but I thought of doing this, since people don't seem to understand what this anime was about, since the anime itself seemed actually very psychological, or at least that's what it felt like to me.\r\nthese are my personal feelings about the anime so far, please be aware of that\r\nStory: 9\r\nStory was great, it felt to me, that it was built to tell about human's emotional suffering, and how social invalidation can turn us into doubting our own feelings, and making us feel isolated.\r\n\"Invalidation is to reject, ignore, mock, tease, judge, or diminish someone's feelings. It is an attempt tocontrol how they feel and for how long they feel it.\"\\n\r\n\"Psychological invalidation is one of the most lethal forms of emotional abuse. It kills confidence, creativity and individuality.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis makes perfect sense once you watch the story.\\n\\n\r\nMy conclusion about the 'Dawn' consultation was to make people sure that there is always help and that no one should be alone in this world.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole story seemed very psychological to me, which is why I gave it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nI don't care so much about art, so let's say it was good\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nNothing too special about the sound, the sound effects in the 'inside' world were well done I'd say. The voice actors did an ok job aswell.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nKuro is a pure hearted girl who cares about people and their feelings, she sadly gets invalidated by Kagari, and makes her confused on her feelings and on why did Kagari have to say such a thing.\\n\\n\r\nKagari was probably suffering herself aswell, and was trying to fight her own feelings by casting them upon other people.\\n\\n\r\nTakanashi's feelings were completely controlled by Kagari and which is why Takanashi was unsure to have Kuro as her friend, and made Kuro think that she also was invalidating her, perfect character trio is made.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI enjoyed Black\u2605Rock Shooter alot, just because of the social complexity it had.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThis anime is worth watching, or at least the first 2 episodes so far.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mari Okada is a writer who is the perfect definition of \"all style, no substance\". I enjoyed her script for Toradora, but everything else she wrote makes me want to throw my monitor out of the window.\r\nFor example, Ano Hana. It took 2/3 of the series to reveal that yes, Menma the ghost is real. Why couldn't she just prove herself instead of acting like a moeblob for the first six episodes? Oh wait, it's bad writing.\r\nShe's basically the Nicholas Sparks of anime. Her only purpose is to make you cry, and when emotions are the main factor behind a story, you know that thereis no room for rational explanations & logic. (And don't give me that \"oh it's anime who cares about logic\" bullcrap. Nanoha and Madoka Magica has alot of rationale in it)\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Mari Okada's a hack and no work of her's define hackery better than Black\u2605Rock Shooter the TV series.\\n\\n\r\nB\u2605RS is originally a music video from a music producer named \"Huke\", which became an OVA created by former KyoAni director Yutaka Yamamoto, also known as \"the saviour of anime\". An anime series for this would be inevitable, especially in an age of Madoka Magica and Penguindrum. Hey, why not cash in on the success of a mahou shoujo franchise by making a TV series with our mahou shoujo franchise, right?\\n\\n\r\nThe story of B\u2605RS TV is almost the same as the OVA, but it does not follow up from the OVA. So prepare to be disappointed if you're expecting a sequel from the OVA.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you're a newcomer to the franchise, it's basically this:\\n\\n\r\nA bunch of middle school kids transcends two worlds: a world of middle school innocence and a world of gunfights and sword battles. These middle school kids have emotional issues, and these emotional issues in one world translates into awesome battles in the other.\\n\\n\r\nSimply to say, it's basically Narutaru and Utena meets the Matrix and Inception. Or something like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are exactly the problems with Mari Okada's writing. I mean, they are the same terrible characters you see in M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening. The main character, Mato Kuroi has some non-existent emotional issues. Hell, she's basically a female Alan Partridge, unable to comprehend the problems of her best friend, Yomi. Yomi, in the other hand is dominated by her awful childhood friend Kagari and her parents are terrible even in Maury Povich/Jeremy Kyle standards. Yomi's mother is a terrible person. Hell, even the worst parent in the world would not be as bad as Yomi's mom. Also, Mato's other friend Yuu can bring her otherworld personality into the real world, whereas their councellor Saya is a crazy bitch.\\n\\n\r\nBut all of this terrible characterisation makes up or amazing battles in the otherworlds, and that makes for amazing visuals and art. Even if you didn't like the main story, but the action is heart-pounding and the otherworld scenes where Mato becomes the Black Rock Shooter is one thing that redeems the bad writing.\\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing about this series is the sound. Kana Hanazawa is pretty okay as Mato, eventhough i'm sick of her child-like voice. Miyuki Sawashiro is still amazing as Yomi, displaying her range even better this time around. Eri Kitamura as crazy Kagari is not bad either, since she's knwon for playing crazy characters and Kana Asumi keeps that Yuno voice which works for Yuu. But Mamiko Noto is the best seiyuu in this, especially when she's playing something out of her range. A crazy lesbian councellor with the voice of Nogizaka Haruka? Hell yeah.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the OPs and EDs are pretty good. I hate it that both Noitamina shows this season are basically mediocre anime with Supercell and Kana Hanazawa, but i enjoyed this Supercell than the Supercell from Guilty Crown. And Hatsune Miku's voice do work for the OP, because thank God it's a Miku song that utilizes her voice as an advantage.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, B\u2605RS TV is a mediocre series which has lots of good action wrapped around a bad story of terrible writing. You want something good? Go watch Lagrange, Mouretsu Pirates or even Symphogear. Yes, i prefer Symphogear than this.",

The anime first aired on February 2nd 2012, finished on March 22nd 2012, and was 8 episodes long. \r\nIn a nutshell.\r\nBlack\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) has a story that centers on the two different worlds that are connected and everything, which happens in the first world, will affect the second. The anime follows the story of Mato Kuoi, a girl who struggles to keep her new friend Yomi Tananashi and Black\u2605Rock Shooter, a mysterious girlin the another world, fighting other beings for an unknown reason. The anime\u2019s mixture of bright and dark art styles and its use of the animation to draw the viewer\u2019s attention, as well as the splendid soundtrack, made the world of Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) real for me. The strong message the show leaves to the viewer, we all feel pain and have our reasons to live on, but if we want to accomplish our aim, we should do it together, is impossible to ignore. I recommend Black Rock Shooter to everyone who is looking for a good; yet, short story; you won\u2019t be disappointed. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot \\n\r\nThe plot of Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) revolves around the two worlds linked together: the first is the human world, where a girl called Mato Kuoi fights for her friendship with Yomi Tananashi, and the other world shows a mysterious girl, called Black\u2605Rock Shooter, fighting other beings in fierce battles for an unknown reason. One thing is certain, there is some kind of a connection between Mato and Black Rock Shooter. Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV)\u2019s story intertwines both worlds, so that negative effects in one are reciprocated in the other. The secrets hidden about each character will entice the viewer into wanting to learn more about what happens to Mato and her new relationship. \\n\\n\r\nNow onto the main characters of Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV): \\n\r\nMato kuroi \u2013 Voiced by Kana Hanazawa (Shiina Mayuri from Steins gate and Tachibana Kanade from Angel Beats) \u2013 She is the main character in the human world and has some form of a connection to Black\u2605Rock Shooter. She plays for a basketball team at her school and is called the First Year Ace by other members of the team for being very skilled at the game. She becomes Yomi\u2019s friend on her first day of school, but someone starts tormenting Mato because of that friendship. \\n\r\nYomi Takanashi \u2013 Voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro (Asada Shino from Sword Art Online II and Hatsuse Izuna from No Game No Life) \u2013 She becomes friends with Mato on her first day at school after moving back from Germany. She is not used to making new friends as her family has been moving around throughout her life. She is a part of the school\u2019s art club, as she is very good at drawing. She gets intimidated by her childhood friend, who has a lot of control over her because of something Yomi believes she did wrong, after she find out about Yomi\u2019s Friendship with Mato. \\n\r\nBlack\u2605Rock Shooter \u2013 Voiced by Kana Hanazawa \u2013 She is the main character of the other world and has some kind of connection to Mato. She carries a rock cannon and a katana, she fights other beings in her world for some mysterious purpose. The message Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) tries to deliver to us is that only we are guilty of our problems and that only we can solve them; however, the majority of people just want to run away or to give up, but with the help and support of the people close to us, we can overcome all difficulties.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation \\n\r\nBlack\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) uses a mixture of very sharp, bright and dark color scheme to attract viewer\u2019s attention, and to present the characters\u2019 pain and struggles they face though out the story. The focus on how the two different worlds are connected, and can affect each other helps to peak the viewer\u2019s interest about the show more. The animation of the characters is very well-made, specially the action scenes, as they show how much time and effort was put in, and it makes them one of best parts of Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV). While Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) is a short anime, its story has depth, which may surprise the viewer, because many short anime don\u2019t have this level of detail, which is a huge achievement of Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV). The voice acting was very well-done, with Kana Hanazawa\u2019s voice of both Mato and Black\u2605Rock Shooter. The soundtrack of the anime is beautiful, the music sounds soft and quiet when scenes take place in the human world, and heavy and fast pace when the action scenes in the other world happen. Finally, with the help of Supercell\u2019s singers Hatusune Miku (Vocaloid and sings the Opening theme) and Koeda (Sings the ending theme), the soundtrack came to life to me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy Opinion \\n\r\nIt is an open secret that short anime don\u2019t receive a good story\u2019s and character\u2019s development; however, Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) proved to me that even a short anime might receive a good development. Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) was able to do that in just 8 episodes and I think that it is a huge achievement. The connection of the characters, along with the blending of the two worlds, made it very interesting to watch as it creatively delivers the main message, \"we all have pains that we want to run away from and most of the time, and we don\u2019t know what to do about them alone.\" Lastly, Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) doesn't do what some shows do, leave the viewer with a cliff-hanger, instead leaves the viewer with an ending that doesn't leave any loose ends.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict \\n\r\nBlack\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) is a hidden gem in anime and has one of the most satisfying stories I have seen in a long time. It shows us that a story doesn't need to be long to be interesting. Throughout the story, Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) describes that everyone around us has pain and struggles in their lives but we must stand up against them and help the each other overcome and accept ourselves. I recommend anyone who loves stories about hardships to give Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) a chance and you won\u2019t feel disappointed.",

This is my opinion, agree or disagree, its up to you which button you press, helpful or not.\r\nBTW this has spoilers\r\nSo, I remember watching the OVA for black rock shooter and I admit it did suck me in. I have high hopes for this series, it has plenty of potential. First of all, I have to say that the artwork is brilliant as is the backround music I've heard. The characters appear to be well done and both main characters interact well, being polar opposites they appear to just fit each other.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on to this other dimension. It is a beautifully drawn place and the mysterious combatants in it add a mystic to it. Why are they fighting you wonder what is the purpose. But then you suddenly notice a correlation between this worlds characters fights and the girls emotions in the real world. Black rock shooter began to lose when her real world equivalent, Kuroi, was in pain. Like the Councillor said, someone takes her pain.\\n\\n\r\nThe designs of the other world characters appear to be metaphors the blond haired girls doll faced killing machine and her real world equivalent doll both were used to hurt our protagonist. That and the other girl, Takanashi, is trapped by the blond haired girl in real life and her weapon appears to be chains\\n\\n\r\nThat's all for now, this anime has buckets of potential, I can only hope it keeps up the current trend.",

            "content": "Black\u2605Rock Shooter is, more or less, an inevitable failure to imitate the dark theme of Mahou Shoujo Madoka x Magica.\r\nStarting off, the first time I saw the trailer of the OVA in Youtube, I was amazed. I really want to watch it. But in the end, after about five months of waiting, I was so disappointed with the OVA. It tried to deliver the story in a very tight yet complex plot--but it failed. Their attempt brought so much plot holes.\r\nNow, there's a new one for the television. I thought it was a hope to revive the title's failure in the OVA but no, itjust failed again. They're still trying to execute the same complex plot that rendered the story incapable of standing by itself. The script does not help either. The characters throw one-liner quotes that don't really help develop the story. The choice of words do not imply what is happening--or perhaps, it's the bad transition between the scenes that made it happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all had this cliche personality (i.e. a klutz, an emo, a super-energetic, etc). Unfortunately, they could not create enough distinction between each character.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound gets crappy at times. They don't escalate the emotion of the characters. It almost feel like it's off-beat for the mood. Most of the times, overly dramatic melodies are played over a very trivial scene--and it just don't work. Seriously.\\n\\n\r\nOn a brighter note, the animation was really good--perhaps, comparable to the of Sunrise's fluid-like animation. But that is all it has to offer. Nothing more.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nSumming up, it's a two thumbs up for Ordet's animation and a two thumbs down for the bad direction and cliche script.\\n\\n\r\n* I haven't proofread my review yet so sorry if there are any grammatical errors. I'll do it as soon as I finished watching the second episode.",

            "content": "Black Rock Shooter is a series I'm only passingly familiar with. Basically, an illustrator named Fuke Ryohei did an illustration that inspired a song that resulted in an OVA that resulted in a game that resulted in several manga, an anime and a whole lot more. That must have been one awesome illustration. In any case, let's take a look at the anime adaptation.\r\nThe story is pretty simple, there are two worlds, one is our ordinary world, the other is a world where our other selves live and shoulder our pain for us... by beating the crap out of each other. The series surrounds amiddle school student named Mato, her interactions with others and how this affects the other world. The concept is interesting, but they really only get in depth with it for half of the series, which amounts to four episodes. The series uses a lot of completely unsubtle colour symbolism, which gets a little annoying. I liked the way they brought the disparate elements together at the end, but it almost felt like they tried to do too much with an eight episode series. This means that some of the plot points aren't very well explained or expanded upon.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are very well done. A lot of the reason for that is the premise. Since the characters emotions are tied to what their other selves are doing, the series has to go in-depth into the characters in order for the other world to make sense. Which, thankfully, they do with skillful illustration rather than forced exposition. To put it in a simpler, albeit somewhat cliche, way they show you instead of telling you. And this leads to some really compelling and sympathetic characters. Even though most of them are middle school girls. I suppose that this could be considered an issue, a lot of what makes the characters interesting is that they don't act like middle school girls except in a few minor ways. Although, as someone who still remembers middle school pretty vividly, I'm glad that they took the route that they did.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's talk about the art. I'm a little torn with this one. The \"real world\" scenes use a bright and cheerful art style similar to Manabi Straight. That's right, the art style that annoys me. They use the same basic style for the features in the other world, but they also do some really spectacular things with the art. The other world has this bizarre, ethereal quality and it looks great. The action scenes also have a unique and interesting look. So, I didn't like the real world art but I did like the other world art. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast does a good job, particularly Hanazawa Kana, it feels like she keeps popping up in the stuff I watch, and Sawashiro Miyuki, there's another familiar name. The music, I did not care for. It's difficult to put exactly what I didn't like about it into words. I suppose that it's the very artificial Vocaloid style a bunch of it uses. I'm not saying that Vocaloid music is inherently bad, in fact I rather like some of it, but given the importance that emotions to the story it feels like a really bizarre and inexplicable style for the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 6/10. Kagari clearly has a thing for Yomi and Mato and Yomi's relationship gets really homo-erotic at several points. \\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Black Rock Shooter is a 6/10. It's a decent series with interesting ideas even if they could have been handled better. If the premise sounds interesting to you, give it a try. It's only eight episodes so it is a pretty quick watch.",

Instead of drama-action anime it turned out to be really hard to watch, unlogical, and artifically dramatic piece of junk. Really what was good in it? Pretty other world and opening singed by Hatsune Miku just cannot save something like this from being exactly what I wrote: hard to watch, unlogical and artifically dramatic piece of junk. Characters are acting unrealistically, which is something I really hate since watching School Days. Overall just doesn't make sense. It's just somethingthat tried to be a good drama, but failed monstrually. Also if you read all this and still are going to watch this, I want to warn you: if you have weak nerves, don't do it. Some scenes may be really horroristic for you. Poorly, I'm not able to describe this because of my small english vocabulary, but if you want to know what I mean, try searching for a game \"Alice Madness Returns\". It's similar feeling.\\n\r\nAlso I want to mention why I gave it 9/10 for art. I just liked trick that producers did animating \"real world\" in more tradicional way and specially (I think so) not pretty and animating \"other world\" computer-style, beautifully, full of colors and just pretty. It's just my opinion, this trick will only annoy people that are starting watching anime.\\n\r\nSo this'll be it. Short review of short anime. If you want to check it, just do it. You won't really regret it, it's just a waste of time. I personally wanted to just stop watching it at about episode 5 and finished it just to write this.",

            "content": "I got into the Black\u2605Rock Shooter franchise without any former expectations based on the song by Hatsune Miku (which i enjoy lots, but not particularly the original Miku BRS song) nor the original illustrations, videogame or merchandise. I was embracing a new show, unaware of what was coming, perhaps wondering what sort of quality anything about this brand could possibly have, when this fame was reached through such disperse sorts of media. This perhaps could have made me a little sceptic but i was nontheless very curious, it was all new to me. I was in for a surprise.\r\nSTORY - 9\r\nBorderline 10 rating. One ofthe things that admired me the most about this show was precisely, given that it was limited to 8 episodes and it had enough content to be spread through at the very least 12 episodes, considering the standard pace of most shows these days, it kept dropping in my conscience just how solid and well paced the character development and the situational progress of the events turned out in each episode. How can i explain this, it's as if they managed to keep the show quite fast paced but without feeling rushed at all. It also delivered something that i wasn't very pleased with in the OVA: closure. For those who also already finished watching all 8 episodes AND the OVA, and might disagree with this, i'll put it this way: while the OVA finishes while leaving you hanging with the \"ok, what now??\" question roaming your head, the TV series leave you with a sense that, there will be something beyond this, but you already know what it is and how it will be, you understand the future and the actual story has closure.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nTo justify this high rating, i shall praise this show in 2 different fronts, where it oozed the quality necessary in order to stand out among hundreds of other series. First and foremost, one of the earliest differences between OVA and TV lies in how the characters look like and move in the \"other world\". While the OVA looked great with very interesting coloring, traditional drawing and a rather dynamic however jumpy animation (low cell count?), the TV show won my heart in the most unexpected of ways. In the TV series, the characters in the \"other world\" are rendered in CGI and more often than not, that's a very bad omen for any show, due to the uncanny way 3D character models stand out against everything and everyone else not computer generated. The character CGI in BRS looked to me, both in style as well as in movement dynamics, nearly flawless. Many times it fooled my brain into reconsidering if it wasn't 2D, or perhaps an hybrid, which if it was the case, i shall clap my hands for its seamless way to merge what i would risk saying \"2D meshes on 3D models\". But, go see for yourself, seriously. No, really, do it. Even the movement was extremely fluid and resembled the freedom of traditional animation unlike most 3D models' movements which regularly come paired with clunky/stuck movement. Furthermore, going back into the \"real world\", the characters are 2D and, while they only look good for half of the time we're looking at them (therefore the 9 instead of a 10 rating), i found the detail and expressiveness of these characters to be super effective in conveying their emotions and pulling some reaction from me, of excitement or sadness, etc, everytime there was attention to detail on the characters' facial expressions.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nYes, great. It doesn't have a very memorable soundtrack other than the BRS theme which doesn't count really, because it was already popular out of its own merit (well, to be fair, surely the show will expand on that already estabilished popularity). At various points i couldn't help but become aware of how well the music was being used to enrich several of the core scenes in the story's development, and during certain battles as well (both physical and mental). In terms of sound effects is was equally as competent, delivering some powerful waves especially during some of the battles' most brutal hits.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nI can't say much due to spoilers, but, i will say this: i was impressed how did such a short show even only halfway into it, manage to make me so fond of some of the characters, and really, REALLY, feel glad and sad, and in general, moved with the events that unfolded around them. I consider this quality, a true pearl nowadays, when many shows just can't make you care about even a main character during a supposedly emotion filled peak finale, and then comes something like BRS, that made parts of my body clench in anticipation for the following week's episode, to know what will happen to more characters than just the main protagonist. Each character has a fully explained/revealed past that the viewer learns about in the course of the series and they all have strong motives to drive their intentions, and i believe, the viewer can easily understand all their motives sooner or later, given the smooth way that all the questions are answered (although some questions only get answers on the last 2 episodes or so, making it seem like a confusing story for those who didn't finish it and were expecting the gratification of self explanatory writing contained in isolated episodes that wouldn't dare leave questions hanging with these delicious cliffhangers).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nFully enjoyable, second counting waits between each week, absolute focus on the screen while each and every one of the episodes ran for those 20 minutes, moving characters, interesting story, gripping questions, eyecandy battles. I already know i'll be marathoning the show once it gets a full BluRay release! For a show i had no expectations (good or bad) for, what i found was a rollercoaster of emotions that started off sort of mild on the first episode or two but which escalated intensely with the characters you get to know at a deeper level.",

            "content": "I picked this series up not being a fan of the Black Rock Shooter franchise; just a guy who gave into watching a popular series which was short enough that I could finish in little time.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThere story is based around 2 different settings. 1 being a different world where there honestly isn't much going on in it till like the final  2 episodes. The other is an over the top school based drama that tries way to hard. You could fast forward through the first 6 episodes and not miss much in terms of plot progression. \r\nArt: 8/10\r\nProbably the only reason I carriedon watching this series was for nicely animated fight scenes happening in the other world. Fast paced action scenes that keeps you entertained. I did notice somewhat of a drop in the animation sequences in the middle but they brought it back up to par in the final 2 episodes. Outside of that the animation is pretty fair. No real complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting and songs used through out the series were good for the most part. Nothing to really criticize nor was there anything that really stood out in terms of quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOh boy...why is everyone in this series seem to be an over dramatic lesbian? The interactions between the characters were so over the top sometimes I would just chuckle and shake my head at what I was witnessing. This is one of the few series were I found myself not caring for any members of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI realized half way through  I stopped caring for the shitty characters and lame story line and just looked forward to the next action scene to take place. That was the only thing that kept me going. Thank god this series was only 8 episodes long because I think I would have dropped it if it was the usual 12+\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much else to say here. With only 8 episodes it doesn't take that long to watch through the series to make your own opinion about it. Hopefully to whoever decides to go on that journey enjoys this show a lot more than I did.",

            "content": "Firstly, I want to start off by confessing that I was (and still am) a huge fan of Black Rock Shooter before the OVA and the TV series came out. However I will try my best to write this review as if I know nothing about Black Rock Shooter. All good? Awesome, let's go!\r\nStory 7/10 & Characters 7/10\r\nFor me, the weakest areas of this series are the story and characters. The story centers around Mato as she struggles to understand pain and the feelings of hurt, and Black Rock Shooter in an alternate world trying to save others from their pain and suffering by fightingtheir alternate egos. There is depth to the story (mostly apparent in the last few episodes), but the execution of it leaves much to be desired. The last few episodes in particular was very messy, and I had to rewatch them again to fully understand what was going on. \\n\\n\r\nTo summarize the characters, we have Mato, a bright and cheery girl who has not really experienced much feelings of pain; Yomi, a quiet girl who has difficulty making friends due to certain circumstances; Kasuga, a girl who is obsessed of never letting go of her friend; Yu, another happy girl who is not who she seems; and the school councellor. Most of the characters are rather bland, with the only standout being Kasuga. However the interaction of the characters and their extreme reactions when they feel the world is crashing down around them was one of the standouts of the series. It created a darker feeling to this series compared to the OVA, and while it can be extreme at times, I can imagine some people in real life will act the same way as well if they were thrown into this situation. You won't like many characters from the get-go, but in a way it is refreshing that an anime series isn't going full throttle to make the audience like every single female character, and allows the viewers to be more subjective rather than taking sides.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation of the fighting scenes is a stand out for the most part. Occasionally something doesn't look quite right with the CG work, but it's only the odd scene or two. The non-CG scenes are also amazing, especially the character's expressions. However I did not really like how young Black Rock Shooter looked, and it was hard to tell what was going on during some of the fast paced action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nI felt that the BGM generally fits each scene very well. I also like the occasional lead into the OP or ED. A standout for me would have to be the way the OP and ED was used in the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nPersonally for me, I felt that this was probably THE standout series of the season, where many other series are more light-hearted or less story driven, and I judge how good a series is based on what else was available that series rather than against all other series I have watched in the past. I was planning to drop this series as I wasn't a big fan of the OVA but decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did in the end.",

            "content": "NOTE: This is my first ever written review of an anime (or any other media), so I thought I\u2019d start off with one of my favorite shows. I would happily accept any critic you have for me, but with this all in mind, let\u2019s get started!\r\nDisclaimer: The following review is based on my personal opinions, and does not feature many objective analyses. As such, this may not coincide with yours, or the general publics opinions.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nA single illustration is inspiration to a song and a music video. These in turn lead to an OVA, a manga, and an entire TV series.\r\nThat is the story of theBRS franchise.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: (7 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nI hear a lot of people saying the story in BRS is pretty average, and to be honest, I can\u2019t really argue. In reality, all it\u2019s about is the problems that exist in the friendship between a couple of school girls. The \u201cotherworld\u201d parts, while cool, do not really enhance the story in any way, and in the end, it\u2019s still about a couple of girls and their friendship.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, having said that, I don\u2019t actually think the story is bad. In fact, I found the development of their emotional problems to be quite interesting, and the (few) \u201cplot twists\u201d kept things interesting throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nSome other people I know who watched this felt it was all very confusing, because not much is explained until rather late in the show. While this is true, I find that the somewhat fast pacing of the story will keep you thinking about other stuff, until you can finally get your answers.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nI think the art in BRS is absolutely gorgeous! In fact, this is probably one of the better looking shows I\u2019ve seen. The character designs are great, and the overall art, especially the \u201cotherworld\u201d parts are visually stunning.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes all have very fluent animations, and the aesthetics help set the mood, somewhat. In addition, something I noticed on my second time through, was the attention to detail in the background, in some scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: (8 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nFirst of, let\u2019s talk about the music. Now, I\u2019m not one to usually notice background music, unless it\u2019s very prominent, and thus, I\u2019ll mostly comment on the opening & ending songs here.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song, \u201cBlack Rock Shooter\u201d, written by Supercell\u2019s Ryo, and performed by vocaloid Hatsune Miku, was a great choice, in my opinion. In addition to being a good song, it was the original song that Ryo wrote after being inspired by the original artwork of BRS. Being one of the things that help spawn this wonderful franchise, it only makes sense for it to be used in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the ending song, I also find it very fitting, as well as being a good song.\\n\r\nThe song, \u201cBokura no Ashiato\u201d, is also written by Ryo, and is performed by Supercell\u2019s Koeda.\\n\r\nTo be honest, I just adore Koeda, and can\u2019t possibly dislike anything she sings, but this has also grown to be one of my all time favorite songs.\\n\r\nThe lyrics and overall mood of the song also fits pretty well with the series itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound also receives bonus points, since it features one of my favorite VA\u2019s, Hanazawa Kana. I feel like she fits the role of Mato very well, and while the other VA\u2019s aren\u2019t anything fantastic, they all did a good job in adding to their characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (7 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nPutting character designs (art-wise) aside, I think the characters in BRS are quite... interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like the characters are pretty relatable (even if some character\u2019s actions seem rather stupid), and a character like Kagari really helps to  balance out the cuteness of Mato & Friends.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, I also think they did a great job with Kagari, because to this day she remains one of the most disturbed little girls I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime...\\n\\n\r\nAs for the \u201cotherworld\u201d characters, there isn\u2019t really any dialog or anything to go by, but somehow I still get this feeling of they all being very awesome and in some way \u201cwell developed\u201d characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9 / 10)\\n\\n\r\nI can certainly see why many people may not like this, but personally, I enjoyed this show a lot. I found the mix of \u201ccute girls do things\u201d (at first, at least), and awesome fighting scenes to be very good, and even if the story isn\u2019t anything amazing, it still managed to keep me interested.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m a bit disappointed that it\u2019s so short, though (only 8 episodes), as I feel it could have been longer.",

The series reminds me of Sonic Colors which wouldn't have been a bad thing but it was short and because of that it had a rush story, lacking character development, and it was hard to continue watching it. The only things that were rewarding were the fighting scenes. In short, if you have a thing for the main character silent, female, and a love for battle, I recommend that you beg the creators to make a better series around our silent female shooter.

Well naturally Black Rock Shooter is an enjoyable bizzare anime.\r\nThe Cons\r\n-Its just...Bizarre, if you do not understand the plot you're going to mess up a lot in the story\r\n-Characters are nothing too special. Nothing really leaps towards the audience except maybe Yuu and Mato\r\n-The really weird moments. If you watched this you know what I mean, the staring and etc. Its just....weird\r\nThe Pros\r\n-A BIG improvement over the OVA version. It has the more complex plot, the better message, and was just overall a better story.\r\n-Thebetter variety in characters then the OVA version. Even though more than half of them are generic\\n\r\n-A better see in of the action scenes. The action scenes in the movie, what can I say.\\n\r\n-An overall, different and dangerous approach to Black Rock Shooter. See this anime DARES to be bizarre and crazy which not a lot of animes do. A lot of animes seem to gear towards the mainstream audience. Not to say its bad or anything but it gets tiring after awhile. This TV version it takes risks in building up its plot.\\n\r\n-The Plot, what can I say. Its amazing and probably has one of the best messages an anime has to offer. How you can express pain with friends and in the end you can better yourself from it. Once you solve the plot its an uplifting message, WAY better than the OVA version.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8. It dares to look like something different and for the most part it works. It you could can skip past all the groaners the bullseyes are there. If you like complex stories with great action and decent singing work then this is the anime for you. If you're more of a simpler anime guy watch the OVA.\\n",

            "content": "Black\u2605Rock Shooter was perhaps, at the time, the first full anime I had ever watched, so I had next to nothing to compare it to going in.\r\nTo be honest, I thought it started off really strongly. \r\nThe premise is that there is an alternate dimension where warriors who represent the people in the real world take on the troubles and problems of their counterparts, except in really blown up and intense ways. This leads to many metaphors being portrayed, and overall I really enjoyed the premise on it's own.\r\nHowever ....\r\nI completely see where other people are coming from when they claim that the story waslost potential, and I agree. As much as I adored the idea alone, the story felt rather shallow and truly failed to capitalize on what it had. It didn't take me long to figure out the show's main problem:\\n\\n\r\nIt's far too short for what it's trying to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to be fair, I actually liked the characters quite a lot. They all felt appealing and charming, and I wouldn't mind watching a longer anime surrounding them and their counterparts. But ... none of them really felt fleshed out or particularly interesting, and I think this comes from the shortness of the series. \\n\r\nGiven more time, they could have all developed very interesting and unique personalities and connections, but we really don't get any of that. The worst offender in my opinion was Yomi and Kagari. They seemed like two girls who had gone through a lot together, and possessed a really strange, creepy and interesting relationship. I wanted, more than anything, to learn about their history and why they both ended up in this weird bond, but all I got was a (very) brief flashback to when they were both children. This barely cleared anything up, and I was left just as confused as before. With more episodes, these characters could have been fully ironed out to a great potential. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the series felt extremely -- and I mean EXTREMELY -- rushed and confusing. It all felt like last minute fan fiction to me, and really soured the last couple of episodes. Although the characters were likable but weak, the story wasn't too bad up until the final act. It was immensely confusing and goes back to what I said before: with a longer series, this could have been easily fixed. I didn't really find myself caring about anyone, especially Yu. She was suddenly a centre plot point, despite being probably the most forgettable of the cast and having a 'my-life-used-to-be-terrible' backstory shoehorned in at the last minute to give me the feels. It didn't work, because I was too busy waiting for the next fight sequence to commence. \\n\\n\r\nNow, there are a lot of great things about this show. \\n\r\nThe music and OST, for one, is awesome. Hatsune Miku is always a win, and the soundtrack that plays throughout the fight scenes complements the quick paced, furious action.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which ...\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is amazing, like, some of the best I've ever seen. The mix of CGI and 2D animation blends really well, and makes for unique battle scenes and effects. The action sequences are fantastic, and are animated beautifully and fluently. They keep you on the edge of your seat and sometimes even give you chills at just how badass and spectacular they are. This easily makes the fighting the most enjoyable aspect of the show by far, and I'll happily replay those scenes any day. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime to an extent, and that extent was perhaps up until the final act. It's definitely not a masterpiece (far, far from it), but the intense action and fighting keeps it afloat and memorable. I would recommend it only if you enjoy fast paced action and slow emotional drama bits surrounding mediocre (but cute) girls. Fix the characters, fix the pacing and fix the ending, and this would be one heck of an awesome show.\\n\\n\r\n6.5/10",

            "content": "Having only 4 episodes so far, it's hard to really judge a series yet, but from what I see it's not nearly as bad as many people seem to be saying it is.\r\nTrue, it does seem rather detached from the original OVA (and by that I mean that the plots are unrelated, seemingly. It is the same characters and setting but it would seem that what happened in the OVA did not happen in the world the anime version lives in), BUT taken as the separate entity it is clearly trying to be, I think this anime has a lot of promise.\r\nIt follows the samestyle of first events in \"the real world\" followed with BRS in the other world doing seemingly unrelated things. What I think some people don't realize (in this or the original OVA) that left them so annoyed and confused is that the \"other world\" is a metaphor for what happens to Mato n company in the real world. (small spoiler alert) Their \"counselor\", Saya, even mentions that Mato's \"dreams\" could be \"what couldn't be put into words\". Simply put, BRS's storyline is a dramatic, really aesthetically intense metaphor for the normal events of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThat is why I think many people have such problems with this show and it's original--it takes a lot of thought just to understand it. It's not something that's just plain on the screen, a few explosions and a boss theme and some likable characters and you're done (though it does have those, it has a lot more). \\n\\n\r\nI see this anime as a work of art--not just because the obvious fact htat it's drawn, but the way the story is, is just straight up different. It leaves things open to interpretation, lets (or makes) us as fans use our brains, formulate our own opinions. It's abstract--but still tied into the familiar anime setting to not COMPLETELY throw us under the bus.\\n\\n\r\nThat rant aside, I won't try to claim this is on par with the original. The animation is a bit of a downgrade, the background score is not nearly as well worked in. Frankly, the original is one of my favorite parts of the entire anime genre, and this is not the same level as it was. BUT, just because it is not \"OMFG AMAZING\" doesn't mean it's bad. It's still really good and, as I said, It's early--let's just give this one some time. I personally think it's doing quite well and can (and with luck, will) continue to do well and improve itself.",

            "content": "I didn't have the highest hopes for the Black Rock Shooter anime, but I did expect a somewhat concrete plot, at least. Sadly, we can't all get what we want. Even if it's the bare minimum.\r\nLet's start with the good points then, since they'll be over fairly quickly.\r\nHuke's idea of an alternate world where silent girls fight in order to reduce the emotional stress placed on their teenaged counterparts, all without each other knowing, is something fresh that I believe could have created something so much better than this.The fact that it would be set in high school, with regular problems, and regular girls, wouldmake it all that much more relatable. All in all, it had promise as a good thought provoking anime, to name one of the large range of things it could have been.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was superb. This show was beautiful, and when the art switched between CG and 2D was handled very well. The fight scenes, character designs, etc. were enjoyable. The music as well. The aesthetic part of it all was one of the best considering the leaps that anime have taken recently thanks to digital art.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on.\\n\\n\r\nOh how badly did this disappoint me. To put it bluntly, the characters were ridiculous. In fact, I had a hard time taking all of this seriously. The emotional \"crisis\" that these girls faced made me grimace and shake my head with second-hand embarrassment. Regardless of personal situations, this sort of absurd mental abuse is extremely unrealistic and, frankly, more comedic than tragic.\\n\\n\r\nAt some point, the plot ceased to be linear, got jumbled all over the placed, and I spent more time looking at girls crying and being jealous than seeing them work out their problems with plausible ways. The end was basically thrown in my face as a sort of \"Here, take this for your troubles,\" and then it ended. That was it. A good 8 episodes of what could have been something great, and it ended in a tattered mess of plot holes, things that tried to patch up those plot holes, and girls who were somehow ok even though they clearly weren't an episode or two ago.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, looking at it was nice, thinking about it wasn't.",

Well Black Rock Shooter shows a interesting view of what happens to that pain. After watching the OVA about a year ago I had a interest in BRS. With the Anime's twisting plot, Hardcore fights, and interesting character design I would recommend everyone giving it s try. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nBasically the story revolves around two girls Mato and Yomi who have many burdens and pan in their life's. Over time more characters are introduced and each has their own other world personality that holds their pain.\r\nCharacters: 10/10\r\nBesides thefact of all the main characters having their own other world self sheltering their pain, the people in the real world we full of drama and emotions. Mato is a kind girl who hates fighting and pain while her other self \"Black Rock Shooter\" is a emotionless killer of the other girl's other self's. The rest of the cast also has their own personality's and traits that makes them unique.\\n\\n\r\nSetting: 8/10\\n\r\nI personally have mixed feeling about the setting as it contains two different worlds. One is the real world where the cast deals with their problems in a high school type setting while the second world is full of different places that change depending on what is going on with their real life's self. It just depend on what is happening that makes the setting good.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\r\nHaving the opening the official song titled \"Black Rock Shooter\" sung by Hatsune Miku really helped add the feeling into the anime. The ending song titled \"Bokura no Ashiato\" or \"Our Footsteps\" really added a great feeling to the anime as well with it's happy tune. The music during the anime as also very good as it fit the theme of what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Statement:\\n\r\nBeing a only Eight episode long anime, I encourage people to give it a try. It is full of emotions and drama with a dark interesting plot and setting. But if you willing to give it a try I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nReview by ~Flora",

            "content": "This is a spoiler free review:\r\nThis is one of the most visually appealing anime I have ever seen. It is a very artistic show that rivals the Monogatari series. Brilliant pastel colors and varying shades of scenery are portrayed throughout and the entire show is rich with symbolism. The different \"worlds\" have their own color and personality and set the stage well for the theme of this show. You'll also not find a more awesome-looking set of characters than the 5 main alter egos.\r\nThe theme of this show is a young middle school girl and multiple others who attend school, live out the drama intheir lives, and heal from said drama. Meanwhile in a dreamworld of sorts, their alter egos do battle in a symbolic reflection of the drama in the real world. The show is focused on pain and suffering, pure brutal battle, dreams, symbolism and art, and endurance.\\n\\n\r\nThe cosplay possibilities are remarkable and I've seen pictures of many excellent reproductions. The outfits and weaponry are quite excellent and the violence is top notch. The girls of the series are very attractive and are among some of my favorite characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like artistic animes with teenage drama and grinding, bashing, slamming, shooting battle as well as mystery and symbolism, this is the show for you. The show has minimal romance and is not a romance anime by any means but definitely one of friendship. This show also has a pretty excellent and addictive opening song that is somewhat reminiscent of the vocaloid-style singing.\\n\\n\r\nCategories: Art, symbolism, mystery, mech, action, battle, pain and suffering, friendship.",

            "content": "There are many people in this world that can either fight pain, ignore it or get eaten whole by it. Those that can fight against it, have a different \"me\" in a different world. If that different \"me\" dies, all the pain is taken away, and the other \"me\" is deceased. \r\n....\r\nWell I just gave you a summary of the plot in a nutshell.\r\nBlack\u2605Rock Shooter is an anime about a young girl; Kuroi Mato who lives a nice and peaceful life until she gets to Highschool and meets girl called Takanashi Yomi. Yomi is a quiet girl who has a lot of worries on herhead, trying to stay away from as many people as possible while Mato is a energetic and a bit weird person who wishes to see all the colours of this world. As Mato tries to become friends with Yomi, things start to get messy, to the point where everything falls down. \\n\\n\r\nNow, Black\u2605Rock Shooter is a short anime so going into too much details would only spoil a LOT of it. This is why this review might get short, but without anymore rambling, let's start:\\n\\n\r\nSo here is a short description of Story:\\n\r\nStory is a complicated one, especially at the beginning, but once you get to episode 8, everything will click into place and you will get it, if not then I would recommend either hitting me a message or reading it up. \\n\r\nThe main plot is all about pain and how different people react differently to it. \\n\r\nThat is sadly all I can say about the story without getting too deep into spoiler territory. \\n\\n\r\nVisuals/sound track: \\n\r\nArt was....mediocre. The eye art style was amazing, animation was also good but the main thing that took the points away from it all, was the CGI animation. Now, I am a huge CGI nazi when it comes to anime (expect the very good ones) and I am a huge fan of hand drawn shows/movies. The CGI wasn't that much of the deal but my eyes couldn't focus as it was all in my face when it came to battles. I cannot give the score lower than 5 however, since it was still amazing CGI animation. If it would be terrible/badly made, I would've been forced to give it rank lower than 5. The ost of this anime was good, way more better than I was expecting to be honest. But the opening was sang by Hatsune Miku, Japanese computer singer known as \"Vocaloid\" and because of it, opening song didn't sound great. Her voice doesn't always fits and the fact that she sounds so robotic made it not very comfortable for my ears. If it would've been sang by a real person, I could've excused it. But this isn't a case in here and sadly it won't be. The Ost on it's own is great to listen to if you want to have some kick ass action or something a bit more peaceful. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nThe characters here were....how should I put it? Filled with emotions. Although their designs are simple, I still loved how they were filled with hatred, selfishness, sadness and depression as well as joy, excitement and curiosity. This anime made me  hate a character with a passion and this is something not many animes can do easily. The other \"me\" on the other hand were filled with aggression. I would love to talk more about the other \"me\" but that would be too much of a spoiler. Ok, as I said in my last review for \"Kyoukai no Kanata\"; \" if you have characters, good or bad, with wonky character interaction I will be forced to point it out.\" And sadly, this is the area where I have to do so. The characters, although have strong emotions, don't really have great character interactions. The talks they have are unreal (in all anime if I should be honest) and the way the all act once everything starts to crumble is just insane. I would talk more about this; but as always, that would be slowly getting into spoiler territory. If you wish to see it for yourself, watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\\n\r\nBlack\u2605Rock Shooter is a colourful yet dull anime. It takes you onto journey of emotions and their colours. It is describing everything in complicated way and it may be a bit confusing at times. However, once you will reach to the end, all the emotions that turned into black will open into a light blue sky and will give you a little food for thoughts. If you aren't really smart or you get things very slowly, I would suggest for you to skip this anime. But if you are easy with puzzles like this, go ahead and watch it. \\n\\n\r\nI am so sorry that this review was so short, but so was the anime, so I cannot say anything more than this.\\n\\n\r\nThis is IKira-n\\n\r\nSigning out.",

The story was the biggest let down. How come those two girls they are connected? That's the biggest itching point for me.\r\nArt 7/10\r\nThe only thing I found good. Clear cut images.

            "content": "To tell you frankly, I\u2019m having mixed feelings about this one. Black Rock Shooter (which will now be known as BRS), being a short anime with only 8 episodes is not that easy to rate. On one hand, I really want to give it a high score but on the other hand, I see a lot of flaws in the story itself. Well, we won\u2019t get anywhere by talking like this so let\u2019s just get on to the review.\r\nStory: Actually, I think that BRS had one of the greatest potentials in any anime I have seen up to date. That\u2019s why I find it sadthat the story didn\u2019t develop properly because the series was too short. To provide you with a quick overview of the story, it starts off with a girl named Kuroi Mato, who has been having dreams about some girls who are constantly fighting in an alternate world. It turns these girls are actually their \u201csouls\u201d, the ones who carry the burden of all their sorrow. I won\u2019t mention anything else from the plot but let me tell you, it could\u2019ve been one of the most epic storyline out there if only it had been executed properly. You see, the problem with the plot is that it was way too short while being too fast paced. The story didn\u2019t have time to develop. It was all happening too fast that the one watching would either not be able to enjoy it or would be left utterly confused because pace of the story. It also suffers from poor explanations. In the entire anime, there were very little explanations, leaving the viewers bewildered as to what is happening since no explanations were given. For example, although the latter half of the story is spent on the alternate world, we, the viewers have no idea as to what it is exactly. They also never explained as to why only girls have \u201csoul\u201d counterparts. Heck, they didn\u2019t even mention as to why they even fight in the first place. To put it simply, it seems that the author took these things for granted, leaving us with an anime with a good plot, but done with poor execution. I will only give this a 7/10 for the reasons stated above.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: If there is one thing that made this anime truly awesome, it would be the animation. Although the real world looks normal, like your everyday generic anime, it is during the fight scenes that BRS truly shines. The animation was superb, with slick movements, great art and those weird yet epic angles. The special effects were also beautifully rendered, with blood being replaced by spurts of light of each character\u2019s respective color motif. There are also those scenes where they have sword clashes, with sparks flying everywhere, scenes wherein they fight using guns, with shells raining down like no tomorrow and of course, some good hand to hand combat. Lastly, the background was also beautifully drawn, with each fight happening in a differently themed area, adding to the awesomeness of these scenes. These scenes were the one of the few redeeming qualities of BRS, and I\u2019ll have to say, they really did a great job on this part. Now, with regard to the songs, they were pretty good, but they weren\u2019t really my type of music (the OP was actually sung by Hatsune Miku). The background music though is something that I like a lot. It provides the ambience needed for each scene, and it\u2019s one of the things I liked. I also found the voice acting good. The voices syncs properly with the characters mouths and it wasn\u2019t overdone(A.K.A overacting).Overall, I give art a 9/10, because the anime only shines during the fights, and is pretty bland during the normal scenes while I give sound a 8/10, because I didn\u2019t like the opening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Now, if only this part was done right, it could\u2019ve saved the entire anime, but unfortunately they didn\u2019t. The characters had good concepts, but character development was going way too fast that it looked stupid, or at least unnatural. The main character, Kuroi is just a normal girl, who goes to school and basically enjoys life then suddenly she starts spouting nonsense philosophical lines about pain and stuff. Then there\u2019s also Black Rock Shooter herself, who is pretty much an emotionless mute. Then there\u2019s Kagari, a girl who is a bit sick in the head suddenly turns into a cutesy tsundere girl. And there\u2019s Yomi, a girl who gets way too attached to people. There are other characters out there, but it would take too long to mention them all but the bottom line is, the characters are developing way too fast that they start to become boring. Overall, I would give it a 6/10 because the character development is poor, although this can also be blamed on the pacing of the story itself, which is way too fast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Did I enjoy it? Not really. I can\u2019t say that it bored me but I also can\u2019t say that I enjoyed it thoroughly. The Fight scenes were awesome and I enjoyed them, but the story itself was boring, and so are the characters, so they pretty much cancel out each other. All I can give it is a 7/10 since it wasn\u2019t a \u201cmeh\u201d anime nor is it an \u201cUber Awesome!\u201d anime but more of an \u201cOK\u201d anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: As I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m having mixed feelings about this anime. But since I\u2019m more of a fan of story-driven animes, I\u2019d be a bit biased and give this anime a 7/10.Now, if you\u2019re the kind of person who likes action and stuff like that, I will suggest that you watch this cuz\u2019 you will probably like this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have any comments about my review, or have a different opinion about this anime, please do write a comment on my page, so I can see about what you think.\\n",

It is very balad like, very fitting for an ending.\\n\r\nNothing really stands out on the BGMs and sound effects department.

            "content": "Black Rock Shooter, the entire franchise, is very appealing and at the same time frustrating. The entire thing is very aesthetically pleasing, and the base concept is great, but the execution is worse than Dragon Ball Evolution.\r\nAfter watching the original OVA I was left craving for more, wondering what the hell it was that I just watched. In my opinion, however, it is the \"real\" world side of things that causes the franchise to crash and burn. The \"Forced Drama\", if you will, makes no sense and has me wondering why the writers didn't just come up with some legitimate problems and issues for theircharacters to experience. The tension and suspense is there, but it's very watered down by the fact that the viewer has yet to have seen anything that would bring on such mental stress and fatigue. \\n\\n\r\nMy guess is that the writers wished to emphasize how much \"pain\" one feels from everyday exchanges and relationships. Perhaps they are trying to remind a society that has become numb through self-induced ignorance of how much their actions and voices effect one another. The BRS world gives us a visual interpretation of this, and looks badass doing it. \\n\\n\r\nSome may say that the fight scenes had no \"tension\" in them due to the characters seeming to have the constitution of Chuck Norris. In my opinion this makes it even more tense, and amps up the action. In anime where a character can't take massive damage, they always dodge or block in the last second, escaping death by a hair, over and over again. However, in BRS' case, you never see anything coming. I can't remember how many times I went \"pfff, she'll just dodge it. no biggie\" just have myself go \"Ohhhhhh, damn that had to hurt!\". Not knowing when one of the characters is going to reach their breaking point makes the fights that much more gut wrenching. Not to mention the fact that they are insanely brutal. \\n\\n\r\nBut, in the end, the characters that represent the \"real\" side of things bring everything down. If only they were a bit more unique, and didn't always swing this way and that emotionally for no apparent reason, then the story itself wouldn't have suffered so much Yes, if we could get a revamp for the characters, I could give this anime the 8 or 9 it deserves.",

But there are few times that I've been so impressed and utterly moved by a show as to be motivated to write an impassioned piece to compel others to behold its glory. From the very first episode it's obvious that you've got pure gold on your hands. All the characters are multidimensional and have a lot of intricate back stories to reveal. This is especially true with the main character, Mato. She graces the viewer withcountless interesting, multi-layered observations on the the world we live in. All of this is done in an incredibly down-to-earth way that makes it incredibly relatable. I mean we've all been in middle school and a lot of tough shit happened to us like bullying and being left out of the cool kids' cliques and being left to watch animes and read mangas. But the way her relationship with her friend Yomi develops in such a believable way that you can't help but get sucked into the show's intricate story of friendship and understanding. I really recommend that everyone give this show a shot because I can almost guarantee it will change the way you watch animes. It's really that brilliant.",

            "content": "Right.  This show.  Touted as one of the biggest train wrecks in the medium.  And well, I won't deny that it is.  Initially the concept seems interesting if you're into the head bleedingly obvious symbolism and metaphorical themes that anime can't seem to ever play off subtly, but near the end, around episode 6, it just gets absolutely crazy.\r\nSo with that, I'll give a sort of summary of my thoughts with no spoilers, because I feel like my thoughts conflict very much with both the people who like and dislike this show.\r\nTL;DR\r\nIn my opinion, this show is basically Madoka Magicka withoutthe crushingly obvious plot hole inherent to that show.  It jumps off the deep end in a very similar way, has very similar themes, and overall is just as obvious with it's themes and symbolism.  Where this show is ahead of Madoka Magicka to me,is in that it embraces how absolutely ridiculous it really is.  I found myself laughing at the \"serious\" bits in this show just as often as I did with Madoka Magicka, but unlike that show, it did manage to grip me multiple times, especially near the end of the show.  Yes, it's melodramatic, but it never tries to be anything that isn't melodramatic, and at times it's melodrama can be genuinely intriguing and scary.  While it might not connect with you on an emotional level like it wants to, it's a good show for people who aren't smart, but want to feel like they are.  It's also got some great action and character designs in the actions scenes themselves.\\n\\n\r\nActual Review now (slight spoilers):\\n\\n\r\nFor most of the show, there isn't much to really talk about.  It's a fairly interesting story of a girl, Mato, trying to make friends and live a normal life, intercut with battles of people who seem to represent the main cast fighting with various metaphorical weapons and settings, as well as a separate story in these action scenes that up until the end has very little dialogue, which is nice since any dialogue there would be redundant and grating.\\n\\n\r\nNow, like I said in the TL;DR, this show does in fact drop off the deep end in terms of plot in the later half.  It doesn't necessarily have a plot twist per se,  but more of a plot explosion.  It gets taken from a highly melodramatic school slice of life show with metaphorical action scenes intercut to a ridiculous multiple dimension style show where the fate of the world with the metaphorical world and emotions of every girl on the planet at stake in the space of like 3 minutes, if you start counting from when this plot point gets brought up.  While I'm not a huge fan of the direction that it took, I can respect where it ended up, instead of completely dropping the ball.  It also managed to do something that not many shows of this kind actually pull off when they have these sorts of plot explosions.\\n\\n\r\nIt actually provides closure.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the over-the-top melodrama this show loves to soak in, I can get behind it.  One, because I can laugh at it.  Now, many people think that laughing at melodrama intrinsically means that you don't like it, but to me, when I laugh at the over-the-top shupa sherioush scenes in a show, it's because I get it.  I get that it is a logical extreme.  And in this show it does work, because when you are in middle school, you are crazy.  And the characters that create the melodrama have a right to do so, except maybe for Kagari and Saya.  The other characters that create the drama have extreme emotional problems that were drawn from some truly Elfen Lied level trauma, to the point where some of it is actually funny how bad their lives are.  Kagari, though, broke her legs and had to live much of her life in a wheelchair, but can suddenly walk once some sense it brought to her, and she has become a very anti-social toxic person because of this.  Saya, on the other hand, is a normal person, through and through.  I myself have gone through what Saya has gone through, and she has virtually no reason for her sudden heel turn half way through the show into super creepy territory.  Overall, though, I find all the melodrama not so out of place, just because of the nature of the situation.  These are psychologically scarred people all trying to get through one of the most confusing parts of their lives, where they think that everything already matters more then it really does, no matter their psychological condition.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way the setting and the characters age saves the story for me.\\n\\n\r\nSo the action.  Now, I'd like to say that CG is just the worst thing ever.  And that's coming from me, the guy who loves Arpeggio of Blue Steel, the dumbest CG harem action show of all time.  The problem with CG is that it all too often looks too artificial.  And I know, anime is animation.  It's artificial by nature.  But I can still tell that Humans drew the characters and the back grounds and the characters within them.  With CG, it feels like the human element is taken out of the equation entirely.  That being said, they pulled off some of the best CG I've seen in this show.  It was to the extent that for the first 5 minutes or so, while the intro scene was in CG, I couldn't tell.  I'm not a huge fan of the idea of CG being used in just the action scenes, though.  It seems like a very unnecessary stylistic choice.  That being said, it's fine.  I actually kind of like how the CG in the action scenes takes you out of the show, so that the very visceral violence on screen doesn't clash tonally with the overall light-hearted real-world scenes.  Instead it serves as more of a departure from it, and just a spectacle to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I do like this show, I never cared about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nNow, that's not saying much, considering it takes a lot for me to care about a character, and anime tends to be focused on getting it's massive plotlines and other aspects more then it does having you actually care about characters.  What I'm trying to say with this paragraph is that the show works despite the fact that I couldn't necessarily connect with it's characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, yes, it is a giant mess of a show.  But I love it for that.  I love that it tried to pull some crazy nonsense, and did despite the consequences.  It is a train wreck of a show, I will not deny that.  I will, though, say that it can be admired for what it did do, as this isn't a story you will find anywhere else or executed as well.",

People who see the series as that, will most likely give it alow score.\\n\r\nHowever under the surface, there are deep underlying themes along with quite a bit of symbolism.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThis might be a bit biased, because i really like psychological shows. But the concept of two worlds being intertwined while still being separate is a really cool concept to me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art in the slice of life aspect, isn't phenomenal but still decent.\\n\r\nThe vivid animation in the fighting scenes however, is fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 The opening of black rock shooter, is a song written partially by supercell, and sung by the vocaloid hatsune miku. Along with quite a few nice parts of the soundtrack, the overall sound in the anime is pretty damn good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters is what makes this show fantastic. How the characters change according to their counterparts, along with a nice plot twist (that i won't spoil) makes sure that you're really invested in the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThe overall premise makes you think, which i personally really like, and once in a while, you get to sit back and enjoy beautifully animated fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSome people either don't understand the story or just don't like the story. This is natural, but it's also the reason Black rock shooter has such a low rating.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Black rock shooter is definately not for everyone, however if you like profound stories and psychological shows, i highly recommend it.",

What the darn.\r\nI watched this thing when i was maybe like 12 or something and im probably in no position to provide a critical analysis but the show's tendency to be the most retarded thing ever and yet still enjoyable has stuck with me to this day. It's probably good that I am making this my first review because this show is something that i remember so fondly. \r\nAnd probably not for the right reasons. Remembering this show is like trying to eat a Campbell's\u00ae Chunky\u2122 Soup with a fork. You're gonna get somechunks of good meat but your also not gonna get a lot of what makes the flavors come together.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does that mean? Fuck if I know. But you can probably figure it out. \\n\\n\r\nThis may seem like a rant but i promise that this is getting somewhere. \\n\\n\r\nFirst of all the story made no sense. All i can tell you is that there was girls fighting in another dimension, while a reality version of themselves deal with emotional issues and the girls fighting in the other dimension are linked with what what was happening in the real world. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the emotional issues seemed pointless and stupid and not realistic at all. I'll refrain from going in depth on any of the \"drama\", both because I don't want to spoil and also because i cant even remember a single one because they were so lackluster. \\n\\n\r\nThough it seems like I'm just shitting on this show... that doesnt mean i hated it. The character designs were freaking rad and the animation was fun to watch. And though the Real life drama that the girls are going through seemed mostly pointless, it was interesting to see it personified with robot girls fighting. \\n\\n\r\nSo i would honestly highly recommend this show. I feel like this is probably the worst show I've ever seen but it was a bizarre adventure going through this show's awful flaws and see them pathetically attempt to wrap themselves up. \\n\\n\r\nIt is an incredible experience to see something so bad be so good.",

            "content": "Black Rock shooter has in it all that an anime needs to take even the most veteran viewers on an amazing ride, but you must be ready to watch it. In the following lines, I'll do my best to explain why.\r\n  The story follows Mato Kuroi, a shy middleschooler whose very design relies on a fantastically exaggerated sense of empathy. She starts with little meaning to life or problems of her own, but we follow her as she dives into the lives of those around her and takes their issues and angst as her own, almost as if she's reading a reallygood novel and getting invested in it. It's as if her sole purpose in life is to jump into these stories and solve all the issues of the small, but memorable cast in a way we as audience wish we could.\\n\r\n  And that's just half the story. The other half is nothing but concentrated, heavily symbolic, marvelously animated CGI fights done by the mysterious armed girls that resemble the show's characters in a different universe. This artistically beautiful and enticing world is deeply connected to the real one, and paying close attention to detail is paramount if you wish to understand what's happening in each episode and in the story as a whole.\\n\r\n  Overall, BRS's true objective is to bring reflection on emotions and all the different ways we deal with them, using a wide variety of storytelling techniques to shove loads of story into a tiny 8 episode frame. This is also its largest flaw: being such a dense anime, you will get confused if you try to watch it halfheartedly or expecting some dumb tale about a girl in a bikini shooting stuff.\\n\r\n  Not that I blame you for thinking that; the cover does kinda look like that's what they were going for.\\n\r\n  I believe that the main reason for the abysmal difference between my rating and the general score is due to too many people not investing enough time and attention in understanding the story. I can't blame them, since I've only realized everything I wrote here years later, as I watched it a second time.\\n\r\n  Also the opening is Vocaloid, so be warned.",

            "content": "This is my first review, so please be gentle\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed BRS for both its art and its overall enjoyment. BRS is one of my favorite Shoujo Ai (as almost all shoujo ai's are for me), but this one captured that cute moe essence of admiration for one-another, in the \"real\" world. where as the \"other\" world versions could could to some extent see the struggles that the characters were enduring.\r\n8 Story: \r\nThe story was at times a little hard to follow, and could easily be watched in conjunction with one another (i found it to be more like one long movie then a series).managing to capture my attention for almost the entire series.\\n\\n\r\n9 Art: this anime has a duel-art feature that occurs when switching between the two worlds, in the real world it is a standard school life animation style with well presented lighting and imaging. Where as in the \"other\" world we have a much larger spectrum of art styles ranging from camera angel changes to a much broader spectrum of coloring and flashy graphics.\\n\\n\r\n7 Sound: \\n\r\nA very nice sounding anime nothing to particular to comment on.\\n\\n\r\n8 Character:\\n\r\nI do so enjoy my shoujo ai couplings (and i refuse to deny them in this anime). The characters just had a very good feel to them from teenage girls trying to deal with life and struggling though it all. i do believe people can go though hard emotions even on small issues, in so people are insecure and do require motivation from those around them, which i believe this anime brought out nicely with in  its character base.\\n\\n\r\n8 Enjoyment:\\n\r\nLike i stated earlier i was able to watch this like one long movie rather then episode by episode (for some one with ADD that's grand). the show was more then worthy of my time.\\n\\n\r\n9 Overall:\\n\r\nfor those that can appreciate a nice shoujo ai, coupled with good are and sweet character base, plus a rather deep story line along with a show that doesn't fully explain every detail to it i am saying right now its worth a watch + it is rather short\\n\\n\r\nplease flame me if you disagree with my review i am always open for debate",

            "content": "I got curious about this anime after seeing an AMV for it. \r\nThere are two world in this anime: the parallel world of the female fighter Black Rock Shooter and these other female fighters and then there is the real world of six female characters around whom the plot revolves. At first, you may be totally confused because the anime switches back and forth between these two worlds without explaining why. It is only in the later episodes that the connection between the two worlds is explained. If you watch the anime closely, you can figure it out beforehand  I like did. \r\nPersonally, Ifound the reason for the connection between the two worlds very interesting, but I wish there could have been an explanation for how the parallel world came to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe female fighters of the parallel world are very strong physically and have awesome weapons and abilities to fight with. They are exciting to watch because one or two of them fight with Black Rock Shooter every episode. \\n\r\nAs for the girls in the real world, they are complicated. With the exception of Kagari, these female characters are good people who have painful personal issues that are revealed as the show progresses and gets dark.  Depending on the character, you can either empathize with them or pity them. \\n\\n\r\nThe two worlds and the characters in each of them come together to form a story about learning how to deal with life in all its painful and non painful moments. There is a metaphor for the anime's moral that compares life's ups and downs to bright colors and dull colors as well as a bird flying through different places. By the end of the anime, I found these metaphors very poignant.\\n\\n\r\nA final notable aspect of this anime is the animation style. It reminded me  a lot of Madoka Magica because it makes the parallel world look like a garish funhouse. However, it wasn't a bad thing because it fit the characters in the parallel world as well as the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the anime, despite its plot hole with the parallel world. If you like watching anime that deals with psychological or emotional problems in a creative way, then I would recommend this. If you are just expecting an action-packed anime, then steer clear of this. \\n\\n",

Perhaps it was too confusing, or the watcher didn't receive real pain to understand what on earth was going on with this anime (I'm not saying you didn't for those who did).\r\nBlack Rock Shooter has two different worlds. One world is the normal life-style you're living in, and the other world is where your 'other-self' exists in and fight non-stop. You don't do anything else there. Just fight. You see, this anime has been a serious confusion for me from timeto time, and at times I felt like just ditching it because it's too depressing. But, I continued it. After all, it's only 8 episodes, and I thought nothing will hurt to just finish it all on one day, and man I'm super glad I didn't stop. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime comes from an MV, and its main topic is about pain, pain and nothing else but pain. Well, aside from love and friendship that is. I can only warn you that this anime is freakin' depressing, and I've been in a bad mood the whole day bc of it, but I'm still grateful I finished it since I definitely saw a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nYou won't clearly understand it if you're the type that doesn't notice the 'behind messages', and simply watch for mere entertainment. This anime surprisingly showed us our real harsh reality, and chose a VERY interesting way to interpret that thought into our heads. In the other world, there is another you fighting and enduring your pain. When your chest hurts, someone endures more than your pain, because they worry about you. They feel more stronger, and they want to do anything for you even thought they think it's helpless. This is a message that got through me from the first episode of this anime, and I've kept positive about it and only doubted it a few times bc of its strangeness of the 'other world.'\\n\\n\r\nIf I talk anymore, I'm afraid I'll spoiler you meanings that you have to find yourself; this anime is a hidden gem in MAL, and it's definitely a must-watch. Focus on this anime, but I don't advice you to watch it if your mood gets changed a little bit too fast. \\n\r\nI know I rated it '7', and no it's not because it only contains 8 episodes. In fact, I personally agree that 8 episodes is enough and anymore will have the series dragging and dragging non-stop. I didn't give it a 10 bc sometimes the characters were too much to handle and the mood swings didn't quite work out for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was still a good-worthy series to watch.",

            "content": "Story: 7/10\r\n  Interesting idea, I think this took a little bit of plot from Evangelion with the whole 'dream stuff', but near the end it definitely differentiates itself with that. Being that the story is driven off the characters emotions, its is not exactly the most logical based story, this brings me  to the 2nd point.\r\nCharacters: 7/10\r\n   Now the characters are really what drives the show, the main plot is driven by the way the different girls interact with each other and themselves. Although there is a plot reason for the characters being the way they are, it still appears thatmany times the characters just don't act in a way enjoyable to watch. The interactions between one of the characters and her lover, then the actions after that, it made it feel really shallow and stupid of a plot point, but again, the plot explains why this interaction occurs.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\n  The art style, while in the 'real world' is really nothing to be noted or to be praised, although good, the 'dream world' is where the art really shines. The fights were quite pretty and having the silent characters allowed the combat to seem really mesmerizing and interesting. The depictions of the girls in their dream self was also one of the top points (though it typically fell down to the formula of: more hair - skimpier outfits - big weapons).  The symbolic message much of the art provides in the dream worlds, while it can be hard to see at first (bear in mind I've only watched this once), is quite interesting and unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\n   Not bad, soundtrack had some nice songs. Past that not much worth noting \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\n  As I stated before, the annoying nature of some of the characters brought the enjoyment down to an 8, but >\\n\r\n>\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\n   >I'd still recommend this show. There are its flaws, and one of the big reasons the overall is not at a 9 for me is because of the characters. The art and combat scenes really made the truthfully mundane nature of the show really interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy the show.",

            "content": "The magical girl genre is one of anime's longest-lasting, and two of the most popular magical girl series just aired this decade: 2011's genre-busting Puella Magi Madoka Magica, and 2013's over-the-top spectacle Kill la Kill. But between these two modern phenomena came something that was a mix of both: 2012's Black Rock Shooter. The final major installment of the once huge franchise attempted to mix Madoka's heart-wrenching story of two girls struggling to maintain their friendship with the high-octane action of Kill la Kill, but it ultimately failed to blend both.\r\nBlack Rock Shooter's story revolves around two plot lines. The first revolves around Mato Kuroiand Yomi Takanashi, two high school girls who form a bond that's constantly being jeopardized by the interference of their classmates, and the second revolves around the eponymous Black Rock Shooter, a stoic and pale girl fighting to the death in another world. Unfortunately, the hot-blooded shonen-esque mood you'd expect to find in the latter plot makes its way into the former as an over-the-top, almost laughable melodrama. Nearly every character from the first story is unlikeable, from the yandere who pretended to be crippled for years to keep Yomi to herself, even causing Yomi's equally-as-absurd mental breakdown, to the school nurse to talks students down in order to send them into a depression. \\n\\n\r\nThe second plot, on the other hand, on the other hand, is by far the best part of the entire series. Directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi, these CG-animated battles are some of the most well-animated and admittedly underrated fight scenes in the medium, having top-tier choreography and being visually appealing; you could tell that Imaishi took cues from Black Rock Shooter when he was making Kill la Kill, which, amusingly, also stars a scantily-clad girl wielding a massive weapon. Also appealing is the general aesthetic of the \"other world\" in which these fights take place; the gothic/checkerboard setting and the half-punk, half-mechanical character designs make for a unique visual experience that make the already phenomenal animation all the more memorable. Unfortunately, their hype factor is undermined by the lack of emotion that these fighters express, making it hard to get invested in them. Additionally, this subplot only makes up 40 minutes of this 8-episode series, most of which takes place in the second half, which isn't is worth slogging through the first half.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note is the lack of a memorable music track. The whole series was built on one the most iconic Niconico music videos of all time, and nearly every subsequent installment had a kickass soundtrack, including the OVA's Battle of BRS and the game's NO SCARED. The anime, however, has no such iconic track, with the whole OST being rather forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, not only does Black Rock Shooter fail to stand up to its modern-day contemporaries, but it also fails at delivering the standard magical girl theme of friendship. Being the last work in the Black Rock Shooter franchise, I think it's safe to say that the Black Rock Shooter anime ended up burning out its own star.",

There was a lot more depth to the characters than what a first thought going into this anime. The art is just amazing! The CGI and regular 2D animation style using together was brilliant.

The ones that like it only for the fighting scenes are idiots/BAKA.

            "content": "Before seeing the anime and seeing figurines, posters etc I thought  BRS would be a blast. It was amazing how vibrant the colours were and how they would captivate you. After watching it though, it was pretty terrible. The major problem with the story is the target audience and the age of the characters. Who is it actually targetting? It seems like something that targets twelvies however tries to convey a deep and important message. Along with the ten year old looking characters I was really confused as the messages that are conveyed do not seem easily understood to younger children. I feel asthough if the characters were older it would dramatically increase the joy I had for this anime.\\n\r\nThe art on the other hand was amazing in fight scenes however the weirdly coloured blood seemed to dim down the awesomeness. \\n\r\nIn terms of art and graphics this anime is near the top even though it was made in 2012 and art has changed. Other aspects all contributed to a poor anime with a weak storyline and a lack of characterisation.",

            "content": "Well, this was on fucking badass anime. Oh yeah, this is my second review on MAL. My first one sucked. A lot. Okay, time to start his review!\r\nFirst up, THE STORY! That was probably the worst part of this anime. I had no idea what was going on at the start of the anime. So first this awesome fight scene with 3D and a lot of CG pops up for a minute or two. Then it switches to a regular school scene. It repeats this cycle over and over in the anime. I had no idea what was going on here. Of course, later onI grasped the meaning of this situation. But the PLOT HOLES, goddammit. They need to patch those up. Maybe take a bucket of explaining and a few pieces to fix them. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound wasn't bad at all. The traditional Black Rock Shooter song with Hatsune Miku and supercell in there. Definitely matches. I'm not a big fan of Miku(sorry guys, but GO LILY!!!), but this song matched and I sorta liked it.\\n\\n\r\nHere comes the character train. The characters in the \"other world\" as they call it were pretty epic in terms of looks and personality. They didn't talk much though. Only Black Rock Shooter really talked at the end. The characters in the \"real world\" were average, nothing special. Average anime school girls, whatever you call them. I'd give it an 8 for this at most.\\n\\n\r\nWell, did i damn enjoy this anime. The fighting sequences were top-tier. Never seen an action anime like BRS. I mean, I could be a Sports Anchor and be like, \"There goes Black Rock Shooter giving a skeleton her flying kick! She draws out her swords and slices and blasts the surrounding soldiers with some smooth moves!\" You get what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime called \"Black Rock Shooter\" was some top-tier action for me. On my list of action, this would probably place #1. Oh yeah, I even have a BRS pencil case :D. Jelly? So, to wrap up this quick review that I finished in less than 20 minutes, I'll give BRS an overall of 9. Pretty nice of me, huh? See you next time at...somewhere here on this site. Be sure to check out my anime list!",

There are its pros and cons , First the pros , catchy soundtrack , opening and ending songs never fails to make one rewind to hear the song again . Another pro is that the art was really good , it was so well made , it makes you want to watch more of those intense fighting scenes . Okay , now the cons . The cons are boring  and confusing plot , poor character development . The anime was bad as the plot wasreally confusing , it had a lot of unexplained situations which leaves you to be confused after almost every episode , making the anime a painful experience to watch through despite it being only a short anime series . Also , at times , it justs focuses on plain boring things for example ( The macaron thing ) This really brings the anime down as it makes the anime less enjoyable . It also doesn't focus on character development , making you really confused when a new character pops out or a new ability pops out . The plot was also confusing as it left things unexplained and even if they did , they probably done a bad job at it . ( The beginning part especially where BRS just pops out and starts fighting with her opponents )   As for the anime being a hit or miss , it's a miss due to it's confusing plot and underdeveloped characters",

The problem I found with Black Rock Shooter was the fact that the story was as dull as an overused knife and really wasn\u2019t as good as it was trying to be. The problem here is the fact that there are eight episodes with which to build characters that I care about, but I never do care about them. So from the start it\u2019s a tear-fest where I feel that I should relate to the characters, but can\u2019t because I don\u2019t know them. And Ifelt that way throughout the entire series. On top of that, the supposedly \u201cadult\u201d metaphors weren\u2019t that adult. There were two main metaphors, the bird that takes on all the colors, and the world of Black Rock Shooter itself. Both were rather basic metaphors for emotions, and neither were at all adult. You didn\u2019t have to truly think about what the chains around Dead Master meant, or the heart they connected to. It\u2019s pretty simple.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, I\u2019m just going to say it bluntly, sucks. Mato wants to be friends with Yomi but can\u2019t  because Yomi\u2019s best friend, Kagari, has her in chains essentially. Everything Kagari wants, she gets, because Yomi feels bad about her getting hit by a car as a child. Kagari thinks that Mato will take Yomi away, so treats her like crap. It\u2019s an unbelievable relationship made even more so by the metaphoric fight that takes place between Mato and Kagari so Yomi will be free. When Kagari is defeated, she forgets everything and seems to act like a normal person. After that, it just gets worse. A girl gets made fun of because she confessed to a guy, the school counselor turns out to have been best friends with Yuu as a child. Yuu hated the real world so much she and her \u201csoul\u201d (her personality in Black Rock Shooter\u2019s world) switched places. It\u2019s a convoluted mess of emotions and nonsensical plot twists that don\u2019t work well. Maybe you have to watch it twice to get the full impact, but this is a review based on my first time watching it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I shouldn\u2019t have to watch it again. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because I missed something that I came out of BRS feeling like a lost kitten. I think it\u2019s the sheer convolutedness of the show. It tries to be an emotional masterpiece, but is instead a fairly nonsensical, and kind of dumb anime. And it\u2019s not dumb because I didn\u2019t get it, it\u2019s dumb because of the things that do make sense. Switching with your soul because you\u2019re scared of the real world? Staying confined to your house and not being allowed to have any friends because of a crazy bitch in a wheelchair you feel bad for despite the fact  she\u2019s a faker?\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the Black Rock Shooter sections because of their action and unique artistry, but otherwise, the story wasn\u2019t that great. It wasn\u2019t smart, it wasn\u2019t adult, if anything it seemed to be aimed at angsty teenagers, especially the bullying parts. Otherwise, I can\u2019t commend the story. I\u2019m sorry to people who did enjoy it and may have understood it, but it was too damn convoluted and the fact that I had to deal with characters crying every ten seconds didn\u2019t  make me all that happy. I might have cared, as I said, if the characters had been built up, but they were never given time to develop and give you a reason to care for them. BRS wants you to feel emotions and be moved by what is happening, and it seems to kind of hinge on that fact. Too bad I can\u2019t be emotionally attached to such cardboard, unexciting characters.\\n\\n\r\nSuch as Mato, who is made to sound like a robot because she doesn\u2019t display emotions. When she does, you don\u2019t care. It\u2019s funny really that her alternate personality, Black Rock Shooter, seems to have more character than she does. Oh sure, she plays basketball and makes friends and does some normal stuff, but the emotional connection you are expected to have with her is never established, so the second half of the series especially is ruined by that very fact.\\n\\n\r\nThe girl she tries to be friends with, Yomi, isn\u2019t much better.  She\u2019s as uninteresting as watching paint dry. She\u2019s being manipulated by a girl she knows is faking the fact she can\u2019t use her legs and for what, because she feels bad about something that happened years before? Yomi has a heart stitched into her chest by the bitch, and yet she puts up with her crap? Oh sure, Kagari threatens to kill herself, but would you really care if she died? Even if you were in that situation I am certain that you would be happy she was dead, so that you could make new friends and be free of those shackles? The shackles are cut, but then Yomi goes crazy thinking Kagari is popular and she doesn\u2019t have Kagari and\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u2026convoluted emotions of teenage girls. Either that, or terrible writing. I still can\u2019t decide.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy early Kagari.  She was crazy, she was a bitch. Watching her push Mato away was hilarious. \u201cYou get all the dirty colored macaroons.\u201d She was the only character with any sort of effective emotions, at least, until she changed and became a goody-goody.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the animation is perhaps the best part of the entire series. Well, half of the animation. The real world portion was not the greatest looking thing, but Black Rock Shooter\u2019s world was gorgeous and the fight scenes were spectacular. Black Rock Shooter and Black Gold Saw, as well as the others, were very distinct and awesome in appearance.\\n\\n\r\nProtecting your friends, carrying emotions, finding the color and happiness in the world. These are lessons to be learned from Black Rock Shooter, and they are conveyed, but not as well as they could have been. I don\u2019t know whether the series should have been longer, or it should have focused on Yuu and Strength more so than the others. I can\u2019t really constructively criticize how the show could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nConvoluted, sometimes exciting, sometimes dull and emotionally challenged, Black Rock Shooter is not as bad as I make it out to be, it has its moments where it does shine, but it is otherwise a pretty basic specimen. It\u2019s safe to say that BRS is decent, but it is in no way something you\u2019ll remember or want to watch again and again. And if that is the case, it\u2019s more than likely to watch the other-reality portions rather than the waterfall of tears in the real world.",

There is a deeper underlying premise to the story that one may not notice at first. This show, from a literary standpoint, is alluding to ones emotional feelings from the actions of the main character through \"cause and effect\" scenarios. If you are looking for an anime that is intellectually stimulating and wish to test your literary knowledge, this is the anime for you. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves side plotsand action/drama fans.\\n\r\nHighly recommend: 8.5/10\\n",

            "content": "The TV series really amused me. You'd think it's just another otaku pandering show made on popularity of a picture of some sort of gunslinger girl with burning eyes, turned into a song and an OVA with a interesting concept. TV series doesn't continue the OVA story, it's a complete reboot, but the basics remained the same. Mato is still the cheerful and energetic girl, Yomi is still shy and quiet, Yuu still plays basketball, and girls in the dreamworld still try to kill each other. \r\nYes, it's yet another school anime, but the writers don't let the audience get bored with the everyday teenagerlife they saw already in thousands of other series. Mato literally dashes trough her life, and the school is a mere point of meeting for the main characters, from where further adventures can go in totally unexpected ways. Every episode girls are facing a new crisis and a new conflict. They often seek the help of the mysterious Saya, who invites the troubled students for a coffee or tea and gives them small advices. Alongside the main plot, there's a huge battle of well armored and equipped girls that symbolise the suffering of each character. Unlike the OVA, the connection between a real and dream world is stronger, and later the plot revolves around that thin boundary, as the heroines learn how to fight with the pain and bad emotions.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is very well done. The sceneries are just beautiful and climatic, and characters perfectly show their emotions with body speak and their faces. \"Fantasy\" battle are done with fluid and over the top CGI. Voice actors did their best to add to the tension and they sound just according to character's current mental state. Both fans of crazy action and artistic scenes won't be disappointed with Black Rock Shooter. A great watch!",

The colors are very vivid, because a theme of the story is 'colors'. The action scenes are pretty cool, with giant rifles and flying macarons or whatever.\r\nThe opening song is a wonderful rock song sung by Hatsune Miku, the virtual diva. Other than that, the music is pretty mediocre.\r\nThe main character, BlackRockShooter, is really amazing and stuff. The other characters are'nt bad,but not as unique. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a great friendship theme, without being too cheesy or preachy. Although it'll probably make you cry.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was pretty impressed by everything. It has a great story in a short amount of time, and is darker and more action-filled than most friendship/slice of life crap. You should definetly watch it!",

Even through all that I still enjoyed this anime and found it quite entertaining.",

Usually is to reduce the levels of both so that the fight is not emptied of allmeaning and the drama is not too emotional. However, by creating a parallelworld, this anime has its own way that is capable of maintaining both sides of the story remains on the characteristics of each. Drama side just makes the fight makes sense, and fierce battles only makes the play even more dramatic. This does not necessarily mean that this animeis better or worse than others, but certainly, the audience will get a truly unique experience.Unfortunately, after establishing a parallel world as the setting, this anime could not answer the question that naturally comes next. How did it originate? Because the relationship between the real world and the world of alternative Mato Kuroi Black Rock Shooter is very strong, it is difficult to accept the explanation that the relationship is 'just there'. As a result, the questions are not answered prevents story to ever really be solid.",

            "content": "This is one of the first anime I watched, and I hold it dear to my heart, but I will try to remain unbiased.\r\nBlack Rock Shooter is an anime with a confusing, thought-provoking plot, weird analogies and doesn't nearly have enough episodes to concisely explain everything it attempts to portray. \r\nYet, all of those flaws can add to the appeal and the utter uniqueness of the entire series. You walk away from the series with questions instead of answers, but those questions are likely about things outside your life, rather than the series itself.\r\nVisually, it's an absolutely amazing anime, with 3D fights, visual effects andartwork off the charts, with some beautiful characters fit for waifu status. After seeing the pretty but rather basic animations from the OVA, returning fans of it will be pleasantly surprised by the fluid and satisfying animation and art style. \\n\\n\r\nThe music for it is good, but i'll readily admit i'm not the first to notice sound or score quality, I'm usually too caught up in the plot to notice.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are notably different from the OVA, but recognizable. The personalities of each character are troubled in different ways, with considerable character development and progress throughout the rather short series. Each character is loved by the watcher at some point of another, even though some's personality development is so severe you feel like you have to specify if you liked the character's personality \"before\" or \"after\" her change. (and yes, it's probably a her. there are no male characters in this series)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i recommend this anime. It's a pleasure to watch and the figurines and merch make it well worth a view for anyone looking to empty their wallet for some amazing figures, (as i readily did once i finished it). I've rewatched it quite a few times and never get bored of it, so if you're ready for a rather interesting experience in terms of plot, and a beautiful experience in animation and character, i recommend this anime tenfold, (and hey, it's eight episodes. what could happen?)",

            "content": "This is my first review so please forgive me if i fuck up a bit. But since i just finished watching Black Rock Shooter and i wanted to say some things from my mind, here i am.\r\nFirst let me get the technical aspects out of the way: \r\nThis show looks and sounds phenomenal. Even though you might not realize it at first glance a lot of the scenes in the other world are full of CGI. Usually i dont like CGI (Arslan Senki) but it works so well in this one. You barely notice the transition between CGI and handdrawn animation and it makes forsome spectacular camera swings. From this day on, when i see CGI i will compare it to Black Rock Shooter. The Art is beautiful aswell with vibrant colours and a different theme for every character. The music fits perfectly in every situation and makes the already great fights even better. I dont like the opening to much but thats always skippable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow I'll talk about the story and characters:\\n\\n\r\nSince you cant divide the story from the characters in Black Rock Shooter i wont take a look at them seperatly. I'd devide the story into two arcs which i'll call Kagari Arc and Yuu Arc. I think most people who watched the show will understand.\\n\\n\r\nKagari Arc:\\n\r\nIt starts of really promising with clearly defined personalities of different characters. There are Mato and Yuu who are both lighthearted friends and dont worry about to much. Yomi seems to be an outsider who cant have friends since her psychotic friend Kagari wants to have her for herself. But Yomi wants to be friends with Mato so they meet and Kagari bullies the shit out of Mato. From here on the characters have to deal with this problem. This beginning was phenomenal since you could see every characters motivation witness how they tried to deal with awful situation in realistic ways. While the main characters deal with emotional problems, they have alter egos in another world fighting the same battles on a physical level. You try to unravel what this world is for yourself. Through the course of this arc nearly all characters develop awesomely and come to a satisfying end.\\n\r\nThe Kagari Arc is some of the best Anime I have ever seen. It has believable characters with relatable motivations and awesome action scenes, even though i prefered the dialogue sequences in the real world. I think everybody can enjoy the first 3-4 episodes of this series. If the series would have continued like this I'd likely given it 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nYuu Arc:\\n\r\nThe rest of the series I cant recommend as well as the first half. I might go as far as calling it a mess. The characters randomly change their personality which is partially due to the plot but feels totally random in other cases (Saya). Unfortunately this leads to the characters not being relatable at all. Also two of the most interesting characters from the first half have nearly no role in the second Arc. There is also a character which dissappears from all peoples memories for no reason. It is here where the other world is explained and the characters can interact with it on their own will. Most of this part of the story is now focussed on this world. The action again is beautiful and has more of a reason in this Arc.\\n\r\nBecause of the random character changes, the predictable and boring ending and the focus on the less interesting characters I cannot in good mind recomend this to a lot of people. Even though the fight scenes are still spectacular the character interactions unfortunately got less in numbers and less interesting. If I would rate this part alone it would probably be a 4/10 \\n\\n\r\nThose are my thoughts on Black Rock Shooter. I might just be to stupid to get the second half but I think I laid my arguments out well. In the end I was disappointed by Black Rock Shooter since it had such an amazing start, but got really messy in the end. I really wanted this to be a 10/10 show.",

            "content": "Anime Review No.14  \r\nBlack Rock Shooter (TV) is the latter version of the 2010 OVA Black Rock Shooter. In a span of 8 episode the anime was expected to clarify the bizarre world of the BRS franchise while the OVA\u2019s is just more focus on the relationship of mato and yomi\u2019s. Black Rock Shooter franchise original came from the character illustration of Ryohei Fuke best known for the pend name \u201cHuke\u201d. The black rock shooter first came out as a 4 minute music video that was sang by a computer software called \u201cVocaloid\u201d , a singing synthesizer, .The vocaloid use was non-other than HatsuneMiku itself. I didn\u2019t known this before when I first watch the OVA but I knew it by the time the new anime adaptation was about to be release. This is the obvious reason why the anime was so hype back then. The anime plot was just simple but it caters massive amount attention of a lot of people. \\n\\n\r\nThere 3 sides so far I see that gives feed-backs to the anime. \\n\\n\r\n1.\tAre the fans that mostly likely the Hatsune Miku\u2019s fans that hype franchise towards the moon and other non-vocaloid fans who just really liked the series. \\n\r\n2.\tThose who have a different perspective. People who dislike the series with reasonable ideals.\\n\r\n3.\tThe Neutral ones that liked it but doesn\u2019t disagree with the 2nd wave.\\n\\n\r\nI stand to the Neutral Side. I don\u2019t disagree for the people who don\u2019t like it since the anime have a fair share number of flaws but I still like the anime.\\n\\n\r\nTime to Start the Overview: \\n\\n\r\nWarning: This text might contain spoilers and I will compare the former which is the OVA version.\\n\\n\r\nArt style and Character Design (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s first with the basic of this anime. The character design of the series of the anime is in the iconic level for you easily remember the looks of the character for they have distinct design different from other characters. From the color, the logo of the clothes, the way they are dress and the weapon they hold the characters looks steps away from a mediocre design that most other anime have that made its easily forgettable. People said that the character design of the anime TV series different from former OVA and I agree. The characters in the OVA have much simpler design unlike the anime series which designs of the characters are cuter but I won\u2019t deny the visual is cleaner because of the higher budget. CGI for the battle scene is good for it feels like you are playing 1080pixel HD Graphic video games which will make you intensify. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design is segregated in two forms:\\n\\n\r\n-\tThe characters Personas are in 3D form meaning the different world is also 3D format while OVA is 2D all the way but even the animation became different it didn\u2019t take away the creative art work in designing the landscape. Spoiler each Personas of the character have different landscape design that matches their personality and even the color fits the moods.\\n\\n\r\n-\tThe base form of the characters or in short the real life appearances of the characters are closely to the standard anime character design of most anime of today. This were complains of the OVA fans came forth. In my opinion it is just a minor detail. Sudden change of character design doesn\u2019t interfere with the series real content so I advise you guys to just ignore. \\n\\n\r\nMusic (8/10) Very Good\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song \u201cBlack Rock Shooter\u201d was sang by Hatsune Mikue herself. The song was cool for the opening and in presenting it themes so the opening is just fine no negative comment added. The Background music for the mood is also fine and good. The Piano background music does really made the atmosphere serious, gloomy and at the same time a little positive. The ending song Bokura no Ashiato is also good ending made by Supercell it\u2019s colorful and the message is direct. The Music did a good job.\\n\\n\r\nPlot (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nTime to check up the major parts of the show. I can on give an above average because there are a lot of circumstances that make the series confusing. In the span of 8 episodes it is highly expected many small details will be left unanswered and will be ignore.  \\n\\n\r\nI going to Summarize the Positive and Negative parts of the Plot.\\n\\n\r\nPositive:\\n\r\n1.\tGiven the duration more team exploration will be made and additional character will be introduced to build up the series unlike the OVA which only focus to Mato and Yomi.\\n\r\n2.\tThe World of BRS will be more explained and these make the anime a little more unique than the OVA. \\n\r\n3.\tIt has a happy ending same as the OVA.\\n\\n\r\nNegative:\\n\r\n1.\tYomi\u2019s family is not explored properly to the point that you don\u2019t know what is happening. How did Yomi suffered in the first place. It\u2019s hard to give sympathy to the characters if you don\u2019t know much about their entire background and this how the plot fails to do it. Even though the plot wanted you to feel sorry for them.\\n\r\n2.\tIt gets more confusing when Strength and Black Gold Saw take in the seen. Black Gold Saw is Irino Sensei persona. Her objective was to collect negative emotion by concealing the girls puberty issues but in reality she just suddenly making it worst and when it was gotten out of hand  and the \u201cInsane Black Shooter\u201d came out she suddenly change of heart. Completely confusing even though it\u2019s was for the benefit of strength it is just too far for an excuse.\\n\r\n3.\tIn the ending the anime became psychological for the main heroine is left to confront and beat up her own self but for some reason it become a shounen for the power of friendship always prevail came about which I think is out of place. The message about hurting others to benefit yourself is there and to clean your mess you have to dirty others and face the entire consequences of your actions is great message but the power of friendship out of the blue is really out of place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10) Above Average\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the other world thing it\u2019s hard to take seriously if the action and emotion of the characters are realistic or superficial in a point. In the plot it is clearly explained the personas of the girl is to protect them to not have an emotional breakdown or protect them from getting more fatally hurt on their emotions but the problem it\u2019s different from the Chariot, Death Master, and Gold Saw. I understood BRS is there for Mato to make her less overthink and not hurt herself and I understood strength purpose for Yuu bullying problems and misfortunate life but Chariot and Death master is the opposite they exist on the sole purpose of not forgetting the pain they suffered and after their personas were killed Yomi and her sister become totally a different person which is another plot hole I want to point out. More minor character details flaw I have seen but I leave that to you guys to decide. The characters did develop here since all their conflicts were resolve in the simplest manner and live life as a better person fueled with the power of friendship.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10)\\n\r\nI like the show but the problem is that there are so many confusing events that I failed to understand. The Music and CGI action did make me enjoy the show but I won\u2019t say much about the characters and the confusing plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) Good\\n\r\nThe anime is not bad and not very good since minor parts of the show was handled properly while the Major parts become extremely confusing which naturally other people to dislike. The message is good but the presentation using power of friendship is awkward since the conflict is internal and personal not social. The show try it\u2019s best to say you\u2019re not alone there is some hidden force protecting from your suffering and that sounds like what I hear and read in our local Christian church. And of course your friends are there to back you up even though the parents here were supposed to have a critical role here to helping their children cope up with puberty and identity crisis. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts about the Comparison about the OVA and the series:\\n\\n\r\n1st the OVA wins in character development and Plot for being simple and understandable unlike the anime series which have flaws that is very hard to ignore. 2nd the anime did make the best of the production values of minor details concerning the music and animation even though the music and animation OVA is also good I put it the balance since it\u2019s only minor details. 3rd last the BRS franchise is good for an action show, and creative presentation in art work. The characters are simple and the plot is simple meaning the anime is average but for me it\u2019s good since the effort for creativity is given consideration and the anime is short enough for you to experience the dullness of slow pacing. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWorth Recommending for a: \u201cSpectacle and for Entertainment purposes\u201d \\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t watch the BRS yet I recommend the OVA since the OVA is still good enough for non-anime fans to enjoy for the action and basic plot and afterwards proceed to the anime series if you wanted a little.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for Reading My Review:\\n",

            "content": "Black Rock Shooter is an anime based off a song by the band Supercell, that got turned into an OVA, a Manga Series and finally a TV Anime.\r\nIt is about 2 girls, one a normal school girl in the real world, the other a girl named Black Rock Shooter in an alternative supernatural universe filled with constant fighting. The style of the show is where what goes on in one world is mirrored in the other world. The real world half could be considered a School, Drama, Slice of Life, Shoujo anime. While the Black Rock Shooter half could be considered an Action, Super Power,Shounen anime. In an interesting way, they kind of work together to be almost a translation of school age girl issues so that boys can understand. But this is only up to about episode 5 when the main plot kicks in.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is good, the art is a little disappointing if you compare it to the OVA. Characters are decent and it is a good anime to watch overall.\\n\\n\r\nFor those that have seen the OVA, this is a retelling of the story. Basically they didn't like the first one and expanded it greatly adding more girls other than Black Rock Shooter and Dead Master. Where the TV series' BRS side is a reflection of what is going on in the real world, the OVA's BRS side was telling the story of BRS trying to save Dead Master after the events of the real world side.\\n\\n\r\nFor those that are reading the Manga, they are totally separate stories, involving the same characters but the premise of the universe different to the point as the stories are mutually exclusive.\\n\\n\r\nI, personally, love the switching back and forth style of storytelling, so was quite happy with it. Some people, I know, do not like this style as it melts their brains which can't handle jumping back and forth between stories. Whether you like it or not probably depends on which side of the fence you are on, but overall it is worth watching if only for the really cool fighting sequences in Black Rock Shooter's world.",

            "content": "Black Rock Shooter is from start to finish a down-right strange anime. I think it generally represents the idea that nice and kind people whose righteousness comes straight from their hearts will always help people even if it costed them their night\u2019s sleep or their current happiness. It also threw hints about Freud\u2019s psychoanalysis; how there is a netherworld, where people\u2019s suppressed emotions are converted into restless champions in constant battle. I will not deny that it does this in a very strange way, which is good, because even if this looks typical to the naked eye, it is far from it.\r\nThe anime ends inan ambiguous manner, leaving you questioning whether the anime had a meaning or a lesson, or was just for entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s the start, and there is the finish, surely. But what happens in between is where all the good stuff\u2019s at!

It\u2019s atmospheric, alright.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint is that it does not feel, only for the main antagonists, the twisted characters who are really sinister, have a decent excuse for them to be so.\\n\r\nHowever, all the characters are in a good way overdramatic.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot isn\u2019t very much engaging, but you\u2019ll be compelled by the extra fine battles, and the responses and reactions of characters.

Watch the OVA, too. \r\nOkay, so, I watched all eight episodes. It didn't take me long since it's really short. But honestly, it was way too short. That's the only bad thing, really. The only bad thing. If you don't like super short anime, then don't watch this one. But if you like sexy girls, then YES WATCH THIS ANIME BLACK ROCK SHOOTER IS SEXY. She is really sexy, honestly. \r\nOkay, so the story is just as it says. But it's areally hard anime to understand. You won't get much of anything until episode 5. It's pretty dark at times, too. And psychological, even. But nothing is explained to you--that's because it's explained later. So before dropping this anime on it's butt--think. \\n\\n\r\nAlso. Around episode 5, things get insane. Pretty insane. My opinion is that after episode 5 is said and done, the anime became amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is great, too. The two different worlds thing was interesting, too. \\n\\n\r\nBy the way, before you even think this is a Black Rock Shooter is a mahou shojo, I'll slightly hurt you because it ISN'T.

            "content": "Watching and reviewing Black Rock Shooter was a complete last-minute thing for me. Since it started well into the Winter anime season, I picked it up on a whim because it looked at least semi-interesting. To my dismay, that's exactly what it was. Semi-interesting, nothing more. I have a pretty neutral stance on this show, I suppose. I've never watched the Black Rock Shooter OVA, but I've heard mixed opinions on it in comparison to the anime series. Judging on how average this show is, I don't think I'll even spend time watching the OVA.\r\nStory [5]\r\nI suppose the story was original for the most part.I just thought that the whole idea was rushed, especially towards the end. That, and some of it just straight-out didn't make any sense. The story is about a girl who fights in an alternate world to fight off her pain in the real world. The main premise seems pretty interesting, right? Well, it would have been, had the producers done it better. This show had a lot of potential just based on the plot summary, but the actual show does not do it any justice. I suppose that, for some, this would be an interesting watch, but it just didn't cut it for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters [5]\\n\r\nThe characters are a bunch of whiny middle school characters with hardly any depth to their personalities. None of them really stood out, save for maybe Kagari in the first few episodes of the show. I found the characters to be rather generic and bland. They had no outstanding traits, which makes for a bunch of rather boring characters.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals [9]\\n\r\nAfter all the bashing I've just done on this show, I have to say that the visuals are the strong point of this show. Maybe not so much in the real world-there's nothing too memorable about the art there. But in the other, alternate world, the visuals are pretty amazing. The battles, weapons and character designs are very nicely done in the alternate world, as well as the background imagery. Even if the plot of it all didn't make much sense, it still looked nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound [7]\\n\r\nBoth the opening theme and ending theme were really good in my opinion. The music throughout the show didn't do much for me, though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [6.5]\\n\r\nI really wouldn't recommend this anime. The first few episodes I actually enjoyed for the most part, but it all goes downhill from there. If you're just looking for some kick-ass battles and animation, I guess you can give this show a shot. But otherwise, it's really not worth the time. (Or, at least, it wasn't for me). It's just one big mess of an anime that's pretty mediocre in my book.",

            "content": "I had seen the OVA episodes when they came out and I liked them a lot! The nicely choreographed fights of the alter egos of the personages were eye candy and the idea of the parallel world interested me a lot the way it was presented. \r\nBut then came the anime\u2026 and I loved it even more! The fights were still great. Even though they might seem a bit over the top at first, I soon got to like them as well. The \u2018real life\u2019 personages got the chance to develop more complicated relationships and the new  personages gave new dimensions to the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and animation\\n\\n\r\nThe exceptional quality shown here is something that comes very close to the top. All aspects of good artwork are there, but BRS stands out in colour, camera angles, light fall, great contrasts and facial expressions. Yes, that is almost everything that makes artwork worth watching. The drawing style might be a bit less appealing to some than the drawing style of Guilty Crown, but for me it worked just fine =)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is an enormously strong point in this anime. Most of all in the parallel world with the perfectly choreographed scenes accompanied by great sound effects. The close ups on the faces of the characters in both worlds were well placed. Slow motion moments in the fights are there, but only when necessary most of the action takes place at a dazzling speed. That is not meant as critics, but more as a compliment, because many details are still visible even with the constantly changing shots.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\\n\r\n(\"This part\" is copy paste)\\n\r\n\"It isn't the world you know. There wanders a girl with jet-black hair, ebony clothes, and a strikingly blue, glowing eye. Her name is Black Rock Shooter. With a huge cannon in hand, she throws herself into a fierce battle...\\n\r\nMeanwhile, in another world, middle-school student Mato Kuroi is drawn to Yomi Takanashi, her classmate with an unusual family name. Mato does her best to talk to Yomi, who just won't open up. Yu Koutari mocks her best friend Mato's efforts but at the same time, supports her. Mato also finds herself surrounded by other colourful characters at school, like the eccentric school counsellor, Saya Irino, and the hot-blooded captain of her club, Arata Kohata.\\n\r\nThen, one day, the window of opportunity opens. After Mato sees that Yomi has her favourite picture book, \"Li'l Birds At Play\", they strike up a conversation and Mato is invited to come over to Yomi's house. There, they gradually break the ice, until a girl in a wheelchair appears. This is Yomi's best friend, Kagari Izuriha...\"\\n\\n\r\nThe plot in this anime is not the strongest point, but still very interesting. The use of a parallel world this way is something I have not seen in any anime, movie or book before. Very original and it kept me wondering how it all was connected to each other. The metaphors used in the story are not always easy to understand, but that is something I like about the anime: It keeps you thinking. I think it is important to save some extra time after each episode of this anime to think about the meaning of everything. It makes things more interesting. Too bad this was only an 8 episode anime. I must say I have never seen a better developed plot in an anime of less than 12 episodes. I actually have never seen a better anime than this one with less than 12 episodes!\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters and their development\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is about character development. The relationships that start and develop, the ones with unexpected, abrupt twists, the connections between all the girls in either the \u2018real\u2019 wold or in the parallel world, the connections between the girls and their alter egos, those are the things that kept me wanting to see more and more. Some characters also have a strong presence. In the very first episode, there was a scene that was more creepy to me than anything I had seen in 'Another'. Emotions of the characters are very strong and those emotions are brought in such a way that I can almost feel them myself.Saying anything more here might become a big spoiler, so I\u2019ll keep it at this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nActing\\n\\n\r\nThe acting was very good in this anime. If you know Ano Natsu, you know the feelings there are strong and they feel genuine; in this anime, feelings are enormously strong and even though you might not see people\u2019s feelings this way in real life, for the anime they felt pretty genuine as well. It is an anime with a dark story and the seiyuus made me feel that. For some of you this way of showing emotion might feel a bit exaggerated, but if you keep watching till the end, you\u2019ll probably understand better why these emotions are so strong.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack (openings and endings included)\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack by Supercell contributes greatly to the awesomeness of this anime. Timing, volume, type of music all fit this anime perfectly if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is sung by Hatsune Miku. That makes this the first anime opening with an artificial voice. I am a fan of Hatsune Miku, and I have known the opening song for a long time, so I\u2019ll leave the judging to the readers: \\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBJUN-lIF7s\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is sung by Koeda. I like the song (composed by Supercell), but for the rest there is nothing special about it: \\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6p2SORPut8\\n",

It's trying to do a psycho-drama and failing miserably.  \r\nThe characters are bland, The script is predictable, the pacing is HORRIBLE, And there is nothing aside from some good CGI for the time and horribly heavy handed metaphor to possibly maybe have a good talking point on this show.  Maybe if I was 16 and still needed a hammer to get a point across to me, but god I hope I was never that dense.\r\nThe basic concepts have strong potential, and with better execution this could have worked well.  As itis I recommended it for the brain damaged the emotionally stunted, and those on way to many drugs.",

            "content": "So this has took me five years to actually finish the show Black Rock Shooter despite it being only eight episodes. Back then, I just couldn't bring myself to watch the dullness of the show's entirety. Reason's to watch, Hatsune Miku and because it's Anime. When I tried the first episode, the show didn't really have a place and I was looking forward to Miku (but there was no Miku except the opening song). I guess we can say that for some viewers, I feel that Miku overshadows the Anime for some folks (like me). At another point, the song created the Anime and theAnime made the song (more alive in a certain perspective.) The whole confuses me when trying to go back and forth from what is what but here we go: \\n\\n\r\n\"Miku. Is. Not. Black rock shooter. THEY ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY. Black Rock Shooter is an anime. Miku just sang the opening. HUKE created BLack Rock Shooter, and someone, inspired by the picture, created a song for her. Once again. BLACK ROCK SHOOTER. IS NOT. MIKU.\ufeff\"\\n\\n\r\nNow that I am back and I successfully watched the entirety of Black Rock Shooter (TV), the show isn't that bad. Just overall (7/10) because of the dullness. Like, I can't really describe it but I would give it a 9/10 but then the show didn't reach my reasoning and the only word that I can think of after finishing it is 'dull'. \\n\\n\r\nThere are parts that are lovely in the story line. Although they just kept mashing into a wall that built frustration within' me about the connection between the girls of trying to attain \"friendship is real\" and \"what exactly are they trying to do here?\" It was like a prolonging of trying to get a sense of reality but at the same time to point out between the action to drama (which I didn't really mind) but it just took a long time to get to the point for eight episodes. To compare this anime, I would compare it to \"A Silent Voice\" because of how annoying the characters are and all the background stories of each character. Though, A Silent Voice (the anime if you haven't seen it yet) is a much better show and more heartfelt. The heartfelt part of BRS is how real the character's emotions are even if they are a bit wonky. \\n\\n\r\nWhat sticks out to me most is how there is a solid \"an internal conflict of fighting your own war\" and \"you are not alone.\" I say it is solid because that frustration that I felt is because I can't understand why do these characters seem like a bunch of idiots that can't get their shit together. Besides that, there also comes in the what I would call 'supernatural/fantasy world' of the BRS that is what makes the Anime seem like a joke because the BRS world is in CGI and gradually the show feels like \"Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica.\" They didn't put in much scenes of the BRS magical world. To put it this way, if you haven't seen the show yet, they have two different worlds where it was built with belief. I think of the belief as a gathering of energy to create more energy of a certain type of energy. That is how I believe that the intentions worked it's way in the story to create that world. By the eighth episode, things were pieced together and it was just an \"ohhh\" type of moment and a bit of \"ouu\" because of how it ended with the break off between the two worlds. I mean, it didn't really break off but the solution to all that happened from episode one is finally over with' having to involve to the build up of about six characters internal conflicts being pieced. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, what I remember is that there are some psychological torture(drama), supernatural appearances, school-life, slice of life. Let's be honest, BRS is a pretty great slice of life. Slice of life because that is how life is sometimes for some folks in real life. Pretty dull. And at most, people do the most questionable things which is why when a mind is broken, things are dragged out for humanity. The psychological torture that came with it is that part that dragged about the story, I feel. Like, shit went down the gutter. :) But that is what made the story to what it is. So, it's great to pick at and wonder what is life! \\n\\n\r\nTo me personally, listening to Supercell's song Black Rock Shooter, I can see how thing's came about. As to the two different worlds and internal conflict. The conflict is one of the same, for it is pain. While the two different worlds could be like a connection of the song and the listener. Where if you listen to Vocaloid and the song meaning, they took the meaning of Black Rock Shooter as a savior to those certain people (girls). And hilariously what got me most and is probably off topic but the show reminds me about a girl that is on her time of the month and just how girls live in general. Life can be hectic but right, that doesn't mean to give up or look down. Anyways, back to topic, BRS being the savior it is whether in song or Anime, it conveyed 'saving' and 'loving' that \"I don't want you to hurt\" and \"let us aim for the stars!\"\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first written review and I'll come back to add more, if so?",

            "content": "The first word that comes to mind when I think about this anime is \"refreshing\". That could be a byproduct of other recent shows I've seen, so perhaps it is a bit biased; however, it best sums up the feeling I have from watching a show that has renewed my love and excitement for anime.\r\nStory\r\nIf you remove all of the intense action that takes place in the \"other world\", you would be left with nothing more or less than what is happening every day in the lives of normal girls (or at least as best as I can guess). Not unlike Evangelion, this show isabout very simple emotions and growing pains; however, what makes this show so enjoyable is that it draws a really extreme view of what those feelings are like as if to remind you what it feels like when you go through them as opposed to watching someone else go through them.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had one reservation in compliments related to story, it would be that it felt like the plot was twisted from what it was originally intended to be. Without going into spoiler territory, the best way I can put it is that I felt that the concept of the two worlds and the separation and synchronization between them was more than enough for the story to be great. That said, the way it was executed was very well done; I still enjoyed all of it including the part that seemed a bit forced.\\n\\n\r\nI always have a love/hate relationship with short series because if I love them, I also hate them for being so short. Unfortunately, it's catch 22 in that it could very well be that the reason the story was so enjoyable was because it was concise. I was excited and engaged from beginning to end (as one would hope for only 8 episodes).\\n\\n\r\nEye Candy? More Like Eye Heroine\\n\r\nAmong all the reviews with varying opinions about the show's overall quality, you will find consistency in how amazing this series looks. I had no idea what I was in for especially with all of the intense action. Anything I could put to words would not accurately represent how overwhelmed I was with satisfaction in how this series looks.\\n\\n\r\nDisney-Tier Music\\n\r\nI'm not an aficionado of any sort in this category, but what I can say is that the music often gave me those same goose bumps you get from Disney movies when the music matches the emotions and intensity of the scene. I felt that it was very well done!\\n\\n\r\nAvailability\\n\r\nI only have one complaint about the show and that's how hard it was to obtain. I couldn't find it on Hulu, CR, or Funimation, and when I went to buy it, it appeared to be out of production (couldn't find it on any of the major US anime retail websites). All I could find was a limited edition bluray on Amazon. It was $300 and came with some bonus mats that are cool and everything, but I would've been happy paying $30-$40 instead of $300. I was worried that it might end up being a show that ended up on a back shelf, but I'm already excited to watch it again. Still, $300 for 8 episodes is definitely the most I've every paid per show.\\n\\n\r\nI very much recommend this show; as I mentioned in the introduction, I really got my fill of great characters, art, music, and story with this one. Oh, and have enough people mentioned how good the action looks yet? Please watch -- if you can find it...",

The story started to go about how everybody is that stupid bird and how the whole other world revolves around that f*cking bird! \r\nwhat a clich\u00e9 Hollywood ending! Seriously horrible!

Though, I enjoyed the fighting parts very much (except for the last fight, screw that!)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nJust what the hell went wrong? \\n\r\nIf you like touching symbolism, you should watch this because this has a massive overkill of that.

            "content": "Black*Rock Shooter (TV) is a spin-off franchise based on an illustration by -\"supercell\" member- Huke, which inspired the songwriter of \"supercell\", Ryo, to create a song for the illustration, which spawned a music video, OVA, an abundance of merchandise, and then this series.\r\nThe story was originally the brainchild of the director, Shinobu Yoshioka. The script writer of this series is Mari Okada, who many would know of from \"Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai.\" (myself included), \"Canaan\", \"Fate/Stay Night\", \"Toradora\", and many more.\r\nShe has a style of incorporating Moe into her characters, as well as realistic character interaction, and decidesto focus on the details of feelings, that most people would look over. She also delves into the territory of melodrama, quite often.\\n\\n\r\nThis particular series focuses on a slew a characters, which is one of its shortcomings.\\n\r\nThe series is only 8 episodes, and there are at least 5 characters to focus on, there's not enough room for explanation, especially when it comes to the melodrama in this series. But I have seen stories handled worse with 13 episode by other writers, so that does show in her ability to write.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is incorporated between two dimensions. The idea of the story is based around a story book that the main character has always liked since she was a kid. A little bird flies across different parts of the world, and collects the different colors the world emulates through it's wings. But the bird collects too many colors, and its wings turn brown and gray, then black, and then the bird dies. Sounds like your general everyday nursery rhyme to me (No, seriously, it does)!\\n\r\nMato Kuroi (alter ego- Black Rock Shooter), Yomi Takanashi (Dead Master), Kagari Izuriha (Chariot), Yuu Koutari (Strength), and Saya Irano (Black Gold Saw). And a few more are introduced along the way.\\n\r\nIt's the beginning of the school year for Kuroi. While she familiarizes herself with her new school, she decides to make friends with Takanashi, who she mistakens her name as \"Little Bird Games (because of the Japanese pronunciation)\".\\n\r\nTakanashi's sister (or friend, or something), Izuriha, is, well, crazy. She doesn't want Takanashi to be friends with Kuroi, because of her conceitedness.\\n\r\nAnd it basically just snowballs to depression, jealousy, deceit, manipulation, rage, ect.\\n\r\nAs you can tell, this show is very depressing. And at times confusing, with plot hole abound.\\n\r\nIn the other dimension, it is only stylized fighting with some narration every now and then.\\n\r\nOver the course of the series, you will understand, or at least be given an explanation, as to how the second world is connected to this reality (particularly in the last 2 episodes).\\n\\n\r\nI will say this. The feelings that these characters express, are definitely real ones. We all have had these feelings over our lifetimes, especially during puberty. But that doesn't mean I want to watch a dramatization of those emotions that I have grown out of. Especially when they're as embarrassingly immature as they are.\\n\\n\r\nI wish the writing was dealt with more maturely, despite the characters age. I have met a lot of younger kids, and they are much more mature than these characters, even with the same problems.\\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems I have with are the adults in this series, they're even more immature than the children (Which is sadly a truth in this world).\\n\r\nOnly an immature adult who cannot level-headedly handle a situation, let alone tackle it at all, could create such a disruption of emotions withing these children.\\n\\n\r\nOn another note, the music, the art, animation, and CGI are outstanding. The seiyuu do an excellent job with their respective roles. The direction of the cinematography is very stylish, and sometimes can evoke an emotional response. But there has to be something there to make it impactful. What could it be?\\n\r\nThe writing. That is where this series falls short.\\n\r\nI think the series would have done much better if they decided to focus on 1 or 2 characters, build up the story a bit, and not have an emotional breakdown over the most menial things. They could also throw the whole \"Other-world\" idea out, or just stay in the \"Other-world\", because no matter what message you send with this anime, you cannot place your burdens on this non-existent entity in true reality.\\n\r\nEnjoy life. Be happy that you have the ability to eat hot food, with clean water, sleep on a soft bed, and have a loving family.\\n\r\nThere are so many people in this world who go without, and just because \"She isn't paying attention to me\" 24/7, does not make it the end of the world. Not at all.\\n\r\nWe all have those stages in life, but I don't think we want to see them again.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all of my complaining about the writing, the story is surprisingly entertaining to watch, but extremely shallow and over the top.\\n\r\nSo if you want to watch this anime, watch it as a step up from a generic, turn your brain off, thriller.\\n\r\nBut the writer makes the story feel more important than it really is, and that will annoy many people who have seen how important stories can be told.\\n\r\nThe ending will make an accusation to face all of lifes trials, and that you can never live without pain, or happiness. But there are many stories out there with that explanation, and they are better told stories.\\n\r\n___\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, the story is very shallow with many holes, so the water of life will start draining out of it.\\n\r\nBut the story is fun to watch, as the art, music, cinematography, acting, and direction are very good.\\n\r\nWatch this as a thriller, with psychological tendencies, and a little heartwarming message at the end, and you'll enjoy it.\\n\r\nBe prepared for the over-dramatic melodrama along the way though, because it's a doozy.\\n\\n\r\nKeep pursuing your dreams! ~ Wynn",

            "content": "Numbers: Story: 5, Art: 6, Sound: 8, Characters: 4, Enjoyment: 4.\r\nI don't think Black Rock Shooter was bad, it was not good either. Truth be told this was one of the most genuinely bland and uninteresting animes I have ever seen.\r\nShort review: \r\nThe show was presented well enough, the art, while uninspired in both worlds, did it's job, while the sound was the strongest aspect. The characters felt bland and not once did I feel like I had any sort of sense of time, I never felt like I understood the character's motives, I never felt like I connected to anyone, and I never feltlike I cared about anything happening at all. The anime felt very mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nLong review:\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a few girls, Mato, Yu, Kotori, and Yumi, doing... something. Find friendship, I suppose. The show never did a very good job of explaining anything anyone did in the show. On top of that the girls never had any reason to do anything they did in this show, besides that they were friends. Now before you go friendship is enough to do something for someone, listen, Mato and Yumi literally know each other for like a month probably (another thing the show didn't do a very good job of was giving you a logical sense of time) and the lengths Mato goes to for this girl are just not justifiable. The argument could be made that she's just a good person, but no. No one is that good of a person.\\n\\n\r\nI can't fault them for what they were trying to do with the story, its something fresh and different, but it was executed quite poorly. The pacing was terrible (I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and say that it was only 8 episodes) and for a talky drama anime, all of the dialogue felt forced. They'd say things to each other, but it sometimes felt like they were robots. Also Mato is overly obsessed with a children's book, to the point of creepy, and talks about it constantly. She always stares off into the distance and says every color she sees, and wants to go see \"the multicolored world.\" Of the children's book. Fiction. Which is stupid. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were by far the weakest part of this series. They were the most wishy washy group of characters I had ever seen. At one point a certain girl screams at another that she can't take it anymore and wants her gone, and the very next episode she is bawling her eyes out because said character is gone. \"I can't be friends with you,\" one girl says. Fifteen minutes later \"Aight, lets be friends.\" It was like the characters couldn't make up their minds on anything, not to mention they were all archetypes, so they didn't have originality going for them either.\\n\\n\r\nMato is the kind caring protagonist, Kotori is nuts and a half, Yomi is lonely glasses-kun, Yu is the cheerful best friend, it goes deeper, but not saying because spoilers I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe (Japanese) voice acting was pretty decent. The actors did the best with what they had. They did a good job conveying the seemingly unwarranted emotion brought on by the writing, and to that I give an applause. \\n\\n\r\nNow before I poop all over undoubtedly someone out there's favorite anime, it isn't all bad. In fact it isn't even bad, just uninteresting. The music is fantastic, every song feels like it fits in perfectly to what was going on (except maybe the show's base, Black Rock Shooter by Supercell, but Supercell rocks so I'll forgive it), and when the show tries to do comedy and action they do them surprisingly well. Action was fast paced and intense, with plenty of flair. The CG is even done very well, its almost barely noticeable. When the show tried to be funny it was genuinely funny, like in a scene where they make fun of the popular shoujo scene of girls running with a piece of toast in their mouth. That stuff was good, but it wasn't there nearly enough, and the show suffers. \\n\\n\r\nThe art felt incredibly uninspired. The shoujo/drama part of the anime looked like any other shoujo on the market, and the main characters didn't even really stand out, except for Kotori, because blonde. The shonen/action scenes had some cool designs, but all of them could have been stripped of their color and thrown in any other shonen ever and fit right in. Except for Black Rock Shooter's design (which was what the show was based on anyway so by all means it should've been good) the other character designs were just bland cut and pastes.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did not enjoy this anime all that much, and by all means I probably should have, but I didn't, I can see why someone would. Its something different, and while I can't wholeheartedly recommend this show to anyone who hasn't exhausted their resources, I can say that it wasn't bad. Just genuinely uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\n5/10",

            "content": "Hate to call a lot of people out and although opinion is individual I'm going to say straight up anyone who rated this anime low was watching it for the wrong reasons or simply didn't get what was going on\r\nas the OVA goes if anyone had a problem understanding what was going on, once again they were watching the anime looking for something that it wasn't offering.\r\nThe series...is about children, not just children but pre-teens to roughly 15....in addition the characters are all females, growing up and learning to deal with their emotions. If you missed that then the anime clearly wasn't aiming at youas it's audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe other world where brs ,strength, dead master and black gold star existed started because of yuu who wanted to run from the pain of reality of the other world embodies the pain of the main characters and the reason why they only fought with BRS is because she was the link between all the girls..now this is where it gets complicated...watching the anime and the development of kuroi mato; she is a kind heart care-free girl with (seemingly) no troubles and emotional pain...as you watch the anime in episode whatever cuz I can't remember. Yuu tells kuroi that she would like to go visit tiny bird( can't remember her name) and without getting jealous or envious or even showing the slightest bit of suspicion mato immediately thanks Yuu for being so kind...this is the kind of person kuroi is....now her link to BRS AND the reason why she wanted to destroy the (pain) others is because that is the person that kuroi is...BRS destroyed the wheelchair girl in the other realm thus forcing her to feel better....where the problem lies in this anime is kuroi (BRS) for not allowing the others to develop and deal with their emotions as the come...remember all the mains are comprised of young teen girls that have to deal with a lot of emotion such as old friendships, new emerging ones, crushes, trust, loyalty to old friends while making room for new ones and most of all letting go...those fighters in the other realm are the embodiments of the bad feelings that develop in these girls\\n\\n\r\nContd - for example in the series. The relationship between kuroi and tiny bird worsens and in the other realm, when the relation hit a breaking point she's encased is anger and chains form around her, getting stronger and thicker. When she finally breaks dead master emerges.\\n\\n\r\nPoint of the anime is about girls growing up in a potentially emotional hostile environment and learning to deal with their emotion as the happen opposed to someone else dealing with them, which gives rise to the other dimension and the purpose of BRS. kuroi loves and cares so much about her friends that she (and BRS)  will do anything to ease their pain. As the anime ended you see BRS fighting herself because she doesn't want to be separated from her emotions. She doesn't want to have her feeling come and go without resolving them herself\\n\\n\r\nI seriously hope that this helps because the action in this anime was far beyond anything I have ever seen since I first watched Venus wars when I was 6 and every anime to happen after that.....I mean common people where talking about dull lengthed fighting scenes here....none of that screen goes black st the moment of impact then a white line slashing the screen only to reveal the victor...that kinda stuff is for mangas, and this truly showed the insane potential fighting amines have\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe OVA clearly states without saying -and even from the first fight between BRS and dead master- that the 2 are connected...finding facial similarities between mato and BRS, is quite easy...and in order to understand why BRS goes searching and fighting dead master you have to simply look at the state of the 2 friends in the real world. Speaking only for myself it took me very little time to understand that BRS wanted only to erase her friends pain (dead master) and the embodiment of it\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone on the future is having trouble understanding I hope this not so quite review straightens certain things out...and also watch NOEIN if you want to understand difficulty of paralleling 2 stories.\\n\\n\r\nThis is for all the people who had overwhelming emotions and wished they couldrun from it...or wished that something else can take on you pain, or wished that someone would take the pain away - that is the sole reason why the other universe exists.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for those wondering why all the other students in the junior high weren't in the other dimension was because the end of the series shows us that it was kuroi(BRS) who united them. The story is about those girls, not every single person in the school\\n\\n\r\nHope this help",

            "content": "This is my first review on this website and I hope you enjoy the read.\r\n(Disclaimer: This is entirely done by a fan of the show and should be read as such. This is purely based on my opinion. If you don't like moe or angst driven anime you will down right hate this show. This show is a hit or miss for reviews and thoughts of the anime. That being said, this show was phenomenal piece of artwork. Though if you think the show is bad then you have that right and are correct in your thinking because the show has flaws just as everyshow. Part of this review will talk specifically about the listed parts which include story, art, sound, characters and the enjoyment level as the conclusion.)\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is extremely angsty that involves teenagers misunderstanding each other and acting on that misunderstanding. Each character has a unique way of dealing with their problems and the angst ensues.\\n\r\n        The world that most care about is often confused as completely separate when first watched. This is not the case at all. The entirety of the BRS universe is a personification of what is happening in the characters lives. Notice Mato and Black Rock Shooter herself is in the middle of the action every time (of course because they are the main character.) Think of these two worlds as being parallel and linked throughout the story and the show will make a lot of sense. Everything that happens to BRS happens to Mato at the same moment. \\n\r\nComplaints about the story: \\n\r\n1. The pacing is extremely fast since the show is only 8 episodes and concludes 5 characters stories. This is where i feel most people start to dislike the series since they become lost before the show even begins. It feels like a more complex Madoka Magica (where simplicity was a major factor as to why that show was amazing) that had 4 less episodes to tell its story. The pacing forced the complex story to be more complex and lost a lot of viewers from being able to understand the story being told.\\n\r\n2. The story is very over the top when it comes to the characters emotions. Each and every character takes the emotional issues they have and throw them vastly out of proportion. But some girls and boys do this during these formative years and eventually grow out of this outlandish look on their lives. Its something I noticed during watching and most reviews point about out as being the major reason they did not like the show. Its middle school girls being angsty and simply blowing things out of proportion.\\n\r\nTotal for the story 9\\n\\n\r\nArt: This is something no one can disagree on. The art is simply phenomenal and is a major part of my personal interest in the show. The back ground is well done in both worlds describing the characters and the emotions they harbor. For example, Chariot has a childish back drop that has been built out of blocks or Dead Master having a very dark themed back ground emphasizing deep depression (and I mean DEEP).\\n\r\nTotal for art 10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound portrays the characters extremely well with the emotions they are feeling. Most of this portion corresponds with the art section but the art was more masterful as a whole than the music.\\n\r\nTotal for sound 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is where the review will start to be more controversial (even more so than the story segment). The characters were well designed and the emotions they emit correlate well with one another very well. The issue is once again these emotions are blown out of proportion. Once again we are talking about angsty middle school girls whose emotions sometimes run rampant. The plot is not that far fetched when it comes to the characters problems. If you are wondering why I am leaving out BRS universe see the story part of the review to understand the requirement, and lack there of, of that specific portion of the show. \\n\r\nThe other portion of the debate is the issue of having very bland or over used character archetypes. Yes its true, these character archetypes are  not original, but I cant think of an anime where there is an original character let alone any other medium for story telling. Look at Gintama for example, Gin specifically makes fun of the comedy genre by saying \"We cant run this show without a straight man\" in reference when Shin attempts to leave. Every type of show has its own method of story telling and require certain archetypes to achieve that goal. This does not excuse the lack of innovation but merely rectifies this not being a major issue.\\n\r\nTotal for characters 9\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show reminded me of Madoka Magica, but is simply harder to grasp. The world building is hard to understand in BRS and as a result leaves a strange taste in the viewers mouth for the first few episodes. Just like Madoka Magica the show needs a little bit to bring everything together. BRS universe is simply out of place in the anime until it is explained. Very similiar with Madoka Magica and the witches and Magical girl concept, the idea had to be built before the story started getting good. It tells a story about the characters growth and should be viewed as such. If you like shows that emphasize emotions I would recommend this show. This isnt a show you can just watch. You have to review some of the content to understand the flow. Just take a few seconds of review about the events prior to being confused and the information should make sense.\\n\r\nTotal for enjoyment 10\\n\r\nMy personal total score for the anime is a 10.\\n\\n\r\nInteresting side note that the cast was amazing.",

Well, because the character first of all, you can really relate, though it depends on what type of person you are. I, me myself, could relate to the protagonist, that is one reason why I gave such a high rating. Second, the whole environment, so emotional, the whole setting of the anime is neither optimistic nor pessimistic, if you get what i mean...x) It might not be the best artistic work or something like that, butthe resource the creators had made the most they could out of it. The story is easy to follow and...well that's what I got.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you are looking for a semi-fantasy anime that includes many emotions, this might be it for you (PS. School girls) (PPS No upskirt, harem or anything, pure innocence)",

Note:this is MY OPINION, and only my own. If you disagree, so be it. But this is mine, so don't be too mad if mine doesn't match yours. \r\nStory 9/10\r\nThe story both feels like, and sounds like Madoka Magica's, except executed worse. But it's unique, like Madoka's. The story doesn't feel mechanical, and it feels smooth, with no plot holes at the end, either.\r\nCharacter 7/10\r\nThis was probably the weakest aspect of the anime. The characters werecli\u0107hed, and it was often predictable on what the main character would do most of the time. But as plot is more important to me in an anime, I never had a real problem with it.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nI HATE 3D. But this 3D actually looked very good, compared to other shows. My only complaint, though I did like it, was that there was too MUCH 3D. I like 3D if it's well designed, like this, but I didn't like the 3D so much that I'd like it in EVERY EPISODE. The anime sections were bland, but well animated.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nI love the OP song. I dunno. I have weird tastes in music. All the songs were good in this anime, and a good chunk of them I could listen to on their own and enjoy them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime throughly. It was a good watch. Good plot, nice art style, and overall just about everything, maybe except for some of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nLike I said in the beginning, I love this anime. Although it had it's number of flaws, I could overlook them, and I was content with the end result and overall happy ending this anime had.(had watched this after Madoka lul :p)",

But I want to make you guys watch it! \r\nSo first the Story is a 9 because u may have to watch this anime more than once.But it's ok DONT panic because its only 8 episodes long! I watched this 6 times to get the story but when I got it it became one of my favourite animes. \r\nThe art is a 10!! The art was AMAZING i thought. Every character was amazingly animated. But the thing is it's not that funny. They make no strange anime faces like when theyre angry or anything they dont make the strange yet funnyfaces AT ALL. But the animation was great i thought most people agree.\\n\r\nSound is 8 the OST's were very cool but not that great. Some were creepy. The battling OST's were the best but the school life OST's were very crappy.\\n\r\nThe characters were a 8 for me. Most characters I didnt like because of either their hair or theyre personality but I liked the two mains the best Black rock shooter herself and Mato.

            "content": "So, Black Rock Shooter (BRS). True, as many critics here and there said, it sure is not the greatest anime, and it feels at first like the story is torn in several directions, and none of them is successfully achieved. \r\nBRS started with a song, done by the now famous vocaloid Hatsune Miku, which was the beginning of the OVA, and then the serie. The main focus was, it seems, the sound and the art part, so it looks pretty stylish, but the story suffered in the OVA. \r\nUnfortunately, the producers decided to continue in the same idea, which was a group of teenage girlsliving their normal lives and dealing with the emotional hardships that come with it. But compared to the OVA, it turns out pretty good, and 8 episodes was a correct bet: long enough to create a proper story, and short enough not to dwell in teenage garbage.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY --  7/10 --\\n\\n\r\nA nice gamble it was, to make a story out of a song and refined visual graphics. \\n\\n\r\nThe story, as said before, is about several teenage girls dealing with emotional problems. It shows us right at the start a parallel world, where girls in there seem to be fighting indefinitely, and it eventually leads us to wonder what are the links between the two worlds, how it works, etc.\\n\\n\r\nIt has several links missing, plotholes and such, added to some psycho episodes, where one can wonder if it as really necessary, or even thought out. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, characters (at least the few main ones) develop a bit more complex personality as the story goes on, and it raises several interesting questions about feeling, relationships and life in general. Something I quite have not expected from a teenage girls anime/moe which started with so many weird and psychedelic episodes/characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt is true that by the end of the anime, we might wonder why so many things are still untold/hidden/forgotten, but it leaves us with interesting questions, only to be solved by our creativity, which in our world seems to be rarer and rarer.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it in a nutshell, a first half a tad disappointing, and a second half much more likeable, and a well made conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nART --  9/10 --\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely a strong aspect of BRS. A feast for the eyes. A big part of it relies on 3D CG (fighting sequences in the parallel world), a wonder. Everything is beautifully designed, and the movement created by the 3D is epic. The 2D part is also nicely done, colors being a bit pale, but it sets the story/atmosphere really well.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND --  9/10 --\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is the song done by Hatsune Miku, the vocaloid, so it will depends on your tastes. I had difficulty at first to listen to it, but then I found it pretty nice. Soundtracks (or should I say sound effects, in fact) supports the fighting scenes/the daily life properly, no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS --  6/10 --\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this is the part I was mostly disapppointed by. Teenage stereotypical girls at first, and then over-dramatic characters around, it definitely felt kind of wrong. And the only \"adult\" present had such a strange behavior it did not by any mean raised the level. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately in the second half the main protagonists start to develop a bit more, but it still is not the strong point of BRS.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL --  8/10 --\\n\\n\r\nFor me, Black Rock Shooter was a great experience. It might be a lot biaised, since I did not have high expectation from it by reading the critics. It turned out in the end pretty good, so it might have affected my judgement. \\n\\n\r\nBRS was an anime where visual/sound effects where almost as important as the story, and it as so brilliantly done in this way that it makes up for the black of consistence in the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, I even liked the story: the suspense kept me wonder about the links between the two worlds, the emotions/suffering of the girls and how it is related to this parallel world, and how it will turn out in the end. \\n\r\nProbably it could have been better if the story was not what it is, but for an 8-episodes anime, it felt like the right choice.\\n\\n\\n",

For reference, I watched the anime before the OVA.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nWhen i first started watching it I was trying to figure out exactly what was going on. Are these parallel universes or dream worlds or whatever. Filling in blanks in an anime is fine, though... until there's too many blanks.\r\nThey tried going for a complex story with complex characters. Sadly the story just ended up being really bad. I could not even accept the \"ending\" they chose. The anime was going at a steady pace and then suddenly BAM developments coming from nowhere near the end of the anime.With little time left they tried to explain some things half assed which is almost as bad, if not worse than not explaining at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBeautiful artwork. The parallel universe seemed was like a well drawn junkyard. Probably the only thing that kept me watching was the fight scenes\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThere were characters and they did have some form of development.

            "content": "This is my first proper review so give me feedback. I'd like to know how i did on it.\r\nOh i remember why and when I started watching this anime. One day, I was listening to a song on youtube and the background picture featured a character from this anime that somewhat resembled a Rule 63'd Rin Okumura from Ao No Exorcist. After some self research (hence looking at the comments section for relevant questions), I found out that this character's name was \"black Rock Shooter\". So i thought, \"that's pretty cool\". So i went up and looked up the anime, and found out it wasspawned from a music video of a song called \"Black Rock Shooter\" preformed by Supercell, who I thought was a good group had some familiarity with. And so, with that I decided to try out the anime\\n\\n\r\nLONG STORY SHORT I FOUND A PIC OF A GIRL FROM THIS ANIME AND DECIDED TO WATCH IT.\\n\\n\\n\r\nnow lets get to the rating shall we! XD\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n-=Story: 6.5=-\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I initially Rated this anime bellow a 7 was because the storyline was all over the place. Characters being thrown in here and there, seemingly out of nowhere. Two worlds that seemingly existed together for no reason, one of which I hated at the time, and the other lacked explanation behind all the violence. However, the world of Black Rock Shooter slowly began to take form into a \"identifiable\" object. It picks up later but this anime could have easily scored an 8 or even a 9 in terms of story; but because of the sketchy beginning of the anime, it couldn't redeem itself. But I'd really like underline the fact that the story picks up and becomes GREAT.\\n\\n\r\n-=Art: 9.5=-\\n\\n\r\nArt? oh art. What can i say? It pretty much doesn't have any flaws to it at all; and even while running on my crappy computer, the artwork pops and stands out, even the animation is great. But the reason it didn't score a 10 is merely because there isn't anything groundbreaking about it. But don't get me wrong, it has minimal flaws and no major flaws. The art for the characters give the art rating an extra .5, The character art really match the characters personalities. The art almost makes up for the characters, I should actually say SAVES, really. (see the .5? they should really add that to the ratings system. xD)\\n\\n\r\n-=Sound:9=-\\n\\n\r\nYou can't really complain about the sound; considering the fact that this anime was originally inspired by a song made by a pretty good band. So in terms of BGM and themes it excelled. The only thing i can complain about is some of the Seiyu's chosen but its not that big of a deal.\\n\\n\r\n-=Characters:6=-\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why it its a 6 and not a 7 is because of how they were added in the story (or should i say thrown in). But the MAIN characters were, in fact, not bad. The MAIN characters are somewhat well developed, and have their own unique background story and personalities. Why am I emphasizing MAIN in main characters? Its because of the next sentence. Sadly, all the qualities of the MAIN characters didn't carry over to the SECONDARY characters. So lets face the facts, the SECONDARY characters are pretty......uh how should i say this..... bad. While the MAIN characters are well done and had the alibi of having a short length anime for their flaws, SOME of the SECONDARY characters had no excuse. SOME of them are essentially only there to explain whats going on in the anime at times, to clear up confusion, and SOME are kinda shallow if you think about it. notice all the \"SOME\"'s? its because there are a few that don't suck. But in the end, the character art compliments the the character rating, giving the character rating an extra point boost, but this is only just so.\\n\\n\r\n-=Enjoyment:7=-\\n\\n\r\nI originally had it at a 6, but i thought about it again, and i couldn't get the ending out of my mind. The fact that the anime more or less redeems itself in the end (in terms of enjoyment ) really becomes a redeeming factor. The final 3 episodes was just that good (at least to me). However, the first 5 episodes were almost a pain to get through. As i said earlier, characters were all over the place; separate storylines which required a veteran anime fan to decipher, characters that's value to the whole couldn't be immediately judged, and many, many things in between. I think the creators tried to make the anime unique, and they succeeded. There are little to no cliched characters in this anime, they may have some mainstream qualities ascetically (or in other words their appearance), but have unique, almost opposite, personality to match with their appearances compared to what most stereotypical animes give to their characters. This anime had me constantly trying to read what type of personality each character had, and with every assumption, I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\n-=Overall:8=-\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this anime is unique. This anime is the type of anime that i hated while i was watching, but loved it after finishing. To truly enjoy this anime you have to look at it in a whole different perspective. This anime will be very difficult to enjoy unless you are used to these type of storylines, or if you decide to change your own paradigm. This anime did very well for its short run. It really broke the mold when it comes to the anime world in more ways than you'd expect. The idea, concept, theme, message, characters, layout, and execution behind this anime is very unconventional. It really opened my eyes up in alot of ways, in both emotional, philosophical, and how I judge and enjoy anime. So if you want something out of your comfort zone, and or want something that wideness your perception of the world and world of anime, this is for you. \\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nFIN. trololololol xD\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When it comes to the origins of an anime, there is usually some sort of manga of light novel involved.  Black Rock Shooter is one of the few shows that deviate from this rule.  Inspired mostly by a song and music video created by the popular Japanese band supercell, it is essentially built around the music itself, rather than the other way around, which makes for a very interesting experience.\r\n     When I speak about the storytelling aspect of an anime, I always consider its premise as well.  Where is the anime set?A school, a dystopia, or the far distant past?  The realm in which things take place is always a determining factor for the feel and tone of the show.  While Black Rock Shooter's concept of \"other halves\" residing in a parallel universe isn't exactly fresh, the way it was executed is.  A world where our mirror selves do battle against each other to shoulder our pain is an idea I'd never seen before.  Also, due to the rather short length of the anime's run (8 episodes), I was impressed with the content they managed to fit inside.  Even with the show's shortness there was weight behind what the characters did and how they felt.  Truly impressive.\\n\r\n     Visuals are certainly a key factor of this show, considering it was birthed from a music video.  The story itself takes place within two universes; the world of the real life humans and the realm of their other halves.  While the depictions of young schoolgirls is rather standard, the scenes shown in Black Rock Shooter's world are much more interesting, though less frequent.  Well done choreographing and well executed concept art is its strength here.  The physical struggles between, for example, Strength and Insane BRS well represent the emotional trauma their patrons experience in the real world.\\n\r\n     Following the path of logic, music is also a key component of a show based on a song.  The audio is great-it sets the right tone and keeps the pacing correct.  A definite strength there.\\n\r\n     Overall, I was impressed by Black Rock Shooter's ability to deliver a meaningful viewing experience in the limited time it had.  Had the show been longer with the same amount of content, I would have been less pleased with it;but I think that is the point.  The story told the message it wanted to and nothing more, no fillers or none sense interactions.  I give it a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\n~Kurai Shiko",

            "content": "The Vocaloid phenomenon has brought us the infamous Miku Hatsune, blue haired internet sensation that she is. Me personally, I'm not a huge fan of Vocaloid music (mostly in that there's auto-tune and then there's AUTO-TUNE, and I can't stand one), but I'll give credit where credit is due- it's created memorable songs and characters that span two continents of fans. But if there is one song that I like, it has to be Black \u2605 Rock Shooter. And lucky me, there was an OVA created that expanded upon her! Fast forward to 2012 and we now have an actual anime series.\r\nHow did it holdup? It had it's problems, but otherwise it was actually better than I thought it would be.\\n\\n\r\n(As a personal side note/help for all newcomers, I would actually suggest watching the 2009 OVA before watching this. It actually will help get you used to the world that the anime takes place in. Plus it looks really freaking pretty.)\\n\\n\r\n(Also, I'm going to use the abbreviations of the Otherworld characters, because I'm just lazy.)\\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10): This is an\u2026interesting story to put behind B\u2605RS (well, interesting if you haven't seen the OVA). Kuroi Mato is our main protagonist (and is connected to B\u2605RS as well), attending school with her friend Yuu. She then ends up meeting Yomi and her\u2026um\u2026friend Kagari, which kick starts the plot. And where's B\u2605RS, you may ask? Well she's in the Otherworld, a world populated by Other Selves of the main characters, and is fighting them for a purpose only she can really know.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself isn't anything really spectacular, in the way that the plot doesn't seem to know if it wants to shock you, slowly build up paranoia, or just kinda appear somewhere. It actually seems to want to follow the storyline that the OVA set out, but it's almost like it gets sidetracked at the beginning. Though, I think that this is more that when they added 2 new characters to the mix (Kagari and Saya), the original plan for following the OVA was thrown into later episodes and they had to spend 3 out of 8 talking about the 2 newcomers. If I had to break it down, the first half is the weaker half story wise, while the second half is much better.   \\n\\n\r\nIt does have the benefit of being very good at running against your expectations, since those first two episodes will make you go O ___ O.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10): I think that this is the first anime that I've watched that has tried to integrate CGI that doesn't make me feel embarrassed for the anime. Seriously, this is by far the best use of CG in a show, trying to show how otherworldly the world that B\u2605RS and the Other Selves fight in. Basically the whole world is unique and interesting to see. But I think that it works so well is thanks to the designs by huke, the original artist behind B\u2605RS. The regular characters look great too, though the redesigns are a bit iffy. Personally I like them all (since they don't deviate too much from the original pictures and the OVA), though I do have to agree that Dead Masters redesign is a bit strange if you're used to her regular appearance. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10): We have the original Black \u2605 Rock Shooter song sung by Miku Hatsune as the opening, which I have to admit, is pretty fucking sweet. Granted, I don't like the Vocaloid auto-tune that you hear throughout the song, but thanks to the music being done by supercell, I can completely forgive it. (Seriously, supercell does an awesome job on this song, especially with the last guitar riff in the song.) The ending was OK, but I never really listened to it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10): Here's where I have my gripes with the show. I have no problems with Mato, Yomi, Yuu, B\u2605RS, DM, Strength, and Black \u2605 Gold Saw. They get good character development and are generally likable or memorable characters. Mato is a kind and excitable girl who wants to help others. Yomi is quiet and just wants a friend to be with. Yuu is much more likeable here than in the OVA, since she gets the added benefit of being genuinely funny. The Other Selves are fighters that get character development later on in the show, but they still have the mystery of who they really are to benefit them.\\n\\n\r\nI don't like about the anime are the characters Saya and ESPECIALLY Kagari. Starting with Saya, her personality is just too hard to get a lock on for too long, so her part in the story later on feels like it just kinda\u2026happened and we have to deal with it now. It's not horribly annoying, per say, it's just inconsistent. \\n\\n\r\nKagari, on the other hand, wasn't really needed in this show. At all. She gets added in as Yomi's 'friend' and in her introductory episodes is creepy and would make a good villain. But then they just end that all in episode 2. So what does Kagari do from there on out? Nothing important outside of leading Yomi farther down the path that she would have gone on anyways had she not been there. And her Other Self Chariot? Disappears till the last episode and doesn't do anything there either. Kagari just feels so horribly tacked on and useless that I'm surprised that they tried to make her such a big part of the cast when overall she does jack squat. (Plus, there's at least 2 canon Other Selves that they could've used, but I have the feeling that they wanted huke to squeeze out a new one for promotional stuff.)  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): This may not be the most introspective show ever, but I'll be damned if I didn't enjoy watching it. The characters have good chemistry and you really want to see where the story takes them. I was intrigued with what the deal with the Otherworld was and how awesome all of the fight scenes in this series were. Plus, you get to see IB\u2605RS, which is pretty damn cool. \\n\\n\r\nBlack \u2605 Rock Shooter may not be the best anime, but for what it is, it's pretty good. It has a strong script, good characters and good designs for them, awesome fight scenes, and is just a fun little ride for fans of B\u2605RS. It has it's weak points, but I think that you can overlook them and enjoy the show. Definitely recommended if you're a Vocaloid/B\u2605RS or Magical Girl fan.\\n\\n\r\nOverall scoring - 7.8/10\\n",

            "content": "(bear with me, this is my first review)\r\nI came into watching this Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) series after watching the OVA and listening to the Hatsune Miku song, so I sort of already knew what I was going to be in for.  Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) is a great story stuffed into too short of a time, but still done well enough to leave an impact.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nLike I mentioned above, Black\u2605Rock Shooter (TV) suffers greatly from too much story to tell in too little time. The first 3 episodes of the series (which I call the \"Kagari\" arc) should have lasted at least 8 episodes inand of itself. The drama and plot started too quickly without letting the audience get attached to the characters. I think part of what saved this arc for me was the fact that I was already familiar with Mato and Yomi as characters.\\n\\n\r\nStill, don't let anyone tell you the storyline is bad. The story is full of well planned twists and turns that keep you waiting with baited breath for the next episode. The use of symbolism is especially good throughout this series, which is to be expected since the world where Dead Master and Black Rock Shooter dwell is where emotions are turned into physical movements and battles. In my case, I saw this story as an interesting take on what happens inside the heads of the depressed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of this series is great. BRS' world is absolutely beautiful. The backgrounds are gorgeous, and the character designs for the \"other selves\" (a.k.a Black Rock Shooter, Chariot, Dead Master, etc.) are well thought out and interesting. While the coloration of the characters is very simplistic, it almost makes sense in the world they live in. The art for this series would be a perfect 10 if not for the rather boring look of the \"real world.\" Also, I don't like that they gave Yomi/Dead Master glasses.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening theme is one of the best vocaloid Miku songs ever made, made by one of the most famous Vocaloid songwriters, supercell (also known for \"The World is Mine\" and \"Love is War\"). The ending theme carries through the symbolic theme for the series as well. That being said, both are kind of forgettable. The soundtrack is good and well placed, but doesn't add much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nAgain, the lowered score can be partially blamed on the short time we have with the characters. The characters are very interesting, and even the throw-away side characters seem to belong in the story. And, in spite of the insanity and depression that seem to plague much of the cast, they all seem very relatable. While some may be irritated at the rationale of these characters, its very interesting to look at it as a person with depression. Many of these characters more vocally struggle with the same feelings many depressed or paranoid teens have.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nIn spite of its flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed Black\u2605Rock Shooter. I am seriously considering a cosplay of Kagari or BRS. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nGive it a try, because this is a must watch.",

It's just like they made four episodes of a series with really cool characters but no point, and suddenly decided they needed a \"moral of the story\" about friendship inserted at the end. *sigh*\r\n--- Action ---\r\nThe combat is bloody gorgeous, the fights are amazing, and the music is fitting. Amazing if you're just watching for this. A 10/10 for the fights alone.\r\n--- Story ---\r\nI began watching this show, loving it. It was mysterious asto how the alternate world related to the real world, and actions performed in both worlds were ambiguous and difficult to tell if they were results or representations from the other world. I loved the show but got the feeling it might turn sour.\\n\\n\r\nThen episode 5 hit, and turn sour it did. The story turned into the biggest \"friendship\" story ever. It leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth because the alternate world is the most unfulfilling reveal I've ever seen. The world was not cohesive, and the explanation for girls was nonexistent. Just friendship and seemingly dynamic characters turned into cardboard cutouts.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters, Enjoyment, and Misc -\\n\r\nThe first four episodes are really enjoyable. I would recommend watching the series just for those. However, the drastic shift in theme of the last four are really quite depressing. Characters are about average, their real world parts are pretty meh with their alternate world counterparts as intriguing but hollow.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyable? Mostly. Worth Watching? Only for the first four episodes.",

There is more depth in the drama particularly with the psychological aspect of it. The storyline is clearer and more relatable compared from before. And more importantly there are tons of moral lessons to learn from; pain and suffering, running away from reality, accepting reality, and most especially the importance of true friendship.\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\r\nThere are new characters to choose from who\u2019s each background are well-explored. Someone can really relate with their different situations. The new characters inthe other world are definitely something to look forward to. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION and SOUND\\n\r\nThe animation is the most memorable with this series even from the OVA. The attention to details with every design, graphic, landscape, and fight scene is just unbelievable. The action is on a whole different level compared from before and any other. The interpretation of different world is so original and brilliant. Plus, the sounds just complete the whole package.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nWith all honesty, I never consider the OVA any special like majority think it was so I wasn\u2019t really expecting much from this adaptation. But I couldn\u2019t be anything but \u201cwrong\u201d. This is something that comes in every hundreds of animes. It\u2019s something that genuinely makes animes elevated. If I have a disappointment, that would only be the \u201c8 episodes\u201d that the series has. I am definitely wanting for more.\\n",

This anime has a SHIT TON of deep symbolism and thought provoking themes... mainly cause of every single fucked up plot twist.The characters are really lively and you feel in love with em really easily, the art style is super cute (at least in the real world) the music is amazing and the fight scenes...

Black Rock Shooter is a beautifully drawn and interesting story that nonetheless falls short due to its lack of cohesion.\r\nWe still have to consider that BRS is only 8 episodes long, something that inevitably affected how much could be done and still manages to come out as an interesting story of accepting life and the pain that inevitably comes with it.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is about what it would be like if little girl's despair (now where have I heard that before?) pooled in an alternateworld where alternate personas representing those girls bore the despair and fought against one another to fix them. As it is looks confusing albeit interesting, with lots of potential interpretations. Sadly it falls flat due to the lack of explanation and numerous plot holes, like why only girls? Why not boys and why there only seem to be personas from a certain age range? \\n\\n\r\nWe have to consider though, as said before, that Black Rock Shooter only has 8 episodes, which forces the plot to rush and makes troublesome to give both the amazing animated battles and story at the same time. Even Madoka had 12 episodes, so BRS would have benefitted from dropping some characters or  preferably, having more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis is where the anime shines as its rendered in two ways, the normal world which is made in 2D and that has an amazing amount of detail, on the level of something like KyoAni would make.\\n\\n\r\nThe Otherworld where they fight is the best part though, with beautifully animated CGI landscapes and dynamic battle scenes that make it possible to feel the action and the effort put into them. For a long time I wondered what it would be like if Madoka's witch barriers were animated by Ufotable, and this is it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music ranges from particularly bland to some good pieces played during the battle scenes. Still nothing particularly notable but neither is it terrible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nHere comes the problem, the anime tries to make us root for the characters and feel the depths of their mental instabilities and insecurities, except its not cohesive in any way. One moment the characters are happy, the next they're on a breakdown, which is why this reminds me of Higurashi (except Higurashi provides a meaningful explanation...). The story doesn't make it very clear how the personas in the Otherworld and the characters in the non-magical world relate, with some being complete opposites of their Otherworld personas and yet, some being exactly alike.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is described by the rest of the cast as a paragon of virtue and a Stepford Smiler yet she's way too open with her emotions and the anime doesn't make her seem as anything special.\\n\\n\r\nFound the deauteragonist \"Dead Master\" annoying but that may also be due to my aversion for yandere characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere's another character that's not what she looks like and that gave a nice twist at the ending, but besides her most characters were strange and couldn't relate with them at all. Once again I assume this is due to lack of time for a good character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe personas would also have benefitted greatly from having a personality but sadly they are as bland as their fights are cool.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt was enjoyable and loved the concept of accepting life and the inevitable pain that comes with it, if it had more episodes and a more cohesive storytelling it might have been able to rival or even beat the likes of Puella Magi Madoka Magica. It was almost there but not quite, hoping for a remake by a more competent director in the future!\\n\\n\r\nIf you want an interesting story about pain (I wish I had something like the Little Bird book in my childhood...) or just plainly want to watch scantily clad girls with baddass weapons beating each other senseless this is the anime for you!",
