You will be befuddled by the juxtaposition of a slice of life high school setting and utterly brutal, gory, monster battles. You will detect no overarching plot and abandon it.\r\nYou will have been a fan of Blood+, and will not like this anyway.\r\nYou will watch the whole series, be extremely upset with the ending and story execution, wonder what was the point of it all, and not like it.\r\nYou will be turned off by the gore and not like it.\r\nI did noneof these things. I enjoyed the fights, visceral and intense as they are. I didn't notice any awkward pacing or choppy execution. I was enamored by the mystery and the ending justified much of the series for me. But I am in a minority.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps I am unusual, perhaps I am just a cretin who didn't realize just how flawed the series was.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I'm wrong about this, but I liked it. You won't. No one else did, and that's okay.",

            "content": "Blood-c is one giant troll of an anime. Unfortunately, it proved so good at the gimmick it used that it chased away most of the audience before the good times started rolling. I was going to give it a stinky 3 by episode five but then I continued watching and by the end it had redeemed itself. Still, that is no excuse for those awful, eye-gouging first episodes. \r\nStory:\r\nSince you are most probably a returning customer to the Blood franchise, you are already familiar with the story. Sword-wielding mystery girl in a high school uniform fights man-eating monsters. Mystery is solved in a gory, splattery,bloody, dismembering, brain-bits-flying, bone-cracking way. \\n\r\nBlood-c has no continuity with the previous anime of the franchise. It takes the basic story and spins a different tale. So, if you, like me, were expecting more Haji\u2014gawd, there can never be enough Haji!\u2014you will be sorely disappointed. Sigh~ (Allow me a moment to once again overcome my disappointment in this crucial omission)\\n\r\nSo, is this a good story? In a word, yes. But that becomes apparent only when you finish it. Once again, the first few episodes are trolling you in a very horrible way. This would have been acceptable in a 24 episode show but in a 12 episode show it did irreparable damage. So, it requires a certain masochism to get you through to the good part. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIt is very difficult to talk about the characters without including major spoilers, so I'll do it this way\u2026\\n\r\nSaya is a high school moe-tard klutz by day and a kickass, monster-slaying, katana-wielding warrior by night. How could that possibly be combined, you ask. Watch to the end and be amazed. \\n\r\nThe rest of the cast\u2014no, I am not being lazy, it has to be this way\u2014are just as they should be. Watch to the end and be amazed. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nAnorexic 7-feet-tall people design courtesy of CLAMP aside, this anime really rocks the fight scenes. Smooth, sleek, gory; these scenes are the main reason to watch this anime. Every time it was blood--fest time it was like the anime became ten times better. Even the animation came alive. \\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nI noticed three distinct soundtrack groups. One for the horrid slice of life wannabe. One for the creepy times and one for the fight scenes. I must say the creepy times soundtrack impressed me the most. It was exquisitely creepy. \\n\r\nOP: Awesome. Fluid and beautifully stylised animation with a standard j-rock ditty. I wish the whole thing could have been like the OP. \\n\r\nED: Boring. I skipped it every time. \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nIt is very difficult to recommend this because it sabotages itself with a horrible beginning but if you are into gory stuff, this will not disappoint. It is not called \u201cblood\u201d for nothing, you know. Some of the brutal stuff I saw popped my eyes out and I was even watching the censored version. I would have liked to see it uncensored but there is no way I'm watching this again. I would rather re-watch Blood+ ...where Haji is. \\n",

            "content": "Soooooo, how do you like your revival of a popular franchise? Ruined or half assed, story wise?\r\nSTORY: Years ago there was an unfortunate case of assault, the victim? Blood the last vampire, a popular movie that spawned an even more popular over-hyped anime series: Blood+, the perpetrator had no motives, it was a cruel and brutal assault in form of a live action, and ever since, Blood has been hospitalized in a vegetative state and was never heard from again... Until...\r\nIn the year 2011 however, a famous group of manga creators, CLAMP, visited Blood in the hospital in order to try to revive it fromit's vegetative state, in form of a new Blood, Blood Clamp AKA Blood C AKA Blood Crap AKA Blood Crazy...\\n\\n\r\nThat's a true story, I swear!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I'll cut to the chase and out right say what we all said: What the fuck happened Clamp? I know we can't trust you girls to make a decent ending for your manga anymore (Tsubasa for example), but now we can't trust you girls to do a remake of popular franchises as well? To be fair, lots of people fuck up remakes, but a lot was expected. \\n\r\nAlright I'm riding Clamp too hard here, it's not all their fault for this failure (I'm being as lenient as possible here), Production I.G. shares some of the blame as well (The series creator is supposedly overlooking the creation of Blood C, but apparently he's letting Clamp do what they want and not paying attention to what's going on).\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I begin with whats wrong with Blood C, the beginning? The beginning? Or the ending? A beginning that drags on for way too long, which isn't a problem... for a 20 something or longer episode anime, Blood C, however, is 12 episodes long (And with a movie coming up too? They'r clearly over estimating their new series)! With 5 episodes of some of the worse character pondering I've seen in a while, in a supposedly action anime fulled with irritatingly dull cliches and Clamp cliches... Which all of it is even more frustrating towards the end with quite a dumb plot twist.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Blood C isn't afraid to waste your time (Some of the characters act like they're self aware of the nothingness that occurs at one point, I guess that's clever, but it ends up more obnoxious than clever and then there are scenes where a voice keeps talking about things don't stay the same forever, they make you want to tone out all the nonsense... Nonsense that is relevant however), it's also not not afraid to push irritating characters, as a couple of twins with no point of being there at all do all the annoying things you expect them to (I'm hoping that I'm not alone in wanting the twins dead... LOL), an emotionless father, and even the main character, Saya, herself! A clumsy school girl with stupid hair (The animators are either lazy or she uses countless cans of hairspray to keep her hair in place outside of the cool looking action scenes) that has a terrible personally swap between serious sword wielding warrior and cute clueless school girl.\\n\\n\r\nBut while Blood C isn't wasting your time (with character pondering), it's showing you spectacular and very bloody (The one it gets perfectly right most of the time) battles. Every episode ends with a fight between Saya and a creature called a Elder Bairn or whatever, often ending up with a bloody shower. These fight scenes are the meat experience of Blood C, they're not battles that you can only experience in Blood C, but they are well animated and well choreographed (Especially the first episode).\\n\r\nHowever, the blood and gore eventually goes over the top, like Fist of the north star or Devilman over the top. But it's so fucking crazy that it's really comical in a way, especially the final episode, it's one of those so bad it's actually kinda good episodes that makes you wish the anime was like this from the start.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the real shame about Blood C, instead of production values, battles, blood, and gore, more time should had went towards crafting a better story or at least one that doesn't feel like a waste of time, especially for the fans of the Blood anime that came before it.\\n\r\nWhile I am not a big fan of Blood+ or Blood the last vampire, there really should have been at least a little more for the fans that watched those series first. Of course that's a good thing that they aren't relaying on using the same elements from those series, apart from Saya, the creature she fights, and a of course the sword she has to use in order to kill the creatures, but at least throw the old fans a bone once in a while, most of the time it feels like Saya is conserving with absolute strangers, at least have one other recognizable character or element that veteran fans can latch on to.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there is one more thing to be said, the later episodes drop a huge ball. Let's just say Clamp has gotten extremely lazy these days and has decided to bring up a plot device from one of their previous series to advance the plot. So when I said that there's nothing for Blood fans to enjoy and be familiar with, there's actually plenty for fans of a recent Clamp title... It's actually kinda infuriating that Clamp would actually do something as lazy as that. \\n\\n\r\nThe story ends up becoming a retarded fan fiction in a way... But never fully embraces it though, it just overlooks it in a way that it kinda has no point in being mentioned at all.\\n\r\nAnother thing that's pretty lazy is the character development and story twists. They are so uninspired that you'd think the creators are making it up as they go along. And the character developments... Let's just say that everything's so half-assed that CLAMP was actually making it proceed in that way just to waste even more of your time... \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Like I said before the fights are well animated (Most of the time), and fans of clamp are treated to clamps distinctive character designs (Skinny, skinny teenagers with long limbs and perfect bodies), But a lot of the characters designs look bland, and Saya's new design looks just plain stupid.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Another thing that actually had effort put in it, the music. It's all great, the fight scenes have great background music to go with them, the voice acting is good, but there's one thing you may want to rip your ears out, Saya has a habit of singing, for a long time, about the most pointless stuff. It's hilarious at first, but later you'd wonder, \"Is that really important for us to suffer through her American Idol try out practice?\"\\n\r\nBut to kinda make up for it, both the opening and ending theme music are great (Leave it to the professionals to do the singing Saya), the opening theme song, Spiral by DUSTZ, will be the one good thing you'll look forward to each episode, and the ending, while not as good, is a great way to end each episode.\\n\r\nAt least this is one thing that Production I.G. cared about.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Cool battles, when they're animated well.\\n\r\n+ Great music and opening theme song.\\n\\n\r\nMixed:\\n\r\n+/- Good animation, and Clamp character designs/ Clamp characters designs, Saya's redesign.\\n\r\n+/- The last episode/ the last and second to last episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Terrible character pondering, such as Saya and her terrible singing.\\n\r\n- Isn't afraid to waste your time with absolute pointlessness.\\n\r\n- Annoying characters, especially the twins.\\n\r\n- Nothing for even fans of the original movie or Blood+ to keep their interest.\\n\r\n- Clamp relaying on one of their previous series for story development.\\n\r\n- No point of the character developments of anyone not named Saya \\n\r\n- Ludicrously violent scenes to the point of being cartoonish and comical.\\n\\n\r\nDespite what I said, I'm actually looking forward to the sequel movie because if the anime continues to go the way the last episode did, at least Blood C will become Blood Cult hit.",

            "content": "[UPDATE]\r\n           Half way done and this is by far the most pissed off I ever got while watching an anime its like watching an action version of a NTR. So many unanswered questions as the plot thickens (if there is one). I feel sorry for the fans of the original. I really can't stand the random deaths that occur in this anime, FANS of BLOOD-C you know what I'm saying because you cant say that you haven't noticed it. Its like you're playing this horrible video games and your at a boss fight and youhave to rescue bystanders (come the f*%k on y when you see a something that looks strange would you wander in its direction if it was me i was hauling ass out of there). No logical was put into the brains of the background characters (pay close attention to episode 6 and point out all the faults I'll point out one pay attention to Nono's appearance look at the street pretty empty for a town filled with shops, businessmen appears out of thin air OH look a random merchant dies what the hell was he doing in that alleyway as he came out running to find out if Saya was alright. You catch the drift.\\n\r\nThe best thing about this anime is that its almost over. I read a couple comments on the forums and what I don't get is how some of you could say 'this is SO much like CLAMP good job with this anime', WTF how is this anything to what clamped has produced over the years it's not even close to what you'll expect from them if you check my list you'll see that all of CLAMPs' production that I've see and those that I've yet to list was some of the best anime and that i really enjoyed it by checking my score. Blood-C you're my rage bar filler and by the time I've finished watching this series i will read a very entertaining novel by a very world renowned novelist to remove the dark spots on my brain.[END OF UPDATE]\\n\r\nFinal review at the end of this anime\\n\\n\r\nThis is what I wanna do after watching this. Cry, Blow my brains out, be resurrected as a zombie and terrorize the living daylight out of the guys at CLAMP.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching 2 episodes of this I am really really disappointed. The story is going no where, its predictable and omg the slow plot and the fact that she's singing please stop, it's the singing that makes me want to roll my brains down Mt. Everest. The time it takes where she is sing can be better put to use like developing a plot with one of the other characters that was introduced in the 1st episode.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone that has seen Blood+ I suggest you watch it to get an idea of what your supposed to be watching and if you have seen it already re-watch the first 2 episode compare it to Blood C and you'll know what a total let down this is.\\n\\n\r\nI will not drop the series because there is still room to see what's gonna happen after all it's only 2 episodes, 'right.' \\n\\n\r\nMy point system based out of 10\\n\r\nCharacter design-\\n\r\n        The fact that she is a supposedly badass, the glasses long squiggly twin tail hair is just plain bad. She fights in the same uniform she goes to school with after going home her father could atleast provide her with a new fitting of clothes along with her sword. (4)\\n\\n\r\nArt design-\\n\r\n        The art isn't bad but it isn't that good either each character was well drawn but they lack the memorable depth that was realized from the Blood+ series. The only memory that gonna stain your brain is that badly drawn hair of Saya. Who knows maybe they'll decide to cut it or remove the wookies that hold it together. (6)\\n\\n\r\nStory-\\n\r\n        JUST PLAIN BAD! ugh. (2). Hopefully this would change after all it's only 2 episodes 'right'.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nThere is allot of room that can change my view of this series, like I've said perviously it's only 2 episodes so far and my review is subject to change after the first arch is completed.

            "content": "This is a spoiler free review.\r\nAlso this is my first review, so be nice. And English is not my native language, so sorry if there are some mistakes.\r\nOk, So this is the third installment in the Blood franchise by Production I.G. Which is a great studio that had done some amazing things, but at the same time it's no stranger to failing miserably, as demonstrated by this particular anime.\r\n*Story*\r\nWell, if you're familiar with the previous 'Blood' installments, you'd know that the premise is about a schoolgirl with a sword who fights vampire-like creatures known as 'Teropterids' in the original movie,  and 'Chiropterans' in Blood+.In this version she fights creatures that are nothing like vampires, but basically just man eating monsters. Which is actually a pretty cool change that I'm okay with. Anyway, Since this is a remake, it goes without saying that the premise nothing new, but to its credit, at least it tries to change it a little bit (though it doesn't pay off, unfortunately).\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is very weak, because it lacks actual content and a lot of the episodes are semi episodic and they don't reveal any significant clue about what the monsters are and what's underneath the surface here. That is except for the last two and a half episodes. That means you can basically watch the first 9 episodes and be none the wiser about what's taking place than you were in episode 1. In fact, you'll only have more questions (though not many since hardly anything happens that seems important). All you have happening in each episode is some boring slice of life/school stuff.. which hardly has any bearing on the plot (and very little on character development) and then it goes straight to the next monster battle.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a weak presentation and despite being a much shorter series it's pacing seems worse than Blood+'s pacing. At least in Blood+ you had 50 episodes in which things actually progress through out them, even if it was a little slow.. Here you have a pointless monster of the week formula, boring dialogue and some minor clues here and there for 9 1/2 episodes and only the remaining 2 1/2 have the meat of the story (which makes it very rushed and badly planned). \\n\\n\r\nSo it probably could've worked (slightly) better if it was just a 6 or 7 episode OVA instead of 12 episodes + a full length movie. Speaking of which, this series might remind you of some bad Gore OVAs from the 80s, but with modern moe girls and pretty boys etc'.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway,  I won't spoil anything, but in the last 2 episodes of the series an insane twist is revealed that was supposedly in plain sight the whole time (which to its credit, was cleverly foreshadowed).  But be warned since it is very farfetched and poorly excused, so you'd most likely be left scratching your head... Yes, even with the poor amount of story it has, it fails to make sense of it. The twist is just a bad excuse for every absurdity in this anime. I did like the basic idea behind it, but it was done very poorly.\\n\r\nOh and it ends with a cliffhanger, so you  have to watch the sequel movie for the conclusion (which was so boring, slow and mostly predictable,  I nearly fell asleep watching it).\\n\\n\r\nSo In a nutshell, the story has little quantity, no quality, a corny and anti climatic conclusion. So yeah, I'm gonna say the story is pretty bad. \\n\\n\r\n*Characters*\\n\\n\r\nThe main character's name is Saya and she has different personalities in each Blood installment. One thing they have in common though is that they all have a badass monster hunter mode and a normal girl mode.\\n\r\nIn the original movie Saya was actually pretty bland, but that was only a 50 min movie, so there's not much time for fleshing out characters. \\n\r\nIn Blood+ Saya had a great personality that was fleshed out properly. She was kinda cute, but I'm sure nobody would argue that she was a moeblob. Besides, she behaved in ways that were very believable and realistic. Pretty much what you'd expect from a teenage girl in that situation.\\n\\n\r\nIn this version on the other hand, she IS more of a moeblob that panders shamelessly to the otaku base. No attempt for realism here.\\n\r\nShe's a cute and sensitive klutz who's good at sports.. So you're probably wondering how a klutz can be good at sports? does that add up? Though I might be wrong here, I really don't think it does.. But who cares!? she's a fetish for fanboys!\\n\\n\r\nBut regardless, even the part about her being \"sensitive\" and \"caring\" which is established quite clearly in the beginning of the series, is thrown out the window later on when she doesn't even flinch at the sight of her friends and others who live in her village being brutally slaughtered by monsters (and notice that this is not when she's in badass mode). \\n\r\nNot to mention that she recovers way too fast after witnessing these horrible deaths. Some of which she could've prevented, but didn't for no reason whatsoever (or rather, the reason is just to show gorey deaths). So the little character development it has is laughable. On top of that, Saya is the only character with a backstory and even the one she has is very lame and vague.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast isn't even worth mentioning. They're all familiar cardboard cutouts you won't care about, and/or just there to die. Oh and the monsters have no personality either. No surprise there though.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are horrendous! \\n\\n\r\n*Art*\\n\\n\r\nI'm personally not a fan of Clamp's artwork and though I know some people are, I doubt even they will claim that Clamp's skinny + moe + bishounen + bright colors art style fits an anime as grim and Gorey as this. \\n\\n\r\nTo its credit however, the animation is fluid and certainly an improvement over Blood+. \\n\\n\r\nAlso the monsters have pretty creative (scary) designs and each monster is unique and fights differently. Much better than the Chiropreran in Blood+. And the monster battles themselves are very well done and with extreme Elfen Lied-style exaggerated gore (actually this is even more Gorey than Elfen Lied).\\n\r\nThe only problem I have with the battles is that Saya could've got a little more injured to make most of the battles less one sided.\\n\\n\r\nThe art's really good overall though not really my cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\n*Sound*\\n\\n\r\nNot much I can say about this department.\\n\r\nThe opening sounds nice, but it has a lot of engrish, which is kind of annoying.\\n\r\nThe ending song is ok, I guess.\\n\r\nThe sound effects are good, but they sometimes feel out of place. For example when Saya clashes with a monster with her sword, it sounds like the monster is made out of metal.\\n\r\nCan't say much about the OST, I guess it's pretty forgettable.\\n\r\nEven though I don't know Japanese, I guess the voice acting's ok, nothing special though.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound as a whole ain't bad.\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment*\\n\\n\r\nThis is a very subjective part of the review, so let's put it this way: if you Like Gore, you will enjoy this. If you like a little bit of moeness and Gore combined you'll enjoy this even more. \\n\r\nThat is of course if you can overlook the quality of the storyline and the characters. Personally? I didn't enjoy it much. The whole thing just felt unnecessarily mean spirited and unpleasant. Don't get me wrong,  there are some nice battles that were fun to look at, but they also felt empty because there isn't much context behind it, and you don't care about the characters involved. In fact, you might end up rooting for the monsters at some point.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall* 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's not the worst I've ever seen, but overall it's pretty damn bad and it takes the franchise a few steps backwards instead of going forwards.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give this series some credit though - it's among the most violent anime I've ever seen (it's insane!). Though the violence in it is stylized differently, it should still be up there together with Genocyber, Violence Jack, Shigurui, the Hokuto no Ken OVA and others.",

I'm a fan of \"a girl with sword fights monsters\", and because of it, I usually am quite forgiving, but this is a truly dreadful show.\r\nIt starts innocently enough - the characters are pretty to look at, and the setting, a small town, a high school and a temple, pleasant enough. The first couple of episodes fool you with a promise of goods that will never be delivered. \r\nThe characters are pretty flat with no development to speak of. I could not bring myself to like Saya, who, as the protagonist, too many times juststood there, watching people, even her friends, die. We can forgive a hero the deaths when they try hard and fail, but watching and not acting is simply indefensible. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems like there was no story to tell - most episodes are repetitive, filled with a battle scene and piling up dead. There is a touch of mystery, as Saya tries to remember some vague promise, which, at this point, just seems like a poor attempt at creating drama.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, there are two things I enjoyed - the art is the only redeeming feature of Blood-C and Saya's song, catchy, but abandoned after the initial few episodes. Both not enough to save the show as far as I am concerned. With just 3 episodes left till the end, I can't imagine anything Blood-C can do to change or improve.",

Most of the /really/ gory stuff in censored, but you still get a general idea of what's happening in the scene.\r\nThe fighting is excellent, Sayasure knows how to handle a sword! I've seen about six/seven fights in the series so far, and each one makes my heart pound when I watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is brilliant, the character designs are very fresh, and go easy on the eyes when you look at them, my favourites happen to be Saya herself, her father, her best friend, and her teacher. The character development is little, but the series still presents enough for you to pick up on.\\n\\n\r\nDon't even get me started on the music, the opening (combining both Japanese, English, AND french) is just amazing, I had to replay it over and over when I first listened to it, the same goes for the ending theme, too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this is a very good series to pick up on, most of the negative reviews are coming from people who are sorely disappointed because Blood-C is not a duplicate of Blood+. I am not a big fan of CLAMP's works but I can say that they really have outdone themselves with this.",

            "content": "Note: This is not really a review, but as what the title suggest, it is an \"episode impressions\". Will edit this into a \"full review\" once the series has ended.\r\nStory: Not much to say here other than what most people probably already knew, that this series has the same concept only in different variation to that already found in the other Blood franchises which started from \"Blood: The Last Vampire (2000)\" and followed by \"Blood+ (2005).\" As an introductory episode, it left me some very good impressions that this anime is something I\u2019ll definitely be looking forward watching week-after-week.\r\nFor the actual episode itself, it beginswith some interesting discussion about the definition of a person then progress to the introduction of the main character and the people around her. All in all the events was pretty standard for first episodes. The highlight of the episode is in the later part concerning Saya's duty which immediately shifted the mood from lighthearted to serious and the fight in the end which have some good slasher moments.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The color tones used are a bit dull but it fits the overall theme of the series which is more on the darker side. Character designs is very CLAMP; the facial features in distant camera shots appears to be detailed so it is something noteworthy for me. The environmental detail is a bit lacking and doesn\u2019t appear HD quality to me but it was offset by the grainy details that are observable in the animation. I like how the battle is animated in the final minutes, very well choreograph although the enemy lacks detail, it just look like a big piece of moving muddy rock, it could be better.\\n\\n\r\nSound: OP and ED themes are good but not something I\u2019ll be listening every time I watch an episode of Blood-C. The soundtracks are however great specially in the fight scene; It composed mostly of tracks that sounds strangely familiar which I may have already heard from somewhere else, but the overall impact are great. The voice behind Saya did a very good job giving life to her character and charm (I like the scene of Saya singing, and I felt\u2026Oh! It\u2019s a wonderful voice), I could also recognize some very familiar voices which I\u2019m excited to hear more as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I\u2019ll talk about Saya, so far I like how she transforms from a carefree individual into someone so BADASS (with that fiery-looking eyes); I\u2019m a person with a natural inclination for female characters with strong personalities, granted she didn\u2019t look like someone fitting that description from the outside, but after witnessing how calm she was battling her opponent, I\u2019m convince that she has it inside her. As for the other characters, not much details are revealed so I it is something I will be looking forward next episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The episode did well and I felt that it did what any first episode should do \u2014- give a good impression to its viewers that will make them look forward watching the series, obviously I have a very good enjoyment on it. Initially, I felt the character design is out of place but after quickly remembering that it is done by CLAMP, my impression quickly rebounded positively. I have watched this episode 3x already before this writing.\\n\\n\r\nUpdates:\\n\\n\r\nep.6: Massive while-lines across the screen, it somehow kills the enjoyment, had to watch the BD versions once it's out.\\n\\n\r\nep.7: Story is getting more interesting in exchange, the animation quality is dropping considerably compared to the first few episodes\\n\\n\r\nep.11: Am I suppose to laugh at these episode? It\u2019s amusing and unbelievably funny, I was laughing from disbelief on all the revelations this episode, the way it\u2019s executed, and the character reactions.\\n\\n\r\nep.12: I say the ending redeems the series for me as it reminded me again that feelings I have from watching episode 1 and other Blood franchises, the very feelings why I watched Blood-C in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m still gathering my thoughts on how to rate this series as it is shown to me, I like to write a proper final impression for Blood-C, it\u2019s a wild ride, but it\u2019s a worthy wild ride.",

The twelve episodes go by pretty fast, this is because you can get really engaged in the action while watching it. My overall rating is 5/10 and I would only recommend Blood C  to those of wantto kill some time and see a bunch action, monsters, and most importantly \"Blood.\" get it...",

Yup, a movie which features Newborn Porn and countless numbers of necrophilia is more fun to watch than Blood-C!\r\nCongratulations Production IG and CLAMP! You made A Serbian Film tolerable! By making the worst iteration of the Blood franchise exist, youguys pretty much made A Serbian Film more tolerable!\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, this is one of the worst anime of 2011. It's up there with Rio! Rainbow Gate and Oniikoto as thee worst anime iof 2011. But atleast Rio! had some decent fanservice to make up for it's shittiness. This? NOTHING!\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing in this series that can make up for how bad it is. Hell, not even Nana Mizuki tries her best to improve this pile of shit. Hell, whenever she talks about cube marshmallows and sing the same fucking song in every episode, you can just hear Nana Mizuki's inner thoughts saying:\\n\\n\r\n\"Seriously, i have to do 12 episodes of this shit. What the fuck am i doing here? I was expecting some xxxHolic and Geass, but i got this?!\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of CLAMP, they did a really shitty job at EVERYTHING in this series. The character designs are really awful, and it doesn't even stack up to their other character designs. And nanase Ohkawa wasn't even trying to make this series better. It's like she just copypasta'd the first half of episode 1 into the other 11 episodes. The writing of this series is so bad that you feel like you're watching a shittier remake of Endless Eight as written by Uwe Boll.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what sound? What music? There's nothing memorable about any of the music of this series. Nana Mizuki's morning song in each episode sucked, and the OP is just some shitty J-Rock filer music by some band i don't even give a shit about.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion: IT SUCKED. It made even the worst film in history look good. it made Mars of Destruction and Dragonaut look like Citizen Kane! I dropped this shit after episode 3 because i'd rather read all the other summaries of the other episodes on 4chan than watching this series. That shows how bad it is. Oh, and i want to cockpunch anyone who claims to like this series. If you even say that you like this series, then you're an asshole and you deserve to lose your genitals just like all the other male characters drawn by CLAMP.\\n\\n\r\nFuck this, i need to go for a drink.",

            "content": "Now that we are almost halfway into the show, I feel I can finally write an almost halfway decent review for this show. \r\nI will be brutally honest; because this show is not Blood+ or Blood the Last Vampire; Because Kai, Riku, Haji (Hagi), David, Diva, Solomon, the entire cast of the old Blood series who had captured our hearts and led us through an epic human drama are all missing. I was disappointed.\r\nProudly wearing my blood-colored spectacles, I admittedly was, from the first episode, biased against Saya Kisaragi. Her goodie-two-shoe personality, her \"Kyou wa ii tenki\" song, the pacing of her story, her oddschizophrenia, her friends, her family, everything about her world just didn't feel right. It didn't feel like Blood.\\n\\n\r\nBut then, as I continued inexplicably to watch this show every week as soon as it came out, realization struck me: Blood C is not a bad show. Hell, Blood C is a good show. Indeed, Blood C doesn't have the dark romance of a soul-bound chevalier. It does lack the harrowing depth of an eon old epic. And it's lead character does not possess the heartbreaking ephemeral delicate elegance of a schoolgirl neither human nor monster. But what Blood C has it has in great volume: entertainment value.\\n\\n\r\nFrom its OP to its ED, Blood C presents a solid music score does its job of setting up the background and atmosphere. Blood C's art style - done in the standard Clamp fashion - has both moments of devious beauty (Saya's smile at the end of the opening) and moments of sheer oddity (Saya's hair-puff, male characters). The animation from Production IG, however, is as always excellent and both complements and compensates for Clamp's art style (which is usually very hit-or-miss).\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of show content, however, the character and story develops slowly. The beginning episodes of the show, admittedly, present us with a rather bland plot and highly Clamp-cliched characters. But these characters, the story, and Saya's world develops and grows (albeit slowly) and, by episode 5, the tide of bloody darkness has already dyed with color the initially monochrome Saya and crew. \\n\\n\r\nThus while certainly not the best show this season (for me, that title is reserved for Usagi Drops), Blood C is nevertheless a solid anime. Saya may not be the most likeable or emotionally realistic character this season, I still find myself intrigued by story. I look forward to seeing what will come of this show next week.",

However, I am not going to be one of those people who will say that Blood-C was \"a giant troll of an anime\" or \"half assed\". Everyone is entitled to their own opinion of what they think of the anime and should not persuade others who are going to watch it, to stay away because they think that it was terrible.\r\nThe story follows a Shrine Maiden, Kisaragi Saya, as she lives a normal school life by down and hunts downand kills these \"Old ones\", who eats humans. In every episode, there is a guarantee that she kills at least one per episode... which is kind of repetitive. In my opinion, the story really starts to pick up towards the end, at around episode 10. In the first few episodes, I was putting Blood-C off, thinking that it was boring. As I progressed further into watching it, I was addicted to it and was intrigued by the end. I hope that the movie will turn out better than the series, and that it will finish.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent in this anime. Although, it was sloppy at times. There wasn't a whole lot of effort put into the art, as it wasn't that detailed. For example: a person is killed and when there is a different angle, you won't see that person that is killed anywhere on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty repetitive throughout the same series. Saya would always sing different songs about her daily encounters, but with the same tune. There wasn't a variety of background music that was used. \\n\\n\r\nFor characters, I would've liked to know some characters a little bit better, like Tokizane Shinichirou. Many of the characters were shrouded in mystery, viewers didn't get to know them. The characters were just... there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was pretty enjoyable. I was really captivated by it near the end. I just wished that the producers would've let it end in the series instead of making it into the movie. Well, since they are getting funded by the Japanese Government, the movie better be good... considering the money spent on this movie could've gone to a better cause.",

            "content": "Oh how the mighty have fallen, CLAMP, one of the most highly regarded group of mangaka, decide that their fame and good word of mouth was just too much. In order to forever scar their reputation, they decide to get their Blood the last vampire/Their own series they made cross over fanfiction animated, and the result?\r\nBlood C, one of the most hideous and disgusting things to have ever spawn from the inter hateful and disgusting minds of beloved manga creators, CLAMP.\r\nHateful? I'll get to that in a minute, but unarguably disgusting no doubt. Where over the top meets pure carnage where even the most torturedsoul from Hostile will be again thrown into a fit of pure agony.\\n\r\nAnd it's only insulting when all of this occurs after you have already gone through meaningless, pointless, time wasting and infuriating six to ten episodes of nothingness. All of that precious time gone, and what do you get in return? Well, you get enough unexplained plot points (Unexplained as in, the explanations are too farfetched to believe in) to reassure yourself that nothing made any sense in the end, an ending that only shown you that you HAVE to watch what comes next for the end of this garbage.\\n\r\nAnd a lot of the frustration, correction, possibly all of the frustration actually comes from the cast of bland throw aways (Literally) and an idiot who fails at level of what a \"hero\" is supposed to do, or for that matter, care about what she should do.\\n\\n\r\nSaya, a bubbly dimwit who loves to sing about what she ate for breakfast, is a high school student of school of essentially food for whatever random monster (Random is the best way to describe it, from giant samurai to raving rabbits on steroids, there is no rhyme or reason for their designs) comes to town fiending for a midnight snack, is quite simply, uninteresting, even at night where her \"father\" sends her to fight the creatures of the night. I'll admit, I found myself rewatching the first episode's beat down for how well animated and choreographed it was, despite some \"huh?\" moments (Her neck isn't broken? That monster's arm must have been made of lead.), to only be pleasantly disappointed by the next round of monster bashing (Monster train car and a tachikoma/Audrey 2 from little shop of horrors hate-off anyone?).\\n\r\nHold on a sec, I lost track of who I was talking about, Saya was it? Well, if I can go on to other things while I should be explaining her character, then my single word description might be dead on, when talking about her good traits... If she had any I guess.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters, meh, ehhhh, bland throw aways? If only that was the absolute case, but for this reviews sake, I'll only say you might as well slap troll faces on the entire cast, even the puppy dog that walks around is full of bullshit and giggles (You have to see it for yourself by how much bullshit it really is).\\n\r\nOh, there I go again, Saya is boring blah, blah, blah... But then there's her bad, no, just horrible traits. For CLAMP, I can only guess they were trying to throw something new into the bag of \"pin the trait on the hero\" party amusement, a trait where she only fails until the last second, but ultimately still failed. But that itself fails on every level, you surprised? You really shouldn't be, because who the hell can root for a failure who, no parentheses holding a snark comment, literally watches everything around torn to bloody desert dishes for the hungry hungry monsters, and literally yells \"I WILL RESCUE YOU!\" or something similar to that. Saya is a character that simply sits around and gets trolled throughout the entire series (In fact her life is simply the product of someone fucking around with her), and fails to protect friends and loved ones, which comes to another point, a one point she protect a classmate who comes out to her by admitting his affection for her, the next episode, he dies, dies a truly pathetic death one befitting a back ground character, and Saya practicably shrugs it off, no joke.\\n\\n\r\nIt's moments like those that made me wonder, characters, like named ones, are dying left and right, like how a nobody stock character would. Many could say there was something suspicious about it, but the reveal is simply a middle finger, mocking you, Saya, the fans of CLAMP and good twists in general. But I could forgive that, as long as there was something to get out of it, maybe the action scenes and battles? Okay episode one sure, but the ending spits on that possibility with nauseating gratuitous gore and blood flash floods, Itchy and Scratchy renditions of overblown proportions that disgust and impress, like an awe inspired crowd that somehow witnessed a septic tank set off like a nuclear explosion.\\n\r\nIt impressed me, that CLAMP would go this far, it's almost... fetishy in a way, like the anime is getting off from from the blood and guts being feverishly devoured, and the last episode enforces that, it's too sickening to think about it any further. I mean, where's the director in all this? Well, he allowed it, in all of CLAMP's bloody desire for violence on a disturbing level, and to the most fucked up way imaginable, especially how people are massacred endlessly in this anime (I will never look at a blender the same way ever again... Urgh, you really don't want to know what a blender has to do with anything in this anime). It'll really get you thinking, like does CLAMP really think in such horrible ways? How fucked up do you have to get to conceive the idea of making mass murders like this series lovably displays? I know of other series that me personally feel like my stomach dropped out of my body (Shigurai is pretty fucked up), but the cartoonish approach to the slaughter isn't just vomit inducing, it's insane with a capital Blerrrgh. %100 unnecessary and %100 flat out gross.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Blood C is ultimately a disgusting gigantic waste of time, I can only recommend to watch it to only to see just how vile it really is, and if you didn't see what was so disgusting about it, I'd probably recommend seeing a psychologist immediately, chances are you might be just as fucked up as CLAMP's bloody horrific mind set.",

The premise of the anime is pretty similar, girl Saya lives among humans protecting them from creatures and can't really say more of the basic premise and how it's similar without giving away spoilers.\r\nBut my point was that the elements of story line are similar, but that's about it. The almost total lack of plot, plot development, character models, character development. Just about anything, it's basically just the elements of story line throwntogether into a mush with filler added. Even the dialogue and ways in which the characters express themselves is dull.\\n\\n\r\nBy episode three I wanted to stop watching, but after reading other reviews and wanting to always give all anime's a chance, I watched tell the end and I got through it. All I can really say is that this was honestly a horrible anime, with the only memorable parts being the gore, the average art, and the strings of storyline that made an awesome anime when they where in Blood+.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like the elements of story line present, and want to see them presented in a much better way I recommend checking out Blood+. Stay away from this train wreck unless you have time to kill and expectations to crush. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let's be honest, Blood C is probably one of the most controversial animes I have seen in all of my time of watching anime. Never have I seen so much bitterness and hatred against a show. Well, let me be the first to present the opposite of the mainstream opinions: I loved Blood C (gasp!) Before you turn away however, please let me explain.\r\nBlood C is literally a creative liberation from the two sister series in the Blood franchise; the only connection (so far) is that they all focus on a girl named Saya who wields a sword and fights monsters. Blood + had 50episodes, and thus had plenty of arcs and time to develop its very large cast- Blood C, on the other hand, at the most, has 12 episodes, and thus uses most of its time to build up atmosphere. Which it excels at, at the expense of fleshing out the secondary characters. Before you rain on my parade, there are a few things to note; Blood C is part of the Blood franchise, which includes the movie Blood; The Last Vampire, and Blood +, the sequel anime show. Please, please stick this in your head now: Blood C has absolutely nothing to do with these two installments. It is a mere sister series with the shadow of the concept. Thus treat this as an entirely new show.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I will put it out forward: Blood C is either a show you are going to loathe or that you are going to love. Most people hated it, some people liked it. I loved it. It is not for people who are looking for interesting fabulous fleshed out characters (this is coming from someone who is the biggest sucker for character development). This is a show that focuses on atmosphere and building it. It is a horror series. It is not an action series, though the action scenes in this show are some of the most creative, well animated ones I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nIt is literally horror at its best- I assure you that if you're a sucker for the type of horror which is more psychological than just pop-outs, this show is for you. If you hate slow build ups, move on. The first half of Blood C focuses on instilling the surreal setting and life of the show into your head. I won\u2019t deny it; the first four episodes or so are pretty dull because they are monotonous; Saya sings a song to school, chatters with her buddies, and fights a monster. What you don\u2019t realize is that this is all- and I mean all of it, pay attention to all the details- for a very good reason, which comes later. This is the part where I admit that there are some flaws; this could have been easily condensed into three episodes max. It still does a good job of developing a very eerie aura though; you have the constant feeling that something is very wrong about this town, and yet you can\u2019t place your finger on it. There's an eerie tension consistently kept despite the seemingly innocuous events; a tension that's about to snap and yet you don't know when or how. \\n\\n\r\nSo whereas the first half spends its time just fleshing the atmosphere and setting of the world Saya lives in, and the latter half spends the next half tearing that world down.  Allow me to present you the latter half of Blood C, which absolutely shines like no other. Halfway throughout this show, you are literally smacked in the face. Repeatedly. In each episode. This is the real deal- you are given cruel reality of the situation; and goddamn, it is cruel. It is merciless. I am not just talking about the gore, which mind you, is on par of that of Narutaru, which has some of the most disturbing scenes I have seen yet. The gore is of course, censored (not the show\u2019s fault, the network\u2019s fault, something which will be fixed when the DVDs come out and dear lord then you can let your stomach churn), but that\u2019s not what makes it horrifying; it\u2019s the way the gore happens, the way no one is spared in this show, the sounds which are so gruesomely realistic. This is not a show for the faint of heart. But the gore is only the sprinkles on the actual cake. The cake is the series of red herrings and plot twists that wrench your heart. You will witness in horror, how everything in front of you, how every trope known to anime kind, is smashed and ripped apart. If anything, Blood C excels at building atmosphere and horror. The fight scenes are as fabulous as they are gruesome.  But yes. Blood C's purpose and key to the show is how it builds up the plot layer by layer, paranoia by paranoia. The villains are completely ruthless, and there is no battle fought without someone dying.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are where things get messy. There\u2019 s two very good reasons why none of the cast except Saya is fleshed out. Nevertheless, they are pretty stereotypical, and are very CLAMPish. But once again; you don\u2019t really end up bothering about them for good reasons. Saya herself is very likeable; you come to empathize with her situation if anything and while you might get irritated with her\u2026.inepititude, at times, you have to understand what she\u2019s going through. In the end, this show is about her for reasons you have yet to find out, so don\u2019t be quick to judge!\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the last, and most important aspect of an anime; how it ends. I have two huge problems with anime, as someone who has seen more than enough for a lifetime.\\n\\n\r\n1.) The ending is rushed. You have no idea how frustrating this is. This is not a tv drama in which a season\u2019s ending can be bad and can pick itself off the ground later on. This is a conclusion and nothing is more irritating and annoying than loving a show only to see the worst plot holes and resolution possible.\\n\\n\r\n2.) Animes that build up to a movie, or huge series, tend to be terrible. Let\u2019s look at two prime examples; .hack//ROOTS was the buildup to the game series, .hack//G.U Trilogy, and it just failed as an individual series because it only left us with very little to deal with and just a fancy commercial to buy the games. Higashi no Eden had wonderful, wonderful potential but got axed by the fact that it was nothing but a mere leg for the two movies to follow. As individual series, these tend to absolutely collapse.\\n\\n\r\nBlood C completely surpasses these two typical faults and succeeds. It paces itself extremely, extremely well; the finale was fantastic and does not leave any open ties that cannot be answered by a movie sequel. The buildup to the finale itself is wonderful, for the most part; while the first part lags a little, it\u2019s not a huge problem and hell, once you\u2019re in, you are stuck in for the biggest ride. Not only does it separate itself as an individual show, and actually solve most of the problems raised in the show and leave a resolution (or many) for it to be complete on its own, but it manages to still raise questions and leave some unanswered so that it can tie itself over with the movie. You are left with a feeling of excitement and resolution; you want to go back and rewatch the series again, but at the same time you\u2019re excited that some big questions are going to be answered in the movie installment.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's even greater is the subtlety- you can go back through this series and catch on the really tiny moments and dialogue that what were once usually tasteless random things, are now essential \u2018oh!\u2019 moments where you realize there\u2019s two (or more) things being said. I\u2019m a huge fan of subtlety and I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m such a passionate fan of this show, and I\u2019m really glad they\u2019re doing stuff like this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBasically, Blood C was fabulous for me. It had the layered buildup of Shiki, the horror of Ghost Hound and themes of Jigoku Shoujo, and gore of Shadow Star. If you like horror, and well paced ones, then totally go for this. It\u2019s not for everyone though, and it\u2019s definitely not for the faint of heart. It takes huge, huge risks, risks that most series would not go for, but it manages to complete the leap and land with a very solid and steady landing.  I personally, I believe Blood C is a remarkable show that pushes the boundaries of the Blood franchise and creates horror by clashing it with the mundane, ordinary life- only making it more frightening than ever.\\n",

            "content": "Blood-C is a lot of things, but above all, it's a very painful series to watch. Is it painful to watch because of how interesting and moving the characters are? I wish I could say that but no, it's painful because I could only take five episodes of this garbage before considering whether or not to outright drop it. \r\nAs a long time fan of the Blood series, I expected a lot more from this show and if I had not been a fan beforehand, I'd likely have dropped this instead of seeing it all the way through. Now don't get me wrong, there's valuein watching this show, but don't expect to actually enjoy it as much as you'll enjoy using it as an example of how 'not' to make a new addition to the Blood franchise. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, at first, the show appears as if it has an interesting premise, using much of the first episode to build up for a potential climax, in which we see our slow protagonist suddenly drawing a blade and butchering some evil dohicky that's likely going to be our show's antagonist. It was built up step by step to reach the climax of the episode, where our bland and boring, yet rather cute protagonist goes through a series of sequences - That she repeats in every single freaking episode for more than five minutes with little to no changes between each one. \\n\\n\r\nNearly -all- of the episodes are the damned same, and not even in a good way that makes you want to continue watching, they're just literally presented in the same manner. I'm not even talking about a Haruhi repetition, this was outright just rehashing the same plot for every episode without changing -anything-, while briefly introducing us to other boring and uninteresting characters, but hey, that's fine. It's in a modern setting, the characters aren't supposed to be especially interesting. - EXCEPT MAYBE OUR PROTAGONIST, who has about as much personality as a walking, singing doll. \\n\\n\r\nMoving along, the action scenes at the end of nearly every single episode are worth watching but not worth the amount of time you have to wait to actually get to them. There's nothing to feel about the monsters she's killing, they're just the generic bad guys that she's been given the duty of slaying by her weirdo father who barely ever speaks to her. The name of the series is Blood,  and they do a good job in nailing that in, OVER AND OVER with gigantic blood baths in every single episode. Now, I liked this at first. If the series has no interesting characters and no change in plot every single episode, I might as well enjoy the gore, right? Wrong! In the versions I watched at least, they began censoring all of the gore about half-way through the damned series. When the Japanese start censoring gore, something just doesn't feel right.I assume the DvD release had an uncensored version but even so, I'm not fortunate enough to be able to afford such a thing and to be honest, I'd never want anyone to spend money on this garbage. \\n\\n\r\nThis series could have been so much better. I like Studio Clamp, I like the Blood Franchise. Clearly, this show is a good example of why you shouldn't try to mix the two together. \\n\\n\r\nOn a more positive note, I like the art. It's nothing spectacular or out of this world. If you enjoy works by Studio Clamp, you'll definitely enjoy the styling of the characters, with those big heads and elongated limbs! No, honestly. They look cute, it's a pity they couldn't have given them personalities at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nIt's filled with blood, blood everywhere, which is fine but at the times I wish they would have taken a more subtle approach in some of the episodes. It might be called Blood but we can see that from the title, you don't have to go all out on us in every episode. The Blood Franchise is more than just a cheesy horror story, just look at Blood+ for an example. \\n\\n\r\nThe monsters look ridiculous, stupid and not a single one of them shares anything in common with the others. I think this would have helped the series a lot if this matter had received just a little more attention. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, if you don't buy the DvD release, you're stuck with the most horrible form of censorship imaginable after the first few episodes. Massive white bars that obscure most of the screen. What kind of garbage is this, Japan? Seriously. Don't censor your anim\u00e9. That's one of the most appealing things about it. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't think much about the sound-track on a personal note but it does fit what's happening in the series, the background music is well chosen and helps to build up the atmosphere. I didn't really think much of the opening and ending songs, they were substandard and completely boring to watch or listen to, likely because the show itself has that effect on people. \\n\\n\r\nI can't say I enjoyed this series and that's rare for me. It does pick up during the last few episodes, more or less the last two, where the plot changes drastically and we have a few nice twists, but I'd say they were executed much too late into the damned series. In a series like this, you can't just throw it all out at the last episode because nobodies going to want to watch it for that long. I also enjoyed a small cameo appearance of another one of my favorite Studio Clamp characters, but you'll have to figure out that one for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly. Just watch it if you have the time, and make a list of why it's a horrendous piece of magnificent stupidity. You'll have fun just doing that. It's always a good conversation topic for the forums too.",

            "content": "WARNING: THIS MIGHT CONTAIN SLIGHT SPOILERS THOUGH I WILL ATTEMPT TO KEEP THEM TO A MINIMUM!!!\r\nAlso, I the first paragraph under each section was based on 3/12 episodes seen.  The second paragraph will be an update based on having seen the series in it's entirety.  I'm just too lazy to actually write something brand new lol.  Anyways, On to the review...\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe story has been weak for me and falls far short of expectations.  I was expecting something dark and similar to Blood+ in many ways but perhaps with a fresh twist, however, what I have seen thus far is basicallya high school slice-of-life drama with about 5 minutes at the end of every episode that give a slight nod to this series' predecessor, Blood+.  I understand this a new series with an alternate take on the story but this pales in comparison to the previous version.  There has been little progression in the story other than through character development (the little that there has been anyways) and there hasn't been an explanation offered for these \"monsters\" that Saya keeps fighting despite already having seen 1/4 of the season.  The story just isn't entertaining and is convoluted and obscure.\\n\\n\r\nThis hold true for about half of the season.  Then after episode 5 the series begins to become a little bit more action oriented but offers even less character development and zero plot progression as a result.  Then an entire seasons worth of plot, build-up and all, is dumped on the viewer in the final two episodes with the last being a gore-fest.  I understand what the story was aiming for and I even understand the approach that as attempted, but I felt the story was just crammed into two episodes at the end thus it rushed to me and failed on it's delivery.  SPOILER: Also,if this matters to you at all, even knowing there is going to be a movie next year, the series ends with information but no resolution.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nAs far as the art design goes it's not bad and on par with other anime.  The animation itself is nothing spectacular with the exception of Saya's fight scenes.  Though a little too dark at times, the animation instantly improves and I will say that I am happy to see fluid sword movements in some scenes without excessive repetition.  Other than that, however, it is basic.  Not bad but not great.  The character designs are ok, though I must admit I am not that much of a fan of Saya.  The hair is just ridiculous for someone who has the responsibilities that she does.  Again, the previous Saya from Blood+ was far superior in this respect again.  Also, for supposedly being a high schooler, Yuuka Amino sure has the design of someone who just stepped out of the russian mafia.  I feel like she is drawn far older than her character is intended to be.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series finished, I pretty much retained the feelings I had after episode three.  Bad character designs and great actions scenes.  Actually the latter became even better.  Especially in the last episode when Saya fights \"Thundercat\".  You'll knw who this is when it happens.  And the ensuing fight scene is probably one of the best I've seen in an anime in a very very long time.  The action is fast, almost \"what just happened\" fast, yet still clear.  The sword movements are swift and non-repetitive.  Overall, the action is the saving grace of this series from an artistic point and I can only hope the action style is incorporated into other anime in the future.\\n\\n\r\nSound:6\\n\r\nI am not an audiophile so for me I look for basic clarity and voices.  I can hear things clearly, so it passes my clarity test lol.  As far as the voice choices, I haven't adored any of them other than Misato Fukuen.  The voice actors are alright and don't take away from the story.\\n\\n\r\nThis held true throughout the series.  An average score for average voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nHere is the big one for me.  What. The. Hell. Is. Wrong. With. Saya.  She is beyond lacking common sense.  She is beyond ditzy even.  She is a whole new level of clueless that is shocking to even have to witness.  She has ZERO awareness as to what's going on around her unless it has to do with that dog, Tokizane, her father, or fighting.  It's painful to see a main protagonist be so absentminded she doesn't even realize that her friends, who are but five feet away from her, talk about her to her face, and then snap into battle mode in the remaining few minutes.  Also, I think that her adoration for her father is kind of odd.  It's a little too much daddy's girl for me.  Not that the show ever hints that the relationship is odd, which I think makes it even more odd since it was probably unintended.  The other characters fall flat and seem bland.  The saving grace to this show are the twins.  They are cute and funny.\\n\\n\r\nThis is about the most interesting part of the series since so much happens in the last two episodes to either change perceptions or reaffirm suspicions.  Saya remains beyond ditzy and clueless till the last episode and everything else would spoil surprises so I will simply say that character development is still extremely slow and uninteresting.  It's hard to relate to characters and care about them when their personalities are so generic and underdeveloped.  However, the last two episodes change this.  For better or for worse is up to you.  For me,it made it interesting.  Most will probably just rage.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nAt least the fight scenes are entertaining, despite the fact I have no clue what she is fighting or why.  Still, as stated above, this is where the animation picks up a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThis hold true thought an explanation is given at some point.  The animation still remains the biggest plus for this series.  The fight scenes are good, even if they are a little sparse in the beginning.  I actually kind of like the \"twist\" at the end.  The deliver was a complete failure and thus this series will be rated very low on average but I like the attempt.  Again I understand the why, but it doesn't change the fact it failed.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nExplained above.",

She is from a family of fighters, and destined for a dark and brutal fate, yet she STILL acts like an annoying, selfish, and naive brat.  \r\nThere really is no plot development until the last few episodes (how many people had to die before that happened I wonder) \r\nThere is no character development. (Sorry, the annoying, pathetic naive main character NEVER gets cooler. At all. Sorry.) \r\nThe only thing satisfying thing in this series, is the amount of gore made from themonsters attacking the humans (while our main character stands there dumbfounded while they tear people apart), if you are into gore and all that. It can get pretty disturbing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this series sucks. Unless you are just in the mood to watch a bunch of ordinary innocent people die in disgustingly brutal ways, you probably won't enjoy it. At all.",

            "content": "Sexy action heroine. Check. School life setting. Check. Gratuitous violence. Check. Monster of the week format. Check.\r\nSo what went wrong here? \r\nWell first of all, there is a serious lack of plot progression in the first few episodes which IMO should be the most important of the story. The first few episodes are the \"hook\" that will make the audience decide whether they will watch the next episode or drop this show. The director and the writer failed at this part. Yes they made a decent 1st episode but the succeeding ones are almost carbon copy of the 1st one with minor variations. Example: Sayaeats her breakfast, goes to school, talks with friends, a random but vague hint/foreshadowing appears and then time to kill the monster of the day. The show basically wasted 3-4 episodes before getting to the interesting part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSecond. The story's pacing. The director and the writer purposely extended a rather simple story by dragging or adding scenes that doesn't necessarily contribute to the plot. Blood-C's story(including the upcoming movie) can fit in a 12 episode format with proper direction and storytelling. There is no doubt about it. \\n\\n\r\nThird. Incohesive story. Blood-C is a mystery story. The plot revolves around the \"truth\" about Saya, the monsters and the town. In order for a mystery story to work the writer must occasionally drop hints at the right time that will create interest or excitement to the story and at the same time reveal a part of the plot a little bit. The show failed at creating interest by hammering the audience with repetitious vague hints/flash backs. How many times have you heard of \"the contract\" or \"the promise that Saya made\"? Did it enlighten you a little bit when you heard those phrase or did it leave you clueless and confused? Only in the last few episodes have we learned about the truth. Was it satisfying? Maybe. Are there any audience left that will watch the \"explanatory\" episode? You know the answer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the action and maybe the fanservice but the story just bored me to death. So in conclusion, Blood-C is one of those anime that could have been something unique and interesting but end up bad.",

I was going to give it a stinky 3 by episode five but then I continued watching and by the end it had redeemed itself. Still, that is no excuse for those awful, eye-gouging first episodes. \r\nStory:\r\nSince you are most probably a returning customer to the Blood franchise, you are already familiar with the story. Sword-wielding mystery girl in a high school uniform fights man-eating monsters. Mystery is solved in a gory, splattery,bloody, dismembering, brain-bits-flying, bone-cracking way. \\n\r\nBlood-c has no continuity with the previous anime of the franchise. It takes the basic story and spins a different tale. So, if you, like me, were expecting more Haji\u2014gawd, there can never be enough Haji!\u2014you will be sorely disappointed. Sigh~ (Allow me a moment to once again overcome my disappointment in this crucial omission)\\n\r\nSo, is this a good story? In a word, yes. But that becomes apparent only when you finish it. Once again, the first few episodes are trolling you in a very horrible way. This would have been acceptable in a 24 episode show but in a 12 episode show it did irreparable damage. So, it requires a certain masochism to get you through to the good part. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nIt is very difficult to talk about the characters without including major spoilers, so I'll do it this way\u2026\\n\r\nSaya is a high school moe-tard klutz by day and a kickass, monster-slaying, katana-wielding warrior by night. How could that possibly be combined, you ask. Watch to the end and be amazed. \\n\r\nThe rest of the cast\u2014no, I am not being lazy, it has to be this way\u2014are just as they should be. Watch to the end and be amazed. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nAnorexic 7-feet-tall people design courtesy of CLAMP aside, this anime really rocks the fight scenes. Smooth, sleek, gory; these scenes are the main reason to watch this anime. Every time it was blood--fest time it was like the anime became ten times better. Even the animation came alive. \\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nI noticed three distinct soundtrack groups. One for the horrid slice of life wannabe. One for the creepy times and one for the fight scenes. I must say the creepy times soundtrack impressed me the most. It was exquisitely creepy. \\n\r\nOP: Awesome. Fluid and beautifully stylised animation with a standard j-rock ditty. I wish the whole thing could have been like the OP. \\n\r\nED: Boring. I skipped it every time. \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nIt is very difficult to recommend this because it sabotages itself with a horrible beginning but if you are into gory stuff, this will not disappoint. It is not called \u201cblood\u201d for nothing, you know. Some of the brutal stuff I saw popped my eyes out and I was even watching the censored version. I would have liked to see it uncensored but there is no way I'm watching this again. I would rather re-watch Blood+ ...where Haji is. \\n",

            "content": "Soooooo, how do you like your revival of a popular franchise? Ruined or half assed, story wise?\r\nSTORY: Years ago there was an unfortunate case of assault, the victim? Blood the last vampire, a popular movie that spawned an even more popular over-hyped anime series: Blood+, the perpetrator had no motives, it was a cruel and brutal assault in form of a live action, and ever since, Blood has been hospitalized in a vegetative state and was never heard from again... Until...\r\nIn the year 2011 however, a famous group of manga creators, CLAMP, visited Blood in the hospital in order to try to revive it fromit's vegetative state, in form of a new Blood, Blood Clamp AKA Blood C AKA Blood Crap AKA Blood Crazy...\\n\\n\r\nThat's a true story, I swear!\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I'll cut to the chase and out right say what we all said: What the fuck happened Clamp? I know we can't trust you girls to make a decent ending for your manga anymore (Tsubasa for example), but now we can't trust you girls to do a remake of popular franchises as well? To be fair, lots of people fuck up remakes, but a lot was expected. \\n\r\nAlright I'm riding Clamp too hard here, it's not all their fault for this failure (I'm being as lenient as possible here), Production I.G. shares some of the blame as well (The series creator is supposedly overlooking the creation of Blood C, but apparently he's letting Clamp do what they want and not paying attention to what's going on).\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I begin with whats wrong with Blood C, the beginning? The beginning? Or the ending? A beginning that drags on for way too long, which isn't a problem... for a 20 something or longer episode anime, Blood C, however, is 12 episodes long (And with a movie coming up too? They'r clearly over estimating their new series)! With 5 episodes of some of the worse character pondering I've seen in a while, in a supposedly action anime fulled with irritatingly dull cliches and Clamp cliches... Which all of it is even more frustrating towards the end with quite a dumb plot twist.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Blood C isn't afraid to waste your time (Some of the characters act like they're self aware of the nothingness that occurs at one point, I guess that's clever, but it ends up more obnoxious than clever and then there are scenes where a voice keeps talking about things don't stay the same forever, they make you want to tone out all the nonsense... Nonsense that is relevant however), it's also not not afraid to push irritating characters, as a couple of twins with no point of being there at all do all the annoying things you expect them to (I'm hoping that I'm not alone in wanting the twins dead... LOL), an emotionless father, and even the main character, Saya, herself! A clumsy school girl with stupid hair (The animators are either lazy or she uses countless cans of hairspray to keep her hair in place outside of the cool looking action scenes) that has a terrible personally swap between serious sword wielding warrior and cute clueless school girl.\\n\\n\r\nBut while Blood C isn't wasting your time (with character pondering), it's showing you spectacular and very bloody (The one it gets perfectly right most of the time) battles. Every episode ends with a fight between Saya and a creature called a Elder Bairn or whatever, often ending up with a bloody shower. These fight scenes are the meat experience of Blood C, they're not battles that you can only experience in Blood C, but they are well animated and well choreographed (Especially the first episode).\\n\r\nHowever, the blood and gore eventually goes over the top, like Fist of the north star or Devilman over the top. But it's so fucking crazy that it's really comical in a way, especially the final episode, it's one of those so bad it's actually kinda good episodes that makes you wish the anime was like this from the start.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the real shame about Blood C, instead of production values, battles, blood, and gore, more time should had went towards crafting a better story or at least one that doesn't feel like a waste of time, especially for the fans of the Blood anime that came before it.\\n\r\nWhile I am not a big fan of Blood+ or Blood the last vampire, there really should have been at least a little more for the fans that watched those series first. Of course that's a good thing that they aren't relaying on using the same elements from those series, apart from Saya, the creature she fights, and a of course the sword she has to use in order to kill the creatures, but at least throw the old fans a bone once in a while, most of the time it feels like Saya is conserving with absolute strangers, at least have one other recognizable character or element that veteran fans can latch on to.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there is one more thing to be said, the later episodes drop a huge ball. Let's just say Clamp has gotten extremely lazy these days and has decided to bring up a plot device from one of their previous series to advance the plot. So when I said that there's nothing for Blood fans to enjoy and be familiar with, there's actually plenty for fans of a recent Clamp title... It's actually kinda infuriating that Clamp would actually do something as lazy as that. \\n\\n\r\nThe story ends up becoming a retarded fan fiction in a way... But never fully embraces it though, it just overlooks it in a way that it kinda has no point in being mentioned at all.\\n\r\nAnother thing that's pretty lazy is the character development and story twists. They are so uninspired that you'd think the creators are making it up as they go along. And the character developments... Let's just say that everything's so half-assed that CLAMP was actually making it proceed in that way just to waste even more of your time... \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Like I said before the fights are well animated (Most of the time), and fans of clamp are treated to clamps distinctive character designs (Skinny, skinny teenagers with long limbs and perfect bodies), But a lot of the characters designs look bland, and Saya's new design looks just plain stupid.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Another thing that actually had effort put in it, the music. It's all great, the fight scenes have great background music to go with them, the voice acting is good, but there's one thing you may want to rip your ears out, Saya has a habit of singing, for a long time, about the most pointless stuff. It's hilarious at first, but later you'd wonder, \"Is that really important for us to suffer through her American Idol try out practice?\"\\n\r\nBut to kinda make up for it, both the opening and ending theme music are great (Leave it to the professionals to do the singing Saya), the opening theme song, Spiral by DUSTZ, will be the one good thing you'll look forward to each episode, and the ending, while not as good, is a great way to end each episode.\\n\r\nAt least this is one thing that Production I.G. cared about.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Cool battles, when they're animated well.\\n\r\n+ Great music and opening theme song.\\n\\n\r\nMixed:\\n\r\n+/- Good animation, and Clamp character designs/ Clamp characters designs, Saya's redesign.\\n\r\n+/- The last episode/ the last and second to last episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Terrible character pondering, such as Saya and her terrible singing.\\n\r\n- Isn't afraid to waste your time with absolute pointlessness.\\n\r\n- Annoying characters, especially the twins.\\n\r\n- Nothing for even fans of the original movie or Blood+ to keep their interest.\\n\r\n- Clamp relaying on one of their previous series for story development.\\n\r\n- No point of the character developments of anyone not named Saya \\n\r\n- Ludicrously violent scenes to the point of being cartoonish and comical.\\n\\n\r\nDespite what I said, I'm actually looking forward to the sequel movie because if the anime continues to go the way the last episode did, at least Blood C will become Blood Cult hit.",

            "content": "[UPDATE]\r\n           Half way done and this is by far the most pissed off I ever got while watching an anime its like watching an action version of a NTR. So many unanswered questions as the plot thickens (if there is one). I feel sorry for the fans of the original. I really can't stand the random deaths that occur in this anime, FANS of BLOOD-C you know what I'm saying because you cant say that you haven't noticed it. Its like you're playing this horrible video games and your at a boss fight and youhave to rescue bystanders (come the f*%k on y when you see a something that looks strange would you wander in its direction if it was me i was hauling ass out of there). No logical was put into the brains of the background characters (pay close attention to episode 6 and point out all the faults I'll point out one pay attention to Nono's appearance look at the street pretty empty for a town filled with shops, businessmen appears out of thin air OH look a random merchant dies what the hell was he doing in that alleyway as he came out running to find out if Saya was alright. You catch the drift.\\n\r\nThe best thing about this anime is that its almost over. I read a couple comments on the forums and what I don't get is how some of you could say 'this is SO much like CLAMP good job with this anime', WTF how is this anything to what clamped has produced over the years it's not even close to what you'll expect from them if you check my list you'll see that all of CLAMPs' production that I've see and those that I've yet to list was some of the best anime and that i really enjoyed it by checking my score. Blood-C you're my rage bar filler and by the time I've finished watching this series i will read a very entertaining novel by a very world renowned novelist to remove the dark spots on my brain.[END OF UPDATE]\\n\r\nFinal review at the end of this anime\\n\\n\r\nThis is what I wanna do after watching this. Cry, Blow my brains out, be resurrected as a zombie and terrorize the living daylight out of the guys at CLAMP.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching 2 episodes of this I am really really disappointed. The story is going no where, its predictable and omg the slow plot and the fact that she's singing please stop, it's the singing that makes me want to roll my brains down Mt. Everest. The time it takes where she is sing can be better put to use like developing a plot with one of the other characters that was introduced in the 1st episode.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone that has seen Blood+ I suggest you watch it to get an idea of what your supposed to be watching and if you have seen it already re-watch the first 2 episode compare it to Blood C and you'll know what a total let down this is.\\n\\n\r\nI will not drop the series because there is still room to see what's gonna happen after all it's only 2 episodes, 'right.' \\n\\n\r\nMy point system based out of 10\\n\r\nCharacter design-\\n\r\n        The fact that she is a supposedly badass, the glasses long squiggly twin tail hair is just plain bad. She fights in the same uniform she goes to school with after going home her father could atleast provide her with a new fitting of clothes along with her sword. (4)\\n\\n\r\nArt design-\\n\r\n        The art isn't bad but it isn't that good either each character was well drawn but they lack the memorable depth that was realized from the Blood+ series. The only memory that gonna stain your brain is that badly drawn hair of Saya. Who knows maybe they'll decide to cut it or remove the wookies that hold it together. (6)\\n\\n\r\nStory-\\n\r\n        JUST PLAIN BAD! ugh. (2). Hopefully this would change after all it's only 2 episodes 'right'.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nThere is allot of room that can change my view of this series, like I've said perviously it's only 2 episodes so far and my review is subject to change after the first arch is completed.

            "content": "This is a spoiler free review.\r\nAlso this is my first review, so be nice. And English is not my native language, so sorry if there are some mistakes.\r\nOk, So this is the third installment in the Blood franchise by Production I.G. Which is a great studio that had done some amazing things, but at the same time it's no stranger to failing miserably, as demonstrated by this particular anime.\r\n*Story*\r\nWell, if you're familiar with the previous 'Blood' installments, you'd know that the premise is about a schoolgirl with a sword who fights vampire-like creatures known as 'Teropterids' in the original movie,  and 'Chiropterans' in Blood+.In this version she fights creatures that are nothing like vampires, but basically just man eating monsters. Which is actually a pretty cool change that I'm okay with. Anyway, Since this is a remake, it goes without saying that the premise nothing new, but to its credit, at least it tries to change it a little bit (though it doesn't pay off, unfortunately).\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is very weak, because it lacks actual content and a lot of the episodes are semi episodic and they don't reveal any significant clue about what the monsters are and what's underneath the surface here. That is except for the last two and a half episodes. That means you can basically watch the first 9 episodes and be none the wiser about what's taking place than you were in episode 1. In fact, you'll only have more questions (though not many since hardly anything happens that seems important). All you have happening in each episode is some boring slice of life/school stuff.. which hardly has any bearing on the plot (and very little on character development) and then it goes straight to the next monster battle.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a weak presentation and despite being a much shorter series it's pacing seems worse than Blood+'s pacing. At least in Blood+ you had 50 episodes in which things actually progress through out them, even if it was a little slow.. Here you have a pointless monster of the week formula, boring dialogue and some minor clues here and there for 9 1/2 episodes and only the remaining 2 1/2 have the meat of the story (which makes it very rushed and badly planned). \\n\\n\r\nSo it probably could've worked (slightly) better if it was just a 6 or 7 episode OVA instead of 12 episodes + a full length movie. Speaking of which, this series might remind you of some bad Gore OVAs from the 80s, but with modern moe girls and pretty boys etc'.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway,  I won't spoil anything, but in the last 2 episodes of the series an insane twist is revealed that was supposedly in plain sight the whole time (which to its credit, was cleverly foreshadowed).  But be warned since it is very farfetched and poorly excused, so you'd most likely be left scratching your head... Yes, even with the poor amount of story it has, it fails to make sense of it. The twist is just a bad excuse for every absurdity in this anime. I did like the basic idea behind it, but it was done very poorly.\\n\r\nOh and it ends with a cliffhanger, so you  have to watch the sequel movie for the conclusion (which was so boring, slow and mostly predictable,  I nearly fell asleep watching it).\\n\\n\r\nSo In a nutshell, the story has little quantity, no quality, a corny and anti climatic conclusion. So yeah, I'm gonna say the story is pretty bad. \\n\\n\r\n*Characters*\\n\\n\r\nThe main character's name is Saya and she has different personalities in each Blood installment. One thing they have in common though is that they all have a badass monster hunter mode and a normal girl mode.\\n\r\nIn the original movie Saya was actually pretty bland, but that was only a 50 min movie, so there's not much time for fleshing out characters. \\n\r\nIn Blood+ Saya had a great personality that was fleshed out properly. She was kinda cute, but I'm sure nobody would argue that she was a moeblob. Besides, she behaved in ways that were very believable and realistic. Pretty much what you'd expect from a teenage girl in that situation.\\n\\n\r\nIn this version on the other hand, she IS more of a moeblob that panders shamelessly to the otaku base. No attempt for realism here.\\n\r\nShe's a cute and sensitive klutz who's good at sports.. So you're probably wondering how a klutz can be good at sports? does that add up? Though I might be wrong here, I really don't think it does.. But who cares!? she's a fetish for fanboys!\\n\\n\r\nBut regardless, even the part about her being \"sensitive\" and \"caring\" which is established quite clearly in the beginning of the series, is thrown out the window later on when she doesn't even flinch at the sight of her friends and others who live in her village being brutally slaughtered by monsters (and notice that this is not when she's in badass mode). \\n\r\nNot to mention that she recovers way too fast after witnessing these horrible deaths. Some of which she could've prevented, but didn't for no reason whatsoever (or rather, the reason is just to show gorey deaths). So the little character development it has is laughable. On top of that, Saya is the only character with a backstory and even the one she has is very lame and vague.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast isn't even worth mentioning. They're all familiar cardboard cutouts you won't care about, and/or just there to die. Oh and the monsters have no personality either. No surprise there though.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are horrendous! \\n\\n\r\n*Art*\\n\\n\r\nI'm personally not a fan of Clamp's artwork and though I know some people are, I doubt even they will claim that Clamp's skinny + moe + bishounen + bright colors art style fits an anime as grim and Gorey as this. \\n\\n\r\nTo its credit however, the animation is fluid and certainly an improvement over Blood+. \\n\\n\r\nAlso the monsters have pretty creative (scary) designs and each monster is unique and fights differently. Much better than the Chiropreran in Blood+. And the monster battles themselves are very well done and with extreme Elfen Lied-style exaggerated gore (actually this is even more Gorey than Elfen Lied).\\n\r\nThe only problem I have with the battles is that Saya could've got a little more injured to make most of the battles less one sided.\\n\\n\r\nThe art's really good overall though not really my cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\n*Sound*\\n\\n\r\nNot much I can say about this department.\\n\r\nThe opening sounds nice, but it has a lot of engrish, which is kind of annoying.\\n\r\nThe ending song is ok, I guess.\\n\r\nThe sound effects are good, but they sometimes feel out of place. For example when Saya clashes with a monster with her sword, it sounds like the monster is made out of metal.\\n\r\nCan't say much about the OST, I guess it's pretty forgettable.\\n\r\nEven though I don't know Japanese, I guess the voice acting's ok, nothing special though.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound as a whole ain't bad.\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment*\\n\\n\r\nThis is a very subjective part of the review, so let's put it this way: if you Like Gore, you will enjoy this. If you like a little bit of moeness and Gore combined you'll enjoy this even more. \\n\r\nThat is of course if you can overlook the quality of the storyline and the characters. Personally? I didn't enjoy it much. The whole thing just felt unnecessarily mean spirited and unpleasant. Don't get me wrong,  there are some nice battles that were fun to look at, but they also felt empty because there isn't much context behind it, and you don't care about the characters involved. In fact, you might end up rooting for the monsters at some point.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall* 4/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's not the worst I've ever seen, but overall it's pretty damn bad and it takes the franchise a few steps backwards instead of going forwards.\\n\\n\r\nI'll give this series some credit though - it's among the most violent anime I've ever seen (it's insane!). Though the violence in it is stylized differently, it should still be up there together with Genocyber, Violence Jack, Shigurui, the Hokuto no Ken OVA and others.",

I'm a fan of \"a girl with sword fights monsters\", and because of it, I usually am quite forgiving, but this is a truly dreadful show.\r\nIt starts innocently enough - the characters are pretty to look at, and the setting, a small town, a high school and a temple, pleasant enough. The first couple of episodes fool you with a promise of goods that will never be delivered. \r\nThe characters are pretty flat with no development to speak of. I could not bring myself to like Saya, who, as the protagonist, too many times juststood there, watching people, even her friends, die. We can forgive a hero the deaths when they try hard and fail, but watching and not acting is simply indefensible. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems like there was no story to tell - most episodes are repetitive, filled with a battle scene and piling up dead. There is a touch of mystery, as Saya tries to remember some vague promise, which, at this point, just seems like a poor attempt at creating drama.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, there are two things I enjoyed - the art is the only redeeming feature of Blood-C and Saya's song, catchy, but abandoned after the initial few episodes. Both not enough to save the show as far as I am concerned. With just 3 episodes left till the end, I can't imagine anything Blood-C can do to change or improve.",

Most of the /really/ gory stuff in censored, but you still get a general idea of what's happening in the scene.\r\nThe fighting is excellent, Sayasure knows how to handle a sword! I've seen about six/seven fights in the series so far, and each one makes my heart pound when I watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is brilliant, the character designs are very fresh, and go easy on the eyes when you look at them, my favourites happen to be Saya herself, her father, her best friend, and her teacher. The character development is little, but the series still presents enough for you to pick up on.\\n\\n\r\nDon't even get me started on the music, the opening (combining both Japanese, English, AND french) is just amazing, I had to replay it over and over when I first listened to it, the same goes for the ending theme, too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this is a very good series to pick up on, most of the negative reviews are coming from people who are sorely disappointed because Blood-C is not a duplicate of Blood+. I am not a big fan of CLAMP's works but I can say that they really have outdone themselves with this.",

            "content": "Note: This is not really a review, but as what the title suggest, it is an \"episode impressions\". Will edit this into a \"full review\" once the series has ended.\r\nStory: Not much to say here other than what most people probably already knew, that this series has the same concept only in different variation to that already found in the other Blood franchises which started from \"Blood: The Last Vampire (2000)\" and followed by \"Blood+ (2005).\" As an introductory episode, it left me some very good impressions that this anime is something I\u2019ll definitely be looking forward watching week-after-week.\r\nFor the actual episode itself, it beginswith some interesting discussion about the definition of a person then progress to the introduction of the main character and the people around her. All in all the events was pretty standard for first episodes. The highlight of the episode is in the later part concerning Saya's duty which immediately shifted the mood from lighthearted to serious and the fight in the end which have some good slasher moments.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The color tones used are a bit dull but it fits the overall theme of the series which is more on the darker side. Character designs is very CLAMP; the facial features in distant camera shots appears to be detailed so it is something noteworthy for me. The environmental detail is a bit lacking and doesn\u2019t appear HD quality to me but it was offset by the grainy details that are observable in the animation. I like how the battle is animated in the final minutes, very well choreograph although the enemy lacks detail, it just look like a big piece of moving muddy rock, it could be better.\\n\\n\r\nSound: OP and ED themes are good but not something I\u2019ll be listening every time I watch an episode of Blood-C. The soundtracks are however great specially in the fight scene; It composed mostly of tracks that sounds strangely familiar which I may have already heard from somewhere else, but the overall impact are great. The voice behind Saya did a very good job giving life to her character and charm (I like the scene of Saya singing, and I felt\u2026Oh! It\u2019s a wonderful voice), I could also recognize some very familiar voices which I\u2019m excited to hear more as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I\u2019ll talk about Saya, so far I like how she transforms from a carefree individual into someone so BADASS (with that fiery-looking eyes); I\u2019m a person with a natural inclination for female characters with strong personalities, granted she didn\u2019t look like someone fitting that description from the outside, but after witnessing how calm she was battling her opponent, I\u2019m convince that she has it inside her. As for the other characters, not much details are revealed so I it is something I will be looking forward next episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The episode did well and I felt that it did what any first episode should do \u2014- give a good impression to its viewers that will make them look forward watching the series, obviously I have a very good enjoyment on it. Initially, I felt the character design is out of place but after quickly remembering that it is done by CLAMP, my impression quickly rebounded positively. I have watched this episode 3x already before this writing.\\n\\n\r\nUpdates:\\n\\n\r\nep.6: Massive while-lines across the screen, it somehow kills the enjoyment, had to watch the BD versions once it's out.\\n\\n\r\nep.7: Story is getting more interesting in exchange, the animation quality is dropping considerably compared to the first few episodes\\n\\n\r\nep.11: Am I suppose to laugh at these episode? It\u2019s amusing and unbelievably funny, I was laughing from disbelief on all the revelations this episode, the way it\u2019s executed, and the character reactions.\\n\\n\r\nep.12: I say the ending redeems the series for me as it reminded me again that feelings I have from watching episode 1 and other Blood franchises, the very feelings why I watched Blood-C in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m still gathering my thoughts on how to rate this series as it is shown to me, I like to write a proper final impression for Blood-C, it\u2019s a wild ride, but it\u2019s a worthy wild ride.",

This show is very repetitive up until the end. However the only good thing I will say about Blood C is that it's very action packed (GRAPHIC) and very fast paced. Short too. The twelve episodes go by pretty fast, this is because you can get really engaged in the action while watching it. My overall rating is 5/10 and I would only recommend Blood C  to those of wantto kill some time and see a bunch action, monsters, and most importantly \"Blood.\" get it...",

Yup, a movie which features Newborn Porn and countless numbers of necrophilia is more fun to watch than Blood-C!\r\nCongratulations Production IG and CLAMP! You made A Serbian Film tolerable! By making the worst iteration of the Blood franchise exist, youguys pretty much made A Serbian Film more tolerable!\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, this is one of the worst anime of 2011. It's up there with Rio! Rainbow Gate and Oniikoto as thee worst anime iof 2011. But atleast Rio! had some decent fanservice to make up for it's shittiness. This? NOTHING!\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing in this series that can make up for how bad it is. Hell, not even Nana Mizuki tries her best to improve this pile of shit. Hell, whenever she talks about cube marshmallows and sing the same fucking song in every episode, you can just hear Nana Mizuki's inner thoughts saying:\\n\\n\r\n\"Seriously, i have to do 12 episodes of this shit. What the fuck am i doing here? I was expecting some xxxHolic and Geass, but i got this?!\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of CLAMP, they did a really shitty job at EVERYTHING in this series. The character designs are really awful, and it doesn't even stack up to their other character designs. And nanase Ohkawa wasn't even trying to make this series better. It's like she just copypasta'd the first half of episode 1 into the other 11 episodes. The writing of this series is so bad that you feel like you're watching a shittier remake of Endless Eight as written by Uwe Boll.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what sound? What music? There's nothing memorable about any of the music of this series. Nana Mizuki's morning song in each episode sucked, and the OP is just some shitty J-Rock filer music by some band i don't even give a shit about.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion: IT SUCKED. It made even the worst film in history look good. it made Mars of Destruction and Dragonaut look like Citizen Kane! I dropped this shit after episode 3 because i'd rather read all the other summaries of the other episodes on 4chan than watching this series. That shows how bad it is. Oh, and i want to cockpunch anyone who claims to like this series. If you even say that you like this series, then you're an asshole and you deserve to lose your genitals just like all the other male characters drawn by CLAMP.\\n\\n\r\nFuck this, i need to go for a drink.",

            "content": "Now that we are almost halfway into the show, I feel I can finally write an almost halfway decent review for this show. \r\nI will be brutally honest; because this show is not Blood+ or Blood the Last Vampire; Because Kai, Riku, Haji (Hagi), David, Diva, Solomon, the entire cast of the old Blood series who had captured our hearts and led us through an epic human drama are all missing. I was disappointed.\r\nProudly wearing my blood-colored spectacles, I admittedly was, from the first episode, biased against Saya Kisaragi. Her goodie-two-shoe personality, her \"Kyou wa ii tenki\" song, the pacing of her story, her oddschizophrenia, her friends, her family, everything about her world just didn't feel right. It didn't feel like Blood.\\n\\n\r\nBut then, as I continued inexplicably to watch this show every week as soon as it came out, realization struck me: Blood C is not a bad show. Hell, Blood C is a good show. Indeed, Blood C doesn't have the dark romance of a soul-bound chevalier. It does lack the harrowing depth of an eon old epic. And it's lead character does not possess the heartbreaking ephemeral delicate elegance of a schoolgirl neither human nor monster. But what Blood C has it has in great volume: entertainment value.\\n\\n\r\nFrom its OP to its ED, Blood C presents a solid music score does its job of setting up the background and atmosphere. Blood C's art style - done in the standard Clamp fashion - has both moments of devious beauty (Saya's smile at the end of the opening) and moments of sheer oddity (Saya's hair-puff, male characters). The animation from Production IG, however, is as always excellent and both complements and compensates for Clamp's art style (which is usually very hit-or-miss).\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of show content, however, the character and story develops slowly. The beginning episodes of the show, admittedly, present us with a rather bland plot and highly Clamp-cliched characters. But these characters, the story, and Saya's world develops and grows (albeit slowly) and, by episode 5, the tide of bloody darkness has already dyed with color the initially monochrome Saya and crew. \\n\\n\r\nThus while certainly not the best show this season (for me, that title is reserved for Usagi Drops), Blood C is nevertheless a solid anime. Saya may not be the most likeable or emotionally realistic character this season, I still find myself intrigued by story. I look forward to seeing what will come of this show next week.",

            "content": "As a person who've watched Blood+ before, I came in with some expectations for Blood-C. I was a little disappointed with how it was made. However, I am not going to be one of those people who will say that Blood-C was \"a giant troll of an anime\" or \"half assed\". Everyone is entitled to their own opinion of what they think of the anime and should not persuade others who are going to watch it, to stay away because they think that it was terrible.\r\nThe story follows a Shrine Maiden, Kisaragi Saya, as she lives a normal school life by down and hunts downand kills these \"Old ones\", who eats humans. In every episode, there is a guarantee that she kills at least one per episode... which is kind of repetitive. In my opinion, the story really starts to pick up towards the end, at around episode 10. In the first few episodes, I was putting Blood-C off, thinking that it was boring. As I progressed further into watching it, I was addicted to it and was intrigued by the end. I hope that the movie will turn out better than the series, and that it will finish.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent in this anime. Although, it was sloppy at times. There wasn't a whole lot of effort put into the art, as it wasn't that detailed. For example: a person is killed and when there is a different angle, you won't see that person that is killed anywhere on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty repetitive throughout the same series. Saya would always sing different songs about her daily encounters, but with the same tune. There wasn't a variety of background music that was used. \\n\\n\r\nFor characters, I would've liked to know some characters a little bit better, like Tokizane Shinichirou. Many of the characters were shrouded in mystery, viewers didn't get to know them. The characters were just... there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was pretty enjoyable. I was really captivated by it near the end. I just wished that the producers would've let it end in the series instead of making it into the movie. Well, since they are getting funded by the Japanese Government, the movie better be good... considering the money spent on this movie could've gone to a better cause.",

In order to forever scar their reputation, they decide to get their Blood the last vampire/Their own series they made cross over fanfiction animated, and the result?\r\nBlood C, one of the most hideous and disgusting things to have ever spawn from the inter hateful and disgusting minds of beloved manga creators, CLAMP.\r\nHateful? I'll get to that in a minute, but unarguably disgusting no doubt. Where over the top meets pure carnage where even the most torturedsoul from Hostile will be again thrown into a fit of pure agony.\\n\r\nAnd it's only insulting when all of this occurs after you have already gone through meaningless, pointless, time wasting and infuriating six to ten episodes of nothingness. All of that precious time gone, and what do you get in return? Well, you get enough unexplained plot points (Unexplained as in, the explanations are too farfetched to believe in) to reassure yourself that nothing made any sense in the end, an ending that only shown you that you HAVE to watch what comes next for the end of this garbage.\\n\r\nAnd a lot of the frustration, correction, possibly all of the frustration actually comes from the cast of bland throw aways (Literally) and an idiot who fails at level of what a \"hero\" is supposed to do, or for that matter, care about what she should do.\\n\\n\r\nSaya, a bubbly dimwit who loves to sing about what she ate for breakfast, is a high school student of school of essentially food for whatever random monster (Random is the best way to describe it, from giant samurai to raving rabbits on steroids, there is no rhyme or reason for their designs) comes to town fiending for a midnight snack, is quite simply, uninteresting, even at night where her \"father\" sends her to fight the creatures of the night. I'll admit, I found myself rewatching the first episode's beat down for how well animated and choreographed it was, despite some \"huh?\" moments (Her neck isn't broken? That monster's arm must have been made of lead.), to only be pleasantly disappointed by the next round of monster bashing (Monster train car and a tachikoma/Audrey 2 from little shop of horrors hate-off anyone?).\\n\r\nHold on a sec, I lost track of who I was talking about, Saya was it? Well, if I can go on to other things while I should be explaining her character, then my single word description might be dead on, when talking about her good traits... If she had any I guess.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters, meh, ehhhh, bland throw aways? If only that was the absolute case, but for this reviews sake, I'll only say you might as well slap troll faces on the entire cast, even the puppy dog that walks around is full of bullshit and giggles (You have to see it for yourself by how much bullshit it really is).\\n\r\nOh, there I go again, Saya is boring blah, blah, blah... But then there's her bad, no, just horrible traits. For CLAMP, I can only guess they were trying to throw something new into the bag of \"pin the trait on the hero\" party amusement, a trait where she only fails until the last second, but ultimately still failed. But that itself fails on every level, you surprised? You really shouldn't be, because who the hell can root for a failure who, no parentheses holding a snark comment, literally watches everything around torn to bloody desert dishes for the hungry hungry monsters, and literally yells \"I WILL RESCUE YOU!\" or something similar to that. Saya is a character that simply sits around and gets trolled throughout the entire series (In fact her life is simply the product of someone fucking around with her), and fails to protect friends and loved ones, which comes to another point, a one point she protect a classmate who comes out to her by admitting his affection for her, the next episode, he dies, dies a truly pathetic death one befitting a back ground character, and Saya practicably shrugs it off, no joke.\\n\\n\r\nIt's moments like those that made me wonder, characters, like named ones, are dying left and right, like how a nobody stock character would. Many could say there was something suspicious about it, but the reveal is simply a middle finger, mocking you, Saya, the fans of CLAMP and good twists in general. But I could forgive that, as long as there was something to get out of it, maybe the action scenes and battles? Okay episode one sure, but the ending spits on that possibility with nauseating gratuitous gore and blood flash floods, Itchy and Scratchy renditions of overblown proportions that disgust and impress, like an awe inspired crowd that somehow witnessed a septic tank set off like a nuclear explosion.\\n\r\nIt impressed me, that CLAMP would go this far, it's almost... fetishy in a way, like the anime is getting off from from the blood and guts being feverishly devoured, and the last episode enforces that, it's too sickening to think about it any further. I mean, where's the director in all this? Well, he allowed it, in all of CLAMP's bloody desire for violence on a disturbing level, and to the most fucked up way imaginable, especially how people are massacred endlessly in this anime (I will never look at a blender the same way ever again... Urgh, you really don't want to know what a blender has to do with anything in this anime). It'll really get you thinking, like does CLAMP really think in such horrible ways? How fucked up do you have to get to conceive the idea of making mass murders like this series lovably displays? I know of other series that me personally feel like my stomach dropped out of my body (Shigurai is pretty fucked up), but the cartoonish approach to the slaughter isn't just vomit inducing, it's insane with a capital Blerrrgh. %100 unnecessary and %100 flat out gross.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Blood C is ultimately a disgusting gigantic waste of time, I can only recommend to watch it to only to see just how vile it really is, and if you didn't see what was so disgusting about it, I'd probably recommend seeing a psychologist immediately, chances are you might be just as fucked up as CLAMP's bloody horrific mind set.",

The almost total lack of plot, plot development, character models, character development. Just about anything, it's basically just the elements of story line throwntogether into a mush with filler added. Even the dialogue and ways in which the characters express themselves is dull.\\n\\n\r\nBy episode three I wanted to stop watching, but after reading other reviews and wanting to always give all anime's a chance, I watched tell the end and I got through it. All I can really say is that this was honestly a horrible anime, with the only memorable parts being the gore, the average art, and the strings of storyline that made an awesome anime when they where in Blood+.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like the elements of story line present, and want to see them presented in a much better way I recommend checking out Blood+. Stay away from this train wreck unless you have time to kill and expectations to crush. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

Never have I seen so much bitterness and hatred against a show. Well, let me be the first to present the opposite of the mainstream opinions: I loved Blood C (gasp!) Before you turn away however, please let me explain.\r\nBlood C is literally a creative liberation from the two sister series in the Blood franchise; the only connection (so far) is that they all focus on a girl named Saya who wields a sword and fights monsters. Blood + had 50episodes, and thus had plenty of arcs and time to develop its very large cast- Blood C, on the other hand, at the most, has 12 episodes, and thus uses most of its time to build up atmosphere. Which it excels at, at the expense of fleshing out the secondary characters. Before you rain on my parade, there are a few things to note; Blood C is part of the Blood franchise, which includes the movie Blood; The Last Vampire, and Blood +, the sequel anime show. Please, please stick this in your head now: Blood C has absolutely nothing to do with these two installments. It is a mere sister series with the shadow of the concept. Thus treat this as an entirely new show.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I will put it out forward: Blood C is either a show you are going to loathe or that you are going to love. Most people hated it, some people liked it. I loved it. It is not for people who are looking for interesting fabulous fleshed out characters (this is coming from someone who is the biggest sucker for character development). This is a show that focuses on atmosphere and building it. It is a horror series. It is not an action series, though the action scenes in this show are some of the most creative, well animated ones I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nIt is literally horror at its best- I assure you that if you're a sucker for the type of horror which is more psychological than just pop-outs, this show is for you. If you hate slow build ups, move on. The first half of Blood C focuses on instilling the surreal setting and life of the show into your head. I won\u2019t deny it; the first four episodes or so are pretty dull because they are monotonous; Saya sings a song to school, chatters with her buddies, and fights a monster. What you don\u2019t realize is that this is all- and I mean all of it, pay attention to all the details- for a very good reason, which comes later. This is the part where I admit that there are some flaws; this could have been easily condensed into three episodes max. It still does a good job of developing a very eerie aura though; you have the constant feeling that something is very wrong about this town, and yet you can\u2019t place your finger on it. There's an eerie tension consistently kept despite the seemingly innocuous events; a tension that's about to snap and yet you don't know when or how. \\n\\n\r\nSo whereas the first half spends its time just fleshing the atmosphere and setting of the world Saya lives in, and the latter half spends the next half tearing that world down.  Allow me to present you the latter half of Blood C, which absolutely shines like no other. Halfway throughout this show, you are literally smacked in the face. Repeatedly. In each episode. This is the real deal- you are given cruel reality of the situation; and goddamn, it is cruel. It is merciless. I am not just talking about the gore, which mind you, is on par of that of Narutaru, which has some of the most disturbing scenes I have seen yet. The gore is of course, censored (not the show\u2019s fault, the network\u2019s fault, something which will be fixed when the DVDs come out and dear lord then you can let your stomach churn), but that\u2019s not what makes it horrifying; it\u2019s the way the gore happens, the way no one is spared in this show, the sounds which are so gruesomely realistic. This is not a show for the faint of heart. But the gore is only the sprinkles on the actual cake. The cake is the series of red herrings and plot twists that wrench your heart. You will witness in horror, how everything in front of you, how every trope known to anime kind, is smashed and ripped apart. If anything, Blood C excels at building atmosphere and horror. The fight scenes are as fabulous as they are gruesome.  But yes. Blood C's purpose and key to the show is how it builds up the plot layer by layer, paranoia by paranoia. The villains are completely ruthless, and there is no battle fought without someone dying.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are where things get messy. There\u2019 s two very good reasons why none of the cast except Saya is fleshed out. Nevertheless, they are pretty stereotypical, and are very CLAMPish. But once again; you don\u2019t really end up bothering about them for good reasons. Saya herself is very likeable; you come to empathize with her situation if anything and while you might get irritated with her\u2026.inepititude, at times, you have to understand what she\u2019s going through. In the end, this show is about her for reasons you have yet to find out, so don\u2019t be quick to judge!\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the last, and most important aspect of an anime; how it ends. I have two huge problems with anime, as someone who has seen more than enough for a lifetime.\\n\\n\r\n1.) The ending is rushed. You have no idea how frustrating this is. This is not a tv drama in which a season\u2019s ending can be bad and can pick itself off the ground later on. This is a conclusion and nothing is more irritating and annoying than loving a show only to see the worst plot holes and resolution possible.\\n\\n\r\n2.) Animes that build up to a movie, or huge series, tend to be terrible. Let\u2019s look at two prime examples; .hack//ROOTS was the buildup to the game series, .hack//G.U Trilogy, and it just failed as an individual series because it only left us with very little to deal with and just a fancy commercial to buy the games. Higashi no Eden had wonderful, wonderful potential but got axed by the fact that it was nothing but a mere leg for the two movies to follow. As individual series, these tend to absolutely collapse.\\n\\n\r\nBlood C completely surpasses these two typical faults and succeeds. It paces itself extremely, extremely well; the finale was fantastic and does not leave any open ties that cannot be answered by a movie sequel. The buildup to the finale itself is wonderful, for the most part; while the first part lags a little, it\u2019s not a huge problem and hell, once you\u2019re in, you are stuck in for the biggest ride. Not only does it separate itself as an individual show, and actually solve most of the problems raised in the show and leave a resolution (or many) for it to be complete on its own, but it manages to still raise questions and leave some unanswered so that it can tie itself over with the movie. You are left with a feeling of excitement and resolution; you want to go back and rewatch the series again, but at the same time you\u2019re excited that some big questions are going to be answered in the movie installment.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's even greater is the subtlety- you can go back through this series and catch on the really tiny moments and dialogue that what were once usually tasteless random things, are now essential \u2018oh!\u2019 moments where you realize there\u2019s two (or more) things being said. I\u2019m a huge fan of subtlety and I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m such a passionate fan of this show, and I\u2019m really glad they\u2019re doing stuff like this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBasically, Blood C was fabulous for me. It had the layered buildup of Shiki, the horror of Ghost Hound and themes of Jigoku Shoujo, and gore of Shadow Star. If you like horror, and well paced ones, then totally go for this. It\u2019s not for everyone though, and it\u2019s definitely not for the faint of heart. It takes huge, huge risks, risks that most series would not go for, but it manages to complete the leap and land with a very solid and steady landing.  I personally, I believe Blood C is a remarkable show that pushes the boundaries of the Blood franchise and creates horror by clashing it with the mundane, ordinary life- only making it more frightening than ever.\\n",

            "content": "Blood-C is a lot of things, but above all, it's a very painful series to watch. Is it painful to watch because of how interesting and moving the characters are? I wish I could say that but no, it's painful because I could only take five episodes of this garbage before considering whether or not to outright drop it. \r\nAs a long time fan of the Blood series, I expected a lot more from this show and if I had not been a fan beforehand, I'd likely have dropped this instead of seeing it all the way through. Now don't get me wrong, there's valuein watching this show, but don't expect to actually enjoy it as much as you'll enjoy using it as an example of how 'not' to make a new addition to the Blood franchise. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, at first, the show appears as if it has an interesting premise, using much of the first episode to build up for a potential climax, in which we see our slow protagonist suddenly drawing a blade and butchering some evil dohicky that's likely going to be our show's antagonist. It was built up step by step to reach the climax of the episode, where our bland and boring, yet rather cute protagonist goes through a series of sequences - That she repeats in every single freaking episode for more than five minutes with little to no changes between each one. \\n\\n\r\nNearly -all- of the episodes are the damned same, and not even in a good way that makes you want to continue watching, they're just literally presented in the same manner. I'm not even talking about a Haruhi repetition, this was outright just rehashing the same plot for every episode without changing -anything-, while briefly introducing us to other boring and uninteresting characters, but hey, that's fine. It's in a modern setting, the characters aren't supposed to be especially interesting. - EXCEPT MAYBE OUR PROTAGONIST, who has about as much personality as a walking, singing doll. \\n\\n\r\nMoving along, the action scenes at the end of nearly every single episode are worth watching but not worth the amount of time you have to wait to actually get to them. There's nothing to feel about the monsters she's killing, they're just the generic bad guys that she's been given the duty of slaying by her weirdo father who barely ever speaks to her. The name of the series is Blood,  and they do a good job in nailing that in, OVER AND OVER with gigantic blood baths in every single episode. Now, I liked this at first. If the series has no interesting characters and no change in plot every single episode, I might as well enjoy the gore, right? Wrong! In the versions I watched at least, they began censoring all of the gore about half-way through the damned series. When the Japanese start censoring gore, something just doesn't feel right.I assume the DvD release had an uncensored version but even so, I'm not fortunate enough to be able to afford such a thing and to be honest, I'd never want anyone to spend money on this garbage. \\n\\n\r\nThis series could have been so much better. I like Studio Clamp, I like the Blood Franchise. Clearly, this show is a good example of why you shouldn't try to mix the two together. \\n\\n\r\nOn a more positive note, I like the art. It's nothing spectacular or out of this world. If you enjoy works by Studio Clamp, you'll definitely enjoy the styling of the characters, with those big heads and elongated limbs! No, honestly. They look cute, it's a pity they couldn't have given them personalities at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nIt's filled with blood, blood everywhere, which is fine but at the times I wish they would have taken a more subtle approach in some of the episodes. It might be called Blood but we can see that from the title, you don't have to go all out on us in every episode. The Blood Franchise is more than just a cheesy horror story, just look at Blood+ for an example. \\n\\n\r\nThe monsters look ridiculous, stupid and not a single one of them shares anything in common with the others. I think this would have helped the series a lot if this matter had received just a little more attention. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, if you don't buy the DvD release, you're stuck with the most horrible form of censorship imaginable after the first few episodes. Massive white bars that obscure most of the screen. What kind of garbage is this, Japan? Seriously. Don't censor your anim\u00e9. That's one of the most appealing things about it. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't think much about the sound-track on a personal note but it does fit what's happening in the series, the background music is well chosen and helps to build up the atmosphere. I didn't really think much of the opening and ending songs, they were substandard and completely boring to watch or listen to, likely because the show itself has that effect on people. \\n\\n\r\nI can't say I enjoyed this series and that's rare for me. It does pick up during the last few episodes, more or less the last two, where the plot changes drastically and we have a few nice twists, but I'd say they were executed much too late into the damned series. In a series like this, you can't just throw it all out at the last episode because nobodies going to want to watch it for that long. I also enjoyed a small cameo appearance of another one of my favorite Studio Clamp characters, but you'll have to figure out that one for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly. Just watch it if you have the time, and make a list of why it's a horrendous piece of magnificent stupidity. You'll have fun just doing that. It's always a good conversation topic for the forums too.",

            "content": "WARNING: THIS MIGHT CONTAIN SLIGHT SPOILERS THOUGH I WILL ATTEMPT TO KEEP THEM TO A MINIMUM!!!\r\nAlso, I the first paragraph under each section was based on 3/12 episodes seen.  The second paragraph will be an update based on having seen the series in it's entirety.  I'm just too lazy to actually write something brand new lol.  Anyways, On to the review...\r\nStory: 3\r\nThe story has been weak for me and falls far short of expectations.  I was expecting something dark and similar to Blood+ in many ways but perhaps with a fresh twist, however, what I have seen thus far is basicallya high school slice-of-life drama with about 5 minutes at the end of every episode that give a slight nod to this series' predecessor, Blood+.  I understand this a new series with an alternate take on the story but this pales in comparison to the previous version.  There has been little progression in the story other than through character development (the little that there has been anyways) and there hasn't been an explanation offered for these \"monsters\" that Saya keeps fighting despite already having seen 1/4 of the season.  The story just isn't entertaining and is convoluted and obscure.\\n\\n\r\nThis hold true for about half of the season.  Then after episode 5 the series begins to become a little bit more action oriented but offers even less character development and zero plot progression as a result.  Then an entire seasons worth of plot, build-up and all, is dumped on the viewer in the final two episodes with the last being a gore-fest.  I understand what the story was aiming for and I even understand the approach that as attempted, but I felt the story was just crammed into two episodes at the end thus it rushed to me and failed on it's delivery.  SPOILER: Also,if this matters to you at all, even knowing there is going to be a movie next year, the series ends with information but no resolution.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nAs far as the art design goes it's not bad and on par with other anime.  The animation itself is nothing spectacular with the exception of Saya's fight scenes.  Though a little too dark at times, the animation instantly improves and I will say that I am happy to see fluid sword movements in some scenes without excessive repetition.  Other than that, however, it is basic.  Not bad but not great.  The character designs are ok, though I must admit I am not that much of a fan of Saya.  The hair is just ridiculous for someone who has the responsibilities that she does.  Again, the previous Saya from Blood+ was far superior in this respect again.  Also, for supposedly being a high schooler, Yuuka Amino sure has the design of someone who just stepped out of the russian mafia.  I feel like she is drawn far older than her character is intended to be.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series finished, I pretty much retained the feelings I had after episode three.  Bad character designs and great actions scenes.  Actually the latter became even better.  Especially in the last episode when Saya fights \"Thundercat\".  You'll knw who this is when it happens.  And the ensuing fight scene is probably one of the best I've seen in an anime in a very very long time.  The action is fast, almost \"what just happened\" fast, yet still clear.  The sword movements are swift and non-repetitive.  Overall, the action is the saving grace of this series from an artistic point and I can only hope the action style is incorporated into other anime in the future.\\n\\n\r\nSound:6\\n\r\nI am not an audiophile so for me I look for basic clarity and voices.  I can hear things clearly, so it passes my clarity test lol.  As far as the voice choices, I haven't adored any of them other than Misato Fukuen.  The voice actors are alright and don't take away from the story.\\n\\n\r\nThis held true throughout the series.  An average score for average voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nHere is the big one for me.  What. The. Hell. Is. Wrong. With. Saya.  She is beyond lacking common sense.  She is beyond ditzy even.  She is a whole new level of clueless that is shocking to even have to witness.  She has ZERO awareness as to what's going on around her unless it has to do with that dog, Tokizane, her father, or fighting.  It's painful to see a main protagonist be so absentminded she doesn't even realize that her friends, who are but five feet away from her, talk about her to her face, and then snap into battle mode in the remaining few minutes.  Also, I think that her adoration for her father is kind of odd.  It's a little too much daddy's girl for me.  Not that the show ever hints that the relationship is odd, which I think makes it even more odd since it was probably unintended.  The other characters fall flat and seem bland.  The saving grace to this show are the twins.  They are cute and funny.\\n\\n\r\nThis is about the most interesting part of the series since so much happens in the last two episodes to either change perceptions or reaffirm suspicions.  Saya remains beyond ditzy and clueless till the last episode and everything else would spoil surprises so I will simply say that character development is still extremely slow and uninteresting.  It's hard to relate to characters and care about them when their personalities are so generic and underdeveloped.  However, the last two episodes change this.  For better or for worse is up to you.  For me,it made it interesting.  Most will probably just rage.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nAt least the fight scenes are entertaining, despite the fact I have no clue what she is fighting or why.  Still, as stated above, this is where the animation picks up a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThis hold true thought an explanation is given at some point.  The animation still remains the biggest plus for this series.  The fight scenes are good, even if they are a little sparse in the beginning.  I actually kind of like the \"twist\" at the end.  The deliver was a complete failure and thus this series will be rated very low on average but I like the attempt.  Again I understand the why, but it doesn't change the fact it failed.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nExplained above.",

(Sorry, the annoying, pathetic naive main character NEVER gets cooler. At all.

It can get pretty disturbing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this series sucks. Unless you are just in the mood to watch a bunch of ordinary innocent people die in disgustingly brutal ways, you probably won't enjoy it. At all.",

            "content": "Sexy action heroine. Check. School life setting. Check. Gratuitous violence. Check. Monster of the week format. Check.\r\nSo what went wrong here? \r\nWell first of all, there is a serious lack of plot progression in the first few episodes which IMO should be the most important of the story. The first few episodes are the \"hook\" that will make the audience decide whether they will watch the next episode or drop this show. The director and the writer failed at this part. Yes they made a decent 1st episode but the succeeding ones are almost carbon copy of the 1st one with minor variations. Example: Sayaeats her breakfast, goes to school, talks with friends, a random but vague hint/foreshadowing appears and then time to kill the monster of the day. The show basically wasted 3-4 episodes before getting to the interesting part of the story.\\n\\n\r\nSecond. The story's pacing. The director and the writer purposely extended a rather simple story by dragging or adding scenes that doesn't necessarily contribute to the plot. Blood-C's story(including the upcoming movie) can fit in a 12 episode format with proper direction and storytelling. There is no doubt about it. \\n\\n\r\nThird. Incohesive story. Blood-C is a mystery story. The plot revolves around the \"truth\" about Saya, the monsters and the town. In order for a mystery story to work the writer must occasionally drop hints at the right time that will create interest or excitement to the story and at the same time reveal a part of the plot a little bit. The show failed at creating interest by hammering the audience with repetitious vague hints/flash backs. How many times have you heard of \"the contract\" or \"the promise that Saya made\"? Did it enlighten you a little bit when you heard those phrase or did it leave you clueless and confused? Only in the last few episodes have we learned about the truth. Was it satisfying? Maybe. Are there any audience left that will watch the \"explanatory\" episode? You know the answer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the action and maybe the fanservice but the story just bored me to death. So in conclusion, Blood-C is one of those anime that could have been something unique and interesting but end up bad.",

            "content": "Blood-C is another installment to the famed Blood anime franchise. Re-envisioned by the prolific mangaka group CLAMP and animated by equally as respected studio Production I.G. Sounds like a recipe for success, right? Well, unfortunately it didn't turn out that way. Blood-C is unbearably slow, gratingly cryptic, and the epitome of mediocre writing. A real shame, because it certainly had potential to be good.\r\nFirst off, it's worth pointing out even though it is attached to an existing franchise, Blood-C doesn't connect to Blood: The Last Vampire or Blood+, besides the basic premise; as such it should be judged on its own merits rather than comparedto the other two works. That said, Blood-C fails all on its own.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, Blood-C does have the makings of a good story. As with its predecessors, the story follows a sword-wielding girl named Saya, who hunts man-eating monsters. The big difference here is that this version of Saya is a bespectacled air-head (at least by first appearances) who lives in a small town and leads a normal life by day. Of course she is living a double-life, and by night she defends the town from the inhuman Elder Brains... or at least that what she thinks she's doing, because it becomes increasingly clearer (to the viewer) that things in Saya's quiet little town are not quite as they seem. Throughout the show Saya's life begins to unravel; the actions of those around her become increasingly suspicious to the viewer. At the same time, it is implied by an mysterious narrator that Saya is involved in some kind of twisted game. Mix this cryptic intrigue with the show's graphic violence, and you have what should have been a been an effective horror story.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what goes wrong? Well, for one, the pacing is very bad. Yes, the show is supposed to be cryptic and mysterious, but even then it feels like it is just dragging on forever. Shows like Monster, Higurashi, Boogiepop Phantom are good examples of how deliberate pacing can keep the viewership on edge; Blood-C is not. The problem is, unlike the other examples I just gave, Blood-C has very little character or plot development until the last three episodes. This means most of its run time is spent on gristly battles (which are admittedly quite good), boring school-life scenes, and waving the mystery in the viewer's face while explaining nothing. Watching Saya have strange visions and collapse is captivating the first time around, but after the same thing happens four or more episodes in a row without even an inkling as to what any of this even means, it loses its edge. The story takes so long to reveal anything that by the time it does (in long tiresome exposition) the viewer simply doesn't care more.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems with pacing could have been remedied by a good cast of characters, unfortunately, Blood-C has a distinct lack of that as well. In fact, the characters are likely the worse things about this show. Saya isn't a particularly interesting lead despite the mystery that surrounds her, because she lacks personality; really, she just doesn't stand out as far as female leads. Cafe manager Fumito, and to a lesser degree Saya's teacher Ms. Tsutsutori, are the closest any character gets to being genuinely interesting because they seem to be the ones who know the most through a majority of the show. The rest of the characters are one-dimensional dead ends, each defined by a single character trait (that's right, not even a set of character traits) such as the class rep having a crush on Saya, or Tokizane being a brooding loner; this is the laziest characterization imaginable. These characters are so weak that once the initial shock of seeing central characters getting killed off subsides, their deaths have little to no impact at all. Of course, the plot twist in episode 11 might inadvertently explain why the characterizations were so weak to that point, though this is probably more of an excuse than valid justification. However, even then the characters come off as one-dimensional with the shallowest of motivations.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one thing that is high quality in Blood-C, its technical merits. CLAMP is well known for their unique visual style and Production I.G. for the high production value of its shows; Blood-C clearly benefits from the marriage of these two juggernauts of the anime world. Character designs are eye candy; Saya and her friends, heck all the characters in fact, are more attractive than most can ever hope to be. The monstrous Elder Brains are bizarrely eye-catching as well, each wonderfully imaginative in their distinctive (and often gruesome) appearances. Supporting the character designs is fluid animation courtesy of Production I.G., along with strong backgrounds, and very graphic violence and gore (as I can assume by the heavy censorship). The music is quality stuff; perfect for embodying the mysticism, mystery, and menace that envelops the show. Really, it is a shame the writing is not on par with the visuals and music; the show would have been good if it was.\\n\\n\r\nBlood-C really feels like potential wasted. It has what could have been the making of a great show; not to mention quality art and music. However, the sluggish pacing and the dirt poor characters ruin any chance the show had of being good. I can only hope that the movie sequel will fair better; at the very least Blood-C might be a marketing success... because regardless of how you feel about the show as a whole, the final episode will probably leave you wanting to watch the movie.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Blood-C is a badly executed anime with a good concept and a good story. There's no real developpement until the last episodes and that's why it's hard to appreciate. I think I liked it more because I watched it all in one go, it's a lot less painful that way. My other advice would be to watch the unscencored DVD and BD version because the gore is one of the most extreme in recent anime.\r\nStory 6/10 (8/10 with the ending)\r\nThe story is almost non-existent until the last episodes, it's mostly atmosphere and events without clear context. It pays off in the end, because those \"useless\"episodes have a purpose in the long run. The ending is the best part of the show and left me wanting more. I certainly cannot wait for the movie sequel to come out!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4.5/10)\\n\r\nNo real character developpement. It's only in the last episode that we see glimpse of interesting characters, but we're gonna wait for the movie to see more of them.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound (8.5/10)\\n\r\nThe art is from CLAMP and production IG kept it good till the end. The combat were brutal and incredibly bloody when it wasn't censored. The music is the best part. The soundtrack really gave emotions to scene that would have been bland.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion 7/10\\n\r\nAll in all, it's a good story backed up by beautiful art and music. The pacing issues are really troublesome in the first 5 episodes. I highly recommend watching it in one go for a better enjoyment! This season felt like a 12 episodes trailer for an awesome movie. Count me hooked for Blood-C: The Last Dark.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime is only just 2 episodes away from its finale, so my ratings are as follows:\r\nStory- Fair 6\r\nAccording to other MAL users who made the same review as I was doing, this 12 episode anime is part of CLAMP\u2019s \u201cBlood +\u201d franchise, Oh by the way, I have not watched any anime nor have I read any manga related to \u2018Blood +\u201d, except this one (manga not included). So, the story just follows the usual arc were a hero is out to hunt down monsters terrorizing the community, but in this case it is a heroine by the name of Saya Kisaragi a mikoat Ukishima shrine located on a small picturesque prefecture somewhere in Japan, who, every night would go out to hunt down the Elder Bairns or Furukimonos who are terrorizing the neighborhood (at first). However the story has a strong mystery genre like: why are the Elder Bairns out to either feast or kill people living around the village, who is Saya\u2019s really is and what and to whom did she made a promise to, and who is the main villain in this anime. These are the questions which makes this anime to have a \u201cFair\u201d rating.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt- Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nThe art together with the characters has some resemblance with Code Geass franchise and 07-Ghost, you know, where everyone looks tall and skinny, btw, I really hate Saya\u2019s pigtails.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nI just have nothing to say in this part, except that I like the opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters roles in this anime were simply mend to  either be meat in the grinder or part of the mystery as having something to do with the Elder Bairns or Furukimonos, so who are they, I\u2019m dividing them in 3 categories:\\n\\n\\n\r\nHeroine:\\n\\n\r\nSaya Kisaragi \u2013  behind her sweetness and clumsiness is a student by day and a hunter by night, she uses her mother\u2019s sacred blade to fight off the Furukimono\u2019s who are out  preying on humans, she under the guidance of her father Tadayoshi who happens to be the shrine priest. As the anime goes, she get even more busy dealing with the Furukimono\u2019s who started to go out even in broad daylight and on a rampage so much so that her friends and classmates become live prey for them Furukimonos. She is a mystery as to who she really is, and why does she have the ability to heal quickly after a battle with a Furukimono aside from having the capacity to fight. She is fond of the talking dog whom she encounters every now and then, though she consults with the dog, she has no clue as to what it is talking about, because the dog itself talks in a cryptic manner. She\u2019s friend with Nene, Nono, Yuka, Itsuki and Shin\u2019ichir\u014d, she\u2019s a regular at Guimauve caf\u00e9 where the owner is her father\u2019s junior way back from their high school days.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMeats in the grinder or Saya\u2019s friends\\n\\n\r\nNene and Nono Moete \u2013 twins who talk at the same time, cheerful, witty and they\u2019re dead in episode 6, one becomes a Furukimono\u2019s appetizer, while the other becomes another Furukimono\u2019s lunch. They reappeared in episode 10, but it is yet to know if they\u2019re spirits,Furukimonos or illusions made by Saya\u2019s homeroom teacher Kanako Tsutsutori.  \\n\\n\r\nYuka Amino- a tall athletic beauty, part of Saya\u2019s friends, died protecting her other classmates from being part of a Furukimono\u2019s menu in episode 9. She wasn\u2019t eaten, but she was skewed to death.\\n\\n\r\nItsuki Tomofusa- also Saya\u2019s friend who the class rep in Saya\u2019s class and he\u2019s the only one who got away from being part the Furukimono\u2019s diet in episode 9.\\n\\n\r\nShin'ichir\u014d Tokizane- he\u2019s Saya\u2019s supposed lover, but in episode 10 he becomes another  Furukimono\u2019s dinner instead , at first I suspect that he has something to do with the death of his classmates from his class in episode 9.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSuspects:\\n\\n\r\nTadayoshi Kisaragi \u2013 though he\u2019s Saya\u2019s daddy and sword trainer, he does little to help his daughter to fend off the Furukimonos and when his daughter feels sad after witnessing the deaths of her classmates he does little seem to comfort her and if he does he seems to pretend to sympathized with her, in fact he hides a lot of secrets from her. In MAL\u2019s forum one commentator (It didn\u2019t came from me) suggested that Saya\u2019s father may not be whom Saya thinks he is and may in even be the  main antagonist himself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFumito Nanahara \u2013 owner of Guimauve caf\u00e9 where Saya and her father are regulars since they\u2019re both at bad at cooking, his closeness and shows of affections to Saya is very suspicious that one can\u2019t help but to think that he could either be the main or the her secondary antagonist of this anime, In MAL\u2019s forum there is another commentator (that too didn\u2019t came from me) who suggested that the Guimauve marshmallow that he\u2019s giving to Saya contains blood from the Furukimono which she had killed and even suggested that both him and the latter\u2019s father are accomplices.\\n\\n\r\nKanako Tsutsutori \u2013 Saya\u2019s homeroom teacher, what makes her also suspicious is her sense of timing co\u2019z she seem to be in the right place in the right time,  in one episode she was in school when Saya arrive alone to find out that classes are suspended  and started to also question  about the promise to someone whom she (Saya) has no idea of and in episode 9 she arrived and met with Saya a few minutes after the latter had killed the Furukimono who massacre her class, she doesn\u2019t show any signs of shock which one would normally experience when they either saw or heard something appalling in fact she even acted as if nothing happen as if the student killed are just some livestock's whom are ready for the slaughter. What plans does she have for Saya after showing her something which would change her life; we have yet to know in the up coming episode 11. \\n\\n\\n\r\nItsuki Tomofusa \u2013 ok, maybe he is or maybe he\u2019s not an Elder Bairns, but, he having escape from being part of a Furukimono\u2019s diet is suspicious enough.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDog- what about him? We still have yet to know.  All was known is that this talking magical dog was part of another anime \u201cxxxHolic.\u201d Or at least, according to some MAL user from the forum, besides I haven\u2019t seen that anime yet. He is the only one were Saya can find comfort, but he may or may not have anything to do as to what is happening in the town where a lot of bad things are happening.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall good 7.\\n\\n\r\nOk, so this anime\u2019s genres are the following: Action, horror, mystery, drama, vampire, slice of life and supernatural. Here\u2019s the thing of all the mentioned genres only action, horror, and supernatural were the most prominent in this anime, the rest are just trivial, as for the vampire genre, I don\u2019t think that Furukimono\u2019s eating humans whole would qualify as one. But you know the real stars of this anime is the raw violence that comes with the horror genre and the mystery that surrounds the characters that arouses one\u2019s curiosity  as to find out more about the strange things that happens in a small town where our heroine lives, overall it is something to be enjoyed with curiosity .\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The honest truth is, at this point I have not had much exposure to the series that Blood-C is supposed to be a remake of. I wanted to watch it because I heard good things about the series and its storyline, but had problems getting past the first episode. So, when I heard about Blood-C, I found myself excited because I was hoping the storyline would be a remake that was simply dulled down a bit violence wise. However, my excitement diminished greatly once I got into the series.\r\nMy personal opinion is, Blood-C felt way to much like an amature fanfic. The specific kind Iam thinking of, is where the fanfic writer takes the original material and decides to create an amazing AU (alternate universe). However, when you start reading this fanfic, you can't recognize the characters or world at all, because it is in truth not fanfiction, but original work disguised as fanfiction.\\n\\n\r\nThis type of fanfic is actually frowned upon in the fanfiction community. This is even true when the writing is considered good, because the readers are seriously left wondering why original work wasn't created in the first place. Of course, there are some people who gush praise over the work because it comes across as original and refreshing, but they forget that the work is supposed to be derivative, not stand alone.\\n\\n\r\nThis is exactly what has happened with this Anime. I honestly feel that CLAMP should have simply created their own vampire novel, rather then placing Saya's name on some random character. That, and the fact that the military is involved is the only thing that really stays the same. But that honestly isn't the only problem I have with the plot of the Anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that has bothered me about CLAMPS work, is the fact that much of there work has some sort of tie in with something else they have done. Blood-C is not spared from this, as the character Kimihiro from xxxHolic makes an appearance. Thankfully, the crossover actually works and proves to be important to the storyline. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, because I am not sure if I want CLAMP touching other Anime again, unless they are upfront that they are doing a crossover. Which is another element that makes Blood-C feel like a badly written fanfic, truth be told. Some fanfic crossovers manage to only do one fandom justice and it feels like it was xxxHolic here... and that wasn't supposed to be the fandom they were focusing on.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of xxxHolic, Blood-C is also done in the same style. I remember some people wondering about this when the series first started. There was a few variations, almost like CLAMP tried to meld the two styles, but it honestly didn't work that well. Some shots felt wrong in the animation, like in the beginning few episodes, Saya seemed way to long in limb.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of this, there was censorship of the blood and gore scenes. I might have been fine with this, if it hadn't been for the fact that flashes of light to cut down on the violence is hands down considered poor technique when you are choosing to cut back. There are other ways to do this, ways that would come across better.\\n\\n\r\nOther artistic aspect lay in the music. To be honest, I liked the opening theme very much, but the truth is, it didn't match up with the rest of the series. For example, we had Saya's horrible singing to contend with. Well, it wasn't that bad, but the soundtrack to the actual Anime didn't seem to match up with the quality of the opening, which did not help in this series being a major let down.\\n\\n\r\nAlso was a major let down were the actual characters. There was no major character development until the last two episodes. The characters were one dimensional and not really ones that you could become attached too. Some people will argue that the turn of the events in the last two episodes should explain all of this, but I honestly think that they could have cut a lot of filler and had a much longer storyline.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I did enjoy watching the Anime. This is another one though, that I didn't enjoy it for the reasons the creators wanted me too, unless they really were trying to make the worst remake ever in Anime History. I kept shaking my head, wondering how CLAMP could have been serious at this, or how this wasn't a true remake. Reminds me of the Mario Brothers live action movie kind of, now that I think of it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I am highly disappointed.",

            "content": "Ok, so my opinion of blood-C is that it is an amazing anime. Right now I'm noticing alot of bad reviews and ratings but I feel that it's only because the series is only on it's 4th episode. The anime hasn't had the chance to really speed up into that super crazy awesomeness most anime's hit. But I've actually been enjoying it very much. Maybe it's due to the fact that I've only seen some of blood+, but hey doesn't that just been i'm not biased into saying blood-C sucks because blood+ is sooooo much better. Come on, you've got to have an open mindand take blood-C in completely! So far in blood-C we know that Saya Kisaragi is a seemingly nice and kind girl by day, freaking awesome monster killer by night. \\n\\n\r\nHow is that not awesome? I mean the girl sings walking to school in the morning, picks up garbage, eats at the cafe near her house, tries to help stray animals and is nice to everybody. Yet come night time, she kills these horrible crazy monsters risking her life for her town under her fathers orders and hurt or not always returns covered in a whole lot of blood and ready to go to school and repeat that whole process of the day. THIS IS SO COOL!!! \\n\\n\r\nNow I know the main character has yet to prove her total awesomeness, but I feel that her purity is starting to crack. Normally she's able to kill these monsters and able to return to the normal nice girl during the day like nothing happened. BUT. Now that these monsters known as \"the old ones\" have been spouting nonsense about \"the covenant\" Saya seems to becoming more physically and emotionally strained. Not to mention confused about whatever this covenant is. As well I noticed how she's getting more hurt every time she fights these monsters. I bet you anything that within the next few episodes Saya's true character is going to take off and pull this anime -not with her- but ahead of her! Hey maybe we'll learn more about that beautiful and mysterious guy in her class? Hmm? I HOPE SO!! \\n\\n\r\nTherefore I gave the story an 8, because I like the mysterious and slow feel to it so far, and I just know that this is only the calm before the storm. The story is truley going to pick up very soon, and hey this is only the beginning. Didn't blood+ have like 50 episodes or something?\\n\\n\r\n For art i gave it a 10, because I feel that the art is beautiful. Saya's character is so unique and beautiful, as well many characters in this anime are. My fav other than Saya is the mysterious guy from her class Shinichirou Tokizane, he's just so cool looking. The scenery in this anime like the shrine, the cafe, the town and her fights. I love her fight scenes they're so well drawn out.\\n\\n\r\n Sound I gave it a 7, because it just doesn't seem all that significant to me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter I gave it a 10 because of how much I love Saya, I can't wait to see what happens to her in the next episode! I mean come on! She fights monsters EVERY night! As well I love the humour of the other characters and the mysteriousness of some of them.\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment I gave it a 10 because i  really like this anime. The action scenes are killer and no matter what I can't help smiling at Saya's cute and Corky character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave it a 9. Just wait, when this anime really kicks off everyone will feel the same as me =)",

WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!\r\ni really wish i hadn't stuck with it in the hope it would get better. my boyfriend couldn't get past ep.3 but nooo i had to fucking continue... i hope i can save those of you who are here for the violence/gore, dark mystery or love good storytelling and well developed characters in general. you will mostly be watching plainly boring fluff/walking around/seeing the main character tackle daily routine. and then 2-4 min of gore are somehow squeezed in there to keep you from dropping the anime (there is one fight per episode, usuallyin the end). you will be so angry because it is just not enough to make up for all your wasted lifetime.\\n\\n\r\nif you are still curious about the gore, here is my advice:\\n\r\n1) watch ep. 1. make yourself an impression of what's to be expected of the \"storytelling\". congratulations you now know the main character and general setup, there isn't much more to know really :D also you might now understand this review. \\n\r\n2) SKIP through the rest of the episodes until you come across some monster/blood\\n\r\n3) watch ep. 11 and 12 to find out what the actual fuck was going on. also enjoy the grande finale as seen on youtube etc :)\\n\\n\r\nit will be like you've seen it all, promised.\\n\r\nyou will not miss cool badass characters (i fell for it damnit). sayas friends are generic, overly nice and have no backstory. even saya herself has the emotions and IQ of a five year old. she often just stands around while the monsters are happily devouring people. after randomly attacking the monster without any special tactics she complains that basically everybody died. it is painful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nand there is like no important story revealed whatsoever until episode 11... saya never questions anything happening to her until maybe late 10th episode. cryptic backflashes fail to do anything for the plot or the suspense, they are only adding up to the slow pace. and who is dying is completely irrelevant, you had no connection to any character in the first place. it is just soooo boring! \\n\\n\r\nand it's not even that i don't like fluff. i just cannot stand when an anime is shallow and consists of 80+% filler trash. maybe if it's really funny i can make exceptions ^^ but we literally see the main character waking up, doing household chores, singing a song about how nice the weather is, getting breakfast at her favourite cafe, talking with the owner about how good the coffee is and that she is feeling fine, on her way to school she's now singing some more, with her friends she's pretending to be okay again, bragging about the great food at her favourite cafe... oh time to go home again - of course singing how nice her day was (at the point of the second song you want to shoot yourself), then she sits in the cafe again, having dinner, chatting about the texture of some sweets she eats... \\n\\n\r\ni am not fucking kidding!!! it is this or gore, nothing in between!\\n\r\n\"wait, seriously?! what about later episodes when she already turned into killer queen?\" sorry, these are some main activities during the whole thing. yay! saya is just so naive. and while i didn't count i am pretty sure that kind of bs made up at least 10 minutes of each episode -.- \\n\r\n\"but what about all the cute guys?\" well, they are the shallow \"oh hey, you look promising... oh no whyyy, where are you character that i wanted you to be\"-kind, trust me. it is a pathetic way of saying \"we know the show sucks so we use prototypes of goodlooking characters in order to get everybodys hopes up, but... \"\\n\\n\r\nthe best part (haha) is that episode 11 & 12 reveal a big twist. ok ok, i give it some credit: the turn of events is super unexpected, the backstory is explained and the tragic events happening are super satisfying to watch. while i don't particularly dislike the feeling of finally seeing something interesting happening the twist also kinda tries to justify why all the episodes before had to be boring in the first place!! xD\\n\\n\r\noh fuck that!! seriously?!? i want to feel nicely entertained all the way through!! \\n\r\nit could have been a gory piece of fun with a strong heroine and cool sidekicks!! \\n\r\nsadly, the coolest gory stuff you've already seen in those popular gifs and youtube videos while the anime has nothing more to offer than, well, making you mad (or drunk if you like drinking games and bad movies).\\n\r\n2 overall only because of the refreshingly crazy violence...",

            "content": "This series is actually horrible. It took me more than a couple times to get into this anime. As a spin-off of Blood + I did come into this series with high expectations. My first impression was that it was...interesting. I kept watching because I wanted to see how CLAMP would try to pull it off. I gave it a second chance because I liked the art style, but my opinion on that was quickly changed. What I will say is, don't come into this anime expecting it to be anything like Blood +. The only real connection I can find is that both protagonist'snames are Saya. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe heroine of Blood + is likable, and powerful, while the heroine of Blood-C is weak and definitely does not keep her promises. As awful as the main character was, the other characters did not do any justice whatsoever. I am only giving the characters' portion a three out of ten because, surprisingly, there was one decent character whom I enjoyed throughout the series. Only one.\\n\\n\r\nStory 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI didn't see an actual explanation of what was going on until about episode three. So until that episode three, I was watching this girl kill these random statue monsters without knowing what they were or even why they were there. I never thought I would actually have to guess what was going on. And all of these things she was doing was probably not legal, or logical. I honestly don't find a huge man-eating bunny to be very relevant, because first of all, bunnies are cute and secondly, I half expected what Saya was to be killing to be vampires or at least something mildly scary. The worst part about it, is that when I did finally figure out what was going on, I was still confused. That being said, the way they explained things in this show was utterly disconcerting and caused confusion.\\n\\n\r\nArt 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, I actually really liked the art when I saw it the first time. I thought that Saya looked super adorable with her glasses and long black hair. And then, I saw their bodies. I'm sorry, but I'm not too fond of lanky, disproportionate, stick bodies. Enough said.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would have to rate this show a 2/10 at best. I enjoyed some parts of it, like when the evil bunnies ate everyone and when the show was finally over.  \\n",

            "content": "First things first. Don't you dare talk about this series if you didn't see until the last episode. It's not just about plot twists or anything, you simple don't know anything if you didn't saw. Story with no progress? Dense characters? I really want to spoil a ton of things to those who said those craps about this serie but i wont. \r\nOk it's my first review and i'm not fluent in english but i'll try to do a decent work here because I just can't stand people talking anything they want about this anime when they dropped after two episodes.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe problem here isthat I can't tell anything about the true story without spoil a lot of important things. I admit, i thought it was going to be about nothing more than a girl with a sword and tons of blood, and if you didn't see at least to ep. 10 you'll think that too. In the first episode you'll see Saya doing her routine, going to school, and in the last third of the ep she receive a sword from her father and is send to fight a monster. It's no just any fight, like you see in any shounen with background changes, a lot of useless conversation and lot of explosions and effects. No, it's like a real fight (if you don't mind the monster), you got fluid moviments, incredible sword techniques, i just can't explain, youtube it if you want to know.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's beautifull, simple beautifull, backgrounds, characters, fights, everything. Too bad there is no lolis, but we can get over it because everything is so well done.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, i don't really pay too much atention to sound, if the op or ed are too bad i'll just skip it. Nothing to talk about here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHere is a problem. I know, the characters are just dense, stereotyped and don't show any progress. But again, if you say that you simple didn't see everything to the end. I can't say too much, in fact, I can't say anything, because you simple don't know anything until the end. But believe me, if you watch until the last episode, you'll understand that those dense and stereotyped characters fit their roles in the story and I can tell you that every single one of the characters is important, even those strange twins.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYou may think it's painfull to watch an anime that just start to clear things after the tenth ep. But know what, i didn't even noticed it was already at the end when they started to reveal things. Each episode was so good that i still don't believe they all have 24 min, seriously, i don't remember how many times i've gone \"Eh? End? Already? Seriously?\". And hell, I could watch a full 200 ep of Saya fighting Elder Brains without getting tired. That's how increadible the whole thing seems to me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you just watched two~three eps and are going to drop this anime, fine, you really, seriosly don't even start to having a clue of what you're losing. I know, if you just value plot over incredible fight scenes, waiting until the very end to know anything is just painfull. But believe me, it's worth enduring it (watch a girl covered in blood with a sword fighting giant monsters, painfull, really). Well, just try it. But please, if you didn't watch the whole thing, stop talking nosense, you just don't know anything abou the plot, seriously, absolutelly nothing.",

            "content": "With a good dose of skepticism I began watching this (short) anime in German Dub. And without knowing its predecessors Blood+ & The Last Vampire all I knew of this movie was its mediocre reviews.\r\nFirst Impression: Great Visual Art Style, Good Character-design and overall Artwork. Movements are also really good (dodging in the water or pulling the katana from its sheath). Standing out as well was the wonderful music with a violin-main-theme and some roaring action-themes.\r\nThe story begins really calm and takes it time to build up the characters in school, at the cafe or at the shrine in her home with her father. Thecharacters seem realistic and likeable (The twins got on my neves in the end though). Therefore it takes a while, until the real Story picks up speed.\\n\r\nBut not only the story takes its time, but also the gore, I am no fan of. I even dropped Elfen Lied for the exact same reason and Blood C did well in showing the gore only after some episodes, so I didn't wanted to stop anymore. Most parts it is in a reasonable frame showing the evil demons, but in the end it was a bit too over the top and unnecessary.\\n\r\nThe fights themselves look really great in terms of animation and choreo, even though you never see anyone else than Saya fighting making it a little bit repetitive.\\n\r\nHaving some unexpected story twists and some likeable characters, I found the anime to be really good in the end and I'm looking forward to finish the series with the movie \"The Last Dark\".\\n\r\nIt is definitely no masterpiece, but most of the flame and low scores are not fair and therefore I give this anime a 8/10 for increasing the average score, while you as a patient reader can look at it as a 7.",

            "content": "Blood-C is definitely not the worst anime I've ever watched, but very far from the best. First of all, if you have a weak stomach, don't watch this anime.\r\n---STORY--- 3\r\nA story about a schoolgirl fighting monsters. Yep. That's the entire plot. Nearly every episode it is the same thing; a boring day on school, and then at night a gory fight with a monster. There is almost no progress in the story, and until the last episodes nothing is revealed about the mysterious monsters she is fighting. In the end the writer tries to catch your attention again with A HUGE TWIST, but he orshe fails, as it was an expected and quite stupid twist.\\n\\n\r\n---ART--- 7\\n\r\nDecent art. All guys look a bit too much like females, but the rest is okay. Females look extremely young and cute. Nothing special about it. The monsters look pretty good thou.\\n\\n\r\n---SOUND--- 6\\n\r\nAs I am not Japanese, I can not decide whether the voice actors are good or not, but they sound good to me. The opening is a weird mix of French, Engrish and Japanese, but it is okay.\\n\\n\r\n---CHARACTER--- 2\\n\r\nEverybody but the main character has no story. I'm serious. They are boring people without any personality. They are like decorations, just being there without purpose. Well, they have a purpose... to die horribly. So the main character does have a story, which is extremely lame and vague. She is your typical clumsy and cute girl that turns into a monster hunter at night. Apparently her goal is to save everyone, but she fails horribly. When people are about to get killed by monsters, she just waits politely until he finishes.  She seems to get heavily injured after every battle, but somehow is the next day completely healed. In other words, these 'characters' are just horrible.\\n\\n\r\n---ENJOYMENT--- 3\\n\r\nUnless you really like seeing people's organs, I don't think you can really 'enjoy' this anime. The battles are sometimes interesting, but not interesting enough to cover the horrible story line and characters. After a few episodes you probably will be bored already, as there is almost no progress.\\n\\n\r\n---OVERALL--- 4\\n\r\nUnless you really like gore, you will not enjoy nor like this anime. It has a bad plot and almost no character development. The art and sound are the only things that saved this anime from even getting a lower rating.",

            "content": "So far from the two episodes I have seen, it is still not clear what the story is. Is she just going to chop up monsters for 13, 26 episodes? Hopefully not because then it would be a huge disappointment. So far we have seen two episodes of pretty much the same thing Saya wakes up, eats at that cafe, sings, goes to school, has some kind of interaction with some character, goes home and at night goes out \"hunting\" for monsters. I wouldn't have mind if it were just the 1st episode, but the same thing for the 2nd? Come on Clamp. They try(I guess) to make it interesting with questions regarding certain objects like for example a sweet that Saya eats at the Cafe supposedly is suppose to feel like something and then later Saya finds out that it feels like a kiss according to the twins, which kind of left me like, \"what that's it?\" It was a waste of time in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt wise it isn't bad, but you might not like it if you don't like the Clamp style of art with the long limbs and thin look on characters. Action wise it is done well with good fluidity and motion, but some of the scenes were too dark to see clearly what the heck was going on. Personally I like the art, but wish they'd fix up the issue with those \"too\" dark scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound wise I really like the opening song. Catchy. Voice acting isn't bad, but we aren't really introduced to a very complicated or great script here. Some of the time there is lots of silence, which can lead to boredom. The fighting sounds are pretty good though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, so far are pretty weak. We do not know much about them at all. You would think by this time at least there would be some more info on Saya and her father, but we don't have any of that. It appears that the next episode will explain this to us, but with the way things are going I'm not getting my hopes up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall, first episode was enjoyable, but with the repetitive nature of the 2nd episode, I got kind of bored of it. Repetitiveness and no story line is what made me drop \"Blade\" in the first place, I seriously hope they move the story along because I'll probably drop this if they don't. So far I have to give it a 6. It's pretty mediocre, but the art and a few songs save it from being a lot worse.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT:\\n\\n\r\nWell I watched the 3rd episode and it was for the most part the same thing as the previous two, just with a little bit more twist, which imho isn't enough to really merit a higher score. I gotta say I'm quite disappointed. They spend half of the episode with pointless blabber and about the only thing interesting are the fights mainly due to the unique enemies Saya faces.I think from now on I'll just watch the 2nd halves of the show, since the rest imho is pure crap.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT:\\n\\n\r\nI watched the 4th episode today and well, it was pretty much the same thing again, but we got a little bit more info on who exactly Saya is fighting. Even so, the information is pretty vague and simplistic. The pace of the story is horribly slow.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT:\\n\\n\r\nFinally we get to some better action. So we find out more about the covenant. Basically it appears to be some sort of agreement between humans and the monsters, exactly what? We still don't know, but the way this episode 5 was structured it really kept you watching. I don't know how the heck they didn't do this for the past 4 episodes, it would have made a big difference even with the slow plot. The music has really grown on me. I love the opening and ending songs and the eerie song that is transposed into different was throughout the anime is done very well, still the story is really slow, like snail slow. You have to have a lot of patience.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the latest episode it seems that the monsters have pretty much found out who Saya is and have even targeted her friends. It looks like the story is reaching it's middle part. It became a lot more interesting since the last one. Now we see better sequences in the story, still lacking, but better nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nFinal edit: Well after finishing this I gotta say it really comes together at the end, but at the cost of keeping the audience excited for more than half the series. For the first few episodes you are given the run around with Saya doing the same thing (probably a result of the plot) which can cause people to lose their patience and drop this one. As the story progressed near the end you are given hints of what is going and eventually it is all revealed in the last episode. Also the the final episodes are extremely gory so caution for those that don't like to see that (I don't mind). Only downside of the end? You are given a cliffhanger. Whether you like it or not is up to you. I think if it's well done, it's ok. I give it a 7 overall.",

Well, hate to break it to you but, I have and I love blood+ very much, this one I agree is not as good but, I still have strong feelings for this one. You can have your on opinion but, nobody seems to like this anime. \r\nThe story: Love it : 9 , Saya is really epic in this one just like the last, I like how she switches attitudes. O\r\nThe Art: Love it:9, I just love how Clamp draws but, the legs were extremely long, Saya was really cute too :)\\n\r\nThe sound: Liked it:7, I didn't really like the opening song, it sounded like something that should be on Pokemon\\n\r\nThe Characters: Loved that also: 9, Saya and that boy with the black hair are really cute together\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Loves : 9, I thought the whole blood world is really awesome\\n\r\nOverall: Absolutely awesome: 9, I don't usually rate anime this high unless I feel they have good potential.

However, the show itself hints something which is related to Blood series and this is the thing that those people forgot about.\r\nI have to admit that I watched this show because Mizuki Nana with no knowledge about Blood series and it was so wrong idea. If anyone decides to watch it, I recommend you watch Blood+ or Blood: the last vampire first because the storyline will easily mesmerize audiences with expectation. If you're too lazy to watch the previous Blood series like me, I think it's still o.k. as wellbecause you'll get more excitement and imagination.",

            "content": "Oh Blood-C, you could have been a great anime if you tried. \r\nStory\r\nIf your familiar with the previous Blood franchise then you know what you are getting; a sword wielding badass kicking some monster butt. Sounds awesome right? Unfortunately no matter how cool the fighting scenes were in this anime, it was watered down by the incredibly dull dialogues  between the paper thin characters and the slow paced story. To make it short, there is no real development in this anime until the last two episodes and trust me, it's not worth going through 10 episodes of Saya's amazingly boring daily life just tosee that. The twist in the end is the only saving grace of this anime. However the ending is far from perfect; it leaves a lot if unanswered questions. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI do not like CLAMP's art, the gangly thin bodies freak me out. I was kind of annoyed with Saya's gravity defying pigtails but it's a minor complaint. Everything else was just fine. The fighting scenes were great.   \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI can't remember anything worth mentioning about the OST, so it was probably average. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nCharacters? What characters?\\n\r\nJokes aside, all the characters felt like cutouts. You have the seemingly innocent klutz that turns into a monster killing machine at night, the bad boy and the class president that is interested in her, the annoying twins and the level headed friend (oh and the nice \"family friend\"). Of course the anime tries to redeem itself in the end by the shocking ending but frankly I didn't care about the characters in the first place so it lacked impact. *yawn* The only character I was slightly interested in was Fumito.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThe fighting scenes are enjoyable and so is the ending. The rest is Saya and her cookie-cutter friends hanging out. I will leave you to decide whether it's worth it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nIf the story was more fleshed out and the interaction between the characters were more believable (feels so damn staged) it would have been a decent anime. However the anime failed to do so. If you must watch this anime, skip every episode to the fighting scene except for the two last episodes. Makes the whole anime much more enjoyable. \\n",

            "content": "I have a certain hate against wasted potential and tend to be harsher toward those series.  Yet, I find myself sometime to highly contradict my way of reviewing with some shows that should deserve plain hate for legitimate reasons, but end up by being one hell of a show for me.  It\u2019s true; Blood-C should have all the merit of being a bad show, and a very bad one I must say. The protagonist is an oblivious dumb girl, the story doesn\u2019t go anywhere and the violence is plainly gratuitous. Certainly, nothing of quality should be left after that.  However, it\u2019s actuallyfor these very same reasons why I absolutely adore Blood-C, placing it in my top shows of 2011.\\n\\n\r\nThere is lack of caring and drama in Blood-C that makes it pure entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nFor one thing, Blood-C is very dry with its story telling. The first episode consists of Saya in her everyday life where she would go to school, meet with her friends and sing a joyful song, until she goes back home and beat the crap out of a monster.  As Saya isn\u2019t questioning her role, nor does she mix her secret life with school, the story really lacks at explaining what is really happening with the monsters, or the nature of their existence. In contradiction, the force of show actually resides in the fights between Saya and the enemies. Surely, the fight scenes should be labeled as pointless, too long and way too violent for no reasons, but it\u2019s actually the first time in my life where I truly admired Clamp\u2019s work. As it is, while the fights were great at showing off Saya\u2019s personality, which is quite lacking logical emotional feelings, the way it depicted the monsters was absolutely fascinating. It is not rare to see an anime with monsters killing humans, but blood-c did it in a way where those creatures actually acted like real monsters. They don\u2019t act on feelings of hate and lust of blood; they act on instinct which makes them more terrifying than your typical shounen antagonist.  The big problem with blood-c is actually how far one need to suspend his disbelief.  Even if the obvious contradictions worked as foreshadowing elements, it is not beyond the fact that the village is very dumb and stupid and that Saya has one of the most contradicting personality ever made in anime. For me, I enjoyed the story for what it was. It stayed true to its business, and didn\u2019t go into something deep and useless. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there\u2019s a lot to say about Saya, the monster hunter. Probably hailed as one of the most worthless hero of the year, she makes use of the \u201cprotect everyone\u201d trope quite actually well. By that, I mean that she doesn\u2019t protect anyone, nor does she actually feel bad about it. If she would fail to protect someone, the next day she would sing a song about the nice weather.  And again, she doesn\u2019t question her supposable super powers and her extreme headache. Quite the dumb heroine I must say.  On the other side, the other characters don\u2019t really serve any purposes other than being gore material.\\n\\n\r\n Visually, Blood-C has the reputation of being one hell of a bloody mess.  Regretfully, most of us had to deal with the censorship that, while it wasn\u2019t too bad, was definitely taking away some of the experience. As for the monsters design, it has to be some of the slickest and interesting ones I\u2019ve seen in a while. In comparison, it is fair to say to it resembles some of the creatures in Mohiroh\u2019s works.  As for the character design and the environment, there\u2019s really nothing much to say. If there\u2019s one thing that would stand out as being original, it probably would the school uniform that I actually rather liked.  The animation is actually handled quite well. For sure, some of the fighting animation might feel awkward, but the studio did use the monsters to their capacities, which makes them feel more real and alive.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is not really distinctive in the anime. It accords itself to the situation, but there isn\u2019t any wow factor. Opening song is good, ending song is forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this review tended to explain Blood-C for what it is. Either way, you may find yourself that you\u2019ll hate or love this show after reading this.  And for me, I\u2019ll have to place myself in the loving camp. For what it is, Blood-C works remarkably well at lacking anything deep, not trying too hard and simply being mild entertainment.\\n",

The story is very good as you kinda know what is going to happen throughout the show. Let me tell you this, it is NOT whatever you thought. I'm not gonna go into too much detail as I'd rather not spoil it for anyone who'd like to watch Blood C.\r\nBlood C is a really good anime as you'll get to know all the characters and you'll like all of them. The show starts off a little slow but it's totally worth finishingit. This anime is the first anime I have ever seen in my life that had a plot twist that hits you like a fricking truck. The art isn't really something that extraordinary but still okay. If you love gore, death and supernatural beings, this anime is for you!",

But anyways...\r\n1. Story and direction - weak. The background story is not being properly introduced (or rather not being introduced at all to the audience). We had to make assumptions. Poor directions -  not knowing where this is going and this is the bad kind of \"not-knowing\" and the worse kind of \"lost\". Overused storyline left a badtaste in the mouth like the leftovers from 2 days ago (i.e. the girl is going to school and singing to herself about how good the weather is, then saw a dog-like creature, contemplating whether to touch / pat its head or not while realizing she's already late for school, decided not to and dashes to the school, girigiri safe as the teacher is about to check the attendance. Repeat for at least 3 episodes). Score = 2 [Worse, could not be tolerated, too late to be corrected].\\n\\n\r\n2. Animation - not that bad, but very generic CLAMP animation's characteristics. Censorship or not, it could not save this series. Very dull colors but at least it is not as pathetic as Togainu no Chi's overall quality of animation. TogaChi is on its own level of dreadfulness and eye cancer to the max, but that's another story. Score = 5 [Average, not too bad but not remarkably done either].\\n\\n\r\n3. Characters - very poor. Also, generic CLAMP characters that could be found in most of their work. Characters with really long legs, megane, twins, insufferably kind people, twin tailed girls, silent male characters, recycle characters from other CLAMP works (hello, Watanuki.. so you're a dog now, huh?), basically useless characters that made us wonder what is the purpose of these characters and whether they would do this series any good by appearing in it. I couldn't find myself to like any of these characters and at some point, I was glad that they died. I do not feel any connection to any of the characters. Score = 1 [Worst, but still get a point for trying].\\n\\n\r\n4. Voice acting - poor. Mizuki Nana should focus on singing. Fujiwara Keiji should not focus to voicing father/dad characters and should voice badass characters like Ali Al-Saachez (god I hate him in this but he's done a good job to make me hate the character), Ladd Russo (so badass I think Shizuo is the Ikebukuro version of Ladd Russo), Maes Hughes (so he's a father but also a badass soldier and confidant) and Sonchou (who'd resist a kappa?). Other voice actors done a fairly average, to forgettable acting. Score = 2 [Worse, could not be tolerated, too late to be corrected, a disappointment].\\n\\n\r\n5. Sound (OP / ED / BGM) - below average. Forgettable OP, generic Nana ED, pretty cool BGM at times, oh wait, only one theme sounds cool. Failed to remember others. Score = 3 [Below average, does not leave any impression, passable].\\n\\n\r\nTotal score = Story/direction (2) + Animation (5) + Characters (1) + Voice acting (2) + Sound (3) = 13\\n\\n\r\n--> Overall rating: 13/5 = 2.6 (rounded to 3 because I'm trying reduce the amount of my pessimism).\\n\\n",

            "content": "As a fan of Blood+, Blood C anime would be definitely a good news. When I saw the first episode of the series, I thought that the battle scene is somewhat like from the Blood+ and that's all I can see. To start of: \r\nSTORY - 7\r\nThere is this typical high school girl named Saya and she always go to school every morning, but every night, Saya was tasked by her father to slay off furukimono-tachi (Elder Bairns). From episode 1 - 12, you can always see that and nothing more. I'm a bit disappointed with the anime because I really hoped for a uniqueplot that's coming from the Blood series and all we get is those battle scenes (though at some point I can't deny that they're still good when the series is in its middle airing). \\n\\n\r\nART - 8\\n\r\nIn one glance, anyone can tell. With those skinny and tall characters, those eyes are like of a doll and sweet and bishie faces that is similar to xxxHolic, Tsubasa Chronicles, CLAMP would be the first thing that came into my mind. The art, although not similar with Blood+, suits Blood C in a unique way and it fits with a bloody/thrilling anime. \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/SOUND - 7\\n\r\nOP and ED of this series is nice and you can feel the aura that it's all about monster slaying demon's type.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 7\\n\r\nA girl who fights demons is not that common. Saya's character is a cheerful type in morning and a serious type at night. Indeed, it is like a shounen character. Her friends characterization is good though these things are very common in this type of anime. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 7\\n\r\nTo sum things up, the story is somewhat boring within the first, but still I continued to watch it and some episodes were good and exciting. The main characters reminded me of a mixed up in some of CLAMP series and also, the most related anime, Blood+. The art is good and this is also one of the reasons why I continued and finish to watch Blood C. The OP/ED is good, others are okay. If you're a fan of a dark/gory/thrilling anime, this should fit your taste.",

I could have finished this series in 1-2 days but it took me a week because it was THAT boring for me. What the heck is wrong with this series?\r\nThe plot was there. Art was good (bishounens, anorexic (err, very thin) characters with long extremities, and very good details in costumes and the setting. Yup, definitely CLAMP). Blood and gore, check. My major problem is the slow pacing. Yes, for a 12-episode anime it's slowin terms of progress. Add the fact that the first few episodes were, how do I call this, routine episodes/episodes that pretty much contain the same things with minor variations here and there, and it's only in the last 3 episodes that the series managed to redeem itself, although they seemed to suddenly attack head on and fitted all the major happenings into the last few episodes. Kind of like how students cram at the very last minute. Please don't get me started on comparing it with its predecessor because this might end up as a comparative essay rather than a review. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Blood C is good and its only major problem is the very slow pace. If you're a fan of Blood franchise and/or of CLAMP and you can ignore the progress of the story, go ahead and give this anime a chance.",

            "content": "Hello and welcome to horror anime review month. To start things off I'm going to look at Blood-C. I've heard of this for two reasons. The first is that it's related to Blood+ which I may review at some point but haven't gotten around to it yet. The second is that a lot of the Blood+ fans hate it. Now, I've seen Blood+ and to give my thoughts about it in brief, it's okay. I thought that it did some things pretty well and others kind of poorly. Am I going to be ticked off if Blood C doesn't follow it? No, no I'm not.Frankly I don't care what they do with the franchise as long as it tells a good story. The one thing I'm really hoping for is a less whiny Saya because the Blood+ version got on my nerves a bit. So let's take a look at Blood C and see if we get an interesting story and, possibly, a better Saya.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've seen it, I just have to start by saying that I'm not going to be bringing up Blood+ for comparison purposes except for maybe when I talk about the character of Saya. The two anime are completely different so there's really not much to be gained by the comparison. Now, a lot of the big plot details are spoilers so I won't explicate on it too much. The basic setup is that Kisaragi Saya is a shrine maiden who lives in a small town with her father and fights monsters at night. But there's a secret that she only has vague inklings of. That's as far as I can go without giving spoilers. I will say that the horror label in this is code for \"it has monsters\" since the anime isn't scary in the least. There are things that the anime does well. The mystery surrounding everything is interesting and, once you learn the truth, the concept behind it is interesting. However, the execution is flawed in that the hints are pretty minimal and the reveal comes at the end when it's too late to do much with it. Another basic problem is that Blood-C lacks impact. A lot of the events that occur should be tragic but they aren't because there's not much reflection on them and a lot of them are rushed through.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a bit lackluster. The only really interesting characters are Saya and, arguably, the antagonist. The rest of the characters do and say very little aside from some exposition. I will say that I did like Blood-C's Saya better than the Blood+ version since she's more determined and a lot less angsty.\\n\\n\r\nYou can tell that Clamp was involved with this from the art. The characters have limbs that are too long for their bodies and tiny waists that shouldn't be able to hold all of their organs. I will say that it looks better than the art in Xxxholic. It's actually pretty decent if you can get past the proportions. The action sequences are really well done, even if the amount of blood that ignores the laws of physics to gush out of wounds is ridiculous. The monsters are pretty hit and miss. Some of them do look pretty interesting, but others just look silly.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is actually really well done. They had a great cast including Mizuki Nana (who is always excellent), Asano Masumi and Fujiwara Kenji. The music is good sometimes but others it's pretty underwhelming. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 4/10. There are some scenes involving Saya and her teacher or some of her female classmates that are pretty homo-erotic. They don't go anywhere though.\\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Blood-C is a 6/10. Like Blood+ it's okay. There are some things it does well and others where it falls short. Saya is a good character and there are some interesting ideas but the execution falls short and it really ends up being more of an action anime than anything else. If you're expecting it to be like Blood+, don't. But give it a try if you enjoy bloody battle sequences or if you're curious about the mystery.",

            "content": "If the middle finger were an anime, its name would be Blood C. Blood C is a reboot to the popular Blood franchise, following in the footsteps of Blood the Last Vampire and Blood+. It is brought to you by Production IG, the studio that handled both of the anime mentioned above, as well as other popular titles like Ghost in the Shell, Eden of the East, and most recently Robotics;Notes. The series composition and art were handled by the one and only CLAMP. Smells like a recipe for success doesn't it? So how in the world did things go so wrong?\r\n[ Story 1/10 ]\r\nThebare bones version of the story is the same as it was in the previous iterations of the Blood franchise. Powerful high school girl Saya slays dastardly demons with her almighty sword. Very simple. But the difference with Blood C is that it forces its boring slice of life side on us for the first 5 or so episodes. This wouldn't have been so bad if the characters had actually been interesting people who actually did things or discussed something interesting. At the end of the episode, we see Saya slaying demons, giving us a tiny glimpse of the Blood series that we know and love. Fortunately, the fight scenes are very well done and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nWe get no backstory on Saya until episode 11. Her boring friends get NONE. The story is almost nonexistant, mostly consisting of Saya doing boring stuff with her boring friends during the day, and slaying demons by night.  Many people die. Some people die twice. And its never pretty. Also, there's the surprise twist in Ep 11. The one no one saw coming. The one I don't want to spoil for you. The infuriating twist that makes you feel like you sat through this godforsaken anime for nothing. \\n\\n\r\nThe violence in Blood C is over the top, grotesque, and stomach churning. Now I know what you're going to say. \"Well duh! It's called BLOOD C!\"\\n\\n\r\nFair enough. But Blood C takes it violence to the extreme. It makes Blood+ and Blood the Last Vampire look like children's cartoons. It makes other notoriously violent anime such as Elfen Lied and Mirai Nikki seem like My Little Pony. Hell, it even puts some live action movies to shame. Blood C is extremely violent for no reason. The violence is disgusting, overdone, and put in there purely for the shock value. People get devoured in this anime. They get cut to bits. They literally get crushed and ripped apart. They get ground into pieces. Their limbs get cut off. And they bleed a lot. And to make things worse, its always coupled with some equally nasty sound effects. Here's a fun little fact. The human body contains about 5.6 liters of blood. Clearly the creators of Blood C were like \"No! Fuck logic! Lets give everyone in this anime 5 whole gallons of blood and make them into human geysers! And quadruple that for any monster!\"\\n\\n\r\nThe last episode is probably one of the most disgusting things you'll ever see in an anime. By that point, the anime had just gotten so far up its own ass that it had turned into unintentional comedy. Or at least it was until monsters starting killing and eating hordes of people. Arguably one the worst scenes in the anime is when a monster stuffs a bunch of humans together in what looked like a huge bag, changes its hand into a sort of blender, and grinds up the horde of humans with blood flying everywhere. Now is all that necessary? No it is not. \\n\\n\r\nNow there is nothing wrong with some violence in fictional entertainment. But there is a limit to what a human can take before it stops being entertaining and starts getting sickening. Blood C took a huge honking dump on that limit.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, here's a summary of the story: moe, moe, moe, LET'S KILL A BUNCH OF PEOPLE, moe, moe, moe.\\n\\n\r\n[ Characters 1/10 ]\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are all unlikeable. Our main heroine Saya is generically cheerful, cute, and klutzy. She's always tripping over herself, yet she's skilled in sports and with the sword, which makes no sense. To reiterate, the only backstory she gets in a stupid twist near the end of the anime. She goes on and on about protecting everyone, yet in multiple scenes where monsters are mercilessly slaughtering people, she just stands there and does nothing until after everyone is dead and cut up. Ironically, whenever Saya vows to protect everyone, people die. She's an annoying and poor heroine.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting characters are all one dimensional archetypes with no personalities to speak of. They get no backstory, no development, and you won't even care what their names are. Though to be fair, you may like some of the supporting characters at first. Until that infernal surprise twist. \\n\\n\r\n[ Art and Sound 8/10 ]\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are the best parts of the anime. The anime sports some fluid animation and some pretty sweet fight scenes between Saya and the monsters. Well that is, when they're actually trying to animate a great fight scene and not just trying to make you throw up. CLAMP handled the gorgeous character designs so no complaints there either. Equal care was put in to the beautiful, sunny, lush town that the anime takes place in. \\n\\n\r\nOpening and Ending themes were ok. The insert songs are forgettable.\\n\\n\r\n[ Enjoyment 2/10 ]\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed looking at the great art and some of the fight scenes. Like I said, by episode 11, the anime had gotten so bad that it became unintentional comedy. The only reason I didn't rate it a 1/10 is because I was able to get a laugh out of this anime. And it's not even a comedy! Amazing! But I would not watch this anime again, nor would I recommend it to anyone, unless I really hated them.\\n\\n\r\n[ Overall 2/10]\\n\\n\r\nBlood C is a train wreck of an anime that crashes and burns pretty badly. What could have been a decent action anime becomes a comedic gore fest galore. I got to wonder what kind of drugs were passed around when this anime was conceived. I wonder how such talented people could churn out such a disappointing and disgusting anime. Fans of the Blood franchise and maybe even fans of action anime in general should steer clear, there really is nothing to see here but an anime that insults your intelligence and turns your stomach. \\n\\n\r\n+ Superb art and animation\\n\r\n+ Great fight scenes\\n\r\n+ Great character designs\\n\r\n- Abysmal story\\n\r\n- Unlikeable, uninteresting characters\\n\r\n- Stupid plot twist \\n\r\n- Terrible cliffhanger ending\\n\r\n- Unnecessary, grotesque, and nauseating depictions of characters frequently being mercilessly butchered or devoured\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "After having watched this a few months ago and concluded that it sucked! ... I'm surprised by how much I think about this show.\r\nBlood C is a violent anime. A very very very violent Anime. Maybe even shockingly so. I watched Elfen Lied and that seems almost elegant compared to this.\r\nMaybe it's the copious amounts of blood and gore, maybe it's the sheer viciousness with which characters are unceremoniously dispatched, maybe it's how exasperatingly inept the main character seems to be, either way, I'm convinced now that Blood C is a show that is much better in retrospect than it while you're watching it.\r\nMost peoplewatching Blood C do so because they're trying to get a bit more out of the Saya story, and are maybe even hoping for some continuity with Blood +. Well, no such thing. This show's all new, and while some of the basic themes remain the same, everything else is completely different.\\n\\n\r\nHere's the thing, I hated this show while I was watching it. I thought the main character was pretty much brain dead, and I found myself yelling at my screen more than once. But Blood C is like a scar on your soul that stays with you once inflicted, and over time, you may come to see it as a unique part of yourself, and even think fondly of it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I can't say I think fondly of Blood C, I must say that few anime's have stuck with me the way this one has. There's just something about the setting, the fights, the characters, hec the entire plot, that is very very creepy when you think about it. And it's insight into human nature is certainly not appreciated at first - no, that comes after you've stopped hating this version of Saya. No, the subtle genius of this show only becomes clear in hind sight.\\n\\n\r\nI still can't put into words why I think this show is worth watching, but it's a definite for any fan of the blood series. I won't promise that you will like it, but I will promise that you will not soon forget it!",

There is no real story line until much later on and this can seriously put watchers off. There is a lot of mindless gore which kind of makes it unique but it doesn't really get into it until around the last few episodes.\r\nCharacter-3: There is literally no background to any character, no depth or explanation, even saya is hardly explained, why is she what she is (without giving away any spoilers).\r\nArt-8: However this anime is beautifully created, the detail and texture of the surroundings is beautifuland you can see the detailed water painting in some scenes, the fight sequences are also very well animated which is one of the few good points about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound-8: The music played, is literally amazing, the orchestrated pieces suited each scene perfectly and added an effect that you rarely get in anime, but was slightly let down as it was overused quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Im giving it a generous 7 as the last few episodes picked it up and scraped together such a poor start and also because I loved the art work, though I can see why people gave it a rating of less than 5.",

            "content": "Blood-C, the anime I mystically pulled through despite the lack of immersion. One would expect that anime under tags like ''horror'', ''mystery'' and ''supernatural'' would have some spice to it, however, it does not. All it has to offer is sloppy gore. \r\nReally, if you're looking for something with a bit more depth than a run-through in a slaughterhouse, this anime is not for you. The story is quite poor and repetitive, and while there might be scenes that could make you feel like the characters are likable, it just doesn't deliver in a way that could make that feeling linger. Given that, when theweak storyline pulls any twists, I found it hard to empathize or feel astounded.\\n\\n\r\n[[[slight spoilers ahead]]] The main, big twist - the ending - felt kind of forced, as if the anime was trying to save itself from the repetitive scenes and situations. While yes, it was not expected by me in any way, it just felt so unnatural, like it did not belong there. If we add my other point about the lack of memorable and/or charismatic characters, the ending caused me no feelings whatsoever... Which is really unfortunate for an anime. [[[end of slight spoilers]]]\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would not recommend this anime to anybody. It's just very, very mediocre and I don't think you should waste your time on it. It has one good thing though - the opening. The French in it gave me chills... that's it. It's really not worth your time.",

One thing is clear though - it is another story, not a sequel, prequel or anything to Blood+, so everything is possible and strange things may happen.\r\nThe first 3 episodes gave subtle hints. A bit strange phrase here, a look there, a slightly illogical act or a somewhat misplaced object. The 4-th episode adds more of that, but also makes some mysteries clear and evident. A great setting is ready, but it is yet unclear if this anime will perform to expectations.\r\nStory: 7. Actually, n/a- it is too early to tell. Maybe 10. Maybe 4, no less.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9. The drawing is ordinary in style, possibly classical, but very well done. Colors match one another exceptionally well and the color style is not that common. The screen goes from colorful to almost monochrome or even black and white and back. We often see 2 layers, each in its own palette, separating objects into 2 groups and guiding our attention. The key protagonist colors are white, black, and red.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7. It is good, well matched with video, effects are cleverly used and voices are very good, but this is that which must be expected from a year 2011 anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7. Actually, n/a again - too early to tell. Maybe 8, I guess they should be almost typical and thus not 9 or 10, maybe 6, if they stop developing. It is also well possible that some key characters are still unknown.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10. It is 10 for sure with my growing expectations and still 10 without them. Just a pleasure to view and listen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9. May I bet this one lives to expectations?",

            "content": "Ohh dear where to start?, Ok let's try with what it is and what it isn't\r\nWhat it isn't (probably it's biggest problem):\r\nIf you're looking for a well thought horror/gore anime, move along, there's nothing good to see here...does it have gore?, yes, tons, is it any good? no; why? because even though we see a ton of dismemberment through out the show, you rarely ever get to care about who is getting ripped apart, the character development in this anime is non-existent, they try, but the only thing they accomplish is setting relationship dynamics they expect us to take on \"face value\" (it's better toshow than to tell) between cookie cutter characters like the unison sounding mutual sentence finishing twins, the serious yet shy class rep., the tall feisty macho girl, and the silent yet charming mysterious cool dude, you get my drift.\\n\\n\r\nThis is something quite surprising considering the amount of episodes dedicated to using a \"slice of life\" type format, some may say it's only for 5 episodes, but with the show lasting 12 eps. that's almost half, so to not get character development right, and to not establish relation dynamics through show rather than tell, well that's pretty off setting, and it hinders most of the deaths of those who die, and the effect and feeling those deaths cause to the audience, remember Gantz? how you felt when some one you've just started to like died?, yeah that ain't happening here, trust me you wont care.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the Other big issue: the sense of it all, and the convenience, when you're watching a fight scene and you feel frustrated of how the fight is going, it usually has to do with ether of 2 things depending on the genre: either the events in the fight go against the power hierarchy the show has established in it's universe (this happens most in shounen when a character that shouldn't be able to beat another, starts kicking the shit out of him with no feasible explanation), or you realize the character you're rooting for (you know the good guy/gall) starts doing stupid shit that even you can recognize as inefficient and moot, or nonsensical, in the case of Blood-C the latter of these happens, and it happens a lot. This diminishes the consistency and coherence of the narrative in a considerable manner, making you really get aaaaall the plot holes at once, which obviously sucks, good anime usually requires a second viewing for you to spot them.\\n\\n\r\nThe final issue that this show has is, it completely butchers the mythos of the previous entries in the franchise had, as well as neutering the main character, bad ass Saya.   \\n\\n\r\nNow let's wrap this up,\\n\\n\r\nWhat it is:\\n\\n\r\nSimply put? a bad anime, a nauseating and overly convenient excuse for gore and drama lashed upon inconsistent and irrelevant characters that fail to make you feel their hardships, although i will grant it this: the villain is a total ass hole and by the end you'll want to rip his spine through his butt hole, or mouth, which ever hurts more.\\n\\n\r\nSo is this worth watching? hell no!, don't throw 4 hours of your life at this piece of dung, go stare at your lawn instead, you'll feel better and it'll be more entertaining!.",

Read with discretion.\r\nBlood C is an installment of the Blood franchise, which contains one awesome movie, one crappy live-action movie, and a fifty episode series I still haven\u2019t seen. The star of Blood C is Saya Kisaragi, another incarnation of that iconic character... Don\u2019t ask... Who\u2019s a super popular, super pretty high school student by day, and a cold-blooded monster slayer by night. She lives with her father, and has five very loyal, very lively, very god-awful annoying friends.As the story goes on, and the monster attacks begin to strike closer and closer to home, Saya slowly begins to realize that there might be more to this situation than meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nBlood C was animated by a company called Production IG, which has been around since 1988. Taking a look back at their filmography, a lot of their work may look dated by today\u2019s standards, but there\u2019s no doubt that the majority of their shows were the best looking shows of their time. Blue Seed, FLCL, Ghost in the Shell SAC, and most recently, Attack on Titan. They\u2019re known for bringing their A game to most of their projects, and Blood C is no exception. Characters move fluidly, the fight scenes look awesome, and the artwork from Clamp looks equally inspired... But while Saya and the monsters she faces may look really good, it\u2019s her friends that make the art design look a bit... awkward.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, the story is kind of a mixed bag. You have to deal with Saya\u2019s friends at school, as they openly parody Clamp\u2019s notorious character design tropes... I wonder why they bothered, since they already did such a good job of that in xxxHolic without even trying... But on the other side of the coin, you have Saya\u2019s battles with the monsters, which is a plot seed that starts off with a lot of promise. You see her fighting one on one with some kind of gargoyle, which is a lot of fun to watch, but then you get to see her fight the very monster that drew me into the series... Eyeball Samurai. This fight didn't disappoint, either. It\u2019s staged well, it\u2019s paced well, it ends on a great note, and Saya actually manages to save some poor girl from being killed. She saves somebody\u2019s life. Why am I drawing so much attention to this? Well...  To speak in the broadest possible strokes, it's her job to save people from being gruesomely murdered, and she is blisteringly incompetent at it. Hell, this girl couldn\u2019t save a sandwich with a Ziploc bag!  \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll admit that it\u2019s kind of cathartic seeing monsters devour her irritating friends, but it doesn\u2019t take very long to see the real reason why she can\u2019t save any of them. The real reason why her power is so conveniently inconsistent. As good as this show looks, and as much promise as it shows, it\u2019s gore porn. It\u2019s not a horror title, it\u2019s not an action title, oh no, it\u2019s gore porn. The main character\u2019s credibility isn\u2019t important,... The dialogue isn\u2019t important... The story isn\u2019t important... The villain\u2019s motivation is certainly not important... All that Blood C cares about is delivering as much gore porn as possible, and if every other aspect of the show has to dumb itself down to accommodate this, then so be it.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say that it doesn\u2019t TRY to be more than the sum of it\u2019s body parts... There\u2019s some social commentary on mankind\u2019s relationship to the food chain, but the way it\u2019s delivered is just heavy-handed, tasteless, and a transparent excuse for more gore porn. I don\u2019t mind gore porn... I will begrudgingly admit that I\u2019m a fan of Elfen Lied, a show riddled with problems of it\u2019s own. But at least there was more to Elfen Lied than it\u2019s fetishy abuse of red paint. The only elements of Blood C that had any real care or effort put into it was the art and animation, because they wanted better looking gore porn.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Blood C doesn\u2019t really have that much to offer. If you\u2019re looking for a gory anime that\u2018s centered around epic battles, you\u2019d have a much better experience watching Berserk. If you wanted to see giant monsters gobble terrified people up, you could just watch Attack on Titan, a show that does an exceptional job portraying the struggle against hopelessness. If you wanted to see an anime that pokes fun at man as a dominant predator, you could get that and so much more out of Madoka Magica. But Blood C dumbed itself down so much to maximize the squicky blood fountains that it unintentionally created one of the least effective heroes in the history of fiction.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to watch, and not in a good way, which is why I have no choice but to award Blood C with the dubious honor of a 4/10.  And I don't care what MAL says, that score is not decent.",

            "content": "I want to talk about the series on it's own merits first.  I've only seen four episodes thus far and it's likely my opinion will change when I've viewed the whole series.\r\nThe set up of atmosphere in this series works very nicely.  Right off the bat they begin throwing hints that not all is right in the town.  The more you get into it, the more things seem a little off somehow.  It really does make you wonder and make you curious to know just what is going on behind the scenes of this tiny little town.\r\nThe every day life bitsserve to punctuate the uncertainty of the rest of the series.  It's such a lovely, calm town and Saya's life is amazingly idealistic.  This only serves to make the skeptics out there wonder why it is so idealistic and if that isn't perhaps hiding something - besides the Bairn, of course.\\n\\n\r\nOn the same hand however, compared to the more gripping action scenes?  The every day life bits fall very flat, in my opinion.  The dialogue is uninteresting, we're not really invested in the other characters Saya is friendly with and a lot of it comes off as just something cute to fill up screen time.  It's not technically bad honestly and it does have it's funny moments.  However these funny moments are ones we've seen over and over in other series.\\n\\n\r\nIn comparing this to Blood+, which has it's share of every day scenes and normal day to day things?  Blood+ had the advantage that this normal stuff was a break from the intense action and drama that came on very quickly after the series began.  Likewise, the characters Saya Otonashi befriended were decently developed.  Some were more well-rounded than others but the characters we were expected to connect with and feel for were built up very well.\\n\\n\r\nWho knows, I have a feeling this lack of characterization may prove an important point later on in the series.  Or at least I *hope* it does, as that would make an interesting plot twist in my mind.",

            "content": "Many people seems to hate Blood-C, or at least, dislike it. I think i know why: they wanted a Blood + sequel or remake, with the same story, kuuderes bishonen like Haji and lots of action. Don't get me wrong, Blood + is good, but i think Blood -C is better because it risked more. It's not the typical shonen odf the high school MC who slays monsters andfights evil, it's a seinen with tons of blood and a interesting message.\r\nThe first episodes are slow, they show us Saya's life in the village with his father, going to school with her friends by day andslaying monsters called furikimonos by night. She lives every otaku's dream. But when her two lives starts to stop of being separeted, many of the creatures she fights attack her beloved ones, and despite all her powers, she can't help their deaths. This is an interesting way to show us that this life is not that wonderful we believe it is, and give us a hard lesson: unfortunetly, you can't save everyone you want to.\\n\r\nMany people complain aout the lack f action(???????) and why Saya doesn't discover anything, but i think they should rewatch the story and pay more attention to the plot and don't skip the fight scenes cause the gorey stuff and less attention in where the hell is Haji.Saya started to wonder since the furikimonos started to talk to her, but she didn't trust them becuase they are supposed to be human flesh- eating monsters, her enemies. But then everything started to be more and more suspicious, and Saya didn't realize before for one simple reason: she doesn't wanna discover the truth.Despite is fake, is her life and she's happy with it.\\n\r\nThe final twist is not the happy end we get used to, with the hero defeating the villain. The villain destroys Saya's life, the life he created for her, because she finally discover the truth after being forced to by people she trusted and thought they loved her, just for their own intterests and benefits. I must say it: Fumito is one of my favourite villains. Really nice, more complex that he looks, and with the psycho i love.\\n\r\nThe show takes a lot of anime clich\u00e9s, many of them own CLAMP's fault, like the love triangle, the mysterious dark-haired bishonen that loves secretly the heroine, the kawaii twins and , of course, the high school teenager with a secret life fighting the evil, and destroy all of them.\\n\r\nThe gore, one of the points more commented of the shows, it didn't feel out of place to me: it's a story of monsters eating humans, there must be blood, of course.\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful: the creatures, the landslides, the uniforms...one of the best CLAMP artworks. The soundrack is just brillaint, really matchs the scenes, and the animation by Productions I.G. is amazing as always.\\n",

            "content": "One word: Disappointing. \r\nBoth the predecessors of this anime were phenomenal, dark pieces of work that knew how to grip its audience. Blood C did not know what it was doing with itself. \r\nIt tried to mix multiple genres into the original action/ gore of the original franchise. It was almost as if they wanted to confuse the audience by incorporating slice of life and romance tropes into the story on purpose but it was not done successfully at all. \r\nAt the same time as trying to mix genres that should not go together the world that informed audience members were familiar with was expandedto introduce ridiculous characters with even more ridiculous names. I mean, come on, one was just a giant eyeball. They were certainly a downgrade on the terrifying Chiropteran's in the original film and Blood+. \\n\\n\r\nThe art work used was too light and resembled a comedy series which just made the dark themes impossible to fully appreciate. \\n\\n\r\nSaya as a character has been one of my personal favourites since I was eleven years old but I just hated her in this. She was utterly useless in every situation and had little character development despite there being plenty of chances. She did not question anything and trusted too easily. Even amnesiac Saya of Blood + knew there was something off from the beginning. Blood C left me praying to every deity every created she would stop singing. \\n\\n\r\nSo disappointed that this sequel to one of my all time favourite animes was only a jumble of unexplained plot twists, unneeded fights and useless characters.",

            "content": "The first thing I'd like to get out of the way is the fact that this is the first of the Blood franchise/series that I've actually experienced, so I have no actual knowledge of what's been done in Blood+ or Blood: The Last Vampire. \r\nThe story of Blood-C was, from my perspective, well written. Very intricate and intriguing; by the end of the show itself mind you. I notice that most people who watch this show tend to complain about how obscurely the show conveys the story. This isn't untrue, for the first good chunk of the show (five to six episodes or so). Eachepisode for this 'chunk' maintains a fairly rinse-and-repeat formula: The main character sings her way to her high school life for the first 16 minutes, and then proceeds to have a well-animated battle with a single demon for the remainder of the episode. However, after that certain point in the show, the show begins to reveal important facts relative to the ultimate story. Eventually, the I was able to piece together the plot given to them into something that actually makes some sort of sense. Finally, when the show was over, I didn't find myself confused too much. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR The story isn't confusing by the time you finish the show, but it takes a while to take off in terms of actual plot. The few twists the show threw at me managed to surprise me legitimately and ultimately revealed an entirely new perspective on the show itself which is further touched upon in the movie Blood-C: The Last Dark.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very aesthetically pleasing, and the battle animation is smooth or crisp when it needs to be. The animation has that signature I.G. effect that I'm quite fond of myself. The animation isn't anything outstanding, but it was still enjoyable nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is one of the weaker points this show is equipped with. Aside from the memorable opening and ending themes, the show doesn't exactly have any other boast-worthy soundtracks. It's highly probable that I could recall one or two songs that were repeated every episode: One for when Saya walks to school and another for when she has her \"battle of the episode.\"\\n\\n\r\nMost of the cast started off as characters who lacked that unique touch that I generally look for in anime, however, there are a few characters whom I found much depth towards the ending portion of the show. Aside from the main antagonist, only a select few other characters managed to capture my interest during the run of the show. Each character in the show has their fair share of layers that are gradually revealed and developed over the course of the show. However, the most interesting developments happen to be for the main character and antagonist. For spoiler reasons, I'll refrain from going into too much detail. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the show very much; and the experience was made even more of an impact with the addition of the movie. While watching the ending of the show as a whole, I had thought that the show had just left me on a major cliffhanger, but that opinion quickly changed after I had finished the movie sequel. The battle animation was pleasant and felt exciting to watch, the action was intriguing and had me on the edge of my seat for the majority of the battles. The characters aren't necessarily boring, instead, they gradually evolve over the course of the show from one stereotype into a completely unique and new person altogether. The story was very fascinating by the time I had finished the show in its entirety, the movie in all. When I had finished the initial show at first, I had a set conclusion that I had come to regarding the plot. However, when I had finished the movie, that conclusion had completely been negated and a new perspective on the story was revealed to me. \\n\\n\r\nI'd recommend this show to someone who's interested in a show mainly focused around the fanservice of great battle animation, because realistically the strong and powerful battles are the show's strongest points. If you're looking for a story that impacts you heavily, this show will be a gamble for you. The story isn't weak, but I can definitely see how someone's expectations would fall short. The characters may appear annoying or generic at first, however they evolve over time. If you're someone looking for loveable characters, I wouldn't look to this anime. \\n\\n\r\nPros\\n\r\n-Great animation, specifically for the battle scenes\\n\r\n-An intricate story and plot in the grand scheme of the show\\n\r\n-The twists plot are generally unpredictable for the most part\\n\r\n-A great conclusion with the addition of the movie\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n-The story does take a fair amount of time (Around five or six episodes) to pick up\\n\r\n-Each episode is rather empty for the beginning chunk of the show, mainly consisting of a slice of life sequence and a battle sequence\\n\r\n-For impatient viewers, the show can seem slow at some times",

            "content": "Ugh. I wanted to like this seeing as it was a spin-off to one of my favorite animes of all time (Blood+ as well was Blood: The Last Vampire) but couldn't. Sucks because it actually had some potential to be decent too.\r\nFirst, Saya's personality makes her one of the most unlikable female protagonists in any action anime I've ever watched. She's a total airhead. A shy, clumsy (yet somehow a master with her sword), awkward girl with glasses.. it just doesn't fit the \"hero\" role or whatever role they were trying to make her at all. Also, so much animation time, especially in the firstfew episodes, is wasted with her just running from place to place, tripping and falling or walking around singing for like 30 seconds sometimes (which is cringe worthy annoying, I almost dropped it right there the first time I heard her sing). All of this time could've been put to better use maybe by developing the other characters since none of them were memorable at all. \\n\\n\r\nAfter the first episode my only thoughts were \"well.. at least the ending theme is good\". I figured since it was only 12 episodes I could just tolerate it and maybe it will get better and while it sort of redeems itself in the last few episodes by throwing a plot twist to everything, I didn't feel satisfied enough for being bored to death during the first half because of how slow the pacing was. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the good, well the art is nice. Character drawings are pretty and the fighting scenes are well animated. The horror aspect is also very present during the monster scenes along with plenty of gore but maybe too much at times. When you stab someone with a sword you wouldn't expect blood to gush out like you just opened a fire hydrant. Those are really the only appealing things about the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't care at all about the story, like seeing people get senselessly cut up, disfigured, eaten and you haven't seen anything better to compare this series to you might like it, but even then I would say just watch a compilation of the death scenes on youtube to get the same shock value and save yourself the time because this really is the longest 12 episodes I've ever watched. But if you'd like to see a much better anime with a similar concept of a girl slaying monsters and slowly uncovering her forgotten past executed and paced much better seriously go watch Blood+.",

            "content": "Well. Wow. \r\nThis is on the level of ... Terra Formars (also known as \"Cockroach Death-o-Rama\").  Actually, it is even worse. Didn't think it was possible.\r\nBasically, this is an anime with okayish visuals, a few very, VERY nice fight scenes, decent music, and absolutely abominable story and characters. I'm not sure what happened to CLAMP and producers of this anime, but this is junk with no redeemable qualities. The few nice fight scenes are completely outweighed by the garbage anime pulls off afterwards.\r\nStory: 2/10.\r\nThe idea was apparently to make a mystery, start with a lighthearted daily life scenes, slowly make the story go darkerand darker, then make shocking revelation, except that none of this worked. The \"cheerful daily life\" part is so cliched that it is completely unbelievable. The \"darker and darker\" amounts to throwing an endless stream of Diabolus ex machinas and \"Break the Cutie\" episods at the viewer. There's so much gore that it is not shocking but simply annoying. Also... the hints are so obvious that shocking revelations could be predicted several episodes ahead of time. (Somebody did too much hinting. Way too much hinting. The \"subtleness of sledgehammer\" kind of hinting). \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10:\\n\r\nNice, detailed backgrounds. Detailed characters... with proportions similar to the \"noodle people\" from XXX holic. It is not quite \"noodle people\", but I think characters are at least 8 heights tall. There are few very amazing and fluid animation scenes, but the number of those is small. Animation in general is quite fluid, but in action scenes it lacks shading, and enemies are quite flat. Also, every thing killed in the anime has metric ton of pressurized blood, meaning they all go \"pssshhhhh!\" when sliced in half. This gets annoying.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10: \\n\r\nThe main theme is very nice and interesting and is close to something I'd listen to. Some of the combat music is quite good as well. Voice acting does not stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10:\\n\r\nWatching character interaction is pretty much painful. There are no likeable and no believable characters. All interactions are stereotypical, and people act in completely insane fashion. It is on \"Someone got horribly killed in front of our eyes! Let's have a funny chat and blush\". Ridiculous. Everybody is either some sort of stereotype or a carton cutout (filled with pressurized blood). There are also many situatiosn when somebody patiently waits till someone gets killed. Very patiently. Sigh.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10:\\n\r\nWell, I loved the fight in the first episode - that was amazingly done. However, past that point the anime kept going downhill becoming worse and worse  after every episode. The overuse of \"Diabolus Ex Machina\" trope. The wooden horrible interactions. Heroine being an airhead that is dumb as a brick. Predictable events. And bland scenes where somebody startes at someone else with completely dead eyes. By the episode 10 I hated it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10:\\n\\n\r\nThis is junk. If you want to see what good this anime has to offer... watch the second half of the first episode, it has a very well done fight in it. It is pretty much the only one such fight in the series, following ones are less interesting. And then listen to the main theem on youtube or something. Then skip the rest of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEven without being part of the \"blood\" franchise, this is junk - because gore alone is neither shocking or interesting enough.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the best idea is to skip it.",

Very good plot development, keeps you off-balance then leaves you completely  devastated at the end.  I definitely empathized with and cared about Saya as a character throughout.\r\nSeveral days after watching, Iam still thinking about this anime, so it had left an indelible, disturbing impression, a question, which I could not shake, until I realized what it is that, for me, is the central idea that makes this story interesting.  (I don't think this will be much of a spoiler, but it may be.) The only characters that tell anything resembling the truth are the bloodthirsty monsters.  \\n",

            "content": "Everyone I've seen review this series compares it to others in the Blood line (ha), but I'd rather take it from a separate angle. I watched the series as it came out (thank you Internet), but unfortunately, it was censored. So all the lovely gore that I was looking forward to was a bunch of bright lights and mosaics. Please take that into consideration.\r\nStory (5): Well the pace of the story starts of balls slow, which is intended I'm guessing, but I feel like some people were looking for a more fast-paced intro. When they didn't get it, they disliked it. So if you're startingoff this series, be a little patient, it will pick up. I found it to be predictable, but still thoughtful enough to keep watching. However, I think plot could have been more developed.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9): What can I say? CLAMP's art style makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. Shoujo-esque characters, and then you have the more gruesome side to it with the \"monsters\". It flowed very well, and from what I could see that wasn't blurred out, it was well detailed. It was a nice contrast as well to the bloodsplosions and gore. If you're looking for an art style more rough around the edges, this might not be what you're looking for, but give it a shot anyway.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8): Aside fromt he OP and ED (which were lovely) the rest of the music during the show was quite nice. Or at some points, lack thereof. It balanced out the scenes well, and I wouldn't mind listening to the soundtrack outside of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (3): I was honestly expecting more out of this series in terms of characterization. Sure, there were twists to characters, but most of them were fairly obvious, and I didn't really sense any development...perhaps aside from some moments with Saya. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6): I can say that I did enjoy this series, up until the last two episodes. It was good fun to watch, and I might actually watch it again (uncensored of course). I looked forward to the new episodes coming out weekly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6): Well I've seen better series, and I've seen much worse. The artistic aspect I think balanced out the lack of character development and story. My advice is to take Blood -C very much separately from Blood+ etc, and I feel like you'll like it for the most part. Take it for what it is.",

            "content": "Well, this is my first review, just to say this first. I'll write my true feelings about this show.\r\nI don't know why I write my first review about Blood-C, but I had just a feeling I should write one when I watched the last episode. Okay let's start.\r\nTo be honest I can't say I liked it and I can't say I disliked it either. I've seen neither Blood: The last Vampire nor Blood+ so I wasn't prepared for what might come. It was ... bloody. That's the only thing I can say about it, if you ask me to discribe Blood-C with only one word.\\n\\n\r\nComing to the story. It was kinda complicated for me, since the real thing came really late. The meaning of everything what happened. I think it was not fully explained, so I hope it will in the movie. At first it was all sunny, fluffy and nice with a bloody red aftertaste. Then it turned more and more red with sorrow and death.\\n\r\nThe motto in this show, at least for Saya was \"I will protect everyone\", but it was quite the opposite what happened. I think if you take the story, this was really good. If you take the feelings that come out of this, it's just sad and frustrating. Someone can easily imagine what Saya felt. And I think that's an important part of a story. So I'll give it at least a 7.\\n\\n\r\nNow the art. I think it was good, nothing much to say about it. Get's a 8. \\n\\n\r\nSound. Well I didn't have many anime which sound was bad. So this one is an anime with great sound just like many others. The sound suited the scenes perfektly and I personally liked the dramatic one. The Seiyuu cast was a great choice just as always (imo). Deserves a 9.\\n\\n\r\nNow characters. Well it was dissapointing. Since at first everyone seemed very symapthic to me, later it turned out to be a total farce. Characters I liked turned out to be assholes (excuse me :x), but well that is part of the story, and since it makes the characters the way they are (unfortunately), it's good. I think I shouldn't rate characters low, just because I don't like them. I should judge about how they suit the story and how they act. \\n\r\nNow for the character design. It was not as much CLAMP as other series of their manga for example. I don't really like the character design of CLAMP, but since it wasn't this extreme, I liked it very much. Overall it get's a 8.\\n\\n\r\nNow the most important part imo. The enjoyment of this anime. I did NOT enjoy it. I found it interesting. I found the morals, persons and how the show would progress interesting. Note that it is not the same as enjoyment. I give it a 2.\\n\r\nSince I don't enjoy bloodshed, especially not this much and I don't enjoy massacres. Though I thought some specific characters deserved it at the end. I cryed about only one death. Especially the extreme massacre at the end was the worst of all and if it would've been at the start I would've dropped it right away.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think it wasn't a bad anime, but it wasn't very good either. It was just bloody, but it had an interesting story. I look forward to the movie. But I hope those massacres won't continue. I would prefer it to have more story, since much has to be cleared.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

The reason I started this anime was because of Blood+ so I went with high expectations, but then\u2026 Boom! Disappointment started.\r\nThe story in general felt really bland, I\u2019m glad that there were only 12 episodes because the pacing was horrible and it felt repetitive with the monster-of-the-week episodes, and the characters that were so boring! Everytime Tadayoshi appearedI wanted to sleep because all he did was to say \u201cSaya\u2026\u201d like all the time, god. Although I did find the twist at the end nice, I knew Fumito was involved in some sense, but I never could have guessed what was really going on, so kudos for that.\\n\\n\r\nAlso I found that some of the monsters were ok and originals, but others lmao were just utterly ridiculous, and there\u2019s really just one who made an impression on me and was actually scary, the spider-like that appeared in episodes 8-9, that one made me shiver and I felt uncomfortable.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, if you're into gore then this anime is for you, because honestly Blood-c is one of the most violent and gorey animes I\u2019ve ever seen, I mean that final episode\u2026 I cringed so much in the final scenes, I was seriously disturbed by the violence, and this is coming from a person who has seen a lot of gorey animes.\\n\r\nBut overall, was BLEH. I feel like it totally ruined the Blood franchise and people should just stick with Blood+ to be honest, there you have an amazing Saya and also let's not forget Haji :)\\n",

I was a big fan of Blood: The Last Vampire and Blood+ and I was really hyped up for this show. That was until I watched the first three episodes. It was just so boring I couldn't take it any more. The story is nothing special. I thought that the fighting could save this show in my books but the fighting was boring too. The only good thing about this show is the art. Try it out for you self, just don't expect anything special. This showis by far the worst of Blood: The Last Vampire and Blood+.",

Which still remains accurate after finishing the series. Though the battle scenes where entertaining the show fell extremely flat. The plot reminded me of Cabin in the Woods. The pacing was incredibly slow, they could have made a movie out of this 12 episode anime and the movie would have gotten the same points across. The lore between Blood+ and Blood-C does not connect by any stretch, and I honestly believe that Blood-C might as well be it's ownshow. I could elaborate but that would risk going on into spoiler territory. Overall it is disappointing, and I wouldn't watch it again.",

            "content": "This is the only anime I've ever watched that actually managed to make me legitimately mad that I watched it. Save yourself 4 thankless hours and just watch the last episode. It will make the same amount of sense anyway, and all of the events will be just as thankless. Every episode, except for the last few is 20 minutes of nothing that tries (and fails) to get you attached to the characters, followed by a four minute fight that's mediocre at best. Everything's leading up to a couple of plot twists that you probably won't care about because you're sick of the characters, alreadyknew who the bad guy is, and the one thing that the things keep hinting at isn't that big a deal. I swear to god, ten minutes of each episode is dedicated to her singing that annoying song. It's not even a song, she's just narrating her life.\\n\r\nTo summarize, the plot twists come to fast, to early, and without any reason for you to care, the plot develops too slowly until it doesn't, the characters are trash, but it tries to make you relate to them, the gore and fights are like 2% of the whole thing, the monsters are overly complicated and, except for the bunnies, look terrible (seriously, if all of the monsters looked like the bunnies do, I'd give art a 10 and overall a 3 or 4), whenever anything happens to a character it's right after the story establishes that everything you've known about them is a lie, and it just drags on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and",

            "content": "Blood C follows high school student Kisaragi Saya, who is not all that she seems. By day, she is a cheerful, ditzy, and well-mannered girl devoted to her father and her friend Nanahara at the village\u2019s coffee caf\u00e9. By night, she is a fearless and superhuman fighter with an enchanted sword that lets her kill monsters called Elder Bairns. As Saya fights these monsters, she starts to learn more about herself and her world, and the life she knows begins to crumble. Blood C is a twelve episode series that aired in 2011. It was based on the manga illustrated by Ranmaru Kotone and producedby Studio Production I.G. and CLAMP. It is a dark fantasy/supernatural/mystery/horror genre show that can also be considered a psychological thriller. \\n\\n\r\nBlood C's story is very well written and executed, starting out as subtle, and slowly giving you more hints of the truth with each episode. Those who are not used to the genre and not good at picking up clues may find it difficult to see an overarching plot at first. Such viewers may only seeing the obvious things: clumsy girl at school each day, brutal monster fighter each night. The atmosphere of the show quickly gives it away as having an element of mystery and dark twists, however, to anyone familiar with the genre. Blood C is a great anime for making you think, and if you pick up on the clues, you will probably find the answer like I did just an episode or two before the big reveal. \\n\\n\r\nAs a writer, I'm always interested in story structure, and Blood C used an outline that I like a lot in short novels and 10-12 episode series. Episodes one through three establish the setting, the characters, and the picture of how life \"should be\" in this world. At the same time, this beginning arc leaves information gaps that force viewers to wonder what is really happening. The rising action culminates with plot point one (the first major hint given) at the end of the third episode. The second major development occurs in the fifth and sixth episodes. Episodes seven to nine form the next part of the story, ending in the defeat of a major monster and the feeling of Saya's world coming to an end. Episode ten serves as the buildup for the final two episodes, wherein everything comes to light. This story form is extremely well suited for twelve episode series and is used in many anime, including Madoka Magica. \\n\\n\r\nI am not an artist and I cannot provide terribly well-informed reviews of art. All I can say is that I loved the animation style and was impressed with it. I thought the colors, character designs, action sequences, and scenery were all good enough, though nothing spectacular. Some viewers don't like the art style and describe it as having \"lanky\" characters. As for me, I get tired of seeing one style all the time, so I love animators that deviate from the norm. It looks like a lot of thought went into the creation of each monster, so I enjoyed seeing them. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in Blood C caught my attention and significantly contributed to my enjoyment of the anime. After all, music is one of the most crucial tools in building up suspense, portraying horror, and giving a mysterious atmosphere. The main recurring theme in the score does not have a name that I am aware of, but the OST track 1 \"Destiny\" features a fast-paced, thrilling version of the melody that appears throughout the anime. There are creepy scores as well as upbeat ones like \"Cafe Guimauve\" and soft, touching tunes like \"Yakusoku.\" The opening song isn't my favorite but the ending song, \"Junketsu Paradox,\" is great. \\n\\n\r\nThere wasn't a lot of detailed characterization in Blood C, and although they are someone what one-dimensional, I find the characters unforgettable. This is especially true if you watch it to the end, since certain aspects of the characters are not shown until the second to last episode. Although you can probably find out who the villain is once you get about halfway through, the villain's goals or reasons for his actions are never made exactly clear, which is one of this anime's shortcomings. The character of Saya herself, however, is very interesting from the start, prompting viewers to ask questions. Why is she so devoted to her father and the shrine? How is she strong-hearted enough to get through those fights when she seems so airheaded at school? Is there a reason she can't seem to look at her surrounding world with a clear, objective view? Finally, I loved the character of the dog, who is never named in the anime. He provides some moe and some occasional comic relief. \\n\\n\r\nThere are many specific things about Blood C that I enjoyed and wanted to comment on, but virtually all of them would be spoilers. Personal enjoyment is my most important measure in rating anime, and I give Blood C a nine out of ten.\\n",

            "content": "Alright, I know as of right now this anime is on the list of the most hated anime to ever share the same name as another, but here's the break-down. You either really like it or absolutely despise it. With this show, there is no in-between.\r\nIf you don't already know the ending to this series, you should be glad that I will not be spoiling any piece of it in my review. If anything, I'm going to be very vague. All warnings aside, let's get to it.\r\nStory: The best thing I can say is to stick with it. After you break through the first fewepisodes, it becomes a helluva lot more entertaining. Anything past episode 10 is completely out-of-bounds in terms of fair game. Until then; you have to sit through 3 pretty boring episodes, 3 really exciting episodes, 4 confusing episodes and then the final 2. Let me bring you an idea for why they chose to go with this angle for each section (excluding episodes 11 and 12, you'll know why).\\n\r\nFirst 3: This portion serves as a deconstruction of the moe slice-of-life bullshit that has been spewed at everyone for the past few years. Satirical and overloading the gore on purpose, this part exists to show how disgusted everyone is with moe anime.\\n\r\n4-6: This is where it really starts to form itself. If you've stayed with it long enough for the story to show itself to you, then you're in luck. These are probably the most intense episodes (aside from 11 & 12, we'll get to you though). Builds up the characters for really good action shots.\\n\r\n7-10: Not gonna lie, these episodes were really confusing. If you don't pay ultimate attention to these episodes, then you're going to be absolutely raped by the next part. Keep up with these episodes, don't lose focus and they'll be nice to you.\\n\r\nFinal 2: (Expertly avoiding spoilers) These are the biggest questions everyone answers. Watch and you'll know why.\\n\r\nOverall, the story doesn't really shine for a few episodes and by then most people had dropped it like a fucking rock. If you want a really good story, then try your best to make it through 1-3 and you'll be smooth sailing all the way to episode 11. If episodes 1-3 hadn't been as they were, the story could've been an easy 9, but it drags it down to a 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Character: These are basically one and the same. If they weren't, then what would you look at? CLAMP knew exactly what they were doing with this show. The character designs stayed pretty normal, and the art/animation wasn't anything to spit water at...yet. However, by the end of episode 1, you see where MOST of the budget went. And that's the fight scenes. Sleek and beautiful, these areas of the show could be watched only and you'd still have a fun time! You never get tired of them, they're always so well done.\\n\r\n9/10 on the art, but the character designs are a little boring overall, aside from Saya. 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Whoever did the soundtrack needs a pat on the back. The disgustingly sweet moe sounds for the slice-of-life portions, the super suspenseful sounds for the fights, and the fights themselves. Those are brilliant. The VA work for both sub and dub is phenomenal. The raw emotions are perfect well executed. The OP and ED are beautiful. Easily, the best parts of Blood-C are the OP and ED. Beautiful songs mixed with good backgrounds or perfect animation show that a lot of thought went into this. Overall, the sound part gets a perfect 10.\\n\\n\r\nI personally adore this show. One of my finer choices when it came to Limited Edition purchases, and I'm glad I chose Blood-C over We Without Wings. I have not seen Blood-C: The Last Dark as of yet, but I play on it someday. My overall feeling for this show: 9/10. The characters are a little lacking (for reasons) and the story doesn't really get going until episode 4, but overall, the entire show deserves more love than the hate. Blood+ fuckbois need to get over the fact that this show wasn't what they were expecting. Whether they expected it to be good is beyond me, but I expected a dumpster fire and my expectations were exceeded.\\n",

            "content": "I'm gonna start off and say I have not seen anything else in this series or franchise or whatever, so I'm not gonna make any comparisons. What I will say is that I did overall enjoy Blood C. It was gory, action packed and I actually think it was a decent show. \r\nNow I'm gonna say that Saya is an odd character. She goes from sweet ditzy schoolgirl to badass monster killer at the drop of a hat, and it honestly seems like they are two very different people. Saya is super cute, and her desire to protect everyone is rather endearing, while not beingentirely annoying. Badass Saya is kind of cold hearted, and I wish I saw more of her backstory and personality. She kind of reminds me of Moka Akashiya from Rosario+Vampire actually.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters like her various friends at school manage to not detract from the series. They get just enough airtime that I don't find the 'filler' to really be filler. They show the juxtaposition between normal saya and her bizarrely bland and sheltered life with badass Saya who can kill a monster with one blow. \\n\\n\r\nHer father and the shop owner do keep me from being completely lulled by her boring day life. They manage to be somewhat unsettling in how they treat her, especially in how they speak to her. I'm not going to get into it however.\\n\\n\r\nThings I didn't like were probably the annoying censorship that was super inconsistent and obvious. You see blood in one shot, but they just add the most glaringly obvious white or black bar in another. It kind of defeats its purpose because you still see the gory details anyway since they don't keep the bar up. I dunno, that was real stupid to me. \\n\\n\r\nSometimes the music also did not fit the mood of a scene, and that made scenes feel weird and wrong for no reason. It wasn't the whole series, but some in the beginning especially were like that. \\n\\n\r\nIn general I am really liking this series. I mean characters and storyline are decent, and I did enjoy the fight scenes a lot. I will say that if you like action at every given moment, this will probably not be for you as there is a decent amount of time spent with her at school and doing mundane things. This is important to the plot though, so I still recommend you watch it. Hope this helps\\n\\n\r\n-SK\\n",

It has Purpose!!!\r\nI really recommend watching it. I think it's a 10/10 anime.\r\n10/10 in all areas apart from 'Enjoyment'... Because this anime is not supposed to be enjoyed.

            "content": "To put it simply for a large portion of the series there is no story to speak of outside of the premise you can find here but it's just that a premise it's not a story a story has a beginning , a middle and an end this doesn't have any of those until the final two episodes by which point its two little two late .\r\nI have to say that i'm a fan of a few of these actors and heck alot of them are anime legends so is it any surprise that they turn in a great performance in my opinion all ofthe characters in this show are cast perfectly but I do have some bias because i'm more familiar with the dub.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is the third entry into the Blood franchise with the other two being Blood The Last Vampire , Blood+ and the live action version of Blood The Last Vampire. I'm just going to be straight forward outside of the live action Last Vampire movie so I can't say if this is better then any of those entries I can however say it's better then the live action version of Last Vampire tho and I am a big fan of this version of the franchise.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is a co-production between female manga group CLAMP who are the team behind the hit series xxxHolic and Production I.G who worked on the world famous Ghost In The Shell. The animation is done by Production I.G and if you've seen of there work regardless of what series it is then you'll know that they always do top notch animation. In my opinion tho the animation in this show isn't the companies best don't get me wrong it's really good but tho there are alot of times where the animation just looks cheap and poorly done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that there is a fairly solid twist that happens near the end of the series i'm not going to spoiler what it is but I will say that you'll want to keep an eye of Saya's friends. For me this twist works because it's something that you don't see coming and that's what a great twist should be like it should be something that you don't see coming and this twist actually has an impact on the plot of the show as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI have to talk about our main character Saya even tho she is indeed a bada*s she also has the personality of a piece of paper. I'm not even kidding there's nothing to this character outside of the fact that she fights monsters and is sometimes late for school which lets be honest that last point is typical anime lead character but there's nothing that defines her as a character she's just a bland hero and that's a shame because she's the person we're meant to be rooting for so you'd think that the creative team would put some effort into giving her this thing called a personality.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNot only is there a great plot twist there's also a twist on who the villain of the show is and unlike the first twist the shows does leave a few clues here and there as to who the villain of the show is. I will grant people this there not big clues all they'll do is show the villain from behind but it's still something because then you have something to go of and the episodes dealing with those reveals are honestly some of the best that the show has to offer.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSomething which I kind of noticed and it's the oddest thing but if there's a girl and she happens to be someone who's going to make it to the end then chances are there going to have a large chest. Now granted this isn't true for the twins but for the vast majority they have large boobs and a few of them make it out of the series alive surely I cannot be the only one who's noticed this please tell me there's someone else as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn my personal opinion I think that the series is one long prequel to the movie since the Saya we meet in the movie is alot different from the one that we meet at the start of this series. If that is the case which given that the two were produced at the same time it very well could be then it seems weird to me that there would be hours of prolog just for one two hour movie if anything it would have made sense for the movie to have a separate storyline and for the anime to have two seasons.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow it is said that this version of the Blood franchise takes in the same world as xxxHolic because the character of Dog is meant to be another character from xxxHolic and they even have the same voice actors. I will say tho that's as far as the connection really goes they don't outright say that the two exist in the same world be merely make a suggestion that they do and for that works because i've never seen xxxHolic and given how many anime series that franchise has i'm not going to anytime soon.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is a horror anime so that means that we have to talk about the horror aspects of the show in terms of scares simply out there's nothing that scary well I say that but if you've not seen that many horror films then you might find this series scary but if you've seen alot of horror films and shows then your not going to be scared by this show. There is however alot of gore and when I say alot I mean alot like the people in this show must be filled with alot of blood because when they get ripped open alot of it comes gushing out and while it can be awesome it does get a bit boring after a while.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall this isn't a bad series but it does have alot of problems mostly because for alot of the series run it feels like an average episode of Power Rangers in that the villain sends a monster to attack our main hero every week which is what the villain of this show does every episode but it's also an entertaining series so it gets a 6 out of 10 from me.",

I can see where it's a series that you can love or hate.\r\nThe story was good but I wanted to see some background on how this experiment was conceived (maybe the movie will answer that question).   I also wished they gave more back story to some of the characters.  I liked how the story had some twists to keep me guessing.   The characters were developed but I think there was room for even more development.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as art goes, I really enjoyed that aspect.   I like quite a few series from Clamp and was initially surprised that they would do a series like this. Even when it got violent and bloody, the artwork was still great.  Even the music was good, 'Spiral' was a great opening as well.  \\n\\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of really bloody shows but this is one of a few that I liked watching.  It was slow at first but as it proceeded further the pace picked up and it was the perfect speed.  I can't compare Blood+ and this show since the only connection I could see was that the protagonist was named Saya.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you like blood, this maybe a show you could watch.

            "content": "I watched this series because I happened upon it and the picture looked cool. I finished it and then went of myanimelist to see if there was a sequel. While looking I noticed that the reviews were really low. The show got a 6.71 overall and normally I won't even watch a show if the score is under 7.5 or so. That was when I realized that a disproportionate number of viewers probably watched the first few episodes and gave up. That sucks because, as I have discovered, there aren't that many truly engaging anime out there and unless one is a big fan ofridiculous looking giant robots, the list gets narrowed down pretty quickly.\\n\\n\r\nYes the first few episodes are pretty bad. The story doesn't exist and the contrast between normal time and monster fighting time is ridiculous. That said there is actually a reason for this but the reason doesn't really matter so if you are having trouble dealing with the first few episodes then skip to episode 6 or if you're a real extremist just start at 10 because that is where the plot really picks up.\\n\\n\r\nI know that I'm supposed to review all the aspects in order but most of them don't matter. Sound is fine. I never watch the intro or closing sequences so I could honestly care less about what they sound like. The characters neither add nor detract from the story because they don't really exist. Until the massive plot twist at the end. Even then they still don't really matter all that much. \\n\\n\r\nThe art deserves a mention because it is a little weird. Imagine that you are torturing someone made of rubber on a rack. Got it. Now imagine you stretch them way out. Well thats kind of what the characters look like. This doesn't bother me at all, and actually, after watching xxxholic, I have come to enjoy that style. The fight sequences are good and the animation was reasonably smooth. Good enough for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe most important rating here is the one for enjoyment. It doesn't matter what I or anyone thinks about individual parts as long as when they come together the parts form an entertaining whole, and they did. This show was good enough to have me search for a sequel and that means something because Im pretty picky about my anime. So before you ditch this show. GIve it a try at the very least I can promise lots of gratuitous blood.",

It would be at least somehow good if it was 24 episodes where the story can spread out more.\r\nPlot:\r\nLike most people expect from Blood-C is a plot that is somehow related to the plot of Blood +, but it isn't. Of course we have a inhuman samurai girl whom has an incredible power fighting these monsters called \"The Old Ones\", but from the looks of the first few episodes, its all just bunch of crap about the intros and stuff. Sure, a lot of us expect some more similiar things from Blood+ insteadthe plot was twisted into different ways in Blood-C.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWe have a girl named Saya whom seem to be different than the Saya in Blood+ except for the monsters and the power. She intends to be clueless and clumsy so I didn't came to liking her until she turned badass in the fights. The rest of the characters, the twins seem to be a bit annoying, but I ended up liking them for some reason. For the rest, I really don't care about them since they just seem useless including the twins.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWould I recommend Blood-C? Not really. Even through there is a lot of fighting and blood, I still wouldn't recommend it because of the plot and the characters. Sure, the anime has a good OP, but a boring ED. The anime could of been better if it was 24 or 25 episodes where we can understand the plot and the characters more. I would watch the uncensored version to bring up a better review to this, but I rather be lazy and not watch it until I feel like it. All I can say is only watch it once, watch the uncensored version then rage about the ending. For those who already watch the anime, I suggest you look foward for the movie. I know I would to see if it will change my opinion on the anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "B-b-back that ass up, it's time for a slammin' review. Do you remember that one time when you thought maybe your whole life was a conspiracy and everyone was just figments of your imagination or constructs of a cynical reality that you'd built up in your head? What, you mean you don't recall all those times where it felt like you were just on the cusp of realizing some greater truth before being pulled back into the mundane tedium that is day-to-day life? WELL GET READY TO FEEL THAT WAY, BECAUSE YOU'RE WATCHING BLOOD-C.\r\n1. THE STORY: Woah trick you better step off if you thinkyou know what's going on in this damn show. This isn't for entry-level weaboos, so if you don't understand rhetorical tools like genre inversion and narrative dissonance, go back to sucking your thumb and watching Dragon Ball Z or Doraemon or some shit. For real though, I don't expect some scrubs to appreciate the thickly woven narrative that is Blood-C. Basically, the plot of this shit is that Saya has to kill the monsters, which is the plot of every damn \"Blood\" anime so get used to that shit. However, due to the genre inversions and other tools at work, this show manages to be unique and fucking compelling. First of all, the show is done by CLAMP. Yeah, you know, the shitlords who make anime like XXXholic, Card Captor Sakura, and Chobits. Now, you might be like, \"Hold up I read that production IG--\" and here's where I'm gonna cut your ass off. CLAMP did the story and character designs and pretty much was in control of everything but the animation itself because I guess CLAMP is too busy making dojinshi or some shit. Anyway, the whole point is that you go into the show thinking that it's some typically moe CLAMP bullshit, but it turns out that's the furthest thing from the truth--and this is fucking compelling because it's true for the characters in the show too. HNNNG I get so damn hard just thinking of how well played that shit is. I'm not gonna spoil the plot, but it's a damn 10/10 due to perfect pacing, foreshadowing, development, and themes at work.\\n\\n\r\n2. THE ART: Look, I already covered why having CLAMP work on one of the most brutal titles ever is pretty much awesome, but there's a lot of shit going for this show in way of art. For instance, the agoraphobic and tense atmosphere that arises due to having such a colorful CLAMP town be fucking desolate is unsettling. Especially since it's like that in a load of anime, but it's given special attention here. Every time you start to take some typical bullshit anime approach to the art or direction of a scene, BLOOD-C kicks your damn teeth in for that shit and makes you hella noided. Now, I'm not gonna wax this bitch's shoes forever, because some of the fights are pretty slow paced, but that's just to accent the more fast paced ones. There's times when the animation is so damn fluid I want to tear my eyes out because goddamn I probably won't ever see anything more slick air on TV ever again. I HIGHLY STRESS getting the DVD or BLURAY version of this series, since they had to censor the Jesus out of it--and I mean, literally, Jesus shows up in one scene and you can't even see him in the TV version because of the pillar of light they put in to censor his lord and savior. On the real though, you'll miss monsters brutally destroying the face of everyone in a fifty mile radius, and that's pretty damn important to watch given the dichotomy I've explained earlier.\\n\\n\r\n3. SOUND: If that intro doesn't get you pumped to watch this show, nothing will. DESPAIR IS THE ONLY TRUTH YOU'VE GOT, BRO. Aside from that ass-kicking intro, there's also a pretty damn good soundtrack to go with this animation magnum opus from CLAMP and IG, but I don't even need to tell you to listen to it--just watch the damn show. So many times are unsettling tracks put alongside routine life that you start to feel that no one is comfortable living in this damn town. It's well done, because it establishes thematic elements at play without having to flat out tell you shit. If you're so dense that you don't get what's going on in the plot by episode 9, you probably need to wash the wax out your ears and turn up the sound, because the damn soundtrack brings you places you wouldn't go to otherwise.\\n\\n\r\n4. CHARACTER: Look, I'm not trying to spoil this shit, but the characters in this show are fuckin' perfectly done, given how it unfolds. Everyone's a seemingly flat anime bullshit stereotype and that's the damn point. The show itself parodies the state of the industry in its macabre dance of insane bloodshed and narrative dissonance. Within a twenty-minute setting, you'll be listening to Nana hum out the most kawaii~ tune, and also see the character she voices cut down a monster twice her size, covered in its blood, after it murders half a dozen people. This isn't the same shit as those other wannabe shows like Mirai Nikki or Higurashi--the juxtaposition of violence and cuteness is done tastefully and purposefully in this show and isn't just there for random hijinks.\\n\\n\r\n5. ENJOYMENT: Holy goose on the loose, I'd be lying if I say that this show doesn't get like a 15 for enjoyment. You'd have to dig up old fuckin' OVAs from the 90's to find something this brutal, and not to mention--there's so many clever and well played instances of foreshadowing that if you're scratching your head when big twists happen, you should be kicked in the dick. When the twists happen, the sensation is more akin to being slapped in the face by the same disembodied hand you've been staring at for the last three hours. Everything is there for you, and the show does an amazing job in its tedium and pacing to keep you involved and watching without giving up everything right away. The whole point is to not take things at face value, otherwise this'll just seem like a monster-of-the-week pandering show, which is exactly what the narrative itself defies in its existence. If you can't perceive narrative depth, then this isn't the fucking anime for you, but that's probably part of the creator's intent--to weed out the plebeians and reward the truly astute consumer of anime. In that regard, it is enjoyable in an entirely different way.\\n\\n\r\n6. OVERALL: Hot damn, BLOOD-C doesn't fail to impress. It's attractive in so many ways, just like that girl who lives down the street that everyone really likes but no one will admit and you'll just keep telling yourself she's just some average chick--but you know the damn truth, man. Don't just let BLOOD-C get old without you, ask her out and enjoy your damn time together, even if you know it's gonna end on a movie-setup cliffhanger. Who gives a damn? She's worth it.",

The final blew me away, how can a girl who just wants to fullfillher wish get shot in the head by her 'not so adorable cafe morning clerk'?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters [3/10] No character development untill the last episodes, they we're just there filling their task. Saya somehow doesn't show affection towards their friends who got killed, just gets mad and everything goes back to normal.\\n\\n\r\nStory [5/10] It was going fine until the very end where everything made no sense at all. I did like the gore but there were huge amounts of blood splashes, even when some monster just cut her leg a tiny bit there'd be coming blood out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nOST [9/10] The soundtrack was the only thing acceptable in this anime as I kinda've enjoyed the opening and the fight ost scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [4/10] The Inu was the only thing worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nStill, I do not recomend this anime to people who don't like gore things or bad structured stories. *sigh* Enough said.",

She will really show that she has split personality  because of  rapidly switching from of her terrifying face in fighting scenes and to this sweet innocent school girl. Its better if there's a connector.you know, the one that connects her two personality, this medium in her mind that will tellus why on earth she acts that way?!!!

Yeah, I might be at risk of getting eaten by terrifying monsters, but hopefully I'd be a character that will be able to kick ass. This anime heavily reminds me of Devil May Cry & Bayonetta, two game franchises that I have a personal love for. The actions scenes kept me gripped to my seat & had me saying: \"OMG\" repetitively. The amount of gore & violence in this anime kept me excited as I have a thing for graphic content in anime. The main character, Saya looks like the cutesylove child of Dante & Bayonetta, but she also seems like a cooler version of myself. She may be a kind, clumsy & helpful schoolgirl but she has the ability to f*ck up anyone who tries to hurt the people she cares about. I also loved how she always sang to herself about her day; I tend to sing a lot to myself as well. She is honestly one of my favorite anime characters of all time. The OST for this anime is also one of my favorite anime soundtracks next to Another's soundtrack. Whoever composed the music for this anime deserves an award.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 10 - 12 of Blood-C are getting so much sh!t from people it's scary. Don't get me wrong, I was quite baffled myself when I watched these episodes, but the thing about this anime is that it's meant to be a tragedy as well as an action, horror, & supernatural show. There's bound to be some shocking revelations about Saya & her past. However, I will say that these revelations were in my opinion a bit too shocking. It would've made sense if most of the revelations didn't choose to tug at my heart strings so harshly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall however, I highly recommend that you watch Blood-C. It's pretty awesome! :)",

            "content": "Extreme violence in dark action and horror shows is an ambivalent thing: \r\nThe integration of gore can create a certain tension by making you fear for your favourite characters not to end up being shred to bloody pieces. It can also underline a dark atmosphere, telling you that the environment the story takes place in is harsh, brutal and knows no mercy for people making mistakes. That is something we all know (or should know) from series like Berserk, BLAME! or (to mention animated material) Umineko. Of course, this terror-spreading bloodstained medal of gore has another side to it. Let's talk about Blood-C.\r\n- The Story:\r\nTobe honest, (although not being completely satisfying) Blood-C actually follows an interesting base frame considering the storyline. The story of innocent shrine maiden Kisaragi Saya, who is fighting against demons for the sake of her village, starts out as your typical monster of the week action show. This section is, looking back after seeing the whole picture, well made and pretty enjoyable. The action is exciting and Saya and her schoolmates are sympathetic and easy to get used to. While watching her slaying demons and handling her school life, there are always little hints, weird moments and mysterious lines that keep you on your guard for some bigger mystery behind the scenes to emerge sooner or later. The problem is, when that happens, rushed explanations and plot holes keep you from being satisfied. By then, it's already too late to save the show, anyway... More of that in the next paragraph.\\n\\n\r\n- The Atmosphere:\\n\r\nThe big problem of Blood-C is NOT the excessive depiction of gore and violence, but its purposelessness. Saya's battles with the demons often take their toll on casual bystanders. In the first episodes it is still shocking, to see what the demons are capable of, when Saya is too late to rescue someone from being devoured alive. \\n\r\nAfter a while, though, the attentive audience starts to wonder: \\n\r\n\"Well, she COULD have saved this poor bloke BEFORE he was turned into a bloody pulp, couldn't she?\" \\n\r\nAnd once you realized this, you'll start to ask yourself, if there maybe is a hidden purpose to this depiction of innocent people being gorged on (while the main heroine humbly waits for the monster to finish dinner), or... if this show is just about gore and brutality... for the sake of gore and brutality.\\n\r\nBy the end of the show, after seeing countless people being tormented to death without identifiable reason, you are so fed up with random violence that you don't care about explanations anymore.\\n\\n\r\n- The Design:\\n\r\nAs for the character design, there's not much to be said: It's CLAMP. Long, thin bodies with typically formed eyes and messed up proportions. You either hate it or like it. Looking at the design of the demons Saya has to face, most of them are designed rather well and have a unique feel to them. Regarding the quality of animation, although you get the feeling that some episodes use smaller budgets than others, most of the animation is done well and most of the fighting sequences feel dynamique.\\n\\n\r\n- Final Conclusion:\\n\r\nBefore realizing that most parts of the show emphasize violence for the sake of violence, Blood-C serves well as a typical dark monster-of-the-week action show with a mysterious subplot beneath it. The purposelessness of the extreme level of  depicted gore and the (for me) unsatisfying and rushed conclusion in the final episodes of the show corrupt what could have been an exciting and interesting dark action mystery experience.",

But really the story is really basic down to its bare bones it seems really lacking anything other than it seems we only got to some sort of summary and decided to copy and paste that for each episode. I was really disappointed when nothing interesting really happens for MOST of the anime. \r\nArt: 7 \r\nIt was nice the monsters looked scary and disgusting. everyone looked nice. the background wasn'treally that noticable most of the time\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nIt was generic I like the opening theme was nice. the start of the ending theme didn't really capture it right and the rest of it sounded generic. I actually watched some of this anime in dubbed and most of the time I watched it subbed. The most notable difference for me was that the voice of Saya sounded a bit more mature in the dubbed version compared to the voice of Saya in Japanese it was interesting but maybe it was because that was the first time I watched dubbed for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThe characters seemed to be really generic but I have a feeling that was intentional for reasons that would be explained in the anime\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nStory was bad they just keep on repeating the same thing as if they have a formula on how to write an episode for this anime that they decide to follow really badly. I just finished it so the enjoyment point is higher.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nIt was good I guess it would have been better if you cut most parts of the anime compressed to a movie length anime or 2. any way the ending made me feel that Blood-C was just a prologue for something greater.",

            "content": "There are shows that, because they are part of a great franchise, never get appreciated by what they are alone, but through the  already unrealistic expectations of being a much better settlement of the franchise's reference point. It's the case of Blood-C, having met a cruel and unfair depreciation because the Blood fanbase, who is responsible for watching and evaluating this show, are crazy in love with Blood+.  \r\nI haven't watched Blood+ and I couldn't care less about the Blood franchise either. Wether this is better or worse in my opinion doesn't have any relevance because as it stands alone I foundit to be a great great show. It is a bit different from other animes out there and I can probably figure why it fell from grace in such a horrible way. But I have to say one thing: Blood+ fanboys and fangirls, stop blaming the pacing! \\n\\n\r\n-About that pacing...-\\n\\n\r\nAll episodes are basically divided in two halves: the slice of life half and the gory half.\\n\r\nNow, that slice of life half was extremly boring for most people, I found it fascinating. Because this show just begs to differ. Any mystery show out there starts with blatant introduction of fishy characters, you know right from the start who is the good guy, who is the bad guy and who are the suspects. Well in Blood-C, the tension is bitter sweet because the boredom and silence and stillness that characterizes the characters and the surroundings are confusing as hell and they do a perfect job in creating the  so called \"silence before the storm\". Its is THIS feeling that makes this show great. Because it would have been easier to put tags on the bad guys and throw in a somewhat induced subjectivity, but if you really like mysteries and mindtwisting stuff this  is the right thing for you.\\n\\n\r\n-Art & Animation-\\n\\n\r\nNot very imrpessed on the art. I heard it's Clamp, but since i never liked Clamp I guess it's explainable. 7feet tall characters look deformed anyway, add to that an undersized head and you got... something ugly. And this thing with the heads happens in quite a few scenes and it's distracting as hell. Other than that, Clamp designs kind of lack... shadows and shine. And probably details also. Actually it's more like an unproportional distribution of details: we have graphic details in some places (like some useless hair bangs) but lack details on more important stuff - like the face. Animation on characters isn't too great either, they kind of lack expression and they are overall pretty stiff... lifeless. \\n\r\nBUT the gory fight scenes are awesome. Instead of using cheap \"shining blades\" tricks to draw attention from the actual moves, I think they did a pretty good job here. And it's not only about the way the animation was done, but the coreography was perfect also. Very enjoyable fights, cool moves and such, and, ofc, some blood pouring with quite some generosity here and there in a very \"organic\" way... not the silly \"blood spray\" things that we see in some other shows. What can I say... blood splashes are always nice :D\\n\\n\r\n-Sound- \\n\\n\r\nI liked the music. The symphonic type of music, I don't recall hearing any silly high school tune. It's teh kind of background music that has a great effect when associated with the dedicated scenes, it gives you shivers and scares you to death when people get beheaded, but you would never probably listen to it alone: losing it's context, the magic just fades away. But that is good because my winamp already has too many songs to scroll.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters+plot-\\n\\n\r\nWell to speak about these would require some spoilers so i'd rather not. Overall,  I found the characters okay, the strong point would be that they are uite enigmatic and it takes a while to figure out what they want and what they play. That is, in my book, a good thing because it helped me enjoy this piece. Saya however, I wouldn't be surprised if people would find her annoying. At least in the first half (the slice of life thing) because she is doing a lot of silly things and is very clumsy. Yeah right, like we haven't seen this kind of main playing the hero before.\\n\\n\r\nDo watch this. It's good. Forget about the other Blood stuff, don't compare to anything and just enjoy this as it is.",

It usually dawdles along, but sometimes switches to ultra-violence mode.  The overall effect is a cross between slice of life and mechanical problems in a red paint factory.  I kept thinking of God in Monty Python and the Holy Grail (\"Get on with it!\"). \r\nAs early as the third episode I was asking myself, \"why did she stand there watching whilethat guy went inside and got slashed to ribbons?\"  This continues throughout the show.  She just stands there and watches, even though she spends half her time going on about how she has to protect everyone.  After all the gushing finishes she finally decides it's time to start moving.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, the show is slow to start moving. By the time it does, the last episode is half over.  The result isn't uninteresting, but seriously, there really isn't any compelling reason to watch it.  \u2026 Unless you like red.",

I love the designs of both characters and the monsters.I like how each episode has a unique monster and how cold her father seems but I do admit the talking dog is over the edge. The story was lacking but I found this to be a pleasant time waster. It was amusing enough to keep me interested and yet it was simple. \r\nBUT! I noticed people who loved Blood+ loath this anime.\r\nSo it's safe to assume that if you love Blood+ this isn't the anime for you.\r\nJust walk away slowly and find something else.\r\nNow if your like meand enjoy watching anything that's a combination of soft core porn and mass amounts of gore(which is basically every horror movie out there) then you'll enjoy this.\\n\r\nOr if you have nothing better to do and your bored as hell.\\n\r\nJust don't take this anime seriously, go in with no expectations and you'll have a good time. But if you go in expecting glory and wonder then you ganna be as pissy as every reviewer on here.",

            "content": "[WARNING: If after reading this review you want to watch Blood-C, please bear in mind that this series can get quite gory and violent. Viewer Discretion is HIGHLY advised]\r\nWhen I saw the opening for this anime back in 2011 when it was announce, I just had to see this series for art appeal. I did not fully care if it was good or not, I just wanted to watch it on what I was saw in the OP and images. I hated Blood+. Disliked really, but it just wasn't that good. The whole basis of some major conspiracy as the hook in Blood+ was notat all intriguing and the action and gore was just disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nStep in Blood-C, a deceiving little anime that spends its time sitting there and being a generally generic bit and then BAM! Glorious gore! Beautiful blood! All sorts of violence happens in the series in some way, and the series never stops to top itself.\\n\\n\r\nSo let us get down and simple, what was good about this series? From the listing above my writing panel, we start with the Story. It's okay. It's not a mystery plot, it's a series written to make my primitive need to see violence be sated.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound was generally alright and well done. I can't complain all too much. Characters are basically designed by Clamp and as such have a Clamp aesthetic to them. Nothing much else to say.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to talk about Character, let us bring up the recurring character, Saya. In each Blood series, there is a character named Saya. All of them are sword wielding women who fight monsters that prey on mankind and the plot twist of who they are tends to be the same. Having not seen the original Blood: The Last Vampire, and never caring to, I can't say anything about that particular film. But when comparing the two Saya's between \"+\" and \"C\", C's Saya is just an all around better character on the simple note of an actual will to fight and be a total bad ass about it.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, what I remember about Blood+ goes about so: For most of the series (+)Saya is just generally unwilling and incapable of fighting until drinking Haji's blood. And even then, the fights she had just weren't memorable. And she was just downright bland really. I did not like her personality or design. She actually is not appealing even down to just how she looks. As I said, Blood+ was not particularly good on the action side, more so paying attention to a lackluster mystery. But at the same time, it's like the series was confused as to what it wanted to be in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nSo in Blood-C, the Saya we are introduced to is a happy-go-lucky, ditsy school girl who sings on her way to school. And then at night she turns into a badass monster hunter with a terrific fighting prowess. When she fights, she has the will to do so. When she fights, her fights have me just rooting for the next clash of her blade against the foe. Her character design is quite pretty as well, it was really what sold me on the series in the first place. Her appearance in the OP was just gorgeous. Especially near the end when it does a close up on her face. Those eyes man accompanied by those glasses just captures my heart.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I really enjoyed this series. I might be giving this a score in comparison to Blood+, and also a bias there of, but really, if I had to compare it to series like Hellsing, Black Lagoon, and the so forth, this pretty much whets my taste for action and violence. Be prepared to bring towels, a wetsuit, and many umbrellas though. It may as well be raining blood by the end of this series. And maybe limbs and organs depending on the episode.",

            "content": "This is a spoiler free review.\r\nBlood C is another story involving a tiny quaint town with a mystery where things start off happy-go-lucky and life couldn't get better but then suddenly gets disturbingly psychotic and messed up (which often-times make great animes). The main character is one of my favorites in terms of how she's drawn and her personallity. Saya is a very sweet, innocent, and carefree character who loves the little things in life. Her secret life, however, is a very dark one filled with the dutiful, secret task of wreaking blood and havoc upon monsters to keep the town safe. She is verywell drawn, very attractive with the black and red school uniform, the stockings, and the red ribbons laced through her hair. This show has a tiny bit of romance but I wouldn't consider it a romance anime at all. If you love stories that turn from carefree happiness and cuteness to utter despair and tragedy and a good mystery then this is the show for you. Be warned, you may have a lot of questions after, with maybe half of the mystery yet to be solved. There is a movie that takes place after the show but I have yet to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nPlease take a look at my favorite characters and watched animes and send me any recommendations please. I'm always looking for my next fix.",

Blood-C pissed me off to no end, but I just had to watch more...\r\nI read somewhere that someone said you must be masochistic to make it through the painful first episodes, and get to the end of this anime and still want to the movie, and maybe that person is right. Maybe I am masochistic?\r\nI HATED the anime SO MUCH, but for some reason, I want to watch it again in Blu-Ray quality with the blood FULLY uncensored,and I'm highly anticipating the upcoming, Blood-C Last Dark Movie this Summer. I look forward to the conclusion of this truly shit, bad excuse for a Blood series, no sarcasm.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThere is hardly a story, apart from some girl who lives in THE MOST FUCKED UP TOWN on Earth, and has THE MOST FUCKED UP friends ever. There were some \"seemingly\" nice people in that town, but by the end of the story, you'll hate everyone - even Saya herself, but... even though there's hardly any story, there is a story noneless, but is a good story? Yes. Will you like it? Probably not. (I did for some reason. lol)\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this series was a little lacking, but I loved the design for those bizarre school suits that they wore at Saya's school. It was nonetheless, decent... for a Production I.G anime.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe best freakin' part of the series! The opening is by far the best part of this series, and you'll probably only watch this series because you though, \"Wow, the opening's amazing! Surely the series is, right?\" Sadly... it's not, but the soundtrack is kick ass!\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThese had to be the most bland, boring and painfully sadistic bunch of characters I've ever seen in an anime - even more sadistic than the Higurashi cast, and you'll learn why by the end of this series, but unlike Higurashi, these characters have NO personality!\\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWow... This is hard to describe, but... It's like marmite... You either love it, or you hate it, and I didn't love nor hate this series, and even if I said, \"I fucking hate this piece of shit series,\" I'd still go back for more. Hahahaha...\\n\\n\r\n7/10 (for me)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis series was painfully disturbing, disappointing, and eye-gougingly gruesome, but the ending left me wanting more! More blood! More pain! More heartache, but the series sucks, so don't watch it... Unless you have BIZARRE taste! I for one must have.\\n\\n\r\n6/10",

Make sure to watch this while you are not eating anything (especially Pizza's) \r\nYou may not like this series in the first 3-4 episodes, I literally felt like dumping this anime in the middle, but i don't know what kept me going. The series is very horribly structured that is the main issue with this anime. \r\nThe character designs are pretty good, considering the double personality of Saya, it has been created in a very distinct manner. The demon side of her and the cute and kind personality ofher, other character design are fine as well, but since i am writing this in 2016, there is a great graphic difference, so don't expect the anime t be that great in visual designs. \\n\\n\r\nThe sounds are okay, okay. Not the best once again. I myself have downloaded the highest quality (8-Bit audio system) and watched it but then again, the sounds could have been better, the opening song is good as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is the main issue where it falls behind, or otherwise this anime would have an average of like 7-7.5 which would be really great. As i had mentioned before the story writer of the anime is not the best. In the middle of the anime is gets interesting and gives you the urge to keep on watching but at the end you would think to yourself why did i spend son much time watching this series. Yes trust me i had felt this as well. But if you are the kind of person that does not care about stupid endings then this is fine for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a good anime for a person, who has run out of animes to watch. So i don't highly recommend this anime to you, but if you want a change from all those \"Slice of Life Animes\" then this would be good for you. But get ready to face a lot of Gory, Sadness and Betrayl. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, I'll try to keep it as unbiased as I possibly can (Blood-C is one of my all time favourites). I rate pretty nicely so keep that in mind. \r\nDeciding whether you'll love this anime as much as I did or hate it depends on your mainly your tastes. So if you're a fan of psychological, gore, mystery, an underlying love/hate relationship, and a little school life then this is for you. If you don't like blood and gore then perhaps you should just walk away from this one. If you love revenge plots then you could consider this a buildup/prequel to the revenge plot of Blood-C: The Last Dark. \\n\r\nIt's a part of the Blood franchise but you don't necessarily have to have seen the previous series to enjoy Blood-C, I for one haven't seen any of the previous works. Keep an open mind and don't compare it so much to the rest, if you do then you might not enjoy it as much. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 8/10 - The storyline is basically your average psychological/mystery. As the story progresses it turns increasingly dark as you begin to gather pieces of the mystery through the protagonist Saya's mind. Although it's an average plot that doesn't mean that it can't be enjoyable. It is a short series so the plot isn't too complex and lacks detail that you'd have to hunt through the manga to find, and it is complex enough to keep you entertained episode by episode. However it does end at a cliffhanger so you'll have to watch the sequel movie Blood-C: The Last Dark. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10 - If you're a fan of CLAMP's animation style then you'll love Blood-C's animation. The animation was clean and crisp, and was never lazy. The character designs were cohesive with the apparent black and red colour scheme, and remained simple in a nice way. The backgrounds were beautiful as well. The blood and gore was very nicely done, and the gorey parts in beautiful detail as well. The fighting scenes were enjoyable and were complex and challenging enough for Saya that you'll stay entertained during every enemy battle Saya partakes in. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10 - This soundtrack was simply amazing. The cheerful and innocent music contrasting well with the dark and suspenseful music was a nice touch. It suited the show well, especially with how it played off of what Saya was feeling. The voice actors in Japanese were great, the English dub is also pretty good. In a sub vs dub debate I'd have to say sub, Saya's voice sounds more natural and the voice actress plays her part amazingly well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10 - The character development was mainly just that of Saya Kisaragi, the other characters didn't have much development. Saya's mind throughout the length of Blood-C was a heartbreaking place and her pain was clearly portrayed, you got to understand her at a nice level with the external conflict as well as her internal conflict. I found Saya to be very inspiring as well, she suffers quite a bit in the plot and yet always finds the strength to stand up and follow through with her plans (especially in the Last Dark sequel). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10 - I. Loved. It. It kept me on my toes. I knew nothing about Saya going in and so everything that was new to her was new to me. It will always remain a favourite of mine. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10",

It was quite dulll and boring I thought it would be interesting and I even skipped past the beginning episodes to get to the good parts and sadly I found none... Nothing is good about this anime in my eyes others will disagree and praise its name but I can only say terrible bad things about this anime... Its not the least bit interesting or entertaining I actually like blood trinity more than this and it wasnt even that great.... andboth aired around the same time and dealt with similar settings... this proabaly also had a factor in my dislike because I noticed how inferior it was to another show similar in design. Blood C is great if you like anime about characters with no real personality and no real feelings towards any characters  Blood C was emotionless to me and felt like a basic shoen anime like naurto with no real threat to any major character. Do not waste your time on this pathetic show use it wisely and go watch anything else!  Best recomendations Berserk, claymore, Hirugashi when they cry, Texhnolyze, Hellsing Ultimate, Gungrave, Elfen lied, Black lagoon, Casshern sins, Death note, Gantz cant think of anything else at the moment!",

            "content": "Wow so Blood-C.\r\nI can summarize it with one sentence but I'll go on. Blood-C is about a high school girl who's part demon (Elder Bairn) or something (skimmed through all the good parts on YouTube but still got the main idea) who makes a promise to a dog that can talk (assuming he's a spirit, it actually never says) that she has to save everyone from monsters in her town. She discovers she's part demon and can fight these monsters that eat the people in her town with a sword that was supposedly blessed by a maiden in the old shrine she lives inwith her father.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was REALLY good. That's probably the best thing I'm going to say about this show. The music was that kind of thriller, monster fighting scary music. It wasn't good but it set the mood. \\n\\n\r\nThese monsters that killed the people were BRUTAL. I have never seen a more gruesome show that animated killing people in such a fashion. The only thing that kept me watching (skipping through the show to gory parts) was the shock factor of seeing these people maimed and killed unreasonably. And no one is safe but the main character which sucks in my opinion. Everyone around her is dying and just when she dives and saves a guy and you're like, \"Whew at least she got that one,\" *Monster knocks her out of the way. Spiky tentacle goes through the guy's face that she just saved.* This show was twice as gory as Elfen Lied, and drawn in detail. One person dies while running away from a monster and gets hit in the neck by a big piece of falling glass from a window. No one is safe.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is pretty good when she's fighting the monsters because she's not getting beaten to a pulp, partially eaten with parts of her limbs falling to the ground, or getting impaled. The main character is fun and nice in the beginning but turns out to be a crazy half demon killing machine in the end who's trying to take down the person responsible for all this. Typical plot for a show about a girl who has to save a town from monsters though.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending. The ending was one of the crappiest endings I've ever seen for an anime. It was almost like they added this ending in last minute to explain why everyone was killed. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Blood-C was the goriest show I've ever seen with a brutal way of killing people that surpasses people getting killed by Titans in AoT and anyone killed by a diclonius in Elfen Lied. The only thing they didn't include was torture. Great animation, pretty good MC. Horrible story.\\n\\n\r\nBlood-C: 3/10 (Very Bad)",

            "content": "TL;DR\r\n+ new story for Blood series fans\r\n+ swordfights\r\n- too much gore*\r\n- direction\r\n- cheap looking visuals\r\n*possibly a + if... you know... you like it\r\nStory\r\nNew story in the Blood series! Indeed, Saya is back. For the better or worse, the only unchanged thing from old Saya is probably her name, hair color and fighting style, to the point where you can't be sure whether she's the old Saya or not... Story is completely new and unrelated to Blood+ series so you can watch them in either order, although Blood+ does provide a lot more background story.\r\nAnyway, Saya is back to murdering stuff. And she does so inpeaceful village, where she lives with her father in a shrine. She lives happily, helps cleaning shrine, drinks coffee, sings a song in the morning, goes to school, has lunch with friends, doing pretty much everything a japanese anime high school girl does. Problems occur when weird evil monsters threatening village appear. As a good shrine maiden, just like her mother she's sworn to slay them all with her trusty katana and protect the village. Smells fishy? For a good reason too, you'll have to see for yourself.\\n\r\nWhat I didn't like about the story was probably it's pacing. The overall idea is nice, but they turned it into episodic monster kill with gore as its main element. Felt like whole thing could be summed up in 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nHas some nice rural vistas, animation was ok at first but seemed pretty shitty (and sometimes hilarious) towards the end. The feeling I got from watching could be described as \"cheap\".\\n\r\nSaya's new character design is not too bad but god damn does she have hair. Where did it all come from should be a movie by itself. Other characters are not really memorable or special in any way (maybe just the cute twins). This anime being designed by CLAMP, you can expect to see tall characters with long limbs and males with triangular faces.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI don't like to talk too much about music, since it depends on opinion way too much. I'll just say the it was mostly fitting the situation. Voice acting was nothing special, it did convey the character types as they intended to, so I guess it's ok.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nTough to say something without spoiling, but I'll try. Characters include Saya, her father, her coffee maker and few of her classmates. Interactions between them are pretty much on level of any generic slice of life anime. With a twist. Not spoiling.\\n\r\nEvery other villager is there for the sole purpose of being eaten or ripped to pieces by one of the monsters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWas hyped at start, getting progressively less excited throughout the series, then little more excited again at the end. That being said, I didn't enjoy most of it, mainly because of the \"episodic monsters\". They were completely pointless and didn't lead anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nIt is no secret that a lot of people die in this anime. It's pretty bloody! What bothers me is that I didn't feel anything watching most of them die, simply because it was overdone. Those people played no role in the story, you didn't know them, they didn't know you. Their death was pointless yet creators still decided to put a lot of emphasis on it, because it has \"blood\" in a title so there has to be a lot of it. As fan of CLAMP's works this anime felt like betrayal. Could've been a lot better have they made a movie - just like they did with sequel, which I suggest you watch if you liked this one at least a bit.",

With that in mind I decided to watch this one, but I tried my best not to compare them too heavily to one another since I did want to give this one a chance.\r\nI will not say that Blood-C is a BAD anime. In reality I did enjoy it, but there are several criticisms that left me reeling during and after having watched it.\r\nFirstly, a lot of the violence was rather senseless, to me. It had a very \"KILL ALL THE THINGS!\" mentality, which is apparent in the first few episodes alone. The fightscenes were enjoyable less for their unpredictability (because they were rather predictable) than for their sheer intensity.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the fights WERE very intense - much more so than they were in Blood+. Dare I say, there is a lot more gore (although much of it is censored out, perhaps thankfully) than in its cousin, Blood+. The main character is a lot more likely to kick ass than Saya Otonashi was.\\n\\n\r\nThe revealing of information is a little slow and it isn't very organized. It IS a relatively short series, at 12 episodes, but they could have revealed information at a different pace than they did.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, as I said, I did enjoy the anime and I will say that it is good.

            "content": "So, my opinion on Blood-C. To put it simply, Blood-C is a gore anime. It can't really fit into the horror category as it's not scary, or unsettling, though it can become unintentionally funny, courtesy of the over the top violence. Its story is fairly simplistic, it starts off in a quaint school setting and then weird stuff happen. It's got plenty of action and bloodshed, so if you like this kind of stuff, you will find things to enjoy here. Personally, I do not like gore or splatter, I find it boring and rather tasteless, hence when I watched this I lowered my standards,I came here expecting only torrents of blood and no story whatsoever. Yet, I was surprised. The story does actually have some value to it, the characters aren't terrible either, more or less what you'd expect from any other anime series out there. That's not to say that the story is a masterpiece or anything, just that it's not a completely run-of-the-mill gorefest, and ultimately I found it to be good enough. It's only 12 episodes so you can watch it in one sitting if you fancy, some people may complain that it drags on for too long, but given how long some series are, I think 12 episodes are pretty good. Overall, I can't say I hated it, it could have been better but it also could have been worse, so I took it for what it was and I wasn't disappointed. It's a simple gore anime with plenty of monsters and a simple (yet not bad) plot twist at the end. For 12 episodes only, it was worth my time.",

            "content": "This is my first review I have ever written on MAL, just so you know - oh and this is my first time watching an anime from the 'Blood' series. This is spoiler free but if you want to read my rant on this anime check my blogpost on my profile.\r\n***Story: 6***\r\nWhile the first few episodes are very odd and slow paced, not adding anything significant to the plotline, it's the last (and second last) episode that makes it up. The first five episodes are lengthy and you will feel frustrated because nothing makes really sense storywise, but after that, the pacing gets a bitbetter and will pique your interests. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it's a pity the first half of this series is executed quite badly - since the final episode proves you that the producers/writers know how to write a good story. The potential of a good story is there, but it's the way it has been told that irritates me. Also, there are way too many plotholes.\\n\\n\r\n***Art: 7***\\n\\n\r\nThe art was, in my perspective, nice to look at. It is a feast for my eyes to see 'pretty' characters in a gory, splatter anime. The animations were clean and done well - I have seen animes with much 'lazier' animations.\\n\\n\r\n***Sound: 8***\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was probably one of the best things in Blood-C. The main piano theme is hauntingly beautiful, catchy and very memorable. The opening song was fitting too.\\n\\n\r\n***Character: 5***\\n\\n\r\nOther than the protagonist, Saya, there were no real character developments overall in the series. The side-characters were so-so and were nothing special at all - except for the twins who kept saying the same things at the same time (yes, I'm talking about THAT 'twin' clich\u00e9e thing in almost every anime containing twins *eyesroll*) which made them especially annoying.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, there was quite a potential for some more interesting, in-depth character growth overall. Even though the amount of episodes (12) might not seem enough to do that, I beg to differ, since other animes the same length have handled that better.\\n\\n\r\n***Enjoyment: 6***\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a splatter/gore anime fan, you will enjoy this, since the action is entertaining enough to keep you watching. However, the lack of profound story in the first few episodes can limit your enjoyment of watching Blood-C.\\n\\n\r\n***Overall: 6***\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a solid and fair 6, since it was able to make me want to watch the sequel. The last two episodes are game-changing and reveal so much story that it frustrates me that they threw the potential of a bomb anime away; as already mentioned, the pacing was way off in the beginning and the story overall could have been told better. It's the very last episode that made my initial rating of a 4 go up to a 6.\\n",

            "content": "I would like to clarify that I am unfamiliar with the original Blood series, so my opinion of Blood-C isn't affected by its predecessor(s).\r\nPros:\r\nThe first time through, Blood-C does a sufficient job of facilitating a strong sense of mystery and suspense. Let me emphasize: the first time through.\r\nThe animation is respectable and fluid, even though the art itself looks like something out of the 90s (which I actually like). Art-wise, Blood-C's strongest facet is its soundtrack.\r\nThe action in Blood-C is respectable.\r\nBlood-C has strong Grimdark and Lovecraftian themes and aesthetics.\r\nFaults:\r\nThe plot is a mess and generally left me feeling as if I wasted my time. Withoutgoing into specifics, the same plot points regarding Saya's (the main character's) vague memories were frequently presented, but with no real explanation or good clues, which put a damper on Blood-C's sense of development.\\n\\n\r\nBlood-C has an inconsistent tone. Constantly jumping from suspenseful monster battles to mundane discussions over tea to something of a blend thereof defeated any chance of Blood-C maintaining consistent suspense.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not afraid to say this: Blood-C has the biggest cop-out ending I've ever seen. The mystery and progress leading up to the finale is all nullified by a huge plot twist in which there is a ton of exposition clarifying all of the details that the audience couldn't have possibly deduced in the first place. Any suspension of disbelief is eliminated by the constant exposition.\\n\\n\r\nThe only upside of the ending is how unexpected it was. It was infuriating: in both good and bad ways.",

It starts off as a pretty normal slice of the day kind of an anime. It can be even a little bit boring while you wait for something bigger to happen. The scheme is the same - beautiful scenery, some singing, classes and the last 6 mins- fast battles with demons that doesn't look that good graphically in comparison with the anime as a whole (this is until ep 4). BUT then, oh my, prepare for LOTS OF DEATHS.BLOOD EVERYWHERE. There are censored moments for the younger viewers but sometimes i regret that. It can actually remind you of Shiki (still not as interesting though) if you've seen it - one after another and another.. and nobody in the freaking village finds it really strange??  And you start asking yourself questions why it is like that. And after ep 5 with the ghost stories there's finally some suspense going on about the truth, the promise, the voice (ahh that voice), about Saya herself and about that freaking coffee! Then 1 victim isn't enough and the pools of blood are just everywhere.. Yes, POOLS OF BLOOOOOD ! And what's annoying here is that \"I promised i'll protect you all\" part and in the next second you just watch people die and she's doing nothing until, well, they are dead.The last episode for me and the one before with it's revelations were kind of expected from me BUT they were kind of exciting and i think i'm gonna continue with the series as I want to know what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nBtw I'd like to add that i do like Tokizane's look and voice as well.

Blood-C was the worst of the Blood Franchise and possibly one of the worst animes around. Clamp was not best suited to create this anime. Blood-C's genre is mainly Supernatural bullcrap about Ayakashi which was completely different to its predecessor Blood+ which was Sci-Fi/Supernatural. Although the anime's story failed at every turn, the Main Character was undeniably prettier than the previous anime Main Character. Theartwork was not that bad but wasn't considerably excellent and the sounds too. The Characters were not that interesting save for some and there was nothing thrilling about this anime. The only reason I stuck to watch this anime was in the hope that it would change in some episode were the genre of Ayakashi crap was all a lie but to no avail was my effort.

            "content": "After thinking hard and long about it, this anime is exactly what we needed for the series. It does pull of a very \"monster of the day\" quality, but in the same vein, it captures a life of Saya we had not previously viewed as Blood fans. \r\nIf this is your first entry to the Blood series, then I hope you realize what you are in for. This series is chalk full of nightmare fuel. After finishing it in one sitting, I had to think about what I saw because it jarred me for a while. I was pretty shaky about it, especially in thelast episodes. Having grown a little since then, I realized that this is probably the most gory anime I have seen. If you do so happen to make it to finish all the episodes, I applaud you. I never quit what I start, so I was determined to watch this anime and give it a fair shot.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing this anime, you are left with anger and resentment. The movie clears up a lot of that, leaving you with a happy feeling that is odd coming from a gory anime. However, this anime does give you a sense of what has been missing from the Blood series for quite some time.\\n\\n\r\nSaya is powerful as ever, but that has never been a problem. It's her humanity that we see, and how she is so trusting to everyone around her. We see a side of her that we know will someday snap, so we keep watching. The Elder Bairns are frightening, and I give the writers credit for making me shaky. Imagine fighting those, and going home to sing like Saya does. Her dual nature is astounding. \\n\\n\r\nI think what makes it so intriguing is how they portray her. She is like an on/off switch, and can snap at any second. It's deadly how scary it is. Perhaps the true fear and nightmare fuel in this anime is how scary Saya is. She really does feel like a killer, but a good one at that.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one scene in particular that gave me nightmare fuel, which is in the last episode. I am sure you will see it and feel the same. Let's just say, it involves very badly deaths of humans and made me think on it for days. I lay awake in bed one morning just pondering it like, \"God. How scary.\"\\n\\n\r\nI dunno, it's usually the visuals that startle me. But I have grow more immune to it, mostly because I want to be brave in anime. There are tons of animes out there to witness, and I don't want to hold back because of fear.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are squeamish and hate blood, then you probably won't like this. Give it a shot, watch one episode. If you are not feeling it, back out and watch a fluffy anime to feel better. But don't miss out on this anime if you like it.

So get any notion of a connection right out of your head before you settle down to watch it or you shall (as i was) be bothered thruout by the comparisons you'll make between the three of them.\r\nI have no idea whether this is a good Anime or not because i spent the first half of it in constant bafflement as to how none of thestory, characters (including the main source of confusion herself: Saya) or the monsters lined up at all with either B:TLV or B+, and i spent the whole of the second half of the series forced to be awfully aware that, even tho it has nothing to do with the other two, it is mediocre in comparison (but saying that doesn't mean it's bad or even just average, it just seems so in comparison to two Animes that are, imo, brilliant!).\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, go in with a clean mind and don't compare it to Blood: The Last Vampire or Blood+ and you may enjoy this Anime (tho i can't give you a guarantee), and if you do let me know how it was... cause i still haven't got a clue.",

            "content": "I have not watched any of the other blood series or whatever at the time of this review, so I can't really compare them.\r\nI picked this show up when it ended just so i can see a certain bloody as hell scene in the end. And there are a lot more bloody scenes before it, it's even censored a lot since there's guts everywhere. Pretty much every episode has creatures known as Elder-Bairns dying by the main character, Saya, stabbing them through the face, neck, or slashing them in half with a \"sacred blade\" and also people being brutally killed by the creatures. \r\nThe firstcouple of episodes are repetitive, and it's basically monster of the week, but I thought it set up the anime by showing how happy and nice Saya is, and to familiarize the viewer with the cast and Saya's duty to kill Elder-Bairns. Saya is a shrine maiden who drinks black coffee every day at a coffee shop named Guimauve and sings on her way to school about how happy her life is. At night, and in later episodes during the day, she goes out to kill Elder-Bairns. It's really simple in the beginning, and it's what gets people to drop this show after 3 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe story really only appears at the end, where the whole situation with the Elder-Bairns is (for the most part) explained, and Saya and all the other character's situations explained. It's a bit difficult to understand, but  you can basically piece it together fairly easily despite how weird and unreasonable it all is. There's a few parts which may or may not make you feel sad about, but I teared up towards the end.\\n\r\nThe action is very well done, and the blood part is over exaggerated. Some parts about this show are inconsistent, and small things are forgotten like \"she didn't pick up her sword after dropping it\". Sometimes I felt they didn't do a good job of animating, especially when the people's bodies are all big and the head is so tiny, but other than that it was sleek and smooth. The monsters are sometimes just one color such as a shadow turning into a monster, and a train turning into some white mass of jelly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I rate it good, but I can't really pinpoint what makes it good. I doubt YOU will like it, but it's worth a try.",

            "content": "I have to be perfectly honest here, the reason I started watching Blood C was not because of its story, themes, or anything of the sort. What attracted me to Blood C was the copious amount of sexy violence, and to see a schoolgirl slaying demons. And I have to say, Blood C does certainly not disappoint when it comes to that, so let me get this over with right away: If you cannot handle blood, gore, people getting torn apart, eaten, bludgeoned or whatever other horrific death you can imagine, this anime is most definetly not for you and you may as well stopreading now. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are still with me here, allow me to backtrack a little bit. Blood C is part of the Blood franchise, being preceeded by Blood: The Last Vampire and Blood + and suceeded by Blood: The Last Dark. Now, I have not watched either of the two first ones. From a story perspective it does not matter too much, since there is no direct continuity, however you might hear from many that both Blood: The Last Vampire and Blood + are vastly superior, and I do want to watch those either to verify the veracity of these claims. Forgive my digression, let's continue. \\n\\n\r\n[Story: 5/10] The anime follows Kisaragi Saya, a seemingly normal schoogirl, a tad clumsy, somewhat awkward and oblivious to what is going on around her at times, but a cute, friendly person nevertheless. Of course that's not all there is to her, after all I am not reviewing Moe here, so of course she is a badass who slays demons, or Elder Bairns (Furukimono), as the anime refers to them. As the story progresses we learn more about Saya, the demons and the relationship between everything, since not everything is what it seems. The story however, takes its sweet bloody time actually going anywhere, and spends the first 5 or so episodes meandering about, taking a somewhat \u201emonster of the week\u201c-esque approach to its story-telling, which for a 12 episode series is just ridiculous. Which is a shame, because the story is not even that bad, but Blood C shoots itself in the foot by not fucking telling it for almost half of the show. What we get instead are fight scenes (which are the best part of the show) that end in very slightly increasingly ominous ways. The final act a.k.a the last two episodes, then proceeds to show us the characters' true motivations and backgrounds. Like, all of them, including the main bad guy. And the ending, while not bad, forces whomever wants to get some actual fucking closure, to watch the sequel movie. If the show had a more even build-up to its story, it might have been a lot better, but as it is anyone is forgiven for dumping Blood C into a dumpster after the abortion that are the first episodes.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters: 5/10] There is no way around this, so I'll be brutally honest, the characters are shit. Except for Saya, and the main baddy, whose name I cannot reveal so as not to spoil the twist at the end, there is no character-development, no one I could empathize with, no motivation that seemed believable... in short nothing positive. The twins are annoying, not cute, not adorable, just annoying and the rest of the gang never escapes the clich\u00e9s we have all seen before. They don't contribute in the slightest to the story until the very end, so they are of no real importance besides being cannon-fodder. Now, Saya is done fairly well, so is the main baddy, but even there, since the story does not conclude until the end of the subsequent movie, their arcs don't conclude either, which might leave those of you, who don't feel like watching the movie (although, you might as well, if you've come as far, as the last episode) a bit disappointed. I have to be a bit lenient, since the story was not meant to finish there, and the movie does conclude them fairly well, but again, I have to be critical of the characters, who similarly to the story, don't change, don't evolve, until the final act of the anime, with the only arguable exception being Saya.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 6/10] The art and animation are, for the most part good, if unexceptional. The character designs are nothing to write home about, except for the Furukimono, which do look quite nice. Saya's design is cool, no complaints there. The animation does of course stand out gloriously during the glorious fight scenes, which is also where the violence does its merry dance under the spotlight, which is nice. There are a couple of scenes, where the proportions of the characters are jarringly strange, which really caught my eye, but thankfully that is not frequently the case. Overall, the aesthetics are a bit bland, but nothing criminally bad. \\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 7/10] The sound was good, everything from the characters' voices to the music is solid with some standouts, like the OP and the main theme. The sound does its job, the music emphasizes the action, smoothes the calm moments, all when needed. Even Saya's little cheery song, which she sings constantly, is cute, and when the story starts showing its tragic side, the song becomes more dissonant adding to her development. The characters' voices add to their personalities and development, but none of them stand out in any way. I have nothing to really complain about here.\\n\\n\r\n[Personal Enjoyment: 7/10] As I mentioned in the introductory sentence, I did not watch the show expecting it to be the next Ergo Proxy, I did not expect to be utterly blown away. I wanted blood and gore and a schoolgirl killing stuff with a Katana, which is exactly what I got. I do have a soft-spot for that type of stuff, and if that is what you are looking for, if all you want is some action, that does not require your full mental capacities to follow, you might wanna check out Blood C, and by extension the sequel movie and previous installments. Expect nothing more though, as you will leave disappointed if you do. Also, watch an uncensored version, because otherwise you will be watching a white or black screen for much of the exiting bits, which is annoying, and as I said, if you cannot handle violence, you should not be watching this anime in the first place, since it is incredibly bloody and gory. \\n\\n\r\nSo, all in all, I was not disappointed. I was annoyed at the first episodes, at the characters and some other minor stuff, which might seem to contradict what I said just now, but I really was not disappointed; I got what I wanted, nothing more, not too much less. The show could definetly have been executed a lot better, if it paced itself more competently, but I do not mourn over it, like some fans of the franchise might. I don't regret watching it, Saya is a badass, whom I enjoyed as a character, some of the music I still listen to at times and I have something to recommend to all those who want some bloody, fun, action and badassery. \\n\\n\r\n[6/10]",

I finished this only because I just went with the flow, seeing where it was going and how it could possibly end. But the writer seemed to make it look like he was making it up as he went along, because the concept I was getting throughout the time I was watching it was completely changed in the last episode. I enjoyed the idea that was going but the problem was breaking the flow at the end,then leading onto the movie (that I still need to watch at this time). But if I was to mention good points about the Anime, it would be the extreme blood, painting the walls.  Even though in the last scene it just takes the whole thing to a stupid level. I would only recommend this to people who just want to see people bleed to dead and getting limbs ripped off.",

            "content": "Most people will see this anime and dislike it seeing only the silly high school drama and the gory mess. They will not understand the unique set up of this story. I give Clamp props for taking this in a new direction as well as giving tribute to the previous Blood franchises.\r\nThe Story: This is not a usual story for an anime and is actually pretty dark. The basis of the plot is along the lines of the age old theory of Nature vs. Nurture. In the case of this anime, it explores deeply this concept and the psych of a person when their seemlynormal life is shattered over and over. A lot of this is hidden behind happiness and well placed foreshadowing that can easily be missed. It really begs the question of what would happen to a person when all that they are is stripped and all that is left is false memories and people? Also a lot of death. A LOT.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Nothing major really. The animation flows well and the fight scenes are well done. Not the best animation I've seen but hey it's not even close the the worse or even the average. It's just like any other Clamp animation and I am okay with that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting (I mostly watched dubbed) was well done. The voices matched the characters even if Saya at times was annoying. I'm pretty sure this was on purpose though to showcase the major changes that Saya is experiencing at the time and if you watch the movie it will be more obvious (I was surprised by the difference in tone since the same voice actor was used in both the series and movie). The music blends well with the rest of the anime and though not earth shattering it did not cause awkward moments due to ill-placed timing. The sound effect were spot on as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: There is not much to say about the characters as they are not explored in-depth really. The only real character that gets development is Saya. She must explore deeply into who she is and question everything that she knows. All the 'main' characters show little development for the purpose of the twist near the end. They appear as normal students and have little sway in the story but that is also on purpose. The only character that needs to have any impact really is Saya and there is a lot to her character if you look. And yes even I found her annoying at times but really how can she not when she is constantly under influence and kept clueless. Oh, and all the extras are creepily disregard as 'human' and treated as livestock basically.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I was scared to watch this anime for a long time because of all the bad things I have heard. I actually saw the movie first and enjoyed it then bought both on sale. I think I might enjoy this because of the fact that I was a Psychology major. All the human conflict and motives intrigued me. I have followed the Blood franchise for a long time and each new series had a different take on Saya. I sort of felt a connection between this series and some of the others. The uniform in the memories (and the beginning of the movie) is close to the original and a sense that Saya has been around for a long time but has been involved in both Japan and America also hints to the original plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I would not write this anime off easily. It's actually pretty deep and really dark and disturbing. It made me think hard. I also watched the movie which brought back the 'real' Saya after her experiences in the series. I would recommend both but caution to not bunch it together with all the other Blood series because it is different. This story explores more of a mental battle while still providing killing of the usual 'monsters'. The movie is actually closer to the old Blood series well still focusing on how the events in the series is now effecting Saya as she seeks revenge.",

            "content": "This show is not for the faint of heart. There is a lot of blood and gore and weird moments that can and probably will make your skin crawl, heart pound, and head scream.\r\nStory: The story is an interesting one. I don't really want to give it a summary because that I feel that it won't do the show any justice. It's 12 episodes of monsters and blood and gore and happy school days, but the last 2 episodes some crazy stuff starts to happen. \r\nArt: The visuals are very nice in the show. They're very consistent and they nothing really seemed out of placeat all during the series. The blood and deaths are animated well, almost too well. The fights aren't terrible but they can be lackluster.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This show introduced me to my favorite opening theme I've ever heard. The ending sounds very good too but it still doesn't hold a candle to the opening in my opinion. The music in the show is great. There were about 3 prevalent tracks that set the mood and tone to the situation very well. The sound however was a little weird. When Saya, the main character hits things with her sword it doesn't sound right and its a little too loud for the most part. It only sounds satisfying when she lands the slices instead of bouncing off the target. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are all kind of boring and don't get much screen time aside from the MC, which plays to the advantage of the end of the show. There isn't much development until the end though. It was a good move for what the show is but it left me with a dry taste in my mouth about the whole thing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the show. I indulged my inner masochist that wanted to cringe at the horrible and brutal deaths and bone chilling, blood curdling screams. Don't go in expecting something amazing, but go in expecting a monster blood fest with some weird stuff going on and it should turn out ok for you.",

(Can't say anything else otherwise it'll be ruined)......\\n\\n\r\nAt first I blamed her appearence in the town on everyone, then her friends and the I managed to pin point who was responsible for it all and kept on watching. turns out I was partially right and partially wrong.\\n\\n\r\nthe story line itself is quite confusing to me but I didn't have to watch any of the episodes over again to understand it. I do think its a bit rushed though and should of been extended. As it only has 12 Episodes and we start to learn the truth about Saya near the end in episode 11 it makes the other episodes seem a little bit pointless to me, only because I would of started revealing more in episode 8 if the series was only 12 episodes long . but I guess that's for you to decide and not me.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is amazing but I wish I could of seen a few more episodes and less blurs over dead bodies as ive seen it all before and because of this i have to give this series a 4 star rating. I wish i could of given it a 5 but it just doesn't tick that box for me......if you've watched this series then sorry!!!!\\n\\n\r\nSaturday 12th January 2013. 9:14 PM. ~AmyXxx",

I'm only giving it a 9 for the sound because they really got the bone crushing, pulling apart limbs from limbs, and chewing sounddown.

Before I even started watching this anime, I was bombarded with negative criticisms.  I just thought, \"You guys are a bunch of haters, I'm watching it anyways.\"  Me and my big mouth.  At times I wondered whether I might have nightmares about the poor quality of the anime.\r\nOkay, to prevent ranting, let's go in a systematic manner.\r\nStory: Story?  Oh yeah, story.  I think the people who made this anime forgot a few times thatin order for an anime to be good, the story needs to be reasonable.

The story dipped and dived at times, and so did my enthusiasm, but honestly, and for reasons that I'm not too sure of, I can't wait for the sequel movie.",

            "content": "After Blood+ comes another series from the successful Blood Franchise.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026..\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nBlood+ is one of my favorites and belonged to my top lists of best anime ever so I am so excited to see another story from the famous franchise. The amazing thing about Blood Franchise is the stories are always packed with almost all elements needed for an amazing and very interesting story. There is supernatural, drama, a little bit of romance, psychological, mystery, suspense-thriller, and tons of actions. Plus, it is about a female in action. I just love stories about female in actions, particularly girls with katana ora sword for that matter which I really love. And because it is supernatural it is very mysterious. The mysteries keep on piling up with every episode which make the story absolutely exciting and interesting. And because of that, the revelations at the end is very anticipating and worth the wait. There is a lot difference from Blood+; from the story to characters to the animation. The story is more mysterious, dramatic, psychological, and a lot more gruesome or there\u2019s more blood. Well, the title is blood so it is given that every new adaptation would have more blood than the usual. However, because of its mysteriousness the storyline can be really confusing. Well, the story is made by CLAMP which is known for their very confusing yet so damn interesting storyline and plot. Their work can be really confusing but in an amazing and brilliant way.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nAside from the main character, literally all the characters are very much mysterious and so interesting. There\u2019s even an important character that you wouldn\u2019t understand if you are not a CLAMP works follower or if you don\u2019t know the series which the character is from. As always, that character crosses over in this series as it is a very well-known trademark of CLAMP.  Characters that crosses over to many different series is one of the most amazing and brilliant work of CLAMP. With all the confusion with the story, his character somehow can be considered as an assurance about the revelations later. In the previous Blood franchise, all the monsters looked almost alike but this time it varies with so many kinds. \\n\\n\r\nAbout SAYA\\n\r\nCompared to the previous protagonists, Saya is cheerful and na\u00efve to what really is happening around her. More than being so mysterious, she\u2019s the most confusing of all because even after people die she can just have a nice coffee or sing a song or say good morning the next day. It is pitying and pretty irritating that bodies are keep piling up around her and let it happen even while watching. It is not very heroic at all considering she keeps on mumbling that she promised that she would protect everyone. She would make some cool moves right after everyone is dead which is extremely useless. AND SO I THOUGHT\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. It turned out that she\u2019s the most pitying of all. There\u2019s nothing more horrifying than finding out that everything you knew was just one hell of a lie. And what\u2019s even worse, she is just being played by literally all the people she thought she knew.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION\\n\r\nThe animation is the best so far among all the Blood Franchise. It is very latest and you really can feel that it is very now. The fight scenes are just heart-pounding and so amazing. That\u2019s one of many reasons why I love Blood Franchise. For someone who has been following CLAMP works for so many years, somehow I practically guessed that the characters are designed by them even before knowing it. You can definitely feel that it is their work. And the characters are probably one of the most gorgeous characters I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just say that waiting for another work from the franchise is so damn worth the wait. Blood Franchise never ceases to amaze me. It can be really confusing for almost all parts of the whole series but let me tell you that the revelations at the end is just so worth it. This is one of the amazing things about CLAMP\u2019s stories; they will give you so much mixed emotions with their work and later will amaze you with its true plot. With the combination of the two most successful in the world of anime and manga, Blood Franchise and CLAMP definitely brought us an elevated anime experience. With a very irritating ending because of the villains getting away, the movie is genuinely anticipating.\\n",

            "content": "Ok, I just finished watching the anime.  The anime series itself was very boring and kept me waiting for something good that did not come until the last episode.  The last episode actually kept me wanting more but it ended, what the hell.   The entire series had no plot or substance, the author waited to the end to make you get into the series.   I just hope that the movie will close up the story with much more action and not so much gore.",
