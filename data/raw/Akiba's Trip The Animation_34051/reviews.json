            "content": "Ah, Akihabara. Otaku center of the world. Filled to the brim with anime, manga, video games, computer goods, maid caf\u00e9s, and vampires. \r\nAkiba's Trip The Animation feels like a love letter to Akiba and every nerdy interest you can think of. Is it a masterful work of writing? No. Is it thought provoking? No. Is it enjoyable? I'd like to think so. Isn't that why we watch anime? To enjoy ourselves?\r\nThe premise is quite simple. Akiba has been overrun by vampires known as \"Bugged Ones\" and the only way to defeat them is to strip them of their clothes and expose them to sunlight. Dependingon your tolerance for fan service there's your indication as to whether or not you should bother starting the show. However, for those coming in because they're thinking the show will have the same amount of fan service as Prison School for example, you'll be disappointed as the fan service is quite minimal considering the premise of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's strongest asset in my eyes is how much heart it feels went into the show. As previously mentioned the show is a love letter to Akiba and every nerdy interest you can think of. Computers, card games, audiophiles, Street Fighter, wrestling, and more. Every episode is an affectionate parody of these subcultures and is both the show's biggest strength and weakness. If you're familiar with what they happen to be parodying that episode you will enjoy yourself immensely, but if not, you might feel like you're being left out of the joke. This results in each episode being quite hit or miss. Not every episode will be a hit, but when they are, my God do they hit.\\n\\n\r\nThis love and passion for these interests leads to a payoff when it comes to the show's comedy. The accuracy of the wrestling tropes. A person's descent into becoming an audiophile. How a card game looks for people who know what's going on vs people who don't know a thing about the game. They know what will make people who enjoy these interests laugh and they make good use of that knowledge. The show knows how stupid it is and revels in by going completely over the top whenever possible. It's not afraid to poke fun at itself either by occasionally referencing various characteristics of the show itself. It's all comedic gold.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't particularly complex and developed, but would you expect anything different? That's not to say they\u2019re walking tropes however. Tamotsu escapes being a bland nerd MC and Arisa shows off her loyalty when faced with an important decision. It's not much, but it's something. But frankly in a show like this the development and complexity of the characters isn't important. What is important however is how likable they are. The group is full of energy and enthusiasm when the times are good, and when push comes to shove they'll go out of their way to show how much they care about each other.\\n\\n\r\nCould I talk about the art or the sound? Sure, probably. But frankly they're not remarkably good or bad enough to justifying writing about and I don't see a point in telling you something is completely average just for the sake of padding out the amount of words in this review.\\n\\n\r\nFor me Akiba's Trip has been the surprise of the season and was a complete joy to watch. The show knew what it wanted to achieve and passed with flying colours. It's goofy, it's fun, it's energetic, it's hilarious, it's Akiba's Trip.",

            "content": "Sometimes an anime comes along that changes your perspective of the media. It questions your core values, your beliefs and makes you wonder will we ever see another anime like this. For some it can leave an empty void making you wonder what will you watch next.\r\nBut enough about incredible shows like Steins;Gate and Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Im sadly here to review Akiba's Trip.\r\nI would like for everyone to remember at this point that a Review involves expressing ones opinion. If you don't like it? Well good for you, I'll give you a chocolate digestive if I see you around (and a cupof tea, gotta keep up the British Stereotype) .\\n\r\n\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory ?/10 -\\n\\n\r\nThis anime involves ripping off someone's clothes to win. Now when you read that your first thought is most likely \"I am sure I didn't tick R18?\" or \"Have I ended up on the weird part of the internet again?\". Sadly no, otherwise I would of closed the browser and wouldn't have lost a piece of my soul...... I am fairly certain a 4 year old could create a better basis than this show has. \\n\r\nBefore the keyboard defenders type \"But you rated this higher than Akibas Trip!\" or \"If you don't like ecchi why are you watching?\", I don't know a sad curiousity at how ludicrously awful something can get? And clearly I also have no life.\\n\r\nThe comedy throughout the entirety of this show feels so forced it's so awkward to watch.......I can't really give the story rating because is ripping off clothes really an anime story? It's just failed soft core pornography. \\n\r\nDid the studio think they struck gold with this concept? \"Oh yay stripping clothes off people to win. Sure to give us lots of money!\" . Oh wait anime is either just for kids or hentai right? Course they thought that. Imagine going 25 years as studio and this is how you celebrate.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters Non-Existent/10 -\\n\\n\r\nOh yay! Characters......I honestly reckon placing cones or cardboard cutouts of characters in place of the ones in this show would provide as much to the story. It would get rid of the fan service too. Infact lets just put cute puppies in place instead? Least then i can go awww cute....\\n\\n\r\nArt 1/10 -\\n\\n\r\nOh boy the art! This is where the show.....\"shines\" . I think the studio had the same thoughts as me when it came to the art. They made a few characters correctly then got bored, realised they were wasting away with an awful show and just randomly drew characters like a spoiled child who had enough of his expensive toy. It reached the stage where I honestly felt like they were attempting to troll people watching it got that bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound 2/10 - \\n\\n\r\nIt's got more than a 1 out of 10! Thank you so much EARPHONES.....You were the hero we needed, but maybe the one we didn't deserve for doing an opening that for 1 minute 30 seconds, I embraced the wonder of thinking I was watching something interesting. Sadly after the opening I came crashing down to reality faster than , realising the music for this is very poor.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment ?/10 -\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment on this show depends on one thing....Whether you watch alone or in a group. If you want in a group, suffering together with someone will make the pain more bearable. Watching alone is something I do not recommend.......\\n\\n\r\nConclusion -\\n\\n\r\nFun fact the studio that did Akiba's Trip also did Welcome to the N.H.K and Afro Samurai. Oh the mighty have fallen to quote the Dark Knight himself \"You either die a hero, or live long enough to become the villian.\" If you plan on watching Akiba's Trip, I recommend instead you go find yourself a great wall (not Trumps.....But a wall) , and watch that instead. I can tell you for certain, its more enteraining.",

            "content": "[This is my first review, so if you see grammar mistakes or typos, please bear with me]\r\nAkiba's Trip is an anime based of a game about stripping. I don't know about the game tho, but the anime is good enough to make me kept watching 'til the end. It's a bit early for me to review this (since there's only 4 episodes out at the time I'm writing this) but since another users have reviewed this, yea.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nVery dumb. In Akiba, there's something called Bugged Ones who possess people living around there to make them evil. To make them back to their \"previous\" side, themain heroes Tamotsu (not Mokkun from Boku no Pico, lol) and the red-haired girl should undress them. Then Tamotsu got interested for something like idols (ep 3) and radios (ep 4). He even managed to buy everything related to it, with a really high price. Because of his interest, he got to met some Bugged Ones. (like in the pool of ep 3)\\n\\n\r\nPretty dumb, right? Since almost every Bugged Ones are girl, you know what's going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the colors and the character design. The animation is ok, it goes well with the budget. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, ED, and the OST were forgettable. I can't even remember a single bit of the OP. The voice acting is nice tho.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nForgettable cast. I only remember Tamotsu because his name sounds like Mokkun from BnP, the rest were forgettable. There is a fanservice generator (the yellow-haired girl), Tamotsu's sister, and a red-haired girl who managed to kiss Tamotsu. Also, a professor with a really long name. After writing that, I realized that's a pretty generic cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBecause I don't mind the ecchi part, I really enjoyed this. For those who hate ecchi, you wouldn't enjoyed this to it's maximum.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nPass if you hate fanservice/ecchi, watch if you dont care and need your daily dose of another ecchi comedy.",

            "content": "The beautiful thing about comedy is that it's subjective.  It's an extremely wide topic where there're a multitude of ways to go about it, with the main goal being getting those watching or listening to laugh at the end.  So, how does one go about making the ridiculous plot of stripping off peoples' clothes entertaining?  Well, by shoving in references of course.\r\nStory: Akihabara, the place of hopes and dreams is threatened by an unseen threat.  Bugged ones, creatures who lurk in the dark, seek to take over the otaku capital and rule over it by their own laws and values.In order to beat them, one must expose the people they inhabit to light.  Which means, strip the person to their undergarments.  But never fear, the team consisting of three teenagers and a middle schooler known as Electric Mayonnaise is here!  Oh god, we're still screwed aren't we?\\n\\n\r\nBased on a game series with the same name, Akiba's Trip The Animation takes the gameplay elements of fighting the enemies by stripping them in the Akihabara setting and nothing else.  The entire series is made with completely new characters and features a storyline entirely of one-off episodic adventures that each feature a theme pertaining to either one part of Otaku culture with varying degrees of comedic success.  Each episode acts like its own zany and wacky adventure where the characters always end up fighting a Bugged One as the episode's \"Final Boss\" before returning back to their normal lives and back to the status quo of the series.  \\n\\n\r\nComedy comes in the form of exaggeration and quickly timed jokes that snap in and out as fast as they come.  Due to the show's fast-paced nature, the show never sits on one joke for too long, and keeps going along with the series's momentum to make sure keep the audience engaged to the end.  Though the jokes can be hit or miss both depending on what you're a fan of (since they cover quite a wide variety of topics), and due to how blunt and not subtle everything is, the show is very consistent on how it wants to do things and doesn't falter on what it wants to deliver.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's...all there is.  Packed full of references (both real world and from other series'), Akiba's Trip The Animation is quite simply a sporadic episodic story that uses the exact same storyline for each episode with the only variation being how the story is set up, what each episode's theme is, and what kind of boss they're fighting in the end.  There honestly isn't much to say.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Episodic storyline (depends on your taste)\\n\r\n+/- Blunt, fast-paced comedy (depends on your taste)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Development is very slim for the characters in Akiba's Strip, as the fast-paced comedic nature of the series makes it very difficult for any meaningful development to happen to any of its characters.\\n\\n\r\nElectric Mayonnaise, the titular group of the series, consists of 3 (technically 5?) members.  Mayonaka Matome is a Bugged One who fights to save Akihabara from those that want to take the district for themselves, Tamotsu Denkigai is an otaku turned Bugged One who's more than happy to defend Akihabara and save it from potential doom, and Ahokainen Arisa is a blonde foreigner who's basically a Mary Sue, capable of doing...almost everything (somehow) while cosplaying at every chance she has.  In short, what you see is what you get, as their characters barely change throughout the entire series.  If anything, you get to learn more about their personalities and what they've done, but beyond that, there's nothing much to say.  The other two characters that are technically part of Electric Mayonnaise are Denkigai Niwaka, Tamotsu's little sister, and the professor, who's this tiny girl with a large labcoat on a segeway.  Likewise, what you see is what you get, and like the main trio, are characters that barely change in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bugged Ones that act as villains in the series are quite simple.  They all want to take over Akihabara in some strange yet convoluted manner.  They act more like the episode's final boss that our main characters must fight at the episode's climax more than anything, and have very little beyond their characters beyond their motivation to rule Akiba.  \\n\\n\r\nThere're quite a number of side characters in this show, spanning shokeepers in Akiba, to random characters that get featured in the series once or twice that all add one or two things to the series, culminating to the spastic feel that is this show.  They're not really all that important, but they help spice what's already there.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Defined, entertaining characters\\n\r\n-  Entire cast is one note\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Gonzo, Akiba's Trip boasts a colorful, erratic, and wild artsyle that further compliments the comedy of the series.  Everything from the characters' movements to the the backgrounds and settings is done in a distracting yet entertaining way that compliments the fast paced nature of the series.  Though the show isn't always consistent in this manner.  The background audience for a large majority of the scenes are white figures with smiley faces rather than handdrawn characters, so in this regard, while it fits to the outlandish nature that this show boasts, has hit or miss qualities.  \\n\\n\r\nFanservice is actually quite common in this show, which isn't very surprising when the show is about stripping people naked to save a district in Japan.  Though they're blatant with it, fanservice doesn't actually come all that often, and when it's done, it's not so overglorified that it detracts from the show, though that does happen on occasion.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I think where the art really exceeds expectations is in some of the real life references that they were able to execute in this show.  First off, they got real life sponsors to make cameos.  Not only that, but in one episode, they were able to get real footage from Street Fighter V of all things in their show.  Now these might not be too difficult to obtain, but the fact that the show was able to get some stuff from real life into the show was in my eyes, pretty cool, especially since most anime that do something like this make their own parody versions to avoid copyright and other legal problems.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Colorful and crazy art to fit the show\\n\r\n+ They legit got Capcom to let them use Street Fighter footage in an episode\\n\r\n-  Laziness in some aspects of the art\\n\\n\r\nSound: As far as sound goes, Akiba's Trip's OP has a high energy beat reflective of that to the series it comes from.  Complete with idol singing and a clear fast beat, the OP is, while isn't all that memorable when not put on repeat, is a nice, fast song to listen to.  EDs in Akiba's Trip vary, as roughly each episode has its own ED with the main draw of all of them being the fact that they're all idol songs.  Similarly, not as memorable as they could be, but still nice listens.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: If you ask me, I'll tell you that Akiba's Trip is a stupid, pointless show that has no value aside from being brainless entertainment.  And that's precisely why I love it.  The show to an extent is self-aware of its own merits and it owns up to them, enhancing its dumb and energetic self to create a fun to watch show that despite not being serious in the slightest, can still be enjoyable.  I liked it, and more important than anything, I enjoyed and had fun with it.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nOh far too much.  The fact that the show was self-aware of its own stupidity made it that much easier to enjoy its random episodes.  In particular, the episode where they talk about card games (I think it was episode 8) was the episode that resonated with me the most.  Not only that, but I like Mayonaka as a character.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, there wasn't really much to hate for me.  I wouldn't call this one of my favorite series, but I had so much fun watching this show that I really had no reason to dislike it at all for any reason.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're into stupid, brainless, and sporadic comedy shows like me, then Akiba Strip is a pretty good pick.  Its episodic nature and completely non-serious demeanor makes this show a fun venture to watch.  Though same with all comedy, it is subjective to a specific audience, so if you're not a fan of in your face humor, then this is probably not the show for you.",

            "content": "If you know the game that this anime is based on you'd expect it to be fanservice city.Well let me warn you, it's not. There is some fanservice here and there and it can be quite nice but this show does not live and die off of fanservice. It actually lives and breathes off of comedy. And it is really good at it.\r\nThe comedy of Akiba's Trip is specialized and really out there. They don't settle with just making a job plain they really go all the way out there and really proclaim it. The fiendish plans range from silly but plausible to WTF HOWDO YOU THINK THIS WOULD WORK!? And it works because each plan is more stupid than the last until it gets to the point of just HOWWW. Everything is exaggerated in this show. The farther into each episode the more exaggerated it gets. It's great to see all the twists and turns that they throw in. Not only do they throw in great exaggerations but they also model it to fit into the realm of okatuness that they are covering for the episode. This acts as a celebration of okatu culture which is a novel idea. Furthermore, it does so in unique and fun ways only adding to the joy of each episode. \\n\\n\r\nAiding the comedy is a great cast of characters. Each one of them feels refreshing and interesting in their own rights. Tomatsu is not the typical self-insert bland MC. He's super dedicated to one thing at a time, and with push himself to do the best at that one task, showing an unusual amount of drive. He's also a complete hipster. His cell phone looks dated. He's always looking up alternative methods to do the okatu habits that he enjoys rather than sticking to the tried and true. This makes him that much more interesting as a character.\\n\\n\r\nHis little sister Niwaka is also great. It's clear that she loves Tomatsu as a sibling but it never goes beyond that. She wants him but she doesn't cling to him, nor is what she does defined by him. She also hangs out more with the other girls that surround Tomatsu as well. Even if she has some of the imouto traits, she's refreshing as she's honest and doesn't define herself only by her onii-chan, rather she feels like a real sister who does care for her brother. (She's also not annoying and she doesn't try to push him into things, she's a pretty cool person.)\\n\\n\r\nMayo and Arisa are also both great characters. They all have likeable charm to them even though Mayo does stay in the tsundere character. (Although she does grow warmer over the span of the show.) Overall the characters all have their own likeable charms while still sticking to a general role. While they aren't the most developed they are refreshing and fun and thusly enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nI'd argue the plot is pretty cool too. The general plot leaves open a hype ending as well as provides the context for the fun of the episodic nature of the show. The comedy is enhanced by the episodic nature because they can keep on making things more extreme which each episode, using the same formula and providing twists to keep it fun. All it all it creates a nice structure for the show to work with, which helps its success.\\n\\n\r\nIt also happens to have some nice sorta unexpected development which I quite enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation I feel like it pretty strong and the art can be quite humorous. Some of the character designs are really well done while others are quite funny in their simplicity. It's enjoyable to see the wide range of character designs they have from cool to cute, to silly simple. The music is also pretty good too. I wouldn't call the OST great but there are some nice memorable tracks which help the show out.\\n\\n\r\nAll and all it's a great show with the ability to provide refreshing characters, a nice plot and development and most importantly a lot of good comedy. And it provides all of this while also giving a supporting message to Okatu culture. A message that we shouldn't judge others for what we do because we're all working off our passion and that's great. I'd recommend it if you'd like a fun and silly show. It's quite a good one. \\n",

            "content": "Akiba's Trip The Animation rekindles a love for Saturday morning cartoons that I'd forgotten I had. One of the last things I expected when going in to the series was a gang of crusaders defending an otherwise helpless city with the help of supernatural abilities and a quirky scientist. Villains are established and defeated on an episode-to-episode basis and, although it's a format that has the potential to run dry, Akiba's Trip read the blueprints well and constructed a very entertaining experience.\r\nIt's true that The Animation differs wildly from the game that it's based off of, but in no way should this be objectively heldagainst the anime. Taking Akiba's Trip and transforming the primary concept into something else entirely should be praised, given how well this task was accomplished by studio Gonzo. The expressive animation shines colorfully throughout the series and translates each character's personality beautifully, especially in the exuberant fight sequences that staple each episode together. The comedy that ties each character interaction and plot development is never flat or dull and, again, I find myself praising Gonzo for their exceptional grasp on the writers' intentions. The fanservice is an integral part of the story, and yet it never feels distracting from the other elements that each episode explores. You'll find yourself engrossed enough in the various situations that Tamotsu and friends stumble into that the disrobing only feels natural and, often times, comical.\\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult to give The Animation anything higher than an 8 when the story itself is inherently restrictive on how far the writers can push their creativity. Our main cast never leaves the city of Akihabara, there is very little focus on any consistent over-arcing antagony (other than the Bugged Ones in general), and room for character development is slim at best. However, the show works very well in the space it has created for itself. I've had an enjoyable trip across the 7 episodes I've seen so far and I would highly recommend Akiba's Trip to anyone who earnestly enjoys anime like Sailor Moon that progress themselves on an episodic basis. Kill La Kill fans should also appreciate the balance Akiba's Trip offers in its fanservice, sakuga, and comedy.",

            "content": "Do you remember that feeling of watching a cartoon as a child? Would you ever want to feel like that again? If the answer is yes, then here you go, this is it but with boobs, asses and even DICKS!\r\n*Disclaimer: Don't expect to see any of that though, it's all censored of course. \r\nThe concept like that has been seen before of course, this is not anything new, but mix that with the intent of showcasing any type of phase that exists in the world and you may just find a winner for some of us in the anime community. With that being said, Ipresent you with Akiba's Trip The Animation, based on the somewhat popular series of games, this is probably the most explosive and bombastic anime of Winter 2017.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole idea of Akiba's Trip is not one that I would call simple. Tamotsu and his sister Niwaka go to Akihabara, which just like in our world is a place full of otaku merchandise, anime, manga, maid cafes and such. In one of the shops with exclusive goods he meets Arisa, a busty girl from Finland and they quickly bond over figurines. Later he also runs into Mayonaka who is a part of defense group that protects the place from incidents, but it turns out there's more to it. Monsters invade Akiba and as Tamotsu rushes to save his sister he gets tangled up in the war between the two groups. He receives special powers that end up trapping him. Without much choice he becomes the protector Akiba deserved and desperately needed.\\n\r\nSome of you may see this as a generic plot, but you forgot one part of it all- the title. Sure, you could just read it as a trip to Akiba, but if you could just take that s and put it next to the second word, you'll understand that this anime is going to offer more than just the plot. It's gonna offer all the \"plots\", if you know what I'm saying *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge*\\n\r\nEkhm... sorry about that.\\n\r\nThe way that the Bugged Ones - the previously mentioned monsters that disguise themselves as humans - are defeated, is by stripping them down completely. You can expect a lot of character fanservice in here, all damage is done through ripping off clothes so that's kinda obvious, but I feel like it's a very important part of all the craziness that it tries to portray.\\n\r\nSpeaking of the craziness, the most important part of it is the format of the show. It's like an episodic \"adventure\" type of a show with the last couple of episodes trying to create an ending for a season. It's something that I immediately connect with the cartoons that I watched when I was younger, kinda like Teen Titans or Ben 10. Putting this into an anime isn't anything new, far from it. It's been used a lot, but not in the way that those previously mentioned shows do. Akiba's Trip embraces itself entirely. It knows it's a trashy show and it should only concentrate on fun, possibly leaving some space for an arc at the end of it. I wouldn't say it's a justification of how the show lacks serious progression through over half of its runtime or how every story has to end in one episodes, it's just my way of experiencing the show and seeing it for what it is rather than as something it clearly never aimed for. This show doesn't try to be serious, even if may seem like it does, it always plays it for the laughs in the end. It's self-aware, knows who it panders to, often touches on the topic of who are otakus and knows its limits. I really appreciate how this series handles the topics of unity and the otaku culture. It's actually beautiful. Still, this leaves the viewer with the question: Is that enough?\\n\r\nNow the answer will depend on the content of the episodes, so let's talk about that. As I mentioned, Akiba's Trip indulges itself in its trashiness. It makes the best decision it possibly could have made: it creates episodes for all the nerds out there.\\n\r\nYou watch wrestling? There's an episode about wrestling.\\n\r\nYou watch gaming tournaments? There's an episode about a gaming tournament.\\n\r\nYou watch porn? There's an episode about porn.\\n\r\nYes, I'm serious.\\n\r\nWhile the first episode is only a poor exposition, because it gives the impression of it being just an ecchi show, everything past that is pure madness. It doesn't have only one thing it uses, it has multiple ones that it completely overblows. And that's fun! Yes, it's the same formula over and over, the team meets someone who later turns out to be a Bugged One that they defeat by stripping him/her, but it manages to keep it fresh. You may think that its episodic nature will ruin the feeling of continuity or that the lack of connection could just turn it into a boring show that only has cool moments. Worry not, the cast is here to help.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just as ridiculous and fickle as the plot. Tamotsu jumps from being a hipster to being a normie to being a mainstream fag at any convenient point. It's not because he is written poorly, but because he lives in freaking Akiba. You can find everything there, and so he tries all of it out one by one. You can say that he has an attention span of a dog. He's honestly a great main character for the series, easily relatable and constantly changing to be compatible with the current topic. Haven't you ever went through a phase in your life? That chunk of your precious time that you spent on only one type of entertainment over a certain period of your existence, like wrestling, gaming and such. Tamotsu is the embodiment of that, it's just because of the situation he found himself in, he changes his interests more often.\\n\r\nThe only character that could come close to  Tamotsu in terms of sudden changing is Arisa Ahokainen. She traveled all over the world and experienced many different things, but decided to roll with the squad in Akiba. This busty blonde from Finland is more of a companion than anything else, but she does have several unique features. She cosplays at all times, changing her clothes multiple times throughout an episode, her voice is very high pitched and her energy is endless.\\n\r\nThe other two group members are Mayonaka, who's just a tomboy with a baseball bat, and Niwaka, who ends up being a damsel in distress a bit too much. There's seriously not much to say about them, though their characters do progress and become more likable as time goes on.\\n\r\nThe main cast works really well off of each other, for example Tamotsu's and Arisa's clumsiness contrasts with Mayo's sense of duty. It's used in a pretty simple way: When a specific reaction seems to be the best one, the characters that can pull that expression off step up to the spotlight. It works rather well and gives off a feeling of good character rotation and solid comedic timing.\\n\r\nThe minor characters and the episodic ones are a bit stretched out, but they are mostly pushed to the sidelines to let the main cast take the center stage. They're rather forgettable, but I think that's mostly because of the fact that they're quickly replaced and the show doesn't stop to let you drill them into your memory. Overall though, the cast does a solid job at making me want to see their misadventures continue.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the more technical aspects, this show is fair. Some of you who only saw the first three episodes may look at this and think \"This guy's an idiot\" and well.... you may be somewhat right. Akiba's Trip looks flat out ugly at some moments. Some movement, especially during a couple of action scenes, feel like characters are actually blobs, certain camera angles make them look like abominations and overall the art style looks silly. Everything I just mentioned I was able to spot within the first two episodes, however, this series did grow on me. The color pallet is probably as good as it could be, even if blue dominates it, there are so many contrasting elements that each scene is pleasing to the eye. The animation gets more exciting and sudden, which is a good thing. Action scenes include several strong sakuga moments, even if a bit short. All that really fits with the chaotic and explosive feeling the plot and characters give off. That's not to say it isn't flawed past the first episodes. The character designs are a bit too normal at times or way too out there at others (the main cast is designed very well though) and the CGI crowds tend to break the immersion. The music also works in the series' favor, actually, it's probably one of the best parts of the anime. It's consistently good and fitting and has several good themes that I would gladly listen to on their own. I would assume it comes from the games, which could explain why the quality of the tracks is so good.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is rather simple, you probably heard similar ones, but it's catchy, fiery, the music fits the visuals exceptionally well and it made me ready for each episode with the right deal of excitement. It's solid. The idea for the ED's is really damn good though. Once again, the action takes place in Akiba, so what better way to end an episode than to showcase some up and coming singers or groups? Each episode has a different song, performed by a different J-Pop artist or an idol group. I can't say more than one or two stuck in my mind for longer than a second, but nonetheless this idea fits the theme of the series perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nMy relationship with Akiba's Trip is that of a love-hate one. I can easily say that it was enjoyable as much as it could be. It was able to sell me on its story and characters despite me having extremely negative things to say about it after the first episodes. I am pretty sure this will end up being a disappointed to a lot of viewers. It's visual style is a big turn-off straight off the bat and the rest of it doesn't seem promising enough to continue. However, this series does evolve and starts taking clearer direction the more time it gets, especially as a weekly, bombastic series that one could watch after a long day of work or studying, at least it was so for me. It's definitely not one that works well for binging, but as an episodic one that you can watch every once in a while it may prove to be a surprise hit. With that in mind, I fully recommend Akiba's Trip The Animation. It's a fun bunch of episodes that may even be considered as longer skits. Comedy can't appeal to everyone, but when it's an overblown parody catered to otakus, I'm sure some will find it enjoyable. Expect a lot of fanservice too. That's how this show rolls, and if you can't accept that at the start, you won't get anything out of it.

Thank you for your time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion. I recommend you to develop you own.",

            "content": "I gave this anime a chance for several reasons.\r\nOne is that the art style stood out to me.  I liked the colors even just on the picture representing the anime.  Actually I think the art is the best thing about this anime.\r\nThe second is that the premise seemed light and funny despite its ecchi-ness.  I don't respect fanservice... and naturally the less of it an anime has, the more I respect that anime.  Despite that, it doesn't turn me off to a show.  I tolerate it and even sometimes enjoy it... like we all do.  (There's two kinds ofpeople who watch anime: people who occasionally enjoy fanservice and liars).  [That's a half joke.  Don't get all triggered on me].\\n\\n\r\nANYWAYS\\n\\n\r\nThis anime did something to me that I hate: A tonal shift immediately after the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nI went into this anime with pretty much 0 expectations, thinking it to be a simple, silly, goofy anime that I could stop watching when I picked my next 'good' anime to watch.  The first episode however, despite the comedy, was fairly dark.  Combat was well animated (I think.  Sometimes less is more if you ask me.)  And there was more blood than I expected.  Also more intimacy than I expected with, actually, a fairly decent meeting of lips as far as anime goes.  Even the fanservice had some plot significance.  It all came together and made me interested to see where the story went.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then they did nothing with it.  The story has not progressed in 8 episodes, and after teasing me with the tone of the first episode, it immediately became the silly goofy worthless kind of anime that I had expected it to be, each episode becoming harder to get through.  And yes, I binged the 8 episodes (out at the time of this review) in 2 nights, hoping that the tone of the first episode was foreshadowing a darker second half.  Now, seeing as I can't seem to find an intended episode count anywhere I suppose it could be longer... but my guess is that they're going for a 10-12 episode anime, which we are quite passed the halfway point of.  That makes me sad.\\n\\n\r\nI did know, however, that my hope for a dark twist was probably in vain.  As much as the first episode had good interesting 'darker' moments, there was a lot of silliness there too.  I probably would have enjoyed the what I've seen a little better if I hadn't raised my expectations.  Emphasis on 'probably.'\\n\\n\r\nBottom line is, this anime isn't that good, and it's not meant to be, and they knew it wasn't meant to be when they made it, and a part of me respects that, but not enough to give it a good rating.",

            "content": "Another game turned anime adaptation, this better not have the video game adaptation curse because LA already had enough of shitty video game anime adaptations from 2016!!!...\r\n\r\nIt's different in it's own quirky way...\r\nFor it's introductory episode, Akiba's Trip does bring us the setting as well as how Electric Mayonnaise gets formed as well as the threat of the Bugged Ones and how to defeat them. After that?, it has an episodic format where a new Bugged One threat appears, Electric Mayonnaise stumbles or is directly influenced by the new fad of Akihabara or Tamotsu Denkigai voiced by Haruki Ishiya's latest craze todefeat the Bugged Ones. Akiba's Trip using it's episodic format looks into the otaku subcultures through this setting, from fighting games, computer parts, card games, anime figures, idols, audiophiles and even pro-wrestling!. How Akiba's Trip look at these topics are wide ranging from knowing A LOT about it or just wanting to parody it using it's otaku subcultures as a foundation.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is a flaw to all this is that because of it's episodic format, the main cast consisting of Tamotsu, Niwaka Denkigai voiced by Marika Kouno, Tamotsu's little sister, Arisa Ahokainen voiced by Yuki Nagaku a die-hard cosplayer and local tank of Electric Mayonnaise and Matome Mayonaka voiced by Rie Takahashi, the one who introduced Tamotsu and the rest of the cast to the threat of the Bugged Ones and love interest of Tamotsu though she's incredibly tsundere shy about it. The flaw is that there isn't much character development to the main cast as it's more about the episode looking at Tamotsu's latest craze or otaku subculture fad than it's character and that's where Akiba's Trip lacked heavily (Niwaka being the best example of this as she's more of a satellite character than anything until she gets focus later on). The defense to all this is that Electric Mayonnaise as a group does develop as a team in fighting the Bugged One of the week only solidifying their teamwork and we learn a bit more about Arisa to Tamotsu and Niwaka's sibling relationship (no it's not incest trust LA) to about Matome by the final arc but her a bit later. Even the Bugged Ones themselves are stereotypically hammy evil though there are some red herrings making the REAL Bugged Ones even more lacking and one-hit strip kills at times just to close the episode off. Akiba's Trip seems more to be focusing on it's otaku culture in it's forefront with it's characters on the background until they need development and LA doesn't fault the anime that much for that as the main cast DOES get developed somewhat cleverly over the course of the anime. LA's favourite character was at first Matome then quickly became a tie between Matome and Arisa, but ultimately it went back to Matome.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one saving grace to Akiba's Trip to it however, is that the animation is BOMBASTIC even outside it's \"battles\"...allowing Gonzo to go all over the place, from purposefully low quality to the reference-crazy detail as hell moments to battles it gets into. LA just loves when Akiba's Trip and by extension Gonzo going reference and meta-crazy and knowing how self-aware it is which can be another saving grace to Akiba's Trip.\\n\\n\r\nHmmmm...that voice cast seems familiar...ohh right, Marika Kouno, Yuki Nagaku and Rie Takahashi were all from Sore ga Seiyuu!...nice Gonzo bringing up another of your titles, the three even sing the OP and some of the ED's! *ahem* with it's voice cast, LA would say that Yuki Nagaku has very unique vocals and was a hoot to hear with her semi-Japanese cadence, Marika Kouno as Niwaka feels like she is projecting Rin Kohana from Sore ga Seiyuu and Rie Takahashi is voicing her typical vocals. Haruki Ishiya sounds very much like he was having a blast voicing Tamotsu and the impressive minor cast voice cast was GREAT to have as well. \\n\\n\r\nFor an anime named Akiba' STrip, the fanservice if anything is surprisingly light, sure there are the expected bra's and panties and occasional panty shots and the one-strip kill shots, but the anime doesn't focus on that all due to the meta-self aware nature of Akiba's Trip directing, the fanservice feels more like an afterthought that trying to deliberately leer at it's fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nThe \"final arc\" of Akiba's Trip if anything does make the anime bit better for those people who wants anime with a bit more of an impactful and cohesive plot and this really puts the Electric Mayonnaise gang to it's max tension though the \"drama\" is given more as a detour than any actual drama and give much needed factor towards Matome as a character and her connection to the main villain of the series. A flaw to this is it's episodic otaku subculture element disappears however it should be noted that the \"bigger picture\" a la major villain of the anime plotline was touched upon A LOT during the episodic format but nonetheless, even with all these elements of the build up to character development to it's otaku subculture elements disappearing, the ending still brought back it's wacky own flavour it had during the episodic format with little details amongst the final arc of the anime and by that LA means that the final episode is essentially a literal FINAL DUNGEON with the BIG BOSS at the end! and it went in a blaze of glory on how the ending was executed and although it had allegories of otaku's nature and how parents look at them and it still kept it's bombastic atmosphere by the end of it and LA will praise this kind of ending and how it was handled.\\n\\n\r\nAkiba's Trip: The Animation being a very self-aware \"Bugged Ones\" of the week looking at the subculture of otaku's makes this video game anime adaptation rather a different breed of adaptation to say the least. It has it's flaws sure, but it's bombastic and self-aware nature and the comedy coming from that makes this anime adaptation either a guilty pleasure for LA or a very good self-aware parody anime about otaku subculture...nonetheless Akiba's Trip: The Animation for LA is an honest to god guilty pleasure for Winter 2017 for LA...flaws and all!",

            "content": "This will be my first review, I believe. Normally I wouldn't bother for a series like this, however I felt it was important to try and point out some of the major issues that many people simply haven't addressed in reviews thus far.\r\nFirst of all, I have seen two major 'sides' when it comes to debate on this series. There is the side that argues that it fails on account of being an Akiba's Trip anime without referring back to the games from which it gets its lineage. Secondly, there's the camp that argues that the anime fails as a series in a traditional sense,through fault of its characters, overall story and other such things. I'm of the belief that both camps are completely incorrect.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, Akiba's Trip is not a traditional anime, nor is it relying on the success of the game franchise it hails from. In fact, I believe that it succeeds for the same reason that the game it hails from succeeded in the first place. This anime is a celebration of otaku culture and Akiba itself. As a result, it casts aside expected conventions of a solid story structure, engaging characters and even its own plot to simply deliver on its purpose of celebrating the electric town of Akihabara.\\n\\n\r\nHow have I gathered this? Well, firstly I'd point to the story structure. While the first episodes do indeed set up a narrative, a villain and a purported structure, the rest of the series proves that it has no intention on following through with this as would be expected. Instead, each episode is almost entirely self-contained, focusing on a specific aspect of otaku culture and Akihabara life in general. One episode it may be idols, another it's military otaku, yet another it's radio otaku. The focus is not on the characters or the story in these moments. It's to serve as a grand celebration of the reality it's taking inspiration from.\\n\\n\r\nI have been to Akihabara several times and I should emphasize that the enjoyment of this series is magnified many times when you have first-hand experience. Many, if not all of the buildings seen are real buildings. The occurrences within the 'plot' are exaggerations of daily life within those buildings and on those streets. In this regard, I'd almost say that this series wasn't even made for a wider audience. Many of the references and much of the humor seems to be directed specifically at people who frequent Akiba or are at least major otaku themselves. \\n\\n\r\nThe humor is irreverent. Of course it is, why wouldn't it be? The story is already extremely silly on its most basic foundation, so it only seems natural that the actual gags would be even sillier. The humor is built very solidly on in-jokes that only those within the wider otaku community would be able to appreciate. This furthers my assertion that this series was never intended for a wide audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is admittedly rather sub-par. Sometimes improved on by impressive character design and facial expressions, however the solid colour schemes, lack of movement and backgrounds that at times are indisputably just augmented photographs are hard to simply let-slide each and every time. I do however feel that certain elements of this are worth dismissing. As I have stated before, I feel this anime was never created with the intention of reaching a wide audience. I suspect that the budget was very low from the outset and that talented staff members from the studio were likely relegated to different shows. As it stands however, the art and animation is certainly nothing special and at times can be a let-down.\\n\\n\r\nAn aspect in stark contrast is the sound design. The voice actors perform a serviceable job, with some notable exceptions being quite striking and impressive to boot. However the key is the music. Both background music which is at times directly lifted from the games to provide a cheerful and effective mood, as well as the variety of songs used at the end of each episode which I would suspect are likely a method of improving a lackluster budget. In any case, all failures are forgiven in the face of the monotone idol from the idol episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mixed bag indeed. The protagonist himself is frankly a delight as a result of how blatant he is in his lack of interest for just about every event of the story. Many episodes occur largely as a result of him indulging in his otaku desires and having them taken to a cartoonish extent. In the context of this show, I find it appropriate. It touches on the mindset of particular otaku communities rather well and at times, it feels as though he himself is a representation of Akihabara. The supporting cast are far more mixed, with segway-loli being hilarious in her very few scenes and miss Moi Moi being a constant barrel of fun with constant costume changes and contrived backstories. The only elements where this feels somewhat hurt is in the other two female leads, who often seem to take too much of a back-seat and lack personality themselves.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found this an extremely enjoyable series, especially in the context of what I believe it was trying to achieve. It's not a perfect series. Certainly not. If rated against other shows to try and live up to their standards, it would fall flat on many fronts. However if other shows attempted to live up to its specific standards, I can see it quite easily blowing many of them out of the water.\\n\\n\r\nNot the best series of this season by a long-shot. However in terms of raw enjoyment and appreciation for what it attempted to set out to achieve, I feel it would be doing the series a disservice to rate it below an 8. In its own particular playing field, I feel it knocked it out of the park. Here's hoping the last few episodes don't make me eat my words.",

            "content": "First, do not look at my rating/s. It is strictly based on enjoyment. I refuse to be a person who looks for flaws and assumptions only to ruin his enjoyment and memories of shows. And not to mention ruin the chances for others to pick a show just because someone trusted a stranger instead of them self.\r\nThis review's purpose is to write how I experienced the show, what I remember specifically and what I liked and to spread positivity.\r\nIf your overall experience is great, then changing something will only change the overall feeling. Which is not necessarily guaranteed to be a good thing as somepeople might think. Something is what it is and that's why your overall experience was great. You are lying to yourself if you think you really want something changed.\\n\\n\r\n- What especially stuck with me during this show is the art, sound and how every factor that makes a show in general was executed during fight scenes. Just like with any show I don't think you get much grasp of the director's and the cinematographers (if they have the 2nd in anime development, in any case I mean a person with similar jobs during development) work during common scenes. Since this is a comedy and action you can expect it during action scenes and eventually scenes with an outburst of comedy, such an outburst that rivals movement/action scenes. Meaning that there is enough going on that it can feel like an action (as happenings) scene even without the real action (as action). During those instances you tend to notice directing. It all depends on the individual of course. You all perceive something differently and with more intensity. Worth to note: still scenes (moments) and common scenes aren't the same.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the fight scenes everything moves so smoothly and makes you follow. Whether or not they had innovative animation techniques (I refuse to look back in depth just to nitpick on myself) the fight scenes will most definitely give you the feeling that there's a lot of creative work done on them. And with the art style we have, the animation during fight scenes is matching. Or rather the art style makes the animation look even better.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have to mention the sound. The opening is one of the best I've heard and has a lot of replay value and gives you energy. The ost during the show also did not disappoint. \\n\\n\r\nThe show handles it's surroundings or backgrounds greatly, as the composition of the scene, the characters involved and the feeling of how said scene continually keeps to get your attention so deep on what actually is the point of the scene, it all is mixed in perfectly to keep your focus on what is intended.\\n\\n\r\nThe usage of colors in the show create the overall and happy feeling. An excellent match for the comedy parts of our characters. The character's designs are memorable and the color difference even helps them with that. For sure is a certain character the comic relief, char name spoiler inbound, warning you again, I mean our ari even though the show is cheerful anyway. However all the characters are likeable just like that. And the voices are made for them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show gave me everything I love about, well, shows with a happy and sunny vibe. And with my next sentence I also have to mention that it does capture the feeling of a game. (It's not necessarily an adaption, as It seems the characters are different.) What I mean is it's noticeable that it works as a game and an anime (and other stuff) so that's a thumb up.\\n\\n\r\nI need to get a physical copy of the game sometime.",

            "content": "Hey there, this is my first review and I would like to do it to express myself and let people know if this is the kind of anime that you would like to watch.\r\nFirst, Akiba's Trip The Animation is not related to the game's story, this means that you will not see the main characters of the game and their development along with the story of it but a whole new cast and a new story instead.\r\nThe reason why this anime caught my attention was because of the name of the game, but I was slighty disappointed when I saw that it wasn't related toit, although I changed my mind after the first episodes and a very specific one (avoiding to spoil) that made me hook up with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo lets begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory: As mentioned before, don't expect the game's development here but hey, don't let appearances fool you, this doesn't mean that it will automatically become bad or mediocre, the approach of this one is actually more of a parodic style and.. I like it, I'm having fun with it laughing a lot with certain episodes and enjoying the rest of them.\\n\r\nEach episode is pretty much independent, they have their own setup that doesn't follow a straight line with the plot, kinda like a cartoon so if you're a viewer that doesn't like these stuff and want instead something else with a story development I don't suggest this to you, but if you don't mind that or you're interested in it, you'll have some fun times out there!\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't solid, but the anime can talk by itself with its episodes.\\n\r\n6.4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: I like the art, but I think it's just something fine. There are some aspects of it that I like that are unique used in a comedic way and the character design is good-looking.\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing much to say here. I like the opening and the seiyuus are good, the sound effects aren't surprising but they're fine, no complaints here.\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I personally find the characters here pretty appealing and have their own personalities well-built. You won't find them flat, generic or lacking something.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is the strongest point of the anime in my opinion, because \\n\r\nwhat it really matters is how you interpret something, even if it's not the greatest thing in the world, you can make it better in your own way. You can enjoy this anime even if it doesn't have the best story or anything similar as long as it is done well.\\n\\n\r\nI have been enjoying this anime with each episode.\\n\r\n7.1/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's a good anime, not the best one out there but I feel that it's pretty unique and it defends well by itself, you'll have fun with the characters and the things they do during the episodes, each episode having a different mini-plot, and plenty of other things.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here is the last score\\n\r\n7/10",

Matome well she one of the female leads and the original defender of akiba she is a tough chick with Tamotsu and also defending akiba she does get angry a good few times at Tamotsu but that's it otherwise she a pretty tough but also nice girl. Arisa is another female lead she is a pretty good fighter aswell not a bugged on but she can kick some butt she is also kinda like Tamotsu that he is a Otaku at heart (well maybe not at heart as him but close) otherwise a pretty good and decent character overall. Niwaka is the sister to Tamotsu and the last female lead in the anime honestly she cant really fight or do anything really so there just to help them with other stuff also she does like her brother (not like incest love btw) otherwise a decent character and a nice and kind one at that. Tasujin is a supporting character and is a scientist to the there group Electric mayonnaise she would basically provide stuff on to help them battle the bugged ones a decent character overall.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Things that i liked: the comedy was here and there it took awhile for the comedy to really get me but later on it was good and the action was damn good for the most part and the characters were all really well done for the most part. Things that i didn't like: again the comedy to was here and there it really to me AWHILE for it to actually get me to laugh out loud if anything most of the anime was like me smiling also that one of the characters Arisa i felt was kinda here just for the fan service (also sorry for spoiler shes never a bugged one) so yeah and also every time she would say moi or whatever it was she said was kinda annoying i could see people not liking her.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: it was hard for me to give this a 7 or a 8 or even a 7.5 but in the end i just went with a 8 i think for me the comedy got better for sure as the anime went along and that the action was damn well done and also i loved most of the characters that made this anime really well done i would recommend this anime",

            "content": "Great. I like myself a good Ecchi anime. \r\nI find it pretty cool and interesting how the anime is set in a modern, colourful society. I also like how the plot has superhuman powers but I feel like the technology used is a bit too unrealistic for the setting. The art is stunningly amazing and the video/animation quality is great, as well as having eye popping colours (and characters, which I'll explain later).\r\nI really like how the show starts and has fast paced and peppy songs. I'm kind of into that, but it would be a little better if they had subtitles for the songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are pretty cool, with interesting personalities and colourful hair, as well as a couple of cool and...busty people *Cough, Arisa cough*. The fight scenes are awesome and some are just downright spectacular, with some casual moments to break the ice. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a pretty great anime. Too bad it only has 1 season. Hoping for another season!  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So I was originally gonna pass up this anime, I figured it was just another cookie cutter anime and really didn't think I would enjoy it. Optimistically I thought I might get a small amount of enjoyment out of it, but I never expected that I would have an absolute blast!\r\nAkiba's Trip is an anime that knows exactly what it is, what it wants to be, and is completely unapologetic about all of it. It knows that its a fan service-y anime and that means it will lose a lot on depth, but because of that it never allows itself to take itself too seriously.\r\nDespitethis the anime manages to pull off some damn fine comedy, constructs stories that are interesting for a 'villain-of-the-week scenario', and really absorb you into the world of Akiba. Combined with a good cast of characters whom all compliment one another in some way it's a wild ride right from episode 1. \\n\\n\r\nFair warning, there may be some spoilers in these later sections, the point of the above summary is to go over the general idea of what I'll cover in detail later.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThe story is NOTHING to be impressed about, it has a very basic premise. Simply put it's 'oh look bad guys doing bad guy things watch the good guys do good guy things' with the added 'if you get stripped you lose' bit at the end. It is every bit as ridiculous as that sounds, but that's ok. Like I said this anime never takes itself too seriously, it knows what it is and what it wants to be and isn't interested in playing up ANY level of melodrama. It's only goal is to get a few laughs and it accomplishes that which is why I rate it so highly because the story effectively exists in service OF that comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nAgain, the art itself isn't super impressive and the animation is just the 'yup that's anime' level of animation. What REALLY sells this art is the characters. You can tell based off every character you meet that the creative team really ran with the idea that hair color is indicative of whether someone is a Bugged One as a lot of these hairstyles are pretty imaginative. Especially in the main cast whom all seem to function well as a whole, artistically speaking. Unfortunately, animation is a real big deal to me so I can't really rate it too highly. However, the fact that the characters be they side or main were all fun to just look at speaks volumes to the care that went into crafting them. In my opinion at least.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe sound direction was pretty on point in regards to SFX. I like my SFX to be realistic and the show stays true to that for the most part, and I especially liked the sound effect for when a Bugged One was disrobed really sold that feeling of 'whoohoo they did it!' The music choice, much like everything else, was ok. Nothing really wrong with it, nothing really great about it. What's more important than that was the timing, good sound direction can turn almost anything into something great and this show provides a really standard example of that. A general rule is that the music should never lie to the audience, if its a good moment then the music should reflect that. If the situation is dire again, the music should reflect that. The music choice coupled with the timing of delivery really sold those situations perfectly and it works well with this anime. Again, it's still nothing spectacular. But I rate it highly because the sound direction made me notice things that this wasn't just another lazy anime, someone really put effort in and I can appreciate that.\\n\\n\r\nComedy: 9\\n\r\nThis is a special category that I'm adding in here because it deserves this recognition. It's really interesting how comedy ISN'T one of the genres used to describe this anime because in my opinion the comedy is the shining star of this anime. The action scenes are ok, nothing fantastic. While the setting creates a 'supernatural' feel sure, it doesn't steal the show. And yea, the fan service is fairly abundant (which while being abundant I must say it was at least tasteful and not just blatantly shoe-horned in) but fan service has never made an anime great it just gives it sex appeal so it can sell well. No, the COMEDY is where this anime stands in the limelight. There is a rule of thumb about comedy that I adore when speaking in regards to skit comedy, 'When you put a crazy individual in a world of normal people, or put a normal person in a world of crazy people, that's where the comedy happens.' and this anime EXEMPLIFIES this. It took me a couple episodes to realize, but in this anime YOU are that normal person. YOU are the one in the crazy world because everyone in this show is NUCKING FUTS! I would go so far as to say that the comedy in this anime could even stand up to the likes of konosuba, which was also brilliant with it's comedy. It's the fact that this anime blatantly and unabashedly goes for the most outlandish, far left field idea they can go for and  they make that WORK. By episode 3, I found myself on the edge of my seat just excited to find out what wacky and zany adventures these idiots were gonna find themselves in next. No, the comedy is the true star of this show even if it wasn't meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nSo there you have it. This show manages to combine mediocrity with greatness in various areas, especially with its comedy. The end result is a world you can get absorbed in, characters you can care about, and good times that will always manage a laugh out of you. An exciting adventure, and a conclusive and satisfying ending with a neat little cliffhanger for a potential second season (Fingers VERY much crossed). So in short, top recommend.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\nWatch it, it's worth it.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nTo me this was definitely a hidden and underrated gem of the 2017 winter season because this was one fun and hilarious ride.\r\nThe story focuses on Tamotsu and his sister Niwaka who go to Akiba to enjoy all it's Otaku brilliance, but they get attacked by creatures called Bugged ones, they run into Matome who is defending Akiba from this threat and also with the help of Arisa they create a team to defend this Otaku paradise from this new monstrous threat.\r\nYou gotta love a story when it doesn't take itself seriously which is what this show does even though it's about agroup of teens defending a section of town from weird monsters I was surprised to see how well this show worked because I can definitely say it was one funny ride because no matter how dangerous the threat got these group of characters never really got serious about it and seeing shows take the usual cliche that you see in a lot of other anime's and use them as jokes was a delight to see, not only that seeing this group of characters defeat the threat was also really funny like a video game battle, a eating competition and even a card game too. It was also full of references to many other anime's which was great to see the show make fun of because it worked really well with what was happening in many of the situations that happened in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were very likeable and funny Tamotsu is pretty much a big Otaku, but he isn't stupid he actually knows quite a lot of things like at some point his knowledge of electronics actually saved the day plus his none serious and lazy attitude was also really funny and different for once since you don't really see that many male MC's with this personality, but when the time called he can be a kind and protective person depending on what the reason is. Matome is a Tsundere that finally is really likeable true she does hit Tamotsu and makes him do patrols for the Bugged ones, but she actually has a fun personality once you get to know her and even at times she wasn't being serious which shows she can be pretty lose and damn can she eat a lot of food. Arisa is another one of those characters that has the sweet and energetic personality which is always a win for me, but she has a lot of surprises in store like she has a very complex life and is actually very smart plus the funniest aspect of her character is that she always end's up in a different costume well of course she's a cosplayer, but the outfit's she wore sometimes were just hilarious because they seemed so out of place. Niwaka is difficult to decipher mainly because she isn't in some episodes and can't fight against the enemies because she doesn't have powers, but she felt likeable anyway because she didn't do anything to annoy and there were some scenes that she did something that was actually funny.\\n\r\nThe other supporting characters like the Professor who always travelled on her Segway and couldn't even fit in her lab Coat and the many villains were actually pretty good and it was hilarious seeing how over the top the villains were and how easy they were to defeat was also a funny site too.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle felt similar to Kill la Kill not the way the characters were made, but how it was used because a lot of the scenes where someone was being sarcastic or being over the top just reminded me of that show plus for some reason characters like Kage-san just reminded me of lego because their face's were so expressionless just like the lego faces.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was just fantastic there were cliches like the Deus ex Machina cliche that were used as jokes plus there was were a few 4th wall breaks which were pretty funny too, but the characters are what made the show really funny because of their none serious attitude my smile hardly disappeared because it was that funny to watch and the fact that ripping people's clothes off just to defeat also reminded me of High School DxD and to me that's always a good thing. The action though short was pretty fun I liked Tamotsu and Matome's power's and how Tamotsu gained these powers was actually quite surprising although I think I've seen it somewhere before.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a friggin hilarious show if you want something that sorta works like Kill la Kill with it's comedy then you're definitely in for something epically amazing.",

            "content": "Ah, Akihabara. Otaku center of the world. Filled to the brim with anime, manga, video games, computer goods, maid caf\u00e9s, and vampires. \r\nAkiba's Trip The Animation feels like a love letter to Akiba and every nerdy interest you can think of. Is it a masterful work of writing? No. Is it thought provoking? No. Is it enjoyable? I'd like to think so. Isn't that why we watch anime? To enjoy ourselves?\r\nThe premise is quite simple. Akiba has been overrun by vampires known as \"Bugged Ones\" and the only way to defeat them is to strip them of their clothes and expose them to sunlight. Dependingon your tolerance for fan service there's your indication as to whether or not you should bother starting the show. However, for those coming in because they're thinking the show will have the same amount of fan service as Prison School for example, you'll be disappointed as the fan service is quite minimal considering the premise of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's strongest asset in my eyes is how much heart it feels went into the show. As previously mentioned the show is a love letter to Akiba and every nerdy interest you can think of. Computers, card games, audiophiles, Street Fighter, wrestling, and more. Every episode is an affectionate parody of these subcultures and is both the show's biggest strength and weakness. If you're familiar with what they happen to be parodying that episode you will enjoy yourself immensely, but if not, you might feel like you're being left out of the joke. This results in each episode being quite hit or miss. Not every episode will be a hit, but when they are, my God do they hit.\\n\\n\r\nThis love and passion for these interests leads to a payoff when it comes to the show's comedy. The accuracy of the wrestling tropes. A person's descent into becoming an audiophile. How a card game looks for people who know what's going on vs people who don't know a thing about the game. They know what will make people who enjoy these interests laugh and they make good use of that knowledge. The show knows how stupid it is and revels in by going completely over the top whenever possible. It's not afraid to poke fun at itself either by occasionally referencing various characteristics of the show itself. It's all comedic gold.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't particularly complex and developed, but would you expect anything different? That's not to say they\u2019re walking tropes however. Tamotsu escapes being a bland nerd MC and Arisa shows off her loyalty when faced with an important decision. It's not much, but it's something. But frankly in a show like this the development and complexity of the characters isn't important. What is important however is how likable they are. The group is full of energy and enthusiasm when the times are good, and when push comes to shove they'll go out of their way to show how much they care about each other.\\n\\n\r\nCould I talk about the art or the sound? Sure, probably. But frankly they're not remarkably good or bad enough to justifying writing about and I don't see a point in telling you something is completely average just for the sake of padding out the amount of words in this review.\\n\\n\r\nFor me Akiba's Trip has been the surprise of the season and was a complete joy to watch. The show knew what it wanted to achieve and passed with flying colours. It's goofy, it's fun, it's energetic, it's hilarious, it's Akiba's Trip.",

It questions your core values, your beliefs and makes you wonder will we ever see another anime like this. For some it can leave an empty void making you wonder what will you watch next.\r\nBut enough about incredible shows like Steins;Gate and Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Im sadly here to review Akiba's Trip.\r\nI would like for everyone to remember at this point that a Review involves expressing ones opinion. If you don't like it?

Now when you read that your first thought is most likely \"I am sure I didn't tick R18?\" or \"Have I ended up on the weird part of the internet again?\". Sadly no, otherwise I would of closed the browser and wouldn't have lost a piece of my soul...... I am fairly certain a 4 year old could create a better basis than this show has. \\n\r\nBefore the keyboard defenders type \"But you rated this higher than Akibas Trip!\" or \"If you don't like ecchi why are you watching?\", I don't know a sad curiousity at how ludicrously awful something can get? And clearly I also have no life.\\n\r\nThe comedy throughout the entirety of this show feels so forced it's so awkward to watch.......I can't really give the story rating because is ripping off clothes really an anime story? It's just failed soft core pornography. \\n\r\nDid the studio think they struck gold with this concept? \"Oh yay stripping clothes off people to win. Sure to give us lots of money!\" . Oh wait anime is either just for kids or hentai right? Course they thought that. Imagine going 25 years as studio and this is how you celebrate.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters Non-Existent/10 -\\n\\n\r\nOh yay! Characters......I honestly reckon placing cones or cardboard cutouts of characters in place of the ones in this show would provide as much to the story. It would get rid of the fan service too. Infact lets just put cute puppies in place instead? Least then i can go awww cute....\\n\\n\r\nArt 1/10 -\\n\\n\r\nOh boy the art! This is where the show.....\"shines\" . I think the studio had the same thoughts as me when it came to the art. They made a few characters correctly then got bored, realised they were wasting away with an awful show and just randomly drew characters like a spoiled child who had enough of his expensive toy. It reached the stage where I honestly felt like they were attempting to troll people watching it got that bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound 2/10 - \\n\\n\r\nIt's got more than a 1 out of 10! Thank you so much EARPHONES.....You were the hero we needed, but maybe the one we didn't deserve for doing an opening that for 1 minute 30 seconds, I embraced the wonder of thinking I was watching something interesting. Sadly after the opening I came crashing down to reality faster than , realising the music for this is very poor.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment ?/10 -\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment on this show depends on one thing....Whether you watch alone or in a group. If you want in a group, suffering together with someone will make the pain more bearable. Watching alone is something I do not recommend.......\\n\\n\r\nConclusion -\\n\\n\r\nFun fact the studio that did Akiba's Trip also did Welcome to the N.H.K and Afro Samurai. Oh the mighty have fallen to quote the Dark Knight himself \"You either die a hero, or live long enough to become the villian.\" If you plan on watching Akiba's Trip, I recommend instead you go find yourself a great wall (not Trumps.....But a wall) , and watch that instead. I can tell you for certain, its more enteraining.",

I don't know about the game tho, but the anime is good enough to make me kept watching 'til the end. It's a bit early for me to review this (since there's only 4 episodes out at the time I'm writing this) but since another users have reviewed this, yea.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nVery dumb. In Akiba, there's something called Bugged Ones who possess people living around there to make them evil. To make them back to their \"previous\" side, themain heroes Tamotsu (not Mokkun from Boku no Pico, lol) and the red-haired girl should undress them. Then Tamotsu got interested for something like idols (ep 3) and radios (ep 4). He even managed to buy everything related to it, with a really high price. Because of his interest, he got to met some Bugged Ones. (like in the pool of ep 3)\\n\\n\r\nPretty dumb, right? Since almost every Bugged Ones are girl, you know what's going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the colors and the character design. The animation is ok, it goes well with the budget. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, ED, and the OST were forgettable. I can't even remember a single bit of the OP. The voice acting is nice tho.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nForgettable cast. I only remember Tamotsu because his name sounds like Mokkun from BnP, the rest were forgettable. There is a fanservice generator (the yellow-haired girl), Tamotsu's sister, and a red-haired girl who managed to kiss Tamotsu. Also, a professor with a really long name. After writing that, I realized that's a pretty generic cast.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBecause I don't mind the ecchi part, I really enjoyed this. For those who hate ecchi, you wouldn't enjoyed this to it's maximum.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nPass if you hate fanservice/ecchi, watch if you dont care and need your daily dose of another ecchi comedy.",

            "content": "The beautiful thing about comedy is that it's subjective.  It's an extremely wide topic where there're a multitude of ways to go about it, with the main goal being getting those watching or listening to laugh at the end.  So, how does one go about making the ridiculous plot of stripping off peoples' clothes entertaining?  Well, by shoving in references of course.\r\nStory: Akihabara, the place of hopes and dreams is threatened by an unseen threat.  Bugged ones, creatures who lurk in the dark, seek to take over the otaku capital and rule over it by their own laws and values.In order to beat them, one must expose the people they inhabit to light.  Which means, strip the person to their undergarments.  But never fear, the team consisting of three teenagers and a middle schooler known as Electric Mayonnaise is here!  Oh god, we're still screwed aren't we?\\n\\n\r\nBased on a game series with the same name, Akiba's Trip The Animation takes the gameplay elements of fighting the enemies by stripping them in the Akihabara setting and nothing else.  The entire series is made with completely new characters and features a storyline entirely of one-off episodic adventures that each feature a theme pertaining to either one part of Otaku culture with varying degrees of comedic success.  Each episode acts like its own zany and wacky adventure where the characters always end up fighting a Bugged One as the episode's \"Final Boss\" before returning back to their normal lives and back to the status quo of the series.  \\n\\n\r\nComedy comes in the form of exaggeration and quickly timed jokes that snap in and out as fast as they come.  Due to the show's fast-paced nature, the show never sits on one joke for too long, and keeps going along with the series's momentum to make sure keep the audience engaged to the end.  Though the jokes can be hit or miss both depending on what you're a fan of (since they cover quite a wide variety of topics), and due to how blunt and not subtle everything is, the show is very consistent on how it wants to do things and doesn't falter on what it wants to deliver.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's...all there is.  Packed full of references (both real world and from other series'), Akiba's Trip The Animation is quite simply a sporadic episodic story that uses the exact same storyline for each episode with the only variation being how the story is set up, what each episode's theme is, and what kind of boss they're fighting in the end.  There honestly isn't much to say.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Episodic storyline (depends on your taste)\\n\r\n+/- Blunt, fast-paced comedy (depends on your taste)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Development is very slim for the characters in Akiba's Strip, as the fast-paced comedic nature of the series makes it very difficult for any meaningful development to happen to any of its characters.\\n\\n\r\nElectric Mayonnaise, the titular group of the series, consists of 3 (technically 5?) members.  Mayonaka Matome is a Bugged One who fights to save Akihabara from those that want to take the district for themselves, Tamotsu Denkigai is an otaku turned Bugged One who's more than happy to defend Akihabara and save it from potential doom, and Ahokainen Arisa is a blonde foreigner who's basically a Mary Sue, capable of doing...almost everything (somehow) while cosplaying at every chance she has.  In short, what you see is what you get, as their characters barely change throughout the entire series.  If anything, you get to learn more about their personalities and what they've done, but beyond that, there's nothing much to say.  The other two characters that are technically part of Electric Mayonnaise are Denkigai Niwaka, Tamotsu's little sister, and the professor, who's this tiny girl with a large labcoat on a segeway.  Likewise, what you see is what you get, and like the main trio, are characters that barely change in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bugged Ones that act as villains in the series are quite simple.  They all want to take over Akihabara in some strange yet convoluted manner.  They act more like the episode's final boss that our main characters must fight at the episode's climax more than anything, and have very little beyond their characters beyond their motivation to rule Akiba.  \\n\\n\r\nThere're quite a number of side characters in this show, spanning shokeepers in Akiba, to random characters that get featured in the series once or twice that all add one or two things to the series, culminating to the spastic feel that is this show.  They're not really all that important, but they help spice what's already there.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Defined, entertaining characters\\n\r\n-  Entire cast is one note\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Gonzo, Akiba's Trip boasts a colorful, erratic, and wild artsyle that further compliments the comedy of the series.  Everything from the characters' movements to the the backgrounds and settings is done in a distracting yet entertaining way that compliments the fast paced nature of the series.  Though the show isn't always consistent in this manner.  The background audience for a large majority of the scenes are white figures with smiley faces rather than handdrawn characters, so in this regard, while it fits to the outlandish nature that this show boasts, has hit or miss qualities.  \\n\\n\r\nFanservice is actually quite common in this show, which isn't very surprising when the show is about stripping people naked to save a district in Japan.  Though they're blatant with it, fanservice doesn't actually come all that often, and when it's done, it's not so overglorified that it detracts from the show, though that does happen on occasion.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat I think where the art really exceeds expectations is in some of the real life references that they were able to execute in this show.  First off, they got real life sponsors to make cameos.  Not only that, but in one episode, they were able to get real footage from Street Fighter V of all things in their show.  Now these might not be too difficult to obtain, but the fact that the show was able to get some stuff from real life into the show was in my eyes, pretty cool, especially since most anime that do something like this make their own parody versions to avoid copyright and other legal problems.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Colorful and crazy art to fit the show\\n\r\n+ They legit got Capcom to let them use Street Fighter footage in an episode\\n\r\n-  Laziness in some aspects of the art\\n\\n\r\nSound: As far as sound goes, Akiba's Trip's OP has a high energy beat reflective of that to the series it comes from.  Complete with idol singing and a clear fast beat, the OP is, while isn't all that memorable when not put on repeat, is a nice, fast song to listen to.  EDs in Akiba's Trip vary, as roughly each episode has its own ED with the main draw of all of them being the fact that they're all idol songs.  Similarly, not as memorable as they could be, but still nice listens.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: If you ask me, I'll tell you that Akiba's Trip is a stupid, pointless show that has no value aside from being brainless entertainment.  And that's precisely why I love it.  The show to an extent is self-aware of its own merits and it owns up to them, enhancing its dumb and energetic self to create a fun to watch show that despite not being serious in the slightest, can still be enjoyable.  I liked it, and more important than anything, I enjoyed and had fun with it.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nOh far too much.  The fact that the show was self-aware of its own stupidity made it that much easier to enjoy its random episodes.  In particular, the episode where they talk about card games (I think it was episode 8) was the episode that resonated with me the most.  Not only that, but I like Mayonaka as a character.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, there wasn't really much to hate for me.  I wouldn't call this one of my favorite series, but I had so much fun watching this show that I really had no reason to dislike it at all for any reason.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're into stupid, brainless, and sporadic comedy shows like me, then Akiba Strip is a pretty good pick.  Its episodic nature and completely non-serious demeanor makes this show a fun venture to watch.  Though same with all comedy, it is subjective to a specific audience, so if you're not a fan of in your face humor, then this is probably not the show for you.",

            "content": "If you know the game that this anime is based on you'd expect it to be fanservice city.Well let me warn you, it's not. There is some fanservice here and there and it can be quite nice but this show does not live and die off of fanservice. It actually lives and breathes off of comedy. And it is really good at it.\r\nThe comedy of Akiba's Trip is specialized and really out there. They don't settle with just making a job plain they really go all the way out there and really proclaim it. The fiendish plans range from silly but plausible to WTF HOWDO YOU THINK THIS WOULD WORK!? And it works because each plan is more stupid than the last until it gets to the point of just HOWWW. Everything is exaggerated in this show. The farther into each episode the more exaggerated it gets. It's great to see all the twists and turns that they throw in. Not only do they throw in great exaggerations but they also model it to fit into the realm of okatuness that they are covering for the episode. This acts as a celebration of okatu culture which is a novel idea. Furthermore, it does so in unique and fun ways only adding to the joy of each episode. \\n\\n\r\nAiding the comedy is a great cast of characters. Each one of them feels refreshing and interesting in their own rights. Tomatsu is not the typical self-insert bland MC. He's super dedicated to one thing at a time, and with push himself to do the best at that one task, showing an unusual amount of drive. He's also a complete hipster. His cell phone looks dated. He's always looking up alternative methods to do the okatu habits that he enjoys rather than sticking to the tried and true. This makes him that much more interesting as a character.\\n\\n\r\nHis little sister Niwaka is also great. It's clear that she loves Tomatsu as a sibling but it never goes beyond that. She wants him but she doesn't cling to him, nor is what she does defined by him. She also hangs out more with the other girls that surround Tomatsu as well. Even if she has some of the imouto traits, she's refreshing as she's honest and doesn't define herself only by her onii-chan, rather she feels like a real sister who does care for her brother. (She's also not annoying and she doesn't try to push him into things, she's a pretty cool person.)\\n\\n\r\nMayo and Arisa are also both great characters. They all have likeable charm to them even though Mayo does stay in the tsundere character. (Although she does grow warmer over the span of the show.) Overall the characters all have their own likeable charms while still sticking to a general role. While they aren't the most developed they are refreshing and fun and thusly enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nI'd argue the plot is pretty cool too. The general plot leaves open a hype ending as well as provides the context for the fun of the episodic nature of the show. The comedy is enhanced by the episodic nature because they can keep on making things more extreme which each episode, using the same formula and providing twists to keep it fun. All it all it creates a nice structure for the show to work with, which helps its success.\\n\\n\r\nIt also happens to have some nice sorta unexpected development which I quite enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation I feel like it pretty strong and the art can be quite humorous. Some of the character designs are really well done while others are quite funny in their simplicity. It's enjoyable to see the wide range of character designs they have from cool to cute, to silly simple. The music is also pretty good too. I wouldn't call the OST great but there are some nice memorable tracks which help the show out.\\n\\n\r\nAll and all it's a great show with the ability to provide refreshing characters, a nice plot and development and most importantly a lot of good comedy. And it provides all of this while also giving a supporting message to Okatu culture. A message that we shouldn't judge others for what we do because we're all working off our passion and that's great. I'd recommend it if you'd like a fun and silly show. It's quite a good one. \\n",

            "content": "Akiba's Trip The Animation rekindles a love for Saturday morning cartoons that I'd forgotten I had. One of the last things I expected when going in to the series was a gang of crusaders defending an otherwise helpless city with the help of supernatural abilities and a quirky scientist. Villains are established and defeated on an episode-to-episode basis and, although it's a format that has the potential to run dry, Akiba's Trip read the blueprints well and constructed a very entertaining experience.\r\nIt's true that The Animation differs wildly from the game that it's based off of, but in no way should this be objectively heldagainst the anime. Taking Akiba's Trip and transforming the primary concept into something else entirely should be praised, given how well this task was accomplished by studio Gonzo. The expressive animation shines colorfully throughout the series and translates each character's personality beautifully, especially in the exuberant fight sequences that staple each episode together. The comedy that ties each character interaction and plot development is never flat or dull and, again, I find myself praising Gonzo for their exceptional grasp on the writers' intentions. The fanservice is an integral part of the story, and yet it never feels distracting from the other elements that each episode explores. You'll find yourself engrossed enough in the various situations that Tamotsu and friends stumble into that the disrobing only feels natural and, often times, comical.\\n\\n\r\nIt's difficult to give The Animation anything higher than an 8 when the story itself is inherently restrictive on how far the writers can push their creativity. Our main cast never leaves the city of Akihabara, there is very little focus on any consistent over-arcing antagony (other than the Bugged Ones in general), and room for character development is slim at best. However, the show works very well in the space it has created for itself. I've had an enjoyable trip across the 7 episodes I've seen so far and I would highly recommend Akiba's Trip to anyone who earnestly enjoys anime like Sailor Moon that progress themselves on an episodic basis. Kill La Kill fans should also appreciate the balance Akiba's Trip offers in its fanservice, sakuga, and comedy.",

            "content": "Do you remember that feeling of watching a cartoon as a child? Would you ever want to feel like that again? If the answer is yes, then here you go, this is it but with boobs, asses and even DICKS!\r\n*Disclaimer: Don't expect to see any of that though, it's all censored of course. \r\nThe concept like that has been seen before of course, this is not anything new, but mix that with the intent of showcasing any type of phase that exists in the world and you may just find a winner for some of us in the anime community. With that being said, Ipresent you with Akiba's Trip The Animation, based on the somewhat popular series of games, this is probably the most explosive and bombastic anime of Winter 2017.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole idea of Akiba's Trip is not one that I would call simple. Tamotsu and his sister Niwaka go to Akihabara, which just like in our world is a place full of otaku merchandise, anime, manga, maid cafes and such. In one of the shops with exclusive goods he meets Arisa, a busty girl from Finland and they quickly bond over figurines. Later he also runs into Mayonaka who is a part of defense group that protects the place from incidents, but it turns out there's more to it. Monsters invade Akiba and as Tamotsu rushes to save his sister he gets tangled up in the war between the two groups. He receives special powers that end up trapping him. Without much choice he becomes the protector Akiba deserved and desperately needed.\\n\r\nSome of you may see this as a generic plot, but you forgot one part of it all- the title. Sure, you could just read it as a trip to Akiba, but if you could just take that s and put it next to the second word, you'll understand that this anime is going to offer more than just the plot. It's gonna offer all the \"plots\", if you know what I'm saying *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge*\\n\r\nEkhm... sorry about that.\\n\r\nThe way that the Bugged Ones - the previously mentioned monsters that disguise themselves as humans - are defeated, is by stripping them down completely. You can expect a lot of character fanservice in here, all damage is done through ripping off clothes so that's kinda obvious, but I feel like it's a very important part of all the craziness that it tries to portray.\\n\r\nSpeaking of the craziness, the most important part of it is the format of the show. It's like an episodic \"adventure\" type of a show with the last couple of episodes trying to create an ending for a season. It's something that I immediately connect with the cartoons that I watched when I was younger, kinda like Teen Titans or Ben 10. Putting this into an anime isn't anything new, far from it. It's been used a lot, but not in the way that those previously mentioned shows do. Akiba's Trip embraces itself entirely. It knows it's a trashy show and it should only concentrate on fun, possibly leaving some space for an arc at the end of it. I wouldn't say it's a justification of how the show lacks serious progression through over half of its runtime or how every story has to end in one episodes, it's just my way of experiencing the show and seeing it for what it is rather than as something it clearly never aimed for. This show doesn't try to be serious, even if may seem like it does, it always plays it for the laughs in the end. It's self-aware, knows who it panders to, often touches on the topic of who are otakus and knows its limits. I really appreciate how this series handles the topics of unity and the otaku culture. It's actually beautiful. Still, this leaves the viewer with the question: Is that enough?\\n\r\nNow the answer will depend on the content of the episodes, so let's talk about that. As I mentioned, Akiba's Trip indulges itself in its trashiness. It makes the best decision it possibly could have made: it creates episodes for all the nerds out there.\\n\r\nYou watch wrestling? There's an episode about wrestling.\\n\r\nYou watch gaming tournaments? There's an episode about a gaming tournament.\\n\r\nYou watch porn? There's an episode about porn.\\n\r\nYes, I'm serious.\\n\r\nWhile the first episode is only a poor exposition, because it gives the impression of it being just an ecchi show, everything past that is pure madness. It doesn't have only one thing it uses, it has multiple ones that it completely overblows. And that's fun! Yes, it's the same formula over and over, the team meets someone who later turns out to be a Bugged One that they defeat by stripping him/her, but it manages to keep it fresh. You may think that its episodic nature will ruin the feeling of continuity or that the lack of connection could just turn it into a boring show that only has cool moments. Worry not, the cast is here to help.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just as ridiculous and fickle as the plot. Tamotsu jumps from being a hipster to being a normie to being a mainstream fag at any convenient point. It's not because he is written poorly, but because he lives in freaking Akiba. You can find everything there, and so he tries all of it out one by one. You can say that he has an attention span of a dog. He's honestly a great main character for the series, easily relatable and constantly changing to be compatible with the current topic. Haven't you ever went through a phase in your life? That chunk of your precious time that you spent on only one type of entertainment over a certain period of your existence, like wrestling, gaming and such. Tamotsu is the embodiment of that, it's just because of the situation he found himself in, he changes his interests more often.\\n\r\nThe only character that could come close to  Tamotsu in terms of sudden changing is Arisa Ahokainen. She traveled all over the world and experienced many different things, but decided to roll with the squad in Akiba. This busty blonde from Finland is more of a companion than anything else, but she does have several unique features. She cosplays at all times, changing her clothes multiple times throughout an episode, her voice is very high pitched and her energy is endless.\\n\r\nThe other two group members are Mayonaka, who's just a tomboy with a baseball bat, and Niwaka, who ends up being a damsel in distress a bit too much. There's seriously not much to say about them, though their characters do progress and become more likable as time goes on.\\n\r\nThe main cast works really well off of each other, for example Tamotsu's and Arisa's clumsiness contrasts with Mayo's sense of duty. It's used in a pretty simple way: When a specific reaction seems to be the best one, the characters that can pull that expression off step up to the spotlight. It works rather well and gives off a feeling of good character rotation and solid comedic timing.\\n\r\nThe minor characters and the episodic ones are a bit stretched out, but they are mostly pushed to the sidelines to let the main cast take the center stage. They're rather forgettable, but I think that's mostly because of the fact that they're quickly replaced and the show doesn't stop to let you drill them into your memory. Overall though, the cast does a solid job at making me want to see their misadventures continue.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the more technical aspects, this show is fair. Some of you who only saw the first three episodes may look at this and think \"This guy's an idiot\" and well.... you may be somewhat right. Akiba's Trip looks flat out ugly at some moments. Some movement, especially during a couple of action scenes, feel like characters are actually blobs, certain camera angles make them look like abominations and overall the art style looks silly. Everything I just mentioned I was able to spot within the first two episodes, however, this series did grow on me. The color pallet is probably as good as it could be, even if blue dominates it, there are so many contrasting elements that each scene is pleasing to the eye. The animation gets more exciting and sudden, which is a good thing. Action scenes include several strong sakuga moments, even if a bit short. All that really fits with the chaotic and explosive feeling the plot and characters give off. That's not to say it isn't flawed past the first episodes. The character designs are a bit too normal at times or way too out there at others (the main cast is designed very well though) and the CGI crowds tend to break the immersion. The music also works in the series' favor, actually, it's probably one of the best parts of the anime. It's consistently good and fitting and has several good themes that I would gladly listen to on their own. I would assume it comes from the games, which could explain why the quality of the tracks is so good.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is rather simple, you probably heard similar ones, but it's catchy, fiery, the music fits the visuals exceptionally well and it made me ready for each episode with the right deal of excitement. It's solid. The idea for the ED's is really damn good though. Once again, the action takes place in Akiba, so what better way to end an episode than to showcase some up and coming singers or groups? Each episode has a different song, performed by a different J-Pop artist or an idol group. I can't say more than one or two stuck in my mind for longer than a second, but nonetheless this idea fits the theme of the series perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nMy relationship with Akiba's Trip is that of a love-hate one. I can easily say that it was enjoyable as much as it could be. It was able to sell me on its story and characters despite me having extremely negative things to say about it after the first episodes. I am pretty sure this will end up being a disappointed to a lot of viewers. It's visual style is a big turn-off straight off the bat and the rest of it doesn't seem promising enough to continue. However, this series does evolve and starts taking clearer direction the more time it gets, especially as a weekly, bombastic series that one could watch after a long day of work or studying, at least it was so for me. It's definitely not one that works well for binging, but as an episodic one that you can watch every once in a while it may prove to be a surprise hit. With that in mind, I fully recommend Akiba's Trip The Animation. It's a fun bunch of episodes that may even be considered as longer skits. Comedy can't appeal to everyone, but when it's an overblown parody catered to otakus, I'm sure some will find it enjoyable. Expect a lot of fanservice too. That's how this show rolls, and if you can't accept that at the start, you won't get anything out of it.

Thank you for your time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion. I recommend you to develop you own.",

            "content": "I gave this anime a chance for several reasons.\r\nOne is that the art style stood out to me.  I liked the colors even just on the picture representing the anime.  Actually I think the art is the best thing about this anime.\r\nThe second is that the premise seemed light and funny despite its ecchi-ness.  I don't respect fanservice... and naturally the less of it an anime has, the more I respect that anime.  Despite that, it doesn't turn me off to a show.  I tolerate it and even sometimes enjoy it... like we all do.  (There's two kinds ofpeople who watch anime: people who occasionally enjoy fanservice and liars).  [That's a half joke.  Don't get all triggered on me].\\n\\n\r\nANYWAYS\\n\\n\r\nThis anime did something to me that I hate: A tonal shift immediately after the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nI went into this anime with pretty much 0 expectations, thinking it to be a simple, silly, goofy anime that I could stop watching when I picked my next 'good' anime to watch.  The first episode however, despite the comedy, was fairly dark.  Combat was well animated (I think.  Sometimes less is more if you ask me.)  And there was more blood than I expected.  Also more intimacy than I expected with, actually, a fairly decent meeting of lips as far as anime goes.  Even the fanservice had some plot significance.  It all came together and made me interested to see where the story went.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then they did nothing with it.  The story has not progressed in 8 episodes, and after teasing me with the tone of the first episode, it immediately became the silly goofy worthless kind of anime that I had expected it to be, each episode becoming harder to get through.  And yes, I binged the 8 episodes (out at the time of this review) in 2 nights, hoping that the tone of the first episode was foreshadowing a darker second half.  Now, seeing as I can't seem to find an intended episode count anywhere I suppose it could be longer... but my guess is that they're going for a 10-12 episode anime, which we are quite passed the halfway point of.  That makes me sad.\\n\\n\r\nI did know, however, that my hope for a dark twist was probably in vain.  As much as the first episode had good interesting 'darker' moments, there was a lot of silliness there too.  I probably would have enjoyed the what I've seen a little better if I hadn't raised my expectations.  Emphasis on 'probably.'\\n\\n\r\nBottom line is, this anime isn't that good, and it's not meant to be, and they knew it wasn't meant to be when they made it, and a part of me respects that, but not enough to give it a good rating.",

            "content": "Another game turned anime adaptation, this better not have the video game adaptation curse because LA already had enough of shitty video game anime adaptations from 2016!!!...\r\n\r\nIt's different in it's own quirky way...\r\nFor it's introductory episode, Akiba's Trip does bring us the setting as well as how Electric Mayonnaise gets formed as well as the threat of the Bugged Ones and how to defeat them. After that?, it has an episodic format where a new Bugged One threat appears, Electric Mayonnaise stumbles or is directly influenced by the new fad of Akihabara or Tamotsu Denkigai voiced by Haruki Ishiya's latest craze todefeat the Bugged Ones. Akiba's Trip using it's episodic format looks into the otaku subcultures through this setting, from fighting games, computer parts, card games, anime figures, idols, audiophiles and even pro-wrestling!. How Akiba's Trip look at these topics are wide ranging from knowing A LOT about it or just wanting to parody it using it's otaku subcultures as a foundation.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is a flaw to all this is that because of it's episodic format, the main cast consisting of Tamotsu, Niwaka Denkigai voiced by Marika Kouno, Tamotsu's little sister, Arisa Ahokainen voiced by Yuki Nagaku a die-hard cosplayer and local tank of Electric Mayonnaise and Matome Mayonaka voiced by Rie Takahashi, the one who introduced Tamotsu and the rest of the cast to the threat of the Bugged Ones and love interest of Tamotsu though she's incredibly tsundere shy about it. The flaw is that there isn't much character development to the main cast as it's more about the episode looking at Tamotsu's latest craze or otaku subculture fad than it's character and that's where Akiba's Trip lacked heavily (Niwaka being the best example of this as she's more of a satellite character than anything until she gets focus later on). The defense to all this is that Electric Mayonnaise as a group does develop as a team in fighting the Bugged One of the week only solidifying their teamwork and we learn a bit more about Arisa to Tamotsu and Niwaka's sibling relationship (no it's not incest trust LA) to about Matome by the final arc but her a bit later. Even the Bugged Ones themselves are stereotypically hammy evil though there are some red herrings making the REAL Bugged Ones even more lacking and one-hit strip kills at times just to close the episode off. Akiba's Trip seems more to be focusing on it's otaku culture in it's forefront with it's characters on the background until they need development and LA doesn't fault the anime that much for that as the main cast DOES get developed somewhat cleverly over the course of the anime. LA's favourite character was at first Matome then quickly became a tie between Matome and Arisa, but ultimately it went back to Matome.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one saving grace to Akiba's Trip to it however, is that the animation is BOMBASTIC even outside it's \"battles\"...allowing Gonzo to go all over the place, from purposefully low quality to the reference-crazy detail as hell moments to battles it gets into. LA just loves when Akiba's Trip and by extension Gonzo going reference and meta-crazy and knowing how self-aware it is which can be another saving grace to Akiba's Trip.\\n\\n\r\nHmmmm...that voice cast seems familiar...ohh right, Marika Kouno, Yuki Nagaku and Rie Takahashi were all from Sore ga Seiyuu!...nice Gonzo bringing up another of your titles, the three even sing the OP and some of the ED's! *ahem* with it's voice cast, LA would say that Yuki Nagaku has very unique vocals and was a hoot to hear with her semi-Japanese cadence, Marika Kouno as Niwaka feels like she is projecting Rin Kohana from Sore ga Seiyuu and Rie Takahashi is voicing her typical vocals. Haruki Ishiya sounds very much like he was having a blast voicing Tamotsu and the impressive minor cast voice cast was GREAT to have as well. \\n\\n\r\nFor an anime named Akiba' STrip, the fanservice if anything is surprisingly light, sure there are the expected bra's and panties and occasional panty shots and the one-strip kill shots, but the anime doesn't focus on that all due to the meta-self aware nature of Akiba's Trip directing, the fanservice feels more like an afterthought that trying to deliberately leer at it's fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nThe \"final arc\" of Akiba's Trip if anything does make the anime bit better for those people who wants anime with a bit more of an impactful and cohesive plot and this really puts the Electric Mayonnaise gang to it's max tension though the \"drama\" is given more as a detour than any actual drama and give much needed factor towards Matome as a character and her connection to the main villain of the series. A flaw to this is it's episodic otaku subculture element disappears however it should be noted that the \"bigger picture\" a la major villain of the anime plotline was touched upon A LOT during the episodic format but nonetheless, even with all these elements of the build up to character development to it's otaku subculture elements disappearing, the ending still brought back it's wacky own flavour it had during the episodic format with little details amongst the final arc of the anime and by that LA means that the final episode is essentially a literal FINAL DUNGEON with the BIG BOSS at the end! and it went in a blaze of glory on how the ending was executed and although it had allegories of otaku's nature and how parents look at them and it still kept it's bombastic atmosphere by the end of it and LA will praise this kind of ending and how it was handled.\\n\\n\r\nAkiba's Trip: The Animation being a very self-aware \"Bugged Ones\" of the week looking at the subculture of otaku's makes this video game anime adaptation rather a different breed of adaptation to say the least. It has it's flaws sure, but it's bombastic and self-aware nature and the comedy coming from that makes this anime adaptation either a guilty pleasure for LA or a very good self-aware parody anime about otaku subculture...nonetheless Akiba's Trip: The Animation for LA is an honest to god guilty pleasure for Winter 2017 for LA...flaws and all!",

            "content": "This will be my first review, I believe. Normally I wouldn't bother for a series like this, however I felt it was important to try and point out some of the major issues that many people simply haven't addressed in reviews thus far.\r\nFirst of all, I have seen two major 'sides' when it comes to debate on this series. There is the side that argues that it fails on account of being an Akiba's Trip anime without referring back to the games from which it gets its lineage. Secondly, there's the camp that argues that the anime fails as a series in a traditional sense,through fault of its characters, overall story and other such things. I'm of the belief that both camps are completely incorrect.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, Akiba's Trip is not a traditional anime, nor is it relying on the success of the game franchise it hails from. In fact, I believe that it succeeds for the same reason that the game it hails from succeeded in the first place. This anime is a celebration of otaku culture and Akiba itself. As a result, it casts aside expected conventions of a solid story structure, engaging characters and even its own plot to simply deliver on its purpose of celebrating the electric town of Akihabara.\\n\\n\r\nHow have I gathered this? Well, firstly I'd point to the story structure. While the first episodes do indeed set up a narrative, a villain and a purported structure, the rest of the series proves that it has no intention on following through with this as would be expected. Instead, each episode is almost entirely self-contained, focusing on a specific aspect of otaku culture and Akihabara life in general. One episode it may be idols, another it's military otaku, yet another it's radio otaku. The focus is not on the characters or the story in these moments. It's to serve as a grand celebration of the reality it's taking inspiration from.\\n\\n\r\nI have been to Akihabara several times and I should emphasize that the enjoyment of this series is magnified many times when you have first-hand experience. Many, if not all of the buildings seen are real buildings. The occurrences within the 'plot' are exaggerations of daily life within those buildings and on those streets. In this regard, I'd almost say that this series wasn't even made for a wider audience. Many of the references and much of the humor seems to be directed specifically at people who frequent Akiba or are at least major otaku themselves. \\n\\n\r\nThe humor is irreverent. Of course it is, why wouldn't it be? The story is already extremely silly on its most basic foundation, so it only seems natural that the actual gags would be even sillier. The humor is built very solidly on in-jokes that only those within the wider otaku community would be able to appreciate. This furthers my assertion that this series was never intended for a wide audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is admittedly rather sub-par. Sometimes improved on by impressive character design and facial expressions, however the solid colour schemes, lack of movement and backgrounds that at times are indisputably just augmented photographs are hard to simply let-slide each and every time. I do however feel that certain elements of this are worth dismissing. As I have stated before, I feel this anime was never created with the intention of reaching a wide audience. I suspect that the budget was very low from the outset and that talented staff members from the studio were likely relegated to different shows. As it stands however, the art and animation is certainly nothing special and at times can be a let-down.\\n\\n\r\nAn aspect in stark contrast is the sound design. The voice actors perform a serviceable job, with some notable exceptions being quite striking and impressive to boot. However the key is the music. Both background music which is at times directly lifted from the games to provide a cheerful and effective mood, as well as the variety of songs used at the end of each episode which I would suspect are likely a method of improving a lackluster budget. In any case, all failures are forgiven in the face of the monotone idol from the idol episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a mixed bag indeed. The protagonist himself is frankly a delight as a result of how blatant he is in his lack of interest for just about every event of the story. Many episodes occur largely as a result of him indulging in his otaku desires and having them taken to a cartoonish extent. In the context of this show, I find it appropriate. It touches on the mindset of particular otaku communities rather well and at times, it feels as though he himself is a representation of Akihabara. The supporting cast are far more mixed, with segway-loli being hilarious in her very few scenes and miss Moi Moi being a constant barrel of fun with constant costume changes and contrived backstories. The only elements where this feels somewhat hurt is in the other two female leads, who often seem to take too much of a back-seat and lack personality themselves.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found this an extremely enjoyable series, especially in the context of what I believe it was trying to achieve. It's not a perfect series. Certainly not. If rated against other shows to try and live up to their standards, it would fall flat on many fronts. However if other shows attempted to live up to its specific standards, I can see it quite easily blowing many of them out of the water.\\n\\n\r\nNot the best series of this season by a long-shot. However in terms of raw enjoyment and appreciation for what it attempted to set out to achieve, I feel it would be doing the series a disservice to rate it below an 8. In its own particular playing field, I feel it knocked it out of the park. Here's hoping the last few episodes don't make me eat my words.",

It's good to be bad, but he does not take himself seriously from the start and it's clear.\r\nThe anime for many times has no meaning at all, animation is very inconsistent to bad, but it's very funny, fun, full of references to other anime and games (some really cheeky) and has some (few) great battles.\r\nThe characters have no depth, but this was purposeful, Akiba is very well represented here, which is one of the highlights of the anime and the soundtrack is good.\r\nI found it ok, the anime fulfilled its role of being unpretentious.\r\nPs: Sorry formy english.

            "content": "First, do not look at my rating/s. It is strictly based on enjoyment. I refuse to be a person who looks for flaws and assumptions only to ruin his enjoyment and memories of shows. And not to mention ruin the chances for others to pick a show just because someone trusted a stranger instead of them self.\r\nThis review's purpose is to write how I experienced the show, what I remember specifically and what I liked and to spread positivity.\r\nIf your overall experience is great, then changing something will only change the overall feeling. Which is not necessarily guaranteed to be a good thing as somepeople might think. Something is what it is and that's why your overall experience was great. You are lying to yourself if you think you really want something changed.\\n\\n\r\n- What especially stuck with me during this show is the art, sound and how every factor that makes a show in general was executed during fight scenes. Just like with any show I don't think you get much grasp of the director's and the cinematographers (if they have the 2nd in anime development, in any case I mean a person with similar jobs during development) work during common scenes. Since this is a comedy and action you can expect it during action scenes and eventually scenes with an outburst of comedy, such an outburst that rivals movement/action scenes. Meaning that there is enough going on that it can feel like an action (as happenings) scene even without the real action (as action). During those instances you tend to notice directing. It all depends on the individual of course. You all perceive something differently and with more intensity. Worth to note: still scenes (moments) and common scenes aren't the same.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the fight scenes everything moves so smoothly and makes you follow. Whether or not they had innovative animation techniques (I refuse to look back in depth just to nitpick on myself) the fight scenes will most definitely give you the feeling that there's a lot of creative work done on them. And with the art style we have, the animation during fight scenes is matching. Or rather the art style makes the animation look even better.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have to mention the sound. The opening is one of the best I've heard and has a lot of replay value and gives you energy. The ost during the show also did not disappoint. \\n\\n\r\nThe show handles it's surroundings or backgrounds greatly, as the composition of the scene, the characters involved and the feeling of how said scene continually keeps to get your attention so deep on what actually is the point of the scene, it all is mixed in perfectly to keep your focus on what is intended.\\n\\n\r\nThe usage of colors in the show create the overall and happy feeling. An excellent match for the comedy parts of our characters. The character's designs are memorable and the color difference even helps them with that. For sure is a certain character the comic relief, char name spoiler inbound, warning you again, I mean our ari even though the show is cheerful anyway. However all the characters are likeable just like that. And the voices are made for them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show gave me everything I love about, well, shows with a happy and sunny vibe. And with my next sentence I also have to mention that it does capture the feeling of a game. (It's not necessarily an adaption, as It seems the characters are different.) What I mean is it's noticeable that it works as a game and an anime (and other stuff) so that's a thumb up.\\n\\n\r\nI need to get a physical copy of the game sometime.",

            "content": "Hey there, this is my first review and I would like to do it to express myself and let people know if this is the kind of anime that you would like to watch.\r\nFirst, Akiba's Trip The Animation is not related to the game's story, this means that you will not see the main characters of the game and their development along with the story of it but a whole new cast and a new story instead.\r\nThe reason why this anime caught my attention was because of the name of the game, but I was slighty disappointed when I saw that it wasn't related toit, although I changed my mind after the first episodes and a very specific one (avoiding to spoil) that made me hook up with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo lets begin.\\n\\n\r\nStory: As mentioned before, don't expect the game's development here but hey, don't let appearances fool you, this doesn't mean that it will automatically become bad or mediocre, the approach of this one is actually more of a parodic style and.. I like it, I'm having fun with it laughing a lot with certain episodes and enjoying the rest of them.\\n\r\nEach episode is pretty much independent, they have their own setup that doesn't follow a straight line with the plot, kinda like a cartoon so if you're a viewer that doesn't like these stuff and want instead something else with a story development I don't suggest this to you, but if you don't mind that or you're interested in it, you'll have some fun times out there!\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't solid, but the anime can talk by itself with its episodes.\\n\r\n6.4/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: I like the art, but I think it's just something fine. There are some aspects of it that I like that are unique used in a comedic way and the character design is good-looking.\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing much to say here. I like the opening and the seiyuus are good, the sound effects aren't surprising but they're fine, no complaints here.\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I personally find the characters here pretty appealing and have their own personalities well-built. You won't find them flat, generic or lacking something.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is the strongest point of the anime in my opinion, because \\n\r\nwhat it really matters is how you interpret something, even if it's not the greatest thing in the world, you can make it better in your own way. You can enjoy this anime even if it doesn't have the best story or anything similar as long as it is done well.\\n\\n\r\nI have been enjoying this anime with each episode.\\n\r\n7.1/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's a good anime, not the best one out there but I feel that it's pretty unique and it defends well by itself, you'll have fun with the characters and the things they do during the episodes, each episode having a different mini-plot, and plenty of other things.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here is the last score\\n\r\n7/10",

Matome well she one of the female leads and the original defender of akiba she is a tough chick with Tamotsu and also defending akiba she does get angry a good few times at Tamotsu but that's it otherwise she a pretty tough but also nice girl. Arisa is another female lead she is a pretty good fighter aswell not a bugged on but she can kick some butt she is also kinda like Tamotsu that he is a Otaku at heart (well maybe not at heart as him but close) otherwise a pretty good and decent character overall. Niwaka is the sister to Tamotsu and the last female lead in the anime honestly she cant really fight or do anything really so there just to help them with other stuff also she does like her brother (not like incest love btw) otherwise a decent character and a nice and kind one at that. Tasujin is a supporting character and is a scientist to the there group Electric mayonnaise she would basically provide stuff on to help them battle the bugged ones a decent character overall.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Things that i liked: the comedy was here and there it took awhile for the comedy to really get me but later on it was good and the action was damn good for the most part and the characters were all really well done for the most part. Things that i didn't like: again the comedy to was here and there it really to me AWHILE for it to actually get me to laugh out loud if anything most of the anime was like me smiling also that one of the characters Arisa i felt was kinda here just for the fan service (also sorry for spoiler shes never a bugged one) so yeah and also every time she would say moi or whatever it was she said was kinda annoying i could see people not liking her.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: it was hard for me to give this a 7 or a 8 or even a 7.5 but in the end i just went with a 8 i think for me the comedy got better for sure as the anime went along and that the action was damn well done and also i loved most of the characters that made this anime really well done i would recommend this anime",

I also like how the plot has superhuman powers but I feel like the technology used is a bit too unrealistic for the setting. The art is stunningly amazing and the video/animation quality is great, as well as having eye popping colours (and characters, which I'll explain later).\r\nI really like how the show starts and has fast paced and peppy songs. I'm kind of into that, but it would be a little better if they had subtitles for the songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are pretty cool, with interesting personalities and colourful hair, as well as a couple of cool and...busty people *Cough, Arisa cough*. The fight scenes are awesome and some are just downright spectacular, with some casual moments to break the ice. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a pretty great anime. Too bad it only has 1 season.

            "content": "So I was originally gonna pass up this anime, I figured it was just another cookie cutter anime and really didn't think I would enjoy it. Optimistically I thought I might get a small amount of enjoyment out of it, but I never expected that I would have an absolute blast!\r\nAkiba's Trip is an anime that knows exactly what it is, what it wants to be, and is completely unapologetic about all of it. It knows that its a fan service-y anime and that means it will lose a lot on depth, but because of that it never allows itself to take itself too seriously.\r\nDespitethis the anime manages to pull off some damn fine comedy, constructs stories that are interesting for a 'villain-of-the-week scenario', and really absorb you into the world of Akiba. Combined with a good cast of characters whom all compliment one another in some way it's a wild ride right from episode 1. \\n\\n\r\nFair warning, there may be some spoilers in these later sections, the point of the above summary is to go over the general idea of what I'll cover in detail later.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThe story is NOTHING to be impressed about, it has a very basic premise. Simply put it's 'oh look bad guys doing bad guy things watch the good guys do good guy things' with the added 'if you get stripped you lose' bit at the end. It is every bit as ridiculous as that sounds, but that's ok. Like I said this anime never takes itself too seriously, it knows what it is and what it wants to be and isn't interested in playing up ANY level of melodrama. It's only goal is to get a few laughs and it accomplishes that which is why I rate it so highly because the story effectively exists in service OF that comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nAgain, the art itself isn't super impressive and the animation is just the 'yup that's anime' level of animation. What REALLY sells this art is the characters. You can tell based off every character you meet that the creative team really ran with the idea that hair color is indicative of whether someone is a Bugged One as a lot of these hairstyles are pretty imaginative. Especially in the main cast whom all seem to function well as a whole, artistically speaking. Unfortunately, animation is a real big deal to me so I can't really rate it too highly. However, the fact that the characters be they side or main were all fun to just look at speaks volumes to the care that went into crafting them. In my opinion at least.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe sound direction was pretty on point in regards to SFX. I like my SFX to be realistic and the show stays true to that for the most part, and I especially liked the sound effect for when a Bugged One was disrobed really sold that feeling of 'whoohoo they did it!' The music choice, much like everything else, was ok. Nothing really wrong with it, nothing really great about it. What's more important than that was the timing, good sound direction can turn almost anything into something great and this show provides a really standard example of that. A general rule is that the music should never lie to the audience, if its a good moment then the music should reflect that. If the situation is dire again, the music should reflect that. The music choice coupled with the timing of delivery really sold those situations perfectly and it works well with this anime. Again, it's still nothing spectacular. But I rate it highly because the sound direction made me notice things that this wasn't just another lazy anime, someone really put effort in and I can appreciate that.\\n\\n\r\nComedy: 9\\n\r\nThis is a special category that I'm adding in here because it deserves this recognition. It's really interesting how comedy ISN'T one of the genres used to describe this anime because in my opinion the comedy is the shining star of this anime. The action scenes are ok, nothing fantastic. While the setting creates a 'supernatural' feel sure, it doesn't steal the show. And yea, the fan service is fairly abundant (which while being abundant I must say it was at least tasteful and not just blatantly shoe-horned in) but fan service has never made an anime great it just gives it sex appeal so it can sell well. No, the COMEDY is where this anime stands in the limelight. There is a rule of thumb about comedy that I adore when speaking in regards to skit comedy, 'When you put a crazy individual in a world of normal people, or put a normal person in a world of crazy people, that's where the comedy happens.' and this anime EXEMPLIFIES this. It took me a couple episodes to realize, but in this anime YOU are that normal person. YOU are the one in the crazy world because everyone in this show is NUCKING FUTS! I would go so far as to say that the comedy in this anime could even stand up to the likes of konosuba, which was also brilliant with it's comedy. It's the fact that this anime blatantly and unabashedly goes for the most outlandish, far left field idea they can go for and  they make that WORK. By episode 3, I found myself on the edge of my seat just excited to find out what wacky and zany adventures these idiots were gonna find themselves in next. No, the comedy is the true star of this show even if it wasn't meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nSo there you have it. This show manages to combine mediocrity with greatness in various areas, especially with its comedy. The end result is a world you can get absorbed in, characters you can care about, and good times that will always manage a laugh out of you. An exciting adventure, and a conclusive and satisfying ending with a neat little cliffhanger for a potential second season (Fingers VERY much crossed). So in short, top recommend.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\nWatch it, it's worth it.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nTo me this was definitely a hidden and underrated gem of the 2017 winter season because this was one fun and hilarious ride.\r\nThe story focuses on Tamotsu and his sister Niwaka who go to Akiba to enjoy all it's Otaku brilliance, but they get attacked by creatures called Bugged ones, they run into Matome who is defending Akiba from this threat and also with the help of Arisa they create a team to defend this Otaku paradise from this new monstrous threat.\r\nYou gotta love a story when it doesn't take itself seriously which is what this show does even though it's about agroup of teens defending a section of town from weird monsters I was surprised to see how well this show worked because I can definitely say it was one funny ride because no matter how dangerous the threat got these group of characters never really got serious about it and seeing shows take the usual cliche that you see in a lot of other anime's and use them as jokes was a delight to see, not only that seeing this group of characters defeat the threat was also really funny like a video game battle, a eating competition and even a card game too. It was also full of references to many other anime's which was great to see the show make fun of because it worked really well with what was happening in many of the situations that happened in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were very likeable and funny Tamotsu is pretty much a big Otaku, but he isn't stupid he actually knows quite a lot of things like at some point his knowledge of electronics actually saved the day plus his none serious and lazy attitude was also really funny and different for once since you don't really see that many male MC's with this personality, but when the time called he can be a kind and protective person depending on what the reason is. Matome is a Tsundere that finally is really likeable true she does hit Tamotsu and makes him do patrols for the Bugged ones, but she actually has a fun personality once you get to know her and even at times she wasn't being serious which shows she can be pretty lose and damn can she eat a lot of food. Arisa is another one of those characters that has the sweet and energetic personality which is always a win for me, but she has a lot of surprises in store like she has a very complex life and is actually very smart plus the funniest aspect of her character is that she always end's up in a different costume well of course she's a cosplayer, but the outfit's she wore sometimes were just hilarious because they seemed so out of place. Niwaka is difficult to decipher mainly because she isn't in some episodes and can't fight against the enemies because she doesn't have powers, but she felt likeable anyway because she didn't do anything to annoy and there were some scenes that she did something that was actually funny.\\n\r\nThe other supporting characters like the Professor who always travelled on her Segway and couldn't even fit in her lab Coat and the many villains were actually pretty good and it was hilarious seeing how over the top the villains were and how easy they were to defeat was also a funny site too.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle felt similar to Kill la Kill not the way the characters were made, but how it was used because a lot of the scenes where someone was being sarcastic or being over the top just reminded me of that show plus for some reason characters like Kage-san just reminded me of lego because their face's were so expressionless just like the lego faces.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was just fantastic there were cliches like the Deus ex Machina cliche that were used as jokes plus there was were a few 4th wall breaks which were pretty funny too, but the characters are what made the show really funny because of their none serious attitude my smile hardly disappeared because it was that funny to watch and the fact that ripping people's clothes off just to defeat also reminded me of High School DxD and to me that's always a good thing. The action though short was pretty fun I liked Tamotsu and Matome's power's and how Tamotsu gained these powers was actually quite surprising although I think I've seen it somewhere before.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a friggin hilarious show if you want something that sorta works like Kill la Kill with it's comedy then you're definitely in for something epically amazing.",

            "content": "TL;DR \u2013 a 5-6 series that might have been 7-8 if it did a few things differently, Akiba's Trip will appeal to fans of ecchi, otaku oriented comedy, but probably not make many favourites lists.\r\nAdapting (I presume somewhat loosely) the video game that seems to sit somewhere between cult & meme, Akiba's Trip is a rough, trashy & unexpectedly enjoyable series that celebrates both the place & the image of Akihabara, perhaps to a fault. It avoids the trap of coming off as insufferably smug about \u201cbeing\u201d otaku in a way that has echoes of some of Gainax's more self-indulgent titles in the 2000s, orrecent series like Twintails, but a limited ambition means it never matches them.\\n\\n\r\nAfter getting killed in the crossfire between the neon red headed Matome Magonaka & the body-snatching Bugged One's, Tamotsu Denkigai finds himself brought back by a kiss, gifted with superhuman powers but trapped forever in Akihabara. What might sound like hell to many is no such burden to him though, there not being a thing about the district he dislikes. There is one other catch, however. If he or any other of those caught up in the battle for Akihabara lose their clothes, they die.\\n\\n\r\nFor the first episode, anyway. Akiba's Trip plays fast & loose with its initial setup, which may annoy some but in truth is for the best, given what the show wants to be: a light-hearted journey down the rabbit hole of the various fandoms & hobbies associated with Akihabara. Most episodes pick a target & proceed to see how deep that hole goes, though not to the point it stops being about the fun, before Bugged Ones show up to try & ruin it.\\n\\n\r\nTo that end, Tamotsu makes for a better protagonist than some more well known \u201cotaku\u201d leads recently. Given that the series is less interested in him & his Electric Mayonaise (his choice) gang & more about using them as a conduit into that episodes subject, he avoids exhibiting the insecure, aggressive \u201cotaku pride\u201d that, for example, makes Saekano's lead so unbearable. The characters in Akiba's Trip have all already joined to dark side, so to speak, so never really feel the need to explain or defend themselves to their peers or the audience, even as they defend Akihabara.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flip side, though, this means that those hoping for a more character focused comedy in the vein of Konosuba will be disappointed. Most of the humour relates to whatever fandom is up that episode, or else more broad ecchi & otaku humour. None of the characters really develop beyond their archetypes: Mayonaka is the tsundere with a crush; Arisa Ahokainen is the bubbly  blonde; Tasujin Ratu is the loli professor & so on. While the main trio do occasionally take turns as leads, they never really change or develop, it even being a recurring joke for Arisa that nothing about her back story really makes sense or connects. \\n\\n\r\nBut as a celebration of Akihabara & its idiosyncrasies, it's pretty fun. If there's a theme that connects the mostly episodic escapades, it's celebrating the diversity that can be found in this den of geekdom. While plenty of jokes are at the fandom's expense, it's never judgemental. Indeed, as guardians of Akihabara, it's that diversity that they're defending, mainly from Bugged One's looking to monopolise the district with some shady scheme. Even the government gets called out, with a jab at \u201cCool Japan\u201d & a corrupt minister trying to shut the \u201cimmoral\u201d district down.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing Akiba's Trip needed, it's a recurring villain. While one emerges for the inevitable dramatic turn in the final three episodes, for the most part it's just Electric Mayonaisse facing off against random Bugged One's, who at times almost feel like an intrusion into the episode. It would have been nice to see a villain working behind the scenes to bring down the Akihabara everyone loves, rather than just assuming one's there because there was a sinister looking woman in episode one & we've seen enough anime to know how that works. They'd have also somewhat offset the lack of development among the main cast by giving an alternative point of view to view the episodes from. At the very least, it would have been nice to have someone end each episode shouting \u201cI'll get you next time, Akihabara!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nFor a production that might be politely considered rough & ready (with emphasis on the rough as the series progresses), you'll be under no misconception about who made it, given that Gonzo seem to slap their name on at least one thing each episode. The production team seem to be going for a look that is comparable either to the \u201cloose\u201d adherence to character models that was positively received in Konosuba, or else perhaps has hints of the kinetic style of Hiroyuki Imaishi. The former is probably more apt, since while Akiba's Trip does have some fun & energetic action sequences, it never matches the feel of Imaishi's work at Gainax & Trigger. \\n\\n\r\nFittingly, given the setting, Akiba's Trip has a very idol otaku targeted soundtrack. As well as the OP by idol unit Earphones there's a different ED for each episode, with an introduction to each group to make sure you know who's singing. How high profile the acts are, I couldn't say, though the Milky Holmes singers feature. The OST is, unfortunately, mostly forgettable, if unobtrusive. There is definitely one track that sounds like Girls Just Wanna Have Fun by Cyndi Lauper, though.\\n\\n\r\nStill, while it could have been more, Akiba's Trip is still a fun time. The characters, though shallow, are a laugh, Akihabara is an entertaining setting & all in all it's a generally enjoyable series. But there's a large crowd of similar anime out there, & Akiba's Trip does enough to get in, but not stand out.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019m amazed that there is an anime out there in which characters eat D\u00f6ner.\r\nStory:\r\nEvil monsters attack Akihabara by taking over the nerd culture and can only be stopped by stripping them naked. What can I possibly say to justify this? It\u2019s exactly as stupid as it sounds. Now, obviously you can see this as a bad thing (and most of you possibly will). The question is, does Akiba Strip use this to its advantage or does it rely on its \u201chilariousness\u201d? Well, sadly it is the latter, most of the time. Akiba Strip is self-aware and that may be its biggest weakness. If I compareit to Kill La Kill for example, which had a similarly ridiculous premise, that show played it straight, which made it work so much better. Akiba is not doing much to flesh itself out and therefore often falls flat. Due to its episodic nature, focusing on one nerdy fandom after another, it also has the problem, that if you are not into the subject matter of the episode, it will be a very boring one. The things it did tackle that I personally had interest in (or at least some basic knowledge of) did just fine as standalone episodes. But subjects I didn\u2019t know or care about left me bored at least 1/3 throughout its run, since the overall \u201cplot\u201d didn\u2019t help me making it through at all.\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAkiba Strip looks very cheap for the most part. Well, actually it looks cheap all the time. Character design and animation is all okay, even though it\u2019s far from being special, but backgrounds and especially background characters did not get much attention. I am also pretty sure they reused quite a few shots, like when the girls had one of their gigs. The special effects looked fine, but they are nothing to write home about really.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI was excited to hear all three members of Earphones together once again, as I have enjoyed watching Sore ga Seiyuu. And sure enough, they all do a really good job. The whole cast seems to have enjoyed voicing their characters, which is great. The music\u2026well, I am not a big fan of J-Pop. At all. But I would be lying if I said that the song the three girls are performing wasn\u2019t catchy as hell. The opening not so much, but it\u2019s definitely okay. Each episode got a unique ending song, so if you\u2019re a fan of that kind of music, you\u2019re in for a treat.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nTo be honest, the main cast is very shallow. The hero is an outgoing hothead, who just happens to be a complete nerd for all kinds of things. Not a very relatable character though, as he often acts like a dick towards the others. In a comedy this can be seen as funny, but it heavily depends on the viewer. I would be a hypocrite to call him out for it, since I enjoyed KonoSuba mostly for the characters being assholes. The leading lady is a stock tsundere and not much else. The same goes for Tamotsus little sister, whose main characteristic is being the main characters little sister. Arisa is the only one of the girls to have somewhat of a personality, being the funny foreigner with a surprising amount of talents in many, many fields. Bonus points for making her Finish instead of being from one of the done to death countries like the USA or the UK. We also have a couple of exposition characters, who felt very unnecessary besides that, I think it could\u2019ve been done just as well without them. Some of the enemy of the week characters were funny, like the Yu-Gi-Oh guy or the pro gamer girl, but many of them didn\u2019t click with me. Finally, the main villain was a total Ragyou rip-off (wether this is a good or a bad thing, I leave it up to you).\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, your enjoyment level is proportionate to your amount of knowledge on the subject matter of the episode. I had a lot of fun with the ones I knew about, like the TCG episode or the wrestling one. Others left me bored, like the gun episode. Akiba Strip (let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s the real name of the show) didn\u2019t do a good job to season the subjects to viewers who aren\u2019t into them and the overarching plot didn\u2019t really help either. Thankfully the grand finale was just as ridiculous as the whole show, I wouldn\u2019t have bought a serious ending. In total, this anime isn\u2019t very good, but it is watchable and sometimes quite funny. I\u2019d say, pick out the episodes that deal with stuff you like and enjoy them, disregard the rest.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n5.0/10",

            "content": "After The Disasterous Life Of Saiki K finished I was in desperate need of a good, satirical anime. \r\nMost comedies are too harum/slice of life for me, as I'm not 13 and sexually frustrated,  so typically I look for comedies that poke fun at the otaku culture and anime culture in dumb, yet interesting ways. \r\nAkibas Trip does just that, and oddly enough- unlike most anime- it actually gets funnier and more original as the season progresses. I'm actually a little sad that it's officially over. \r\nEach episode had a new villain in a long line of villains, and each sort of represented onehobby and/or obsession prevelant in otaku culture, and thus, in Akiba itself. \\n\\n\r\nSuch examples ranged from competitive video gaming, to the exploitation of Idol Singers, to Ham radios and manual cameras, to military fanatics. \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, as the group in the show increased in membership, their bonds deepened, and for such a short comedic show, that's actually quite the accomplishment. \\n\\n\r\nSo, while the show is no where near as intelligent in its satire as say, Saiki K, it's still really funny and totally a great way to enjoy yourself on a boring night.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked \"Haven't you heard? I'm Sakamoto\", \"Mob Psycho 100\" or \" Saiki K\" you'll probably enjoy this too. I'm liking this new wave of actually funny anime that pokes fun at our ridiculous culture that we hold so dear. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, even though each episode stands alone great, there is actual continuity and a vague storyline thats \"there\" just enough to make you want to see the next episode and see where our oddball crew will end up next. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, thankfully this is based off the game of the same name, so you can always play that if you truly want more of what the anime had to offer.",

Two episodes that will have you in tears laughing, would be the Yu-Gi-Oh episode and the WWE parody episode. You cannot watch those two with a straight face.

Lightweight, no deep thinking required, with an \"awwwh\" moment every now and then.\r\n________________\r\nAs other reviews already stated, Akibas Trip is basically a hit & miss for every single episode (apart from the first and the last 2-3 ones I guess).\r\nOverall -\r\nIf you are into otaku / nerd stuff, give it a try.. you might like it. If you are only in for the romance, you can watch the first 1-2 episodes and then skip to episode 10.\r\nI was a bit unsure becauseof the rather low 6.70 rating, but I actually quite liked it. There definitely are worse ways to spend your time.\\n\\n\r\nStory & Content -\\n\r\nMost of the episodes don't follow a big story / plot, instead they are small stories, known from e.g. Rick & Morty. The whole show itself is pretty lightweight, and focuses big time on paroding different otaku/nerd stuff each time.. which is the hit & miss part about it, might be you find yourself laughing your ass off at one episode and being bored on the next one.\\n\r\nThere is an action aspect to it, which isn't badly made, although the protagonists never have any real struggles when fighting the opponents, so it's rather some extra sugar on top.\\n\\n\r\nThe final few episodes are the actual plot of the story, nothing spectacular and pretty straight forward, but if you watch this show for a deep story you're in the wrong place anyway. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also romance to it, to the point that I don't get why this show doesn't have a romance tag.. after all, there are many shows out there labelled as romance with way less romantic content in it. There are 4 kiss scenes throughout the show (although 2 of them can hardly count because of the circumstances), a date episode and an ending which leaves no doubt. \\n\\n\r\nArt -\\n\r\nThe art style itself is okay, nothing fancy but not bad either, pretty much the average modern anime art style. The art style sometimes seems lazy (considering scenes with crowds like a concert), but it doesn't bother much either. And for some characters they obviously wanted to make them look ridiculous, as to push the parody even further.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -\\n\r\nJust like for the story, the show doesn't care about having deep characters. They have some backstory you get to see, and their behavior is pretty understandable and consistent, so no issue here. \\n",

            "content": "Akiba's Trip was a really fun show. After reading the synopsis it may sound like it's all about fan service but I think it's more about the humor. Even the fan service is more humorous then provocative. I'd say its main focus is on the otaku culture and using that as a source of humor. It does it in a way that pokes fun while also paying homage to it. If you're new to anime then I don't think I'd recommend this one. Also if you're going to watch it for the fan service then you might be disappointed. There's no real nudity and allof it is more for laughs than anything else. I was good with this because comedy was what I was looking for and that's about all you can expect from this show. As long as people go into it with that mind set I think they'll really enjoy the show.",

            "content": "First Review. Here goes nothing. (Is that supposed to be a milestone?)\r\nAkiba's Trip: The Animation is a giant homage to everything otaku, and yet still manages to be its own thing. That's why I like it.\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nThe story is fairly simple, until you learn why the bugged ones are there in the first place. At first glance, it's nothing really special.  Tamotsu Denkigai, our otaku main character, is nearly killed by a creature called a bugged one, but Mayonaka Matome saves him by turning him into a bugged one. And together they defend the city from other bugged ones. It's not very deep, butit works. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art style definitely fits this anime. It isn't too detailed, but it isn't bad. All the characters look normal. The backgrounds are passable, but nothing spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI would be lying if I said this anime didn't have it's share of damn good tunes. The background music is good, fight music is even better, but the real cream of the crop is the opening. My God, it's amazing, it's fast paced, and it fits the tone of the anime. The ED music changes every episode, and usually it's good music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of character, there's not much to write home about. Tamotsu is your average otaku, but he's a little more invested in technology and collecting than your generic otaku. Mayonaka is a pseudo-tsundere, and the bugged ones are all themed around things related to shopping in the Akihabara area, such as computers and maid cafes.  Overall, it's nothing really original. Personally, this is the low point of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI was able to get some laughs out of this, the jokes can be corny but overall good, and the fight scenes were enjoyable. The show knows when to be series most of the time, and there were some interesting surprises in Akiba's Trip that made me laugh at how dumb they were. (Oh boy, if you don't know what I'm talking about, you will find out.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nIf you're expecting something drastically new, then this probably isn't for you. \\n\r\nAT:TA has a great concept, but it feels like a lot of the elements in this anime I've already seen. In general, I think this is a pretty good anime, good for people who want to be entertained in more than one way, and bad for those who are craving something original.",

We get to see the city through their perspective (along with the culture). There is a lot of references in the anime.\r\nCHARACTERS: #ELECTRICMAYONNAISE \r\nTamotsu: Very ambitious, funny, and can be very persistent. He is also very caring and sometimes can get out of hand whenever he tries to get what he wants.\r\nMatome: Can come off as cold, but is basically the team leader of the group. She is strict and has a modest wardrobe with her outfits.\r\nNikawa: Tamotsu's younger sister, sweet, andcute.\\n\r\nArisa: Tall, blonde, has large assets, and strong martial arts and wrestling background, she is well-rounded and has travelling around the world. She really loves the city.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: This anime is basically advertising its viewers to come check out Akihabara! \u2665 I love the action, fighting scenes it contains. It's really interesting to learn about the strengths and weaknesses between the teams that are fighting the monsters. (To be honest, the method of defeating the monsters is quite funny and may contain some fan service).",

Enjoyment, this is supposed to be a comedy anime, and you know what gags and jokes they are going to make before they even start moving, so... just focus on the art and the seiyuus, which are, by the way, reallynice.\\n\\n\r\nThere's just no originality, nothing fun about it.

            "content": "So before I start my review, I want everyone to understand that there is a game for this particular anime. However, I want you all to also understand that this anime have no relation to the story of the game in any way and that it is not an adaptation. If you're watching this anime expecting it to be an adaptation, you could watch on hoping it will suit your taste or you could move on with your life. You may be wondering why this anime have the same name as the game since it's not an adaptation, the reason is simple. The basis behindboth the game and this anime is that it revolve around these particular species that are similar to vampires. They will die under sunlight if they are exposed enough. To defeat these creatures, you must strip them. That's it. Simple.\\n\\n\r\nNow enough about the game, let me move on to the anime. This anime, essentially have an original story using the basis of the game, the vampire-like species. A note before you advance to this anime, the first 10 episodes, have no plot what so ever, basically like a slice of life anime that shows random things and hobby that the main character have. While the anime may be weird (Yes, it is really weird), it is actually rather enjoyable for me to watch. If you're looking for the ecchi element, the only things you'll see are character being striped naked and half naked characters, there really isn't any thing else. At least not that I remember. \\n\\n\r\nOn to the art style, I'll rate it a 7 in my books. To me at least, it's quite a generic common art style these days, so nothing much to comment here. Though it's also not badly drawn. Basically it's a likable style that are common.\\n\\n\r\nFor sounds, I'll rate it an 8. It have quite a few catchy music and while there's only one opening song, there are quite a few different ending songs. I like the short catchy moment during an action scene and there isn't really any music that I dislike.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, I can't really rate it. The character are really unique when compared to other anime. They each have their distinct personality and would be hard to rate. At the minimum, I can tell you that there are none of them that I hate. All the characters are rather likable.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, despite it being weird overall, it is really enjoyable to me. It's an anime with no real serious plot and that it has many funny and strange moments. As long as you don't have any real expectations for it, you'll definite enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's weird. I'll definitely recommend it if you want something that have many strange/weird moments. Also, keep your expectations low for this anime. The action are simple and quick, no real sense of plot, and basically very random throughout. I'm not sure what the creator meant for this anime to become but to me, it's something you can watch when you have nothing else to do.\\n\\n\r\nThis is also the first time I'm trying to review something. I don't think I'm good at reviewing but I tried my best to make it understandable.",

I considered to get and try it out before watching this anime, but I figured out, based on available anime info, that that would not be necessary. \r\nI've seen a lot of complaints about the tasteless ecchi, but after a few episodes, I failed to notice that, heck, there is barely any ecchi here (there are naked women, stupid outfits, etc. but if you look deeper, you can see my point), and even where there is naked skin on screen, the studio failed to draw it as even remotely appealing...you could say that people that worked on the animation, really have no taste.\\n\\n\r\nThis is more or less comedy oriented anime. There is an overarching action/supernatural plot, but they never really expanded on it too much and it quickly turned to episodic anime that mostly cares about its gags. And given the priority to comedy above everything else, they rarely went beyond the most average jokes you could write. The same applies to the slapstick, it works only now and then. So it at least could squeeze some chuckles out of me. But what totally put me off from watching it more are the characters. I have nothing against two MCs, I like the design and sometimes even the quirky personalities. However, I almost fully despise most of the side characters and villains. There is annoying foreign sidekick who only serves for same stupid ecchi moments and it has something wrong with her face, ugly and unlikable enemy designs, random side characters that have so-called stylized designs, which still doesn't make them any good.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, there is a character so bad, that I was ashamed each time she was on screen. It was that stupid doctor. Everything, even the stupid name, is wrong with her. She has one of the most god awful designs I've ever seen in anime, with horrible color combinations, with cliche personality and even bad back story. And you can bundle the other doctor friend/villain with her, just as bad. God, I hate them both so much.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, despite all that is wrong with it, it still made me watch a little more and I had on and off fun on few these episodes. In other words, not a complete trash, it even manages to be perfectly average sometimes.",
