            "content": "Growing up is not an easy process, and there are always moments that one looks back upon with a sense of embarrassment and regret. One might ask what it is that truly marks the transition into adulthood: the ability to live independently, or maybe the conformity and adherence to social norms. Are the people who remain true to their childhood interests not grown up, then? Perhaps. But is there anything wrong with that? It's hard to say. \r\nThere's a strange term used in Japanese internet culture. \"Chuunibyou\", or more literally \"Eighth-Grade Syndrome\", refers to matured individuals with an absurd self-created persona. Remember the times asa child when there was a TV character you found appealing and you pretended to possess their superhuman abilities in real-life? A chuunibyou is a teenage or adult form of that, but to such an extent that the fictional persona defines their entire lifestyle. Certainly, behaving this way in public would make for some embarrassment, and recovering from such a past even more so. \\n\\n\r\nPoor Yuuta. \\n\\n\r\nIt's an experience that he knows all too well. After suffering from chuunibyou throughout middle school as the \"Dark Flame Master\", he makes the decision to move on from the past and attempt to live his highschool years as a normal student. To ensure victory and start anew, Yuuta applies to a high school where none of his middle school classmates are attending. It may have been a successful plan, too, if not for the unusual appearance of a beautiful girl on his balcony. \\n\\n\r\nHer name is Takanashi Rikka, a current chuunibyou, representing everything that Yuuta used to be and desired to forget. Worse, she recently moved into the same apartment complex and overheard Yuuta's last days as the Dark Flame Master, ensuring that it is not a past he will escape so easily. He unwillingly gained Rikka's interest in him as a result, and his attempts to make a pleasant first impression at his new high school are interrupted by Rikka's chuunibyou provocations. The fact that Yuuta wants to forget and start anew is irrelevant, because for her their relationship is a destiny revealed through her \"Wicked Eye\". Perhaps she wasn't entirely false, either, occult terminology aside. \\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai, shortened to Chuu2-Byo, is a title that stands out for the interaction between these two characters. It's nostalgic (and often times embarrassing!) to see the characters act in silly ways reminiscent of childhood, though without the endearing cast of characters this would probably seem like little more than a neat gimmick. Yuuta and Rikka are what make the anime, and their interaction is nothing short of adorable and hilarious. Both of them have substance and play off of each other in creative ways, such as Yuuta using his abandoned Dark Flame Master persona in order to cheer Rikka up when she's feeling depressed, or her playing around in awe with his old gear. It's definitely cute, and cuteness is something that Chuu2-Byo has no shortage of. \\n\\n\r\nAn important addition to the character dynamic are the side characters who each fulfill their own role in the series. Sanae Dekomori, ace middle school student and proud chuunibyou, behaves as servant to Rikka and her Wicked Eye, possessing a weapon of considerable danger in the real world: her excessively long pigtails. Kumin, a senior with a fondness for napping, and Isshiki, Yuuta's jealous male friend and classmate, also highlight the cast. The most important of these characters, however, is Nibutani Shinka. Despite initially being the only character in the anime truly definable as 'normal', she is actually an ex-Chuunibyou herself, much like Yuuta. When her dreaded past is discovered by Yuuta, she throws away any notion of kindness in order to keep him from spilling the truth. As Rikka develops her own feelings for Yuuta, though, Nibutani begins to display a much more compassionate and benevolent side to her personality, even going as far as to use her old persona to help them progress. \\n\\n\r\nAppearances often mislead, and Chuu2-Byo is exemplary of this. What seems to be a cute slice of life revolving around the chuunibyou lifestyle is actually structured as a love story. Comedy is predominate during the first six episodes, but hints of Rikka's feelings for Yuuta are consistently displayed as the series progresses. Love is an emotion that she is not familiar with, and amidst the confusion there is often an overlap between her sensitive side and her chuunibyou side, often using this persona to hide her embarrassment. It's very endearing to watch her feelings develop as she realizes that these are emotions not of respect, but genuine love. The romance is exceptionally subtle, while consequently there is no overbearing drama used to advance their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nAt least for the first half.\\n\\n\r\nThere's often a problem with drama in anime, especially since it tends to hit the viewer with all the subtlety of a speeding subway. Titles like Toradora and AnoHana are a couple examples of drama on overdrive, and occasionally Chuu2-Byo can feel a bit like those titles in the last six episodes. Is there anything inherently wrong with excessive drama in an anime? Certainly not. After all, it depends on the execution itself and other aspects such as the characterization and dialogue. But what when the drama comes from nowhere, undermining the appeal of the series and turning it into something else entirely? This is where problems occur in Chuu2-Byo. What starts out as a lighthearted comedy with subtle romance becomes an exhaustive high school drama in the second half, and it really hurts the series as a result.\\n\\n\r\nWhy change it, then? It's a question that I might never find the answer to. It's not as though the anime was lacking in substance before that point, or that it needed to make a sudden switch to develop the characters and their relationship. Yuuta and Rikka were steadily progressing, and there were still the occasional dramatic moments that felt natural to the show. While there isn't so much an issue with the execution of the second half (exaggerated crying and yelling aside), it is a problem when the anime feels like two entirely different shows in one. It might have been less of an issue if aspects of the first half still subsisted, but the comedy is unfortunately tossed aside in favor of drama. Which is disappointing, as the lighthearted character interaction is what made the first half of the anime so special. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also some other minor complaints if one were to nitpick, such as Kumin being a pointless character and adding nothing besides a few cute scenes of her sleeping, or the contrivances of some of the dramatic situations (receiving a letter written years ago at the most convenient time \u2014 really?), but on the whole it doesn't do much to detract from what is an otherwise well-written and heartwarming experience. \\n\\n\r\nOn a more positive note, the lavish production values customary of KyoAni do a solid job of enhancing the emotional value of each scene. Character designs are appropriately cute while the animation has an extraordinary level of polish and finesse, particularly during the faux action sequences often illustrated whenever Rikka has a confrontation with another character. More commendable, though, is the storyboarding of some scenes. There are a few moments in the anime that are truly breathtaking, such as Yuuta and Rikka quietly sitting together under a bridge and watching the lights of society shine and flicker along the river. \\n\\n\r\nA fundamental piece to any good love story is the presence of an emotional soundtrack, and Chuu2-Byo does not disappoint with its music. Fitting tracks are used for both the lighthearted and dramatic moments, and there is a particular piano piece that will manage to pull your heartstrings a bit whenever it is used. The opening and ending sequences are also quirky and memorable, and these songs will most likely be glued to your head for quite a while afterwards. With that said, it's always a little amusing during the second half of the series when the upbeat ending song plays immediately after a dramatic scene. It really represents the disparity of the two halves. \\n\\n\r\nChuu2-Byo is certainly not a miraculous or flawless anime by any means, but it is easily above the vast majority of anime out there (the romance genre especially). Perhaps the drama won't upset you nearly as much as it did with me, or it could possibly enhance the experience for you, even if changing the entire tone of an anime midway through will no doubt cause some concern. \\n\\n\r\nBut if I'm to be rewarded with a genuinely heartwarming story, six episodes of unadulterated fun, and one of the best romantic pairings in the past few years\u2014 is it worth a little bit of frustration? Probably.",

            "content": "I like to laugh. Who doesn't? I like to smile. A smile always brightens the day. I like to watch some high school kids pretending who they are not and cosplaying as characters like the Dark Flame Master. Oh, I guess this is the right place then because Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! can do all three of those things. Killing three birds with one stone, awesome isn't it?\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! (Regardless of My Adolescent Delusions of Grandeur, I Want a Date!) is an anime series based on the novel of the same name that is produced by Kyoto Animation. Some fans ofKyoto Ani (Clannad, Hyouka, Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu) will definitely rejoice because the Japanese studio is already well known for its rich visuals and aesthetics. They have been involved with many series with the typical high school life being turned from normal to abnormal and they did it once again!\\n\\n\r\nThe series takes place at a typical high school setting. It involves a young boy named Yuuta Togashi who is suffering a case of...chuunibyou, or \u201cMiddle School 2nd Year Syndrome\". In technical terms, it is a condition in which an individual deludes themselves as being a smartass and looks down on others. They also believe they have some sort of \u201cspecial power\u201d that excludes themselves from the normal society. It's actually quite common though. I don't know if you ever felt this way but a lot of people do weird things in high school. I mean, it's like how you used to believe yourself as a superhero like Batman or Superman when you were younger. Good days, good days.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, high school has it all: drama, comedy, romance, delusions, cosplaying, and all that other good stuff. So without further ado, let's introduce the two main characters:\\n\\n\r\nRikka Takanashi \u2013 forget that eyepatch. This girl has that syndrome I'm talking about. She visions herself with the \u201cwicked eye\u201d. (which sadly is just some colored contacts) Unlike Yuuta however, she still has the chuunibyou. She is the girl who gets the most abuse but also the one that brings out the most laughter with her absurd yet comedic stances throughout the series. Take for example..that random scene when she bounces around like crazy during the pilot episode or those Lelouch-like poses.\\n\\n\r\nYuuta \"Dark Flame Master\" Togashi \u2013 he USED to have the chuunibyou syndrome. But now, it seems that his past is haunting him once again when he meets Rikka. He used to believe himself to be..the Dark Flame Master. I'm trying to envision myself exactly what is the Dark Flame Master. Does it have flames? Is it a master of the underworld? Or is just some villian who can emit cool flames. At any rate, his high school years becomes abnormal after meeting Rikka.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not too much of a story to be honest yet. The series is more about comedy and the events that surrounds the main characters. They live their high school days like normal teens although the majority are anything but normal. For example, Sanae and Rinka has this Tiger and Dragon rivalry. They fight in absurd ways that is beyond normal by the way they delude themselves. Yes you got it, they also have the chuunibyou as well, or at least used to. Later on though, the series takes some more emotional turns with a few insights into the past, especially those into our main female protagonist, Rikka-chan.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the series is glorious like most of Kyoto Animation's other works. Its background settings of rich visuals are there and reflected upon every delusion, every action, every laughter, every  chuunibyou-like behavior. Kazumi Ikeda who is involved with the character designs of the series brings out the M in moe from the characters like Rikka, Yumeha Togashi (Yuuta's cute little sister), and Kumin Tsuyuri.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also quite lighthearted that reflects upon the comedic mood of settings and characters. When there are battle scenes though, it swiftly changes to a more fast paced rythym to make it looks like it's real despite the fact that it's just a delusion. Now as for the OP song..wow, just wow. \"Sparkling Daydream\" by ZAQ sure got their point through. The opening song of the series induces eye seizures. Every time I watch it (even upon now occasionally), the scenes flashes back into your head and makes your eyeballs follow them endlessly. Of which, the OP song is also catchy with the silly pose of Rikka-chan. The stance of  \u201c(\u03c3 O \u03c9\u30fb)\u03c3\u2190\u2196\u2191\u2197\u2192\u2198\u2193\u2199\u2190\u2196\u2191\u2197\u2192\u2198\u2193\u2199\u2190\u2196\u2191\u2197\u2192\u2198\u2193\u2199\u2190\u2196\u2191\u2197\u2192\u2198\u2193\u2199\u2190 \u201c is ridiculously catchy and there have been many parodies on the net to mimic it. On the other hand, the ED song \"INSIDE IDENTITY\" by Black Raison d'\u00eatre seems ordinary with a nice melody.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is a very entertaining series to watch. It's not like the usual harem with a pathetic protagonist who can't make up his damn mind. But rather, it involves a kid who tried to escape from his past but ends up living it now with his new friends at high school. Entertainment is not so easy to bring these days especially with a lot of already used ideas but this one here is executed pretty well in my opinion. So, give it a shot.\\n",

            "content": "First review. I just finished this so it's fresh on my mind and I absolutely must write about it.\r\nSTORY: 9\r\nWhat we have here is a typical story executed in a wonderfully original way. KyoAni blends the comedic and dramatic into a nostalgic exploration of adolescence topped with their particular charm. I found myself laughing, cringing, and tearing up multiple times throughout. It's an emotional roller-coaster, yet I feel it manages to avoid the realm of melodrama by contrasting drama with gags. It does what Toradora failed to do for me. That said, I feel the show could have used one or two more episodes toease into the drama. The shift comes fairly quick, but really, it wasn't much issue. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a nice balance. Juxtaposing comedy and drama--blending reality and fantasy--serves as an astute parallel to the theme of escapism and develops a touching story about growing up and the ambivalence toward leaving our younger selves behind.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nBeautiful. The animation is absolutely fantastic. Action scenes are dynamic and larger-than-life. More relaxed scenes are nuanced and fluid. Character designs are seriously cute (even the guys). Atmosphere is used very well to complement scenes, whether it be a tender moment under a bridge or a restless heart trying to fall asleep. The only thing that knocks off a point is the occasional usage of fairly awkward-looking 3DCG. On top of a detailed background, it sticks out like a sore thumb. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's stunning. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nThis is really just a matter of taste. I liked the opening much more than the ending. BGM was sweet and melancholic and complements scenes well. During romantic scenes, there are insert-songs which I thought were a little unnecessary.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9\\n\r\nKyoAni has turned up the moe to 11 with Chuunibyou, and even the \"anti-moe\" Nibutani has her own appeal. That aside, every character's motivations are believable. Their interactions are dynamic and the source of both silly comedy and powerful drama. It's also nice to see an MC who isn't completely clueless when it comes to romance. That said, he still isn't an expert.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there's a fair amount of depth to these characters, and for the ones without it they're nice to look at. I found myself getting sucked into these character's lives and relationships. Despite how exaggerated some of these characters actually are, they feel very real.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\r\nThis is an amazing piece of work. It looks phenomenal. It reminds me of Haruhi (primarily Disappearance), FLCL, Kare Kano, and maybe a bit of Haibane Renmei (atmosphere, pacing, climax). It hits like Makoto Shinkai.\\n\\n\r\nThere's something sweet and familiar, but gripping, touching, and anxious at the same time. Watching this series is like a trip into the past--one that's exciting and glorified and fantastic, distorted by time, but one that feels real nonetheless. It's nostalgia.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10\\n\r\nMore like a strong 9, but I'm going to round up. It's been quite a while since I've seen a series capture so many emotions so vivaciously and with such force. It builds from a very relatable theme and fully fledges into a compelling and imaginative comedy/drama about growing up. Coming-of-age stories are incredibly common, but Chuunibyou manages to establish a difficult balance between the tongue-in-cheek and the deeply sincere. The result is a piece that is as honest, real, and moving as it is funny. This is without a doubt one of the best things KyoAni has put out.",

            "content": "EDIT (1/1/13) : In the past, in advance and now I must express my greatest apology for creating spoilers of this series. I completely forgot somehow even though on my right and my right mind that it says to 'not write any spoilers', mental blank maybe or just my past acting up... But once again I must apologise and hope that you can forgive me. I will remove the spoilers for future readers and for current or past readers, I really do apologise. And without a further ado... I must add that there are some slight spoilers but not as much as before \r\nA senseof nostalgia was the first reaction I had, and what most people would. A past of imagination and fun. We laughed, cried, even danced for things that bring us joy. Being a high school student, we move on, banishing our past. Some say that our past allows us to move on and run away from it. Perhaps from fear? Embarrassment?  Concern? Maybe Maturity. But, we can never run away as it is always a part of us, it makes us a special, unique individual.\\n\\n\r\nThat is how Chuunibyou in my opinion is portrayed. As a reflection on our past and how it shaped our future. \\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou is translated as \u201cEighth-Grade Syndrome.\u201d An epidemic for people in the eight grade. A certain website states that it is a slang term depicting three different cases: The antisocial types, ones with the 'cool' factor, and ones who admire mystical powers and recreates them in reality through their imagination.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters: (9)\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou's main characters include: Togashi Yuuta, Takanashi Rikka, Nibutani Shinka, Dekomori Sanae, Tsuyuri Kumin and Isshiki Makoto (Uhh... Is he a main?)\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! depicts a newly enrolled high school student, Togashi Yuuta. A teenager whose past is what he thinks as banished from his mind, a few head bangs on his wall is an example. He enters high school with a clean slate, so he says. \"Dark Flame Master\" his faked ulterior personality due to having a different mindset of his friends. \\n\\n\r\nTakanashi Rikka. A person with a rather serious case of Chuunibyou. And is expressed by rather peculiar movements and stances that the responders cannot help but laugh. But in future episodes she experiences development of mind, heart and soul. \\n\\n\r\nNibutani Shinka, the classmate of the two above and Isshiki, relates to Yuuta in the way of wanting to forget about her chuunibyou past. She is also the motherly type I suppose and expresses this love towards other characters giving her a rather lovable personality and character. \\n\\n\r\nDekomori... Smart... but just weird. Not saying she's a bad character but was one of the most strongest, bringing powerful scenes towards the end. But either way, she too has Chuunibyou, with twin tails which are... heavy. Yeah that would hurt, right Nibutani?\\n\\n\r\nIsshiki, doesn't play much of a role but plays a good comedic role like a side character (referring to Clannad and Little Busters if you know what I'm talking about)\\n\\n\r\nKumin-senpai is an admirer of people with Chuunibyou. A rather peculiar, sleepy case who in turn plays a huge role towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (10)\\n\r\nKyoto Animation presents stunning quality in their animation. Well I'm no expert but it was truly outstanding as always. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (9)\\n\r\nAtmospheric background music is best for bringing out character development and emotions towards the viewers. Kyoani successfully manipulated music to their advantage and used that initiative to have an awesome soundtrack.The timing of the music is what I'm speaking of. The dramatic music played at the right times, the foreshadowing, comedic etc. allows people to be drawn into the same environment of chuu2. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10)\\n\r\nEverything from Chuunibyou was enjoyable. The comedy and romance both created and anime for everyone joy, happiness and some sad scenes had drawn my attention from the beginning. Chuu2 has this element that would make the haters of moe, romantic-comedic genres become entranced into this show. That element is for you, the viewers to find out. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course Overall (10). As MAL states it was just Outstanding. Everything about it is lovable. I'm out of words at the moment so I cannot explain how great this anime is. Viewers looking for a balanced romantic comedy with some drama, this is for you. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review. I had fun typing up this and being the first for this anime brings me great pleasure to do so. Please if it doesn't trouble you say if this was helpful or not, I'd like to continue reviewing if people like reading it. And please mind my English, never was good at it hehe. Thanks for reading and hope I didn't waste your time XD\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I appreciate the criticism people expressed to me. Granted some (one) of them were not constructive but I really do appreciate what people said to me. Thanks for the comments :)\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally: Reality be rent. Synapse break. Banishment, this WORLD!!",

Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai suffers from its poor writing. There are clich\u00e9s on every step.\\n\\n\r\nTake the premise of chuunibyous, which roughly translates into \u2018eighth grade syndrome.\u2019 This social phenomena is worth exploring despite the lack of attention to it. I\u2019m glad the writers are giving this attention. Some may call this Kyoto Animation\u2019s answer to \u201cWelcome to the NHK\u201d, a critique of hikikomori and depressive disorders. It can be good, albeit bitter, medicine for people still suffering from the syndrome.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Chu2koi finds delight in such escapism. Not that it\u2019s a bad thing -- it saves this work from the need of being ultra-preachy. You can\u2019t really create such a provocative work in just 12 episodes. KyoAni is a master of slice-of-life humor, as seen in the K-On! franchise. In the genre where girls drink tea and eat cake, add in crazy animations of teens pretending they\u2019re superheroes and we get a comedic masterpiece. If this work stays that way, I wouldn\u2019t feel the need to write this review.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, KyoAni apparently wanted to preach... something.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where it gets messy. I have no idea who to blame, but the writing suddenly took a dramatic turn. KyoAni is trying desperately hard to combine Chu2koi\u2019s unique humor and dramatic preaching. In the first half of the series, it\u2019s humorous. The latter half shows grim, dark melodrama. Its main characters, Rikka and Yuuta, are introduced as a dynamic comedic pair; in the end, they whine at every moment possible. Melodramatic events surround the protagonists while the supporting characters goof around. \\n\\n\r\nChu2koi is, in a word, bipolar.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of these senseless, abrupt changes in tone and mood, you don\u2019t really understand where the work is going, let alone what it is about. When the work finally gives some closure, there is much to be questioned. It feels rushed; there are contradictions and glaring plot-holes in the final episodes. Bandaging those plot-holes with clich\u00e9s just makes it worse. They\u2019re an eyesore. You can separate the final episode into sections -- and in these sections pinpoint which scene of Chu2koi ripped off from which anime. Supporting characters, who did nothing in this work, suddenly become important. One character who did nothing for the first twelve episodes except being cute became an important character in the finale. Anime-original character Dekomori fares better because she is relevant to the plot. But because she is a comedic character, she unintentionally destroys atmospheres in dramatic episodes. The script is just plain chaotic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so the confusing million-dollar question: Does this work actually have something to say? It does end with a message, but it\u2019s not convincing with all these mood whiplashes. I hear its sermon, but it\u2019s gibberish. It seems to accept the chuunibyou culture as a facet of individualism; yet, once you take Rikka\u2019s reason for the desperate escapism, it becomes nonsense. It\u2019s hard to explain what this work is saying.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s undeniable Chu2koi is a good work if we look at other technicalities. Animation and music are superb as always. Ignoring the plot, the characters are fun to watch. Their interactions make anyone envious of their lives. It\u2019s a good slice-of-life comedy.\\n\\n\r\nWhich begs the question: why did this work not stay that way? The first half is strong; the second half is just unwatchable melodrama. It is despairing that Chu2koi has so much potential. Instead, it wanted to be something like Welcome to the NHK. \\n\\n\r\nIn a one-cour show, the themes have to be focused. To diverge off and be something else is absurd. Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai tries too much to be something special, but falls off from the ladder; it\u2019s just too emotionally unstable like an angsty teenager.",

            "content": "Well, it sort of feels like a blast from the past. Kinda makes you look at times in your childhood when you played ninjas or superpowers with your friends at school when you were young and how embarrassing it would be if you were to try that now in highschool, the looks on peoples faces and stares. \r\nRight now the story hasn't progressed too much 4 episodes in, right now I think the characters are just being introduced. I can feel the romance progressing in the future and it looks promising, but for now its just a typical slice of life moe girls doing cutethings. The ability of this anime to invoke a sense of sympathy for Yuuta, when Rikka does something cute but embarrassing is pretty incredible. In my head if i were in Yuutas position I'd just like \"Oh gawd, please shtap,\" as Rikka acts out her battle with an imaginary demon king in front of a bunch of people. \\n\\n\r\nThe main reason I've come to watch this anime is of course Art, Rikka is too damn cute, god damn she might be the cutest character in all the anime's I've seen. I'm not sure what it is, her cute hair or the eye patch shes just too mesmerizing. I'm also pretty happy the main male protagonist isn't a god damn bishounen, hes just your average guy trying to be a normal high schooler. The battle scenes are also not bad, made to show the exaggerated imagination of Rikka as she battles creatures from over dimensions, which then transitions into real life as you see Rikka jumping around with her over dramatic acting out of her imagination, its very enjoyable to watch :].\\n\\n\r\nOh my, the sound Rikka makes when she gets hit on the head is moe-diculous, yeah I made a new fucking word to describe a sound. I'm also happy that her voice actress is actually pretty hot, Uchida Maaya props to you for making cute sounds when getting hit, they're not a lot of hot voice actresses and I'm happy Rikka has one . The ending song is actually pretty catchy as well I even downloaded it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters of this anime, Rikka is obviously the best, so innocent and pure minded adds to her cuteness. I feel Yuuta's pain as he tries to shut away a part of his life hoping it to never resurface, I especially empathize with wanting to go back in time to punch yourself, I mean who doesn't want to go back in time and punch themselves for something embarrassing they've done?  \\n\\n\r\nI've enjoyed this anime quite a bit, and I'm going to try to go on hiatus to save as many episode as possible so I can marathon through to experience great amounts of entertainment, however I probably won't last long because I'm already twitching to see the next episode :[.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it looks like a promising anime, I can't wait until this animes finished so I can watch it all in one go, if you want a unique anime experience or just want to a comedy of with cute moe girls watch Chuunibyou demo koi Shitai! its worth it.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes, initial impressions can be highly deceiving. Chuunibyou is an example of that.\r\nIncorporating elements of drama, moe and SoL, Chuunibyou is a superb show, displaying a remarkable level of literary and technical depth, and appealing to many different viewers as well.\r\nDrama, characterization and plot are well executed, making this show one of the most enjoyable this season. It is only around the later episodes that one truly comes to appreciate the level of thoughtfulness and sophistication that went into the creation of this show. Whilst the first 1-8 episodes seem like pointless interactions, it is later revealed to be metaphorical to the inner struggles ofRikka, the female lead. In this respect, it is even better than Clannad which, for the first half IS just messing around.\\n\\n\r\nStory and character is superb. Rikka steals the main focus of the show in the latter half of the show, reveling an interesting, well fleshed out character. Yuuta, as the level headed male lead, provides the driving push behind the plot. On the other hand, Nibutani and Dekkomori act as supporting characters, at times providing support for Rikka and at the same time assisting in her character development. Nibutani is an interesting character in that she hides part of her character. Her personality is caustic, and yet she acts as the motherly figure for many of the characters. To top it off, she, like Yuuta, is a past [spoiler], which adds to the comedy. Whilst it is true that each character falls under a specific archetype, they are all masterfully expressed and their personalities certainly do not feel overused.\\n\\n\r\nHumor is well executed, drawing on the various quirks of all the characters to provide an enjoyable watch regardless of the story. One criticisms I have is that both Isshiki and Kumin could both be removed without impacting on the overall show, although both are integrated in a way that is hardly obtrusive to the developments of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected from KyoAni, art and sound is equally as impressive. Character design is original, with the short quick \"Chuunibyou\" scenes allowing KyoAni to show off their animation skills. Another criticism that could be added is that the art is rather typical, and there is certainly a high level of similarity in the way the eyes have been drawn. Despite this, the art is certainly superb. Shading, detail and lighting has been well done, contributing greatly to the general feel and atmosphere. Music is fitting, and the OP sets a lighter tone for the darker themes in the latter episodes. Elements of moe has been undoubtedly incorporated, and expressed mainly in Rikka(heck since when has KyoAni made anything that doesn't have moe). Although some may object, the moe certainly adds to Rikka's character, reminding us at times that she is still a (human) girl. And to be honest, I like some moe fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Chuuinbyou has been an excellent show that has stood out in this slightly lackluster season. Highly, highly recommended.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRevision #3",

            "content": "*to those lazy people who just want to see a quick summary, just skip to the end*\r\nI\u2019m pretty sure that no matter who you are, where you live, and what you\u2019re stature in life is, you\u2019ve once dreamt of the supernatural. You know, like having special powers that set you apart from others, or living in a floating castle in the sky. But of course, regardless of that, there came a time when we all decided to forget such delusions and become a proper part of the society. Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai, otherwise known as Chuu-2, is an anime that focuses on such delusions.\\n\\n\r\nChuu-2 shows us the story of Yuuta, your everyday, run-of-the-mill, high school teenage boy. Or so he seems. In the past he seems to have been infected with one of the most widespread, embarrassing, and even humiliating disease of all time, and that is Chuunibyou. Chuunibyou is something that every normal person has gone through in his life, and that the delusions that come with the developing of one\u2019s mind during the second year of middle school, and thus the name Chuunibyou. Now, the thing is, each case of Chuunibyou is different from one person to another, and Yuuta happened to have a really bad case of it, making him act out his delusions to the point of going to school in costume fighting enemies that don\u2019t exist. But as with every person, he soon realized what he was doing, and became slightly traumatized with embarrassment. So, after graduating middle school, he decided to put everything behind him, and start fresh in a school where nobody knows of his dark past. Now, here comes Rikka, a person who, even until high school, still has her Chuunibyou. With her discovering Yuuta\u2019s hidden secret, she drags him into all sorts of situations, and so the story begins.\\n\\n\r\nWith that short summary of the story, you might be asking \u201cwhat is so great about this anime?\u201d First off, it is literally one of the funniest anime I\u2019ve ever watched. Everything, from the epic fight scenes that Rikka imagines down to her reactions when Yuuto hits her in the head is just priceless. What\u2019s more is that the jokes they tell not only makes you laugh, but actually hits you right in the face. Chuu-2 shows us what we were when we were young and still unembarrassed with our delusional dreams for the future. It gives you a feeling of nostalgia, like you can almost be certain that back then, you also thought of being a hero of justice or something like that. So to make a long statement short, not only is it funny, you can actually relate to the things that they are doing, or even the way they think. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is that the plot itself was straightforward. It doesn\u2019t wander around from this to that but just focuses on both Yuuta and Rikka, the two main protagonist of the story. It shows their lives just like any self-respecting slice of life anime does, with a little twist in the middle when the anime starts to pick up speed and transform from a comedy slice of life to a somewhat romantic drama. What is really amazing about it though is that even with that transition, it still managed to stay true to its concept. At the start it was about some high school students with Chuunibyou and in the end, it still was. Even if the transition made it more serious and dramatic, the core concept was still there, and that is about these students trying to let go of their delusions. Lastly, the thing I liked the most about this anime is its conclusive ending. Although this might not be really good because it lowers the chance of Chuu-2 having a second season, it\u2019s still better than leaving us hanging. The ending left no plotholes, and is overall solid, leaving a warm and fluffy feeling after watching the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the plot itself, one of the things that make Chuu-2 so great is its characters. Each one of them is them is unique in their own way and is refreshing to watch. Rikka for example, is the main source of the gags in the anime due to her extremely unpredictable nature. She is the kind of character who is usually creates the complications and problems in the plot and is also the love interest of Yuuta. Yuuta on the other hand is more of the straight man who usually solves and stops Rikka from doing embarrassing things. Aside from that he also once had Chuunibyou and called himself \u201cDark Flame Master\u201d, which caused him to be the center of some gags throughout the anime. Aside from them, there are also a few supporting characters, namely: Dekomori, Rikka\u2019s best friend and apparent servant, Isshiki, Yuuta\u2019s best friend and a source of comic relief in the story, Nibutani, the beautiful class rep. and a school idol who used to have Chuunibyou and called herself Forest Summer, and the last one, Kumin, their sempai who just likes to nap. Now, this is where Chuu-2 really shines. The characters are just perfect for the premise of the story. They\u2019re funny, cute and most of all, relatable. Along with, the character development is also pretty smooth. It can be quite sudden, but it\u2019s not without proper cause and is justifiable. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, there\u2019s always the animation and music. Although having beautiful graphics isn\u2019t really crucial to making a good anime, but damn this anime is really animated really well. Everything was smooth, no inconsistencies as far as I can tell, and is pretty much just eye candy. And those fight scenes. Having been spawned from a Chuunibyou\u2019s imagination, it can be really over the top sometimes, but it\u2019s really good enough to rival those of some shounen anime. But of course, since it was done by KyoAni, which is known for its high quality animations, this is pretty much a given. The music is also just as good. Heck, you can even watch the anime just for the music itself, although I really wouldn\u2019t recommend it. The opening, Sparkling Daydream, is an lively and upbeat song which can pretty much give you a general idea of the comedy and chaos that\u2019s about to ensue later into the episode. The ending, Inside Identity, is more of a j-rock song which is also pretty catchy as well.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I found Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai as the best comedy/romance anime of 2012 and one of the best of all time. I highly recommend it to everyone, especially to those who have a soft spot for romcoms. But still, regardless of your taste in anime, it\u2019s only 12 episodes long, so it won\u2019t really take much time, so why not give it a try? After all you might come to like it.\\n\\n\r\nSo to provide a quick summary for those lazy people who have another serious disease which they commonly abbreviate as TL;DR syndrome, I\u2019ll just list the pros and cons of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n+Funny\\n\r\n+Easily Relatable\\n\r\n+Fairly straightforward but highly entertaining plot\\n\r\n+Conclusive ending\\n\r\n+Stays true to its concept/doesn\u2019t try to be what it isn\u2019t\\n\\n\r\n-Due to the story being straightforward, the plot can be somehow predictable\\n\r\n-If you hate moe, you might not like this\\n\r\n-Can cause hysterical laughter which leads to lightheadedness and stomachaches\\n\\n\r\n~First and foremost, thanks for reading my review. If you have any comments regarding my review or just want to have a discussion, then leave a comment at my page. I will greatly appreciate it. =)~\\n",

            "content": "After watching a few episodes, I felt that it was necessary to review it. So far, this anime has been like a dream, coming and going almost instantly, just like the theme of youth and adolescence that comes and goes. It hits me that this anime is somewhat different. It's like, if you mixed your run of the mill slice of life anime, and baked at 400 degrees for twelve minutes, and then sprinkled in a cup of action, this is what you would get. If you came to watch the action, unfortunately, you may be disappointed. Because there just isn't that much. You geta couple of minutes of it per episode, but it's not the main focus. What truly makes this anime stand out in my mind is the fluid transitions between the fantasy-like action and the relatively normal high school life. \\n\\n\r\nEverything is what you would come to expect of Kyoto Animation. The animation quality is high, the music is well selected and well done, and the characters are endearing in their own weird way. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality and art looks great. As expected from KyoAni, there is a lot of detail in the backgrounds, and very fluid animations. The OP is awesome. Especially the finger twirling. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound matches the scenes well. There's no strange dissonance from the scene and the music. The sounds draws you into the scenes more, rather than push you out.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters look very average (except Rikka), but their characterization sets them apart from the average slice of life. KyoAni seems prone to make male protagonists that complain a lot, and Togashi is no exception. With Togashi playing the straight man, and Rikka up to her usual antics, this duo makes this anime very enjoyable. The characters that eventually come along, Sanae, Tsuyuri,  and Nibutani, creates an interesting mix of those stuck in eighth grader syndrome, those who want to forget about their eighth grader syndrome, and those who look like they never had anything to do with it in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nEven above the characters, I think the reason that I would rate it so highly right at the beginning is the lesson that it teaches, and how it reflects on these characters. We have Togashi, who tries to forget his pretend identity, the Dark Flame Master, and Rikka, who is still consumed by her power, the Tyrant's eye. Although embarrassing for Togashi, it's obvious right away that it's very enjoyable for Rikka. I would relate this to growing up, really. There are those who try to grow up as soon as they can, those who stay as children for a bit longer, and those who never really grow up. Look how fun and interesting life is for those who keep their imagination and sense of wonder alive. But, unfortunately, time moves on, and eventually, you're expected to grow up, and many do. So, the valuable lesson this show teaches, is that you should stay a kid, and enjoy being a kid for as long as you can. Those carefree years full of wonder and intrigue is extremely valuable, and often, you can never get them back. So cherish it, and don't be in a hurry to grow up.\\n",

            "content": "Ok where only 3 episodes in  but i felt like talking about this anime as im waiting for others to be subbed right now. Anyways Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai is a typical comedy, school life anime that leans toward a harem genre. Its selling point is the theme revolving around chuunibyous as stated by the title. For those who do not know wat chuunibyous are, it literally means \"eighth grade syndrom\", basically meaning a short period of time when a person is heavily influenced by something (generally anime) and  believe they are a mythical existence or have supernatural powers (ex. Kobato Hasegawaof Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai). Now for the rundown\\n\\n\r\nStory: NA\\n\r\nNothing so far as they are only 3 episodes in and i don't want to ruin what happens for those that haven't watched the anime yet.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nGood art as clear effort can be seen put into the anime. You won't see heavy recycling of scenes like for those low budget animes. Effects for there action skits are really well done which is surprising for school life anime and a hell of a lot better than the ones seen in some action anime that recently came out... cough cough... Campione. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nNice BGM that fits well with the atmosphere of the anime. Loving the op and ending, especially the ending as its now one of my favourite anime songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nHonestly average character designs in my opinion but there still cute and made memorable by their individual personalities and character traits. But then there's the main character who, i guess following the current trend of main characters in school life, looks pretty dam normal (looks way better and interesting in the flash backs he has). Good voice acting and nice pronunciation of english words(in that japanese way of course) though. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nSo far I'm really enjoying the anime so far. It really makes me nostalgic as I had my own chunnibyou period when I was a kid and just writing about it makes me wana bang my head into the wall just to forg...just a minute...\\n\r\nok back so ya really enjoyable watch for those who want a comical, easygoing, eye pleasing anime to help us with our emotional outbreaks after watching some of the really intense series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nReally promising so far and i definitely recommend for others to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review so sorry for the awkwardness if you noticed it. Thanks for reading till the end for those with enough patients to go through my personal thoughts of the anime and for those who thought it was a bunch of nonsense from a guy that has no idea what he is talking about... well anyways have fun watching the anime guys.\\n\\n",

Fucking moe, man.\r\nSounds: 8/10 loli voiced by someone else than Kugimiya Rie, not a smart move.\r\nEnjoyment: moe = masterpiece of entertainment, moe = made of enjoyment. I also worship this anime and Mr. Peter is my favorite drink.\r\nSeriously said. Theending theme sounds good and the animation is cool during action scenes. The character design is ugly and all the characters are moeblobs. Comedy is often meh and nothing much happens beyond characters existing in their moest moe-form. If you aren't fan of moe then do not watch because then you won't appreciate this. I can enjoy moe, but there is a certain limit of how much I can bear. In Koi ga Shitai's case it's like you order a cheese sandwich, but instead of getting it with cheese slices they bring the whole fucking cheese and tell you to eat it. It's appalling, not tasty.

            "content": "Once upon a time, there was a really good friend of mine from middle school. Let\u2019s call him Jim. One day Jim came to the brilliant conclusion that he was on the brink of something amazing: becoming a super sayin. Mesmerized by his words of stupidity, we all gathered around as Jim concentrated and let out this loud, flamboyant scream for what seemed like 10 minutes and in the end\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026well\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.let\u2019s just say his parents had buy a new rug for the classroom.\r\nNow you might be asking yourself, what does that stupid story have to do with Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!? Well everything actually becauseit turns out that Jim was a victim of what I now know as Chuunibyou, or 8th Grade Syndrome. Chuunibyou is a condition where, during a child\u2019s adolescence, they will start to mix fantasy with reality and it\u2019s this condition that the entire series revolves around. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nOur main protagonist Yuta (someone who HAD Chuunibyou in middle school) hopes to start fresh when he enters high school because of his utter embarrassment at who he thought he was and what he could do. These plans get quickly smashed when he runs into Rikka (someone who still HAS Chuunibyou) who becomes attached to him only to serve as a constant, embarrassing reminder of who he once thought he was.\\n\\n\r\nA friend of mine described this series as \u201cthat of a delusional loli and a normal boy who takes pity on her.\u201d And I think,for the first 5 episodes, that\u2019s pretty accurate. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on, however, we discover more about Rikka and realize that her delusions aren\u2019t that of someone who is confusing fantasy and reality, but rather someone who is using fantasy to escape from reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe show exemplifies good pacing as every episode will either leave you in suspense or satisfied. Being a slice of life, school setting anime, the series has its fair share of drama, romance and a wide variety of humor that makes you laugh and moments that will make you cry manly tears when its suppose to. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nYuta seems as normal as they come but he\u2019s not one of those typical, I\u2019m bland, I can\u2019t make up my mind type of normal characters. He gets annoyed, has delusions and gets a crush on the prettiest girl in school just like any other high school boy but he is in no way boring. Throughout the series, Yuta, as he learns more about Rika as well as himself, starts making decisions which can actually affect his development out of adolescence and into maturity. He is a character that grows, learns and makes mistakes. Plus, his over the top reactions to him being glorified as the \u201cDark Flame Master\u201d (His Chuunibyou counterpart) are one of the main highlights of the series but that\u2019s not his only role. \\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Rika. This girl is so cute I think needs her own Moe archetype. Despite the fact that she acts like she\u2019s some kind of supernatural being with the powers of darkness, there are also times were she acts like\u2026well\u2026a normally innocent, shy teenage girl and while the series is mainly done from Yutas normal point of view, every now and then we\u2019ll see things from Rikas Chuunibyou perspective. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that these two are the protagonists doesn\u2019t make any part of the main cast less enjoyable or relatable for that matter. What\u2019s great about the main cast in the series is that each of them seems to represent some different aspect of aging and maturity despite most of them being high schoolers. This in turn only makes the maturity Rikka and Yuta go through more apparent.\\n\\n\r\nShinka Nibutani \u2013 she represents adulthood (she can\u2019t stand childish things and aside from being a total bitch, she is the most mature of the cast)\\n\\n\r\nSanae Dekomori \u2013 she, like Rikka, represents someone with Chuunibyou but in a more natural sense\\n\\n\r\nMakoto Isshiki \u2013 he represents a typical high school who reminds me of someone from Clannad (cough Sunohara cough)\\n\\n\r\nKumin Tsuyuri \u2013 due to her constant nap taking and earnest attempts at understanding Rikka and Dekomori\u2019s delusions, I can only assume that she represents the elderly\\n\\n\r\nThis array of cast members defiantly helps reinforce the whole them of maturity and growing up.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWhat can I say other than amazing. A great amount of detail was placed into not only the main cast but even the side characters showed a great amount of detail in their designs. \\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation's, also did a magnificent job with the backgrounds and scenery to the point where, when the stories point of view was changed to that of Rikka or someone else with Chuunibyou, I actually forgot I was watching a slice of life. The design shown in exemplifying these made up powers surprisingly looked better then artwork that is most commonly found in most fantasy works you\u2019d find today.\\n\\n\r\nThe pallet choice of color was also interesting. Kyoto Animation mostly incorporated dark colors like brown, purple and dark blue in most of the designs yet the series itself didn\u2019t have a dark feel to it. This contrast, if anything, made the series more unique and refreshing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nThe funny thing about the opening is that it actually gives you more fan service then the actual series (not that it\u2019s that kind of show anyway but you get my point). The opening is very face paced and upbeat while the ending theme seems very dark and Goth; a good foreshadow of how the series starts off happy and funny but slowly gets serious. \\n\\n\r\nTheme:\\n\r\nIf I haven\u2019t already stated it before, the main theme that this series tries to present is the idea of growing up and maturing. Everyone in life (some sooner than later) need to realize that sometimes the past must be left behind. Some of us miss our pasts, and some of us are embarrassed by them but for whatever the reason may be, excepting the fact that we must grow up and face reality, no matter how hard it may be, is something that we have to do.  This is presented strongest through Rikka whose delusions can be considered as denial to her traumatic past. However, even though the past must be left behind, that doesn\u2019t mean it must be warped or forgotten, it must be accepted so we can move.\\n\\n\r\nSo the question is: Is Chuunibyou really bad?\\n\\n\r\nNaturally as we get older, we may realize how rediculous it is to act like a super sayin. Others may think that acting in such a way is better than acting.....well....normal. Cause lets face it, sometimes normal is boring and can suck. We wanna feel special, unique, like we're more important than other normal people.\\n\\n\r\nThis might sound silly, but think about it, no matter how old you get, dont we want to consider ourselves special and unique? Isnt that were individuality comes from?\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, even when we eventually grow out of our Chuunibyou faze, the feelings we had that sparked it, the feeling of coming out of our shells and becoming our own person, always remain.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOverall, this series is one of my favorite of the season. It\u2019s fresh, colorful and original. To be honest, its almost like watching Toy Story as it lets me recal some moments from my own adolesence (for better, for worse). If you are a fan of slice of life, romance or school setting anime, then this is the perfect choice for you. \\n",

            "content": "\"Reality, be rent. Synapse, break! Banishment, this world! ....\"\r\nBehold! \r\nThe ultimate review by Dark Flame Reviewer Master.\r\nWhat? You don't know who I am? How pitiful. Well... as expected from a human commoner. It is no surprise you haven't watched this epic series yet... What!? Did you say you don't acknowledge the meaning of the word Chuunibyou? Holy Chimera, do I need to explain everything?\r\nChuunibyou, aka 8th grade Syndrome, Pubescent Crisis, Fourteen sick, Hebephrenic schizophrenia, by the commoners, is actually the gateway to the Unseen Horizon. Only those who feel it can see the true reality. This tale presented before your eyes summons the adventures ofDark Flame Master (Yuuta) and Tyrant's Eye of Truth (Rikka). However, Yuuka felt to the darkness of a common life as high school year begins. He now says that such things like magic doesn't exists and swear to never address himself by his honorable title as Dark Flame Master again. \\n\r\nHe will try to convince Rikka to believe in his new ideals, his new way of seen the world. A world were magicians and powers are just part of an illusion, part of the 8th grade syndrome. Rikka on the other hand will attempt to save this warrior's soul, and bring him back to his good old days.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the series, a lot of character development is put in action. As our protagonists struggles with their everyday school life they will change their impressions and way of seeing things. One may notice this is one of the strongest points of this anime. The dept characters have and sometimes the dialogues full of subtext carrying the message this story wants to transmit: The meaning of growing up.\\n\r\n-Specially in this period of great changes that high school is-\\n\r\nThe beginning of a new season, new friends, subjects and challenges. At the same time, it's the end of the childhood and some things can't possibly stay the same as they were when you were in primary school. Along with all these changes, comes together a feeling of everlasting hesitation, self doubt and you start to question how you really are. It's unquestionably an important and difficult step into the life of most of us, and it's impressive how just a few anime series that have as their focus high school touches this psychological side of it.  \\n\r\nThen, you might thing: If it's so complicated and dramatic how can this be a comedy? \\n\r\nWell, there is always a good side of everything, and Chuunibyou mixes both perfectly. Once again returns to the essence of slice-of-life humor, places it in an adorable environment, and proves to the world that the classical \"Cute\" is not dead. In the era of \"moe\" it's refreshing to see a slice-of-life with school girls that isn't filled with fanservice. At the surface and on the first episodes, Chuunibyou looks pretty average, besides from the great animation on the action scenes, there is nothing special to it. However, as the story progresses it starts to become clear the objective of the anime and midway through it reaches its edge.\\n\r\nHowever, don't expect too much romance. unlike the title which says \"Regardless of My Adolescent Delusions of Grandeur, I Want a Date!\" this aspect was neglected for the production during almost the entire show. But you will find out why.\\n\\n\r\nSomething interesting in Chuunibyou is that supportive characters plays important roles building the background story, as their personal memories, wishes and worries are also shared with the viewer along the story. This, although appearing to be a minor difference, helps to break with the patterned school slice-of-life with stereotyped characters so common these days.\\n\r\nNevertheless, originality is something difficult to discuss. \\n\r\nI wish not enter in this merit nor question where some of the ideas for this series came from, however, some situations were difficult to fully enjoy because they were way too similar to series that came prior it. While watching, some may do the same association I did, and recall of a certain high-school girl with similar \"delusions\" and a desire to create a similar club with the objective of researching these mysterious beings and things. An air-headed teacher would allow them to do it, and they would spend most of the time goofing around. It won't be a surprise if in the next season of Chuunibyou their club decides to do a movie project. \\n\r\nEven though, accusing something of not being original when anime is widespread over the most different genres with the most different studios is certainly a miscall. Just like this, in the matter of characters, although KyoAni uses some characteristics Slice-Of-Life fans are accustomed to, they bring together in this show lots of elements well known from their projects. A compelling storyline, great OST, voice actors and, of course, wonderful artwork and character design. \\n\r\nThis last one, plus the develop of the story and characters themselves saves the plot from being repetitive and boring just like supportive characters from being flat and just puppets of the main storyline.\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou would be perfect if it wasn't for a single planing mistake: It tries to be serious in the background but appear funny and easygoing on the outside. From the beginning producers probably knew it would be a challenging thing to do, we've seen things like this go wrong before, and as expected this \"careless\" look takes control of the show. Basically the outside setting wouldn't allow the story to develop any further nor deeper because any change in the mood of the show would get in contrast with the atmosphere they built. This becomes explicit towards the ending when the anime had to give closure to a bunch of unsolved aspects and had to rush it in a couple of episodes. It didn't worked pretty well, as so we got a second season. \\n\r\nConsequently, this 2nd season is only possible because of that. If the story progressed the way it was heading to, there wouldn't be material for a second season, it would end here and now. Whenever this was intentional or not, this just dropped the 'story' and 'enjoyment' scores of the show. After all, it still needs closure.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, worth mention, artwork and sound maintained its high quality during the entire series. Therefore, no complains with them. If KyoAni have some strong points, those are definitely part of them.\\n\\n\r\nSomeone once said that Chuunibyou is a love letter to all anime fans. We all have our \"chuunibyou side\" and many of us went through similar situations presented on the series, so it's easy to relate to. That is one of the reasons why the series received a good approval at its premier, and is still cherished by many people.\\n\r\nCharacters as well, are affectionate and easy to attach to them (besides from being astonishing cute).\\n\r\nFor me, Chuunibyou was satisfying and enjoyable. Something that was worth watching, but after the praise-carried recommendations I've received, I was expecting more of it. So, my piece of advice is: Watch it without any prior knowledge about it, besides from reviews of course (but be careful with spoilers). This way you will probably enjoy it much more since everything will be new for you. And if there is a highlight in this anime, it's probably its ability to surprise you, in many different and adorable ways.\\n\r\nNumeric score: Story- 7/ Characters- 8/ Artwork- 9/ Sound- 9/ Enjoyment- 7/ Overall- 8\\n\r\n(You do know you can check them by clicking the \"Overall\" hyperlink, right?) \\n\\n\r\n\"Be engulfed by the flames of darkness and begone!\"",

            "content": "There's nothing to see here, just another generic moe anime.\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is another one of KyoAni's generic moe anime that have little to no story, and is just plain moe + humor. They've done this style so many times, that it's getting just annoying watching them repeat the same style for each anime they do. Why are they stuck on the moe train? Do they really only want to appeal to the otakus who watch anime, not for it's story, for the character's \"moeness\"? KyoAni is wasting their talent on these \"moeblobs\", when they could be using their quality animation on biggerand better things.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, story. What story? Chunnibyou doesn't have a story. It's pure moe and humor as I said above. It has some \"action\" scenes, that really couldn't be anymore pointless, because they're not really happening, it's just in their imagination. The humor is funny at times, but really, I think I've smiled maybe two or three times during 10 episodes. It's just not that funny. The characters overexaggerate to anything that it just makes me facepalm it rather then try to force myself to find it amusing. It's not funny. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound are both fine, as expected from KyoAni. Nothing more to say here.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the Characters, this is where I'm really going to rip on this anime. \\n\r\nThe MC, Yuuta Togashi, is as generic as you can possibly think of. His personality is as generic as ever. I can really name over 50 other male MCs who act the same exact way as he does. And I can also name over 50 other male MCs who even resemble him. He's the definition of a generic MC. He's your typical, dumb male main character, who is socially awkward, and a bit of a nerd. Yep, I've never seen this before! Just as any other male MC, he wouldn't know if a girl liked/loved him if she shouted in his ear \"I FUCKING LOVE YOU, YOU IDIOT\". He probably say \"Huh..? What do you mean? You think apples are good?\" A lot of anime today seem to have a fetish to make the male MC as dumb as possible. Why do they do this? I wonder...\\n\\n\r\nThe female MC, Rikka Takanashi, is again, another generic character with no personality what-so-ever. She might as well be a copy of Mei Misaki from \"Another\", except her eye patch is on the opposite eye and she isn't gothic. But their personalities are roughly identical. And when I say that, I mean they don't have personalities. Rikka, just like Mei, is your typical obscure female MC, who's true motives/goals are obscure. Rikka isn't special at all. She's boring and she doesn't do anything funny. When she has her rare serious moments, I really can't take them seriously because I haven't really become attached to her, or seen her act like a real human being. She's like a robot who doesn't know any better and doesn't respond to intelligence. \\n\\n\r\nThe other female characters, such as Shinka, Sanae, Kuzuha, are boring too. Sanae is probably the most interesting out of all of them, and that's not a good thing. Shinka is your sterio-typical cheerleader, who is self-centered and a drama queen. Sanae is there just for the moe and comedy. Kuzuha - I STILL don't know her purpose in this anime. She's the most boring out of all of them. She's often sleeping in random places, which was slightly funny the first 2 or 3 times, but now it's just lame and they keep over-using a gag that wasn't that funny to begin with. This reminds me of Fuko in Clannad, her appearances were annoying and as pointless as you can possibly imagine. Touka, or Rikka 2.0, is as boring and personality-less as Rikka.\\n\\n\r\nI will finish this anime because it is only 12 episodes, but I do NOT recommend it. It's generic. I mean, if generic moe anime is your thing, and you don't give a fuck about character development, plot, then this anime is perfect for you. There are a lot of better anime out there than this one.",

            "content": "I'm autistic. I've come a long way since I was young. Oftentimes autistic people prefer fantasy over reality. When I was in the 4th grade, I got into Yu-Gi-Oh. Unlike most normal kids, I still couldn't distinguish fantasy from reality. I truly believed that characters in cartoons were real people. I fell in love with the little Yugi. No, this wasn't some childish crush. It was basically a hardcore obsession. I raved on and on and on about how I'd marry Yugi and cuddle with him and kiss him and have kids with him and all that dumb stuff. Yeah, stuff like this is normalwith kids in kindergarten or something, always delving into make believe stuff. But I was in the 4th grade then, and I didn't realize back then that cartoons were just drawings on paper made to move with high rez technology. I think my obsession set in motion some bullying I had to endure later on, but I don't remember as I haven't run into anyone who knew me back in the 4th grade. I didn't get out of this phase until the 6th grade. Yeah, personally I'd love to bury those memories under six feet of dirt, as they're so embarrassing to look back on (and I don't think I understood that what I was doing back then was embarrassing). Everybody has embarrassing memories they wish they could bury six feet under dirt. Everybody has a time where they pretended to be something so intensely that they believed they were some fictional character for some reason. Something like this is usually common among little kids or the mentally disabled. But...in this anime, middle/high schoolers, who should CLEARLY know better, bring this up to such extraordinary and ridiculous levels, it's not even funny. Why does this thing exist?!\\n\\n\r\nOkay. Forgive me for sounding rude and blunt, which I don't mean to be, and I'm not trying to look down on fans or people who actually used to pretend to be fantasy characters when they were young. I understand this is fiction, and I'm not trying to sound like I take this a little too personally. However, there is SO MUCH wrong with this anime it's not even funny. I'm surprised other people haven't pointed these things out yet, so I'm going to no matter what people say to me! Let me start off with the single worst thing about this show: the way it portrays these fantasies. Now, it's not uncommon for people to pretend to be anime characters or something like that. Heck, sometimes I like to pretend I'm Dilandau from Escaflowne or Usagi from Sailor Moon. Heck, when me and my friends were young, we would pretend to be Pokemon trainers and play pretend battles back when we had recess in elementary school! Of course, that was mostly because I'm autistic and because we were young kids back then who wanted to have fun instead of deal with boring stuff like school or homework. Plus, we actually knew when to be lost in our fantasies and when we had to deal with reality, even though we didn't want to deal with the latter. But our main character, Yuuta, a perfectly normal and NOT physically or mentally flawed high schooler AT ALL, suddenly decided he was some Dark Flame Master and completely took on this persona. In middle school. And acted like that. IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. EVEN DURING CLASSES. IN PUBLIC!! Do you see what's wrong here? It's one thing to be a little kid and pretend to be anime characters when we're alone, but...a middle schooler?! Acting like that every single day?! In plain view of other kids, teachers, and authority figures?! Seriously, this kid SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER!! So should everyone else, despite having their reasons for deluding themselves in fantasies! Yet what does this anime do?! It tries to give it some fancy name called Eighth Grader Syndrome, or Chuunibyo as they call it. Come on people!! This isn't some phenomenon! It's just stupid kids acting out their fantasies and acting like complete idiots when they SHOULD know better! What also appalls me is the way other people react to them! They just watch looking all weird and let them do their thing! It's probably more of a cultural thing, and I'm in America so Japan probably has a different view on this than Americans, but...seriously, if someone did stuff like this in real life, they'd be bullied relentlessly and be reminded of it for the rest of their lives, possibly to the point of making them commit suicide! I'm surprised the kids who saw Yuuta's Dark Flame Master gig didn't laugh at him or bully him or record videos of it and put it on YouTube so they could ruin his life completely!! I know that if I ever did that stuff in public, it'd most certainly happen to me since I'm not the most popular person in school! We all know what happened to Tyler Clementi here! Seriously, Yuuta should have known better than to do embarrassing stuff like that in public all the time!! Just the way the show portrays all of this as if it's the most normal thing in the world by making light of it and using it for comedy...how can any sane person even approve of such atrocities?!\\n\\n\r\nWell, if there is one thing the show does well, it's the fact that it DOES show characters who DO feel embarrassed by their past selves and flinch whenever they even run into someone they knew from those days, and that's how the show starts. Yuuta, ashamed by how audacious and retarded he acted back in middle school, even by his standards, manages to go to a new school and hopes to start anew...but then he meets some random girl named Rikka who is so lost in fantasy it's not even funny. Even Yuuta agrees with me. But unlike him, Rikka only does it outside of school (smart move!). But her antics drive Yuuta up the wall and he wants nothing to do with her. He tries to get her off his back, but she keeps on coming back no matter what despite actually telling her multiple times to back off and leave him alone. However, Rikka makes him join her \"society\", along with a bunch of other people including a personal friend of hers, and form some stupid and pointless club whose name is so stupid I can't even remember it. Only two of said members are lost in their fantasies, Rikka and her friend, while Yuuta and three others, Shinka, Kumin, and Isshiki, just go along with their antics without really caring much except for Yuuta and Shinka. But soon, Yuuta starts to discover the real reason behind Rikka's yearning to be lost in her fantasies, especially when her older sister, Touka, also refuses to get off his back.\\n\\n\r\nLet me get the other ridiculously bad part out of the way: the characters. Other than Yuuta, Shinka, and later Rikka, all of the characters, even some of the adults who aren't directly involved with Rikka's life, act like such retards it's not even funny! I especially couldn't stand Rikka's ridiculously pig-tailed friend Dekomori and her constant emphasis on \"DESu! DESu! DESu!\" all the time! Every time she said a word I seriously wanted to duct tape her mouth shut! Isshiki's nothing but a girl chasing cheapskate (though admittedly he DOES actually decide to go after one single girl later), and Kumin...oh God. She has to be the single most stupid and annoyingly bland character in the ENTIRE cast. Why? All she likes to do is sleep and act forcedly cute with her squeaky voice! That's it! And even in the end she acts stupid but for a different reason entirely! The only characters in this show who actually have their brains even remotely in tact are Yuuta, Shinka, and members of Rikka's family, and the former two only act normal AFTER they get over their silly fantasies! I actually applaud Yuuta for being strong-minded and saying what's on his mind, not being totally bland and indecisive even though he gets dragged into stupid stuff against his will. At least he MAKES IT CLEAR that he hates what he's being dragged into. Yeah, he's loud, brash, selfish, insensitive and does treat Rikka badly in the beginning, but in this case, I'd find it rather justified, as no normal person acts the way she (or he did when he was young) does in real life! I hated every interaction between them, especially the time where Yuuta shaves Isshiki's head with very pointless and melodramatic screaming and crying, and when Shinka and Dekomori fought like cats and dogs. Now, one reviewer I read about was disappointed by Touka blackmailing/threatening Yuuta into helping her fix her problems with her sister instead of doing it herself. I don't think this is the case. Maybe she DID try to help Rikka out offscreen but her attempts didn't work no matter what, so she decided to go the extra mile. That's how I think of it. But that's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nIt may be KyoAni and all, but I'm going to be upfront: their animation here looks really sloppy. Tamako Market looked better than this. The music is rather bland, the theme songs were annoying, and the insert songs were used in the wrong places. Ugh. Now, the only reason I watched this show was because of one reviewer's interpretation of it, and how the final episode shows a strong moral about being true to yourself, embracing the weirdness within, and not being happy with conforming because other people say so. Now, these are themes that I love to see explored in anime. Heck, right now, I'm in a situation where I do do things people think as strange, but I do them in moderation and I do them to be happy, not to cause anyone trouble. Why else would we watch anime and read books and play video games than to take a break from the tiresome world around us? We want to have fun, and in a way, I understand why the characters in here do the things they do. My sister and I don't really see eye to eye since we have very different views on the world and we clash a lot. I'm convinced that because of my disability, she believes I'm someone who will throw a tantrum if I even remotely do anything she deems rude and inappropriate, like accidentally say the wrong thing, and who she has to watch over every single second like I'm that kid from the movie Problem Child (y'know, the one with Gilbert Gottfried). I may have a disability, but I KNOW what to do when I'm out in public. I know how to be polite and say thank you and be appreciative and when to do something and when not to. I know all of this, yet she seems to believe that I don't and constantly reminds me of how stupid I am and seems to believe that anything I say or do, well intentioned or not, is always rude or out of malice. I don't show her the anime I watch because I'm convince she'll question my motives for watching them and completely get the wrong ideas about said shows, and I LOATHE being misunderstood more than anything. I bring this thing with my sister up because later in the show, Rikka and Touka get into a similar situation which I think IS rather understandable, and even justifiable to a degree, but I won't go further for the sake of spoilers. Sure, we all love a little fun and games once in a while, especially if it's to unwind after a hard day at work or find happiness after a really bad day. I used to be bullied in school, yet anime and manga have saved me from doing stuff like doing drugs and cutting myself. I don't mind pretending I'm in my safe little fantasy world and being lost in it for a short while when I'm alone, and I know when to keep it in moderation. But...if it's taken to this extent, then it's just plain annoying and insulting.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm NOT trying to start any backlash or flame wars or anything. I'm not trying to bash the disabled or the mentally ill or anyone like that. I'm not even trying to imply that the characters in the show are disabled or mentally not right in the head. Why would I do that when I myself have a disability? That's the last thing I'd ever do, and I'm not that kind of person, especially since I explained why I don't like this show, and I'm not trying to make it sound like I still can't distinguish fantasy from reality. I know better than that, even though I do let my emotions get the better of me sometimes, not that I mean to. We all have our strange sides here and there, and we should do what makes us happy, even though society claims it's not normal and that we should act the way they want us to act, which is basically to obey everything they say, even though it feels more like they want to put us in a box because we're flawed. So what if we want to burst out and be ourselves? That's what people should do! Be themselves! Don't hold back! Do whatever makes you happy, and don't be what others want you to be just so they can feel good about themselves. Don't be poisoned by the selfish wishes of others. I love being myself. We should embrace our weirdness and enjoy it, no matter how hard people try to drag us down. But this anime approaches it in such an insulting manner it's not even funny. I KNOW for a fact that if I wanted to write a story about an anime about being true to yourself if it makes you happy despite the opinions of others, I'd be able to execute it better than this! It's one thing to actually have people who pretend and play act for fun, and then there's having people do it ALL THE FREAKING TIME AND IN PUBLIC IN FRONT OF OTHERS, and the latter is just plain wrong on so many ridiculous levels.\\n\\n\r\nThis is fine for entertainment, but if you really want an anime about being true to yourself, stay far away from this. This has ridiculous written all over it. Sorry if I sounded too personal. Just throwing my opinion out there. That's all.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: It seems I've caused some confusion in regards to the message my review has been giving out. It seems people have mis-interpreted my review as hating the show for not being realistic even though it's just a cartoon. I GET that it's a cartoon and I DO NOT hate the show for not being realistic. Did anyone even read my review word for word? I don't judge shows for realism. That's not why cartoons exist. Heck, if you look at my top 3 shows, they're anything but realistic! I despise Chuunibyou simply because I hate the insulting and downright comically insensitive way it portrays kids having vivid imaginations and taking them to a ridiculous extreme, even going as far as not having people laugh or shake their heads in contempt. Is that really so hard to understand?",

            "content": "\"Another romance / comedy anime? And another eyepatch girl? Please spare us... \"\r\nI beg to differ.\r\nHello fellow anime fans, my name is Gillis. This is my very first anime review and I mainly decided to write it as this anime seems to have been overlooked by many, and I at least want it to catch your attention. Heck, another eyepatch girl, some may think when they see the picture of the anime. I am like that too, but if you miss this series I won't forgive you.\r\nI have been watching anime for a long time, all the way back in grade school. When I startedthere was already a lot of great classics to watch, and I was the self-proclaimed local Anime-guru back in the days. In the recent past two years though I've watched many new and old series, never finding anything I have liked (there are some rare, few exceptions). Usually I just pick up a new anime when I am about to eat and then I drop it after maybe 2 episodes. In fact, I have actually dropped over 100 series (yes more than my list) and the biggest reason is that: Either it does not hook me from the start, or it just got no story. My taste is all-round, it can be anything... as long as the plot is good, not necessarily unique. The art does not have to be excellent either. For me, as said, it's all about the quality of the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, enough of my background. About 1 week ago, as I was about to sit down and eat I was lurking around on a anime stream website and picked up a random anime I had not seen. \"Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!\". As usual I did not expect much. I just wanted to watch something random while eating my food. Heck, the only recent masterpiece I had seen most recently was Steins; Gate... and that was quite some time ago. However, as I started watching Chuunibyou I was in for a surprise. The introduction of the anime presents the interesting disease called \"8th-grader symptom\" or in japanese \"Chuunibyou\". To summarize, it is the difficult age we've been going through as teenagers where we do some really silly things that we all want to forget. As the explanation of this disease continues we are introduced to one of the main characters of the story, Togashi Yuuta, which was practically a textbook example of the Chuunibyou disease when he was younger, calling himself \"Dark Flame Master\" or in japanese \"Darku Flameu Masta\". Jokes aside, the start really piqued my interest in an instant. I want you to notice that I am very skeptical as I watch new animes. That is, until I am completely seduced by it. \\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nThe First Episode - *WARNING - SPOILERS* (Skip this section if you want)\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nNow, the episode continues with Yuuta, having a flashback of his embarrassing past and we come to realize that his Chuunibyou state is over in the present. As he goes to dispose of his past at the balcony a rope is suddenly thrown down from the floor above and down climbs an eyepatch girl named Takanashi Rikka, the other main character of the story. Immediately, as skeptical as I am, I facepalmed right away as the scene was shown to me. \"By default\" I muttered dissatisfied, recalling about 10 other animes that had started in a similar way. Anyhow, my interest and attention had already been caught by the presentation, so I continued to watch. \\n\\n\r\nRikka appeared as a really weird girl, wearing an eyepatch and some gothic clothes. Of course, weird and strange overall by climbing down from the third floor on a rope. Certainly not very original though. After this short event the opening starts and afterwards we appear on the next day as Yuuta is about to make his debut into high school and on his way, at the train station, stumble into one of the other main characters. A cute girl named Nibutani Shinka but most importantly into Rikka as well. Yuuta recalls the event that occurred the day before and realizes that she goes to the same school as he does. Of course at that moment, my skeptical sensors turns alert mode: \"Oh no, another harem romance show\". However, my negative impression was short-lived as in that moment the train arrives and Rikka opens the automatic doors with a large swing by her arm, displaying her mental powers. With a complacent grin on her face she walks into the the train in a really cute and childish manner. Yuuta, being shocked by the moment, manages to miss his train. By this little event I was already starting to be charmed by the series.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, Yuuta barely arrives in time after having missed his train. As he take a peek into his class he sees that he knows no one in there. Perfect, just as planned! Apparently Yuuta had chosen a different high school that his middle school classmates would not choose. Obviously so that he can get rid of his past filled by his miserable time as a hopeless Chuunibyo case and start a new, normal high school life. But before he enters the class he first walks to a remote area, where he speaks his catchphrase back when he was the Dark Flame Master and \"seals\" it. Though he thought he was alone, a girl could hear him. Which is with no doubt Rikka. \\n\\n\r\nBack in class he sits down and almost immediately gets on good terms with guy named Isshiki Makoto and soon realizes that the beauty from the train station, Nibutani, also is in the same class as him. What a blessing for his new high school life... only to shortly after find out that Rikka is in the same class as well. As if that was not enough, she suddenly creates a dramatic and embarrassing scene as she stands in front of Yuuta, grasping her eye under the eyepatch as she screams out in pain, saying something about her eye resonating. Under this sudden scene Yuuta realizes all too well what is wrong with her. It can only be a grave and serious case of Chuunibyo. On top of it, he is practically forced to take her to the infirmary where he once again confirms that she really is a dangerous case of Chuunibyo. Whats more, Rikka tells Yuuta that she had found out about his identity, namely \"Dark Flame Master\". Now Rikka was a presence which could threaten his new dear high school life. Correctly so, later at the day he is invited by Makoto to hang out and eat lunch with some classmates. Oh the joy! What a great start to his new high school life... but the opportunity quickly vanishes as the teacher calls Yuuta in, asking him to help Rikka home as she has lost her train card. If you recall, she lives at the same building as Yuuta. Depressed, Yuuta does as told and declines the lunch invitation. And from this moment on the episode is more or less Yuuta and Rikka interacting and getting to know each other. And I must say it is more interesting, cute and funny than you would imagine.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\n*END OF SPOILERS*\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nQuality, Plot & Characters\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nThat pretty much sets the comical and romantic aspect for the series. Being Yuuta having to take care of this impossible case of Chuunibyo, namely Rikka. And shortly after 2-3 episodes I was already in love with the series. As far as the first episodes progress we mainly get to know the main characters better, and it is actually more comedy than there is romance. There is not too much to the story neither at first, as we mostly get to know more background of the main characters. Though if that is something which would keep you bored, fear not. The comedy is really decent and as you probably have discovered, the Chuunibyo disease (8th grader symptom) is already an original part in this anime which separates it from the mass. It is an ingenious idea and the author exploits it really well to create some great comedy which made me laugh out loud a lot. It is an idea that would not run out of quality even if this anime had been made into 24 episodes or more... which in fact, makes me very angry that it isn't. Also, if it is your preference, I can tell you that the animation is really great too. And the soundtrack makes up a lot of the series. But of course, this is not all there is to Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!. Remember, I am all about the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a few episodes of getting used to the main characters, the anime switch much more focus unto Yuuta and especially Rikka. I must really say I love these two characters. Yuuta is the kind of person trying to fit in with the rest, trying to be normal and fit with the group. Though, he just cannot abandon Rikka even though she is embarrassing and acts wrong, which is the biggest reason I like Yuuta as a character. Of course, he plays a huge role in the comedy factor as he is the only reasonable person among Rikka and her Chuunibyo followers. Rikka too is the comical aspect of the series, trying to draw Yuuta in with her wild fantasies. At the same time she is also very cute, kind and a bit mystic. Though there is more reason to her Chuunibyo state than just age...\\n\\n\r\nAs said, shortly after some episodes of getting to know the characters we get to the main story line which contains a lot of romance, but also a lot of drama. Yes, drama. How I love drama. Of course it is necessary to like the characters to create good drama. You could say the first episodes are preparation for it. We get to know Rikka's background a lot better as Yuuta finds out more about her. Her background contains a lot of drama and Yuuta tries his best to understand Rikka and help her in any way he can. Although he does a lot of mistakes and it is truly touching seeing how both the main characters grow together, understanding their faults, understanding what they feel and what the other feels. Too much of this would be spoilers, but it takes a truly dramatic turn and at the end of the anime I was deeply touched. What a great show! I had never expected it when I started watching the anime two days ago. Actually I was so caught up into it that I watched it all in one night, having to face the consequences on the next day. But it was just that good. I am considering if it was worth it though, since afterwards I have been feeling really depressed. Perhaps because I watched such great series all in one night and now there is no more episodes for me to see. Or maybe I am just saddened by my miserable life compared to how they live in the series. Why can't I have such a wonderful occurrence? Or maybe I fell in love with Rikka. Which of these it is, I do not know. But what I do know is that this anime became one of my top favorites and has refreshed my mind. It is truly a masterpiece for its genre, and I highly, dearly... more than recommend it.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~\\n\r\nScore\\n\r\n~~~~\\n\\n\r\nI do not know who the fansubers for the series are. Still trying to find out who my favorite fansubers for this anime is.

            "content": "(Minor Spoilers)\r\nAs I watched the first episode of Chuunibyou, I remember saying to myself \"great...another Haruhi Suzumiya clone\" and while there are distinct similarities between the two animes, I'm thrilled that I kept watching and gave Chuunibyou the chance it deserved.\r\nThere isnt much of a story or plot for much of the show, episodes usually introduce new characters or develop existing ones by way of crazy slice of life situations. That is untill the second half of the series, when much of the shows stellar humor is traded for an impressive romance, and all star character development. While I found myself missing the side splittinghumor that got me hooked in the first place, I couldn't complain because of the touching, and impressive story that was woven in the later half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for most of the show is above average, but in several situations the creators must have milked the budget to create some truely epic scenes I never wouldve expected from a slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound was also above average, no glaring issues or complaints to speak of\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, I groaned when I caught my first glances of the characters in Chuunbyou. At first glance the female lead seems like a shamless Haruhi clone, and the male lead a bland John Doe. Side characters were familiar archtypes, the airhead, the popular girl, etc. While nearly all the characters were hilarious, none were particularly original or different. At first. As the show progresses Rikka, the female lead begins to distinguish herself as a relatively unique character, and as the story progresses even further shes fleshed out as a complete human being in an extemely touching and effective way. While the male lead isnt fleshed out quite as much, he quickly develops some unique characteristics, and his relationships develop at a believable and satisfying pace. Side characters remain, well, side characters, with some, but not much developments. Overall the relationships and personalities really shine in the second half of the show, which is where they earn their 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment of the show was a perfect 10. This may well be the funniest anime I've seen since Gintama. The countless anime refrences include parodies of yu yu hakusho, code geass, death note, and countless more I missed or cant recall. The character interactions and truely unique situations that arise are simply hilarious, but where the shows humor really shines is its shameless exaggeration of everyday events. In the mind of the female lead even sneaking out and being caught by her sister becomes an epic battle of good and evil, and everything from unlocking a door to getting on a train ends up as a hilarious, over-the-top joke, reference, or parody. In short, the shows humor is all-star, oscar worthy, and downright side splitting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, thanks to a hilarious, if at times cliche cast, touching romance, character development, and over the top hilarious humor, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! earns a solid 9/10 as well as my eager reccomendation.",

            "content": "The title suggests it to be a random anime, the beginning gives you the image of a random goofy comedy anime honestly i didn't expect much out of this anime but it all changed once i began watching this series.\r\n5 episodes into the series all this begins to change and the story becomes more emotional and heartwarming and at sometimes gives you a nostalgic feeling of how it felt like when we were kids.\r\n\"Chuunibyou\", i looked up what it meant on Google and this was the answer that i found: \r\n\"A Japanese slang term which roughly translates to \"Middle School 2nd Year Syndrome\". People withchuunibyou either act like a know-it-all adult and look down on real ones, or believe they have special powers unlike others.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a common stage in growth; for most people, it happens--you guessed it--around the 2nd year of middle school (Grade 8 in Japan). However, the problem is, there are some grown-ups who have this symptom.\"\\n\\n\r\nJust looking up this meaning made me grin like from ear to ear you know why?\\n\r\nBecause it was something that most of us have experienced in our school lives, whether it be in a severe form of mimicking your favorite TV character or in a cooler form of trying to be a wannabe music artist and developing newer ways to look good like your idol. In any case when we remember this some of us just smile and think \"that was fun\" and some of us think \"i wish i had never done that, i just want to roll over and die\".\\n\\n\r\nNow coming to the anime what does the above written extra info have to do with the anime?? EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe entire series is about a boy named Yuuta Togashi who has overcome his chuunibyou and Rika Takanashi who is still going through it somehow. The two meet each other on the night before their 1st day of highschool only to meet in the same classroom. Rika contacts Yuuta and calls him Dark Flame Master (Yuuta's former alter ego) and tells him that she has a wicked eye which is responding to his dark aura and she wants to form a contract with him, this makes Yuuta embarassed but somehow the two become friends a nd are drwan to each other.\\n\\n\r\nWell that was the gist of the story of the anime but now we come to the main point that why should you watch this anime??\\n\\n\r\nwell its simple............. Its amazing!\\n\\n\r\nWhen one looks at Yuuta's character he/she is reminded of their own phase of childhood imagination. The plot turns really do remind you of the points and realizations that made you stop with your imagination. \\n\r\nThis anime will get you in the heart, it will make you laugh, will make you emotional and remember your own childhood and bring back memories that seem like a distant dream, and make you wish you could be a child again.\\n\\n\r\nWATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!",

            "content": "My first response to Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! was an eye-roll. I predicted the plot in my head, guy tries to forget past, meets girl, remembers past. Falls in love. Yawn. Let's move on right?\r\nWell perhaps my first impression wasn't too far off the bat. \r\nCertainly, the first episodes of Chuu2-Byo presented itself in a very unique fashion, it's rich humor and fantastic character chemistry made me want to punch past me for thinking something so horrid about this show.\r\nWe are first introduced to Yuuta Togashi, a chuunibyou victim and survivor, we see him frantically try to get rid of any evidence that hispast ever existed. Dark Flame Master who? He even goes so far as to pick a High School that none of his old classmates will go to because frankly, it's just that embarrassing. We can all relate right? Everybody has done something so embarrassing that it haunts and terrorizes us to this very day.\\n\r\nIf I'm honest, there was no reason to dislike Yuuta.. his thoughts are animated hilariously and most of his conversations flow fairly well, the anime did a very good job in making us actually feel sorry for him that every time he gets a blast of his past I have to pause and squirm WITH him.\\n\r\nSo when Yuuta finally throws out the boxes and thinks he's off to live a normal life, someone far from normal appears in the apartment above.\\n\r\nTakanashi Rikka - a girl under deep deep case of Chuunibyou (or Eighth-Grade Syndrome), literally a representation of everything Yuuta wants to throw out, crosses paths with our protagonist to the point they are even in the same club.\\n\r\nUnconsciously or not, Yuuta cannot get rid of her and takes a special interest even though he claims he wants nothing to do with her. The audience is then introduced to their amusing interactions on a day to day basis.\\n\r\nTheir relationship is nothing short but cute, the two characters ooze dynamics in most scenes with their playful bickering and their almost automatic responses to each other like some sort of reflex. Their very subtle hints of affections and sincere feelings for each other never grows old... or does it?\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the last 6 episodes fail to completely tie everything in... Chuu2-Byo gets.. well.. to be point-blank - tiring. All of the characters, Dekomori, Isshiki, Nibutani and even Kumin brought a special flare to the screen that made most episodes entertaining.\\n\r\nBut some of these antics just get too repetitive. Okay, we get it, you sleep a lot.. and so...?\\n\\n\r\nThen, out of thin air, things go for a(n over) dramatic turn, its progress, climax and 'ending' falls flat and in return, results into something very underwhelming. Due to the lack of material the audience is given, it provides us with a weak impact. Leaving you with a.. \"Huh? That's it?\"\\n\r\nThings get too exaggerated that it almost made me dumbfounded - how in the hell did we get to here? It wasn't even some sort of plot-twist or shocker, it was almost as if a bunch of writers had different ideas and routes and decided to just do all of them. Such out of character and sudden nonsense appeared out of nowhere, like desperate efforts to make this show somehow substantial. But its conclusion is this: disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nWe see a different side to Rikka that yes, allows us to empathise with her.\\n\r\nReality is a bitter truth and life in general, is hard to cope with when you have to accept things that would be a lot easier if it never happened. So you force yourself to create your own bubble, your own safety net because you just don't want to get hurt. You don't want to get sad. That is how Rikka chooses to survive - chuunibyou. What comes off as a childish dream is actually a desperate cry for help.\\n\r\nIf only the show had developed that idea deeper it would have actually gotten somewhere.\\n\r\nInstead we get the girl who sleeps a lot to basically SPELL things out for our beloved, Yuuta. And I have to question, what was the point of Sanae except to be some moe to join the chuunibyou club? I'm sure KyoAni hoped her resolution to influence our feelings somewhat but instead, came across as if it was an April Fools Prank this whole time.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not impossible to develop a light-hearted, teenage love story into something possibly a bit more dramatic, a bit more emotional. \\n\r\nBut not like this. Not receiving-a-letter-from-yourself-2-years-ago way. The clich\u00e9d and unoriginal plot add-ons were not necessary. I'm sure it tried to be more heart-wrenching to make the show a bit more memorable, it's not wrong for them to try something different than the main focus of the show, but they shot the arrow too fast, too far and honestly - how do you expect your audience to be moved by pointless crying by a pointless character?\\n\\n\r\nIf I really had to complain about one tiny thing it would be the fact the anime did no justice to a perfectly good character. Nibutani seemed to be one of the few in this anime who reflected an actual human being with some sort of substance and was how the story even managed to progress in the first place, but was wasted for a very lackluster ending.\\n\\n\r\nIt seemed to me, the anime tried to be profound and meaningful, but it lacked the means - the shoe just did not fit. Rather than coming across as having a new mature perceptive on reality, all it did was bring the characters to square one and if possible, made the whole notion even more immature and naive than it already was. By the end of it, all I could think of was - God, get a grip.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my criticism, it isn't a terrible show by any standard. In fact, it IS enjoyable. It IS appealing. The humor was tasteful, the romance was charming. But even though the first few episodes weren't ground-breaking, it still deserved much more than to be given such an unsatisfactory ending.",

            "content": "Growing up is not an easy process, and there are always moments that one looks back upon with a sense of embarrassment and regret. One might ask what it is that truly marks the transition into adulthood: the ability to live independently, or maybe the conformity and adherence to social norms. Are the people who remain true to their childhood interests not grown up, then? Perhaps. But is there anything wrong with that? It's hard to say. \r\nThere's a strange term used in Japanese internet culture. \"Chuunibyou\", or more literally \"Eighth-Grade Syndrome\", refers to matured individuals with an absurd self-created persona. Remember the times asa child when there was a TV character you found appealing and you pretended to possess their superhuman abilities in real-life? A chuunibyou is a teenage or adult form of that, but to such an extent that the fictional persona defines their entire lifestyle. Certainly, behaving this way in public would make for some embarrassment, and recovering from such a past even more so. \\n\\n\r\nPoor Yuuta. \\n\\n\r\nIt's an experience that he knows all too well. After suffering from chuunibyou throughout middle school as the \"Dark Flame Master\", he makes the decision to move on from the past and attempt to live his highschool years as a normal student. To ensure victory and start anew, Yuuta applies to a high school where none of his middle school classmates are attending. It may have been a successful plan, too, if not for the unusual appearance of a beautiful girl on his balcony. \\n\\n\r\nHer name is Takanashi Rikka, a current chuunibyou, representing everything that Yuuta used to be and desired to forget. Worse, she recently moved into the same apartment complex and overheard Yuuta's last days as the Dark Flame Master, ensuring that it is not a past he will escape so easily. He unwillingly gained Rikka's interest in him as a result, and his attempts to make a pleasant first impression at his new high school are interrupted by Rikka's chuunibyou provocations. The fact that Yuuta wants to forget and start anew is irrelevant, because for her their relationship is a destiny revealed through her \"Wicked Eye\". Perhaps she wasn't entirely false, either, occult terminology aside. \\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai, shortened to Chuu2-Byo, is a title that stands out for the interaction between these two characters. It's nostalgic (and often times embarrassing!) to see the characters act in silly ways reminiscent of childhood, though without the endearing cast of characters this would probably seem like little more than a neat gimmick. Yuuta and Rikka are what make the anime, and their interaction is nothing short of adorable and hilarious. Both of them have substance and play off of each other in creative ways, such as Yuuta using his abandoned Dark Flame Master persona in order to cheer Rikka up when she's feeling depressed, or her playing around in awe with his old gear. It's definitely cute, and cuteness is something that Chuu2-Byo has no shortage of. \\n\\n\r\nAn important addition to the character dynamic are the side characters who each fulfill their own role in the series. Sanae Dekomori, ace middle school student and proud chuunibyou, behaves as servant to Rikka and her Wicked Eye, possessing a weapon of considerable danger in the real world: her excessively long pigtails. Kumin, a senior with a fondness for napping, and Isshiki, Yuuta's jealous male friend and classmate, also highlight the cast. The most important of these characters, however, is Nibutani Shinka. Despite initially being the only character in the anime truly definable as 'normal', she is actually an ex-Chuunibyou herself, much like Yuuta. When her dreaded past is discovered by Yuuta, she throws away any notion of kindness in order to keep him from spilling the truth. As Rikka develops her own feelings for Yuuta, though, Nibutani begins to display a much more compassionate and benevolent side to her personality, even going as far as to use her old persona to help them progress. \\n\\n\r\nAppearances often mislead, and Chuu2-Byo is exemplary of this. What seems to be a cute slice of life revolving around the chuunibyou lifestyle is actually structured as a love story. Comedy is predominate during the first six episodes, but hints of Rikka's feelings for Yuuta are consistently displayed as the series progresses. Love is an emotion that she is not familiar with, and amidst the confusion there is often an overlap between her sensitive side and her chuunibyou side, often using this persona to hide her embarrassment. It's very endearing to watch her feelings develop as she realizes that these are emotions not of respect, but genuine love. The romance is exceptionally subtle, while consequently there is no overbearing drama used to advance their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nAt least for the first half.\\n\\n\r\nThere's often a problem with drama in anime, especially since it tends to hit the viewer with all the subtlety of a speeding subway. Titles like Toradora and AnoHana are a couple examples of drama on overdrive, and occasionally Chuu2-Byo can feel a bit like those titles in the last six episodes. Is there anything inherently wrong with excessive drama in an anime? Certainly not. After all, it depends on the execution itself and other aspects such as the characterization and dialogue. But what when the drama comes from nowhere, undermining the appeal of the series and turning it into something else entirely? This is where problems occur in Chuu2-Byo. What starts out as a lighthearted comedy with subtle romance becomes an exhaustive high school drama in the second half, and it really hurts the series as a result.\\n\\n\r\nWhy change it, then? It's a question that I might never find the answer to. It's not as though the anime was lacking in substance before that point, or that it needed to make a sudden switch to develop the characters and their relationship. Yuuta and Rikka were steadily progressing, and there were still the occasional dramatic moments that felt natural to the show. While there isn't so much an issue with the execution of the second half (exaggerated crying and yelling aside), it is a problem when the anime feels like two entirely different shows in one. It might have been less of an issue if aspects of the first half still subsisted, but the comedy is unfortunately tossed aside in favor of drama. Which is disappointing, as the lighthearted character interaction is what made the first half of the anime so special. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also some other minor complaints if one were to nitpick, such as Kumin being a pointless character and adding nothing besides a few cute scenes of her sleeping, or the contrivances of some of the dramatic situations (receiving a letter written years ago at the most convenient time \u2014 really?), but on the whole it doesn't do much to detract from what is an otherwise well-written and heartwarming experience. \\n\\n\r\nOn a more positive note, the lavish production values customary of KyoAni do a solid job of enhancing the emotional value of each scene. Character designs are appropriately cute while the animation has an extraordinary level of polish and finesse, particularly during the faux action sequences often illustrated whenever Rikka has a confrontation with another character. More commendable, though, is the storyboarding of some scenes. There are a few moments in the anime that are truly breathtaking, such as Yuuta and Rikka quietly sitting together under a bridge and watching the lights of society shine and flicker along the river. \\n\\n\r\nA fundamental piece to any good love story is the presence of an emotional soundtrack, and Chuu2-Byo does not disappoint with its music. Fitting tracks are used for both the lighthearted and dramatic moments, and there is a particular piano piece that will manage to pull your heartstrings a bit whenever it is used. The opening and ending sequences are also quirky and memorable, and these songs will most likely be glued to your head for quite a while afterwards. With that said, it's always a little amusing during the second half of the series when the upbeat ending song plays immediately after a dramatic scene. It really represents the disparity of the two halves. \\n\\n\r\nChuu2-Byo is certainly not a miraculous or flawless anime by any means, but it is easily above the vast majority of anime out there (the romance genre especially). Perhaps the drama won't upset you nearly as much as it did with me, or it could possibly enhance the experience for you, even if changing the entire tone of an anime midway through will no doubt cause some concern. \\n\\n\r\nBut if I'm to be rewarded with a genuinely heartwarming story, six episodes of unadulterated fun, and one of the best romantic pairings in the past few years\u2014 is it worth a little bit of frustration? Probably.",

I like to watch some high school kids pretending who they are not and cosplaying as characters like the Dark Flame Master. Oh, I guess this is the right place then because Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! can do all three of those things. Killing three birds with one stone, awesome isn't it?\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! (Regardless of My Adolescent Delusions of Grandeur, I Want a Date!) is an anime series based on the novel of the same name that is produced by Kyoto Animation. Some fans ofKyoto Ani (Clannad, Hyouka, Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu) will definitely rejoice because the Japanese studio is already well known for its rich visuals and aesthetics. They have been involved with many series with the typical high school life being turned from normal to abnormal and they did it once again!\\n\\n\r\nThe series takes place at a typical high school setting. It involves a young boy named Yuuta Togashi who is suffering a case of...chuunibyou, or \u201cMiddle School 2nd Year Syndrome\". In technical terms, it is a condition in which an individual deludes themselves as being a smartass and looks down on others. They also believe they have some sort of \u201cspecial power\u201d that excludes themselves from the normal society. It's actually quite common though. I don't know if you ever felt this way but a lot of people do weird things in high school. I mean, it's like how you used to believe yourself as a superhero like Batman or Superman when you were younger. Good days, good days.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, high school has it all: drama, comedy, romance, delusions, cosplaying, and all that other good stuff. So without further ado, let's introduce the two main characters:\\n\\n\r\nRikka Takanashi \u2013 forget that eyepatch. This girl has that syndrome I'm talking about. She visions herself with the \u201cwicked eye\u201d. (which sadly is just some colored contacts) Unlike Yuuta however, she still has the chuunibyou. She is the girl who gets the most abuse but also the one that brings out the most laughter with her absurd yet comedic stances throughout the series. Take for example..that random scene when she bounces around like crazy during the pilot episode or those Lelouch-like poses.\\n\\n\r\nYuuta \"Dark Flame Master\" Togashi \u2013 he USED to have the chuunibyou syndrome. But now, it seems that his past is haunting him once again when he meets Rikka. He used to believe himself to be..the Dark Flame Master. I'm trying to envision myself exactly what is the Dark Flame Master. Does it have flames? Is it a master of the underworld? Or is just some villian who can emit cool flames. At any rate, his high school years becomes abnormal after meeting Rikka.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not too much of a story to be honest yet. The series is more about comedy and the events that surrounds the main characters. They live their high school days like normal teens although the majority are anything but normal. For example, Sanae and Rinka has this Tiger and Dragon rivalry. They fight in absurd ways that is beyond normal by the way they delude themselves. Yes you got it, they also have the chuunibyou as well, or at least used to. Later on though, the series takes some more emotional turns with a few insights into the past, especially those into our main female protagonist, Rikka-chan.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork of the series is glorious like most of Kyoto Animation's other works. Its background settings of rich visuals are there and reflected upon every delusion, every action, every laughter, every  chuunibyou-like behavior. Kazumi Ikeda who is involved with the character designs of the series brings out the M in moe from the characters like Rikka, Yumeha Togashi (Yuuta's cute little sister), and Kumin Tsuyuri.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also quite lighthearted that reflects upon the comedic mood of settings and characters. When there are battle scenes though, it swiftly changes to a more fast paced rythym to make it looks like it's real despite the fact that it's just a delusion. Now as for the OP song..wow, just wow. \"Sparkling Daydream\" by ZAQ sure got their point through. The opening song of the series induces eye seizures. Every time I watch it (even upon now occasionally), the scenes flashes back into your head and makes your eyeballs follow them endlessly. Of which, the OP song is also catchy with the silly pose of Rikka-chan. The stance of  \u201c(\u03c3 O \u03c9\u30fb)\u03c3\u2190\u2196\u2191\u2197\u2192\u2198\u2193\u2199\u2190\u2196\u2191\u2197\u2192\u2198\u2193\u2199\u2190\u2196\u2191\u2197\u2192\u2198\u2193\u2199\u2190\u2196\u2191\u2197\u2192\u2198\u2193\u2199\u2190 \u201c is ridiculously catchy and there have been many parodies on the net to mimic it. On the other hand, the ED song \"INSIDE IDENTITY\" by Black Raison d'\u00eatre seems ordinary with a nice melody.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is a very entertaining series to watch. It's not like the usual harem with a pathetic protagonist who can't make up his damn mind. But rather, it involves a kid who tried to escape from his past but ends up living it now with his new friends at high school. Entertainment is not so easy to bring these days especially with a lot of already used ideas but this one here is executed pretty well in my opinion. So, give it a shot.\\n",

            "content": "First review. I just finished this so it's fresh on my mind and I absolutely must write about it.\r\nSTORY: 9\r\nWhat we have here is a typical story executed in a wonderfully original way. KyoAni blends the comedic and dramatic into a nostalgic exploration of adolescence topped with their particular charm. I found myself laughing, cringing, and tearing up multiple times throughout. It's an emotional roller-coaster, yet I feel it manages to avoid the realm of melodrama by contrasting drama with gags. It does what Toradora failed to do for me. That said, I feel the show could have used one or two more episodes toease into the drama. The shift comes fairly quick, but really, it wasn't much issue. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a nice balance. Juxtaposing comedy and drama--blending reality and fantasy--serves as an astute parallel to the theme of escapism and develops a touching story about growing up and the ambivalence toward leaving our younger selves behind.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nBeautiful. The animation is absolutely fantastic. Action scenes are dynamic and larger-than-life. More relaxed scenes are nuanced and fluid. Character designs are seriously cute (even the guys). Atmosphere is used very well to complement scenes, whether it be a tender moment under a bridge or a restless heart trying to fall asleep. The only thing that knocks off a point is the occasional usage of fairly awkward-looking 3DCG. On top of a detailed background, it sticks out like a sore thumb. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's stunning. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nThis is really just a matter of taste. I liked the opening much more than the ending. BGM was sweet and melancholic and complements scenes well. During romantic scenes, there are insert-songs which I thought were a little unnecessary.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9\\n\r\nKyoAni has turned up the moe to 11 with Chuunibyou, and even the \"anti-moe\" Nibutani has her own appeal. That aside, every character's motivations are believable. Their interactions are dynamic and the source of both silly comedy and powerful drama. It's also nice to see an MC who isn't completely clueless when it comes to romance. That said, he still isn't an expert.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there's a fair amount of depth to these characters, and for the ones without it they're nice to look at. I found myself getting sucked into these character's lives and relationships. Despite how exaggerated some of these characters actually are, they feel very real.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\r\nThis is an amazing piece of work. It looks phenomenal. It reminds me of Haruhi (primarily Disappearance), FLCL, Kare Kano, and maybe a bit of Haibane Renmei (atmosphere, pacing, climax). It hits like Makoto Shinkai.\\n\\n\r\nThere's something sweet and familiar, but gripping, touching, and anxious at the same time. Watching this series is like a trip into the past--one that's exciting and glorified and fantastic, distorted by time, but one that feels real nonetheless. It's nostalgia.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10\\n\r\nMore like a strong 9, but I'm going to round up. It's been quite a while since I've seen a series capture so many emotions so vivaciously and with such force. It builds from a very relatable theme and fully fledges into a compelling and imaginative comedy/drama about growing up. Coming-of-age stories are incredibly common, but Chuunibyou manages to establish a difficult balance between the tongue-in-cheek and the deeply sincere. The result is a piece that is as honest, real, and moving as it is funny. This is without a doubt one of the best things KyoAni has put out.",

            "content": "EDIT (1/1/13) : In the past, in advance and now I must express my greatest apology for creating spoilers of this series. I completely forgot somehow even though on my right and my right mind that it says to 'not write any spoilers', mental blank maybe or just my past acting up... But once again I must apologise and hope that you can forgive me. I will remove the spoilers for future readers and for current or past readers, I really do apologise. And without a further ado... I must add that there are some slight spoilers but not as much as before \r\nA senseof nostalgia was the first reaction I had, and what most people would. A past of imagination and fun. We laughed, cried, even danced for things that bring us joy. Being a high school student, we move on, banishing our past. Some say that our past allows us to move on and run away from it. Perhaps from fear? Embarrassment?  Concern? Maybe Maturity. But, we can never run away as it is always a part of us, it makes us a special, unique individual.\\n\\n\r\nThat is how Chuunibyou in my opinion is portrayed. As a reflection on our past and how it shaped our future. \\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou is translated as \u201cEighth-Grade Syndrome.\u201d An epidemic for people in the eight grade. A certain website states that it is a slang term depicting three different cases: The antisocial types, ones with the 'cool' factor, and ones who admire mystical powers and recreates them in reality through their imagination.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters: (9)\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou's main characters include: Togashi Yuuta, Takanashi Rikka, Nibutani Shinka, Dekomori Sanae, Tsuyuri Kumin and Isshiki Makoto (Uhh... Is he a main?)\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! depicts a newly enrolled high school student, Togashi Yuuta. A teenager whose past is what he thinks as banished from his mind, a few head bangs on his wall is an example. He enters high school with a clean slate, so he says. \"Dark Flame Master\" his faked ulterior personality due to having a different mindset of his friends. \\n\\n\r\nTakanashi Rikka. A person with a rather serious case of Chuunibyou. And is expressed by rather peculiar movements and stances that the responders cannot help but laugh. But in future episodes she experiences development of mind, heart and soul. \\n\\n\r\nNibutani Shinka, the classmate of the two above and Isshiki, relates to Yuuta in the way of wanting to forget about her chuunibyou past. She is also the motherly type I suppose and expresses this love towards other characters giving her a rather lovable personality and character. \\n\\n\r\nDekomori... Smart... but just weird. Not saying she's a bad character but was one of the most strongest, bringing powerful scenes towards the end. But either way, she too has Chuunibyou, with twin tails which are... heavy. Yeah that would hurt, right Nibutani?\\n\\n\r\nIsshiki, doesn't play much of a role but plays a good comedic role like a side character (referring to Clannad and Little Busters if you know what I'm talking about)\\n\\n\r\nKumin-senpai is an admirer of people with Chuunibyou. A rather peculiar, sleepy case who in turn plays a huge role towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (10)\\n\r\nKyoto Animation presents stunning quality in their animation. Well I'm no expert but it was truly outstanding as always. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (9)\\n\r\nAtmospheric background music is best for bringing out character development and emotions towards the viewers. Kyoani successfully manipulated music to their advantage and used that initiative to have an awesome soundtrack.The timing of the music is what I'm speaking of. The dramatic music played at the right times, the foreshadowing, comedic etc. allows people to be drawn into the same environment of chuu2. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10)\\n\r\nEverything from Chuunibyou was enjoyable. The comedy and romance both created and anime for everyone joy, happiness and some sad scenes had drawn my attention from the beginning. Chuu2 has this element that would make the haters of moe, romantic-comedic genres become entranced into this show. That element is for you, the viewers to find out. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course Overall (10). As MAL states it was just Outstanding. Everything about it is lovable. I'm out of words at the moment so I cannot explain how great this anime is. Viewers looking for a balanced romantic comedy with some drama, this is for you. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review. I had fun typing up this and being the first for this anime brings me great pleasure to do so. Please if it doesn't trouble you say if this was helpful or not, I'd like to continue reviewing if people like reading it. And please mind my English, never was good at it hehe. Thanks for reading and hope I didn't waste your time XD\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I appreciate the criticism people expressed to me. Granted some (one) of them were not constructive but I really do appreciate what people said to me. Thanks for the comments :)\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally: Reality be rent. Synapse break. Banishment, this WORLD!!",

            "content": "Suppose you watch a work that seems to have a lot of effort put into it. It\u2019s easy to tell the staff members have worked their ass off to make this work look pretty. Gorgeous character designs and backgrounds. Hell, it\u2019s possible to just watch the show for the art. Turn off the sounds and take off the subtitles from the screen. It\u2019s fantastic animation. I expect nothing less from Kyoto Animation, which has given us Hyouka gifs on our Tumblr. To expect mediocrity in art direction is an insult to the members of this talented studio.\r\nYet, prettiness is not always watchable. When the plotdives, frustration skyrockets. Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai suffers from its poor writing. There are clich\u00e9s on every step.\\n\\n\r\nTake the premise of chuunibyous, which roughly translates into \u2018eighth grade syndrome.\u2019 This social phenomena is worth exploring despite the lack of attention to it. I\u2019m glad the writers are giving this attention. Some may call this Kyoto Animation\u2019s answer to \u201cWelcome to the NHK\u201d, a critique of hikikomori and depressive disorders. It can be good, albeit bitter, medicine for people still suffering from the syndrome.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Chu2koi finds delight in such escapism. Not that it\u2019s a bad thing -- it saves this work from the need of being ultra-preachy. You can\u2019t really create such a provocative work in just 12 episodes. KyoAni is a master of slice-of-life humor, as seen in the K-On! franchise. In the genre where girls drink tea and eat cake, add in crazy animations of teens pretending they\u2019re superheroes and we get a comedic masterpiece. If this work stays that way, I wouldn\u2019t feel the need to write this review.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, KyoAni apparently wanted to preach... something.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where it gets messy. I have no idea who to blame, but the writing suddenly took a dramatic turn. KyoAni is trying desperately hard to combine Chu2koi\u2019s unique humor and dramatic preaching. In the first half of the series, it\u2019s humorous. The latter half shows grim, dark melodrama. Its main characters, Rikka and Yuuta, are introduced as a dynamic comedic pair; in the end, they whine at every moment possible. Melodramatic events surround the protagonists while the supporting characters goof around. \\n\\n\r\nChu2koi is, in a word, bipolar.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of these senseless, abrupt changes in tone and mood, you don\u2019t really understand where the work is going, let alone what it is about. When the work finally gives some closure, there is much to be questioned. It feels rushed; there are contradictions and glaring plot-holes in the final episodes. Bandaging those plot-holes with clich\u00e9s just makes it worse. They\u2019re an eyesore. You can separate the final episode into sections -- and in these sections pinpoint which scene of Chu2koi ripped off from which anime. Supporting characters, who did nothing in this work, suddenly become important. One character who did nothing for the first twelve episodes except being cute became an important character in the finale. Anime-original character Dekomori fares better because she is relevant to the plot. But because she is a comedic character, she unintentionally destroys atmospheres in dramatic episodes. The script is just plain chaotic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so the confusing million-dollar question: Does this work actually have something to say? It does end with a message, but it\u2019s not convincing with all these mood whiplashes. I hear its sermon, but it\u2019s gibberish. It seems to accept the chuunibyou culture as a facet of individualism; yet, once you take Rikka\u2019s reason for the desperate escapism, it becomes nonsense. It\u2019s hard to explain what this work is saying.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s undeniable Chu2koi is a good work if we look at other technicalities. Animation and music are superb as always. Ignoring the plot, the characters are fun to watch. Their interactions make anyone envious of their lives. It\u2019s a good slice-of-life comedy.\\n\\n\r\nWhich begs the question: why did this work not stay that way? The first half is strong; the second half is just unwatchable melodrama. It is despairing that Chu2koi has so much potential. Instead, it wanted to be something like Welcome to the NHK. \\n\\n\r\nIn a one-cour show, the themes have to be focused. To diverge off and be something else is absurd. Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai tries too much to be something special, but falls off from the ladder; it\u2019s just too emotionally unstable like an angsty teenager.",

            "content": "Well, it sort of feels like a blast from the past. Kinda makes you look at times in your childhood when you played ninjas or superpowers with your friends at school when you were young and how embarrassing it would be if you were to try that now in highschool, the looks on peoples faces and stares. \r\nRight now the story hasn't progressed too much 4 episodes in, right now I think the characters are just being introduced. I can feel the romance progressing in the future and it looks promising, but for now its just a typical slice of life moe girls doing cutethings. The ability of this anime to invoke a sense of sympathy for Yuuta, when Rikka does something cute but embarrassing is pretty incredible. In my head if i were in Yuutas position I'd just like \"Oh gawd, please shtap,\" as Rikka acts out her battle with an imaginary demon king in front of a bunch of people. \\n\\n\r\nThe main reason I've come to watch this anime is of course Art, Rikka is too damn cute, god damn she might be the cutest character in all the anime's I've seen. I'm not sure what it is, her cute hair or the eye patch shes just too mesmerizing. I'm also pretty happy the main male protagonist isn't a god damn bishounen, hes just your average guy trying to be a normal high schooler. The battle scenes are also not bad, made to show the exaggerated imagination of Rikka as she battles creatures from over dimensions, which then transitions into real life as you see Rikka jumping around with her over dramatic acting out of her imagination, its very enjoyable to watch :].\\n\\n\r\nOh my, the sound Rikka makes when she gets hit on the head is moe-diculous, yeah I made a new fucking word to describe a sound. I'm also happy that her voice actress is actually pretty hot, Uchida Maaya props to you for making cute sounds when getting hit, they're not a lot of hot voice actresses and I'm happy Rikka has one . The ending song is actually pretty catchy as well I even downloaded it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters of this anime, Rikka is obviously the best, so innocent and pure minded adds to her cuteness. I feel Yuuta's pain as he tries to shut away a part of his life hoping it to never resurface, I especially empathize with wanting to go back in time to punch yourself, I mean who doesn't want to go back in time and punch themselves for something embarrassing they've done?  \\n\\n\r\nI've enjoyed this anime quite a bit, and I'm going to try to go on hiatus to save as many episode as possible so I can marathon through to experience great amounts of entertainment, however I probably won't last long because I'm already twitching to see the next episode :[.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it looks like a promising anime, I can't wait until this animes finished so I can watch it all in one go, if you want a unique anime experience or just want to a comedy of with cute moe girls watch Chuunibyou demo koi Shitai! its worth it.\\n",

Chuunibyou is an example of that.\r\nIncorporating elements of drama, moe and SoL, Chuunibyou is a superb show, displaying a remarkable level of literary and technical depth, and appealing to many different viewers as well.\r\nDrama, characterization and plot are well executed, making this show one of the most enjoyable this season. It is only around the later episodes that one truly comes to appreciate the level of thoughtfulness and sophistication that went into the creation of this show. Whilst the first 1-8 episodes seem like pointless interactions, it is later revealed to be metaphorical to the inner struggles ofRikka, the female lead.

Rikka steals the main focus of the show in the latter half of the show, reveling an interesting, well fleshed out character. Yuuta, as the level headed male lead, provides the driving push behind the plot. On the other hand, Nibutani and Dekkomori act as supporting characters, at times providing support for Rikka and at the same time assisting in her character development. Nibutani is an interesting character in that she hides part of her character. Her personality is caustic, and yet she acts as the motherly figure for many of the characters. To top it off, she, like Yuuta, is a past [spoiler], which adds to the comedy. Whilst it is true that each character falls under a specific archetype, they are all masterfully expressed and their personalities certainly do not feel overused.\\n\\n\r\nHumor is well executed, drawing on the various quirks of all the characters to provide an enjoyable watch regardless of the story. One criticisms I have is that both Isshiki and Kumin could both be removed without impacting on the overall show, although both are integrated in a way that is hardly obtrusive to the developments of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected from KyoAni, art and sound is equally as impressive. Character design is original, with the short quick \"Chuunibyou\" scenes allowing KyoAni to show off their animation skills. Another criticism that could be added is that the art is rather typical, and there is certainly a high level of similarity in the way the eyes have been drawn. Despite this, the art is certainly superb. Shading, detail and lighting has been well done, contributing greatly to the general feel and atmosphere. Music is fitting, and the OP sets a lighter tone for the darker themes in the latter episodes. Elements of moe has been undoubtedly incorporated, and expressed mainly in Rikka(heck since when has KyoAni made anything that doesn't have moe). Although some may object, the moe certainly adds to Rikka's character, reminding us at times that she is still a (human) girl. And to be honest, I like some moe fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Chuuinbyou has been an excellent show that has stood out in this slightly lackluster season. Highly, highly recommended.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRevision #3",

            "content": "*to those lazy people who just want to see a quick summary, just skip to the end*\r\nI\u2019m pretty sure that no matter who you are, where you live, and what you\u2019re stature in life is, you\u2019ve once dreamt of the supernatural. You know, like having special powers that set you apart from others, or living in a floating castle in the sky. But of course, regardless of that, there came a time when we all decided to forget such delusions and become a proper part of the society. Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai, otherwise known as Chuu-2, is an anime that focuses on such delusions.\\n\\n\r\nChuu-2 shows us the story of Yuuta, your everyday, run-of-the-mill, high school teenage boy. Or so he seems. In the past he seems to have been infected with one of the most widespread, embarrassing, and even humiliating disease of all time, and that is Chuunibyou. Chuunibyou is something that every normal person has gone through in his life, and that the delusions that come with the developing of one\u2019s mind during the second year of middle school, and thus the name Chuunibyou. Now, the thing is, each case of Chuunibyou is different from one person to another, and Yuuta happened to have a really bad case of it, making him act out his delusions to the point of going to school in costume fighting enemies that don\u2019t exist. But as with every person, he soon realized what he was doing, and became slightly traumatized with embarrassment. So, after graduating middle school, he decided to put everything behind him, and start fresh in a school where nobody knows of his dark past. Now, here comes Rikka, a person who, even until high school, still has her Chuunibyou. With her discovering Yuuta\u2019s hidden secret, she drags him into all sorts of situations, and so the story begins.\\n\\n\r\nWith that short summary of the story, you might be asking \u201cwhat is so great about this anime?\u201d First off, it is literally one of the funniest anime I\u2019ve ever watched. Everything, from the epic fight scenes that Rikka imagines down to her reactions when Yuuto hits her in the head is just priceless. What\u2019s more is that the jokes they tell not only makes you laugh, but actually hits you right in the face. Chuu-2 shows us what we were when we were young and still unembarrassed with our delusional dreams for the future. It gives you a feeling of nostalgia, like you can almost be certain that back then, you also thought of being a hero of justice or something like that. So to make a long statement short, not only is it funny, you can actually relate to the things that they are doing, or even the way they think. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is that the plot itself was straightforward. It doesn\u2019t wander around from this to that but just focuses on both Yuuta and Rikka, the two main protagonist of the story. It shows their lives just like any self-respecting slice of life anime does, with a little twist in the middle when the anime starts to pick up speed and transform from a comedy slice of life to a somewhat romantic drama. What is really amazing about it though is that even with that transition, it still managed to stay true to its concept. At the start it was about some high school students with Chuunibyou and in the end, it still was. Even if the transition made it more serious and dramatic, the core concept was still there, and that is about these students trying to let go of their delusions. Lastly, the thing I liked the most about this anime is its conclusive ending. Although this might not be really good because it lowers the chance of Chuu-2 having a second season, it\u2019s still better than leaving us hanging. The ending left no plotholes, and is overall solid, leaving a warm and fluffy feeling after watching the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the plot itself, one of the things that make Chuu-2 so great is its characters. Each one of them is them is unique in their own way and is refreshing to watch. Rikka for example, is the main source of the gags in the anime due to her extremely unpredictable nature. She is the kind of character who is usually creates the complications and problems in the plot and is also the love interest of Yuuta. Yuuta on the other hand is more of the straight man who usually solves and stops Rikka from doing embarrassing things. Aside from that he also once had Chuunibyou and called himself \u201cDark Flame Master\u201d, which caused him to be the center of some gags throughout the anime. Aside from them, there are also a few supporting characters, namely: Dekomori, Rikka\u2019s best friend and apparent servant, Isshiki, Yuuta\u2019s best friend and a source of comic relief in the story, Nibutani, the beautiful class rep. and a school idol who used to have Chuunibyou and called herself Forest Summer, and the last one, Kumin, their sempai who just likes to nap. Now, this is where Chuu-2 really shines. The characters are just perfect for the premise of the story. They\u2019re funny, cute and most of all, relatable. Along with, the character development is also pretty smooth. It can be quite sudden, but it\u2019s not without proper cause and is justifiable. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, there\u2019s always the animation and music. Although having beautiful graphics isn\u2019t really crucial to making a good anime, but damn this anime is really animated really well. Everything was smooth, no inconsistencies as far as I can tell, and is pretty much just eye candy. And those fight scenes. Having been spawned from a Chuunibyou\u2019s imagination, it can be really over the top sometimes, but it\u2019s really good enough to rival those of some shounen anime. But of course, since it was done by KyoAni, which is known for its high quality animations, this is pretty much a given. The music is also just as good. Heck, you can even watch the anime just for the music itself, although I really wouldn\u2019t recommend it. The opening, Sparkling Daydream, is an lively and upbeat song which can pretty much give you a general idea of the comedy and chaos that\u2019s about to ensue later into the episode. The ending, Inside Identity, is more of a j-rock song which is also pretty catchy as well.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, I found Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai as the best comedy/romance anime of 2012 and one of the best of all time. I highly recommend it to everyone, especially to those who have a soft spot for romcoms. But still, regardless of your taste in anime, it\u2019s only 12 episodes long, so it won\u2019t really take much time, so why not give it a try? After all you might come to like it.\\n\\n\r\nSo to provide a quick summary for those lazy people who have another serious disease which they commonly abbreviate as TL;DR syndrome, I\u2019ll just list the pros and cons of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n+Funny\\n\r\n+Easily Relatable\\n\r\n+Fairly straightforward but highly entertaining plot\\n\r\n+Conclusive ending\\n\r\n+Stays true to its concept/doesn\u2019t try to be what it isn\u2019t\\n\\n\r\n-Due to the story being straightforward, the plot can be somehow predictable\\n\r\n-If you hate moe, you might not like this\\n\r\n-Can cause hysterical laughter which leads to lightheadedness and stomachaches\\n\\n\r\n~First and foremost, thanks for reading my review. If you have any comments regarding my review or just want to have a discussion, then leave a comment at my page. I will greatly appreciate it. =)~\\n",

            "content": "After watching a few episodes, I felt that it was necessary to review it. So far, this anime has been like a dream, coming and going almost instantly, just like the theme of youth and adolescence that comes and goes. It hits me that this anime is somewhat different. It's like, if you mixed your run of the mill slice of life anime, and baked at 400 degrees for twelve minutes, and then sprinkled in a cup of action, this is what you would get. If you came to watch the action, unfortunately, you may be disappointed. Because there just isn't that much. You geta couple of minutes of it per episode, but it's not the main focus. What truly makes this anime stand out in my mind is the fluid transitions between the fantasy-like action and the relatively normal high school life. \\n\\n\r\nEverything is what you would come to expect of Kyoto Animation. The animation quality is high, the music is well selected and well done, and the characters are endearing in their own weird way. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality and art looks great. As expected from KyoAni, there is a lot of detail in the backgrounds, and very fluid animations. The OP is awesome. Especially the finger twirling. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound matches the scenes well. There's no strange dissonance from the scene and the music. The sounds draws you into the scenes more, rather than push you out.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters look very average (except Rikka), but their characterization sets them apart from the average slice of life. KyoAni seems prone to make male protagonists that complain a lot, and Togashi is no exception. With Togashi playing the straight man, and Rikka up to her usual antics, this duo makes this anime very enjoyable. The characters that eventually come along, Sanae, Tsuyuri,  and Nibutani, creates an interesting mix of those stuck in eighth grader syndrome, those who want to forget about their eighth grader syndrome, and those who look like they never had anything to do with it in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nEven above the characters, I think the reason that I would rate it so highly right at the beginning is the lesson that it teaches, and how it reflects on these characters. We have Togashi, who tries to forget his pretend identity, the Dark Flame Master, and Rikka, who is still consumed by her power, the Tyrant's eye. Although embarrassing for Togashi, it's obvious right away that it's very enjoyable for Rikka. I would relate this to growing up, really. There are those who try to grow up as soon as they can, those who stay as children for a bit longer, and those who never really grow up. Look how fun and interesting life is for those who keep their imagination and sense of wonder alive. But, unfortunately, time moves on, and eventually, you're expected to grow up, and many do. So, the valuable lesson this show teaches, is that you should stay a kid, and enjoy being a kid for as long as you can. Those carefree years full of wonder and intrigue is extremely valuable, and often, you can never get them back. So cherish it, and don't be in a hurry to grow up.\\n",

            "content": "Ok where only 3 episodes in  but i felt like talking about this anime as im waiting for others to be subbed right now. Anyways Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai is a typical comedy, school life anime that leans toward a harem genre. Its selling point is the theme revolving around chuunibyous as stated by the title. For those who do not know wat chuunibyous are, it literally means \"eighth grade syndrom\", basically meaning a short period of time when a person is heavily influenced by something (generally anime) and  believe they are a mythical existence or have supernatural powers (ex. Kobato Hasegawaof Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai). Now for the rundown\\n\\n\r\nStory: NA\\n\r\nNothing so far as they are only 3 episodes in and i don't want to ruin what happens for those that haven't watched the anime yet.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nGood art as clear effort can be seen put into the anime. You won't see heavy recycling of scenes like for those low budget animes. Effects for there action skits are really well done which is surprising for school life anime and a hell of a lot better than the ones seen in some action anime that recently came out... cough cough... Campione. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nNice BGM that fits well with the atmosphere of the anime. Loving the op and ending, especially the ending as its now one of my favourite anime songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nHonestly average character designs in my opinion but there still cute and made memorable by their individual personalities and character traits. But then there's the main character who, i guess following the current trend of main characters in school life, looks pretty dam normal (looks way better and interesting in the flash backs he has). Good voice acting and nice pronunciation of english words(in that japanese way of course) though. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nSo far I'm really enjoying the anime so far. It really makes me nostalgic as I had my own chunnibyou period when I was a kid and just writing about it makes me wana bang my head into the wall just to forg...just a minute...\\n\r\nok back so ya really enjoyable watch for those who want a comical, easygoing, eye pleasing anime to help us with our emotional outbreaks after watching some of the really intense series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nReally promising so far and i definitely recommend for others to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review so sorry for the awkwardness if you noticed it. Thanks for reading till the end for those with enough patients to go through my personal thoughts of the anime and for those who thought it was a bunch of nonsense from a guy that has no idea what he is talking about... well anyways have fun watching the anime guys.\\n\\n",

Also school settings and the characters create a club. Very original for them. \r\nCharacters: 9/10 loli moeblob and a harem, my favorite, but there is more than one male character which is a minus. \r\nArt: 10/10 moe, almighty moe, awe-inspiring moe. Fucking moe, man.\r\nSounds: 8/10 loli voiced by someone else than Kugimiya Rie, not a smart move.\r\nEnjoyment: moe = masterpiece of entertainment, moe = made of enjoyment. I also worship this anime and Mr. Peter is my favorite drink.\r\nSeriously said. Theending theme sounds good and the animation is cool during action scenes. The character design is ugly and all the characters are moeblobs. Comedy is often meh and nothing much happens beyond characters existing in their moest moe-form. If you aren't fan of moe then do not watch because then you won't appreciate this. I can enjoy moe, but there is a certain limit of how much I can bear. In Koi ga Shitai's case it's like you order a cheese sandwich, but instead of getting it with cheese slices they bring the whole fucking cheese and tell you to eat it. It's appalling, not tasty.

            "content": "Once upon a time, there was a really good friend of mine from middle school. Let\u2019s call him Jim. One day Jim came to the brilliant conclusion that he was on the brink of something amazing: becoming a super sayin. Mesmerized by his words of stupidity, we all gathered around as Jim concentrated and let out this loud, flamboyant scream for what seemed like 10 minutes and in the end\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026well\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.let\u2019s just say his parents had buy a new rug for the classroom.\r\nNow you might be asking yourself, what does that stupid story have to do with Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!? Well everything actually becauseit turns out that Jim was a victim of what I now know as Chuunibyou, or 8th Grade Syndrome. Chuunibyou is a condition where, during a child\u2019s adolescence, they will start to mix fantasy with reality and it\u2019s this condition that the entire series revolves around. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nOur main protagonist Yuta (someone who HAD Chuunibyou in middle school) hopes to start fresh when he enters high school because of his utter embarrassment at who he thought he was and what he could do. These plans get quickly smashed when he runs into Rikka (someone who still HAS Chuunibyou) who becomes attached to him only to serve as a constant, embarrassing reminder of who he once thought he was.\\n\\n\r\nA friend of mine described this series as \u201cthat of a delusional loli and a normal boy who takes pity on her.\u201d And I think,for the first 5 episodes, that\u2019s pretty accurate. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on, however, we discover more about Rikka and realize that her delusions aren\u2019t that of someone who is confusing fantasy and reality, but rather someone who is using fantasy to escape from reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe show exemplifies good pacing as every episode will either leave you in suspense or satisfied. Being a slice of life, school setting anime, the series has its fair share of drama, romance and a wide variety of humor that makes you laugh and moments that will make you cry manly tears when its suppose to. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nYuta seems as normal as they come but he\u2019s not one of those typical, I\u2019m bland, I can\u2019t make up my mind type of normal characters. He gets annoyed, has delusions and gets a crush on the prettiest girl in school just like any other high school boy but he is in no way boring. Throughout the series, Yuta, as he learns more about Rika as well as himself, starts making decisions which can actually affect his development out of adolescence and into maturity. He is a character that grows, learns and makes mistakes. Plus, his over the top reactions to him being glorified as the \u201cDark Flame Master\u201d (His Chuunibyou counterpart) are one of the main highlights of the series but that\u2019s not his only role. \\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s Rika. This girl is so cute I think needs her own Moe archetype. Despite the fact that she acts like she\u2019s some kind of supernatural being with the powers of darkness, there are also times were she acts like\u2026well\u2026a normally innocent, shy teenage girl and while the series is mainly done from Yutas normal point of view, every now and then we\u2019ll see things from Rikas Chuunibyou perspective. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that these two are the protagonists doesn\u2019t make any part of the main cast less enjoyable or relatable for that matter. What\u2019s great about the main cast in the series is that each of them seems to represent some different aspect of aging and maturity despite most of them being high schoolers. This in turn only makes the maturity Rikka and Yuta go through more apparent.\\n\\n\r\nShinka Nibutani \u2013 she represents adulthood (she can\u2019t stand childish things and aside from being a total bitch, she is the most mature of the cast)\\n\\n\r\nSanae Dekomori \u2013 she, like Rikka, represents someone with Chuunibyou but in a more natural sense\\n\\n\r\nMakoto Isshiki \u2013 he represents a typical high school who reminds me of someone from Clannad (cough Sunohara cough)\\n\\n\r\nKumin Tsuyuri \u2013 due to her constant nap taking and earnest attempts at understanding Rikka and Dekomori\u2019s delusions, I can only assume that she represents the elderly\\n\\n\r\nThis array of cast members defiantly helps reinforce the whole them of maturity and growing up.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nWhat can I say other than amazing. A great amount of detail was placed into not only the main cast but even the side characters showed a great amount of detail in their designs. \\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation's, also did a magnificent job with the backgrounds and scenery to the point where, when the stories point of view was changed to that of Rikka or someone else with Chuunibyou, I actually forgot I was watching a slice of life. The design shown in exemplifying these made up powers surprisingly looked better then artwork that is most commonly found in most fantasy works you\u2019d find today.\\n\\n\r\nThe pallet choice of color was also interesting. Kyoto Animation mostly incorporated dark colors like brown, purple and dark blue in most of the designs yet the series itself didn\u2019t have a dark feel to it. This contrast, if anything, made the series more unique and refreshing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nThe funny thing about the opening is that it actually gives you more fan service then the actual series (not that it\u2019s that kind of show anyway but you get my point). The opening is very face paced and upbeat while the ending theme seems very dark and Goth; a good foreshadow of how the series starts off happy and funny but slowly gets serious. \\n\\n\r\nTheme:\\n\r\nIf I haven\u2019t already stated it before, the main theme that this series tries to present is the idea of growing up and maturing. Everyone in life (some sooner than later) need to realize that sometimes the past must be left behind. Some of us miss our pasts, and some of us are embarrassed by them but for whatever the reason may be, excepting the fact that we must grow up and face reality, no matter how hard it may be, is something that we have to do.  This is presented strongest through Rikka whose delusions can be considered as denial to her traumatic past. However, even though the past must be left behind, that doesn\u2019t mean it must be warped or forgotten, it must be accepted so we can move.\\n\\n\r\nSo the question is: Is Chuunibyou really bad?\\n\\n\r\nNaturally as we get older, we may realize how rediculous it is to act like a super sayin. Others may think that acting in such a way is better than acting.....well....normal. Cause lets face it, sometimes normal is boring and can suck. We wanna feel special, unique, like we're more important than other normal people.\\n\\n\r\nThis might sound silly, but think about it, no matter how old you get, dont we want to consider ourselves special and unique? Isnt that were individuality comes from?\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, even when we eventually grow out of our Chuunibyou faze, the feelings we had that sparked it, the feeling of coming out of our shells and becoming our own person, always remain.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOverall, this series is one of my favorite of the season. It\u2019s fresh, colorful and original. To be honest, its almost like watching Toy Story as it lets me recal some moments from my own adolesence (for better, for worse). If you are a fan of slice of life, romance or school setting anime, then this is the perfect choice for you. \\n",

            "content": "\"Reality, be rent. Synapse, break! Banishment, this world! ....\"\r\nBehold! \r\nThe ultimate review by Dark Flame Reviewer Master.\r\nWhat? You don't know who I am? How pitiful. Well... as expected from a human commoner. It is no surprise you haven't watched this epic series yet... What!? Did you say you don't acknowledge the meaning of the word Chuunibyou? Holy Chimera, do I need to explain everything?\r\nChuunibyou, aka 8th grade Syndrome, Pubescent Crisis, Fourteen sick, Hebephrenic schizophrenia, by the commoners, is actually the gateway to the Unseen Horizon. Only those who feel it can see the true reality. This tale presented before your eyes summons the adventures ofDark Flame Master (Yuuta) and Tyrant's Eye of Truth (Rikka). However, Yuuka felt to the darkness of a common life as high school year begins. He now says that such things like magic doesn't exists and swear to never address himself by his honorable title as Dark Flame Master again. \\n\r\nHe will try to convince Rikka to believe in his new ideals, his new way of seen the world. A world were magicians and powers are just part of an illusion, part of the 8th grade syndrome. Rikka on the other hand will attempt to save this warrior's soul, and bring him back to his good old days.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the series, a lot of character development is put in action. As our protagonists struggles with their everyday school life they will change their impressions and way of seeing things. One may notice this is one of the strongest points of this anime. The dept characters have and sometimes the dialogues full of subtext carrying the message this story wants to transmit: The meaning of growing up.\\n\r\n-Specially in this period of great changes that high school is-\\n\r\nThe beginning of a new season, new friends, subjects and challenges. At the same time, it's the end of the childhood and some things can't possibly stay the same as they were when you were in primary school. Along with all these changes, comes together a feeling of everlasting hesitation, self doubt and you start to question how you really are. It's unquestionably an important and difficult step into the life of most of us, and it's impressive how just a few anime series that have as their focus high school touches this psychological side of it.  \\n\r\nThen, you might thing: If it's so complicated and dramatic how can this be a comedy? \\n\r\nWell, there is always a good side of everything, and Chuunibyou mixes both perfectly. Once again returns to the essence of slice-of-life humor, places it in an adorable environment, and proves to the world that the classical \"Cute\" is not dead. In the era of \"moe\" it's refreshing to see a slice-of-life with school girls that isn't filled with fanservice. At the surface and on the first episodes, Chuunibyou looks pretty average, besides from the great animation on the action scenes, there is nothing special to it. However, as the story progresses it starts to become clear the objective of the anime and midway through it reaches its edge.\\n\r\nHowever, don't expect too much romance. unlike the title which says \"Regardless of My Adolescent Delusions of Grandeur, I Want a Date!\" this aspect was neglected for the production during almost the entire show. But you will find out why.\\n\\n\r\nSomething interesting in Chuunibyou is that supportive characters plays important roles building the background story, as their personal memories, wishes and worries are also shared with the viewer along the story. This, although appearing to be a minor difference, helps to break with the patterned school slice-of-life with stereotyped characters so common these days.\\n\r\nNevertheless, originality is something difficult to discuss. \\n\r\nI wish not enter in this merit nor question where some of the ideas for this series came from, however, some situations were difficult to fully enjoy because they were way too similar to series that came prior it. While watching, some may do the same association I did, and recall of a certain high-school girl with similar \"delusions\" and a desire to create a similar club with the objective of researching these mysterious beings and things. An air-headed teacher would allow them to do it, and they would spend most of the time goofing around. It won't be a surprise if in the next season of Chuunibyou their club decides to do a movie project. \\n\r\nEven though, accusing something of not being original when anime is widespread over the most different genres with the most different studios is certainly a miscall. Just like this, in the matter of characters, although KyoAni uses some characteristics Slice-Of-Life fans are accustomed to, they bring together in this show lots of elements well known from their projects. A compelling storyline, great OST, voice actors and, of course, wonderful artwork and character design. \\n\r\nThis last one, plus the develop of the story and characters themselves saves the plot from being repetitive and boring just like supportive characters from being flat and just puppets of the main storyline.\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou would be perfect if it wasn't for a single planing mistake: It tries to be serious in the background but appear funny and easygoing on the outside. From the beginning producers probably knew it would be a challenging thing to do, we've seen things like this go wrong before, and as expected this \"careless\" look takes control of the show. Basically the outside setting wouldn't allow the story to develop any further nor deeper because any change in the mood of the show would get in contrast with the atmosphere they built. This becomes explicit towards the ending when the anime had to give closure to a bunch of unsolved aspects and had to rush it in a couple of episodes. It didn't worked pretty well, as so we got a second season. \\n\r\nConsequently, this 2nd season is only possible because of that. If the story progressed the way it was heading to, there wouldn't be material for a second season, it would end here and now. Whenever this was intentional or not, this just dropped the 'story' and 'enjoyment' scores of the show. After all, it still needs closure.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, worth mention, artwork and sound maintained its high quality during the entire series. Therefore, no complains with them. If KyoAni have some strong points, those are definitely part of them.\\n\\n\r\nSomeone once said that Chuunibyou is a love letter to all anime fans. We all have our \"chuunibyou side\" and many of us went through similar situations presented on the series, so it's easy to relate to. That is one of the reasons why the series received a good approval at its premier, and is still cherished by many people.\\n\r\nCharacters as well, are affectionate and easy to attach to them (besides from being astonishing cute).\\n\r\nFor me, Chuunibyou was satisfying and enjoyable. Something that was worth watching, but after the praise-carried recommendations I've received, I was expecting more of it. So, my piece of advice is: Watch it without any prior knowledge about it, besides from reviews of course (but be careful with spoilers). This way you will probably enjoy it much more since everything will be new for you. And if there is a highlight in this anime, it's probably its ability to surprise you, in many different and adorable ways.\\n\r\nNumeric score: Story- 7/ Characters- 8/ Artwork- 9/ Sound- 9/ Enjoyment- 7/ Overall- 8\\n\r\n(You do know you can check them by clicking the \"Overall\" hyperlink, right?) \\n\\n\r\n\"Be engulfed by the flames of darkness and begone!\"",

            "content": "There's nothing to see here, just another generic moe anime.\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is another one of KyoAni's generic moe anime that have little to no story, and is just plain moe + humor. They've done this style so many times, that it's getting just annoying watching them repeat the same style for each anime they do. Why are they stuck on the moe train? Do they really only want to appeal to the otakus who watch anime, not for it's story, for the character's \"moeness\"? KyoAni is wasting their talent on these \"moeblobs\", when they could be using their quality animation on biggerand better things.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, story. What story? Chunnibyou doesn't have a story. It's pure moe and humor as I said above. It has some \"action\" scenes, that really couldn't be anymore pointless, because they're not really happening, it's just in their imagination. The humor is funny at times, but really, I think I've smiled maybe two or three times during 10 episodes. It's just not that funny. The characters overexaggerate to anything that it just makes me facepalm it rather then try to force myself to find it amusing. It's not funny. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound are both fine, as expected from KyoAni. Nothing more to say here.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the Characters, this is where I'm really going to rip on this anime. \\n\r\nThe MC, Yuuta Togashi, is as generic as you can possibly think of. His personality is as generic as ever. I can really name over 50 other male MCs who act the same exact way as he does. And I can also name over 50 other male MCs who even resemble him. He's the definition of a generic MC. He's your typical, dumb male main character, who is socially awkward, and a bit of a nerd. Yep, I've never seen this before! Just as any other male MC, he wouldn't know if a girl liked/loved him if she shouted in his ear \"I FUCKING LOVE YOU, YOU IDIOT\". He probably say \"Huh..? What do you mean? You think apples are good?\" A lot of anime today seem to have a fetish to make the male MC as dumb as possible. Why do they do this? I wonder...\\n\\n\r\nThe female MC, Rikka Takanashi, is again, another generic character with no personality what-so-ever. She might as well be a copy of Mei Misaki from \"Another\", except her eye patch is on the opposite eye and she isn't gothic. But their personalities are roughly identical. And when I say that, I mean they don't have personalities. Rikka, just like Mei, is your typical obscure female MC, who's true motives/goals are obscure. Rikka isn't special at all. She's boring and she doesn't do anything funny. When she has her rare serious moments, I really can't take them seriously because I haven't really become attached to her, or seen her act like a real human being. She's like a robot who doesn't know any better and doesn't respond to intelligence. \\n\\n\r\nThe other female characters, such as Shinka, Sanae, Kuzuha, are boring too. Sanae is probably the most interesting out of all of them, and that's not a good thing. Shinka is your sterio-typical cheerleader, who is self-centered and a drama queen. Sanae is there just for the moe and comedy. Kuzuha - I STILL don't know her purpose in this anime. She's the most boring out of all of them. She's often sleeping in random places, which was slightly funny the first 2 or 3 times, but now it's just lame and they keep over-using a gag that wasn't that funny to begin with. This reminds me of Fuko in Clannad, her appearances were annoying and as pointless as you can possibly imagine. Touka, or Rikka 2.0, is as boring and personality-less as Rikka.\\n\\n\r\nI will finish this anime because it is only 12 episodes, but I do NOT recommend it. It's generic. I mean, if generic moe anime is your thing, and you don't give a fuck about character development, plot, then this anime is perfect for you. There are a lot of better anime out there than this one.",

            "content": "I'm autistic. I've come a long way since I was young. Oftentimes autistic people prefer fantasy over reality. When I was in the 4th grade, I got into Yu-Gi-Oh. Unlike most normal kids, I still couldn't distinguish fantasy from reality. I truly believed that characters in cartoons were real people. I fell in love with the little Yugi. No, this wasn't some childish crush. It was basically a hardcore obsession. I raved on and on and on about how I'd marry Yugi and cuddle with him and kiss him and have kids with him and all that dumb stuff. Yeah, stuff like this is normalwith kids in kindergarten or something, always delving into make believe stuff. But I was in the 4th grade then, and I didn't realize back then that cartoons were just drawings on paper made to move with high rez technology. I think my obsession set in motion some bullying I had to endure later on, but I don't remember as I haven't run into anyone who knew me back in the 4th grade. I didn't get out of this phase until the 6th grade. Yeah, personally I'd love to bury those memories under six feet of dirt, as they're so embarrassing to look back on (and I don't think I understood that what I was doing back then was embarrassing). Everybody has embarrassing memories they wish they could bury six feet under dirt. Everybody has a time where they pretended to be something so intensely that they believed they were some fictional character for some reason. Something like this is usually common among little kids or the mentally disabled. But...in this anime, middle/high schoolers, who should CLEARLY know better, bring this up to such extraordinary and ridiculous levels, it's not even funny. Why does this thing exist?!\\n\\n\r\nOkay. Forgive me for sounding rude and blunt, which I don't mean to be, and I'm not trying to look down on fans or people who actually used to pretend to be fantasy characters when they were young. I understand this is fiction, and I'm not trying to sound like I take this a little too personally. However, there is SO MUCH wrong with this anime it's not even funny. I'm surprised other people haven't pointed these things out yet, so I'm going to no matter what people say to me! Let me start off with the single worst thing about this show: the way it portrays these fantasies. Now, it's not uncommon for people to pretend to be anime characters or something like that. Heck, sometimes I like to pretend I'm Dilandau from Escaflowne or Usagi from Sailor Moon. Heck, when me and my friends were young, we would pretend to be Pokemon trainers and play pretend battles back when we had recess in elementary school! Of course, that was mostly because I'm autistic and because we were young kids back then who wanted to have fun instead of deal with boring stuff like school or homework. Plus, we actually knew when to be lost in our fantasies and when we had to deal with reality, even though we didn't want to deal with the latter. But our main character, Yuuta, a perfectly normal and NOT physically or mentally flawed high schooler AT ALL, suddenly decided he was some Dark Flame Master and completely took on this persona. In middle school. And acted like that. IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. EVEN DURING CLASSES. IN PUBLIC!! Do you see what's wrong here? It's one thing to be a little kid and pretend to be anime characters when we're alone, but...a middle schooler?! Acting like that every single day?! In plain view of other kids, teachers, and authority figures?! Seriously, this kid SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER!! So should everyone else, despite having their reasons for deluding themselves in fantasies! Yet what does this anime do?! It tries to give it some fancy name called Eighth Grader Syndrome, or Chuunibyo as they call it. Come on people!! This isn't some phenomenon! It's just stupid kids acting out their fantasies and acting like complete idiots when they SHOULD know better! What also appalls me is the way other people react to them! They just watch looking all weird and let them do their thing! It's probably more of a cultural thing, and I'm in America so Japan probably has a different view on this than Americans, but...seriously, if someone did stuff like this in real life, they'd be bullied relentlessly and be reminded of it for the rest of their lives, possibly to the point of making them commit suicide! I'm surprised the kids who saw Yuuta's Dark Flame Master gig didn't laugh at him or bully him or record videos of it and put it on YouTube so they could ruin his life completely!! I know that if I ever did that stuff in public, it'd most certainly happen to me since I'm not the most popular person in school! We all know what happened to Tyler Clementi here! Seriously, Yuuta should have known better than to do embarrassing stuff like that in public all the time!! Just the way the show portrays all of this as if it's the most normal thing in the world by making light of it and using it for comedy...how can any sane person even approve of such atrocities?!\\n\\n\r\nWell, if there is one thing the show does well, it's the fact that it DOES show characters who DO feel embarrassed by their past selves and flinch whenever they even run into someone they knew from those days, and that's how the show starts. Yuuta, ashamed by how audacious and retarded he acted back in middle school, even by his standards, manages to go to a new school and hopes to start anew...but then he meets some random girl named Rikka who is so lost in fantasy it's not even funny. Even Yuuta agrees with me. But unlike him, Rikka only does it outside of school (smart move!). But her antics drive Yuuta up the wall and he wants nothing to do with her. He tries to get her off his back, but she keeps on coming back no matter what despite actually telling her multiple times to back off and leave him alone. However, Rikka makes him join her \"society\", along with a bunch of other people including a personal friend of hers, and form some stupid and pointless club whose name is so stupid I can't even remember it. Only two of said members are lost in their fantasies, Rikka and her friend, while Yuuta and three others, Shinka, Kumin, and Isshiki, just go along with their antics without really caring much except for Yuuta and Shinka. But soon, Yuuta starts to discover the real reason behind Rikka's yearning to be lost in her fantasies, especially when her older sister, Touka, also refuses to get off his back.\\n\\n\r\nLet me get the other ridiculously bad part out of the way: the characters. Other than Yuuta, Shinka, and later Rikka, all of the characters, even some of the adults who aren't directly involved with Rikka's life, act like such retards it's not even funny! I especially couldn't stand Rikka's ridiculously pig-tailed friend Dekomori and her constant emphasis on \"DESu! DESu! DESu!\" all the time! Every time she said a word I seriously wanted to duct tape her mouth shut! Isshiki's nothing but a girl chasing cheapskate (though admittedly he DOES actually decide to go after one single girl later), and Kumin...oh God. She has to be the single most stupid and annoyingly bland character in the ENTIRE cast. Why? All she likes to do is sleep and act forcedly cute with her squeaky voice! That's it! And even in the end she acts stupid but for a different reason entirely! The only characters in this show who actually have their brains even remotely in tact are Yuuta, Shinka, and members of Rikka's family, and the former two only act normal AFTER they get over their silly fantasies! I actually applaud Yuuta for being strong-minded and saying what's on his mind, not being totally bland and indecisive even though he gets dragged into stupid stuff against his will. At least he MAKES IT CLEAR that he hates what he's being dragged into. Yeah, he's loud, brash, selfish, insensitive and does treat Rikka badly in the beginning, but in this case, I'd find it rather justified, as no normal person acts the way she (or he did when he was young) does in real life! I hated every interaction between them, especially the time where Yuuta shaves Isshiki's head with very pointless and melodramatic screaming and crying, and when Shinka and Dekomori fought like cats and dogs. Now, one reviewer I read about was disappointed by Touka blackmailing/threatening Yuuta into helping her fix her problems with her sister instead of doing it herself. I don't think this is the case. Maybe she DID try to help Rikka out offscreen but her attempts didn't work no matter what, so she decided to go the extra mile. That's how I think of it. But that's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nIt may be KyoAni and all, but I'm going to be upfront: their animation here looks really sloppy. Tamako Market looked better than this. The music is rather bland, the theme songs were annoying, and the insert songs were used in the wrong places. Ugh. Now, the only reason I watched this show was because of one reviewer's interpretation of it, and how the final episode shows a strong moral about being true to yourself, embracing the weirdness within, and not being happy with conforming because other people say so. Now, these are themes that I love to see explored in anime. Heck, right now, I'm in a situation where I do do things people think as strange, but I do them in moderation and I do them to be happy, not to cause anyone trouble. Why else would we watch anime and read books and play video games than to take a break from the tiresome world around us? We want to have fun, and in a way, I understand why the characters in here do the things they do. My sister and I don't really see eye to eye since we have very different views on the world and we clash a lot. I'm convinced that because of my disability, she believes I'm someone who will throw a tantrum if I even remotely do anything she deems rude and inappropriate, like accidentally say the wrong thing, and who she has to watch over every single second like I'm that kid from the movie Problem Child (y'know, the one with Gilbert Gottfried). I may have a disability, but I KNOW what to do when I'm out in public. I know how to be polite and say thank you and be appreciative and when to do something and when not to. I know all of this, yet she seems to believe that I don't and constantly reminds me of how stupid I am and seems to believe that anything I say or do, well intentioned or not, is always rude or out of malice. I don't show her the anime I watch because I'm convince she'll question my motives for watching them and completely get the wrong ideas about said shows, and I LOATHE being misunderstood more than anything. I bring this thing with my sister up because later in the show, Rikka and Touka get into a similar situation which I think IS rather understandable, and even justifiable to a degree, but I won't go further for the sake of spoilers. Sure, we all love a little fun and games once in a while, especially if it's to unwind after a hard day at work or find happiness after a really bad day. I used to be bullied in school, yet anime and manga have saved me from doing stuff like doing drugs and cutting myself. I don't mind pretending I'm in my safe little fantasy world and being lost in it for a short while when I'm alone, and I know when to keep it in moderation. But...if it's taken to this extent, then it's just plain annoying and insulting.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm NOT trying to start any backlash or flame wars or anything. I'm not trying to bash the disabled or the mentally ill or anyone like that. I'm not even trying to imply that the characters in the show are disabled or mentally not right in the head. Why would I do that when I myself have a disability? That's the last thing I'd ever do, and I'm not that kind of person, especially since I explained why I don't like this show, and I'm not trying to make it sound like I still can't distinguish fantasy from reality. I know better than that, even though I do let my emotions get the better of me sometimes, not that I mean to. We all have our strange sides here and there, and we should do what makes us happy, even though society claims it's not normal and that we should act the way they want us to act, which is basically to obey everything they say, even though it feels more like they want to put us in a box because we're flawed. So what if we want to burst out and be ourselves? That's what people should do! Be themselves! Don't hold back! Do whatever makes you happy, and don't be what others want you to be just so they can feel good about themselves. Don't be poisoned by the selfish wishes of others. I love being myself. We should embrace our weirdness and enjoy it, no matter how hard people try to drag us down. But this anime approaches it in such an insulting manner it's not even funny. I KNOW for a fact that if I wanted to write a story about an anime about being true to yourself if it makes you happy despite the opinions of others, I'd be able to execute it better than this! It's one thing to actually have people who pretend and play act for fun, and then there's having people do it ALL THE FREAKING TIME AND IN PUBLIC IN FRONT OF OTHERS, and the latter is just plain wrong on so many ridiculous levels.\\n\\n\r\nThis is fine for entertainment, but if you really want an anime about being true to yourself, stay far away from this. This has ridiculous written all over it. Sorry if I sounded too personal. Just throwing my opinion out there. That's all.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: It seems I've caused some confusion in regards to the message my review has been giving out. It seems people have mis-interpreted my review as hating the show for not being realistic even though it's just a cartoon. I GET that it's a cartoon and I DO NOT hate the show for not being realistic. Did anyone even read my review word for word? I don't judge shows for realism. That's not why cartoons exist. Heck, if you look at my top 3 shows, they're anything but realistic! I despise Chuunibyou simply because I hate the insulting and downright comically insensitive way it portrays kids having vivid imaginations and taking them to a ridiculous extreme, even going as far as not having people laugh or shake their heads in contempt. Is that really so hard to understand?",

            "content": "\"Another romance / comedy anime? And another eyepatch girl? Please spare us... \"\r\nI beg to differ.\r\nHello fellow anime fans, my name is Gillis. This is my very first anime review and I mainly decided to write it as this anime seems to have been overlooked by many, and I at least want it to catch your attention. Heck, another eyepatch girl, some may think when they see the picture of the anime. I am like that too, but if you miss this series I won't forgive you.\r\nI have been watching anime for a long time, all the way back in grade school. When I startedthere was already a lot of great classics to watch, and I was the self-proclaimed local Anime-guru back in the days. In the recent past two years though I've watched many new and old series, never finding anything I have liked (there are some rare, few exceptions). Usually I just pick up a new anime when I am about to eat and then I drop it after maybe 2 episodes. In fact, I have actually dropped over 100 series (yes more than my list) and the biggest reason is that: Either it does not hook me from the start, or it just got no story. My taste is all-round, it can be anything... as long as the plot is good, not necessarily unique. The art does not have to be excellent either. For me, as said, it's all about the quality of the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, enough of my background. About 1 week ago, as I was about to sit down and eat I was lurking around on a anime stream website and picked up a random anime I had not seen. \"Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!\". As usual I did not expect much. I just wanted to watch something random while eating my food. Heck, the only recent masterpiece I had seen most recently was Steins; Gate... and that was quite some time ago. However, as I started watching Chuunibyou I was in for a surprise. The introduction of the anime presents the interesting disease called \"8th-grader symptom\" or in japanese \"Chuunibyou\". To summarize, it is the difficult age we've been going through as teenagers where we do some really silly things that we all want to forget. As the explanation of this disease continues we are introduced to one of the main characters of the story, Togashi Yuuta, which was practically a textbook example of the Chuunibyou disease when he was younger, calling himself \"Dark Flame Master\" or in japanese \"Darku Flameu Masta\". Jokes aside, the start really piqued my interest in an instant. I want you to notice that I am very skeptical as I watch new animes. That is, until I am completely seduced by it. \\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nThe First Episode - *WARNING - SPOILERS* (Skip this section if you want)\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nNow, the episode continues with Yuuta, having a flashback of his embarrassing past and we come to realize that his Chuunibyou state is over in the present. As he goes to dispose of his past at the balcony a rope is suddenly thrown down from the floor above and down climbs an eyepatch girl named Takanashi Rikka, the other main character of the story. Immediately, as skeptical as I am, I facepalmed right away as the scene was shown to me. \"By default\" I muttered dissatisfied, recalling about 10 other animes that had started in a similar way. Anyhow, my interest and attention had already been caught by the presentation, so I continued to watch. \\n\\n\r\nRikka appeared as a really weird girl, wearing an eyepatch and some gothic clothes. Of course, weird and strange overall by climbing down from the third floor on a rope. Certainly not very original though. After this short event the opening starts and afterwards we appear on the next day as Yuuta is about to make his debut into high school and on his way, at the train station, stumble into one of the other main characters. A cute girl named Nibutani Shinka but most importantly into Rikka as well. Yuuta recalls the event that occurred the day before and realizes that she goes to the same school as he does. Of course at that moment, my skeptical sensors turns alert mode: \"Oh no, another harem romance show\". However, my negative impression was short-lived as in that moment the train arrives and Rikka opens the automatic doors with a large swing by her arm, displaying her mental powers. With a complacent grin on her face she walks into the the train in a really cute and childish manner. Yuuta, being shocked by the moment, manages to miss his train. By this little event I was already starting to be charmed by the series.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, Yuuta barely arrives in time after having missed his train. As he take a peek into his class he sees that he knows no one in there. Perfect, just as planned! Apparently Yuuta had chosen a different high school that his middle school classmates would not choose. Obviously so that he can get rid of his past filled by his miserable time as a hopeless Chuunibyo case and start a new, normal high school life. But before he enters the class he first walks to a remote area, where he speaks his catchphrase back when he was the Dark Flame Master and \"seals\" it. Though he thought he was alone, a girl could hear him. Which is with no doubt Rikka. \\n\\n\r\nBack in class he sits down and almost immediately gets on good terms with guy named Isshiki Makoto and soon realizes that the beauty from the train station, Nibutani, also is in the same class as him. What a blessing for his new high school life... only to shortly after find out that Rikka is in the same class as well. As if that was not enough, she suddenly creates a dramatic and embarrassing scene as she stands in front of Yuuta, grasping her eye under the eyepatch as she screams out in pain, saying something about her eye resonating. Under this sudden scene Yuuta realizes all too well what is wrong with her. It can only be a grave and serious case of Chuunibyo. On top of it, he is practically forced to take her to the infirmary where he once again confirms that she really is a dangerous case of Chuunibyo. Whats more, Rikka tells Yuuta that she had found out about his identity, namely \"Dark Flame Master\". Now Rikka was a presence which could threaten his new dear high school life. Correctly so, later at the day he is invited by Makoto to hang out and eat lunch with some classmates. Oh the joy! What a great start to his new high school life... but the opportunity quickly vanishes as the teacher calls Yuuta in, asking him to help Rikka home as she has lost her train card. If you recall, she lives at the same building as Yuuta. Depressed, Yuuta does as told and declines the lunch invitation. And from this moment on the episode is more or less Yuuta and Rikka interacting and getting to know each other. And I must say it is more interesting, cute and funny than you would imagine.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\n*END OF SPOILERS*\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\r\nQuality, Plot & Characters\\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\r\nThat pretty much sets the comical and romantic aspect for the series. Being Yuuta having to take care of this impossible case of Chuunibyo, namely Rikka. And shortly after 2-3 episodes I was already in love with the series. As far as the first episodes progress we mainly get to know the main characters better, and it is actually more comedy than there is romance. There is not too much to the story neither at first, as we mostly get to know more background of the main characters. Though if that is something which would keep you bored, fear not. The comedy is really decent and as you probably have discovered, the Chuunibyo disease (8th grader symptom) is already an original part in this anime which separates it from the mass. It is an ingenious idea and the author exploits it really well to create some great comedy which made me laugh out loud a lot. It is an idea that would not run out of quality even if this anime had been made into 24 episodes or more... which in fact, makes me very angry that it isn't. Also, if it is your preference, I can tell you that the animation is really great too. And the soundtrack makes up a lot of the series. But of course, this is not all there is to Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!. Remember, I am all about the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a few episodes of getting used to the main characters, the anime switch much more focus unto Yuuta and especially Rikka. I must really say I love these two characters. Yuuta is the kind of person trying to fit in with the rest, trying to be normal and fit with the group. Though, he just cannot abandon Rikka even though she is embarrassing and acts wrong, which is the biggest reason I like Yuuta as a character. Of course, he plays a huge role in the comedy factor as he is the only reasonable person among Rikka and her Chuunibyo followers. Rikka too is the comical aspect of the series, trying to draw Yuuta in with her wild fantasies. At the same time she is also very cute, kind and a bit mystic. Though there is more reason to her Chuunibyo state than just age...\\n\\n\r\nAs said, shortly after some episodes of getting to know the characters we get to the main story line which contains a lot of romance, but also a lot of drama. Yes, drama. How I love drama. Of course it is necessary to like the characters to create good drama. You could say the first episodes are preparation for it. We get to know Rikka's background a lot better as Yuuta finds out more about her. Her background contains a lot of drama and Yuuta tries his best to understand Rikka and help her in any way he can. Although he does a lot of mistakes and it is truly touching seeing how both the main characters grow together, understanding their faults, understanding what they feel and what the other feels. Too much of this would be spoilers, but it takes a truly dramatic turn and at the end of the anime I was deeply touched. What a great show! I had never expected it when I started watching the anime two days ago. Actually I was so caught up into it that I watched it all in one night, having to face the consequences on the next day. But it was just that good. I am considering if it was worth it though, since afterwards I have been feeling really depressed. Perhaps because I watched such great series all in one night and now there is no more episodes for me to see. Or maybe I am just saddened by my miserable life compared to how they live in the series. Why can't I have such a wonderful occurrence? Or maybe I fell in love with Rikka. Which of these it is, I do not know. But what I do know is that this anime became one of my top favorites and has refreshed my mind. It is truly a masterpiece for its genre, and I highly, dearly... more than recommend it.\\n\\n\r\n~~~~\\n\r\nScore\\n\r\n~~~~\\n\\n\r\nI do not know who the fansubers for the series are. Still trying to find out who my favorite fansubers for this anime is. I do know though that Unlimited Translation Works (UTW or URW for short) subtitles are okay but I do not recommend them.\\n\\n\r\nPlot - 9/10\\n\r\nComedy - 9/10\\n\r\nRomance - 6/10\\n\r\nDrama - 7/10\\n\r\nStory - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound, Music & Voice - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nPace - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10",

            "content": "(Minor Spoilers)\r\nAs I watched the first episode of Chuunibyou, I remember saying to myself \"great...another Haruhi Suzumiya clone\" and while there are distinct similarities between the two animes, I'm thrilled that I kept watching and gave Chuunibyou the chance it deserved.\r\nThere isnt much of a story or plot for much of the show, episodes usually introduce new characters or develop existing ones by way of crazy slice of life situations. That is untill the second half of the series, when much of the shows stellar humor is traded for an impressive romance, and all star character development. While I found myself missing the side splittinghumor that got me hooked in the first place, I couldn't complain because of the touching, and impressive story that was woven in the later half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for most of the show is above average, but in several situations the creators must have milked the budget to create some truely epic scenes I never wouldve expected from a slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound was also above average, no glaring issues or complaints to speak of\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, I groaned when I caught my first glances of the characters in Chuunbyou. At first glance the female lead seems like a shamless Haruhi clone, and the male lead a bland John Doe. Side characters were familiar archtypes, the airhead, the popular girl, etc. While nearly all the characters were hilarious, none were particularly original or different. At first. As the show progresses Rikka, the female lead begins to distinguish herself as a relatively unique character, and as the story progresses even further shes fleshed out as a complete human being in an extemely touching and effective way. While the male lead isnt fleshed out quite as much, he quickly develops some unique characteristics, and his relationships develop at a believable and satisfying pace. Side characters remain, well, side characters, with some, but not much developments. Overall the relationships and personalities really shine in the second half of the show, which is where they earn their 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment of the show was a perfect 10. This may well be the funniest anime I've seen since Gintama. The countless anime refrences include parodies of yu yu hakusho, code geass, death note, and countless more I missed or cant recall. The character interactions and truely unique situations that arise are simply hilarious, but where the shows humor really shines is its shameless exaggeration of everyday events. In the mind of the female lead even sneaking out and being caught by her sister becomes an epic battle of good and evil, and everything from unlocking a door to getting on a train ends up as a hilarious, over-the-top joke, reference, or parody. In short, the shows humor is all-star, oscar worthy, and downright side splitting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, thanks to a hilarious, if at times cliche cast, touching romance, character development, and over the top hilarious humor, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! earns a solid 9/10 as well as my eager reccomendation.",

People withchuunibyou either act like a know-it-all adult and look down on real ones, or believe they have special powers unlike others.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a common stage in growth; for most people, it happens--you guessed it--around the 2nd year of middle school (Grade 8 in Japan). However, the problem is, there are some grown-ups who have this symptom.\"\\n\\n\r\nJust looking up this meaning made me grin like from ear to ear you know why?\\n\r\nBecause it was something that most of us have experienced in our school lives, whether it be in a severe form of mimicking your favorite TV character or in a cooler form of trying to be a wannabe music artist and developing newer ways to look good like your idol. In any case when we remember this some of us just smile and think \"that was fun\" and some of us think \"i wish i had never done that, i just want to roll over and die\".\\n\\n\r\nNow coming to the anime what does the above written extra info have to do with the anime?? EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nThe entire series is about a boy named Yuuta Togashi who has overcome his chuunibyou and Rika Takanashi who is still going through it somehow. The two meet each other on the night before their 1st day of highschool only to meet in the same classroom. Rika contacts Yuuta and calls him Dark Flame Master (Yuuta's former alter ego) and tells him that she has a wicked eye which is responding to his dark aura and she wants to form a contract with him, this makes Yuuta embarassed but somehow the two become friends a nd are drwan to each other.\\n\\n\r\nWell that was the gist of the story of the anime but now we come to the main point that why should you watch this anime??\\n\\n\r\nwell its simple............. Its amazing!\\n\\n\r\nWhen one looks at Yuuta's character he/she is reminded of their own phase of childhood imagination. The plot turns really do remind you of the points and realizations that made you stop with your imagination. \\n\r\nThis anime will get you in the heart, it will make you laugh, will make you emotional and remember your own childhood and bring back memories that seem like a distant dream, and make you wish you could be a child again.\\n\\n\r\nWATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!",

            "content": "My first response to Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! was an eye-roll. I predicted the plot in my head, guy tries to forget past, meets girl, remembers past. Falls in love. Yawn. Let's move on right?\r\nWell perhaps my first impression wasn't too far off the bat. \r\nCertainly, the first episodes of Chuu2-Byo presented itself in a very unique fashion, it's rich humor and fantastic character chemistry made me want to punch past me for thinking something so horrid about this show.\r\nWe are first introduced to Yuuta Togashi, a chuunibyou victim and survivor, we see him frantically try to get rid of any evidence that hispast ever existed. Dark Flame Master who? He even goes so far as to pick a High School that none of his old classmates will go to because frankly, it's just that embarrassing. We can all relate right? Everybody has done something so embarrassing that it haunts and terrorizes us to this very day.\\n\r\nIf I'm honest, there was no reason to dislike Yuuta.. his thoughts are animated hilariously and most of his conversations flow fairly well, the anime did a very good job in making us actually feel sorry for him that every time he gets a blast of his past I have to pause and squirm WITH him.\\n\r\nSo when Yuuta finally throws out the boxes and thinks he's off to live a normal life, someone far from normal appears in the apartment above.\\n\r\nTakanashi Rikka - a girl under deep deep case of Chuunibyou (or Eighth-Grade Syndrome), literally a representation of everything Yuuta wants to throw out, crosses paths with our protagonist to the point they are even in the same club.\\n\r\nUnconsciously or not, Yuuta cannot get rid of her and takes a special interest even though he claims he wants nothing to do with her. The audience is then introduced to their amusing interactions on a day to day basis.\\n\r\nTheir relationship is nothing short but cute, the two characters ooze dynamics in most scenes with their playful bickering and their almost automatic responses to each other like some sort of reflex. Their very subtle hints of affections and sincere feelings for each other never grows old... or does it?\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the last 6 episodes fail to completely tie everything in... Chuu2-Byo gets.. well.. to be point-blank - tiring. All of the characters, Dekomori, Isshiki, Nibutani and even Kumin brought a special flare to the screen that made most episodes entertaining.\\n\r\nBut some of these antics just get too repetitive. Okay, we get it, you sleep a lot.. and so...?\\n\\n\r\nThen, out of thin air, things go for a(n over) dramatic turn, its progress, climax and 'ending' falls flat and in return, results into something very underwhelming. Due to the lack of material the audience is given, it provides us with a weak impact. Leaving you with a.. \"Huh? That's it?\"\\n\r\nThings get too exaggerated that it almost made me dumbfounded - how in the hell did we get to here? It wasn't even some sort of plot-twist or shocker, it was almost as if a bunch of writers had different ideas and routes and decided to just do all of them. Such out of character and sudden nonsense appeared out of nowhere, like desperate efforts to make this show somehow substantial. But its conclusion is this: disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nWe see a different side to Rikka that yes, allows us to empathise with her.\\n\r\nReality is a bitter truth and life in general, is hard to cope with when you have to accept things that would be a lot easier if it never happened. So you force yourself to create your own bubble, your own safety net because you just don't want to get hurt. You don't want to get sad. That is how Rikka chooses to survive - chuunibyou. What comes off as a childish dream is actually a desperate cry for help.\\n\r\nIf only the show had developed that idea deeper it would have actually gotten somewhere.\\n\r\nInstead we get the girl who sleeps a lot to basically SPELL things out for our beloved, Yuuta. And I have to question, what was the point of Sanae except to be some moe to join the chuunibyou club? I'm sure KyoAni hoped her resolution to influence our feelings somewhat but instead, came across as if it was an April Fools Prank this whole time.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not impossible to develop a light-hearted, teenage love story into something possibly a bit more dramatic, a bit more emotional. \\n\r\nBut not like this. Not receiving-a-letter-from-yourself-2-years-ago way. The clich\u00e9d and unoriginal plot add-ons were not necessary. I'm sure it tried to be more heart-wrenching to make the show a bit more memorable, it's not wrong for them to try something different than the main focus of the show, but they shot the arrow too fast, too far and honestly - how do you expect your audience to be moved by pointless crying by a pointless character?\\n\\n\r\nIf I really had to complain about one tiny thing it would be the fact the anime did no justice to a perfectly good character. Nibutani seemed to be one of the few in this anime who reflected an actual human being with some sort of substance and was how the story even managed to progress in the first place, but was wasted for a very lackluster ending.\\n\\n\r\nIt seemed to me, the anime tried to be profound and meaningful, but it lacked the means - the shoe just did not fit. Rather than coming across as having a new mature perceptive on reality, all it did was bring the characters to square one and if possible, made the whole notion even more immature and naive than it already was. By the end of it, all I could think of was - God, get a grip.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my criticism, it isn't a terrible show by any standard. In fact, it IS enjoyable. It IS appealing. The humor was tasteful, the romance was charming. But even though the first few episodes weren't ground-breaking, it still deserved much more than to be given such an unsatisfactory ending.",

            "content": "I am the Dark Flame Master\r\n PERISH!\r\nBe enveloped by the flames of darkness.\r\n.........just kidding. Ok so I've finish this 12 episode anime, so how do I find it? Well, generally speaking it's good and it's probably one of the best winter animes of 2012 that Kyoani did, frankly, I really don't care as who did who, co'z as longas I like the anime I watch it. So far though this anime's genre are: School, Romance and comedy, everything revolves around that \"Don Quixote Dela Mancha\" theme, besides the a \"Chuunibyou\" can almost be classified as one and just like the mention novel, the character DonQuixote regained his sanity in the end, btw I haven't read the said novel, I only know just a few tidbits of it. Except here, Rikka and Sanae gain their sense of being realistic in the world they live....only to go back to lala land. So for the story, I'm giving it a \"Good\" 7, though the story is touching, the problem is that it attracts us to it at one point and shoves us away in another. There is also that inconsistency as to how Rikka's 8th grade delusional disorder came to be, in one point we were made to assume that she has that disorder all along and that her finding Yuuta was just coincidence, as we make it mid-way, we were introduce to Rikka's father in which his dead was the cause of her disorder, Then it took a U-turn in the final episode when it was Yuuta who indirectly gave her the idea to create a world of her own and be a wielder of her so-called \" Ja\u014d Shingan,\" so with it a score 7 is what this part deserve. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just not an art critic and besides, there isn't any fanservice to speak of, as for the goth loli attire that both Rikka and Sanae dons..... I don't have much to comment about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Character: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nSince, I do like the VA's who portrayed the character's in this anime, I like both the opening and the closing themes. But as for Makoto's VA,  S\u014dichir\u014d Hoshi, I just don't think that he should have done the character's voice co'z his voice no longer has that youthful appeal, if it where me I would have chosen Satoshi Hino. The characters, really did play well, so who are they?\\n\\n\r\nRikka Takanashi: As I've mention, her character as to how she got to know Yuuta was inconsistent and I need not mention it again, I like the way that she portrays this girls whom you'll love to do what Sanzo of \"Saiyuki\" does to Goku when he's pissed and that is hitting him hard on the head with a big paper fan. The funny thing about her is how she keeps sticking on to Yuuta and pesters him about his past as the \"Dark Flame Master,\" but what's entertaining is that Yuuta gets to do what we audience  would want to do to her. JUDGMENT LUCIFER!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nYuuta Tongashi: As the main protagonist and an ex-chuunibyou , he does fulfill that usual high school dude who's world turns upside down when pesky girl comes to his life kind of thing. Ok, so he's the kind of guy in which we the audience would do to Rikka what we wanna do, and that's to knock her back into reality. Thought it would be funnier if he does it often. I do like the part that in the end he was able to help Rikka with her undying grief over her father's dead by accepting her disorder and using it as a way to accept that her life must go on as her master. Besides this anime's title is \" Despite My Adolescent Delusions of Grandeur, I Want a Date!\"\\n\\n\r\nNibutani Shinka: another ex-chuunibyou, ok at one point I did like her to be Yuuta's love interest, but that all came down when I saw how dominant she is and how she looks down on guys. However it is a mystery if she's the one who gave Makoto that love letter or was it Kumin, I guess we'll never know. I'd like the part where she quarrels with Sanae and how she takes charge of things in Rikka's club in a realistic way, since Rikka tends to be very lousy with the club management.  \\n\\n\r\nTsuyuri Kumin: she doesn't have Rikka and Sanae's disorder, but I kinda view her as an add-on to the anime, if she the one who gave Makoto that love letter then she and him would have made a nice pair. I really hate the part where she becomes this welder of Rikka's so called \"Ja\u014d Shingan\" co'z it kinda don't fit her to have such disorder when she's the gang's senior.\\n\\n\r\n Isshiki Makoto: I'd probably describe him as this anime's class clown, especially the part when he has to shave his head co'z he misplaces his survey book and was picked up by Nibutani.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTakanashi Touka: if this anime has a tsundere then she is it, in fact I like the way she woops Rikka's ass (figure of speech). But I really  find her as an unlikable character, due to the fact that she herself has to relied on Yuuta to put Rikka back to reality, Then again her kicking Rikka's ass into reality is the most entertaining part for her. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSanae Dekomori:\"Death,\" I kinda hate her character very much, des. But I do like the way she wore her hair down when she came back into the world of reality, des. Also, des, I like the way she quarrels with Nibutani, des.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nSo maybe this anime attracts us audience towards this anime at one point and shoves us on another, there may some inconsistencies  in it and the idea that this anime's genres  revolves the Don Quixote theme thing. Overall this anime is worth watching, co'z at the end you'll be touched by Rikka and Yuuta being together and going to where the sun rises thingy. The amount of drama may not be much, but it did added such impact to this anime's soft side. Though I'd wish that Kyoani have added \"Satone Shichimiya\" to spiced up this anime a bit more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "At first glance, Chuunibyou is not what it seems, a schoolgirl wearing an eyepatch, the magic circle on the cover and a synopsis that talks about contracts? It would definitely strike you as a fantasy, moe magical-girl anime, but believe me, Chuunibyou is as real is it gets. \r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! was an pretty enjoyable anime.  It made you laugh when you were suppose to laugh, cry when you were suppose to cry as well as melt into the cuteness in an instant.  \"Chuunibyou\" otherwise known as \"Eighth Grade Syndrome\" plays a huge role in this delightful tale of a groupof schoolmates learning to accept themselves as well as the past that they've tried desperately to leave behind.  \\n\\n\r\nThe concept behind the story was very well planned, Rikka is a current high school student who is now suffering from Eighth Grade Syndrome, she approaches Yuuta, a boy who has deliberately tried to erase his past when he also had the syndrome.  At first Yuuta expresses immediate reluctance towards Rikka because he is constantly reminded of his past self and he assumes Rikka is being childish and silly, but as the anime progresses, he begins to warm up to her and her antics, and slowly begins to realize that there may be something beyond the adventure that has Rikka hiding behind her eye-patch. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, as expected from Kyoto Animations was gorgeous but the cuteness might not be everyone's cup of tea. The graphics and animation is very fluid and a pleasure to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nI have no complaints about the sound at all, the voices were clear and not annoying, BGM wasn't overly distracting and went nicely with the events that occurred.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were very believable and while the stunts they carried out were a bit outrages at some points, the reasoning behind them were understandable.\\n\\n\r\nAs a slice-of-life, I think this anime did a brilliant job keeping you interested, with a heartwarming story paired with comedy bound to make you dissolve into giggles.\\n\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is a story that will break your heart but fill it with absolute adoration for the characters at the same time.   \\n\\n\r\nI greatly enjoyed this anime and while I wish they characters and relationships were elaborated a bit more, it didn't hurt the anime's presentation or content much.\\n",

            "content": "Imagination is not in any way a new or unusual route for a way to escapism. Even if just so momentarily, it can easily lighten the burden of gravity\u2019s melancholy. It\u2019s one of many ways to escape reality. It\u2019s not a case of an incapability to differentiate reality from imagination, it\u2019s simply a temporary get a way.\r\nHowever, at first glance this doesn\u2019t seem to be the case of Takanashi Rikka. It really seems like the difference between reality and fiction is beyond her horizon of apprehension. This soul seems to be completely lost in her own imaginary world. What makes it even more worrisome isthat she should long ago have grown from this phase, since she at the moment is in her teenage years. This state which she at the moment is situated in is called \u201cChuunibyou\u201d in Japanese, roughly translated into \u201cEight-Grade Syndrome\u201d, therefore the name of the series.\\n\\n\r\nHer distorted world only seems to become even more delusional when she meets with a boy named Togashi Yuuta, who before also was lost in an illusionary world. Rikka who secretly found out about his past case of chuunibyou is herself in a state of joy. Even though Yuuta is determined to never again put up with the act of embarrassment which once was his daily routine, he and Rikka still manage to become close friends. The comical friendship between the delusional girl and the emphatic boy later progresses into a unconventional relationship, which can be described as unadulterated as well as heart-warming.\\n\\n\r\nEven though the Plot isn't complex or the characters truly intriguing. The show still manages to become enjoyable through its mixture of humour and cuteness. Even though you could argue that the story about Rikka and Yuuka tells a moral about the vague concept of maturity, I doubt that\u2019s what the show mainly accomplishes. At least for me it\u2019s more about a unique tale, than sending an important message. A story which can be comforting in the same way as a rich imagination. A show that ultimately speaks more through emotion, than through intellect. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Kyoto Animation has this strange habit of making programmes I can relate to and yet have major problems with in spite of that empathy factor. As an example of this phenomenon of theirs, let's take a look at Love, Chunibyo, & Other Delusions: a programme that's about your Narutard phase from middle school, or more specifically, one person who recently got out of that phase and his relationship with another person who's still wearing a forehead protector and making hand signs.\r\nI'm just gonna rip this bandage right off from the start so that yall know what I think of the show: I actually do happento like this show and rather enjoyed watching it. As far as the subject matter is concerned, it definitely got that strange mix of embarrassment and nostalgia that comes with the territory of being an ex-Narutard down perfectly. On that note, the relationship between Yuuta and Rikka was rather sweet in that \"this can't possibly happen in real life, but my god is it so sickeningly adorable\" way. Of course with that in mind, I feel like I should let yall know that I also happen to have my grievances with the series. It's not like all this vitriol built up toward the series was just hype backlash, after all.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters (and this is a personal gripe, mind you), I feel like the aesthetics truly get in the way conveying the concept of \"chunibyo\" (aka that middle school Narutard phase). I'm not just talking about Kyoto Animation's trademark usage of moe either, I'm also talking about Kyoto Animation lavishly animating those imaginary battles that Rikka, Yuuta, et al have as well. This show's supposed to be about the embarrassment and shame that comes with chunibyo, and yet the depiction that Kyoto Animation goes for basically glorifies it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I love the idea of Kyoto Animation animating the imaginary battles so that it shows what it looks like to Rikka, Dekomori, et al, but they spent far too much time animating something that wasn't actually happening. They really should've spent more time showing how stupid that they were looking by fighting with their imaginary powers. I mean, there are some instances where they flash back and forth between the imaginary fight and reality, but those scenes were few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, Kyoto Animation's whole moe shtick is fine and all but in the case of this show, it really gets in the way of depicting the shame and embarrassment of chunibyo. Whenever I saw Dekomori or Rikka or whoever else doing their chunibyo shtick, I wasn't thinking \"my god, they look stupid,\" i was thinking \"aw, how adorable.\" I suppose on the one hand, it makes the subject matter easier to handle than it would've been otherwise had the series used an art style similar to Naoki Urasawa's or Inio Asano's, but at the same time, there's this part of me that expected this show to hit me square in the gut with that \"oh god, I was that loser and I still am that loser\" feeling just like Oyasumi Punpun and Welcome to the NHK did and the moe just doesn't lend itself to that kind of approach.\\n\\n\r\nNow, going away from the aesthetics, there is one thing that just got under my skin and that would have to be the second half of the show. Had this series just been a quirky romantic comedy about a topic we can all relate to throughout all of its episodes, I wouldn't have had any problems with the series as a whole. Unfortunately, it just had to devolve into a melodrama by the final six episodes and this final half of the series is what brought about the rest of the problems I have with the series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThis half of the show tries to explore Rikka's reasoning for still clinging to her chunibyo phase and as fate would have it, her chunibyo is a coping mechanism. Now, I could DEFINITELY relate to the coping mechanism thing as escapism is a very real and rather unhealthy method of coping with personal problems. Of course, this is where my problems with the show really kick into full gear. If Rikka was using chunibyo as a means to cope with her own personal problems, then why wasn't this show told from Rikka's perspective with a more sombre tone from the very beginning?\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I like Yuuta, I could think of several other characters that are virtually identical to him in terms of appearance and personality (i.e. Yuichi from Kanon, Tomoya from Clannad, Kyon from Haruhi; funnily enough, they're all from other KyoAni shows). Whilst I could certainly empathise with Yuuta, I feel like Rikka would've made for a more compelling character had the series cut the comedy out of the equation and then focused entirely on Rikka and her own personal struggles. Then again, that would imply that the series even remotely shows Rikka struggling with anything because this \"revelation\" as it were comes out of nowhere and is poorly explained.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the entire programme was another one of those undeserved happy endings that I've come to despise, but in Chu2's case, I feel like it was done better than most other shows do it. The series ends on a note that basically says \"no matter how old you get, you'll always be embarrassed by some stupid shit you did in the past but you should always move forward in spite of that,\" which is a sentiment I can definitely get behind. I mean, that doesn't really change the fact that I feel like the ending was undeserved but at least it has something going for it that lets me partially get past it.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound were absolutely gorgeous, although the ED theme grated on my ears. There was one track in particular that I really liked called \"Surechigao Kokoro to Kokoro\" (Hearts and Minds Crossing Each Other). It's a simple piano/violin piece that really just gets at your heartstrings. Of course, this track would've worked out so much better if the show was a romantic drama that had some inkling of tact rather than a romantic comedy turned melodrama. But hey, it manages to get me to partially ignore my gripes and cheer on for Yuuta and Rikka to have that heartfelt reunion with one another and then make out under the stars... even though that shit NEVER happens >_>\\n\\n\r\nWhen people tell me that they cried whilst watching this show, I just wonder how they were even able to do that. I mean, I've honestly teared up at some of the stuff I've read/watched but Chu2 is a far cry from Fruits Basket or Oyasumi Punpun. At the same time, it was nice having a show that actually manages to get the sheer level of frustration and embarrassment of being an ex-Narutard down perfectly, even if the aesthetics got in the way of the execution. With that in mind though, I still long for the day that another series will come by and get right what Chu2 got wrong. Anyway, that's all for now. Feedback's always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace =]\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nOne other thing that disappointed me about Chu2: the fact that there wasn't a jab made toward Another throughout the entire show.",

            "content": "Love it!  Love it!  Love it!\r\nHere is a riotously funny story that seems to come out of the blue.  It's refreshingly self-mocking, mocking all of those adolescent fantasies about superpowers and good-vs-evil struggles (as in Fate Stay/Night) by not taking them too seriously, just reducing them all to mere childish otaku.\r\nDespite their fantastic pretensions the characters are all very realistic, their relationships make sense and their motivations engender sympathy and affection.  There isn't one here whom you won't like and who won't make you laugh.  (Even the homeroom teacher is very cute.)\r\nThe humour is somewhere between poignant irony and over-the-tophysterics.  The figures are all well drawn, with no oversized breasts and no pointless panty shots-- in fact the story, though some have classed it as a harem comedy, may be a little short on 'fan service'.  It's much more realistic and fully appropriate for 12-year-olds or even younger.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the music is absolutely top-notch; the opener is just touching enough to draw you in and at the closing credits  'Inside Identity' thoroughly rocks.  Best of all the animated credits sequences are a perfect snapshot of the series matter itself, accurately illustrating all the characters and posing just enough questions to keep you interested.  Deko's hair-twirlling and dancing on top of her hands is fetchingly cute; and  Rikka's dual finger-spin (both going the same way!) has become a phenomenon (check out Japanese YouTube).  The awkward unpopular-adolescent toe-banging dance Rikka does at the closing credits bespeaks her character perfectly (after all she wears wheelie shoes too!).\\n\\n\r\nDon't miss a single episode this season as 'Chuunibyou' airs on Japanese TV and on the Web.  It's too fun to resist.",

This on the other hand, is an exception! I can't forget the memorable characters and scenes that brought this to life. If i was to use just oneword to describe this anime, i would use the word epic. Not in the sense of \"lol epic shirt man.\" but a real, honest to god epic. It is above and beyond what i expected when i first found it.\\n\\n\r\n      The story is driven by character development, and it's own brand of comedy. Though some tropes and character types are used it works perfectly. Well, i suppose i am not very good at explaining why this is an honest to god epic am i? my only question to you, someone who might not have watched it yet is:\\n\\n\r\n what does it mean to grow up?\\n\\n",

            "content": "I won't lie - I got interested in this because of Rikka's appearance. Weirdly enough, I'm pretty much attracted to characters wearing eyepatches or with cursed eyes, so I thought that I could give this a try. I'm pretty sure I've had Chu2byo myself - there was a time when I pretended that I had some kind of ESP power, although I never used to be as overdramatic as this show's characters are. \r\nPlus, I'm not really a RomCom kind of person, but I always like a nice comedy.\r\nStory - 8\r\nChu2koi's plot is apparently like most Slice of Life anime: high school drama, club activities,random situations. But all of this is caught under a different light - for example the club is basically a \"secret base\" (called \"Eastern Magic Society of Summer Naps\" or something like that), with a fluorescent magic circle on the floor and where \"fights\" against the evil happen, all in the main characters' own imagination. It's all original and that's what makes it so much fun.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nKyoAni is famous for his moe characters that would basically look cute in every situation, but this time the art was a bit different. Simpler but still stunning: I liked this much more than the usual moeness overload. Not to speak about the extraordinary visuals of the parallel world seen in Deko-chan and Rikka's imagination.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nI didn't like the opening as much as other people did - it was okay, but nothing more. \\n\r\nOn the other hand, I loved the ending theme, Inside Identity. So I thought I'd give it an average score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nThis show's forte. It's all based on the characters - they all have some unique features, that make Chu2koi enjoyable. \\n\r\nStarting with its main character, Togashi Yuuta, that I found totally adorable! Especially when he tells himself not to think about his middle school year and starts going crazy. He made me laugh so much. \\n\r\nCalm and a little clueless too, after his chuu2byo experience, he wants to be an average high school student, and to leave his past behind. But as soon as he enters his classroom he meets classmate and \"fellow\" chu2byo named Takanashi Rikka, who instantly recognises as Dark Flame Master. Rikka is cute, funny and sometimes weird - but beneath her bizarre appearance and ethics, a tragedy is buried. And this tragedy is the reason why she feels so close to Yuuta and to his Dark Flame Master alter-ego. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have the other characters;\\n\r\nthe Chu2byo and middle school genius Dekomori Sanae, who refers to herself as \"Rikka's servant\" and is constantly arguing with popular, class rep and former Chu2Byo, Nibutani Shinka or, as Dekomori calls her, \"Nise Mori\";\\n\r\nand last, the only two \"normal\" characters out there : Tsuyuri Kumin, the calm, nap-loving senpai and Isshiki Makoto, Yuuta's first friend, who's in love with Kumin.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this show a lot - not only because it reminded me of my Chu2byo time, but also because it was a really nice comedy, with original plot twist and very good characterisation.\\n\r\nIf you're looking for some light-hearted romance, and anything but ordinary characters, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is certainly the right anime for you (and it will probably keep you hooked to your computer until you finish it). \\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review - sorry if it isn't that good, but this anime had a particular feeling to it that made me want to write one to tell everybody how good is it. \\n\r\nHope it was useful to someone that wasn't sure whether to watch this or not - you won't be disappointed!",

            "content": "\"In order to became a man, I had to surrender what I once loved as a child,\" is how I believe the old saying goes.  Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai, a.k.a Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions!, is a coming-of-age anime about a boy who relinquishes those childish things, in his case the perpetual need to be Hiei's prodigy 24 - 7, only to meet a cute girl who refuses to mature from the phase he grew from.  The result is a budding romance about patience, acceptance, and breaking the barriers of reality.\r\nStory:  8/10\r\nNever before have I seen an anime where the centralconflict is a character stuck in a Peter Pan complex, and Chunibyo portrays the topic smoother than a baby's bottom caked with powder.  Overprotective grandparents, an older sister, and even Yuuta's own chagrin add to the Rikka's conflict, and Yuuta's denial of his younger self and whether he should accept Rikka's idiosyncrasies or reject them add to his.  Of course, as all male protagonist leads in a romance, he may stumble, but never too far to regain his footing for the girl his hormones have begun to kick for.  However, the biggest problem I had with this anime was the lack of one realistic element:  Bullying.  The show got everything else right, but the biggest plague her classmates inflict on her is isolation, not the teasing you'd expect delivered to someone as overtly quirky and shy as herself (Especially in Middle and High School.  We all know how cruel these hormone-induced sociopaths can be).  It would have made a darker show, perhaps wasn't even necessary, but may have pushed it from an 8 to a 9 depending on how the writers dealt with the subject.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  10/10\\n\r\nI don't go around with my nose-up at art exhibits for a living, nor can I tell you the intricacies of Japanese art history, but as your average aficionado of anime, I had no complaints.  The transitions between Rikka's imaginary world of giant hammers, laser beams, and cataclysmic-collateral damage and reality was done beautifully, and even provided comedic effect when shown what normal people see outside her imaginary world.  The Moe force is strong with this one, but not quite on Kanon and Clannad level, which is a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nNothing in the soundtrack stood out personally, but the Japanese voice actors did a stellar job.  Rikka's nonsensical dialogue isn't always nonsensical and had me laughing off my seat, reminding me of Okabe's beloved madness from Steins;Gate (only he's actually a scientist/inventor and Rikka's...  just a crazy little girl).  This just doesn't apply to Rikka, for most of the main cast has a duality shifting from normal high school student to fun and delusional, and the voice actors present this dichotomy in satisfying style.  I haven't seen the English Dub yet.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  7/10\\n\r\nThe performances were great, the substance leaving something desired.  Your standard tropes are present:  You have your male lead (Yuuta) who's the only guy with the guts to speak to this cute, loner girl (And who, fortunately, isn't a jerk that wants to take advantage of that).  You have Rikka, the loner girl who's, naturally, the most interesting cast member.  You also have your loli (Sanae), your normal girl (Shibutani), your big-breasted ditz (Kumin), and the loser friend to make the male lead look better by comparison who's ACTUALLY the average joe (Makoto.  No, not that Makoto.  Put your pitch-forks down, please).  Yuuta and Rikka get the most development,  bread crumbs are left concerning the history of the others, two of their team get no development whatsoever.  The three stars of the main cast (Rikka, Shibutani, and Yuuta) push the characterization from a 6 to a 7.  It was done well, but could have done better.  Oh:  A special shout-out goes to  Rikka's older sister, Tooka, for being the most awesome character in the show. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Conclusion:  \\n\r\nRikka Takanashi was a dimension unto herself.  As a matter of fact, her character was a multiverse, and probably the biggest thing that'll make me come back to this series in the future.  The story of Chunibyou is a story of the delusions we create for ourselves to cope with reality versus the reality we have to face.  Will we ever have to truly face that reality?  Some may say yes because it's unhealthy to deny the truths before our eyes.  Some say no because utterly accepting reality sacrifices the Romanticism that makes us transcend our debilitating condition.  What answer does Chunibyou provide?  You'll have to watch it yourself to find out ;).  Fans of Romance anime, like myself, especially those looking for a slight deviation from the overused drama scenarios used in romances, should definitely give this one a peek.  It's not a Clannad or Ef: A Tale of Memories, but it's definitely worth your time.\\n\\n\r\nUltimate Technique:  Final Judgment, Slashing Score!  \\n\r\n7 out of 10    \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Considering many may only skim the first paragraph of this review I may as well put my main impression here. Is Chuunibyou a bad show? No, it's quite enjoyable. On the other hand is Chuunibyou the greatest thing since sliced bread and Chuck Norris combined with a man fist-fighting a dragon? Don't be ridiculous. Many fans will attempt to fool you into thinking that Chuunibyou is deeper than it actually is. What it really is just simple mindless entertainment and on that regard it works well.\r\nFirst off some words about KyoAni. To those of you who have seen their work you will find familiar territoryhere. Much like all there other words this piece lies within there safe zone and truly is a foreboding sign. Chuunibyou gives us a small example of what KyoAni could do if they used their powers for good instead of evil with some well animated fight scenes. However I am afraid this studio shall always be one sorely lacking in ambition. What is worse it seems KyoAni has found a formula which means most if not all further KyoAni features will have a similar vibe till the day comes that it stops making them money. A day not coming anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\nAlright enough on this. Chuunibyou hits everyone hard with a concept anyone can relate to, an embarrassing childhood. For those who have not read the description it's about a syndrome which a person who pretends to believe that he is a being with special powers and tries to summon creatures, fight and other things one can expect from a fantasy anime character. Our main who previously suffered from this meets Rikka, a girl who is currently going through the same phase. A club is made, others join who have similar experiences and hijinks ensue. This is the plot of the first half. The second half delves into a more serious storyline involving a trauma from the heroines past. This is were the show weakens. A romance is pulled out of nowhere, drama and angst appear over some truly small matters and the ultimate moral we all saw coming appears.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is to KyoAni standards. Though much like their other works the soundtrack is minimal. I can honestly say I enjoyed this more than their previous work Hyouka which I found to be a massive waste of excellent production values. The comedy was impressive considering it managed to get a smile out of me, a person who rarely laughs at anime comedy. The character quirks are likable however their shallowness is exposed in the second half as the drama is dialed up. Really I say what really knocked down the score was that attempt to emulate Key writing which on the whole is not writing which should be copied. Cheap manipulative writing may be effective but on the whole if the emotional impact is not achieved it is contrived and insulting.\\n\\n\r\nThe final episode attempted to compare Chuunibyouism with general ambition to prove yourself special. However this was quite preachy and not true as it was similar to comparing a cosplayer to a writer. Both may be passionate but what they do is entirely different. \\n\r\nSo I leave with this, Chuunibyou is a nice time waster. Nothing more than that. When it attempts to try to become something of a more serious nature it loses value but if that manages to appeal to you then you could find it a rewarding experience. Me on the other hand will sit back and wait till KyoAni takes a real risk.",

            "content": "What does it mean to be happy? Some people would tell you that being rich or famous is their ultimate dream. Now that could be true for a lot of people, but for me, however; self-acceptance is my one true wish.\r\nGrowing up can be an awkward and intimidating process for some of us. I'm sure that we have all done or said some things in the past that we look back on in regret or embarrassment, so when you get thrown into this cruel and unforgiving world where social norms are prevalent and people are very critical of you, the thought of having people findingthe dark secrets of your past could be very detrimental to yourself.\\n\\n\r\nI have spent most of my life slaving over each and every single little mistake I have made and forcing myself to act like everyone else in the hopes that people will finally accept me. Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! taught me that it is okay to be weird and different. That you don't need to be like everyone else in order to be happy. That loving yourself is the only thing you need to do in order to achieve happiness.\\n\\n\r\nWatching Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is like taking a trip to memory lane and reflecting on all the best moments that life has to offer when you're young and delusional. Rikka is kind of like the representation of your childhood while Yuuta reflects more of what adolescence is like and watching these two adorable goofballs talking to each other fills my heart with a warm feeling of nostalgia that I simply haven't felt before in anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is one of the best that anime has to offer. Everybody here is a likeable dork and the character animation is always spot on and perfectly compliments the series' sense of slapstick and over the top humor. You will often see these really detailed fight scenes where characters use huge swords or shoot magic stuff at each other, only to then cut to a scene showing the characters actually just lightly wailing on each other in the adorable KyoAni-fashion. Even if you can see a joke coming, the execution and delivery of it all is so delightful that it's impossible to not crack a big dumb smile. But while Dekomori, Nibutani and everybody \\n\r\nelse are also great characters in their own right; the bond between Rikka and Yuuta takes the cake here. Seeing Yuuta accepting his past in order to get closer to Rikka out of sheer love honestly gave me the inspiration to do the same with myself. After all, as long as you're not hurting anybody, why should you feel bad for who you truly are on the inside?\\n\\n\r\nEven the opening feels like it's trying to amplify the show's message of clashing personality types with its visuals. However, Mother's Basement already made a great video on this opening in his \"Top 5 BEST Kyoto Animation Anime Openings\" so I would recommend that you go watch that video instead because otherwise I would just repeat everything he said.\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is a very personal and important show to me. If I were to ever get trapped on a deserted island and I had to pick one anime that would be the only source of entertainment for the rest of my life, then Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! would be that anime. No other anime has made me as happy as this show has and I still cry tears of joy every time I even think about it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are somebody that has struggled with self-acceptance in the past, then I would highly recommend this show to you! Even if you didn't feel the same way I do, the show has such an unparalleled charm to it that it should make for an enjoyable experience nonetheless.",

They built a whole silly atmosphere for the show using only funny scenes and dialogues, and it was funny enough for me to keep watching.\r\nI've been watching it just for the comedy content which was kinda funny. Loved Rikka's dialogues (the subs where I watched were amazingly done) and the MC's acting as a shounen battle characters. The art at those scenes were cool also.\r\n[Minor spoiler below]\r\nBut when it comes to the last 3 episodes (episode 10 specially), dude, they destroyed (or should I say V A NI S H E D) everything like they didn't even care. FXCKING LOVE IT. It was a brilliant play, building the character and making us to like Rikka just to drama-slap you in the face with the reality stuff. \\n\\n\r\nThat's all I wanted to say. I was going to write a shorter \"review\" but MAL didn't let me. So that's it, Chuunibyou 1st season was awesome.",

            "content": "Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is a comedy/romance/slice of life 2012 anime produced by the famous Kyoto Animation. The story follows Yuuta Togashi, a high school boy who had chuunibyou (eight grader syndrome) and believed himself to be the Dark Flame Master. He moves high schools and plans leave his embarrassing past behind and start a new leaf. However, this plan becomes null once he meets Rikka Takanashi, a high school student who has chuunibyou and believes that she possesses a \"wicked eye\" and is in search of the Ethereal Horizon. Rikka befriends Yuuta and ruins his chance for a possibly normal life. The animebrings in great comedy and a wonderful smash of romance towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I first started Chuunibyou, I was a bit wary because I feared that it would just be a harem or a slow paced anime. However, I shouldn't have doubted the works of Kyoto Animation because I got quite the treat. The anime is hilarious, bringing me to actual stomach-hurting laughter more than one time. Yet, as you progress on further, you find out that there is hidden meaning and back stories that create dramatic tension all throughout. Additionally, the romance within it was absolutely adorable and showed the loving innocence between two die hard nerds. The animation flows terrfically and the few fight scenes are so entertaining to watch and easy to follow, as expected of KyoAni. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, what made me happiest of all about this anime was the overall moral that it sends you; always stay true to yourself. It really is okay to express yourself no matter who you are, even if society doesn't accept you that way. If that's what makes you happy, then pursue it. Surely you'll find your own Yuuta and Dekomori and find happiness. \\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai was definitely a success for me, despite a somewhat slow start. I fully enjoyed the story, comedy, and romance with the stunning high quality animation. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys anyone of the genres that I mentioned above. I rate the anime a 9.2/10.",

            "content": "*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*\r\nLife can be boring, lonely and even painful at times. We humans naturally tend to avoid these feelings because of the discomfort they give us. We try to run away from them, but it is no use. Reality is all around as, and there is no place for us to hide. Our only option is to blast reality..and burst it into shreds!\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai focuses on a girl who does just that. She cannot accept reality, so she denies the fact that it's there. This girl opposes reality by being a Chuunibyou. But you might be wondering...what is a Chuunibyou?By definition, a Chuunibyou is someone who pretends like they are in junior high/8th grade. 8th graders are believed to discover new self-awareness at this time in their life. They often pretend to be something they are not. For example, a super hero or an evil villain. By being a Chuunibyou, these people can successfully escape from reality by being the someone or something that they want to be.\\n\\n\r\nOur story starts with a boy by the name of Togashi, Yuuta. Yuuta has spent his 8th grade year pretending to be the Dark Flame Master. In other words, he was a Chuunibyou. Now that he is a high-school student, he looks back at that time in his life shamefully. He is extremely embarrassed about being a Chuunibyou and even moves to a faraway high-school to avoid his classmates in middle school. Yuuta just wants to be a normal student now, and make new friends. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have Takanashi, Rikka. She is a girl who has just become a Chuunibyou. Rikka is in the same class as Yuuta and takes an interest in him. Of course, Yuuta wants nothing to do with her. He wants to seem as normal as possible to his new classmates in high-school.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so the two's hilarious little adventure ensues.\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou goes through two major shifts in its story. The first half of it is a happy going tale about Yuuta and Rikka's interaction with each other. This slowly builds up an understanding between the two, and that understanding eventually builds up in to love. The second half is a more dramatic and meaningful story. The theme is clearly visible in the second half as Rika comes to terms with growing up and accepting reality. That is to say the first half was more happy and silly, while the second half was more depressing. All in all, the story can be summed up as short, sweet, simple, and silly. It is told near flawlessly with many laughs along the way. The relationships were not rushed, and everything progresses smoothly. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the characters... this is what i loved most about Chuunibyou. They have fun personalities and very entertaining dialog. They are all a lovable bunch who develop naturally in their own ways. My favorite of the bunch would definitely have to be the heroine, Rikka.\\n\\n\r\nRikka has become one my favorite anime characters this year. She can be defined just like the story. Short, sweet, simple, and silly...well not really simple. She is very complex in the way she acts. It sometimes becomes difficult to understand her speech without Yuuta there to translate it, but that is just how she is. Rikka pretends that she wields a power called \"The Wicked Eye\", and she uses it to search for a place called the \"Ethereal Horizon\". That is her Chuunibyou. She diligently follows this idea throughout the story until we reach the shift as i like to call it. We discover why she acts the way she does as the plot moves in to its more dramatic side. Rikka shows much character development here as she learns what it means to love and fit into society. This is all done at a reasonable pace that the viewers can enjoy. It becomes very entertaining to watch her fall in love and learn what love is; however, it  was very sad seeing Rikka force herself to stop being a Chuunibyou. She becomes a relatable character because everyone has problems that they want to escape from. Most of us tend to want to escape to a different reality as well. Isn't that more or less why we watch anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe most lovable part of Rikka's character was probably her Chuunibyou acts and her interactions with Yuuta. Rika would go around the streets swinging an umbrella around and yell weird phrases. She would do the goofiest things while looking extremely cute. Rikka did not care what others thought of her actions. Because of this, Rikka goes on to do weird and comical things that may seem stupid to some. For example, she would yell out \"BANISHMENT... THIS WORLD!\" and get into a imaginary battles with people. I like to say that \" it's so stupid, it's funny\". Her interactions with Yuuta are also very amusing to watch. Yuuta would hit her on the head whenever Rikka did something wrong or weird. This causes Rikka to make the cutest little moaning sound. When Rikka starts to fall in love with Yuuta, she begins to blush a lot and act more \"girly\". If i had to sum up Rika in one word, it would have to be ADORABLE.\\n\\n\r\nYuuta, the other main character, has a little less going for him. He is far from boring, but Rikka's dynamic character simply seems to overshadow his. Yuuta goes crazy whenever someone mentions his pass \"Dark Flame Master\" identity.This is what makes him realistic because people are naturally embarrassed about doing things that society deems unnatural.He wants nothing to do with Chuunibyous, but Rikka slowly begins to change him. He starts to become more understanding and ends up being a very good match for Rikka.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs further increases the characters likability, especially Rikka's cuteness. They are simple and plain, yet very appealing. As expected from Kyoto animations. A wonderful job was done with the scenery and the animations. Lights in the horizon and the imaginary Chuunibyou fights looked spectacular.  Everything was wonderful to the point of breathtaking. The only problem i had was the repeated flashing and dancing in the opening that was quite seizure inducing.\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much to say for the sound quality. I enjoyed the catchy opening song, and the ending song had a nice beat to it, but i did not feel like the ending song fit the mood very well for the last few episodes . The episode would end on a sad note and then this somewhat goofy song would start playing, and that kinda killed the mood for me.The opening song went well with the whole twelve episode though. The BGMs were all plain and nice. They fit the simple high-school days mood very well. Voice acting was also spot on. Uchidia, Maaya brought out Rikka's adorableness even further with her delighful voice. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up, Chuunibyou is simply an amazing anime. The concept is so simple yet so unique.It is a love story with themes about growing up and being yourself, but they tell it in the most amusing of ways. A fine example for all romantic comedies out there. Definitely check it out, and i'll see you in the Ethereal Horizon.",

            "content": "I'm not the biggest KyoAni fan in the world. I love them as much as the next guy, but I haven't seen everything they've done, and I didn't love everything I saw. Even so, I feel like I can say with some confidence that Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai might be the pinnacle of what this studio does best.\r\nOn the surface, this is a solid romantic comedy centered around characters who are either afflicted with or recovering from the titular Chuunibyou (translated by Hulu as \"eighth-grader syndrome\"), with some delicious bits of drama thrown in for good measure, but if you've seen other KyoAni showsyou know that that's not what it's REALLY about. Chu-2 is a really touching and funny show about falling in love while growing up and figuring out who you really are. There's a bit more to it than that, but believe me when I say it's worth it to watch the show and figure the rest out for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is expertly written, start to finish. The characters are charming and likable, although I may be biased since the characters with the titular Chuunibyou delusions hit a little to close to home for me. The larger plot transitions smoothly and naturally between moments of romance, comedy, and drama to the point where you might not immediately notice the switch in some places. Even in the more comedic sections of the plot, you'll be invested in the characters and their budding romances. True to form for Kyoto Animation, the show really tugs on your heartstrings, and the final episode really touched me in a way that no show really has since I watched Angel Beats for the first time a few years ago.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest should be obvious considering the studio. The art is absolutely gorgeous to look at, and the animation is fluid and lively. The dialogue is convincing and well-acted. The OP and end credit songs are great. The rest of the soundtrack is well put together as well; it really blends with the scene and pulls it together well, but the flipside to that is that it does sort of fade into the background. It's well-done, but not especially remarkable on its own. \\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai is expertly made from start to finish. The solid comedy, touching plot, and lovable characters will keep you hooked from start to finish. If you're a fan of romance, comedy, or emotional drama, this show might be about as good as it gets.",

The anime mostly follows your typical highschool romantic comedy however Rikka is a chuunibyou. (Note Chuunibyou translates to middle school 2nd year syndrome).\r\nStory execution: The first few episodes don't take themselves seriously its more about the laughs we get introduced to some new characters such as Rikka's friend Dekomori and Yuta's new friend Isshiki and much more. The showdoesn't start taking itself seriously until the final 4 or 5 episodes thats when the show starts to drift from its comedy standpoint to a more romantic as Rikka and Yuta's relationship starts to develop.\\n\\n\r\nIm not gonna talk about the ending as it is something you should experience yourself this anime was a wonderful thing to experience. I will never forget those days watching this especially those final episodes. I whole heartily recommend this for anyone who is searching for a good watch. And Fin \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!: A Series That Stays True To The Self\r\nI'm not sure how KyoAni does it, but they always seem to surprise me. I originally passed up this series when it first debuted because it had the appearance of a moe harem series that's strictly a romantic comedy. However, if you came into this series thinking that's all it would be, you would be sorely mistaken. Chuunibyou is a series about staying true to yourself, no matter how strange or weird some people would perceive you as.\r\nHonestly speaking, my favorite part of this series was the message behind it. This series revolvesheavily around the process of \"growing up.\" While I don't want to spoil it, the series does heavily address the issue of whether giving up your own creative individuality and forgetting your childhood fantasies is for the best. It also revolves around how one person's fantasies can serve as an inspiration to others. There are many semi-subliminal messages that carry on throughout the series, especially in the latter half. While I know my explanation might seem somewhat vague, it will make more sense as you watch the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around Yuuta, a boy entering his freshman year of high school after completely abandoning his \"chuunibyou\" or \"eighth grade delusion,\" of being a otherworldly warrior known as the Dark Flame Master out of embarrassment. However, the night before his first day in this HS, he meets Rikka, a girl he later finds out is in his HS class that lives in the floor above him climbing down a rope outside his balcony and assists in her escape. He learns that this eye-patch wearing girl also has a chuunibyou that she calls the \"Wicked Eye\" and is searching for the \"Ethereal Horizon.\" Rikka spends much of her time around Yuuta, claiming how the Wicked Eye calls out for him to assist in her search and she even tries to start a hobby club revolving around magic users and the like. At the very least, that's how this series starts out, but it eventually revolves around the reasons for Rikka having this chuunibyou. Overall, the story is pretty decent and the characters are also quite interesting as well.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the two leads, this series had an intriguing supporting cast. You had Kumin, a pure and innocent girl with an obsession for naps, Sanae, a hyperactive girl with a vivid imagination that refers to Rikka as \"master\", and Shinka, the popular girl in the class who joins the club to destroy the evidence of her own previously abandoned chuunibyou that Sanae possesses. Makoto, Yuuta's class friend also joins the club later on. While this didn't have that much of a \"club\" focus, I found what made these characters interesting was how they all tied into each other during the series and the events that happened during the series that built their characters. Unfortunately, there isn't really much character back story for anyone besides Rikka, but at the same time, it didn't feel that necessary for this series. Each member of the club, as well as Touka, Rikka's sister serve more as support for the two leads, rather than each getting their own individual story arc. My biggest beef with the character development was that I really wish it would've built a bit more on Yuuta's character because his role becomes quite amplified later on in the series. It just felt like if Yuuta's character was developed even more, it would've only helped as this series reached it's climax.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was pretty good, but not breathtaking, especially when it comes to KyoAni. The character designs are EXTREMELY similar to K-ON! and Hyouka, although that seems to be KyoAni's trademark at the moment, much like how Air, Kanon, and Clannad were KyoAni's staple character design during the late 2000s. Although, one interesting aspect I found about the animation was just how vivid they made the delusions, especially in the fight scenes. It would make for a very hilarious segue from an epic fantasy fight between Rikka and Touka to seeing the two fight each other with an umbrella and a soup ladle.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it came to the weaknesses of this series, I'll admit that the pacing was sort of choppy. It had its parts that seemed to progress the plot pretty quickly and then bring it to an all-out stand still. There do also seem to be some minor events within the series that mostly serve as \"plot convenience,\" especially toward the end. One of the minor gripes I do have about this series is that I wish it was a bit longer. While the series was able to accomplish quite a bit in 12 episodes, there was an awful lot of character development and story building that could've been done to turn this into a 24 episode series. I would say it was part of the reason why the pacing of this series felt so jerky. Since it was only 12 episodes, it only really had time to develop Yuuta and Rikka's relationship, but not much of anyone else. It's a shame, because the supporting cast had a lot of character to develop. I mentioned it earlier, but Yuuta's character development felt slightly too shallow, especially considering the message the series was trying to push across.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, Chuunibyou is one of those series that will make you feel like a kid again, especially if you were the creative, imaginative type. It's one of those series that will make you contemplate the significance of giving up individuality for social conformity. In my honest opinion, I believe the series does a remarkable job of showing how important being true to yourself is and how your own personal creativity can serve as an inspiration to others. It's a powerful series in that regard. While I wouldn't call this one of KyoAni's best works, it is still a pretty strong series. If you're looking for a nice romantic comedy with some interesting social commentary and a bit of subliminal messaging, Chuunibyou is the way to go.",

            "content": "Chuunibyou. I'm not quite sure that this syndrome exist, but god how funny would it be !!! Imagine your best friend comming at school with a bandage, saying that he cannot remove it as he would risk to liberate the dragon ! This is how Chuunibyou rules. \r\nAs you now know, this anime is one of the most funny I've seen. But he got another goal sentimental: it reminds you of your school years, during which time we laugh, we take the shame, we have fun, we cry, we love ... That's the strongest point of this anime, that's why some people can have acrush on it. Let's begin :\\n\\n\r\nStory : 8.\\n\r\nOne word : Original, as we can expect now from Japanese scenarists. The idea of \u200b\u200bmixing reality and fiction into a disease is just extraordinary. The setting of school is in favor of that. So now the Comedy is in place, i would say strongly in place. Then begin the Romance, and despite what I thought at first, it was not bad at all. Anyway, I think this would have been better to continue into a pure Comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8.\\n\r\nWhat can i say? Proper. This is not my favourite art but it was ok. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 9.\\n\r\nOh god, the best ending ever ! I hear it all day long. Opening is great too.The juggling between the normal sound, and the sound when we enter a 'fight' is quite interessting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 10.\\n\r\nTo make characters like the Dark Flame Master, Jao Shingan etc... you should have a nice imagination ! They are very endearing. When we see how having chuunibyou is a trouble, we necessarily understand the shame Yuuta feel. Rikka is nice too, she has nothing to do with what others think, she is natural at all. My favourite is Nibutani : how can we guess that the most beautiful girl in the class had written that she was a witch than 400 years on the internet? She's really funny.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 10.\\n\r\nIt's so funny to watch the embarassing situations that cause Rikka to Yuuta. As i said, this anime is one of the funniest com-rom i ever saw. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9.\\n\r\nChuunibyou is intended for people nostalgic for their school years, to those who are still there, and even those who will enter it. This is its strength. A lot of people will identify themself to the characters. To me, it's a must-to-watch. To dislike it, you should hate KyoAni, or your school days...",

            "content": "Call me a nit picker but that was the worst ending to anime anime since Evangelion. The ending was reminiscent of an American rom com ending. The forced police officer was not important at all, didn't add humor, and didn't create tension, which was the whole point. The letter was fucking bullshit. Not only did it appear out of nowhere, but the Mayan calender reference was just a stupid idea. The bicycle scene was ridiculous. While we don't know where Rikka's mom lives, we can assume that he was riding for over 10 miles. If the distance between them was so small, then why didYuuta need to go visit her when he could have taken a train the next day? How did a 14 year old skinny Japanese boy drive a bicycle 10+ miles? Why did he scream at the top of his lungs when she obviously would hear him? Why did the police officer continue to chase them at the end? Why did the grandpa feel so threatened by Yuuta after Yuuta and Rikka embraced? Why did Dekomori bring everyone to Rikkas house, really? Did Deko want to see Rikka so much? If that was the case why didn't she offer to take Yuuta? Why did the mexican have to become a molester? How did he out run a police officer?\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, it is a accumulation of these little ideas that are just bad. Together, they bring down an otherwise average ending.",

            "content": "What is true happiness? Is it living a life full of material possessions? Is it being accepted within the social group of your dreams? Or, is it something much simpler?\r\nThe beauty of Chuunibyou is the beauty of simplicity; it is a simple story that preaches a simple message. Stagnated by the analytic mind, expectations of deep, continuous melodrama, or some longing for a nonsensical philosophical message, popular reception of this show might go along the lines of \u201cwell, I was expecting more\u201d or conversely, a simple \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting anything at all.\u201d \r\nChuunibyou Demo Koi ga Shitai! (Chuu2) manages to find a rather fitting equilibriumthat is almost reminiscent of a Disney work. An entertaining, yet touching story that will likely leave that warm fuzzy feeling when all has been said and done.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nTogashi Yuuta once suffered from a \u201cdisease\u201d known as chuunibyou, or eighth-grade syndrome. Once absorbed in his own fantastical world, Yuuta now aims for a simple high school life as he enters his first year, hoping to leave his embarrassing past behind. However it turns out that, like his delusions, his hopes of a picture-perfect high school life become a distant dream thanks to a \u201cmysterious\u201d girl, Takanashi Rikka, who just happens to be inflicted with the same unfortunate disease that plagued Yuuta\u2019s past. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the story was rather slow. A misleading beginning full of tomfoolery and antics led the audience to believe that the show had nothing to offer. Given only 12 episodes, one would expect development to hit faster to prevent pacing issues, but unfortunately, director Ishihara Tatsuya might have dwelled in this overly lighthearted realm for a bit too long. It burned in that mood so deeply into memory that it felt as if any change of tone or pacing would be rather awkward. Surprisingly, although there were some awkward moments, the transition into a more serious tone felt mostly natural and didn\u2019t seem to try too hard to be something that it was not.     \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the story\u2019s strength was definitely its identity. Simply put, the entire series not only had the consistent elements of a romantic comedy, but also boasted some unique elements that differentiated the show from others. Even with its transition in the latter half, the comedy quota is definitely lowered, but never abolished. Additionally, one of the most unique points of the chuu2 story is the illusionary world (I\u2019ll call it that from now on) the characters conjure up through their imaginations. This element is consistently used as a story-telling medium, and it is both fitting and frankly, pretty to look at. Although some may argue this point as careless overemphasizing of certain emotions, I believe that is the point. Aren\u2019t we dealing with delusional kids anyways?    \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story does suffer slightly from some pacing issues. Personally, I would have preferred if they spent one less episode fooling around, and in turn, use that additional episode to develop the relationship between Yuuta and Rikka some more. Nonetheless, the overall experience of the story was both funny and touching, and it is a breath of fresh air from some other romantic comedy formulas.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAs always, Kyoto Animation delivers in the animation department. Character designs are rather simple and familiar, but they\u2019re cute like always. However, in chuu2 there were two major elements of the art and animation that wowed me. Scenes in the illusionary world were obvious budget dumps. These scenes consistently deliver the high quality, seemingly ridiculous eye candy that any anime fan would love to watch. As stated before, these scenes serve more of a purpose than just eye candy. Essentially, they become the trademark of the series. Using this medium provides a fresh perspective on dealing with the generic scenes you might see in a typical romantic comedy. The second element exists in the form of the atmosphere. Kyoani deliberately sets fitting settings and tones that augment the emotions of a scene. True to the \u201cAdolescent Delusions of Grandeur\u201d the official English name of the series boasts, the tone of the background carries out its job successfully. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, I was definitely surprised of how well the OST was constructed. Most notable were the tracks done on either a very passionate violin or likely a viola. Those certain tracks were memorable, quality tracks. However, the BGM that plays during the \u201cnormal\u201d interactions between the characters is decent, but a tad forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening, Sparkling Daydream by ZAQ, fits the tone of the series well. It is a catchy song that unfortunately, starts to not fit too well with the continuity of the episodes (who remembers torch from after story? Ya, it\u2019s like that). Similarly, the ending, Inside Identity, sung by the female cast and composed by ZAQ, is also a very catchy tune that, like the opening, fits perfectly in the first half, but starts to feel a bit off in the second.\\n\\n\r\nThe best-executed element of the sound category was definitely the voice acting. Jun Fukuyama\u2019s role of Yuuta was fitting considering how well the Lelouch voice was for Yuuta\u2019s old chuunibyou \u201calter ego,\u201d Dark Flame Master. Maaya Uchida\u2019s voice also perfectly fitted Rikka\u2019s naturally timid personality. Most notable, however, was Sumire Uesaka\u2019s outstanding performance of Dekomori Sanae. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound set of Chuu2 as a whole was well-executed. Although there were a few inconsistencies here or there, excellence in voice acting and in certain OST tracks made sound an important factor in the success of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (Minor spoilers with story direction. No overly specific spoilers here)\\n\\n\r\nNow here\u2019s where it gets a bit tricky. The basic character models of chuu2 are rather generic. You could probably find similar character types in several different shows, and one character in particular, was questionably inconsistent. However, the decision to differentiate the main characters into specific pairings helped breathe life into an initially stagnant cast. We start with our hopeless hero who just longs for love, and our crazy, arguably mentally impaired heroine at his side. Add in a cast of 3 more beautiful girls and throw in your comedic relief guy friend and we\u2019ve got a generic harem series right? \\n\\n\r\nChuu2 realized what they were degenerating into and took action quickly. From here, we see 3 differentiable pairs: Yuuta/Rikka, Sanae/Shinka, and Isshiki/Kumin. Although scenes often incorporate most to all of the characters interacting at once, the viewer can see these pairs develop individually. For the Yuuta/Rikka pair, Yuuta is able to develop into more than just a generic hopeless male lead and Rikka becomes more than a moeblob and actually has a shy personality. Similarly, our primary comedic relief pairing, Sanae and Shinka, quickly grow onto the audience with their constant exchanges. Unfortunately, the one miss Ishihara had was with Isshiki and Kumin. Although Isshiki still served his role as Yuuta\u2019s \u201cbro\u201d amongst other pursuits, these two characters showed promise, but fell off in the end. Furthermore, Rikka\u2019s older sister, Tooka, had some minor inconsistencies in her character when it came to reacting to Rikka\u2019s behavior. \\n\\n\r\nTo my pleasant surprise, the cast of characters was a rather memorable one. Headed by the Yuuta/Rikka pair, the story was able to give most of the characters definition. Given that around half of the cast were original characters not in the light novel, Kyoani did a great job with characters this time around. We have no complicated love triangle, no unnecessary high school drama, and as a result, we leave satisfied with a simple, yet unique romantic comedy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nAs I state in every review, enjoyment is a completely personal category that some reviewers tend to shy away from. Personally, I enjoyed every minute of the series. I came in expecting a romantic comedy, and I finished the show almost completely satisfied. The show\u2019s humor is entertaining, and the story\u2019s touching twist is a memorable one. \\n\\n\r\nThe big questions remains: should you take the series seriously? Well, that\u2019s a yes and a no. I approached it as a romantic comedy and got everything out of it. If you take it too seriously or if you don\u2019t take it seriously enough, you probably won\u2019t be completely satisfied. It\u2019s important to remember that romance is generally a more serious genre whereas comedy is not. The \u201cseriousness scale\u201d of the romantic comedy genre in general is pretty iffy to begin with. All questions aside, overall this was definitely the most enjoyable show of the season for me. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the entirety of chuu2 is based off a simple premise. It is the manner of which the story is portrayed that leads some to question whether one is supposed to take this story seriously or not. If you overcomplicate or overestimate the \u201cmessages\u201d the show sends, you\u2019re missing the point. I mean, you usually don\u2019t open a bag of chips expecting candy. Likewise, take chuu2 in a similar manner. Enjoy it as a simple romantic comedy and chances are, you\u2019ll be in for a great ride.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.6/10 \\n",

Of course there is Nibutani where I can relate to as a dominant girl where she puts things in order, though she does have that side where bring up her past really make's here go bananas. Kumin and Makoto, well they do provide that love team, that is if Makoto would have just gone with the flow on her that having 2nd thoughts as to what to do next. Sanae........oh Sanae, I would have like to give that girl some of mine Karate chop, I it were only possible, then again there is Toka who is Rikka's elder sister, I love the way she does her tough love on her.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment-  that's as good as it gets.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - well, it's good, since despite of all its short comings and my desire to wanna hit Rikka and Sanae in the head with a hard paper fan to put some sense in them. \\n",

            "content": "This is my review on Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! \r\nDo you remember when you were younger and you imagine yourself living the life of some bad ass anime hero being all cool and stuff? Do you look back at it now and become embarrassed by it? Well, that's where we meet our main male protagonist, Yuuta Togashi; a young man just starting school at a high school very...very...VERY far away from his middle school to avoid anyone that knew him when he had something called \"the eighth-grader syndrome\", which is what I described above. One night, he meets a girl named Rikka Takanashi, whowill also be attending her first day of high school along with Yuuta. The only problem is, she is still suffering from 'eighth-grader syndrome'. She almost immediately discovers Yuuta's past of him being what he called himself \"Dark Flame Master\", and becomes greatly embarrassed every time it's brought up. Soon, these two encounter other main characters such as Shinka Nibutani, the class rep, Kumin Tsuyuri, a girl who naps a lot, and Sanae Dekomori, Rikka's \"apprentice\". Hilarity ensures.\\n\\n\r\nNow, as to refrain from spoilers, I will be avoiding episodes 7-12. But besides that, this anime really surprised me. At first, it was about what I said above; humor involving someone who use to live in a fantasy world try and cope with now living next door to someone who remains in said fantasy world. Then, the show pulls a \"7th episode twist\", where the mood mostly changes into something more serious half-way through a 13-14 episode anime. We discover why Rikka stayed in her \"eighth-grader syndrome\" and what made her so interested in Yuuta's \"Dark Flame Master\" past. One thing why this starts hitting home is because a lot of us were probably like that, myself included. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I was younger, I went through a bit of an \"eighth-grader syndrome\" that stayed with me a little bit longer than it should have. While it was not as serious as Rikka or Yuuta's, I still feel embarrassed when I remember 'believing' in the Tails Doll, making maps of where the seven Chaos Emeralds were via Google Earth, wear my jean jacket just over my shoulders, keep 02 or Marx from Kirby sealed away, etc. And while I will try to act like I never did those sort of things, I'm glad that a small bit of it is still a part of me. If I had let go of it completely, I probably would be very different than I am today. I might not still have five Lightsabers in my room, I probably wouldn't have so many amazing new friends, and I wouldn't have a wall scroll of Hatsune Miku on my damn wall!\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress; Chu-2 gives us a lesson about growing up and facing reality, but you don't need to abandon your imagination altogether just to grow up. It's okay to have had the \"eighth-grader syndrome\", it's okay to keep some mementos from when you fought evil with your PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWER!!!, and it's okay to be embarrassed about it. Just don't leave it behind forever. So, all in all, if you were once someone that thought you were some bad ass anime hero when you were younger, I would recommend giving this show a try. Season two is currently ongoing, so check it out as well once you're done with this one. It may just remind you of how embarrassing it was to be in your own fantasy world.",

            "content": "All media, especially comedy, will always strike a chord with an audience if it deals with a subject that they would find uncomfortable or too embarassing to discuss in their real lives. Of course, when an anime about how in our childhood we all acted in embarassing ways we'd rather leave behind, it really encapsulates that idea well. Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai is that show, but whilst it initially impressed me with it's humour and well animated fantastical battles, the way in which the momentum of the show shifted in the latter episodes left a bad taste in the mouth.\r\nI'll talk first about thetechnical aspects of Chuunibyou, as they're arguably the most objective. A lot has been made, at least in the west, about how 'Kyoani's shows all look the same'. The complaint has also been made about Chuunibyou looking similar to K-ON!. However, this is wrong. Chuunibyou and Kyoani have quite distinctive art styles, no doubt due to the fact that the character designers are two different people (Kazumi Ikeda compared to K-ON!'s Yukiko Horiguchi). Kyoani's regular fantastic animation quality is not absent here, with fluid animation and a lack of any undetailed frames in the foreground throughout the entirety of the show. The animation budget and talent is especially shown off during the episodic fight scene, where Kyoani really brings the 'magic' of the scene to life with a stunning amount of frames and effects. Almost makes one wonder what may become of Kyoani producing a proper action anime in the modern era (not having done so since Full Metal Panic). \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is unremarkable but unsurprisingly solid. Both the OP and ED are catchy, and the music used from scene to scene always captures the mood capably. None of the OST tracks particularly stood out as excellent, though, but none of them were poor or overused enough to get on my nerves either.\\n\\n\r\nI'll try and combine both character and story because both of these are inherently linked. I'll also do my best to avoid any spoilers. Initially, the 'story' of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! was about Yuuta trying to overcome his past sufferings of his \"chuunibyou\" (or 'adolescent delusions of grandeur syndrome'), which caused him to be the \"Dark Flame Master\" in middle school, going so far as to commute to a highschool quite far away from where he lives in order to start anew. This hope of his is shattered, however, when he meets a girl named Rikka who is suffering quite badly from this chuunibyou condition and seems to be fascinated with Yuuta and hiss being the Dark Flame Master. As one would expect, this leads to a very humorous series of events, and more characters are introduced such as Sanae Dekomori (a current sufferer) and Shinka Nibutani (a girl who, like Yuuta, is trying to leave her Chuuni past behind and lead a normal highschool life). \\n\\n\r\nThe series continues to be mostly comedic, slowly introducing the different characters and developing their personalities and relationships. It soon develops into a romantic comedy as such relationships blossom, especially between the main characters of Yuuta and Rikka. However, it isn't long after this that the series begins to lose sight of its direction in more ways than one. Let me start off with saying that I am not adverse to drama in romance, in fact most of the time drama is what keeps such a show interesting and worth watching. However, drama can sometimes be handled in a very poor way, and such is the case with Chuunibyou. In the last three episodes of Chuunibyou, the plot and momentum of the show is very poorly done. Bad plot devices, mindnumbing cliches uncharacteristic of the show and characters acting very out of character spoil what once was one of my favourite shows currently airing. I won't go into detail about exactly what I disliked about it, because it would be spoiling, but I will say that KyoAni are trying to take a leaf out of the Jun Maeda book of melodrama, and it just isn't working for them. Not to mention the ending provides no real romantic closure for any of the characters other than Yuuta and Rikka (and even their romantic ending is handled in a way that didn't exactly excite), and little to no explanation of certain things shown after the credits rolled. They could be setting up for a second season, but with a poor ending like that I'm not sure that I'll be watching.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Chuunibyou is still a good show. However, the lack of delicate balance between comedy and romance in the latter portion of the show and poor handling of drama detract from what was a very strong first half. My score would have been higher if it had stayed a pure romantic comedy, or if the concluding episodes had been more satisfying/better handled. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a 7/10, and a recommendation for anyone who enjoys comedy, romance, or perhaps just a little taste of their old adolescent delusions of grandeur.",

            "content": "This is my first time attempting a review, but I decided it was about time to give it a shot. This anime to me was very enjoyable, and I was always eagerly waiting for the next episode to come out, therefore making this anime most likely my favourite of this fall 2012 season.\r\nStory: [8/10]\r\nVery good story, I was disappointed to see how many people dropped the anime after it got serious, as even after the slight bit of drama, the anime plot only progressed and got better. A very emotional story, and I shed a tear or two to some of the scenes, be thetears happy or sad, I'm glad the show managed to get me 'the watcher' to feel the emotion.\\n\\n\r\nArt: [8/10]\\n\r\nLinking to the emotion of the show, the art did very well to show the feeling's of the characters, and made some of the scenes even more powerful. Not to mention the art in general was great, the 'Ethereal Horizon' scenes were incredibly well done and I was taken back by the work put into it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: [8/10]\\n\r\nPersonally, I loved the opening, especially the very start of it with the piano playing. A lovely opening, and also a good ED to go with at the end of every episode is very important. The voice actors, especially Dekomori's actor (Uesaka, Sumire) were brilliant. Some very powerful scenes can often be ruined when the voice actors aren't up to standard, but not the case here. The voices of the characters were great, especially Rikka when she was shy.... CUTE.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: [10/10]\\n\r\nEighth-Grader Syndrome, such a plus when it comes to judging the characters in Chu-2. The personalities of all of the members of the Eastern Napping Society.. in Summer, were so unique and fresh, a real change from the normal Heroines and characters. I also have a personal love the Dark Flame Master.. such a boss.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: [9/10]\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this anime, would really recommend it. Not only has it got comedy, but it includes some drama as well as a very cute Romance between the two main characters. Most likely my favourite anime for this season, and I will definitely have to re-watch this again in the near-future.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: [9/10]\\n\r\nTo sum up, this anime is Great. A class above very good anime (for me anyway) but not a 10/10 masterpiece at the same time. Highly recommended by me, a very loveable anime, it's a true shame that the story can only go on for 12 episode's, but at the same time I think that means a lot more happens in a shorter amount of time. Definitely give this a watch, you should fall in love with at least one of the girls; Nibutani, Dekomori, Kumin or Rikka, personally for me, Rikka is the one. Haha. \\n\\n\r\nBe sure to say if you found this review helpful (or not), I might have gone on a bit but forgive me, it's my first time doing a review. If you want to have a discussion about this anime or a related one that I might have watched then don't be afraid to message or post a comment. Thank's for reading if you got this far. ^_^",

            "content": "Chuunibyou is an odd sort of coming-of-age-esque story. The main ideal hidden behind the anime is that getting older does not mean you have to grow up. This was one of the first anime I watched fully through, including its sequel, and I have yet to find another that has made me feel like Chu-2.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nChuunibyou takes a rather normal story, of a boy and a girl who are more-or-less thrown together to become friends, along with their club members\r\nChuunibyou is about a group of teens who suffer(ed) from Chuunibyou, or 8th Grade Syndrome, which consists of delusions of having special powers and the like.It's a very relatable topic, as most kids have imagined themselves being superpowered world-savers. It takes this basic idea and fleshes it out into a funny, well-written, rom-com anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story mainly follows four main people, 2 girls who have yet to give up their Chuunibyou, and 2 past \"Chuuni's\" who go to great lengths to hide their past embarrassment. They form a club, along with another normal girl, and set out through their high school life.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation is well known for their pretty animation style and, of course , relatively good anime. The veteran studio shows its skill here. While not exceptionally outstanding or groundbreaking, the animation quality throughout the show is quite consistently pretty. The visuals help create different tones when needed, and the movement throughout the anime is fluid and well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the music in the anime is not especially new, or different. The opening and ending are both well done. The background music always fits the tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters in Chu-2 is a wonderful assortment of people. You have the wonderfully cute and strange Rikka, her also cute sidekick Dekomori, the anti-cute, yet beautiful and popular Nibutani, the cute, quiet, sleepy Kumin. Finally, you have the main character, the not-so-clueless, normal teen, Togashi Yuuta. These characters have such believable and relatable backstories, and good motivation. Most importantly, there is such a great chemistry between all the characters, (although not quite as great as Hokago Tea-Time).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI knew I would love this anime from the first episode. I really related to Yuuta, trying to fit in during my early high school days. The irresistibly cute characters, the imaginary fantasy fights, and the high school antics mixed into exactly what I love.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou combined the perfect mix of Slice of Life and romance, along with little speckles of fantasy and drama. Great looking animation, and good sound helped create beautiful scenes with spot on tone to match the witty and fun dialogue and story. The characters all contributed to the story in their own ways, as well as matching each others personalities so well. Chuunibyou is a must see for anyone who enjoys sweet and fun anime.",

            "content": "Chuunibyou is a heart-warming, deceptively tightly paced narrative that succeeds both as a comedy and a drama within a believable context.\r\nThe story of Chuunibyou is centred on Yuuta Togashi, a high school student who has started out at a new school with a fresh opportunity to make friends. In the past, he had few, due to his Chuunibyou (eighth grade syndrome) which left him absorbed in his fantasy world while others laughed at him. However, Rika, his fellow student and fellow resident of his apartment complex, is still suffering from Chuunibyou, leaving Togashi feeling threatened that his past may come crashing down on him. Initially,this story focusses on introducing the audience to the main cast through comedic interactions, which serves both as effective episodic light-hearted enjoyment and lays down the foundation of character motivations and relationships. However, though these episodes are relatively airy, they still have rather dark subtle undertones that occasionally, though not unmistakably, present themselves to the audience. As a result, the more dramatic, emotional second half is flowed into naturally without feeling forced or uncalled for. Over the latter 50% of the series, mysterious characters are illuminated, and character relationships are altered in a rather predictable, though organic and entirely justified, development. On the whole, Chuunibyou\u2019s tight nature works heavily in its favour, though not entirely; some of the side characters\u2019 motivations don\u2019t seem entirely fleshed out, and the series does feel just slightly too short.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Chuunibyou, much more so than the story, are what it is likely to be remembered for. Yuuta Togashi is very relatable (specifically for me, embarrassingly) though doesn\u2019t feel like a shallow place holder. He has, at the beginning, very specific and unambitious goals, so as a character on his own, he isn\u2019t too interesting, though his interactions with Dekomori, Rika and Nibutani more than make up for this. His exasperation towards Dekomori, his growing concern for Rika and his envy and admiration for Nibutani all add character to him, though admittedly Rika\u2019s older sister, Tooka, are the most hilarious. (On a side note, Yuuta also manages to retain likability in spite of the fact that he regularly beats up younger girls and reading women\u2019s magazines.) Rika, the show\u2019s poster character, is memorable, well developed and extremely engaging to watch. The anime succeeds in making her a likable character at the beginning, establishing that she has been the way she is for a very long time, but the best character work is done with her in the second half. \\n\\n\r\nDekomori also has a lot of development, acting as the archetypal good-intentioned, yet nonetheless extremely troublesome and immature, friend. Her character is secondary, though thankfully is addressed in a way that feels sufficient in the context of the story. Nibutani doesn\u2019t have the same level of watchability as the other cast members, though she is also a well-established character who, though changing little over the context of the story, adds a lot to it through her believably wise advice and experience. She strikes a good balance between being mature and kind, while also being stern and serious when the situation requires it. However, she isn\u2019t completely consistent. At the beginning of the story, she seems somewhat self-absorbed and doesn\u2019t listen to the others as much as she should. Though this isn\u2019t bad, her more selfless, kind attitude in the second half doesn\u2019t quite seem to gel with the more juvenile attitude shown earlier. Additionally, her decision to join the club seems more like a device to get her to interact with the rest of the cast, rather than being a justifiable decision of her own. Had the story devoted just a few more minutes to her, she would have felt more complete. Another character who may have benefitted from more time is Tooka, Rika\u2019s older sister. She serves her job well, is a great supporting character who flits naturally between being serious and funny, though her more forceful attitude isn\u2019t quite explained, which could have been helped greatly by showing her with her mother of Rika a little more. Other than these characters, the others are fairly static, though Kumin and Makoto breathe a bit of much needed comic relief into the latter half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of overall aesthetics, Chuunibyou is a high quality production, as is expected from Kyoto Animation. The characters are well-lit and shaded, regardless of the time of day, and the backgrounds are consistently detailed. Everything is lit a little more lightly than it would be in real life, giving the anime a much more youthful and optimistic look that fit well with its themes and characters. Much of this can be attributed to the highly skilled and experienced key animator Masaya Makita, a veteran of Kyoto Animation with a distinct visual style. However, the character designs are a bit lacking in originality because of this; the heavily reflect those from K-ON!, Clannad and Haruhi Suzumiya, particularly in the case of Nibutani. Thankfully, Chuunibyou is extremely light on fan service, which is greatly appreciated given the nature of this series\u2019 tone. The character models are nearly never off, the movements and fluid and each character is given a visual identity through the way in which they move, be it Nibutani\u2019s more upright, respectable stance of Dekomori\u2019s more juvenile, energetic expressions. The highlight of the series would have to be the short, yet very fun and vibrant battle sequences (which, ironically, bear an uncanny resemblance to those if Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (2014)). On the whole, Chuunibyou is great to look at, though isn\u2019t the pinnacle of artistic integrity of originality.\\n\\n\r\nIn the sound department, both the opening and ending are catchy, upbeat, fitting and memorable, which seems to be a running theme throughout this anime. The opening sounds very nice, though the over-choreographed nature of it may have some viewers scratching their heads. The ending is even better, with the cast members contributing their voices to a rather nonsensically written, though still  extremely fun, tune that doesn\u2019t quite feel as in place towards the end of the series. The OST serves its purpose well chiming in to uplift the comedic scenes, though quieting down a little too much during the emotional ones.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the voice acting in the series, both the original Japanese and the Sentai FIlmworks English dub serve their purpose well, though the former does have an edge over the latter. For Yuuta Togashi, the much more experienced and iconic Jun Fukuyama brings much more energy to the role than the otherwise fine Leraldo Anzaldua. The various supporting characters, to varying degrees, manage to retain their essence and seem to understand their characters enough the match up reasonably well to their Japanese counterparts. Rika, however, has been tampered with in a very interesting manner. In the original Japanese, she sounds very down-trodden and pathetic, as is appropriate for her character. In English, however, she has a surprisingly deep voice, which effectively contrasts her age from her very childish and na\u00efve attitude. Both artistic decisions work relatively well, though it may be difficult for one who has already been exposed to one language to view this anime in another language. Ultimately, though, the Japanese edges ahead slightly simply because, being set in high school, the Japanese mannerisms and word plays work much better in the native language. Also, the English script can be too literally translated at time, resulting in unusual sentence structure and confusing puns.\\n\r\nOn the whole, Chuunibyou is a tight series with well-developed characters that is pleasant in sight and sound, memorable, and, in spite of not feeling like the most original story ever told, will likely work for all but the most hardened of viewers.\\n",

Maybe there are some bright moments that share in our maturity than others but, still every moment was sharing in this migration.\r\nI barely remember any watch worthy anime talked about that moment when we turn \"according to our own eyes\" from kids into teenagers, there's an anime makers' obsession about teenagers problems and adults ones, but hey, there's a primary stage to them all, the one when we start to get depressed forthe fist time, that when we first think so deeply about our feelings, that one when we knew we've been dealing with a serious problem here, that one when our heart for the first time took a different tone that made our backbone suffered that cute pure shiver of love.\\n\\n\r\nTo find an anime finally talks about all of this brought back some memories to every watcher I guess or at least for me, nostalgic moments filled my heart while watching this cute moments between those early teenagers that was full of joy and fun, other moments came when they face some problems that we might as adults now think they are nothing to care of, but yes back then they were so huge on our small hearts.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime managed perfectly to make a spot on this age stage that we all have been through in different ways. Thus, I found the story is very interesting and enjoyable, despite that little repeated touch of creating their own club on the Japanese school-genre stories. ^^\\n\\n\r\nThe art was decent to a very acceptable degree, yes there were some flaws of missed shadows and character design similarities but it was simple and very suitable to such a story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters distinguishing is really a strong point of this anime, they are all as innocent and cute as their age but yet they weren't the same even in joking.. the chemistry between the characters was very good you will be able to find the progress in their relationship by their looks, jokes, physical distance from each other.. also the scenario was really lovable I liked how the conversation kept flowing easily,  I didn't sense a single out of area words which is really really rare in shoujo anime series.\\n\\n\r\nYou will totally enjoy the series if you are a comedy-drama fan, it will make you totally in tears of joy, still it will keep you sense a beautiful progress in the plot happening through. \\n\r\nMy overall rate for this anime is by particular a 8.2/10. \\n",

            "content": "Years ago, a powerful being known as the Dark Flame Master roamed the world, using his powers to spread darkness and terror wherever he went. One day he decides that he has had enough of that lifestyle and using his powers, he seals away his abilities and even his memories before vanishing into obscurity.\r\nPicking up from there, Chuunibyo demo Koi ga Shitai tells the story of a young girl, Rikka, wielder of the Tyrant Eye, an artifact of such power that it has to be kept within a seal in case its power should rampage unchecked, as she searches for the Unseen Horizon and hermissing father.\\n\\n\r\nShe is opposed by the evil Administrative Bureau, led by the enigmatic Priestess, who try to suppress the existence of magic and all things fantastic. When she learns of the legend of the Dark Flame Master, Rikka goes undercover as a high school student to try to find him and restore his memories, hoping to enlist his aid against her enemies and find her father. Along the way, she gathers to her side a group of unlikely companions such as Mori Summer, the last mage on Earth, and Dekomori Sanae, wielder of the Mjollnir Hammer.\\n\\n\r\nI found this series to be funny with good action scenes and a heartwarming ending. The comedy comes mainly from the situations Rikka gets into as a powerful magic user who has to pretend to be a bumbling and inept high school girl. There is also a part where the Priestess indoctrinates children which literally had me in tears. The fight scenes are fantastically animated - as can be expected from Kyoto Animation - and reminded me of fights from the Fate series.\\n\\n\r\nOne gripe I had with the series was that character development for the supporting characters was somewhat lacking, but this could be due to the short length of the series. I would have liked to learn more about Mori Summer, Kumin, and Isshiki for example, as I felt that they were rather 2 dimensional characters. I hope that this will be improved on in the second season. The other thing was that the pacing of the series felt a bit... off. For example, around episode 7 the tone shifts very abruptly from light to serious, before going back to being light again.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this series and would recommend it to people who like high school romantic comedies or who are interested in social misanthropy.\\n",

            "content": "There are no spoilers in this review \r\nWell I just finished this series, and I thought it was rather enjoyable. A bit silly at a few points but it really didn't try to hard to do anything so I thought that there isn't anything really wrong with it. \r\nStory \r\nThe story is probably the weakest part of Chu-2, but by no means is it bad. It's well written and well executed but it's not really something which is that special and it's not that cliche either. This simply means it's difficult to predicted whether someone likes it or not. I feel like this is ananime someone will either like or dislike. In the end I really enjoyed it and it was a good story in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nTech \\n\r\nThere are a few minor things which bugs me here. Overall it's well animated but the art style is good but the nose's aren't defined that much, so it looks like that there aren't noses at all sometimes. \\n\r\nThis has always been a sort of pet peeve. But besides this the art is well done. The special effects are good and the sound and sound effects are great. There was a point where some of the background music annoyed me but this is rather trivial. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nI give this anime a high mark for characters. They developed well and all where really interesting. \\n\r\nThe whole Chunibyo concept also made things interesting and I enjoyed the imaginary action battles the characters had when they were in Chunibyo mindset. \\n\r\nThis is probably due to my adolescence Chunibyo stage being allot more mild than the characters one and mine wasn't embarrassing, although I may still be in it. \\n\\n\r\nConculsion \\n\r\nAn light short enjoyable little slice of life which is easy to digest and easy to enjoy. A good anime to watch between seasons of more serous anime.",

I am going to keep this short and too the point, no one wants to be sitting here reading endless rambles (mind you some do) Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is an entertaining ride involving two people Rikka and Yuuta both suffer from Chuunibyou which basically means they like to conjure up random events and be embarrassing to be around. However the main character Yuuta is trying to escape that but is constantly being pulled in by Rikka whosuffers from the syndrome big time. Another issue is that she lives in the flat above his so he has no means of escaping her. \\n\\n\r\nFrom then on we are sent on twists and turns of fun adventures with colourful characters and from my personal view it hit all the right notes of the slice of life/romance genre. The only issue in which I presume most will have is that the love building relationship between Rikka and Yuuta is a very slow one but for me it was still fulfilling. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was great, the sound was great and the dialogue between them was well written and at some points hilarious. I recommend this show to most of you slice of life fans out there because I know you will love Rikka and her amazing personality.",

            "content": "Review:\r\nPersonal Opinions\r\nThis anime was quite hilarious. I became interested on the topic of chuunibyou (aka Eighth Grader Syndrome) after I watched Steins;Gate, and combined with my curiosity on the eye-patch girl who appears quite often on the internet, it led me to watch this anime. I must say that this is one of the better slice-of-life anime I have watched, and as I write this I am watching the sequel. I was planning to write a single review for both of them...but I ended up deciding against that.\r\nAlso, during some of the sadder/slower/romantic parts of the anime I usually felt a bit bored, and Ithink I'll go into more detail in the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nThe story was pretty interesting, although I enjoyed the first half more than the second half, for various reasons. The second half was slower paced, felt melancholy, had a heavy focus on romance between characters, and I found it lacking in the earlier comedy. The romance wasn't bad....but (in my opinion) it wasn't that great either. But more on that in the 'characters' section.\\n\r\nLike lots of slice of life anime, the anime was mostly episodic, while the story's main plot progressed in the background. The last few episodes were when things started to get a bit more into the genre of drama and some heartstrings were being pulled. Now...the last few episodes weren't bad, but, like the romance, not as good as I hoped. I think I was supposed to feel emotional or something, but I only really thought two things: \"You kids are making a biiiiig mistake here!\" and \"I'm kinda bored\". The second half wasn't that bad - I just didn't like it as much as the first half, and I felt the drama was rather sudden, though story-wise it made sense. The problem was that all of the comedy that I absolutely loved about the series kind of died out after the drama hit, and that was something that, I as the viewer, was not ready for. I felt that this was something that hurt the series, and that it was a bit unnecessary. The story ended on a satisfactory note though, so you don't need to worry about that.\\n\r\nSo basically, the story was great in comedy and made me laugh a lot, the romance felt a bit awkward to me, and the last few episodes I was feeling rather frustrated at the characters and what they were doing, but it ended quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nFor the most part the characters were pretty good. I thought the main character, Togashi, was a bit lame honestly, but whenever we got to see his chuunibyou side it was really cool. The female lead, Rikka, was also a bit boring without her chuunibyou personality, but I think it made sense.\\n\r\nThe romance....I felt like they didn't have enough synergy for it to be interesting, and I think their relationship is kind of relationship that siblings would have (excluding the blushing and pinky-holding). The fact that Rikka both looks and acts younger than Togashi doesn't help much either.\\n\r\nMy favourite character was probably the 'Dark Flame Master', but sadly he had a exceedingly short amount of screen time. ):\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nLove, Chuunibyou and Other Delusions offers some pretty nice art for the most part. Of course, money-saving tactics are present, but there have been a few interesting scenes where someone in the background is moving around in which otherwise would've been a still picture. I thought that made it a bit more interesting, and it shows that they didn't just drop a still picture scene in the middle of the anime.\\n\r\nSomething on the more shocking side of things, the battle animation actually looks really cool. Yes, BATTLE ANIMATION. IN A SLICE OF LIFE ANIME.\\n\r\nPerhaps my only complaint is that the characters were all drawn to look so young. I couldn't take the romance seriously because their faces are soo child-like!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nNo complaints here, but nothing particularly caught my attention. The OP and ED were pretty nice, and fit the anime pretty well. Same with the soundtracks.\\n\r\nI really liked the voice actor for 'Dark Flame Master'. It was really cool.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nFinal Notes:\\n\r\nIt was a pretty nice anime, and I would say that it was worth my time, just because of the chuunibyou. I really like chuunibyou stuff now after watching Steins;Gate and this anime....If only I had the guts to scream \"BANISHMENT, THIS WORLD\" for my whole school to hear!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 7/10",

            "content": "\"Are you familiar with the word, 'chuunibyou'? It refers to a frightening yet charming 'disease' the second year middle schoolers are said to catch... they tend to adopt stranger mannerisms.\"\r\nI think that if people were to look back at the past when they were a child, with all the pretend-games they played, the roleplaying as their favorite superhero, and they hyperactive way in they acted, they would blush in embarrassment and try to throw away all thoughts in the matter. At some time we grew up and integrated to society's demands and social expectations, and shook out head at the way we acted as akid. But deep down, I believe we all have a sense of nostalgia and loneliness, some kind of ambivalent feeling to go back to simpler times where we wouldn't be shunned for our spontaneity. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the beautiful theme presented in Chuunibyou. It goes through the eyes of the protagonists Togashi Yuuta, a boy entering his high school years who wishes to do away with his past as a middle schooler that liked to pretend he was a \"Dark Flame Master\" and scared away his classmates. He meets a girl, Takanashi Rikka, who is a chuunibyou but has yet to throw away her delusions and imagination.The story begins with their meeting and follows the two as the deepen their friendship, and in doing so, seeing the different viewpoints held by the two. Yuuta's rejection of his past, Rikka's rejection of reality, the interaction woven between these two form the theme of Chuunibyou.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it is done well. One of the biggest problems in any form of media is that they tend to throw their theme or lesson at your face, and tries to force you to adhere to it. It tends to become annoying, to the point where you want to slap your monitor. What Chuunibyou does is not directly tell you which is good or bad, but presents the theme through the interactions of the characters and allow you to form your thoughts on the subject without being pretentious. When the drama begins, it does not feel forced nor contrived, but goes naturally. The magic of this show is that it amazingly manages to put together comedy and drama together, without giving the sense of awkwardness when the setting flows between the two. You can be laughing at the silliness of Rikka at one scene, then feel a hint of sadness at another when you realize she isn't just a delusional happy girl, and has problems of her own that comes with her choice to stay as a chuuni. It does say much when your slice of life typical beach episode fills you with laughter and joy that you would expect, then manages to make you feel the opposite feelings minutes later.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme aside, the animation in this show is beautiful. Kyoani seems to have a budget that could allow them to purchase nuclear warheads, and most of it is spent on the animation. The characters move brilliantly and so much detail is put on their body language, gestures, and reactions. Take a moment to look at the background and you can see there will always be something move or taking place. It becomes almost baffling at the small things Kyoani decides to animate as the show moves on, and for me, it is vastly appreciated. And when the \"magical fight\" scenes begin you are rewarded with a beautiful orgy of colors, vibrancy, and life. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound quality is amazing as well and no lack of effort is seen throughout. The sound effects are all wonderfully done, the music is extremely catching and flows together with the scene you are watching to tug on your emotions, and you can't seriously tell me hearing a regular high school student, then hearing Lelouch Lamperouge isn't amazing. However, don't let Fukuyama Jun fool you in to believing the other cast does an amazing role as well.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some problems with the show. Initially, it may seem that Chuunibyou doesn't take the matter of being a high-school student delusional delinquent seriously, mainly because Rikka is allowed to get away with her antics without much consequence. But as the show goes on it does begin to present some of the problems; it just takes a few episodes to delve into it. At times the episodes also seem formulaic, and some of the jokers on the show are overdone. It also does pander to the audience with its cuteness and hyperactive characters.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, if you can cast aside these few problems, you are presented with a overall enjoyable show that portrays its theme wonderfully, gives you high-quality animation and sound, a cast of funny well-developed characters, all of which tug at your emotions. Unless you are a true hater of Kyoto Animation and what it stands for, I would recommend this show.   \\n\\n",

            "content": "(There's a couple of minor spoilers in this review, you've been warned)\r\nGrowing up is not that easy, when we were in middle school, we did embarassing things and through growing up we wanted to forget them badly, hell we would erase it if we could. This show revolves around that, except it calls it a 'eighth grade symptom' or as easily known, 'chuunibyou'. Smart eh? We go through the adventure of 2 characters, one that suffered from chuunibyou and one thats still experiencing it, how will this duo go out?\r\nStory: 7.3/10\r\nI told you the story in my introduction so lets cut to the chase, thisidea is simple and origina;, a reason this show got popular, simple is good, I like the idea of this. The story also centers around other characters, but these characters are there to add comedy to the show, mainly for the first 6 episodes, after that they're there to help out this duo. Its a good use of characters and makes them seem useful.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nI like the art here, its nice and really well done. The backgrounds are good looking and at times can be beautiful and filled with colours, the world around chuunibyou is like if its the real world, its normal to the brim.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe music is well done here, the OP is catchy while the ED is good to listen to. The background music really fits the style of the show and gives it more of a realistic feeling.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:8/10\\n\r\nYuuta: Yuuta is a normal high school boy with a past thats embarrasing to him, he wants to erase it and leave it all behind, as soon as he meets our main heroine, she always tries to get him to go back to his past-self. Fun fact, the same actor who voiced Lelouch from Code  Geass voiced this character, how ironic. Yuuta is easily a likable character and feels like a real person.\\n\\n\r\nRikka: Rikka is suffering chuunibyou and usually drives Yuuta crazy, this drives do some decent comedy which is well apreciated here. We later find out she has a pretty dark past which makes her chuunibyou seem more understandable, goddamn smart. Also she's cute, especially the sound she makes when she gets hit, SO CUUUTE!\\n\\n\r\nThe developement between Yuuta and Rikka is so damn well done, it feels so realistic and is some of the best developements I've seen in a show, this duo works so well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThis show should suck you in with its fun cast, filled with likable characters, there's not a single character I hate in this show. The comedy is used pretty well for the most part, you should expect a few laughs and chuckles here and there throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10\\n\r\nI can't help but enjoy this show, its something really well done and the creators should damn know that. The ending is beautiful and will leave you in tears, this show is not afraid to shoot you with the feel-rifle. Overall, I reccomend Love, Chuunibyou and Other Delusions to anyone looking for a solid and heartwarming comedy with a bit of romance. Hell the name of the show itself \"Love, Chuunibyou and Other Delusions\" sums up the show in a nutshell, it literally tells you what to expect from this show. How ironic.",

It's nothing complicated. As a slice-of-life genre, this doesn't require extensive research. An average plot for an average anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nUsual Kyo-ani stuff, the art is vivid and colorful. Detailed and lively, it definitely catches the eye of the viewer. The animation itself is pretty well done as the \"make-believe\" fights are fluid and fast paced. However, I only graded this \"8\" because the drawings of the character are your usual, generic moe, which is not really my cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nNothing special to mention, average op and ed song and are not unique in any way\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThis is the anime's strong point. The characters themselves are the solid foundation of the plot. Yuuta, who is trying to forget about his past and Rikka, who, unfortunately, keeps reminding him of his past, is a perfect blend of contrast and some of the scene where they are together are quite funny, Dekomori is a cheerful girl who is also affected by the 8th grader syndrome and Nibutani, an ojou-sama type of girl who's true character would be later revealed, everyone kept on their role strongly and are probably memorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nNow this is the downfall of the anime. It failed to keep me hooked and I was already tempted to drop it out of boredom. Most of the humor are bland and corny that they fail to make me laugh and there are several unnecessary scenes in the anime that they should've cut. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Chuunibyo demo koi ga shitai is an average school life anime. If you're into slice-of-life with romance-comedy and not-so complicated story, then this is definitely for you. However, this is just one of the anime that I will quickly forget in the future (of course this opinion is entitled to me, but others are welcome to share in). Wow, I just said that I would keep this quick and short but I actually wrote a moderately long one. Now, if you would let me enjoy my pizza",

Also the inclusion of Kumin and Isshiki was meaningless as both of them practically do nothing over the whole anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Kyo Ani strikes again,a visual masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nSound: not among the best.but really effective during the more serious parts.\\n\\n\r\n                           What really made Chunnibyou great was its character interaction.visual beauty and depiction of comedy.During the second half,the comedy part fell a tad,and more melodramatic aspects were involved.However,the romance between Yuuta and Rikka was really great to watch,as well as the serious plots when the anime goes deep into Rikka's past. And this is Chunnibyou's greatest credit,that despite its moe and cliche elements..it still manages to stand out than most other romance anime due to the good presentation of the serious moments.\\n\r\n                           Overall,Chuu2-byo has its flaws,but it still is very enjoyable to watch and definately stands as one of the best of 2012.\\n",

            "content": "Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is yet another masterpiece from KyoAni. Probably not a surprise to those who have been fans of the studio for all these years. Still, it's always great to see KyoAni shine when they make the best of the best (most of the time).\r\nThe tale here is quite beautiful. It follows Yuuta and Rikka. Yuuta is a boy that is trying to leave his past of chuunibyou (childish delusional behavior) behind, while Rikka is in the middle of it. As the series goes along, each characters past is explored in different ways. Of course, these memories pave the way for thefuture of the series as well. It's quite cute and harmless, like most of KyoAni's past work. There is a nice blend of romance, comedy, and drama in the series, which makes it all that more delightful. \\n\\n\r\nKyoAni pretty much always hits a home run in the art department. Here, it is no different. Every scene is wonderful to look at, especially during the \"fight\" scenes. Whenever the show transports characters to the world that they see themselves in, for battles, it is mind blowing. Definitely some of the best animation I've seen in quite sometime. Again, this isn't a surprise. It's KyoAni. They always deliver.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is both hyper (at times) and soft. Every piece fits the scene that they are played over. The OP is wonderful too. It's energetic and feels like you're entering a land of adventure and fun. ED is okay. Nothing too special.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are fantastic. Yuuta is quite an interesting character. Through the series, he grows tremendously. While he does learn a lot about Rikka and her past, he also gains knowledge about himself as well. It's great seeing how much his character evolves in the series. As said before, Rikka evolves just as much as Yuuta, if not more. Her past, wants, and desires are drizzled through each episode. By the end, her character is fleshed out in a way that is truly satisfying. \\n\\n\r\nSome other characters include Sanae and Shinka, who are part of the club that Yuuta and Rikka are in. They provide some great laughs. At the same time, some of the standout moments in the anime revolve around their interactions with Yuuta and Rikka. To be honest, now that I think of it, there were never any characters that I didn't enjoy seeing on screen. Everyone provided comedy gold and also added to the, already touching, story of Rikka. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is an amazing anime. I know I used this word before, but I have to say it again. The word to define this show is cute. Everything about it is cute. The humor, the drama, the characters, the setting, and even the darker moments are cute. But I don't mean that in a bad way. This is a show that deals with growing up and what it means to become older as the years go by. It's about what you choose to leave behind and what you choose to stay with you as time ticks away. It's about friendship, family, love, loss, life, and being kind to others. This is the type of show I love watching. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",

            "content": "When I looked at the Fall 2012 anime series line up I immediately threw this anime onto the 'do not watch' list. When I see Moe girls and Comedy on genres or themes I assume there is little to no story. But of course I was bored like anyone else so I went to watch this anime for the laughs. The first half of the series was lighthearted comedy but it actually has a story comes the latter half. The twist was a nice touch. The ending was okay for the most part but it left a void for me. \r\nKyoto animations does a greatjob with Chuunibyo. Characters move fluidly and seamlessly. Character designs are great; Seifuku is the most important clothing in an anime but KyoAni did not forget about daily clothing either. Nearly half of the anime was taken outside of school hours so I applaud them for designing normal wear. Scenery was a big thing for me in this anime. The scenery was always appropriate with the atmosphere. And lighting was perfect, it was weaker at times and when things got more intense Darker Light and Highlights were enhanced to strengthen the mood. The animation was not over ambitious when it did not need to be and was astounding when it was.\\n\\n\r\nI would have to say the Opener and the Closer are the weakest point for sound in this anime. While they are nice sounding the vocals are a bit squeaky. The music accompanies the atmosphere very well in all scenarios of the anime. But outside of the anime there are only a few good listens. I found the voice acting to be superb in this anime. It has been a while since I've heard Jun Fukuyama play a proper role. And Maaya Uchida scores gold on my list thanks to her perfect portrayal of Rikka. \\n\\n\r\nThe main characters Yuuta and Rikka both get plenty of character development and are always involved with the story. The two characters as a whole have one of the best relationships I've seen in anime history. The supporting characters play their roles nicely and appear in the story at the perfect times. \\n\\n\r\nI gave it a 10. \\n\\n\r\nI love their Romance. I like Kyoto Animations. I love Yuugure To Yorisou Kanjou. I like Nibutani. I loved this Anime. I like it at 9.",

In this anime, the story tells about a boy which had cured fromChuunibyou and then he met a girl which have a serious chuunibyou problem, is that it? nope, The story will tell us the behind why their acted like that (Chuunibyou) and of course the relationsip between them.\\n\\n\r\nAs for me, its kinda unique one, They bring a new fresh romance anime. Their love growth gradually, not like the other anime which usually the love start from the first they're meet. Its not something like that, love is something that grows naturally,  they cant just happen in just one meet. and so i totally agree with the love perspective in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n*spoiler start*\\n\r\nif you're looking a kissing scene, then maybe it will disappoint you. but i am sorry to say that will not happen\\n\r\n*spoiler end*\\n\\n\r\nas suspected from KyoAni, they rarely put any kissing scenes in their anime though i must admit, without it, the \"romance feeling\" can still be felt. even, the romance feeling was much more stronger.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART and CHARACTER\\n\r\nHow about the art? if you have saw K-on, then maybe this anime will remembering you, the cuteness from each character are really visible. you cant help to falling in love with each character, not just from the face aspects but the behavior that they did was so.... MOE! \\n\\n\r\nThe art itself was really fits with the character, while the character was described to be cute (from the behavior or acts). the art itself represent the message of \"cute\", big eyes, cute face, or fascinating smile. and its totally all the message will be received by the viewer, thats what i think.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, i was so surprise even in just 12 episode they really made each character have a \"fair appearance\" and have their own uniqueness, also none of the characters are not useful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nNo doubtly, the sound was absolutely brilliant too. The OP \"Sparkling Daydream\" by ZAQ was so catchy, i couldnt pass/skip the OP. its just so epic. and even the Ending song too, \"inside identity\" if i didnt wrong. it really represents on what happen in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nNot just the OP and the ED itself, the seiyuu voice must we appreciate too. when it comes to the last episode,their feelings  through the sound really can be felt. the sadness, the happiness, i couldnt help myself to shed my tears when i hear Rikka's cry, its just so sad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nas for now, this romance anime is some of the anime that can shed my tears (though i must hidden it from my mother, lol). The atmosphere that they (Chuunibyou) created was so easy to understand, not too complicated but its not to simple too. and one message for me after i watching this is,\\n\\n\r\n\"Just be yourself, and act what really makes you comfortable\"",

            "content": "A broken little girl drags into her fantasy/shonen delusions a nebbish who apparently had similar deusions; he helps fix her as he falls in love with her and learns life lessons. Standard enough summary for a highschool romance-comedy: it sounds like a storyline that could've come out of a Key production like _Clannad_ or _Kanon_ without much modification.\nThe animation is pleasant enough in the standard Kyoani template; the sound is entirely forgettable.\nCharacter highlights for me included the protagonist Yuuta not being a blank slate dating sim protagonist but having his own delusive past and acting appropriately; the beautiful but two-faced Nibutani (an archetype one mayremember from _Toradora_'s Ami or _Haruhi_'s Asakura); the protagonist buddy being actually a decent guy and not a knave or buffoon; the sidekick is a prodigy rich girl, a type we don't see that often (only example that comes to mind is in _Azumanga Daioh_); and in particular, Rikka's older sister Touka is great, a strong female character with her own career who is unafraid to blackmail Yuuta with some interesting moves of her own, and I found particularly hilarious the running gag of Touka &amp; Yumeha playing a 'realistic' game of house.\\n\\n\nThe plot moves forward on predictable rails (the first meeting, forming a club, gathering the members) to the climax of coming to grips with Rikka's issues and then the declarations of love ('first girl always wins', as the saying goes), and is good as far as it goes, especially in painfully evoking the ridiculousness of the play-acting - I never did anything like that but still winced in pain at some points. (After a while, I did wish that the battle animations would be more varied. Talk about recyling! It's only 12 episodes, guys...)\\n\\n\nMy beef is more with the ending: after convincing Rikka to give up the chuunibyou and dissolve the club, the plot takes the tragicly obvious route of Nibutani pointing out that a lot of things can be seen as chuunibyou, Yuuta then realizing how that renunciation was a horrible mistake and how delusions make life worth living etc, and having realized his mistake, he then goes to rescue Rikka with the assistance of the club members. Good End.\\n\\n\nI disagree, completely. A question Hideaki Anno asked once comes up again:\\n\\n\n&gt; \"I wonder if a person over the age of twenty who likes robot anime is really happy? He could find greater happiness elsewhere. Regrettably, I have my doubts about his happiness.\"\\n\\n\nNibutani points out that the acting club's president could be seen as suffering chuunibyou. Yes, if you define chuunibyou as simply a passionate interest, many highschoolers or adults suffer it. But this definition 'has all the advantages of theft over honest toil': people do not see chuunibyou as the same as a passion or interest. Why? Because passions are directed toward a real object, they aim at real ends, one can grow, there is objective subject matter to master, and they give genuine rewards and satisfaction. A chuunibyou like Rikka's offers none of these: the subject matter is made up on whim, is artistically impoverished and repetitive, is not transferrable to others (everyone has their own chuunibyou or variants on another's, even Dekomori differs from Rikka, via her Mabinogion), has no depth that the person has not put in themselves, can mutate on the spur of the moment, and is fundamentally unsatisfactory - even as a psychological defense mechanism, it is no substitute for genuinely dealing with the issues.\\n\\n\nYuuta et al say that it's fine to not be too self-conscious and to pursue one's dreams and passions. I agree. Not having a dream or passion is a terrible thing: a sense of meaning can make even the unhappiest life worth living. And so I don't mind Yuuta seeking to give Rikka a dream after destroying her pale chuunibyou dreams. But while the solution to bad dreams is clearly not no dreams at all, it also *is not more bad dreams*! It is *better* dreams. It is a dream like the dream of the acting club's president: a real dream, one that could be attained, that can lead one to more goals and growth, and to surmount additional obstacles.\\n\\n\n&gt; \"Life affords no higher pleasure than that of surmounting difficulties, passing from one step of success to another, forming new wishes and seeing them gratified.\"\\n\\n\nWhat _Chuunibyou_ *should* have shown us is Rikka developing a new dream: perhaps acting, perhaps fencing, perhaps fiction-writing... Many possibilities. Instead, we got a revival of her old crap, whose only saving grace is that we can choose to interpret it as a mix of romantic and a final resolution of her psychological problems which uses the vocabulary of her chuunibyou.\\n\\n\nAn echo of this false dichotomy, this failure to come up with the genuinely healthy outcome, appears in the final beach scene. Rikka, still dreamless, says that the lights are merely electrical lights. This is apparently supposed to indicate the depths of her despair: mere electrical headlights! A stellar example of failing to take joy in the merely real.\\n\\n\nJust some electrical lights? No, they're not 'just' some lights! They're the legacy of a man who night after night in the darkness labored because he knew the world could be better one day; they're the greatest accomplishment of a man who had discovered a thousand ways to not build a light bulb; they're a sign of a new world, a world so busy that it cannot stop simply because the sun has set; they're a technology that has spread everywhere that humans have spread and clustered in their hives of light, so closely tied to En*light*enment that you can mark the extent of suffering and misery by simply at night looking where electrical lights are *not* (by satellite - and are not satellites themselves something far absurder and more extraordinary than anything you have read in a novel? something which *keeps falling yet stays up*; even novels try to avoid self-contradiction); they're a symbol of what Japan was missing out on as it slept away the enturies under the Tokugawa; they're the expression of human cooperation and building, an intricate network of components built across the world, powered by a country's nervous system that at every millisecond, faster than human thought, is being finetuned by distant workers to serve you (and save on men wearily going from gaslight to gaslight, lighting them and dousing them every night and day); they're part of what makes cities work at all, hindering the work of thieves and assisting the police; they're the new reality that reading need no longer be snatched in tiny increments in the daylight in between work in the fields, but absorbed at leisure when necessary, so ordinary people can learn things that our ancestors could never dream of, Horatio; they're why we know so much about so many things, but not how to make a smoky indoors fire so we can see just a little by at night (and poison our lungs, and poison our children). The electric lights are economic wealth, the lights are knowledge, the lights are safety.\\n\\n\nI am reminded, oddly enough, of a bit from a _Haruhi_ fanfiction I read a while ago:\\n\\n\n&gt; \"Of late, the teachers are really starting to drill us for entrance exams, and that's fine. That's expected, even, but it feels like it's not enough. I don't want to keep a list of the top ten facts about the Meiji Restoration on the back of my hand. Tell me that it was something big and important \u2014 that when Tokugawa stepped down and ended the shogunate for good, it was a sign. Japan would never be the same again. Japan would never be able to keep to itself again. It changed the way we live, and you can see that every day. Whenever you buy a pair of headphones that say _Sony_ on the side or a car with a three-diamond ornament on the front, you see something that goes back to that time, that wouldn't exist without that change in how we live our lives.\\n\n&gt; I've watched all our classmates scribble down notes furiously. I wonder sometimes if they ever thought to do more than just copy, copy, and copy some more.\"\\n\\n\nIn comparison to reality, stories about Dark Flame Masters or Tyrant's Eyes come off as exactly what they seem: shallow, childish, ignorant, and unsatisfying. That Rikka or the author cannot see this unseen world all around her is the real tragedy.",

            "content": "So in preparation for the second season of this anime during Winter 2014, I watched this... \r\nLet me get straight to it.  First, it looks really beautiful as excepted from Kyoto Animation, the art style is in my opinion a reason alone to get hooked into watching it.  If you go into anime with the rigid and sole expectations of moderate action, you should just find something else.  Though the fighting scenes are pretty spectacular their relation to the particular plot just offsets their intensity, nevertheless they're a nice treat to see from time to time in the series.  With thecharacters, the main male role was nothing too unique, but his personality definitely complemented the main female role.  All the characters are still great though, and are hilarious at times, but at the same time intrigue you, and most of them all actually developed a fair amount.  The story doesn't really progress until half way, but that's not bad at all.  It really lays the foundation of the characters and the setting and manages to keep your entertained.  The romance doesn't get too far, but that helps it keep its comedic and light hearted vibe.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall if you like slice of life, comedy, and just want to feel good, definitely give this anime a try.  It's not something for people who are hardcore with story development, but its something I really enjoyed watching with all the laughs I had and all the times I felt happy and sad, though happy most of time.",

            "content": "This is a romance series revolving around a girl who lives in a pretend world where she`s the centre of a crazy sci-fi fantasy novel/game (or something).  I read the synopsis for this series and immediately concluded that it was a rip off of Denpa Ono (where the main girl acts like an alien).  That wasn\u2019t going to stop me from watching it, however, because, as we all know, all Kyoto Animation series must be watched by everyone on the internet no matter what.  \r\nThe anime gets my endorsement. I liken it to a youtube video I saw the other day whereanold man made a fancy flower out of some cotton candy.  I\u2019d say the nice people at Kyoani made a masterpiece out of cotton candy on this one.  It has all the mush, fluff and sugariness of your usual late night romantic comedy show with about a zillion times the polish and an actual theme that-- is an actual theme and not just a plot device to give the bs in the anime a reason for being there.  I\u2019ll get back to that later. \\n\\n\r\nThe best way to go through this is probably just to list what I liked and what I disliked.\\n\\n\r\nThing I liked #1 \u2013 Aesthetics: Forget what your mom told you to make you feel better. Looks are important.   If some second rate basement studio made this series, it would not be anywhere near as fun as it is, nor would it have the emotional impact. For example, the corny fantasy fight scenes in this series rival and often exceed what you get on the big name shounen series.  Even subtle things like details in the background are done really well and make the experience really immersive.  \\n\\n\r\nThing I liked #2 \u2013 Macro Plot: You can look at me and say the plot isn\u2019t that original.  Denpa Ona had the same plot, didn\u2019t it? You saw quirky/spaced out chicks in may be 9432% of the harem anime you shamefully consumed over the years.   I shrug my shoulders to you.  The fact that the male lead has a history similar to that of the female lead was enough to get me slightly intrigued. I also thought that, as outlandish as the character`s fantasies are, they do feel like something that I would\u2019ve actually done myself or would\u2019ve seen in real life with gothy kids in high school (however, maybe not taken to the extremes that characters in this show take it to).  In my teenage years, I used to come across kids who thought they could cast spells and do witch magic (no BS). It\u2019s not that far off. \\n\\n\r\nThing I liked #3 \u2013 Cuteness/Comedy: Well it is a romantic comedy so it should deliver laughs and aawwws and it did.  The jokes weren\u2019t especially original but I think the enhanced production values gave certain jokes more punch from the visual wow factor.  For example, in the very first episode the main character bounces around a room and knocks down a bunch of cabinets.  That\u2019s not that great of a joke but it looked so cool in the series.  For romance, it did a lot better job.  The romantic scenes in this anime are relentlessly cute; it\u2019s probably cuter than anything I can remember.  \\n\\n\r\nThing I kinda liked #4 \u2013 Theme: Now I don\u2019t want to get all spoilerific but it\u2019s not much for me to say that a this show has some sort of existentialist theme where it tries to tell you that you can make your own reality.  I found that it did this really well in conveying this theme but I\u2019m not sure if it was really explored to the extent that it could have been. I think you really get the pros and cons of living like Rikka mapped out and where the show finally goes with this theme at the end is actually somewhat bold for a show like this.  I can't really get into it without spoilers though. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I commend the anime for is the fact that it convinced me that it had a sincere purpose and that the creator of the story actually concocted this story based around that As much as this is a cutesy romcom (and that is what it is 97% of the time), I never got the feeling that I get with so many other anime that it\u2019s just the same old romantic comedy in a different situation just so they could make a different show out of it or so that the situation could be a plot device for zany, cutesy things to happen.  The situation here IS a plot device that allows numerous zany cutesy things to happen but it\u2019s more than that.  That\u2019s good. \\n\\n\r\nThing I\u2019m kinda ehhhhhhhhhh on #5\u2013 Characters: There were some good characters and some bad characters.  The female lead character, Rikka, was cute but I didn\u2019t really feel attached to her even though they do a good job of telling you her history.  Conversely, I didn\u2019t get a lot about the main male character\u2019s history like I thought I would near the beginning of the show. The main girl\u2019s sister and the popular girl\u2019s characters are also done with some nice depth.  Unfortunately, all the other characters seem shallow/one dimensional and the reasons they are what they are go under-explained.  I especially didn\u2019t like that the pigtailed bratty girl is such a regular pigtailed bratty girl anime character. \\n\\n\r\nThing I didn\u2019t like much #6 \u2013 Ending: Can\u2019t spoil the ending but I had two problems with it.  Firstly, it wasn\u2019t paced very well and could\u2019ve been crafted better. Maybe they could have split it into two episodes.  Second, the reveal at the end is so lame and unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I liked way more things that I disliked so I give it an 8/10.  To refer back to my lame metaphor. I feel like they took the sugary romance material but still managed to shape it into a legitimate piece about having the freedom to use our imagination to cope with the world. \\n",

            "content": "Review out of 100. 35 for Story, 35 for Characters, 15 for Sound, and 15 for Animation. \r\nStory: (27/35) Really good first half, second half bogged down by a little too much drama.\r\nCharacters: (28/35) Overall entertaining. You'll like them, but you probably wont love them (well, maybe Rikka). \r\nSound: (12/15) Good Opening and Ending, a tad above average everywhere else. \r\nAnimation: (13/15) Pretty High, very good fight scenes, nothing special in the character designs department. \r\nI'd be lying to you if I said I didn't have things in my past that I regret doing, especially in middle school. If we were allowed to go backin time and change it, most of us would, and we would change a lot. Yutta, the main character, is in that situation. He never made friends in middle school because of his Chuunibyou, or 8th Grade Syndrome. Now a first year in highschool, he wants to change all that by being a normal kid. Of course, that doesn't really work out for him. The story of Chuunibyou is a pretty simple one, in that it is your everyday slice of life mixed in with some weird, but funny characters. There are also some pretty kickass fight scenes. Anyway, the first half of Chuunibyou is really good, being a really enjoyable slice of life with a hint of romance and action sprinkled on top. Sadly, the second half adds something to it, drama. I'll admit the drama didn't bug me that much as it isn't as bad as I was expecting, but I'll be damned if it wasn't a little cheesy. The show got too serious for its own good IMO. Thankfully the show had a pretty good ending which made up for this, but the show would have been better if it were less serious. (27/35)\\n\\n\r\nThere weren't any \"bad\" characters in Chuunibyou. Some were better than others, and Yutta wasn't the most interesting main character ever, but they all brought something to the show in a good way. The characters work very well together and are entertaining to watch. It isn't full of character development or anything (well, aside from Rikka), but in the end you will be satisfied with how all the characters ended up. (29/35) \\n\\n\r\nBeing a Kyoto Ani show, the production values are fairly high in this show. You won't go away very impressed with the soundtrack though. It was fairly average, if not a little above average, and both the opening and the ending songs are very good. (12/15) The animation is also very good, especially the fight scenes. You would think you were watching a full on action show since they were so good, even though it's only a slice of life. (13/15)\\n\\n\r\nIf you just want to see a pretty good, original slice of life show that'll bring back some embarrassing memories from you younger days, I suggest you watch this show. The second half isn't as good as the first with all the drama spread everywhere, and get progressively worse up until the last episode (which was pretty good). It sort of redeems itself with a pretty good ending though. You might not fall in love with the entire cast, but I'll be damned if you didn't find them entertaining at all. There are some pretty fun moments to be had overall. (81/100)",

            "content": "This anime is quite frankly one of the best I've ever watched. \r\nI didn't feel that way at first, but its one of those anime that I have now watched over and over for months on end, and every time I watch it, its just like watching it the first time. \r\nORIGINALLY when I watched this the first time... it was embarrassing. Yes sadly, I was Chunibyo back then too. which made it kind of uncomfortable at times. And I thought it was just good. but every time I watched it I kept loving it more and more. \r\nThere are so many little things inthis in the art design and animation that are so perfect. The girls move like real girls, and different girls with different body types.... their bodies are like... real girls in shape, not the normal exaggerated anime style. \\n\\n\r\nBut that wasn't all, the music in this so perfectly fits the mood, in each stage. Yes I've had a girlfriend much like Rikka before, and those little adorable movements she makes especially when she finally figures out she's in love with Togashi are priceless... but real. \\n\\n\r\nMy little \"Rikka\"... was so bashful she could barely squeak out her name to me when I first met her. And to watch Rikka's little reactions were like a little memory trip from long ago. Yes she was a little dreamer too. \\n\\n\r\nBut every character in this has this weapons grade adorableness from Dekomori's craziness to Nibutani's obsessive \"Mori Summer\" reactions, to Kumin's cute innocence and voice. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the interactions between all these characters is just priceless. I don't think there's much in this one I don't like. Even Toka who is kind of a bitch is still hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nI think the only other series I could rate this high that I've seen would be Toradora and Mayo Chiki. \\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough I prefer the DUB version of this to the SUB, the voices for the dub were superior. Which was the complete opposite of Mayo Chiki where I felt the SUB voices were much better and more fitting than the DUB. So they can be hit or miss, but in this case, I would recommend the Dub.",

            "content": "Shrouded in a mist of nonsensical fantasy; there does lye a plethora of deep, meaningful values in this deceivingly juvenile-looking anime.\r\nChuunibyou is a depiction of the emotional battles, and more appropriately: phases that we all go through in life. It's a show that questions the conventional definition of maturity, its relevance, and whether or not anyone can actually mature and leave their child-self behind them completely. \r\nWe always see the product of our childish imaginations to be embarrassing, something to be dismissed, something irrelevant. Certainly this is the case for our main character Yuuta, whose delusions never cease to haunt him.\r\n\"So what?\" you think, asyou may just accept Chuunibyou to be a unique anime, that drives solely on these simple concepts. For this however you would be wrong, as the anime cleverly utilizes a two-faced nature to dive vividly into the emotional journey and the emotional growth particularly of the main heroine: Rikka.\\n\\n\r\nThe sentimentality, fine details, relatable premise, and fluent SoL presentation techniques in Chuunibyou make in an inescapably charming anime. It is a show based on escapism, that will connect a large audience to a plight that forever rages on in our minds. Chuunibyou protests the conventional viewpoint that adults are defined by those mature enough to leave trivial thoughts behind them, and brings about their relevance, their part in the nonsensical journey that is life.\\n\\n\r\nWith Chuunibyou, i came to appreciate the way i thought that i knew everything after two episodes, only to have the show gradually blossom into a much more accurate representation of adolescence - the painful time of transitioning between two ways of thinking, as this is what the entirety of the show is dedicated to conveying. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, it does this well, as for a short series, both its story and character development are formidable. The artwork more-so, but the sound too gives Chuunnibyou a powerful presentation style, that to an extent is able to take you on an emotional journey between laughter and sadness. Much alike the emotional journeys our main characters face.    \\n\\n\r\nI feel like i had been waiting for a show such as Chuunibyou to come along, conveying the sense of struggle involved in maturing; and while its length is self-limitting, therefore the vividness isn't completely fulfilling (though there is a second season)...  Chuunibyou is a unique, charming, escapist piece, that would likely be appreciated by any and all anime fans...",

            "content": "Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai is a twelve episode anime that has a hard time figuring out what it wants to be until about halfway through. The initial half of the show is uninteresting and generic while the last half is touching and romantic. It\u2019s the kind of show I started off making fun of and hating completely, an obvious three or four out of ten. But past that initial slump, it manages to be an entertaining and sad romance that satiates the thirst for decency you\u2019ll want after the first six episodes.\r\nThe generic start to the plot is probably the most painful part ofthe anime. A mysterious girl shows up in front of main male character Yuuta. Yuuta is the generic character of all romance related anime. He\u2019s got one strange quirk and is otherwise cardboard. That quirk is he just got over a case of eighth-grade syndrome, which is when you become engulfed in delusions. He believed himself to be the Dark Flame Master and owned swords and guns and rolled around pretending to fight evil.\\n\\n\r\nThe girl shows up once, then disappears, then reappears in his high school class. She is just like the Yuuta from a few months before as she\u2019s completely delusional and believes herself to possess the Tyrant\u2019s Eye. She sees things differently from Yuuta, she sees the world as a magical place and when having silly fights with friends, they turn into epic battles in her mind. She\u2019s totally delusional beyond anything. She even wears an eyepatch and has a yellow contact so she can pretend to have this special eye.\\n\\n\r\nYuuta gets wrapped up with her and meets a few friends along the way. Nibutani is the class representative and a really pretty girl who Yuuta has a thing for. She becomes a cheerleader and seems like a totally normal girl until she joins the club Yuuta creates to search for a Horizon, some mythical, magical place. Then she turns out to be just like everyone else having had an eighth grade syndrome where she blogged about being a powerful mage.\\n\\n\r\nKumin is an older girl who joins the club to nap. She\u2019s not really that exciting, nor memorable.\\n\\n\r\nMakoto is that stupid, silly friend that all main characters in all romance anime have to have. He\u2019s in love with Kumin.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Dekomori is the silly, stupid loli that all anime have to have. She is the servant to Rikka and uses her twintails as a weapon. She\u2019s the reason I almost quit the show.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, the initial six episodes are forgettable. They\u2019re all fairly generic and you\u2019d assume the rest of the show manages to continue to be crap.\\n\\n\r\nBut the last half is actually very touching. The reason for why Rikka is the way she is becomes apparent, a budding romance develops amongst much tragedy, and the ending (while fairly typical of anime of this type) manages to still be emotional and pretty powerful.\\n\\n\r\nEven if half the show is crap and the characters aren\u2019t great, I can give the little character development credit for being well executed and the animation is definitely fantastic. Characters look really good and environments are pretty. The one downside is how awful the tears look. Good God, dramatic scenes become hilarious because of how stupidly huge the tears are.\\n\\n\r\nAt first this show appears to be nothing less than a failed attempt at comedy (seriously, I might have chuckled three times over the course of the show) but as it progresses and the characters start to develop, you see that this isn\u2019t at all as generic as it seems. It manages to take a stupid concept like delusional weirdos having a club and makes that into a highly likeable romance that is both cute and touching at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nCute girls, cute romance, but an overall mediocre show. I\u2019m hoping that the second season manages to stay in touch with the romantic and character-specific side rather than the stupid goofiness of having eighth-grade syndrome. Or even strike a balance between the two. Because the show only seems to shine when it does just that, gets that balance between dumb and decent.",

            "content": "I was pulled into watching this anime when i first saw the character of Rika. I was then hooked to the anime from episode one. This anime portrays a slow yet hard boiled romance between the characters Rika and Yutta. At first i thought i wouldn't be interested in watching a slow romance between two characters because i found the idea tiring but after seeing this anime i thought the idea to be great. I really think that this anime is a must watch for Romance anime lovers and if you're looking for a unique concept then i still recommend this anime. I loved thisanime soo much and it made me wanna have the Chuunbiyou as well. I spent an entire day being dark at school and honestly i regret it now. Yeah, what can i say other than this was one hell of an anime\\n\\n\r\nLIKES:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime brings in a unique concept called the Chuunbiyou. It was also a risky move bringing it in because repeating a concept like this can be tedious. They did a great job of keeping it interesting and honestly i thought it was a genius move. I also loved the bond between Yuuta and Rikka. They didn't always show their romance growing in every episode but i think that was what made it realistic. At that age a relationship won't grow that fast. I also loved the art in the anime. It had vivid colors and some great fight scenes. I won't go as far as to say that the art was outstanding because we see the same great art in other anime. The next thing I absolutely LOOOVVEED in this anime was the character of Rikka. She isn't an ordinary character that you usually see in other anime. She doesn't lash on to the Yuuta every minute and she doesn't she has her own way of expressing what she thinks and feel. I also loved her design. She was like the cute girl that stood out because of her eye patch. some how she always looked cute with that eye patch but then again it could have just been me.\\n\\n\r\nDislikes. \\n\\n\r\nMy First dislike in this anime is more of a personal idea. The fight scenes were great but it was also kind of a let down to me. Every time i would see a fight scene i would be amazed and then i would cry inside because i knew that it wasn't real. The next thing i hated in this anime was the character of Sanae. This girl is just annoying in this anime. She is suppose to be Rikka's servant but instead she is like the exact opposite of a servant. She's like that loud mouth cousin  you have that thinks she's somehow usefull but really adds nothing but shame to you. I was never interested in her and neither will i ever be. Jeez, even Makato who only shows up in about 5 episodes was more interesting than Sanae. Uggh. she was honestly one of the worst characters i have ever scene.\\n\\n\r\nOver all though i still think that this is a must watch anime and it is definitely enjoyable throughout. I highly recommend this anime and thats why i gave this anime a rating of 9 out of 10.",

            "content": "WATCH CHUUNIBYOU THEY SAID. IT'S CUTE THEY SAID.\r\nI cried.\r\nI'll be honest, I don't quite remember where I heard of Chu2 (shortened for the sake of not ripping out my hair while typing). It was either MyAnimeList, or tumblr. Anyhow, I went in a bit unsure. I've liked shoujos in the past, such as Gekkan Shoujo, for example, but it didn't really sound very interesting. I was very pleasantly surprised. (I even laughed out loud on multiple occasions.)\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nThe first few episodes may seem a bit ... Childish. Boring. Even cringe-worthy and stupid. Please stick through them. I may be a bit biased here, butI connected with Yuta in the first few minutes. For those that don't know, chuunibyou is the state of that awkward kid in your class. It can happen at any age, but typically it's around older elementary to young middle school age. Chuunibyou is the kid that pretends they have magical powers. Chuunibyou is the kid who thinks he's a wolf. Chuunibyou is the girl who knows she's special because of a birthmark she's convinced makes her \"The Chosen One.\" I connected with Yuta in the first few minutes because I, too, went through the odd phase of pretending I was a cat. A warrior cat, to be exact. I enjoyed this anime because it has honest reactions to the embarrassments of when you were younger, while still connecting with and making it more understanding of what it feels like from the chuunibyou sufferer's point of view. The story is more serious than you would expect of a freshman romance, and if you've managed to spare yourself of Middle School Second Year Syndrome but desperately wanted to know JUST WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THEIR HEADS?, then this anime is perfect for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nThere are beautifully animated fight scenes. From the first entrance of the gorgeous weapons, I was already trying to think of how I'd word it in my review. For those who aren't too interested in shoujo, you can definitely still enjoy the action scenes. The design of the characters is unique and each character is easily definable from one another, even in little differences in a school uniform such as a cross hanging on Rikka's skirt, or the hair clip in Nibutani's hair.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nI'll be honest, I really don't listen much to the songs at the beginning or the end, but where they appeared in the middle of the anime were well-placed and fit the emotion of the scene as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\r\nEach character had very distinctive personalities. Even though at first glance Dekomori and Rikka are the same - delusional girls who think they're being recruited by the Wicked Lord Shingan - throughout the anime the two do nothing but develop. Isshiki is the lady's man who secretly has no idea what he's doing, and Nibutani is more than just a pretty face in the cast of characters, despite what many of the others think at the beginning. Even Kumin, who originally only shows up to sleep, has a personality of her own - kind-hearted and very lady-like, even if somewhat dense - that makes her shine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nI laughed at least a few times per episode, and I also cried more than once. Again, this may be a bias, since I've been where a few of the characters were, but I think it was also the show itself. I think they did a very nice job with the characters, and it's the type of friend group anyone would like to have. All in all, although it's mostly a light-hearted romance, there is much more to it, and more serious tones and messages. Yes, it is a shoujo anime, but it is also a message about acceptance, and about being who you are, being accepted for who you are, and finding the people that matter, and care about you no matter what. It is about grief and coping.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nI told myself when I started my account here that I would never give anything a perfect score overall. I mean, I was planning on saving it for something that truly mattered. But in the end, I realized I would recommend it to anyone, even to people who would hate it. Because it's not the first look that matters, it's the message, and the message hit me hard. It's something I would have loved to hear when I was younger, and I feel cheated to have only heard it now. Maybe it's a stupid anime to some, but to others it describes them perfectly. Whether it's the chuunibyou, or trying to fit in, or grieving and coping in odd ways - this anime is a good one. So you can take it as a light-hearted shoujo, or some stupid teenage girl's anime. Or you can take it as a message. You can take it as a show that there are people out there who will accept you for you and help you move on. That there are people who matter.",

I just can't handle people who are too childish and makes other people embarrassed for their actions, one of it is Dekomori. She would be my most hated character of the whole series. The series is actually funny. And of course, KyotoAni gives me another good animation. The characters actions and fluidity makes the one episode funny and not being dry. KyotoAni always give a good slice of life anime! The character designs are so cute too. Goddamn. All girls in this series are so cute.Shit. Another thumbs up. The whole series has a vibe of Tamako Market, the animation is so smooth! The comedy scenes are well arranged, and the whole pacing is good as well. For the main characters Rikka and Yuuta. I ship them since the first few eps. Their relationship is so cute and perfect! Everything is so perfect for a normal relationship! I always waited for a love/romance part of the series in the first half. I'm dying just to see them step right up. And well, it happened. I didn't see that coming. I mean the moment when rikka nearly fell and yuuta came to rescue her. And then she hug her. Shiiiiittttt. THAT WAS I AM LOOKING FORRRRRRRRR. That was so goooood and cute. Shit. No words at all. I'm screaming when I watched that scene. It was so good and smooth. And no comedy inserted, all pure seriousness, romance and drama. I thought this series would end up being a sliceoflife/comedy just like Tamako Market & Nozaki-kun. But its really good that the story moves to a romance after all. Great job! So about the ending. Actually for me its kinda good but kinda shitty as well. I mean, I kinda love how Yuuta comes to save Rikka. And a new hug scene was inserted again (I screamed) which is actually good. Because I totally want more.  HUG HER. KISS HER. HOLD HER HANDS YUUTA, YOU IDIOT. The whole club was there, which is nice. The past story about rikka's father, and where the little rikka saw yuuta's old self in 8th grade syndrome moment was so amazing. I didn't actually see that coming actually. Making it happens make their relationship or ship so strong. Fvccccckk. I want more to their love. But the ending was a little shit. I did not want rikka to be back again at her 8th grade syndrome, but definitely want the cute rikka to back soon. Her grandfather getting a gun, a policeman, chased by a police car in a bike, and yuuta at his dark flame master personality brokes the ending's vibe. Thus, makes the ending so shit. Just pure shit with that. Insert, I actually love the ending of ep. 11 when dekomori was hitted by a harsh reality. That was actually a good drama out there. Imagine a story that makes people laugh at few eps, then a dark past with a heavy drama appear on mid eps. Its actually a good, making the ending an episode looking forward to by the people who followed this series since first eps. The op was bad, but the animation was so cute. Well, all girls are so cute tbh, but senpai is the most cute among them all. Lol. Probably gonna hate this childish review (ironic) when I read this 20 years from now. Hahaha. Hi my future self. Now, getting back to the series. The ending kinda reminds me of toradora, the animation reminds me of Tamako market, and the whole series has this clannad vibes. Well all of this came from kyotoani, except for toradora. The first few eps are all about comedy scenes. The mid eps rises the romantic part, and preparing for the drama by having the glimpse of past. The ending hits you with a good blow for the heavy drama, hard hit of reality and a mind blowing romance, but a slight shitty ending. \ud83d\ude22 Overall, not bad. Gonna give this 7/10 at first thought. But the series gave me what I have been looking for, the romance. But didn't give the ending I want. So, an unbiased score of 9/10. KyotoAni always give the best sliceoflife/comedy/drama. Best character design (cuteness) compare to all studios. Thumbs up kyotoani for a nice series.",

            "content": "This series had so much potential. I REALLY want to love it and I like that it takes on issues that are all too often left behind by a lot of other series. \r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is, first and foremost, a comedy, with a romantic subplot taking the back seat; this makes it easy to enjoy, even for people like me, who don't normally dig rom-coms. In a lot of ways, this anime addresses the kids who aren't exactly on the same page with the rest of the class and paints them in a positive light. It almost feels like an autism awarenesscampaign at certain points, and to me, that is actually pretty cool. Anime like this make you understand how far off the beaten path you sometimes have to look in order to find someone interesting, and that's a breath of fresh air from all the other series I've seen recently.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really brings out the character of this anime is its characters. Takanashi Rikka, in particular, is a breath of fresh air from the archetypal tsundere heroine of any rom-com anime to have come out in the past 3 years (aside from Nyarlko-san, but that's beside the point), even if sometimes she's slightly annoying to watch because of how close she is to understanding something new about the world outside her own head, yet how far she is from practicing her understanding of things. The other characters, while interesting, unique, and funny to watch in their own ways, do serve little purpose, other than to back up the strength of the main two, but they're mostly at least memorable and fun to watch, even if the jokes get overplayed occasionally.\\n\\n\r\nIn the same way, however, the anime relies much too strongly on its characters. A lot of the rest of the execution, especially in its transition from manga to anime, is spotty. The plot pacing is all over the place, and even if that's understandable, given the nature of the characters, it still creates a visible distraction in the series, especially with the last few episodes taking things in a direction that I personally feel it didn't have to go in. The animation is top-notch for the imaginary fight scenes between the characters, but this doesn't mesh perfectly with the artwork itself, which feels minimalistic and somewhat avant-garde. Color schemes and motifs seem to be pulled from Yumekui Merry, in a weird sort of way; the contrast may be a little too high, which makes the environment appear dirty at times, which muddies up the softer, pastel-almost colors of the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSound work is somewhat cliche, even for anime standards. Moe characters have typical moe voices, which can work to make you want to watch more if that's what you're into. The music is okay, helping at least to serve the purpose of locking you into the story, but it's not remarkable. I've definitely heard better, but it's not a big enough deal to knock it down over.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, however, I really want to love this series. I would really recommend it for someone who's looking for a breath of fresh air, but doesn't care too much about plot pacing and can get around the various speed bumps Chuunibyou has to offer in its final presentation.",

            "content": "Honestly, it is once in a blue moon that we, the viewers of Anime, are graced with an anime this good. To call it excellent would be an understatement. I am sure, in a few years this will be a classic. Not since THE MELANCHOLY OF SUZUMIYA HARUHI have I seen an anime this good. Ladies and gentlemen, may I humbly present, CHUUNIBYOU DEMO KOI GA SHITAI!.\r\nThe most basic way to describe CHU 2, is an anime about young love, the same theme that ran through my aforementioned favorite anime, THE MELANCHOLY OF SUZUMIYA HARUHI. Or what it is like to fall in love forthe first time. Yes, there are supernatural themes, (light) pervert humor, and tsundere we all know and love, but the main theme in CHU 2 is definitely love. Whether that love comes from our protagonist, Yuuta or the love of Rikka's family, this anime is all about dealing with loved ones.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot revolves around Rikka, a girl suffering from chuunibyou, or Eighth-grade Syndrome, basically when you are starting to become an adult you try and pull away by having a more active imagination. Starting high school Rikka quickly makes a friends with Yuuta, a boy who is freshly removed from his own case of chuunibyou. Yuuta hates his \u201cold\u201d self, but Rikka refuses to break from her world of sorcery and the occult. Along the way, they form a new club and gather (or force) four other characters together. Humor usually stems from Yuuta trying to rid himself of his old ways and Rikka's constant acting out. Drama comes from the turbulent past Rikka is \u201crunning\u201d from. Action comes from Rikka's fantasies where magic and big swords are real.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is stunning. The quick action cuts, to the smooth flow of the characters' movement, everything is done most excellently. It reminds me a lot of the animation style of HYOUKA and THE MELANCHOLY OF SUZUMIYA HARUHI. The sound design is also very good. Listening on surround sound headphones I got a lot of directionality, as well as on a 5.1 surround sound system. The voice acting should also be commended as it is a articulate and full of character as one could get. Technically, CHU 2 is a perfect example of how to do anime right. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about this anime and what has me so positive about it is the way it blends the genres so seamlessly. Yes, there is a kind of about face midway through, plot wise, but the best part about CHU 2 is how the creators weaved in so many funny beats, dramatic cliffs, and completely enthralling action bits. Whenever we, the audience, get to break reality with Rikka, what occurs is what the BLACK ROCK SHOOTER anime should have been. A young girl's escape into a world where she is in the \u201cDriver's Seat.\u201d Power, bravery, and control is what Rikka has in her world, but sadly she lacks these traits in reality. As she progresses as a character, we learn how this came to be and just what it will take for her to regain her \u201cself\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I disliked about CHU 2 was its length. 12 episodes was definitely not enough for me. This could easily have been a 22 or 24 series. If I had to be really picky, there could have been more character development on Rikka's sister, but that is being really picky. Overall, there is not much I can really complain about CHU 2, it was just a darn good anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this is anime for people who like quirky humor, drama type animes. It is not some kind of serious teenage drama, but there is plenty of it. Neither is it a supernatural type anime. But it blends a lot of genres in a way that is pleasing and never makes you wish for more of any one type. This is one anime where if you do not like the first episode it may not be for you, but if you enjoy it, this will be one of the most rewarding \u201ctrips\u201d you will ever take.\\n",

I have to say that that decision was one of the best ones I've made in relevance to anime over the last quarter of 2012.\r\nThe first half of the anime does a fairly good job of introducing the characters, later showing the viewers their true colours and what they represent inliterature. Meanwhile, the second half, the one that I have decided to focus my review on, is the philosophical question of: What is one of the greatest things that human beings inherently fear? \\n\\n\r\nI came to the conclusion that the answer is simply, ourselves. We as humans try so hard in everyday life to fit in - to be part of the norm that society has created for itself, and we have been so blinded to see that disorder would only ensue if we showed our true selves to the world.\\n\\n\r\nBut Chuunibyou defies that theory completely! The truth of the matter is, our true selves, our self-consciousness is and will be forever a part of us. It is something that society cannot simply change. This is a great factor that separates human beings from other living creatures on Earth - we have a conscious mind which allows us complete free will and self power!\\n\\n\r\nI truly recommend this anime to anyone who feels that their true self isn't good enough for the world, because truly I tell you, this anime may just be the thing to change your mind. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, I loved the Mayan Apocalypse 2012 reference in the last episode :D",

            "content": "Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions are in the air! \r\nTo put it in layman's terms: This is an anime about the transition from childhood to adulthood, and how real-world problems influence our over-time transition from children who had imaginative and creative minds to hardened adults whose sense of reality has long lost its old luster. In a way, this anime is also about taking a stand against a stark and dull reality, and reworking it into a world of their imagination that is much more grand despite the constant nay-saying of the normal populace and the rest of the world.\r\nWhen you begin to watch thisseries, it may begin to take you back to your days of youth, when you honesty believed that you might be able to do some of the things you saw your favorite heroes do in T.V. shows of old. I myself found it sort of saddening to watch this through, as now, a man at the age of 20 I can't help but think of all the wonderful times I had back then in blissful ignorance about the harsh reality's of the world and all the cruel peer pressure that conformed me into the person I am today.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, Yuuta and Rikka are our main protagonist, and have a somewhat ironic relationship. Yuuta has just transitioned from eighth grade into High school and is an ex-Chuunibyou and has seemingly just got his life back on track to sweet, sweet normalcy that he has longed for. Determined to make a fresh start in Highschool, he puts his past behind him and sets forward. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, things quickly go from bad to worse as Rikka, who is currently a Chuunibyou herself promptly affixes herself to Yuta under his old guise of the \"Dark Flame Master\" much to his chagrin. Becoming a much unwanted link to his old self, Yuuta's life takes a turn for the strange just as he thought he cleared his name.\\n\\n\r\nI came back to this anime because in my opinion, it seems like everything released nowadays is just lifeless garbage holding nothing spectacular to it, no hidden meaning, nothing grandeur about them. They're dull, where this anime is a precious pearl. \\n\\n\r\nSo would I recommend it? Yes. This anime is amazing. You definitely won't regret it.\\n\\n\r\nBanishment, this woooooooooooooooooorld!",

            "content": "Chuunibyou demo koi ga shitai is an endearing anime I was instantly drawn to by its unique character designs and colourful, appealing artwork but I soon learned there was a thrilling, heart warming story to this anime.\r\n Story \r\n Chuunibyou demo, at first glance may seem like yet another mediocre anime focused on moe aspects and fan service. Although the anime did contain plenty of moe moments and bikini scenes it was used at nice moderation and had relevance to the story. I'm not going to waste time explaining the story since its mentioned in the summary but it is basically a mixture ofsilly, sarcastic humour and cutesy romance. The first couple of episodes are what you expect of the first couple of episodes but it isn't until further on when it steers to a more intense story line. Another eye watering, emotional tale of a girl and her struggles and a boy and his regrets.\\n\\n\r\n Characters\\n\r\n Getting to know the characters was a key highlight in this anime because of there charming relationships with each other and the fascination that went with it. Rikka Takanashi is the main female protagonist and the most appealing because of her quirky personality and interesting character development. Yuuta Togashi exceeded my expectations of the male protagonist as I sometimes find the male protagonists are very same-ish and repetitive in their appearance and personality.But Yuuta changed my perspective. I felt some characters were left in the shadows as we saw little of side characters like Dekomori, Nibutani and Kumin.\\n\\n\r\n Art & Animation\\n\r\n It was the art that drew me to this anime with the original character designs and appealing colours and with obvious similarities to the K-on girls I couldn't help give it a watch. In this anime I was satisfied with the fluent animation and stunning, night scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n The opening was acceptable but I felt for chuunibyou it was a bit calm and it could have used a more dramatic soundtrack for this part. The ending was nice and I felt it was relevant to representing the Chuunibyou syndrome. The bgm and OST's were lovely and used correctly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Chuunibyou is an endearing, charming anime with a romance/comedy theme to it. Loveable characters and a fascinating plotline. Worth the watch.\\n\\n",

I mean, it's not aa bad thing, nor a good thing. While you watch this anime, it is fun in the few episodes, but as you get more into the story, it kind of... Well, it gets more worrisome, whatever you think will happen DOES NOT happen at all. Don't get mewrong (You haters), everything was PERFECT but the story line. However, given in the thoughts I would have said this anime would get a Mediocre grade, even if it teaches a life lesson. But, whether this anime was good or not between 0-5 of watching this, I would say 2.

            "content": "\"Forced to combat either nature or society, you must make your choice between the man and the citizen, you cannot train both.\"\r\nIf you walked up to me on the street tomorrow and asked me what Chuunibyou was about, I'd probably answer something along the lines of \"there's a weird girl who does cute things and my heart exploded\".  I'd just leave it at that, give it a ten, and recommend it to anyone who likes anything mentioned in the above, but it's not that simple.  It never is.\r\nI started the show pretty soon after it started airing; prior to this I didn't reallycare for anything Kyoto Animation had done (since I hadn't seen much of their work) but I kept an open mind.  It was nice to see that it wasn't a waste, since everything in the show is great.  The art and music are both outstanding, the characters are nice (for the most part), and the story kept me captivated until I got to the end of the last episode. Sounds good from here, right?  This is actually where the problem starts.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, after the last episode, I thought about how good it was for about a day, and proceeded to forget about it entirely for the next two months.  About two days ago, in the middle of a daydream, I suddenly remembered:  \"Oh yeah, Chuunibyou.  That was really cool.\" and returned to tend to the other thoughts floating in my head.  I didn't really take anything from it that's stayed with me since then.  Everything I've given a ten to has stuck with me since I finished the show, and most likely before that.  To put it another way, everything I have give a ten to has set a standard (in my mind) for something, and holds that position alone.  Bakemonogatari set my standard for a male main character (and being artsy as possible), Gurren Lagann set my standard for over-the-top, hot-blooded action and testosterone poisoning, etc.  I loved Chuunibyou, but it didn't do anything remotely close to that.  It did mostly everything extremely well, but it's all been done better or equally well before.  A strange girl who does cute things has been done by Denpa Onna, the cringe-factor brought up by the titular eighth-grade syndrome has been done by Watamote, and all the technical factors have already been superseded by other works.  Nothing it did stood out as being the best example of something having been done.\\n\\n\r\nI think some of this problem comes from the ending of the final episode, which suddenly, and in no way subtly, handed me the moral of the story:  \"Chuunibyou\" is caused by us humans and our natural self-consciousness, and there is no reason to feel ashamed of having it or having had it, as it's only being true to one's self.  This is a good lesson for anyone to learn, I agree, but it's a lesson that's wasted on me.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm not trying to say that I didn't do stuff I regret as a kid.  The moral's wasted because it's just redundant.  The lesson to \"be yourself\" is one that everyone's heard a million times, and I happened to read something at about the same time that gave me a similar message that is both more inclusive and less subtle.  I'm not gonna say what it was, but it basically said that it's ideal to live in a way that is neither dependent upon nor governed by other men, and it gave me a little bit of a push towards an individualist way of thinking.  I suppose that would mean Chuunibyou just ended up unfortunate, but I don't quite think it's that, either.  In any case, Chuunibyou's attempt to make a lasting impact didn't work at all.\\n\\n\r\nRikka's still plenty cute, though, and maybe you'll take more from it than I did.  Now that I'm done tearing the moral and my perspective apart and looking at them up close, might as well get down to it:  I'd recommend Chuunibyou to basically anyone, as it's very very good and I enjoyed it a lot.  However, if you're looking for a contender as one of the best shows you'll ever see, it will probably slip under the radar.  I hate to say it, as I truly feel that it should have earned a ten, but it's just not quite enough.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, after thinking through this review, it's starting to shine a little bit brighter.  I never delved that deeply into the moral, and maybe it just got overshadowed by whatever shows I happened to pick up shortly after.  I'll have to give it a rewatch one of these days.",

            "content": "\"Even if you hear that, even if you try to deal with it, sometimes things happen one after another, and you can't just deal with it. So you handle them the only way you know how.\"\r\nWhen I first started Chuunibyou, I expected a lighthearted comedic slice of life, and that's what I got. But the story delved much deeper than I thought it would, making bold statements about youth, coping, and individuality.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe anime starts out simply enough and sets low expectations, but the plot certainly escalates. The premise itself is one of the most original anime stories I've heard of: a slice of lifethat mixes reality with fantasy in a whole new way. The execution of the premise is extremely well done. The pace is relaxed, but not too slow, and the story develops at a reasonable level. The first quarter does make it out to be a bit of mindless entertainment, but that's fixed by the halfway point. The romance is also natural instead of forced. What I find most important, though, is the fact that they took a premise with such great potential and made something equally as great from it. The story has a deeper meaning to it. Granted this meaning can feel jumbled and unclear sometimes, and you might feel like the message changes, but it's there, and that alone raised my overall rating.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nMost of the characters don't have an incredible amount of depth, but that's to be expected from this genre, and in this anime, they don't need it. The story revolves around the two protagonists with the other characters supporting them, so what matters is that Yuuta and Rikka develop throughout the show, which they do. They have reasons for being the way they are, which makes them more believable, and they change in realistic ways that many people can relate to. They face problems that the viewers can relate to, like coping with loss, wanting to feel special, wanting to avoid embarrassment, accepting reality, and being what makes them happy. The characters are also very likable most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe animation is stunning. Whether it's a character's eyes, a sunset, or an epic battle, the show never fails to be pleasing to look at. The appearances of the characters are cute but not unbearably moe, the scenery is stunning, and the movements are always smooth.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack molds to the story perfectly, enhancing all the emotional moments, but it's not too over-the-top for a slice of life anime. Still, the addition of certain songs to certain scenes definitely improved the emotional experience. The sound itself is also fitted to the animation and no obvious errors are present.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nAdmittedly, I did pass through the first few episodes without thinking too far into the story, because I didn't think it would be necessary. I definitely enjoyed watching the anime, though, and the only reason my enjoyment is a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 is because of one episode that I thought to be more of a filler and enjoyed a bit less. Once I realized that the show was trying to communicate a deeper message to me, however, I started enjoying it even more, especially the last three episodes. I never expected something like this to make such bold statements about being human, and it increased my appreciation for Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! tenfold.\\n\\n\r\nWhether you're looking for a short slice of life to keep you entertained or something to teach you about accepting reality, this anime will likely suit your needs, and it definitely deserves to be recommended more often.",

            "content": "\"Chuunibyou\" is one of the anime I knew literally nothing about, yet its poster looked intriguing enough for me to consider watching it. One short gif of it was actually enough to encourage me to watch the show in the end, and man, am I grateful I did! Let me start from the beginning though.\r\n\"Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!\" is another slice of life anime in a school setting, plus it's a rom-com. For whatever reason that concept never gets boring, making it feel entirely fresh is a different thing though. \r\nThe story's protaganist is Yuuta, a guy about to face the reality of goingto high school. He feels insecure about his past and how he was acting in middle school, purposely choosing to continue his studies far from his home, hoping not to come across people he used to know. Unfortunately, reality is far from how he imagined his future and eventually he finds himself surrounded by things he was so desperate to forget about. \\n\\n\r\nWhen a girl named Rikka becomes his neighbor AND turns out to go to the same class as he does, all of his efforts seemingly go for nothing, as Yuuta sees all of his former traits in her. The gal decides to stick to our protagonist, for she does not seem to have any other actual friends, excluding Dekomori, her internet friend, who also \"suffers\" from the \"chuunibyou\" state of mind.  He, on the other hand, is far from being fond of her way of being. However, as their relationship progresses and he understands her better, Yuuta becomes a bit more understanding, eventually lowering the pressure he was trying to put on Rikka to change her.  \\n\\n\r\nAn important part of the story are the \"delusions\", presented as actually well animated fights. In reality they may be e.g. a battle between an adult with a laddle and a kid with an umbrella, the way Rikka and some others see them are far more impressive though, making the experience unique. \\n\\n\r\n\"Chuunibyou\" is quite possible the most wholesome and heartwarming story I've ever seen, leaving me with a big grin every few scenes. The comedy is great as well, ideally exaggerateted and able to catch you off guard multiple times. The characters are a strong aspect of the anime, especially Yuuta made the journey feel real. I have to admit, I do relate to him: escaping his past, trying to avoid it at all costs, even if it means entirely changing his environment. Seeing your old features in others and persuading them to change themselves feels just as real to me and I did feel guilty watching some of the episodes to be fair. After all, trying to change the way your friends are may not do any good. You may now dislike what you used to enjoy in the past, but it is okay for others to still like it. Even if their behavior feels weird or, in this case, childish, if it makes them genuiely happy, what point is in trying to take their happiness away from them?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, \"Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!\" is without a doubt one of my favorite anime so far. Its original take on the genre, entertaining comedy and the fact it is such a heart-warmer made me thoroughly enjoy it. It made me draw some conclusions from it and hopefully it will make me a better person in the end.",

Rikka is now one of my favorite characters, from how childish she was to how much mature she got. The way she called Yuuta kinda melted my heart. I love watching the romance between the two inexperienced lovers. How childish it was with adult feelings is just priceless. The fights were fun to watch because of the dramatic imagination and the switch to reality. There are so many highlight moments that you couldjust make a movie from them. There are so many parts of this anime that I love. It was so cute from the characters to the story.",

            "content": "a nutshell. Chuunibyou is a really cute anime with LOADS of fantasy. \\n\\n\r\nStory. \\n\r\nAs probably every boy, the mc imagened in hes past that he's a hero. 'The dark flame master' *echo in the background*. And as probably every boy they later cringe about theirself. ''Why did i thought that i was a super hero'' And the mc try's to forget about that. Going to a different school hoping to avoid he's past. But ofcourse those thing's never turn out as he hope's. A cute girl with an eye patch has the same problem. But is still stuck living in this imagination. She try's to convince the mc to be the ''dark flame master'' again. I think it's a pretty cute story. But it's a bit over the top. It annoy's me sometimes when thing's are getting serious that it randomly changes to the dark underground fantasy world. That's a bit dissapointing. The lack of serious situation's didn't really made it easy for me to watch. Filled with humor and some cool scene's  i give the story a 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art style is pretty good. And i really like the art style. It's cute. and well detailed. That deserves an 8. \\n\\n\r\nSound. \\n\r\nI love the intro song's. They are really fitting with the serie's. Also the bg music really fits. cute and funny. I give this a 7. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter's.\\n\r\nOh boy. The character's. Uhm where to start? The mc is ok. nothing really stand out. But like i stated before on eye patched girls. This is one thing that annoy's me. And there isn't a reason why the eye patched girl is wearing it. It still annoy's me. Take it of you look more cute without it! Also the other's, A girl that prefer's to sleep alway's. A famous hot chick and the loly that adore's the female mc. The cast is good enough for a entertaining show. But it just doesn't stand out  to other anime's. Yeah the silly fantasy's are funny. But annoyed me quickly. So that's a 6. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. \\n\r\nIt was a decent story (I count this review as season 1 + 2) It was fun to watch. But it's just a story that excist in fillers. There's almost no progress. The character grow almost nothing to eachother. And that's for me important when there's a slice of a life / romance anime. The humor was good. So i give it a 7. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nYeah, i have to admit. While i was watching i enjoyed it. The humor was pretty good. It's cute. And not everything can be the next Clannad romance or ToraDora! follow up. It's really unique and because of that it's worth watching it. Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai (I had to re-search the name so many times because it was a pretty complicated name) Thank you for the 24 episode's of enjoyment! here's a 7 :)",

            "content": "I decided to go in for a second viewing of the first season of Chu-2 after listening to some grumblings about how it was not that good. So, my impression of the season before was as following:\r\n'\"Growing up doesn't mean packing up all the things you enjoy in your youth, but in learning moderation and compromise.' Unfortunately that was not the message that this anime decided to go with. Instead it was an anime about a bunch of adults dumping their family problems on a first year high school boy's shoulders and him making a child decision at the end of the season; which clashesheavily with the slapsticky and deweyeyed tone of Chu-2.\"\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching, I realize my impression of the first season had been poisoned by the extra episodes and the second season. In reality the end of this first season wrapped up everything nicely and and our two main characters that moving forward is not mutually exclusive with denying your past. Now, I still have a problem with the majority of the adult characters in this story. Not that a bunch of adults dumping their burdens on a high school kid is unrealistic, but because those same actions where treated as comedic events, and not treated with the weight they deserved.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other things: I really enjoyed that the normal everyday scenes were animated with just as much care as the\"fight\" scenes. I thought the voice acting was good, but not anything special. I really liked our main and side main characters, however those side characters were mostly chunks of personality throughout the majority of the story and weren't given much depth until the end. And, I'm pretty sure I laughed just as much this second time around.\\n\\n\r\nSo ya, 8/10 and avoid the second season and Christmas ova if you can.\\n",

            "content": "In the beginning I thought it is just a random comedy series, but then it turns out to be one of the best animes I've ever seen. Originally I didn't intend to watch this anime, but I saw a polling of a \"most-waited anime\" and hence I gave a shot to watch this anime.\r\n\"Chuunibyou\" basically means \"eight-grader syndrome\", and  it is a \"sickness\" Japanese person usually have for having imagination and mixed it with your real life. For example, you do believe yourself possess a magic power, and everywhere you go you dressed like a wizard.\r\nYou probably had \"Chuunibyou\" during your junior high schooland you want to put it behind when you entered senior high school, and that's the beginning of Chuu-2. But forgetting your embarrasing past stories not that easy, your friend or your family might always brings up your past, and your friends is still on \"Chuunibyou\". You might also have friends in same boat, which also had \"Chuunibyou\" in their past.\\n\\n\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 10\\n\r\nThe storyline didn't develop too quickly in the beginning, and as I said, I thought it was just a random comedy series, but in the middle of the series, it began to develops well. They reveal the past of some characters, and Rikka's past and why she possesses Chuunibyou was nicely put, from the middle towards the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe love story between character was also developed well, in an unexpected way. Expect the unexpected, there are some unpredictable stories, and I couldn't even guess correctly the ending of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the characters had fight, I always could feel the tension between them. Nearing the end of the series, the story became so touching, as they reveals all the past of the main character, and  I even cried in the last episode, it was so touching. \\n\\n\r\nWell, the most important thing in story of Chuunibyou is they are able to close the series very well, as some series failed to do. Chuunibyou ending was quite momerable, IMO. Some of other series had a good early stories, but then it failed to develop towards the end and they ended as could-be-better anime.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\\n\r\nART 10\\n\r\nI simply love the art, KyoAni did a brilliant job designing the Character, and the battle scene was excellent as it was a real battle. They made the main heroines very adorable, and yet it wasn't too fanservicing, like other series did. \\n\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 9\\n\r\nCatchy opening, you could even tried to do the \"Woop Woop\" Rikka do in the opening.\\n\r\nAt first I didn't really like the ending but after I heard it few times it is actually a  nice song.\\n\r\nThe instrumental songs are nice, I liked the middle part transition song.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 10\\n\r\nIn the earlier of the story, the background of each character is still unknown, but then they are revealed very well in each episode.\\n\\n\r\nYuuta is the main character and he wanted to forget his past, and wanted to become a normal student like everyone does.\\n\\n\r\nTakanashi Rikka as the Chuunibyou girl is well made, and all her actions make you can't stop smiling or sometimes laughing.\\n\\n\r\nShinka Nibutani, as the most beautiful girl in the class, was great. You will find more about her secret throughout the series, and she is actually *peeeeep*. She is the wise person among the main characters, and she is always willing to help their person.\\n\\n\r\nDekomori, Rikka's servant, I was quite annoyed by her attitude, but I realized that Dekomori made the series much more funny with her \"Desu\" and some crazy stuff he did with Rikka.\\n\\n\r\nKumin was the sleeping senpai who sleeps everywhere, while Isshiki is Yuuta's best friend who always thought he knows everything.\\n\\n\r\nTakanashi Tooka is a typical strict-sister, but actually, she really loves Rikka\\n\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 10\\n\r\nNaturally, I enjoyed moe series, and I liked Chuu-2 very much. Every episodes is as enjoyable as the whole series, I enjoyed laughing, smiling, saying \"so sweet\" seeing the relationship between some of the characters, and even crying together with Chuu-2. I always feels like \"Eh, this episode ended already!\", and I always looked forward for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 10\\n\r\nSo what Chuunibyou has :\\n\r\nHilarious Jokes \\n\r\nMoe Character \\n\r\nCatchy OP \\n\r\nTouching Story \\n\r\nMuch-better-than-twilight Love Story \\n\r\nMemorable Ending\\n\r\nNice Moral Stories\\n\r\nNostalgic Story (probably you had \"Chuunibyou\" also)\\n\\n\r\nBest anime this season, I have to say... This is a must-watch anime! \\n\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review, and thank you for reading it! ^^",

            "content": "Chuunibyou, to put it bluntly, is about a group of high school students that are mentally insane.  That being said, Chuunibyou puts this idea into a good sense and has a heartwarming tale that ends in a less then satisfactory ending.\r\nStory:  The story of Chunnibyou has an interesting plot.  The first half doesn't really go too much into either aspect of what this anime is known for.  Mostly, it's just character introductions and character relations that give the story's premise.  Though that sounds really boring, the first half isn't all that bad.  In fact, it's quite good in showingthe baseline for the show.  However, it's the second half that really gets people.  The second half revolves around the 2 main protagonists and explains why the main female, Rikka, talks about magic and looks like Misaki Mei from Another.  The story gets to the point where it grips you into it and never lets you go, sending the viewer into a turmoil of emotions, and wanting to know what happens in the next episode.  That being said, the story's \"magic\" element falls into the category of OP'ness, where the fighting scenes, (yes, there are fighting scenes), are so unneeded and insane, that it's hilarious.  For a moment, it's easy to forget that you're watching a romantic comedy when watching that stuff in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Other then the 2 main protagonists, the rest of the \"main\" cast have nothing.  When I mean by that, I mean that the character development and idea go way beyond.  The story revolves around Rikka and Yuuta, the 2 main characters.  Because of that, the rest of the main cast sort of, help out and push the story along.  That's not to say they're some background character.  While for the most part, they only play a specific role, the rest of the main cast actually does have a proper backstory, and reasoning for actually being here.  They are well rounded and well done as other characters.  Particularly because they are also affected by Chuunibyou.  Yuuta, being the main male, has a history as Dark Flame Master, or DFM.  Wanting to forget his past, he does everything he can to go and forget it, until he meets Rikka, and his plan falls apart...  Rikka, Mei's little sister/twin moe whatever.  Main female!  As the center of this show, she doesn't appear to be as important as she really is.  As the Wicked Eye, she searches for the Etheral Horizon for a specific thing that she must do.  \\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:  The art in this anime, could arguably be a cross between K-on, Another, and Angel Beats, as this is another one of Kyoto ani's works.  That being said, the anime does have a moe feel to it, prominent whenever one of the girls gets slightly abused.  Another thing to note is that the \"weapons\" that are in this anime, are extremely detailed and look awesome!  (just putting that in there).  The music in this anime feel...very blah.  It's not the most best thing to listen feel due to its generic feel.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment:  Ok pyra, why do you like this anime so much?  It's because, moe!  Kidding.  What I love about this, is the deep meaning in this anime.  While it's cutesy and fun with all the magic and make-believe, the story itself, especially in the latter half, become more intense.  As a result, the story becomes more gripping, telling me that I want to know what happens next.  The comedy itself is pretty good to.  However, if there was anything that would make me not like this, it would be the romantic aspect and ending.  The romantic aspect was prominent, but it wasn't as intense as I would've liked in a romantic comedy.  To me, the romantic aspect seemed as a side plot and only was used to bolster the relationship the 2 had, but it was still there, so I'm happy.  (personal complaint)  For the ending, it sort of ended as a bit of a disappointment with how there was no collective end to it.  That being said, it leaves open for a sequel, which...I think is coming.  Anyway, Chuunibyou is a fun and cute anime with a real meaning to it.  I enjoyed it well, and Kyoto ani should be proud with itself for what its done.",

            "content": "There was this certain time that I just kept browsing MAL to see what animes are worth watching, reading recommendations and choosing which anime I should watch next. Then I came across this strange title Chuunibyou demo koi ga shitai. Actually, this was already recommended by a friend of mine, but paid attention after seeing it on MAL.\r\nAt first glance on the cover picture of the anime, I thought that this anime is an action anime wherein a Schoolgirl is involved in some kind of sorcery involving magic and world war 1 guns. I was mistaken. It has a different plot according to what Ihave read. Then eventually, I started watching it. To tell you the truth, I really got attached to this anime. From the beginning, somewhere in my heart, something is screaming, I just realized that this anime truly understands what I feel. Escaping the harsh reality through imagination, making everything more fun than being normal. It is touching my very essence of childhood that I never knew still living in me, and enabled me to visualize that we are the ones choosing to make this reality a boring life, or a fun one just like the mangas :p  \\n\\n\r\nBecause of such insparational anime (in my POV) I gave the plot a 9/10 because it really caught my attention and also my heart. But really, it's still not my perfect anime plot.\\n\\n\r\nI am giving Art an 8/10. I just liked how their personalities fits their art.\\n\\n\r\nSounds, a 9/10 will do. The opening and ending song fitted the story. Especially the ending, which talks about finding our self. The OST, I can't say that much but in my perspective, the OST is enough to match the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10. Need to say more?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is perfect to me, I really enjoyed the anime, to the point that I pointed out how I felt about the anime in my introduction.\\n\\n\r\n- FreeKill38",

            "content": "Genre: Comedy/School/Slight Romance *No Spoilers*\r\nStory 8/10: A freshman in high school named Yuuta once had \"8th grade syndrome\". This is a phase where the person believes they're a superhero type character and acts like it in public, and at all times. In order to forget his embarrassing past, he transferred to a new high school. He then meets a girl named Rikka who currently has 8th grade syndrome and follows him around. The story unravels from there. \r\nArt 9/10: The characters, scenery, and colors are up to date, as expected from a 2013 anime. Overall the anime is pretty to look at and of goodquality. The \"fight scenes\" where hilarious, and actually pretty flashy/cool. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: The OP/ED are enjoyable, the voices of the character were okay. The music for the fight scenes was well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: The characters are semi-funny, some are extremely annoying at some points but the viewer can still empathize with them with things get serious. My favorite character has to be Rikka's older sister, just for her personality and actions. \\n\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment/Overall 8/10: The anime is sort of funny, not an anime to die of laughter, it's simply just a quick enjoyable show. I found that at the end of the anime, I actually could not come to a conclusion whether it was okay for someone to continue with the 8th grade syndrome, or if they should conform with society to meet the expectations of others. I thought there would be a clear answer towards the end, but I ended up having no freaking idea. The anime left me puzzled which decision would have been the \"right\" or \"better\" one.*\\n\\n\r\n*I would recommend this anime for anyone looking for a quick school comedy. If you were a kid who imagined you had super powers as a child, then this will probably make you laugh a lot.",

            "content": "Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! really surprised me. On the outside it seems like it would be your standard \"High School Love Story\" fare and on some level it is just that, but it incorporates so many varied and unique aspects the whole thing feels like a new experience. In short it is well worth your time. In long read on. \r\nThe story is as mentioned above, on some level a \"High School Love Story\". The first thing I thought after the first episode was \"Great, it's another love triangle\". That was quickly blown out of the water which was a surprising and fresh changethat I was not expecting. (The whole Nibutani character was great, all tsun and no dere). Not to mention how genuinely funny the Anime was. I found myself laughing out loud more than a few times, I generally don't laugh when I'm watching something by myself. The pacing was another stand-out feature, it goes on for as long as it feels it should. It doesn't drag and content in not re-used to fill up time either. The ending is really something as well. The whole thing is worth your time just off that. \\n\\n\r\nThe real standout in this entire charade though are the characters. They (by their very nature) are unique and varied. Their interactions with one another are both believable and highly entertaining. That's not to say that they are perfect. Some aspects of nearly all the characters are quite generic, but I feel that those aspects for one are nearly impossible to abolish anyways and two only help to bring out their more quirky side. Speaking of quirky, the whole Middle School Second Year Syndrome thing was brilliant. It's what turned Chuunibyou from something above average to something excellent. Seeing the characters still suffering from it (Dekomori and Rikka) and those in rehab (Nibutani and Yuuta) and their interactions are what made this for me. They were hilarious at points and touching at others. Sometimes both. I especially appreciated the flashbacks and occasional relapses of both Nibutani and Yuuta. (Ahem Mori Summer and the Dark Flame Master respectively). \\n\\n\r\nOther aspects of Chuunibyou were indeed above average, in particular the Art style. I found it to be very polished as well as relevant to the story and character types. But the real standouts are the indeed the story and especially the characters. They make this anime great, spectacular even. I had a blast watching this, the whole way through, and I'm not gonna lie, the end made me shed a few man tears. This would easily make my top anime of 2012. If you have the time (You should, it's only 12 episodes!) and you're in the mood for a good laugh and a quite relevant \"moral to the story\". In fact, I think the moral to this Anime is incredibly relevant in today's culture. It's not preachy and I don't feel that they leave it open to interpretation either. But it's important nonetheless, it has certainly affected my thinking process since I've watched it. There's something for everybody here.",

            "content": "2nd Review:\r\nMy impression of this anime from the first episode was...well...me. I like to escape reality when I find it too difficult. I just daydream all day when I feel bored. I like to cos play and act like my favorite character sometimes, too. \r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! or Regardless of My Adolescent Delusions of Grandeur, I Want A Date! takes a romantic comedy and combine it with all the cos playing and fantasies one could ever hope for!\r\nStory [8/10]:\r\n  Despite all of it's comedic and fantasy-like moments, this anime twisted my emotions around. One minute, I was seeing the 'Wielder of theWicked Eye' attempting to summon the 'Dark Flame Master', and the next, people who are slowly trying to rethink and reflect on themselves while looking at the 'Horizon'. That's just the kind of story I had to deal with and it was all great. (A few tearjerker moments that really touched me, too.)\\n\\n\r\nArt [9/10]:\\n\r\n  I just want to thank people like those of Kyoto Animation for doing such an awesome job with this anime. The characters were well done, the  background features were clean, I love what they did with the delusions as well. The transitions are smooth, for the most part, just a little bit choppy in some scenes. But, other than that, no complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nSound [8/10]:\\n\r\n  Whether it's upbeat music or just a quiet, little tune on a piano, the sound in this anime fits well with many parts. They are, for the most part, what I though set the mood and atmosphere. The emotional scenes were set with something beautiful and the funny parts, well, let's say, were more quirky. The opening and ending songs were energetic and explained the story and what some of the characters were going through as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter[9/10]:\\n\r\n   I absolutely loved the characters of this story. I  loved how they were making their delusions come to life. I also loved those that are trying to switch from those horrible memories they lived to a normal life. Take Yuuta Togashi and Shinka Nibutani, The 'normal' ones of the group. Then, from the mood-makers of the story, enter people like Rikka Takanashi and Sanae Dekomori who aren't afraid to clown around and say embarrassing things no one wants to hear. With all these characters,  it made sure to keep me interested.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment[10/10]:\\n\r\n  This anime reminded me of what I don't have. Lack of embarrassment, love(I'm single, got a problem?), and all that imagination I would die to have. The eye-catching scenes in every episode, whether it'd be dramatic, comedic  or those delusional battle scene performances are what kept me hooked, leaving me to want more of it. Almost every aspect of this anime also seem to fit together quite nicely in every episode as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [10/10]:\\n\r\n  If i could, I would give every person who contributed to this anime a pat on the back and give them a 100+ word comment on everything they did well. This anime left me wanting more of these goofy characters that I found insatiable. Thank goodness that they are making a sequel to this anime!",

Rikka though, is the perfect person to play this role, as she made this show what it is, and that's greatness. I love the entirety of this concept \"Chuunibyou\" as it takes something that kids would imagine, and makes it reality for many in this series.\r\nI think the art is just great.From the light shining off the cars into the water from a distance. To the crispness of the battle scenes that make it very much believable make the art one of the best I've seen in anime yet. \\n\\n\r\nSound isn't bad, as the theme song does get stuck in your head...but not much else going for the sound here; besides the epic-ness of the battles.\\n\\n\r\nLike I've said. Rikka made this anime what it is. She's such a unique character with a sad backstory that covers up her past with Chunnibyou lifestyles, along with others that influence her on a daily. While also pertaining to other's and their horrid past of being in the Chunnibyou stage, as they go back and forth on the entire scenario.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I was really impressed. I loved every minute of this show and can't wait to watch the second season! If you've ever had childhood fantasy's of going outside with your imaginary friends and pretending to have fire coming from your hands, then you should give this show a try!",

            "content": "Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! really was not what I expected it to be. This anime - despite it's outer appearance - is DEEP! When I started watching I sincerely thought I was going to drop this anime, but I stuck with it until episode 4 and my god I am glad that I did.\r\nStory ~ 8\r\nThis anime wasn't really reliant on a story if that makes any sense. If anything it felt as if the story was only there to create character complexes or build them up. The basic thing about the story is that all of the main cast (bar two) suffered/have sufferedfrom what is known as 'second-grade syndrome' (chuunibyou) which pushes aside reality and replaces it with a fantasy world. Of course, some characters have a reason for resorting to this, so the story revolves around a girl with this 'syndrome' called Rikka as she is encouraged to accept reality. \\n\\n\r\nArt ~ 9\\n\r\nDamn this art was cute. The scenery was so beautiful as well, making it seem like something ethereal as the characters do sometimes suggest. Although I did notice (I know this is anime but hear me out) the characters have HUGE tears. I'm surprised they haven't rigged them up to the town's water supply.\\n\\n\r\nSound ~ 8\\n\r\nThe music is infectious, you can't help but sing along with the opening and ending themes god damn it! *slams fist on table* The OST is also epic, from the battle music to the sad scene scores. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter ~ 10 \\n\r\nBEST THING ABOUT THIS ANIME!!! All of the characters are remarkable and deep and just so likable! They had me laughing and crying the whole way through. Rikka will make me cry and when you start to watch you will call me a fool, BUT YOU SHALL SEE HUMAN! I think the characters are rather realistic and portray really well how we can wish to fall out of humanity and into worlds of magic and no limit to possibility, but some of them believe they are always in it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment ~ 9 \\n\r\nSo many references and jokes in this anime, it really kept me on my toes. I felt very involved in the main plot of this anime, and the whole thing kind of felt like a well rounded story (I guess it is but WITHIN the story it felt like a story) because of the quirky style of narration used. You'll get what I mean when you watch it and you'll either love it or find it cheesy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is a very moving coming of age story (I guess that's the term) that I feel everyone should watch as it's overall message is acceptance of yourself, no matter how weird!",

            "content": "Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai is an anime that I think almost every anime fan who has grown up watching anime should watch. Why? It's nostalgic of our early years. It reminds us of how immature and cheesy we were as kids, when we thought that we could perform magical spells, transform into mechas, or sign hand seals for that powerful jutsu. It reminds us that those were not only cringeworthy moments, but also moments where we can look back and see how much we have grown from those innocent kids. So, without further ado, here's my review for this anime. \r\nTogashi Yuuta is aregular boy entering high school with a somewhat dark past. Back in middle school, he imagined himself as the Dark Flame Master, a powerful being who controlled dragons and flames. With the sudden realization that such delusions were uncool, he is determined to leave all of that behind in middle school and start afresh in a totally new high school where no one knows him. \\n\\n\r\nEnter Takanashi Rikka. An eccentric girl who is plagued by the same delusions that Yuuta once had. By an off chance, Rikka finds out about Yuuta's past as the Dark Flame Master, and using this as leverage, blackmails him into going along with her crazy ideas and stories. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the basic story of Chuunibyou. The adventures of these two kids and their friends make it weird, wonderful and fun. The pacing is slow at times, but every moment is worth it. You learn to see the world from the eyes of an innocent child again. You see that the world used to be much simpler, and that you miss the childhood that you once had. That's what this anime is. A lot of nostalgia packed into a season. But in no way is that bad. It makes for very pleasurable viewing for the fan. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is definitely moe, and in all honesty, I'm actually pretty fond of it. The color palettes are soft but vibrant. The characters have decent designs, even if they are somewhat bland. At some crucial moments in the anime, the backgrounds actually enhance the scene to greater heights. So overall, there's actually not much to complain about the art itself. \\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest. I absolutely loved Rikka's voice. It had the air of innocence, playfulness, and an absolute boisterousness that made me fall in love with the character, even if she was absolutely cringeworthy with her delusions. In all honesty, the voice actors really did their job well, and that's the main reason I'm giving the sound an 8/10. The voice actors did their job splendidly. You absolutely cannot expect anything better from them. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters have clearly defined personalities. Yuuta, who regrets his past, but has become a responsible teenager dedicated to bettering himself and focuses on enjoying his high school life as much as possible, without as much interruptions from Rikka and her antics as  possible. Rikka, who enjoys her life in the moment and doesn't care about what other people think about her. Nibutani, who faced a similar development to Yuuta, etc. All of them are interconnected by the one defining concept of this anime, which is childish imagination. But there isn't stagnation. Absolutely not. The characters, mostly the main few, develop from who they were in the beginning of the series, and move forward to a path which takes them towards adulthood. And that's what this anime is, the growing pains of a teenager trying to become an adult, whether they want to or not. It's an awkward phase, as most of us have endured ourselves. But if there's a point that I took away from the anime, it's this. Just because it's an awkward phase, doesn't mean it's not fun. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the series a lot, and still go back and rewatch it at times. It's a series which reminds us all that there is good in the world, and within each of us. It tells us not to lose our childish selves just because we all have to grow up. Age is just a number, and you're only as old as you think you are. At the time of writing this review, I remember reading that there will be a third season for this anime, which left me pleasantly, but anxiously surprised. I do hope that the third season turns out to be as good as the first two were.",

            "content": "Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai is hard for me to place for how much I like it. The reason for this is everything it wants to do, it seems to do competently. However, much of what I see is just that, competent. I think I'll organize this in what was done great, what was competent, and then what has me worried (since they didn't really do anything bad).\r\nFor what was great, right off the bat I have to talk about those crisp and nice animations. What impressed me about Slow Start's animations earlier in the year impressed me here almost just as much. They flowwell, and these characters don't make these cardboard cutout repeated movements. It really makes the fights, the jokes, and the interaction just that much more organic. It contributed so much to the characters, it's why both Art and Character get an 8 from me. Top this off with some really decent comedy, and this show starts off really strong.\\n\\n\r\nFor competence, I feel the story handled itself really well in two ways. I kinda expected the progression of the plot from the beginning (don't worry no spoilers), simply because the plot of \"why is someone deluded\" is done so often. Past that the second area that this show did well was avoiding too many tropes. The characters that feel like cliches are shown to be abnormal in their \"normal\" world, and I even had characters that I disliked but even felt like I understood. The musical score didn't blow me away, but it was coherently placed for what was onscreen. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, what really worries me about this show is kinda moving into Season 2 territory. A lot of character development happened this season, and as I'm about to start Season 2 I'm worried that they could undo some of this character development. I don't believe they will, but they're in a precarious position that has me a bit worried. All in all, the show is definitely worth your time if you're looking for a cute romantic story, that also grounds itself in some sort of reality that many high school anime don't have.",

            "content": "Pop Quiz: Which anime makes you laugh, makes you cry, and has teenagers mercilessly fighting each other with giant weapons and explosive magic? No, it\u2019s not Kill la Kill. Its Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!\r\nThere is something about Chuunibyou that is really special. There are many comedy/romance anime about kids in high school, and some of these anime are quite masterful. But Chuunibyou goes somewhere that these other anime do not. Most of the time, the struggle that our character\u2019s face has something to do with coming of age. \u201cWhat are we going to do when we graduate?\u201d \u201cHow is our romantic relationship going toprogress?\u201d The thing that is different about Chuunibyou is that the main characters aren\u2019t teens struggling to become adults. They are actually teens struggling to stop being kids!   \\n\\n\r\nAt first, Chuunibyou is kind of strange. Some of the characters have suffered from chuunibyou, or, \u201cMiddle School 2nd Year Syndrome.\" Yeah, I had never heard of that either. Basically, when they were kids, they pretended like they had super powers and superhero-like aliases. It\u2019s kinda like cosplaying. The story follows the misadventures of two of these children (now teenagers) in particular: Rikka Takanashi and Yuuta Togashi. While Yuuta is a boy who has given up his childish tendencies, of which he is now embarrassed by, Rikka still clings to the power of her \u201cWicked Eye\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nSomething I like about the Chuunibyou is that it has a moderate cast size considering its length, but the characters all seem fresh and creative. Some may disagree, but I don\u2019t think any of the characters immediately identify with any particular trope. That being said, there were a couple things about them that did bother me, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to discuss these problems without first discussing the characters themselves. \\n\\n\r\nFirstly, I\u2019ll discuss Yuuta and Rikka some more. The relationship between those two are the core of Chuunibyou. Just to reiterate, Yuuta has just given up on his old persona just before his new classmate, Rikka, comes into his life. Yuuta has no obvious incentive to befriend her other than being her classmate. Oh, and they\u2019re neighbors! Yeah, I think they might have borrowed that from Toradora!, but it\u2019s not a big deal. Although Chuunibyou has no immediate conflict, we see conflict arise as Yuuta and Rikka get closer.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the rest of the cast is pretty straight forward. There are few school girls that float around our main pair, a male best friend for Yuuta, and some relatives of both Yuuta and Rikka. Here, I\u2019ll discuss my problems with the cast. First of all, there is this girl named Shinka Nibutani that I think painfully resembles a character from Toradora! named Ami Kawashima. If you haven\u2019t seen Toradora!, that probably won\u2019t bother you, but it bothers me. Also, I won\u2019t tell you why they are alike as to not spoil anything. The second problem I have is with a character named Sanae Dekomori. Although she is clearly distinct from the rest of the cast, her defining characteristics almost replicate the alter-ego side of Rikka. The way Rikka acts when she is in cosplay mode is essentially the way Sanae acts. I wouldn\u2019t call that \u201ccheating\u201d or anything, but I feel like it takes away her potential to stand out among the cast. Aside from those two things, I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with the other characters. Also, I need to give a shout out to Yuuta\u2019s best friend Makoto, as I usually see characters like him being little more than the comic-relief punching bag.\\n\\n\r\nNow, remember what I said in the very first sentence of the review? You see, when some of the characters embrace their inner chuunibyou, they have these intense battle sequences. You\u2019ll see them fighting each other with guns, giant hammers, great swords, and explosive spells. Then, what\u2019s on the screen will change to them hitting each other with a kitchen utensil or an umbrella. After that, it will go back to the SAO-level action sequence. The glorious battle on the screen is all in their imagination! Not only is this a super creative idea, but the visuals get pushed to the limit. All the art would be at least passable without these scenes, but Chuunibyou goes beyond what is expected.\\n\\n\r\nSound wise\u2026yeah, its good. The soundtrack isn\u2019t Chuunibyou\u2019s focal point or anything, but it certainly sounds just fine. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I have some final thoughts about the story. Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! does a really good job at being a romance and a comedy. Its always funny, but it does an excellent job of letting the fun step aside in the latter portions of the show. I shouldn\u2019t talk about the romance itself, but it\u2019s there, and it is balanced very well as Chuunibyou progresses.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is an excellent school romance/comedy that leaves its own little touch on the genre. Its small length compounded with its entertainment value is certainly worth noting, and it certainly deserves a place on your shelf.\\n",

            "content": "I don't know why I've put this review off for so long, perhaps it's because I really wanted to focus and do it justice? Nothing left to do but dive right in...\r\nFor those unaware (me at first), \"Chuunibyou\" is defined in the anime as a term that means (paraphrased) middle school disease or syndrome. This can manifest in different ways, but in this series, it refers to a sort of extreme LARPing obsession where it bleeds into real life more than your typical fantasy nerd stuff does stateside. Someone can think they are indwelt by a demon spirit or harness some ancient power that \"commoners\"just can't handle or understand. It is typically viewed as something childish or delusional by the non-chuunibyou folks. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a decent story, so I don't want to ruin anything. We start off with Yuta having come fresh out of hardcore chuunibyou and wanting to leave it behind him now that he's in high school. His plans slowly unravel as he meets Rikka, a girl deeply steeped in chuunibyou. There is far more to it than just their interaction, it unfurls into a genuinely moving and emotional story. There are many \"sweet\" moments where it will tug at even the most resilient heartstrings. It has much more structure than a typical SoL anime does, I personally refer to this as a \"club\" anime, where the binding glue for the group is a school club theme. It has an actual story arc unlike Azumanga Daioh or Lucky Star, so idk if this could really be put in the same category. The closest I could compare this to is Kuragehime (out of the animes I've seen/reviewed), but I'll cover the visual differences below. The storyline for this is obviously more youthful since Kuragehime is set in post-high school, so while it may seem a tad more immature it suits the setting for the characters. All in all it's a great storyline, but it didn't quite move me enough to earn a 10. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is intensely awesome. It's crisp and well done, plus the \"chuunibyou footage\" is just plain awesome. The contrast between it and regular footage is just great and a very fun effect. For humor AND for setting mood/perspective it works great. These parts can get you excited and mix things up a bit, plus when the \"special effects\" get revealed it's pretty funny as well. Great show to look at and very entertaining, so the art earns a solid 10 in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the second one that I've reviewed based on the subbed version instead of a dub. It's hard to tell, but nothing stands out as particularly bad or annoying (though Dekomori can go overboard sometimes). Music's not bad either, but I wouldn't call it mind blowing.  Not much to say on this for me, other than it seems to be good, but not phenomenal. \\n\\n\r\nLike with most anime I like, the characters are a huge drive for the show and what make me like it. Yuta is the main protagonist and isn't a bad one at that. He's a nice guy and you can understand where he's coming from and what his motivations are. He may come off a little cookie cutter, but I feel the premise itself carries a lot of weight and he does well interacting with the other characters. The \"Dark Flame Master\" bits he does and his voice are pretty funny, definitely like those. Rikka's our main gal and she's certainly interesting. At first you're going to find her annoying, but after a while you come to love her and all her crazy little quirks. There's no series without her and you wouldn't want to even see anything like that happen. Nibutani is the opposite of Rikka, you start off liking her and will PROBABLY lose your like for her after that. She becomes a bit more tolerable later on, but she shows her true colors eventually and that's the worst time to deal with her. She redeems herself later on and you can see how she is very necessary. Her interaction with Dekomori is nothing short of hilarious. Kumin is a kind of bland character in this season of the show, mainly because we just don't hear much from her. She has a funny schtick to her, but it keeps us from really getting to know her. She's an ok character for what she is. Saving the best for last, you are a total dingus if you don't love Dekomori. She's over the top, but you wouldn't have her any other way. Her and Nibutani are one of the best comedic pairs I've seen in anime and it gets even better in the second season. Without Dekomori, there really wouldn't be much of a Nibutani presence. Fun, energetic, and never short of words...Dekomori is best waifu :p\\n\\n\r\nSo as far as watching and enjoying this anime, I have to say it's one of the most fun to watch that I've seen. Since they do have the ability to do cliffhangers given that there's a story arc, I found this one much harder to put down than others. Just like with Kuragehime, I kept going \"Uggghh....ok just ONE more episode...\". I can't really rate it for repeat entertainment, but I can definitely say I enjoyed it the first time through. I felt the ending was great and exactly what it needed to close things off. However...it's NOT the end once this season is done!!! XD\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you want something with more story arc depth than a SoL set in high school, but want a feel-good \"club anime\" that will get you laughing, this is the place to look. The \"chuunibyou footage\" can satisfy the desires of some of the fantasy/action addicts while giving you the elements of having a realistic storyline and good character development. It's definitely a comedy and has some strong romantic elements, but I feel it's done tastefully. The drive of the story wasn't bad, just wasn't as strong as I felt the reactions of the characters needed to be justified. This one is just short of perfect, definitely worth a watch!!!",

My involvements with the slice of life genre are Clannad, Anohana, Haruhi, Kimi no Na wa, and K-On! And, I can tell you with full certainty that this series is strictly worse than all of those. I know my experience in the genre skews my view on this series, but I'd have to call it below average. The main character Rikka is the only redeemable factor ofthe anime and she does an outstanding job at carrying the entire series on her shoulders, but there's only so much a single character can do. The plot is lackluster and every other character is as forgettable as the title. The visuals are amazing though. Watch one or two episodes and if you fall in love with Rikka like I did, keep watching it. Otherwise go watch something better.",

            "content": "Ahh, \"Eight-Grade Syndrome\". I'm pretty sure more of us have experienced this so-called syndrome back when we were in middle school. I definitely did. I used to run like a ninja. My body lowered and hands on my back while I was running. Ugh..Thinking back to that event makes me want to take my shoe-laces off and strangle myself until I pass out. \r\n[Story]: (8/10)\r\nYuuta Togashi suffered from a syndrome called \"Eight-Grade Syndrome\" or \"Chuunibyou\". Now, a high school freshman..Too embarrassed, he tries to forget  about his past until a certain someone came into contact with him that also has Chuunibyou even to thisday. \\n\\n\r\nA crazy girl unknowingly drags the main protagonist into her crazy world...What does that remind you of? It's an anime made by the same studio. That's right, \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\". The first couple of episodes are just so similar. Does this mean Chuunibyou is a rip off of Haruhi? No! Definitely not! The concept of both shows are hugely different. \\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, the show will make you cringe....but not in a bad way and at the same time, will make you laugh due to the expressions that they make when they are reminded of their unforgettable past. Rikka and Dekemori acting like some RPG/fantasy characters is just....it makes me cringe to the max. There were times where I had to face down, cover my face and laugh at how stupid these 2 girls look. Them acting like a typical nerd is what makes the show good in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nIf you've suffered from a Chuunibyou before, like I did, then you will definitely know what the characters are feeling and why they're rolling on the floor and banging their heads to try and forget their embarrassing past. Although, the latter is greatly exaggerated but you get why they're doing it. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the anime is basically a high school slice-of-life. The main protagonist \"joins\" the club along with the girl who's suffering from a \"Chuunibyou\". Along the way, a bunch of characters gets introduced who will later join the club. Each characters that was introduced have some rather...unique personality. For example, Kumin, one of the characters who joined Rikka's club, loves sleeping. She even brings her pillow along. Another example is Nibutani, one of the nicest and cutest student in the class, holds that image because of her embarrassing Chuunibyou past. The first half contains one of the funniest scenes in the show. The first part of the comedy is the Chuunibyou part which I already talked about above. The second part of the comedy is also pretty funny in my opinion. For example, Dekomori and Nibutani's constant argument/fighting. I just love the character dynamics between the two and their constant fighting always made me laugh. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the anime has a plot. It's more of a Romantic plot. The comedy in the second half is reduced significantly, the atmosphere gets serious and the show gets more dramatic. While I thought that the first half of the show was more superior, the 2nd half wasn't that great but it is still pretty good. The problem with the 2nd half is the sudden change in tone. The first half's atmosphere was fun and lighthearted then the 2nd half suddenly changes into something dramatic and serious. I mean, I watched the show expecting Chuunibyou and comedy which I got in the first half. I wasn't expecting the sudden change in tone in the 2nd half at all. There has to be a process if you want to switch from comedy to drama. You can't just switch the tone of the series in 1 episode. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I do love in the 2nd half is the character development of Rikka. The second half focused on Rikka's Chuunibyou and why she has it in the first place. I feel like KyoAni did a great job presenting why Rikka had a Chuunibyou. It's not something that you should cry about but you should feel sympathetic for her. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nIf I see an anime made by Kyoto Animation, I will immediately watch it due to their beautiful and glorious animation. Hell, that's the whole reason why I watched Chuunibyou in the first place. I didn't bother researching about this anime. The animation for Chuunibyou is consistent, smooth, and it's beautiful. Most of the consistent and smooth animation that I'm talking about comes from the Chuunibyou battle scenes. The battle scenes are just so smooth and I detected no choppiness whatsoever. The character design looks great which is to be expected. The background also looks crisp. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe OST's are simple amazing..I'm not talking about the soundtrack that plays during the slice-of-life scenes. I'm talking about the soundtrack that plays during the Chuunibyou battle scenes. It keeps you engaged while watching the battle scenes. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Sparkling Daydream\" by ZAQ and the ED theme song is \"INSIDE IDENTITY\" by Rikka Takanashi, Shinka Nibutani, Kumin Tsuyuri, and Sanae Dekomori. The OP theme song is not a great song but it is pretty catchy. I also love the seizure-inducing OP animation. The ED theme song is average and not worth mentioning. \\n\\n\r\nI don't usually review voice actors for reasons you don't need to know but for this one, I really do. I watched the show in English Dub and all I can say is the dub is decent but not great. It's once again one of Sentai's dub where they are known for decent to below average dubs. I do want to point out Kumin's English VA. Her voice just sounds so moe and cute. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nKyoto Animation never ceases to amaze when it comes to their characters. Whether that character is a moe, an airhead, a sleepy little girl, a girl who gets angry at the main protagonist, an annoying female girl and etc..I, for whatever reason, still like those characters. I mean, I still like Sanae Dekomori and I think she's funny even though she's the most annoying character in the series. Now, the main characters...\\n\\n\r\nYuuta Togashi, the main protagonist of the series and a person who suffered from Chuunibyou. I gotta admit, this guy is not much of an idiot. He's just your typical high school kid except he wants to forget his embarrassing past. Then there's Rikki Takanashi, a girl who is currently \"suffering\" from a Chuunibyou. She wears an eye patch..thus, I see her as a loser. A cute loser girl. Honestly, I love the character dynamic between Rikka and Dekomori because they annoy the hell out of me (I meant that in a good way) and they makes me laugh like a retard. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Sanae Dekomori, a middle school girl with an extremely long pig-tailed hair which she uses as a \"weapon\". Like I said above, I like her and I think she's one of the best character in the series but she extremely annoys the hell out of me. Her Chuunibyou is just worse than Rikka. Then there's Shinka Nibutani. She's quite similar to Yuuta. She also suffered from a Chuunibyou and now she's just trying to be a normal high school student, just like Yuuta. She's an average character and her argument/fight with Dekomori always cracks me up. Finally, there's Kumin Tsuyuri, a girl who loves to sleep all day. I can kind of relate to Kumin. I also sleep in class every single day and my teachers don't give a shit except I don't bring a pillow like she does. I also love her cute innocent voice. \\n\\n\r\nRikka Takanashi actually got a major character development in this series and I was quite surprised. I mean, I thought this was going to be a slice-of-life series featuring a girl with a Chuunibyou just because...reasons but there's actually a deep and painful reasoning why she has a Chuunibyou in the first place.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\\n\r\nI wasn't expecting to enjoy this series. The only reason why I wanted to watch this anime is because it was made by Kyoto Animation. The show is extremely funny, the show will make you remember your embarrassing past if you've ever suffered from a Chuunibyou and the romance between Yuuta and Rikka is pretty good.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shita\" is a great high school anime series that focuses on Chuunibyou and how embarrassing it is. While the show did a great job on the comedy and the characters, especially the character development for Rikka, the 2nd half felt a bit too weak and I felt like the drama wasn't executed properly. However, this anime is a must watch..especially for the fans of Kyoto Animation. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.5/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Great \"Chuunibyou\" concept\\n\r\n+Likable Female Characters\\n\r\n+Amazing Battle themes\\n\r\n+Major Character Development for Rikka and Great explanation behind her Chuunibyou\\n\r\n+Pretty Good Romance\\n\r\n+Beautiful and Smooth Animation\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-2nd half felt a bit too weak\\n\r\n-Sudden change in tone",

            "content": "Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! really surprised me. I was expecting the usual high school harem comedy but got something completely different.\r\nThe story is based around the syndrome of chuunibyou where school children create a fantasy world around them to escape their unhappiness of the real world. We are introduced to Yuuta Togashi who to escape his chuunibyou as the Dark Flame Master starts at a high school where nobody knows him. Unfortunately he meets Rikka, who is still in the middle of her chuunibyou, who sees him give the Dark Flame Master one last outing and becomes contracted to him and calls him DarkFlame Master in front of everybody. To make it worse she is also his neighbour. We are then introduced to Shinka Nibutani who like Yuuta is trying to escape her chuunibyou and Sanae Dekomori who is enjoying hers and also Kumin Tsuyuri who likes to sleep.\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! really begins as a very good comedy with lots of slapstick humour. However, when we get to the obligatory beach episode the series really comes into its own. Instead of lots of fan service and being no more than a filler episode, the series becomes more serious and we find the cause of Rikka's chuunibyou and unhappiness.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say I enjoyed the characters. The humour worked well with them and whats more for a change in anime they actually looked like school kids. Each character adds something to the story making it easier to empathise with them.\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is a highly enjoyable and funny anime with a great story.",

            "content": "Chuunibyou was an anime that kept following me for like half a year. I was hyped when I was recommended this series but for many different reasons I wouldn't watch it. And it lasted for like 6 months before I finally decided to do it.\r\nI will do my best to avoid spoilers but some things can only be explained with minor ones.\r\nAs allways let's start with the story - there is a guy who was into cosplaying and role-playing in his middle school and when he went to high school he wanted all of it to end - to leave his past behind him. Butcan he really be able to do it when he meets a girl from his class that has the Chuunibyou syndome like he used to?\\n\r\nYou can treat this as a romance or comedy, both is fine but for me it's a comedy with romance elements not the other way around. And there is also something it lacks in the romance department. I liked how the story was about Rika submerging in her delusional world and Yuuta trying to make her get a grasp on reality but at the same time understanding what it's like to be in that world. There are some really heartwarming scenes that get you excited and waiting for more, there is only one problem there - there is no followup. So it builds up pretty well and leaves you waiting for more... until you realize the story has already finished.\\n\\n\r\nAs for art I would give it a 9 - it's a common modern days art style which is good by itself but there are also some really nice scenes - i.e. a city scenery in the night being lit up by it's lights which looks nice but what you can really have some fun watching are the fight scenes in the delusional world. I find them to be pretty awesome, incredibly excesive but amazing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters I find it that I liked most of them.\\n\\n\r\nOur main male lead is likeable enough, you can really feel that he wants to leave his previous life behind him and become a \"normal\" high school guy and you root for him. His interactions with other characters is also something I really really enjoyed. There are some awkard moments sure but in general I must say it is one of the characters that I enjoyed the most out of many anime I have seen (except for 1 or 2 scenes towards the ending but no spoilers here). To be honest I actually wanted to watch him play his delusional role a lot more because it was just so great. My only hope is that he will play the role of Dark Flame Master more often in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nFemal lead - Rikka, a girl who lives inside her delusions, owner od the Cursed Eye and in reality - just a girl who can't cope with reality so she runs away to the world of dreams. Let's be honest now we all faced situations we didn't want to remember right? So did she, only that she couldn't cope with it so much that she had to create her own world that would shield her. Also - she's hilarious, and cute too. There is only one moment where she made me pretty angry but I understood why she did it, I knew it was the right thing to do, yet I know she shouldn't have done it. I'm sure you'll realize what I mean once you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for our supporting cast - I am still grinning now whenever I think about Kumin falling asleep everyplace possible (some impossible too) and Ishiski trying to confess his feelings over and over and failing miserably every single time. Dekomori and Shinka rivalry keeps me spinning too at least in the beginning. For the first half of the anime I really liked it but for the second, it somehow wasn't fun for me anymore (I mean mostly Dekomori here, Kumin and Ishiki are awesome the entire time).\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up - I had lots of fun watching this series and I'm really hyped for the second season, I'm pretty sure this time I won't let it hang for half a year before picking it up - more like watching it from day 0. It was a really enjoying story with lots of humour with just one capital offence that I will not forgive - what on earth is with a romance story where the characters never even kiss? I was waiting for this kiss the entire time... There was one really sweet scene when they hugged and I loved it all through. But come on - not even a kiss on the cheek.",

Furthermore the series\u2019 climax leaves it well rounded yet open to development should the producers wish to create a second season. This harem will almost certainly have you shipping harder than the average sailor!",

            "content": "Chuunibyou had been the highlight of the 2012 fall season for me. For me it has resonated with me a decent bit, as I have experienced (and continue experiencing) \"eighth grader syndrome\" myself. Chuunibyou is essentially possessing an overactive imagination to the extent that you will superimpose your own delusions in reality. Why do people contract Chuunibyou? Is it a disease, or just a piece of ones personality? Should we really attempt to become completely normal? Does everyone not have their own unique 'chuunibyou' experience at one point in their life?\r\n Yuuta, our male lead, experienced his chuunibyou as dark flame master. After proceeding torealize how much he regrets his eight grader actions he attempts to transfer to a school where nobody will recognize him. Unfortunately, he runs into a ninth grader stuck in her eight grade syndrome who has discovered his secret past. Thus chaos ensues as the 'recovered' Yuuta and the 'sick' Rikka enter a strange friendship.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a relatively lighthearted comedy for the most part, as Yuuta who sympathizes with Rikka's situation tries to open her eyes with little progress. Rikka ends up forming a supernatural (and nap) club, gathering an eight grader Dekomori, wielding sand bags at the end of her twin tails, whom worships the other member with the nickname Forest Summer. Their senpai kumin really only enjoys napping, but joins their club so they have enough members.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a few episodes that tend to be on the comedy side, chuunibyou switches over to start exploring the feelings between the characters, and the feelings between reality and imagination.  I felt that the drama never appeared over the top, and the situation was simple. It was well executed allowing you to sympathize well with the characters, but at the same time not feel depressed yourself. I thought that the drama and comedy paired together nicely, to make a very enjoyable viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed chuunibyou as it mixed comedy with meaning. As anime lovers, at least I assume you are, we all tend to have more of an overactive imagination or in comparison to others. Well I haven't actually had an imaginary battles with my friends since I was small, yet chuunibyou shows that letting your creativity run wild is a very important part of growing up. I also love romance and drama, so my tastes for those were well satisfied too! I would definitely recommend this anime to just about anyone as I think the target audience is extremely broad. That means you reader!\\n",

            "content": "Hey Guys, this is my first Review from the First Anime that has influenced me to walk in the Otaku Path and see the marvelous things that Anime has to offer. Well enough with this. Let's talk about what you guys are Looking for.\r\nWhat is Chuunibyou About? You probably read the synopsis so there's no reason to explain that ofcourse! But to say in short what it's basically about to give you an idea.  Growing up is a part of what every teenagers needs to do. Leaving your childish embarrassing ways behind and start an average normal teenage live. Well it didn't go exactlylike that at all with our male protagonist Yuuta, bumping into contact with Rikka has made that \"normal lifestyle dream\" come to ruin. Just when yuuta wants to leave all his shameful things that he did behind, Rikka's behaviour reminds yuuta exactly how he was!\\n\\n\r\nGenres? Comedy, Drama, Romance, School, Slice of Life... Each one of these fits very well with the Anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to romance, the relationships grows as the show progresses. Season 2 of this anime is airing 9th of January if i'm not mistaken so for those who love romance and comedy, i'm sure season 2 would go even deeper in that. Don't worry, you'll be satisfied with the romance and comedy in season 1 :) nothing to worry about. This anime has pretty cute romance developing and it's very hilarious with the 8th grader syndrome in which Rikka and Dekomori both have. Their probably the main reasons why you're going to laugh allot :P\\n\\n\\n\r\nDrama? Personally in my opinion, a good romance must have a good drama that leads to character development. Or else it makes it boring. Not saying that romance without drama is immediately bad though. But you have an idea what i mean.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story Line is pretty much allright. Nothing  much of a mystery or something to get you excited. Though it gives you an idea that Yuuta's everyday \"normal\" lifestyle will be changed by a girl with the name Rikka. What makes it awesome is the romance (for those who love romance), and pretty much surely the comedy obviously and the touch of serious drama in it. \\n\\n\r\nTo say in short, The anime is pretty much well balanced in regards to romance, comedy and drama. \\n\r\nIt has it's flaws or in areas where it did not meet your expectations/satisfaction. However, this was a great enjoyable Anime.\\n\r\nRomance Lovers? Comedy Lovers? You'll enjoy this anime decently. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nPersonally, each character helped in making the Anime entertaining and awesome. Kumin Tsuyuri (Girl who loves to sleep), Rikka and Sanae Dekomori (Rikka's underling lol) who both has the 8th grader syndrome, Nibutani (the popular girl in school) and our main protagonist who has the most funniest reaction when being reminded about his past self xD \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7  (alright\\n\r\nArt: 10 (Loved the Art)\\n\r\nSound: 10 (Nice)\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 (enjoyed it allot)\\n\r\nOverall: 9 (great)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The characters are wonderful. Yuuta, our male lead, has voice acting that feels slightly off. Rikka, the female lead, has a very normal female voice, which wouldn't be a good thing for most characters, but really matches well when the character flips suddenly between regular teenage girl to her persona, and helps deliver those wonderful deadpan lines. The opening theme's music was ok, if forgettable, but the imagery was nice, and stuck with me. The ending theme isn't bad in and of itself, the music's rock beat fitting more into the imaginary fighting. However, the lyrics hint at some deeper themes the show goes intolater on, just not enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nAfter having finished the series, I find myself having enjoyed it remarkably. However, I don't believe it to be overly special. Let's start with the good, then go to the bad.\\n\\n\r\nGood\\n\r\nAll the main characters have good personalities that seem much more than stereotypes. I won't spoil anything but early on I was very pleasantly surprised by a minor twist in a character's personality. What was originally a bland, basic character become very much so 3D. However, minor characters are often very bland, able to be described in one word.\\n\r\nThe action scenes, while imaginary, are wonderful. It seems like the studio making these decided to say \"Heck with it\" and fully animated the pretend fighting, which later in the series provided some incredibly powerful imagery.\\n\r\nThe romance, while I'm sure some would disagree, I personally very much so enjoyed. As I only watched the first twelve episodes, but I feel the \"ships\", or relationships, weren't bad. The main two character's relationship in particular is very easy to root for, but it IS a romance anime, so that's a necessity.\\n\r\nThis anime captured day dreams and imagination impeccably, which only made it funnier when it's played for laughs by showing what they're ACTUALLY doing.\\n\r\nThe jokes where definitely there and I had to stop myself from laughing too loudly sometimes, pausing the video so I could actually hear it.\\n\\n\r\nBad\\n\r\nOne main character was a very big miss for me, so any scene with her in it was made worse. She wasn't the worst, she just struck me as unnecessary and detrimental to the plot.\\n\r\nThe message at the end of the show seems to get confused in itself a bit, and I'm left wondering whether or not I actually agree with it, seeing as it brought up a good argument against itself\\n\\n\r\nMixed\\n\r\nThis show occasionally suffers from \"The Rule of the Status Quo\". What I mean is, the show will ignore events sometimes just to have the characters all still meet up at their hang out place. It feels a bit forced sometimes, leaving me asking \"Why did this character come back here at a time like this?\" The answer, because the story demanded it.\\n\r\nThis will sound strange, but I think there shouldn't have been anymore. Sure there's more story to tell, but that ending was fine be me. Yet I'm not sad there's more as I really enjoyed the characters and wanted to continue this journey with them.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSummary/TL:DR: I had several complaints, but honestly, what got me through were the two main characters, and that's what's important here. Overall, this was a very good anime. We're not reaching Log Horizon levels, or, dare I say, fullmetal alchemist, but this was incredibly enjoyable. Now, I'm going to go start the second season as I'm craving more, however it is it's own beast, I'm sure, so I'll save it for another review.",

A more accurate translation (from kissanime.com, and, coincidentally, also under 'Synonyms') is: Despite my adolescent delusions of grandeur, I want a date!\r\nAnd that is exactly what it is - pretty much a romantic comedy that has a lot of, well, romance, or at least wills ofromantic relationships. And, once again despite the title, these extend to all characters, not only the main one and even less only the ones who suffer from \u2018chuunibyou\u2019 - otherwise known as \u2018eighth grade symptom\u2019 or the titular adolescent delusions of grandeur. There\u2019s no real magic, in any case - which is what the title and cover art lead me to believe, but that is really my own fault more than anyone else\u2019s.\\n\r\nAt a first glance, it\u2019s a regular slice of life and there\u2019s really nothing special about it. It\u2019s a barely-there plot line stacked with fluff. Apart from the fact that it was most I had laughed with an anime in a while (indeed, I found the humour quite acceptable, as opposed to many other anime that I have seen recently), nothing was particularly interesting. In fact, I didn\u2019t particularly like it because, as far as I was concerned, the episodes were further split into different parts and progressed through \u2018arcs\u2019 of events - which I had already gotten enough of with Bakemonogatari. I guess that is a bit of characteristic of slice of life anime though. The romance had no\u2026 element of surprise, you could call it. It was pretty much obvious who was going to fall in love with who - at least with the two main characters. Although that there is technically a whole class, there are actually only a few characters, and as such all the relationships are obviously going to be between them. And, as with most anime, there was a fair share of exaggerations (characters banging their heads/fists/whatever on the floor at an incredible speed; Tooka-san who constantly carries around a metal ladle, etc), time skips and, of course, the sob story. Lastly, since it is a slice of life, there wasn't much plot line. \\n\r\nAs it turns out, this anime is absolutely full of false first impressions. Despite the truly average beginning it grew into an anime that I thoroughly enjoyed. A little past halfway through, many more deeper themes show up in the background, and I absolutely loved this deeper meaning. This anime (surprisingly) deals a lot with growing up and, more importantly, coping with and accepting change, especially change that we do not wish to see. This is actually a topic that I can relate very well to, due to the fact that I do not like nor do I deal well with change.\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime very commendable in my eyes is that despite my hate for romance and slice of life, I still liked this anime - in fact, I got the pleasure of judging it good enough to add to my favourites list (something I never thought I would have at the start). \\n\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai is overall a light-hearted anime full of humour (even if they\u2019re not the best jokes, I still laughed a lot), and it really touched me close to heart. I really enjoyed it. Deathly so! \\n\r\nTaking into account it\u2019s flaws as well as good aspects, I have decided on a score of 8/10. It\u2019s great how such a simplistic plot line has been produced so well. Do keep in mind though that it IS a slice of life, so of course it's not going to have such a prominent plot line, as I said earlier. \\n\\n\r\nKyoto Animation obviously kept up to it\u2019s great standards. Whilst scenery wasn\u2019t the best I\u2019ve seen, it was still very pleasurable to the eye, and corresponded very well with the general feel of the anime, considering that it was quite realistic.\\n\r\nThe character art is one of the best I\u2019ve seen. The characters are not overly moe, but still manage to be absolutely adorable. The eyes are not huge and deformed like in the 5 minutes of an episode of Ouran High School Host Club that I saw a week or so ago on t.v. (sorry! Just had to bring it up!). \\n\r\nLastly, I love the contrast portrayed between the \u2018imaginary\u2019 world of the chuunibyous and reality. One of my favourite scenes was sometime in the first few episodes when the magic circle was set up - the initial blue light that shone up in true walls of light which turned out to be feeble blue LEDs, or the fight scenes in the chuunibyous\u2019 heads in contrast to reality. This has a little to do with the humour element, but I still really liked the visual aspect and changes of it. This further deepens when Rikka \u2018grows up\u2019 and loses her eyepatch - everything becomes less colourful, though not to an extreme measure.\\n\r\nIt\u2019s no surprise that this deserves a 9/10, since it was very pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was one of the aspects that I barely noticed in this anime. I guess I was a little too focused on what was going on to notice it. What I did manage to pick up was good, but by no means exceptional, music. The opening theme was one that I much preferred to skip rather than listen for a minute and a half. As it happens though, I enjoyed the ending theme more and more, though I don\u2019t entirely know what to think about in the global context of the anime. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the most fitting ED, but it doesn\u2019t stick out like a sore thumb either. \\n\r\nI really enjoyed the voice acting. The voices were very befitting of the characters. For instance, I thought that Dekomori\u2019s character was really accentuated by the way her voice was done, especially the \u2018des\u2019 in every one of her sentences. \\n\r\nUpon rewatching certain scenes, I realised just how beautiful the music really is. It would never compare to tracks in PMMM, but as a whole, it was great - 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a little hard to judge. On one hand, their personalities were, for some of the characters, somewhat predictable and shallow- the seemingly nice class rep who has a very mean side and does all to get on the good sides of the adults (to be simple, the double-faced popular girl), the soft, constantly sleeping senpai, the boy character who is much too obsessed with girls for his own good, and the disbelieving male protagonist. On the other hand, we have our two main chuunibyous, whose imaginations run wild and are absolutely full of quirks. After the first two episodes, I was so in love with Rikka that I decided I would add her to my favourites list. Upon meeting Dekomori, I couldn\u2019t decide who I loved more. This in itself could be interpreted as a flaw - it means that the two characters are very similar. Rikka\u2019s character does change during the course of the anime, though, but some of the changes are a little too brisk, and I wondered where her initial spunk had suddenly disappeared to. \\n\r\nIn the end, I really liked Dekomori because not only is she an adorable chuunibyou but I could relate to her very much. This kind of character will of course vary for everyone, but the fact that I found such a character in this anime was definitely a plus.\\n\r\nI came to realise that maybe I was just looking for aspects in the characters that are similar to other anime characters. I still believe that they do have some stereotypical aspects, but it\u2019s actually not that bad.\\n\r\nOverall, the characters are really amusing and entertaining despite being a little shallow and predictable, and each of them adds something to the show. And so, I give this aspect an 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly can\u2019t say much about enjoyment because I\u2019ve mentioned most of what I would say in previous paragraphs. But, let me summarise: despite my first impressions and my hatred for both romance and slice of life, this grew to an anime that I really enjoyed - so much that I was actually scared that I may just have to give it a 10 (at least at the spur of that moment). Overall, it\u2019s a lighthearted anime which does touch close to heart.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.2/10 (rounded to 8)\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nIf you click that button down there, please tell me why! :3",

He is bound to have a normal life.\\n\\n\r\nTakanashi Rikka is a neighbor and classmate of Togashi Yuuta and does still have the \"eight-grader-syndrome\". She wants to get Yuuta back in his \"eight-grader-syndrome\" and sometimes succeeds for a few minutes.\\n\\n\r\nNibutani Shinka is the class representative and also a cheerleader (with an enormous clip in her hair). Many people would think she is the perfect girl, but appearances are deceptive. She is tend to be annoyed pretty fast and has her evil sides. Either way, she is more or less in the same position as Yuuta, but I will not spoil how and why.\\n\\n\r\nTsuyuri Kumin is a nice (nice as in personality) girl who loves sleeping, she is a year older then Yuuta, but somehow got involved with Yuuta and Rikka (again I will not spoil it). She also quite fond of cats.\\n\\n\r\nDekomori Sanae is a girl with very long pigtails and is an \"underling\" of Rikka. She also has \"eight-grader-syndrome\" and is mainly the reason why a certain character is involved with Yuuta and Rikka. She also a year younger then Rikka and Yuuta, but is quite smart (at least in math).\\n\\n\r\nTsukomo Nanase is the homeroom teacher of Yuuta, Rikka and Shinka.\\n\r\nShe is sometimes a bit sadistic towards Rikka, but she is overall a kind person.\\n\\n\r\nTakanashi Touka is Rikka's older sister, and mainly the reason why I mention her is because she plays a bigger part in the story then Yuuta's family.\\n\r\nShe uses a ladle as a weapon against Rikka's crazy antics.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI really enjoy this anime, it gives me a good laugh and Rikka is just so cute throughout the series. The story is really unique and makes me think back to my \"eight-grader-syndrome\" (even though it was in seventh grade).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThis anime is a really good anime, especially when you enjoy comedy and romance.\\n\r\nThe anime can easily rise up to a 9 or even a 10 if it keeps this up.\\n\r\nThis anime is really worth watching, so I'd say: \"Give it a try! I'm sure you won't regret it.\"",

            "content": "*Spoiler Free Review*\r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is a masterpiece. Watching this anime was one of the most enjoyable experiences that I've had recently. I highly suggest that everyone gives this a watch.\r\nThe story is fantastic and has tons of hilarious quirky moments. It's overly cute in a good way, and this is coming from a male college student. The story also has tons of depth. I was surprised when suddenly the series punches you with tons of emotion and feels right in the gut. It's a great progression and it makes the series feel full and thought out. You'll laugh, you'll smile, you'll cry,and you'll go AWE!!! It has a full range of emotions and all of them are achieved greatly.  It's way more then just a comedy, get your tissues ready!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so lovable. Rikka is without a doubt one of the best characters in anime. Like I said in the story section, these characters put you through a wide range of emotions and it's all achieved with great character development. There wasn't one character that felt like it was in the way or just put there to be there. They all felt important and real. The design on the characters is beautiful and the animations are crisp and a work of art. \\n\\n\r\nI think this anime is a must watch for anyone. I can't really pin-point a reason as to why this anime wouldn't be for you, you just have to trust me and watch it. If you're thinking it might be too childish looking or too \"cute\" looking for your taste, just watch it anyway, you'll be happy. This anime earns my highest recommendation.  \\n\\n\r\nContent Rating - 13+ Mature Themes, Some Language, Some Violence",

            "content": "Chuunibyou is a social problem in Japan, and has been portrayed before those show came out by others authors like Satoshi Kon in Paranoia Agent. But only Kyoto Animation coud take something and turn it in a Moeblob OMG kawaii desuuuuu Party. Let's face it, a KyoAni show where the characters didn't look cute would be like a shoujo without bishonen. Something really weird, just because we get used to. \r\nThe story is the classic formula Boy has Secret-Girl discovers It. We've already seen it in Onani Master Kurosawa and Aku no Hana. But, what embarassing secret the male character has? He had chuunibiyou inmiddle school, and now he want to start again. The main problem with the plot and this character is despite is supposed to be the most embarassing and social humillating thing ever, we never seen any real bad consequences. He suffered bullying? Embarassed his family? His teachers told him to stop in a rude way because they were annoyed? The only real consequence is shown to us is self-isolation. A bad thing, of course, but don't think it woulde be enough to the reactions he shows when someone nearly discover it.\\n\r\nOne thing really surprise is how much the story reminds me to a Key's visual novel. Guy meets cute girl, and then the main character is surronded by girls, and we discover a melodramatic back-story. And there's childish humor, based in how clumsy the characters are. And there's a boy who is the male protagonist best friend, to show us the main character not just spend all his time with girls, that can't stop thinking about girls, and everybody beats him up for comedy's sake. I forgot something? The funniest thing is not based in a Key's visual novel. It's based in a light novel published by the editorial the studio owns, a common practice in KyoAni those days. That way, they had absolute control of what they want, how shows should be.\\n\r\nIt's not the only thing it looks this show rips-off. It looks like they're doing this because they can't do Arakawa under the bridge, the story about a japanese guy with a girlfriend she believes she came from Venus. The main characters reactiobns are so similar, that i think KyoAni wanted the same seiyuu to play the role, but they didn't manage to.\\n\\n\r\nThe trouble with this show is pretty simple. It could be a great social commentary and a beautiful coming of age story about growing up, but all the potential was buried because the show was made for the people who made it. Fortunetly for the show, people loves KyoAni formula: school club, moeblob female characters with standard personalities, episodes centered around school festivals and beach episodes. Everything is adorable, happy, upbeat, colorful, nothing risky, nothing that'll make the public uncomfortable. That's not a bad thing, people deserve show that will make you happy, but, like when you eat too much sweets and candy, is not healthy.",

Or better perhaps (Heavy) Humor, (Heavy) Romance, and (Heavy) Drama.\r\nAt the first few episode I just merely seeing this as a entertaining humorous anime with high school theme, but I am actually really surprised with the way story develop into a heavy matter of the heroine personal past.\r\nTo be honest, this is exceeding my expectation by FAR..like real far.\r\nThe episodes is really take my interest by its great humour and the way character react and over-react is really funny. And I really do entertain with their daily foolishness and delusions.\r\nThe story progressing and developin a really smooth way. It does a really good job transitioning from friendship to love relationship. And to get it even tastier, they put on top another icing on the cake, that humours.\\n\\n\r\nBut...just like a good food........there is saltiness and bitterness of the story that make the anime a WHOLE LOT different genre when you reach the few last episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI am personally love episodes 9-11 (I won't spoil you anything, and for the remarks the sound effect and background really hit me hard LOL. Koi!) because that's where I realised how thick the romance is, and how the story goes from light, to warm, and then going dark in a steady pace.\\n\\n\r\nWell...it is my taboo to talk too much in review since the more I talk the bigger chance I will spoil the story. So if by any means you are looking for anime with a LIGHT, WARMING, and DARK at the same time ....in the genre slice of life or high school themed.... it will suit you. \\n\\n\r\nLast...I never thought that this anime will develop its story in this way at all and it catch me by surprise by a lot.

I find that this anime is really relatable. I really enjoyed these episodes. \r\nIt also has the stupid things we do as teenagers. This anime has the perfect amount of cringiness vs romance and it honestly makes the episodes go by longer than what they actually are. \r\nI am actually amazed by this and I will be looking forward to watching the next season. Hopefully this anime will continue for season after season. \r\nWhat I also love is the kickof reality and growing up within it.",

Why? cause it was very funny, very pretty, and very cringey. \r\nWhile your cringe levels may vary, it will be cringtastic for anyone that has used to be a Chuunibyou, like myself. The fact that the MC is a guy trying to grow out of his Chuunibyou phase and all these people, who are still in it, try to bring him back, makes for a hilarious time. \r\nIn between funny moments, there is incredibly gif-able shots of main girl Rikka as well as some nicely animated pretend action scenes. \r\nThe story is a bit ofa harem anime however, there is a main love story throughout. Somewhere around the last few episodes the story lost me and never really turn around to pick me up. I will highly recommend it and you will know by the first ep. if this is a show for you.",

So of course I was a little put off to find that the genera is quite as prevalent as I was told it was, but besides this little issue it's great. Funny, cringey (in a good way), and even some what heart warming, and I love the art style. I'm probably going to end up watching it again at some point.",

            "content": "If I were to pick one superbly crafted, fantasy/slice of life romance anime - it would be this one. Rikka is a high school girl living as a Chunibyo, individuals that pretend that daily mundane aspects of their lives are actually magical, over exaggerated events to deal with the feeling go not fitting in. When Auto, a former a Chunibyo who is struggling to let go of his embarrassing past befriends Rikka, he realises that the Chunibyo may still be inside him too. This anime is random, fun, hilarious at times and the romance is actually really well done in this one. The pacing, thereactions\u2026everything.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is both ridiculously hilarious, yet also overwhelmingly sombre at times. We discover how Rikka became a Chunibyo and then go down the path of whether living in a fantasy world is actually a negative aspect of her identity. Should others be promoting a life in which Rikka is in denial, yet is ultimately happy? Yuta struggles with this issue the most because though he is no longer in his Chunibyo phase, he is still a kid that understands what an important part someone\u2019s fantasy world is to their identity. The adults in Rikka\u2019s family are trying to push her towards accepting some traumatic events, though Yuta is conflicted over whether this is really the right way to handle the situation\\n\\n\r\nSo Rikka and Yuto\u2019s relationship is the main factor which makes this anime so amazing. Yuto develops a bond with Rikka because he recognises his past embarrassing self within her, but over time, he grows to enjoy Rikka\u2019s antics and plays along. The caring, tender and supportive nature of Yuto\u2019s nature makes him seem like a dad (which I\u2019m guessing was intentional based on the plot) and then their relationship blossoms into a romance. When they both realise how much time they spend together, feelings of admiration develop and some totally gush worthy scenes result. The romance felt very natural and was expected. Their embarrassment and social awkwardness is simply adorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters of the cast are also very well rounded. Within the Chunibyo group that Rika establishes in the school. we have Rikka\u2019s closest Chunibyo friend Dekomori (below) who has an child-like excitement, Nibutani, a former Chunibyo that\u2019s trying to destroy the evidence that Dekomori has of her past identity. This results in some very amusing scenes between the two.\\n\\n\r\nWe have Kumin, the supporter of the group who tends to nap for the majority of the show. Makoto, Yuka\u2019s friend develops a ridiculous crush after she praises his newly bald head.\\n\\n\r\nThe teacher that both supports Rikka\u2019s fantasies, yet uses them to make sure that Rikka doesn\u2019t forget her responsibilities in the real world is also a loveable character.\\n\\n\r\nRikka\u2019s sister is one of the most interesting characters of all. She appears to be engaging with the fantasy world that Rikka keeps herself in by taking part in make believe battles in which Rikka wields an umbrella and she, a powerful soup ladle. She doesn\u2019t seem to have a totally negative outlook towards Rikka\u2019s negative personality, yet she does want Rikka to stop suppressing and accept her past. She is also a ninja and I love the fact that she treats Yuto like he is already a part of the family (by blackmailing him with his Chunibyo past).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of this anime is filled with vibrant colours and the battle scenes as seen from the Chunibyo\u2019s perspective are totally epic, such that you could imagine them belonging to a high fantasy anime.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this anime has a bigger meaning, in that it questions the validity of escapism and using fantasy worlds as a way to forget reality. Is it really so bad if we live in a world that is heavily influenced by the imaginative nature of our minds if that is what makes us happy? Do we ever really lose that child-like quality that we had, that wishes that normal situations were adventurous quests and that magic existed around every corner. I think the main message of this anime is that an imaginative mind can enrich our lives and bring excitement into the lives of others. Who cares what the naysayers have to say anyway? - they certainly won\u2019t be having as much fun.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for an adorable and well-crafted romance, imbedded with hilarious, random, cute moments, yet with an underlying layer of depth - look no further, this is the anime for you!!",

Somewhere from the middle we can see some drama with little pieces of comedy and romance.  And well, maybe it's wrong, but i see more drama side than any other.\r\n2)Characters-6.\r\nI got strange feeling, that i saw some characters somewhere, but they are have that strange essence, that we like or not in any characters - soul. But only soul isn't enough to make good characters that will remain in memory.\r\n3)Graphics/drawing/art-8.\r\nBefore we see anything other, we will meet graphical part. The drawing was pretty good. Colours wasbeautiful and looks eyecandy&smooth, and  there was no issues with drawing.\\n\\n\r\n4)Soundtrack-7.\\n\r\nNice background music and good soundtrack at key moments. But opening was kinda strange for me, sound was like... Pudding i guess?\\n\\n\r\n5)Plot-7.\\n\r\nNot so dynamic, but simple and relaxing good storyline. Drama elements also fits excellent, that makes watching comfortable and easy.\\n\\n\r\n6)Meaning.\\n\r\nMaybe not you all remember your childhood, but not only kids uses they're imagination to create they're own better world. In this anime you will see how much imagination can give to little human. That maybe seems awkward, but easy to understand. And there is also very good words at the end of title. I will not Write them, just try it out and listen to them. They was smooth and nice final note in the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nSome sides is good, some not enough. Nothing special, but nice.",

While most adults I know pine for an imaginary time in their youth when they were happy and/or cool (whenever they 'peaked', I guess), some of us look back on huge swathes of our history with very un-rose colored glasses. Shudder. Cringe at how earnest and unselfconscious we were. What I mean to say is were DEEPLY strange and existed in worlds unto ourselves. \r\nThis show celebrates that weirdness, and argues how it is necessary to shed past selves, even if this is process is sad. Italso suggests hope that one might maintain some of the 'magic' inside, even if our outward personas need be buttoned up, because, adulthood or whatever. \\n\\n\r\nMy only criticism is that the show maybe could have pushed the 'magic' further, made more 'battle' sequences, etc. Though maybe the glimpses are so moving and powerful and funny because they are far between.",

Aside from that I find the artwork is good, nothing to overly praise but nothing to complain about either and was satisfied with it, as with the sound and voices (Japanese).\r\n  The charactersis were the show really gets my credit, as I'm sure many can relate to their eccentric actions and ideas from the uncommon clothing that they wear to their manner of speech, myself included (wearing a housecoat as a cloak for example...)\\n\r\n  Overall I really liked this show, it moved along at a good pace and mixes in a nice combination of comedy, romance and story, not letting you get tired of anyone one thing. It makes you reminisce about your own past and how you yourself have grown as a person all while making you laugh along the way.",

What it DOES accomplish is to entertain you with silly cliches and recycled, but effective,  material... And it does so better than most anime I've watched lately.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nThis is the weakest point of the anime. It starts simple enough as a light comedy and satire. In the last four episodes it attempts to tag along a deeper story, which not only seems out of mood but is also handled haphazardly. It does however stir some nostalgia as other reviewers have mentioned. I myself grewout of my childhood fantasies at a very young age, and regret it. This story made me laugh at those silly yet happy memories.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThere is nothing really to admire or detest, seems typical Kyoani. Some deformity and scaling issues here and there but overall it is very good. Nice eye artwork on some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe one song with the guitar intro that plays throughout the series is VERY catchy and I found myself picking up my guitar and playing it a couple of times. The rest is typical but well done. No complaints at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nThere is nothing new or improved with the character archetypes. The exception is that the characters are playing with the notions and illusions (or delusions) of childhood fantasies, while attempting to grow out of them. The main leads are not fully developed or explained but remain enjoyable. The side characters are token-ish and poorly developed. BUT... They are funny, entertaining and just WORK with their surroundings and the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 11/10\\n\r\nYes I realize there is no 11. But, frankly, while the story and characters left much to be desired the overall enjoyment surprised me. I've watched the first eight episodes at least three times each. That is how much I enjoyed this anime. Some people gave this anime a low score, and I understand why. However, don't let those low scores fool you. The anime works. It's silly and reckless fun, don't expect anything more and you will enjoy it for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nChuunibyou could have easily played off as a typical mindless-moe, semi ecchi anime, but it didn't. No, it is not perfect, the anime has flaws. No, it doesn't bring anything new to the table. BUT, YES... It is entertaining. YES, it is funny. And yes... you will like it if you want to laugh at silly antics and the nostalgia associated with growing out of child-fantasy-filled mind.",

            "content": "Comedies often start off great, but then try to take a more serious note and subsequently fail miserably. Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is one of those shows that showed great promise, but in the attempt to get more serious lost most of its previous charm.\r\nOur story begins with Yuuta, who has suffered a great deal on behalf of his eight grade syndrome personality \u201cThe Dark Flame Master\u201d. He is starting anew in high-school trying to forget his embarrassing past, but on his first day Rikka, a girl in his class, who herself is still suffering from the syndrome, sees him descend back into hisprevious embarrassing self. She quickly starts making contact with him as he is capable of understanding her behaviour and she also lives one flat below her and soon they sort o become friends. She wants to organise a school club to her delusions and gets Yuuta to join. They also manage to get a few more people into the club and they start having different fun adventures together.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is nothing to original the comedy is just so well done as are the character interactions that it is easy to forgive all the shortcomings. Things start to go seriously downhill at the halfway point as the show wants to complicate things and change more into a drama. While in theory there is nothing wrong with that, here it just manages to make everything unbelievably boring, so much so that I was seriously thinking of dropping the show around episode nine, but luckily I hadn't as the story managed to improve substantially in the last few episodes, but fails to match the greatness of the first half. The ending itself is pretty great and gives us a nice starting point for the next season, which I am still not sure as to watch it or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all a lot of fun and Yuuta and especially Rikka have nicely developed backstories. The character dynamics are fabulous as well as they each compliment each other perfectly and the whole group of characters surrounding our leads is a whole lot of fun and has this great diversity. Still there are a few problems as many characters are not in the least original and the backstories of the other main characters are left unexplored.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nice if not particularly original. I especially liked Rikka but her similarity with Misaki Mei from Another is just too uncanny. The thing I have to point out are the imaginary battle sequences as they are beautifully animated and the way the view sometimes changes to the one of the spectators is just brilliant. The opening is great and it includes the cutest sequence I have seen since the scene of Bell and Hestia brushing their teeth in the ending of Dan Machi. The soundtrack is nothing to write home about, but it is serviceable.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is a greatly flawed anime, but even so the first part is just so good that I am unable to give it a lower score than a 7. I have to say that the first part would have warranted a 10, but the following episodes ruined the good first impression. This is not an anime I am able to wholeheartedly recommend to anyone as it is the closest I have ever been to dropping an anime, but the beginning is exceptional and it might be worth watching it only for the first few episodes.\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment or read some of my other reviews.",

            "content": "Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai is a show that reminds me of why I first fell in love with anime. It manages to tell a touching story that is familiar in my heart, yet not familiar to my eyes and memory. It has characters that have character, music that evokes emotion, and manages- as a show- to leave me with a profound state of mind as it all comes to a close. \r\nStory: The story of Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai is an interesting one, with sadness, happiness and a clear message to give to the viewer. Chuunibyou manages to weave a beautiful story arounda club of students struggling with their transition to adulthood. The story's high points are when it tries to emphasize this message and express the beauty in childlike imagination to the audience, yet it's weak link is less what it did wrong, and more what it didn't do: the story did not move for the other characters; a good contrast to this problem would be the show Sakurasou no pet na kanojo, which manages to have all the characters' stories have a start and a conclusion. This show ultimately just lacked a good resolution for everything outside of it's starstruck couple. \\n\r\nArt: The art matches the story well. The characters are animated to look very innocent and gentle. It is not animated \"realistically\" but in this scenario, it works perfectly, complimenting the story's soft and meaningful message about why playful imagination is a redeeming and beautiful quality. \\n\r\nSound: This show's greatest achievement in \"sound\" is it's music, which manages to add another level of emotion to it's scenes. The music swells, grows or softens in all the perfect places, woven perfectly together with the animation and voice acting. \\n\r\nCharacter: This area received the lowest score from me due to how badly fleshed out the relationships between the characters were, especially in regards to the main supporting male protagonist, Makoto Isshiki. Whereas shows like Toradora, Sakurasou, and Steins;Gate set aside entire episodes to expand the stories of the supporting cast, Chuunibyou could not even afford a few minutes for them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved the show, it made me very happy, but it lacked the polish that I appreciated in the true masterpiece animes I've viewed in the past, such as Shigatsu wa kimi no uso, or Steins;Gate. So this show will get a 9 from me, even though it is realistically more a high 8.8 ish rating. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

The plot is original and the flow of the story is interesting. Both the drama and comedy elements are not far-fetched at all. The drama is authentic and very relatable. There\u2019s also nice timing with the comedy parts. \r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\r\nAs it is a story about weirdness and all; it is given that there are over so interesting and funny characters withdifferent antics. And not to mention they are so adorable and cute. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION\\n\r\nAs expected from the animators of Clannad, K-On, Hyouka, etc; Kyoto Animation did an incredible job with this one as well. The character designs are so adorable and cute. Even the delusional fighting scenes are awesome which can be compared to some GENUINE action series.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI laughed, I cried, and I was inspired. It\u2019s not only fun and enjoyable but the lessons that the series is trying to convey is really inspiring. This series might as well explained why anime, hero, game, cartoons, movie enthusiasts embarked in their own fictional world. For realistic people it might be beyond their comprehension but everyone has the right to choose their delusions and reality. Being realistic doesn\u2019t necessarily make you stronger. Everyone has their own way of coping with lost and too much pain.\\n",

(shortened to Chuunibyou for this review) has stayed in my mind long after I first watched it. It is undoubtably a good anime for many reasons, but I think the one reason that this story has a strong pull on my heart strings, lies in how it is a nifty little tale that is suited for 'otaku' sensibilities. By that I do not mean that Chuunibyou is a fan-service ridden anime, instead, I think the essence of the story whispers closely to the soul of the otaku.\r\nPlot Premise\r\nThe storyis a rather simple one that is reminiscent of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and other stories from the slice of life genre. It begins with introducing Yuuta Togashi, a boy who is just beginning high school life. Yuuta is shown to have put aside his Chuunibyou, a popular term for young teens who are apparently afflicted with a delusion of reality and start believing in their own constructed version of it (e.g the people who claim that they are true 'witches' from school) Yuuta dubbed himself as the 'Dark Flame Master' and claimed that he pretends that he possesses supernatural powers for most of his junior high school life. However, he wants to put that aside and start afresh in high school.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Rikka Takanashi, Yuuta's neighbor from the apartment above his. Rikka wears an eye patch over her right eye and claims to possess the power of the 'Wicked eye'/'Tyrant's eye', and goes to the same high school as Yuuta. Just as Yuuta is about to put his Dark Flame Master persona away for good, Rikka prevents him from doing so through a series of hilarious events. Eventually, they begin a Circle in school, together with other new found friends.\\n\\n\r\nThe Awesome Bits\\n\\n\r\nTo talk about the awesome bits, I must begin with the sheer visuals of it. Kyoto Animation have once again created helplessly adorable characters that is overflowing with Moe. Although the story is really set in the slice of life genre, the delusions of Rikka and her 'servant,' Sanae Dekomori, often end up in beautifully drawn battle sequences from the Madoka girl, Mecha and Samurai fighting genre. There is also the Kyoto Animation staples such as the adorable Yumeha Togashi (Yuuta's 5 year old sister), the Kuudere Toka Takanashi (Rikka's sister) and Kumin Tsuyuri, whose role in the anime is to provide an adorable lazy neko character in the background. (She joined Rikka's circle by merging her own 'nap time circle' with it. The aim of the circle, well, is to explore the happiness of napping.)\\n\\n\r\nThe Otaku Fantasy\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou speaks on the 'Otaku' subculture and the tensions that such a subculture has with mainstream society through the concept of Chuunibyou. Otaku subculture is seen by many as a symptom of the 'Peter Pan Syndrome' whereby young adults and adults refuse to 'grow up' and take 'adult responsibilities.' In the Anime, this resonates strongly with Yuuta's rejection of his Dark Flame Master persona together with all the paraphernalia  surrounding that fantasy world. Moreover, the use of Germanic/Rune words of Rikka and Yuuta's fantasy world further reflect how the Otaku subculture have included Japanese words such as Tsundere and Moe into our lexicon. An interesting example here would be Sanae Dekomori, who uses the word \"death\" as a replacement for the Japanese particle \"Desu\". In fact, every character plays some kind of reference to the Otaku world. My abbreviated interpretation of it would be as follows:\\n\\n\r\n1. Yuuta Togashi: The Otaku who is trying to integrate into mainstream society by hiding his Otaku-ness\\n\r\n2. Rikka Takanashi: The Otaku who isn't afraid to be herself at all times, resulting in her becoming socially inept.\\n\r\n3. Shinka Nibutani/ Mori Summer: The Otaku 'idol' who have written and made fan fiction and other works that have influenced the Otaku world.\\n\r\n4. Kumin Tsuyuri: The Cat Lover Otaku\\n\r\n5. Sanae Dekomori: The Genius Otaku\\n\r\n6. Makoto Isshiki: The Ecchi Otaku\\n\r\n7. Yumeha Togashi: The young manga/anime lover who is potentially going to be an Otaku\\n\r\n8. Toka Takanashi: The Otaku hater\\n\\n\r\nIn this sense, the term Chuunibyou  itself can be seen as a variant of the Peter Pan Syndrome.\\n\\n\r\nIn Nozomi Osaka's exploration of this Otaku theme, she presents us with complex questions that mirror the concerns of the Otaku. For instance, the Chuunibyou roleplaying may be very entertaining and fun for all the members of the circle, however, will there come a time when there is a need to be 'serious' and cast away the role play? This is especially for characters like Rikka and Sanae who adopt a 'permanent role play' to all aspects of their daily lives. Through Rikka, we are also asked if Chuunibyou and by extension Otakus are in fact avoiding some aspect of their lives through this role play. Finally, Nozomi asks us, even if we truly are making up a world of our own, is there anything really wrong with it? Isn't everything around us such as a 'happy family' or a 'normal life' also constructed fantasy?\\n\\n\r\nI give Nozomi credit for exploring such a serious theme under the guise of the slice of life genre. I especially enjoy how much of these questions are left to the viewer's discretion and interpretation.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou is a sweet story that will leave a warm feeling inside your Otaku heart. However it has a small flaw, which is that it is a little short and the exploration of the Otaku theme could have been explored in more depth. Nevertheless, it is one of the best animes I have watched recently and I highly recommend it.\\n",

It's not great but it's entertaining that I get a laugh every episode. Still nothing on monogatari/gintama but it's consistent enough.\r\nStory- Here's the only part I have a problem with. The charactersthemselves need a push. The romance is too \"shy\" after they go out, which is weird because it was pretty straightforward before then.(filling the time?) I like the running gags but sometimes its like..did we really need an episode where absolutely nothing happened?\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo give it some arbitrary score I say: 8/10, good anime.\\n\r\n---------------------------------\\n\r\nMinor praise and complaints.\\n\\n\r\nPraise:\\n\r\n-I like how the running gag is imagination land. It's used very creatively and it is a good gag.\\n\r\n-I think the characters themselves are pretty well done, even the girl who naps all the time, Kumin(my favorite char btw), has enough of a presence that she doesn't feel like \"generic X archetype\". This is primarily Kyo-ani's fault, but all the same.\\n\r\n-The general combat scenes are both good and bad. Good in that I'd rather see an alternative anime with this JRPG setting, bad that they are sometimes very bland while other times pretty good(and funny thereafter).\\n\r\n-Original idea on the HS romance. Chuunibyo(or 8th grade syndrome in some subs), is a pretty unique.\\n\\n\\n\r\nComplaints\\n\r\n- A little too many moe-shots sometimes. Its Kyo-ani and they do this with everything, but still.\\n\r\n- Re-occuring episodes/themes. Some of Rikka's rival points or mori-summer's arcs are rather similar to an episode or two before. However this doesn't happen all that often(once or twice).\\n\r\n- Kind of odd scenarios where the adults keep telling rikka \"don't believe in this fantasy\" but then participate in it fully. Contradicting message.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------",

            "content": "First off, this show is pretty great, it has excellent characters and a intriguing (if slightly obvious) plot and manages to keep you engaged throughout every moment of every episode.\r\nStory - 8 - Good pacing, even if the overarching plot is pretty obvious.\r\nThe story is based around a general idea of finding yourself, and both coming to terms with reality whilst not blindly following the folds of the majority, and instead being your own person. This story I feel is well told and I personally enjoyed it a bunch, I think everyone would enjoy this story at least a little bit.\r\nSound and Art - 7- Some specifically fantastic moments of both art and sound, but overall just above average but nothing truly unique or unnervingly excellent.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for this anime is pretty good throughout its entirety, there are some places where i though it worked perfectly but most of the time I didn't particularly notice it either way. That is to say its absolutely fine, absolutely nothing wrong with it. The art is again, pretty good, with some fantastic looking scenes (you'll  see when you watch it), but most of the time its is just a modern looking well drawn and animated show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8 - A good cast, with unique personalities, though nothing particularly special.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I say nothing particularly special I mean none of the characters are truly unique, but they are all written and voiced incredibly well, they also mix together believably and exceptionally well. The best of the cast is the main character (of course) but all of the other characters including the deuteragonist are all still great characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8 - An excellent series well deserving of a watch by pretty much anyone and everyone.\\n\\n\r\nAs I have said, there are many draws for this anime and barely any turn-aways, so I think everyone would enjoy it. The characters, plot, sound and art all work perfectly with each other. The only reason I didn't give it a 9 or 10 is because there is nothing truly unique about it. But even in my harsh judgings it is well worth an 8, meaning that I believe this anime is very good. Be sure to watch it.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The Ethereal Horizon is real.\r\nAUTHOR'S NOTE:\r\nIt's very difficult to write a review about \"slice of life\" animes. In fact, I hate writing about it because they are quite repetitive and difficult to analyze (what is there to analyze about the drama and romance factor?). Usually, romance and drama are built into \"slice of life\" animes, so I will try my best to write a clear review about why I've given Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! (Chu-2) such a high score.\r\nSTORY (7/10):\r\nChu-2 is a typical \"slice of life\" anime. There is nothing too exciting about it. But the normal school life is only a clever disguiseto reach a subject that is much greater than just living out your adolescence to the fullest. The storyline is straightforward, yet sly in introducing this subject. At first, we are not aware of it because we get too indulged in the comedy. Not too say the comedy is bland, but phenomenal. And the \"romance\" bit does not even kick in until the midst of the anime. But when the reality hammer strikes, I promise the viewers will notice it immediately.\\n\\n\r\nI have learned something very important after watching Chu-2. Yes, the drama, romance, and the comedy is all there. They are top-notch. However, after watching the anime, I've come to a realization that Chu-2 allows the viewers to face their reality and may even affect us mentally (ironically). Chu-2 succeeds in giving us the over-exaggerated emotions through its drama, but that's what makes Chu-2 shine, as that is its purpose. We are told that Chuunibyou is a \"syndrome\" but as the story progresses, the viewers become challenged to a point of reflecting back into their own lives. That's the beauty of Chu-2's storyline: We all face tragedies and want to protect ourselves from the reality of it. And when we begin to accept such tragedies as reality, we become cold-hearted and pessimistic. The magic that we once found in small things disappears because we try too hard to accept reality. When a magnitude of such power and inspirational content is put into an anime, when such reality is able to rise out of an fictional tale, in such a short span (12 episodes), it's quite amazing what anime can do.\\n\\n\r\nART (8/10):\\n\r\nThe fluidity of the animation does not disappoint. I love all of the action scenes in Chu-2, and it only becomes hilarious, as they are indefinitely a figment of the characters' imaginations. I just thought it was so clever how exaggerated the actions scenes are, then when we are back to \"reality\", the animation becomes dense. The production team cleverly switches from the \"real world\" and the \"delusional world\" quite rapidly sometimes, which is top-notch animation, if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nWe do see some laziness in the drawings and graphics. The viewers are not always rewarded with mind-blowing and breath-taking graphics or background, but we do see them only when necessary.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8/10):\\n\r\nSince it's such a short anime, we only have an OP and EP, in addition to the emotional soundtracks within the anime. \"Sparkling Daydream\" by Zaq was not my cup of tea, as it was overly energetic and it did not support the mood when the anime began its \"darker\" turn. I feel that they should have inserted a secondary OP, for the change of pace in a 12-episode anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending theme is \"Inside Identity\" by Black Raison d'\u00eatre, which is the better half of the soundtracks. The heart-pumping speed of the music and lyrics synchronizes with the drama and romance in Chu-2, which is a big plus. It fits perfectly with the anime and if you do end up watching it, the band gets an awesome canon feature (a cookie for you, if you catch it).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (8/10):\\n\r\nRikka Takanashi is the soul of Chu-2. If she did not appear in the anime with her peculiar, but extremely cute personality, it would have changed the whole anime entirely. In fact, her presence may be the reason why she took more than half of the points given in this category. The production team has ingeniously brought Rikka to life from the lite novel itself. At first glance, Rikka is a hopeless delusional high-schooler but as any great anime should have, the heroine carries demons from the past that is eventually exposed in a creative twist. Viewers will end up cheering for Rikka whether she is confronting constant dilemmas, battling reality vs delusions, and the conflicting character change she endures as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nMakoto Isshiki, aka, \"Dark Flame Master\" is the ultimate straight-man in Chu-2. His personality is so straight-edged, it even begins to change those close to him, and may even annoy the viewers (me). An understandable character, as we find what made this ex-Chuunibyou such an asshole in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, excellent animes cannot focus on the hero/heroine so much that they shove friends and allies to the background. At first, we are introduced to several characters that sparks a lot of interest, but when it's time for the hero/heroine to shine, the supporting characters are thrown into the shade. This happens several times in Chu-2 which is a disappointment because I wanted to dive deeper intoe Shinka Nibutani and Sanae Dekomori's character. It seems the length of a short anime, no matter how good the characters, can be a downfall, after all.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (8/10):\\n\r\nA very interesting anime that has made me think critically and for such a short anime to do so, I'm very impressed by Chu-2. I've greatly enjoyed the embarrassment comedy factors in the anime, which is quite difficult to get through me. The concept of the storyline and twists were original and the romantic moments were very heart-warming. My only wish is that it could have had additional episodes that focused more on the supporting characters, as their roles were extremely important in building the hero/heroine and revitalizing the inner conflicts between Rikka and Makoto. Thus said, I openly recommend anyone to dive into this Ethereal Horizon and become seduced by Rikka's Tyrant's Eye.\\n",

As Yuuta and Rikka's lives become more and more joined, they start to become closer. Can't get better than that~\r\nCharacters: 8/10\r\n    The characters are awesome. I don't really know what else I can say about them..\r\n    I didn't like sleep-girl or cheerleading-girl that much though. For me, it was ALL Rikka, Dekomori, and Yuuta~\r\n    Justthey're pasts, stories, and imagination are something I've never seen in an anime before~\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n    The sound quality when it came to battles, playing and lousing around was great. The voice actors/actresses were brilliant and portrayed the characters very well. The opening + ending song video and music were also good, but nothing amazing/memorable for my tastes apart from the awesome .gifs they provided \\n\\n\r\n    [video=youtube;4ocZMgqtVkc]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ocZMgqtVkc[/video]\\n\\n\r\n    [video=youtube;PwDAl_3Bwpg]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwDAl_3Bwpg[/video]\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n    When it comes to seeing through Rikka and Dekomori's (her \"servant\") eyes, the story becomes very magical. Since they see everything different, it is a whole new adventure for people to see. Pretend battles, alternate playing fields are all part of Rikka's eighth grader syndrome. Not to mention that everything outside of their imagination is also brilliant. The lighting and colouring hit the spot well and gave off a surperb feeling. Here are some screenshots:\\n\r\n    [SPOILER][/SPOILER]\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n    I was going to give Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! a 9/10, but couldn't when I saw the ending...\\n\r\n    Everything seemed in place and well co-ordinated, and to be honest I don't know how they pulled it off. Watching the characters develop and adjust to situations was great and an experience I can live over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL RATE: 48/50\\n\\n\r\n    To clarify in case one didn't realize this already, I'm rating this anime so high because I personally thoroughly enjoyed it. You might be able to tell by now that I'm not in any way a serious critic and simply rate the anime I like, what I rate them - for me. This is in no shape or form the best anime ever, but it's one of my favourites thus this score. I love anime that are unique and give me a new experience that I've never seen before, and this anime is one of them~\\n\\n\r\n    Was really surprised that a second season was announced, but I'm not complaining! Can't wait for that to air next season hopefully~ Obviously recommending EVERYONE to watch this anime, I'd definitely say that people of all ages will enjoy it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nReccomendations:\\n\\n\r\n    There's nothing else like this anime. It's one of those definite must-watch masterpieces.",

If you were a \"special\" child growing up which I definitely was with my imaginary friends and alter egos then the first 3-4 episodes are some of the funniest anime episodes you'll see. I was on the ground laughing and thought this anime was the bees knees until around episode 5. That is when everything changed, the incredibly funny anime turned into a quite unique and very dramatic story. After the first season I was almost in tears,all the comedy was completely overshadowed by the depressing story. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime and its follow up season \"chuunibyou demo koi ga shitai ren\" should be watched because it is very unique, has a lot of very funny moments, very sad moments, very kawaii romance and the like.\\n\\n\r\nMy only disappointment with this anime is that I wished it stayed light hearted and funny like the first few episodes but instead I had to turn in my man card and pretty much cried by the end of the first season. The second season is much more light hearted though. Overall this is a great anime series and would recommend to anyone.",

One day when I was at my boyfriend's house he said that we should watch this anime. We watched it and we both became real fans of it.\r\n~STORY~\r\nThe story is nice and very cute, I enjoyed it a lot. There was a lot of comedy elements that just made me laugh all the time. The romance is very cute, I would fangirl all the time XD. I would relate a lot to some of the characters. \r\n~ART/ANIMATION~\r\nThe artis very cute and moe. I love it a lot. It is very colorful and well animated. One of my favorite things about the animation was the battle scenes, the battle scenes were just amazing and beautiful. Especially the type of world Rikka would imagine. The character designs are very cute and adorable :3\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~\\n\r\nI love the sound track, I listen to it all the time. I really like the opening and ending song. The background music blends in with the scene, it doesn't distract me from the anime. Some of the sound trakt is very happy while other is really sad, which I like.\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTERS~\\n\r\nI think the characters are the biggest highlights of this anime. All of the characters are really likable and they all have their unique charm. Rikka is one of my favorite characters of all time. One of the characters that I related to a lot was Nibutani; I use to be someone else on the Internet that I want to forget now, when my friends bring up the topic of who I was in the Internet I would just cringe and beg them to stop. \\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~\\n\r\nI really enjoyed everything about this anime. I can see why people like it a lot. Sometimes I think to myself \"Why haven't I watched this before?\" I would rewatch this again and again because that's how much I enjoyed it. If you like moe characters, fanasy, romance, and comedy type of anime then you should really go and watch this one.",

It featured a girl with spinning fingers and an eye patch. It was not the first time I\u2019d seen it either so I decided to satiate my curiosity once and for all and find out who she was and, more importantly, where she came from. Doing a simple Google image search I soon found out her name was Rikka Takanashi and that she was one of the leads in an anime called, \u201cChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!\u201d which apparently translates to, \u201cLove, Chunibyo& Other Delusions.\u201d  It seemed like a light-hearted show so I decided to give it a try (because god knows I don\u2019t have enough anime to watch).\\n\\n\r\nThe story features a 16-year-old boy named Yuuta Togashi who has just finished middle school and is about to enter high school. Before that, however, he has promised himself to leave his dark past behind, particularly his \u201cchuunibyou.\u201d I should perhaps explain that \u201cchuunibyou\u201d is a Japanese term commonly used in anime that roughly translates to \u201cmiddle school 2nd year syndrome\u201d and it involves youngsters, between the ages of 10 and 14, pretending to be something they aren\u2019t or boasting they have special powers in an attempt to be different from the rest. It is simply one of the many stages involved in growing up and finding our place in this world and we may often look back on it with a mixture of emotions that include fondness, embarrassment, and regret.\\n\\n\r\nYuuta\u2019s chosen persona during those years was that of the \u201cDark Flame Master\u201d and it reached a point that his perception of reality was shaped by this persona and its imaginary battles and quests. Now that he\u2019s entering high school, however, he has decided to \u201cgrow up\u201d and put all that behind him, going as far as choosing a high school several miles away from his home. So, naturally, it comes as a shock when he meets Rikka Takanashi, a girl also in his year who has a full-blown case of chuunibyou and is fully aware of his alternate persona. To make matters worse, Rikka is determined to enlist the Dark Flame Master\u2019s help in her quest for the Ethereal Horizon no matter the cost.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the setup for our story. The anime begins as a light-hearted comedy with Yuuta trying his best to distance himself from Rikka and in so doing becoming more and more attached. We\u2019re also introduced to other secondary characters that will eventually become part of Yuuta\u2019s and Rikka\u2019s circle, such as Dekomori, Rikka\u2019s servant/apprentice; Nabutani, another girl in their term with secrets of her own; Kumin, a senior overly fond of napping; and Isshiki, a male student who acts as comic relief from time to time. Although there isn\u2019t much to talk about in terms of character development for the secondary characters, some of which are fairly one-dimensional, they do have their moments and it is fun to watch how they interact with each other in typical, and not-so-typical, high school fashion.\\n\\n\r\nBecause both Rikka and Dekomori continue to live out their chuunibyou fantasies, the show elevates mundane affairs into fully-fledged magical duels with fantastically oversized weapons, a vast array of spells, and a soundtrack to boot. Even the characters who do not share in their fantasies are depicted as powerful enemies with powers of their own. One such enemy is Touka Takanashi, Rikka\u2019s older sister, who has gained the title of \u201cPriestess\u201d in Rikka\u2019s fantasy and is deadly accurate with a soup spoon. Touka does not approve of nor understand Rikka\u2019s attitude and can therefore come across as harsh in her dealings with Rikka and her friends. It is why she reaches out (initially through blackmail) to Yuuta, the one person she believes can communicate effectively with her younger sister, and little by little we are treated to this anime\u2019s unexpectedly sadder side as we begin to unveil the reason behind Rikka\u2019s chuunibyou.\\n\\n\r\nIn the midst of this we have Rikka\u2019s and Yuuta\u2019s budding romance which is refreshingly subtle if a tad unconvincing at first. The reason why I had some trouble buying into their romance is because their relationship is more akin to a brother-sister relationship with Yuuta often acting the part of the older brother punishing Rikka whenever she gets too carried away, much in the same way other anime feature an older sister or a girlfriend carrying out this role. Indeed, Rikka\u2019s appearance and attitude belies her age (16, same as Yuuta) so that threw me off as well but that is, after all, the point of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs is to be expected, both Rikka and Yuuta develop the most as characters and as Yuuta grows to care more and more about her reality eventually clashes with fantasy. Perhaps what I find most unjust about the show is precisely the amount of responsibility that Rikka\u2019s family place on Yuuta\u2019s shoulders what ultimately leads to one of the show\u2019s saddest moments as Rikka is forced to abandon her fantasies. Nonetheless, it also serves as the catalyzer for Yuuta to find out more about who he is and what he wants and thus fight ever harder for the girl he loves, leading into the very emotive season finale (which is somewhat spoiled by the voiceover monologue).\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, while the show is not without its faults and is probably not water-tight story-wise, it never once detracted me from looking forward to and enjoying the next episode right up until the end. It\u2019s a high-school comedy with a good balance between romance and drama and one of the most endearing romances I have seen in an anime to date as Rikka and Yuuta enter a new and uncertain stage in their lives.",

            "content": "Came in expecting a show just for some simple laughs to kill my free time. \r\nWent out with a moral lesson and an emotional ride. \r\nChuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is one of those shows that I began watching without a clue on what it truly is. I was expecting a comedy show revolving around the main character, Rikka and her chuuni antics. Since the name of the show has the word \u201cKoi\u201d (Love) in it, so when I saw Yuuta being the male lead of the show, immediately I ship them together, since episode one. \r\nI wasn\u2019t that far off, at least for thefirst half of the show, where comedy is its main driving force, and its aim is to introduce us to the other main characters, bringing us to light about their school life. It is all and well, until the second half kicks in. \\n\\n\r\nDamn, I was totally caught in surprise there. \\n\\n\r\nWe are then enlightened by the hard truths about Rikka\u2019s chuuni, I was laughing for six episodes then suddenly I found myself teary-eyed for the remaining six. Rikka suddenly became a character that we all sympathize with, her dark past gradually unfold as we are shown the reason why the relationship between Rikka and the rest of her family members is so poor since episode two. Without spoiling much, the second half is all about Rikka facing herself and her own dark past, with the help of Yuuta, of course.\\n\\n\r\nDrama swiftly follows, and the show ends with a strong resolution, albeit it is quite an ass-pull, the narrator wraps up the show in a pretty sweet manner explaining the details of the chuunibyou syndrome. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the presentation itself, KyoAni, I believe, would be the best studio to adapt such a story. Often times the comedy presented is pretty simple, yet with its vivid delivery it often led to a very satisfying experience. Is this KyoAni\u2019s first attempt in producing action scenes? I am not too sure myself, but I must say they did a really good job on it. Seeing Rikka and Sanae wielding weapons larger than Gut\u2019s Dragon Slayer really laughed my ass off on several occasions. \\n\\n\r\nFor the sounds themselves, the seiyuus pretty much brought out the personalities and emotions of each character well, not much to complain here. An honorable mention to the OP song, Sparkling Daydream, which started off wishy-washy then escalated to an emotional and strong chorus, truly fitting of the overall pacing of the show. The ED? I am not particularly fond of it, so I will pass on that. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters? Ultimately this is Rikka\u2019s and Yuuta\u2019s show, and the others are pretty much side characters. They do blend in well with the duo and provide good support beneficial to the show. \\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict? This show barely edges out to the score of 8 for me. It has decent moments of quality here and there, but the final ass-pull ending is indeed a letdown. Still, for those who is looking for a show of nice comedy but with some plot to boot as well, give Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! a try. \\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nFinally a show that made me feel relatable to the characters because the way these characters act is exactly how I act.\r\nThe story centres around Yuuta Togashi who used to be a Chunnibyou called The Dark Flame Master, but now that he is starting High School he wants to rebegin his life until the Chunnibyou Rikka Takanashi the sacred vessel of The Wicked Eye changes all of that.\r\nNow I really enjoyed the story mainly because it gives us an insight that not everyone growing up will grow out of their childish fantasies or will create something new out of it and this iswhat this anime does brilliantly.\\n\r\nI loved the way Rikka and her other Chunnibyou friends talked as if they were speaking in riddles making most people not understand them, plus the way Rikka acts around other people with her Chunnibyou personality was really funny and always caused a lot of problems for Yuuta and the others making for some hilarious scenes, but that doesn't mean this anime is all fun and games you do eventually find out that Rikka uses her Chunnibyou personality as a coping mechanism because of the death of her parents and it makes you feel closer to Rikka as a person including myself because there are many people like her who use this exact thing to cope with loose, guilt or even regret so the story had great comedy and well rounded characters, but it also had a very relatable issue too which a lot of us can understand.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters were so funny and amazing despite being one of the most dysfunctional groups ever it works so well somehow. \\n\r\nRikka is the female MC and is an incredibly likeable character ranging from her mischievous activities as a Chunnibyou that always make life difficult for the others to her adorable nature when she encounters something she doesn't understand or her interactions with Yuuta.\\n\r\nYuuta is the male MC and is a former Chunnibyou so finding another person who is trying to make him go back into it is not going to make him happy, but his reasons can be understandable however it doesn't mean he hates Rikka instead it's quite the opposite despite not wanting to be a Chunnibyou again he still cares about Rikka's own being and is willing to help her with none Chunnibyou stuff like school work.\\n\r\nSanae Dekomori is Rikka's best friend and a fellow Chunnibyou going by as Rikka's servant, but that doesn't mean she's dumb or clumsy in fact she is actually very smart and has a very hyper personality which makes her a very fun and likeable character, but it does get on the nerves of someone else.\\n\r\nShinka Nibutani is another former Chunnibyou who went by the name of Mori Summer and obviously when Dekomori finds out her secret she gets really embarrassed and annoyed which makes Dekomori believe her to be a fake Mori Summer, Shinka has a short temper and really causes more harm than good for the others, but she still goes along with their Chunnibyou antics.\\n\r\nKumin Tsuyuri is the oldest of the group and is a very quiet girl not that she doesn't speak she just loves to sleep and agrees with Rikka to combine their clubs together, despite being sleepy most of the time Kumin is actually a very sweet, adorable and a little ditsy sometimes making her a very fun character.\\n\r\nThere are also some memorable character like Yuuta's friend Makoto Isshiki who is a bit of a womaniser and has his heart set on Kumin, but he isn't a bad guy and is willing to help out with Rikka's club from time to time, then there is also Rikka's older sister Tooka who is entirely against the whole Chunnibyou thing and desperately wants Yuuta to help her overcome it because she is using it to hide her sadness, but you don't want to anger her otherwise she'll use her cutlery against you.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle was actually very colourful and made the characters stand out against others I've seen in the past, the pretend battles that also took place looked amazing and had a lot of detail put into them despite how short the battles were, but even though they were short they still looked pretty damn cool to look at. I loved the intro and outro too, they were both very catchy which always made them fun to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was really well done despite the characters arguing most of the time they had great chemistry and seemed like people I would want to be friends with, the best parts are pretty much between Yuuta and Rikka along with the massive arguments between Dekomori and Nibutani.\\n\r\nThe development between these characters was very well done though despite Yuuta not wanting to go back to his Chunnibyou state he still hanged around and helped Rikka with the real life issues which eventually made him understand why she is a Chunnibyou and the way these two were together was just absolutely brilliantly which can also be said for the development between Dekomori and Nibutani who have so many arguments it was actually really funny to watch since they have a continuous rivalry throughout the show and seeing their spouts was just comedic gold.\\n\\n\r\nThe Chunnibyou aspect was done amazingly well and being a fellow Chunnibyou myself I am glad I got to see something like this made because Rikka along with her other friends certainly deserve to be praised.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a fun and sweet anime, if you do enjoy comedy and want some interesting and unique characters then this won't disappoint you.",

            "content": "\"I am dark flame master!\"\r\nEveryone has had their moments where they roleplayed something, only to find it silly and embarrassing later on. So, what is Chuunibyou about? Exactly that! Onto my review!\r\nStory: The story in Chuunibyou is pretty simple, a dude grows out of a phase, only to find that his neighbor is what he used to be: a Chuunibyou. After that, he learns that his neighbor, Rikka goes to his school, and all sorts of antics happen after. He joins a club, people actually join it later, and he eventually falls in love with Rikka. Basically, the story is a normal SoL plotline wherea character must undergo a change.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Normally, Slice of Life anime like this wouldn't have art that stands out. However, the art in this anime certainly does. In this anime, they put extra detail into the \"fight scenes\", turning a boring battle with awkward hand motions into a fight with magic, explosions, weapons, you name it. Also, Rikka is just way too kawaii for us.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I like music, which is really evident in my Love Live review. So, it's only natural that I would enjoy the opening and endings a lot. But the real winner of the sound category is the voice acting. Yuuta's voice actor does an amazing job contrasting him with his Chuunibyou side, Dark Flame Master. Rikka's voice actress also does a nice job, especially with the waifu abuse scenes. I just can't get enough of how kawaii Rikka is. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters in this story are simple, but effective. As said above, Yuuta used to be a Chuunibyou, but then wanted to be a normal person after everyone avoided him since he wasn't normal. Throughout the anime, he turns from \"really against Chuunibyou\" to \"supporting it, but not being one\". His development wasn't in his personality, but mainly his opinions. However, Rikka goes through a really big change. She starts as a Chuunibyou, but then later on, she makes a change that Yuuta tried to push onto her throughout the anime. But after realising that he screwed up, he tries to undo Rikka's change and have her become a Chuunibyou again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Chuunibyou is a very enjoyable anime, and I'd recommend it to lots of people. Although the story is like a normal SoL anime, with changes in the plot mainly being changes in the character, I think that some people who don't watch SoL would enjoy it. Anyways, that's my review. Bye!",

            "content": "So,challenged by a friend I decidied to start writing some reviews.I write a lot on my free time and anime is just such a big part of me that it only maked sense to join these two passions.\r\nFor my first review? \"Chuunybio demo Koi ga Shitai!\" or as we know it,Chuunibyou\r\nLet's do this,shall we?\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story follows our main hero Yuuta and his adventure at his new High School.As you'd expect,he get's to know a lot of people and get's joined by some of these acquaintances (we'll get to that),but we can say that the main characther he meets is this girl named Rikka,which liveson the floor above him.From here, the story resolves about Rikka facing her family and ,let's say...phycological struggles.We also get to see the friendship between Yuuta and the other characters blossom,but we get to see a lot more of Rikka since she's kind of the main characther,because Yuuta follows her around to get her plenty of screentime.And,come to think about it,that's it.There's not much to the story other than that.Don't get me wrong,this show is written perfectly,but I don't think the story is the selling point for this anime,since if you want to say what this show is about on a spolier-free version,you'll probably say, just like I did, that it is about this girl who's dealing with some issues in a very entertaining way.And if you can shrink an entire plot to that statement,than that plot isn't the selling point for that anime.Again: This show is very entertaining to watch nonetheless,and you'll hardly get tired of it's story.The pace is on point and the the jokes range from cringy to very funny.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this anime is very,very good.Astonishing really.The art style feels fresh and it follows the story perfectly.The darker tones on the sad sequences,the lighter tones on comedy scenes make you feel inside the plot and really give you a sense of what's happening with these characthers.It blends in perfectly with the idea behind the anime and it was produced flawlessly.Bravo.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for this anime is also very good.I'm a sucker for openings and endings when it comes to anime and I got to say that Chuunybio did a very good jog on those departments.As for the soundtrack,very good job as well.The music blends in with the conversations and the story telling and, just like the art, makes you feel what the characthers are probably feelling, making the experience of watching this anime a very inclusive one.On the other hand, there isn't an OST that you'd want to download to your phone,there isn't a song that really stands out.If you go on and listen to the whole soundtrack,you'll find that it is very enjoyable (and trust me,it is more enjoyable when you listen to it on context) but none of it's songs really stands out.Still,good job on this point too\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nNow THIS is the seller of Chuunibyo.The story itself,the plot written around the characthers would be nothing,and I mean NOTHING, if it weren't for the characthers.I can't really say much on an attempt to keep this review spoiler-free,but the characters really are what makes Chuunybio great. Rikka,for instance, can range from a very adorkable and fun character to a very deep and interesting one.And that's just an example. All the back stories,all the different ways they deal with the everyday life,all the gags and confrontations really make these characthers stand out and feel like a different family to you.It's because of them you'll be sad to see that this shows only has 12 episode (plus and OVA) and it's because of them you'll be glad there's a season 2\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nNow,before we go any further,I must say this about myself,this being my first review: I'm an otaku like most of you,and I like pretty much every anime that I end up watching.I end up liking some more than others,but I tend to like every show I watch because,well,it's anime and,most of the times,that's enough for me.That doesn't mean that aren't some exceptions,as there are some really bad shows out there.\\n\\n\r\nChuunybio is NOT an exception.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked this show overall.It's heartwarming,it's funny,it's sad and it makes you want to go out there and get yourself somebody to love.Maybe it came right when I needed it,but this show really spoke to me,and so I have to say I really enjoyed it.If I could erase it from my mind and watch it again,I would.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 8.8 --> 9\\n\\n\r\nBottom line is: Chuunybio is good.Very good in fact.If you are like me and a friend of you recommended it to you,you should go watch it now.If you are not like me and are trying to figure out if you should watch it,you sould go watch it as well.\\n",

About the society I live in. \r\nIt went from \"haha that was cringe-y and funny and cute!\" to \"I'm not crying you are!\" \r\nStory:\r\nThe story I gave a 10. It flowswell, the characters make sense inside it. There is an actual plot. Rikka's depth and Yuuta's past link well together. Everything ties up nicely with room for a second season (Which I will now watch)\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\n10 out of 10! In any seen portraying sadness or bottled emotion, was so heart wrenchingly gorgeous. The flow of the movement, the tears, the mannerisms and gestures. everything was so perfectly put together my heart felt like it was about to implode.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFor me, the sound got a 9. it was beautiful, especially in the scenes where there was music playing in the background. Everything worked well, however I couldn't imagine myself saying \"yeah I'd totally buy that on itunes and listen to it.\" It was still ,however, very nice music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCharacters were outstanding. I absolutely loved every one. Even smaller characters like Isshiki kun and Kumin. they were minor characters, yet they had their own story within the main plot. One that was adorable and simple. Nothing but a love interest. My favourite character was definitly Rokka and her older sister Touka. All the characters were lovable and easily worked well together. It made sense to see them together. it wasn't one of those groups that make you think \"i don't get how someone like that would be with someone like that\". I could easily see how they ended up being together all the time.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this anime and strongly recommend it to everyone out there who may be reading this.",

            "content": "Watching this anime was very captivating. I was hooked right from the beginning and couldn't stop watching it. From the beginning I could tell where it was going and I was very anxious to see it happen. The biggest reason I enjoyed the series so much was because of Rikka. She gets lost inside her world of delusions in order to deal with her pain. Her personality throughout the series and the next was so funny to watch and kept me smiling throughout most of the series. I became so attached to the character that whenever she was happy, so was I and when shewas sad, I too was sad. Yuuta is a boy who used to have the same delusions as Rikka but tries to escape is embarrassing past but cannot do that after meeting Rikka. And as the series goes on he learns that these delusions are more than just fun and games. The story between her and Yuuta was very intriguing and they work so well together. The pacing of the series was good and the addition of the other characters brought in more laughs and assisted Yuuta and Rikka in a necessary way. I enjoyed the series very very much and I was actually sad when I was finished. Rikka is adorable and hilarious and it's a shame she's only an anime character because I need a girl like that in my life. One of my favorite anime series and one of my favorite characters. Definitely worth watching if you're into silly teen romance.\\n\\n\r\nLikes:\\n\r\n-Absolutely love Rikka, one of my favorite characters I've ever seen, if there was any girl I'd want to be my love, it'd be someone just like her\\n\r\n-Every scene involving Rikka made me smile\\n\r\n-The deeper meaning behind Rikka's chunnibyou, it really made the series more emotional\\n\r\n-I'm not that into romantic series but the buildup to Yuuta and Rikka's relationship did have be glued to the screen waiting for it to happen\\n\\n\r\nDislikes:\\n\r\n-The make believe chuunibyou fights that occur in each episode, I thought it was funny the first time but got tired of it\\n\r\n-The fact that Rikka doesn't exist in my life",

If you're put off by the romance tag don't be. It holds a very small role in enjoying this show, the romance parts are good but they don't define the show in any big ways. The show is more a comedy and slice of life anime. So if you were put off by the romance tag don't be",

It's something about Chuunibyou that makes you feel things like embarrassment, joy and sadness etc. .What i liked about Chuunibyou was it's Unique characters and how they solve their problems in their own way while growing up. The joyful atmosphere while keeping the seriousness of the story. I also liked how Chuunibyou dealt with the romance between Togashi and Rikka. They're not normal just like their love its not normal and that's what makes it so fun to watch! So the short version it's a great show orhow I would describe its a comfortable show, Great to relax and watch it casually and when you're feeling down because I promise it will bring your spirit up! Hope you enjoy it as much as i did! :)",

            "content": "This series is quite unique from any slice of life/high school/romance anime, and is entertaining throughout the whole show. The comedy is sweet and funny, the characters easily loveable and deep to the point that they can be relatable to. \r\n The only downside is probably that it takes a while (like 6 episodes) to get from only light hearted comedy to full-on drama. \r\nIn short, this is what I think made this anime really special:\r\n- There is a lot of story packed into the 12 episodes of the anime. This keeps it from getting boring.\r\n- There is something in the anime for everyone: comedy/sliceof life/romance/fantasy(ish)/guy relationships/girl relationships/drama. \\n\r\n- ALL the characters are very deep, and completely loveable. I think the thing that made this series so emotional but light-hearted at the same time was the innocent and sensitive characters. \\n\r\n- The anime is quite unpredictable since it is so unique, and by the end when a certain character falls in love with a certain character, it leaves you shocked and overly happy at the same time. And you get to watch those character's friends give advice to those characters on how to progress in their relationship.\\n\r\n- The beautiful art that suits the genre of the anime really well\\n\r\n- All the characters get a lot of screening time, so you do learn a lot about them and not just the 2 main characters.\\n\r\n- The backstories behind each character is only slowly revealed throughout the whole anime, and you only know their full backstories by the very end of the last episode.\\n\r\n- A lot of character development happens. Some of the characters undergo a complete transformation from the beginning to the end of the anime (which will shock you and make you laugh), and some of them learn to accept things that they could not in the past. Hence the 10/10 for my character rating.\\n\r\n- Overall, the anime is totally unpredictable and original which I think is the source of all its other good qualities. The romantic relationship that forms is overly adorable (not annoying like some slow developing relationships, or unromantic because the characters aren't very deep) and its concept  of eight grader syndrome - \"Chuunibyou\" is interesting and hilarious, and possibly for some people, quite relatable to.\\n",

            "content": "Is Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai mindless moe or an awesome anime?\r\nFirst of all if you would rather watch the video version of this you can click this link --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yltDivxYEd0 \r\nTo answer the question if Chuunibyou is good we'll have to look at the story of this anime and the character of course. Just stating the obvious here but when we're talking about slice of life anime we're pretty much talking about the characters too when we talk about the story because the story can only be interesting if the characters in it are engaging because we're looking at the daily lives of thesepeople instead of having them transport to an interesting parallel universe or fictional world or the past or future or whatever kids these days are doing. So to state the story of a slice of life anime is good almost automatically means stating the characters are interesting ones to follow that leave you wanting to know more about them. So does Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai succeed storywise and character wise? \\n\\n\r\nThe beginning.\\n\r\nWe start off following Yuuta, a boy who used to suffer from something called chuunibyou also known as eight graders syndrome. This means he was living in his own delusional world referring to himself as Dark Flame Master. He had a bandage on his arm to protect the world because if it'd come off it'd perish everything and he wears weird clothes and make his own swords. When he's finally done with middle school and gets a new chance at a new school he's determined to get rid of his chuunibyou and have a normal school life fitting in with the rest of the class. Just thinking back on his own chuunibyou makes him cringe now. Because he's now getting one step closer to being an adult and that means cringing over our past mistakes and leaving them behind never looking back. He walks into this cute girl named Nibutani and he crushes on her. When he gets to class he finds out she's in his class too. So for him this feels like a fresh start and things couldn't be looking any better right now especially when he immediately makes a new friend, Isshiki, who sits behind him and they have a completely normal conversation. Everything seem to be going well so far until Rikka starts talking to him in class saying her Tyrant's Eye is reacting to his presence. He recognizes her behaviour in a blink. The dramatic way she talks, the way she describes herself, the way she's wearing an eyepatch just because, the way she's obviously lives in her own little world\u2026 it has to be chuunibyou. \\n\r\nHe wants to make sure he doesn't have to put up with her in order to have his normal school life the way he pictured it. The one thing he doesn't want is for people to associate him with the crazy girl in class. But of course after getting invited to a party and getting an opportunity to get popular he ends up walking Rikka home because they live in the same building and she doesn't know how to get there being new there and all. I think this was an important event because maybe if this didn't happen this whole anime could not have existed. This one event determined the rest of the course of this anime like a butterfly effect. Maybe if he would've gone to the party people would have liked him and he would've gotten cocky and shunned Rikka to keep his status or build on his image for the other people. Because people have a tendency to try to keep their status no matter how nice of a person they used to be. He would've probably avoided her altogether by focusing on his new friends. Then again if he would not have been liked by people he might have been the one to be shunned and then he would have lost his confidence in himself and there would've never been a club that they start later in the show because that would have just been plain awkward. Yuuta keeps treating Rikka like a child telling her she's a dummy and playfully hitting her on the head. Which makes it obvious to us just how innocent Rikka is if even the main character sees her as a child pretty much. By the end of the first episode he helps her move her stuff into the apartment and we see the start of a bond forming between Rikka and Yuuta even if it's just a little at this point. Near the end of the episode Rikka tells him the powers of Dark Flame Master is real and gets emotional when Yuuta keeps telling her it's not real and it's all made up as if he's denying his true self. For her he does his signature chant one more time which proves to us Rikka doesn't leave him cold even though he tries to hard to project it that way. The first time you watch this scene it's sad but the second time you watch the anime and you realize why Rikka has chuunibyou in the first place it's so sad how she's trying to hold on to this idea, this delusion. And how he's just shoving the fact that it's all not real all up in her face. \\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nRikka and Yuuta share a weird connection from the start. Even though they've only known each other for a day Yuuta understands Rikka in a weird way because he has gone through the same phase as her. Like this example where Rikka finds a cat and wants to keep him but she can't and he asks her why and she replies with: The priestess of the Unseen Horizon Overseers displays immune hypperreaction to chimeras. And Yuuta replies with: Oh so your sister is allergic to cats? So even though he doesn't want to give in to the chuunibyou he still thinks in a way it's easy for him to understand the language of it. Sometimes he even slips up doing his old routines without thinking it through. Rikka clings to Yuuta nonstop not giving Yuuta room to develop distance and steady his place as a normal guy. She follows him around even when he's trying to make the moves on Nibutani. When Nibutani is told about the cat Rikka found she directs them towards Kumin who might be the cats owner. She's not the owner of the cat but it does make them befriend Kumin who'll turn out to be the sweet and sleepy one of the bunch. When she finds out Yuuta used to have chuunibyou she doesn't get weirded out or act mean about it even more she acts like it's actually a really cool thing. At school Rikka is always being the loner being true to her own world so when other people try to approach her she just stays herself and starts talking about her delusions and scare people off. She pretty much has this huge wall around her for almost everyone. Even to her closest friend, Dekomori. In the third episode Dekomori gets introduced which will be the last important character that's introduced in this season. She plays as Rikka's servant seeing her as her big example and master. She also has a severe case of chuunibyou. She ends all of her sentences with desu. But she pronounces it like the english word death at least that's how japanese people will hear it. She's pretty \"special\" as well. Dekomori is obsessed with this book written by Forrest Summer which is basically a guide for chuunibyou sufferers and their world building pretty much. Truth is Nibutani wrote this book way back when and is also desperately trying to cover up her chuunibyou and hopes they never find out it was her who wrote it. She joins their club to make sure no one finds out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\n So now we know all of the main characters. We have Rikka, who has chuunibyou and clings to our main protagonist Yuuta. We have Yuuta who used to have chuunibyou and tries to be a normal guy at his school and fit in. We have Nibutani who is popular and one of the prettiest girls in class but also secretly used to have chuunibyou. We have Kumin who we don't know that much about other than she's really sweet and not judgemental and very very sleepy all of the time and is pretty much there for the convenience of some of the jokes. I think she's really cute but doesn't add much to the anime and could've been left out completely. I really wish the anime had either focused a little more on her so I'd be able to tell you more about her than just those really obvious traits even if they would've showed it in a subtle way or just left her out because it's a waste of screen time like this. Then have Dekomori who worships Rikka and is coo coo bananas and also has chuunibyou. They all join in a club. Then there's also Isshiki who's friends with Yuuta but never seems to be a real important character at one point even forgotten about by not only the viewers but also the main cast. He wants to be a cool guy but he fails by trying a little too hard and all in all he's not very memorable even though he does become a member of the club later on for a bit and has this ne heroic act where he shaves his head in order to save the others in class which was kind of dumb and I don't know why they added that part. \\n\r\nUsually Dekomori and Rikka mess around and make the delusions as real as possible, Kumin sleeps on the ground or wherever she can and Yuuta is the one keeping them all in line. Meantime Nibutani is worming and sliming her way in to getting her magic book back before anyone finds out she wrote it but gets found out soon anyways. Dekomori is the only one who doesn't believe she was the one who wrote it because she'd been admiring this person for so long. Thus Dekomori and Nibutani constantly get into fights from this point onward. And they get this running gag going. Which I think is also a nice touch. Even if you don't like the joke itself which most of the times isn't even funny just having something return again and again makes it feel like something familiar. It's like what they say about being lonely. Once you're so used to being lonely even when you do feel better you have a tendency to look up that loneliness in order to get back to a state you're familiar with because that has become something comfortable for you whether it feels good or not. And I feel like this also applies with bad jokes. When someone in your family always makes the same joke and you get tired of it at on point it just becomes a part of the family's image and when that person dies that'll be one of the stupid little things you'll miss about them. When you watch an anime with running gags that make you roll your eyes all the way back in your head and never even laugh about it and then you go back and watch the anime again after a year and you see the same jokes you get into it right away because that has become a weirdly cosy place all of a sudden. Maybe that's just me though. Or maybe that is one of the reason character tropes keep reappearing even when everyone has grown tired of it. \\n\r\nNibutani and Yuuta are struggling to get out of that phase while Rikka and Dekomori are having the time of their life with their chuunibyou and Kumin is just asking them questions like why Nibutani and Yuuta are not just giving into it and having fun so again Kumin is just there for the convenience of asking the questions we want answers to. The thing is that we can relate to these characters. It's tough growing up and letting go of your fantasies and innocence. For some people it's harder than others and some people choose to always be true to themselves even if a little childish. All of these characters have different ways of coping with growing up or stubborn feelings for something that has happened to them. Yuuta and  Rikka are developing their friendship into something more than just friendships as they make each other better people because Rikka is always anti-social and doesn't really know how to talk to people normally but Yuuta helps her overcome it by being somewhat harsh on her but talking to her in a way she understand by using his chuunibyou experiences. She makes him a better person to by having him be himself more. Even if he tries to be different or tries to grow up he should stay true to himself and Rikka kinda forcibly makes him do that. Nibutani's charactr could have been more fleshed out in my opinion as to why exactly she had chuunibyou and decided to give up on it after being as passionate about it as she was even writing a whole book about it. Dekomori's character could've been better if there was more depth to her than just her being obsessed with Rikka. Because apart from that we don't really know what she likes or what she was like before she had chuunibyou or even why she likes Rikka as much as she does. She's an enjoyable uplifting character but sometimes it feels a little artificial. So as far as characters go I'd say Isshiki and Kumin were not necessary and it's kind of aggravating to have them in there anyways and the other side characters could've maybe used more background but the main focus of the show, Rikka and Yuuta were done really well in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nReasons.\\n\r\nLater in the anime we find out Rikka's reasons for acting the way she does. I'll be spoiling some of the show now so if you haven't seen the anime I highly recommend skipping to the \"Art.\" section in this review. Bleep Bloop Blob. Oh you're still here? Rikka's father suddenly died two years ago and because it was so sudden for her she was never able to accept it. Ever since the beginning of the anime she kept talking about wanting to see the unseen horizon in her chuunibyou talk and we never really know what it means until we find out the whole reason she has chuunibyou in the first place. Unable to accept the fact that her father died she build up this imaginary world around her. She saw Yuuta doing his dark flame master impression on the day she lost her father and it inspired her to create her own delusional world. Being in her own world protects her from the reality that she's pretty much all alone except for her sister and her grandparents she never goes to see. Unable to cope with her feelings, the unseen horizon, to Rikka, is the place she thought to see her dad after he died. She said that she was one day watching the horizon and she was sure her dad was there beyond the horizon. Her sister wants what's best for Rikka and keeps trying to pull her into reality but it's just too hard. I think a scene that most beautifully displays Rikka's thinking is when she goes back to where her old house was and in her mind it is still there but her sister keeps talking her into reality and we can see the house slowly vanish from around her. As the house is slowly crumbling so are Rikka's delusions and it keeps getting harder not to face the truth.\\n\\n\r\nFalling in love.\\n\r\nThe way Rikka falls in love with Yuuta is really pure. She doesn't understand what exactly it is what she's feeling and it's overwhelming for her. It's hard for her to face these emotions and she shows that by literally running away from it in episode 9 making me ball my eyes out. She deals with it in her own childish ways not owning up to it even when Nibutani suggests she might have a crush on Yuuta. Nibutani then makes it her job to act like Rikka's wingman. Rikka's clumsy attempt to follow up on Nibutani's from shoujo manga extracted advice is very comedic to see and was in my opinion one of the funniest things in the show. Because we already got to see how clumsy Rikka is on a daily basis which caused for some laughs this was only to be expected but doesn't make it less entertaining. When Rikka faces the fact that she likes Yuuta she is determined to confess her feelings to him. Being a fairly shy person myself I can relate to the slow build up to the actual confession. It doesn't just come out like that. She goes places with him not really telling him what she has to say until they're outside and she doesn't have to look at his face while confessing to him. The satisfaction of seeing that scene it indescribable. When you're shy or have to say something that makes you very vulnerable it's so hard to put it into words but when you're able to do it it feels all the more satisfying you were able to. Giving you some sort of adrenaline. If you can connect to Rikka and you can place yourself in her shoes this scene is so much more than just pleasant to watch even if she hides behind her umbrella and behind her chuunibyou. Instead of declaring each other boyfriend and girlfriend they make a contract which basically means the same thing but it's their own special thing. In real life relationships are kind of like contracts as well. When you're with someone you have this unspoken contract consisting of deals you're okay with and what things you're not comfortable with. Like some people are comfortable with having their boyfriend or girlfriend spending a lot of time with friends of the opposite gender and other couples refrain from doing so because that doesn't make them happy as a couple. Every couple has their own reasons for feeling the way they do and if you can't understand and respect each others values and feelings there's not much of a relationship to speak of. I think chuunibyou does a great job at portraying the importance of understanding in a relationship and how much that adds to how well a relationship really works.\\n\\n\r\nNormality.\\n\r\nNear the end of the anime Rikka gets confronted with her mother who she's been avoiding because she's still angry at her for not telling her that her dad was going to die. Rikka's sister asks Yuuta to make Rikka stop hiding behind her chuunibyou and running away from her issues. Yuuta then convinces Rikka to stop wearing her eyepatch and to just behave normally. It's hard to like this part because we get to see how sad it makes Rikka to refrain from behaving the way she wants to. It is important for her to face up to these feelings because if she doesn't she may never get rid of these feelings inside. She will never be able to see her father again and that is something she'll just have to deal with. This of course initially make Dekomori angry and then sad because now she's the only one left living in her fantasy world as if she is being left behind which is heartbreaking in itself. You don't want to be that person left behind and the one that takes the longest to grow up. It's okay to take your time to grow up but society makes you feel like you can't and when all your friends are moving on it hurts deeply to be the one unchanged. Rikka starts blossoming and becomes friends with other girls in class. Although it is a good thing she's trying to be more social in my opinion it happened a little too fast. I don't believe in change overnight for someone so socially awkward as Rikka. You can't just take off your eyepatch and BAM you're a social bee. If this would've taken a longer time to develop it would've been heart-warming but it missed the mark for me because it didn't feel real. The thing about Rikka's change that bothers me the most is that she's not allowing herself to like the things she's passionate about. She's trying to be more mature and fit in more to what other people see as normal but she's turning into a whole different person letting go of all that she holds dear and makes her unique. She's not just focusing on overcoming her knack to hide er feelings but she's getting rid of her personality as a whole. Yuuta loves Rikka and he thinks it's better for Rikka to face reality so she can overcome her traumas but even for him it's a little heartbreaking to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe End.\\n\r\nRikka goes to her father's grave together with her mother coming to terms with the facts. I think this development was very important for her so she can finally move on. The problem is that she's moving there altogether so she's not only abandoned her true self but also all of her friends and Yuuta. Yuuta then takes his bike and decides to get Rikka back. I loved this scene because it reminds me of old movies where the guy always ends up making a big gesture towards the girl near the end. Kumin is waiting for him with a message telling him that Rikka had known Yuuta way before he knew her and had always thought of Yuuta and the chuunibyou as her savior. This gives their bond so much more meaning from her side and it explains why she was so fond of Yuuta from the beginning. It's refreshing because most of the times in anime we just get to see characters who like each other for nothing other than the convenience of it and the fact that people like to see romance rather than the characters actually having a reason for liking each other as much as they do having them grow towards each other naturally. Especially in harem anime this is a re accruing thing where girls falls in love with the mc for the sole reason that he is the mc. Sometimes even in ridiculous amounts like in to love ru where every girl who comes into contact with the main character falls for him like he had some sort of love potion. The ending scene is both visually as story-wise a beautiful and big ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\r\nOh the beauty of this anime. The character designs and the animation is just superb as expected of kyoto animation. The character design is very smooth the blushing of their cheeks is blended out so nicely it doesn't look like something's just been splashed on and the rounding of the eyes and face makes the characters look so much sweeter and more innocent which fits this show so well. The colour pallet was also very beautiful and fitting so much it doesn't even stand out in any way. It's just pleasuring and relaxing for the eyes. Even if it didn't have a story at all and it was just this animation with some music slapped on I'd probably still be enjoying it. I particularly enjoyed seeing the bouncy hair going all over the place. It wasn't too overly done so it wouldn't be anywhere near realistic anymore but it wasn't stiff like the hair was glued together. It felt like if you were too close to the screen you might get slapped in your face with the hair. Tiny bit exaggerated but everything in this anime moves so realisticly well even though the characters designs don't look very realistic at all. I also like how a lot of times in the anime we see reflections of the faces whether it is in windows or tablespoons. I don't know if it has anything to do with their inner self not always being what's being reflected on the outside but if it isn't symbolic I still found this a very nice touch. Also I like drawing and even though I'm not very good at it I enjoy it quite a bit and there is always this one thing I can't ever seem to get right and those are the hands. In this anime there are so many scenes emphasizing on the hands and feet it's amazing to see. Once I started noticing it I was in awe every time I looked at it. And the fact they made them move so easily was simply brilliant. The chuunibyou battles are fun to watch because you both get to see what's really happening as well as what's happing in their heads. Seeing this contrast drags us more into the story and into the minds of the characters as well.\\n\\n\r\nCliches.\\n\r\nThere's some obvious cliche's in this anime. I'll briefly mention a few because I do think it makes the show stand out a little less. You have the highschool where they form a club which is okay because it was fun to see this club and the activities I just wish they would've chosen another setting that was more refreshing because this just seems the easy way to go about it. There's also this milk joke I get really sick of seeing. And I know I said I like running gags but come on having a character dislike milk to get some moe moments out of it doesn't do anything for me anymore. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion.\\n\r\nI don't think Chuunibyou is mindless moe but I also don't think the story is overwhelmingly good. The development of Rikka and her character as a whole is in my opinion the best thing about this show and is really well done. I myself found this anime to be very appealing and liked it very much. But if nothing I said in this video made you slightly interested in the show I wouldn't recommend it from a perspective of how good the overall anime is counting every aspect of it.",

            "content": "Really sweet and very cute souls, with splendid drawings both for the characters and for the scenarios. Although it contains some typical elements of the sentimental genre, history has its own and original traits that make it interesting even in its simplicity.\r\nThe development of the various moments of the plot is very linear and balanced, without being boring or chaotic.\r\nVery interesting is the use of the theme of the game to discover itself as the fulcrum of the whole affair, that game which not only constitutes an important part of childhood, but which is important to discover precisely oneself and the adults that one willbecome: without this essential slice of everyone's life, it is not possible to serenely manage oneself in our formation, healthy, towards the age of choices, that journey that begins in adolescence and leads to the succession of moments of adulthood; it is thanks to the lightness with oneself, that is to say the serene cohabitation with one's most genuine and spontaneously childish sides in a good sense, that the protagonist will be able to distinguish between play and life, between unstable company between playmates ... It's love.\\n\r\n\u00a0The story opens on Yuuta Togashi, a high school student who wants to leave the second media syndrome behind. This is the sort of mental condition of the young Japanese people who imagine living in a fantasy world where they are sleeping warriors / wizards who fight evil. This will make them behave in a ridiculous way in the eyes of their peers, dressing up in a bizarre way to go to school, talking as if they were in a role play. Our protagonist Yuuta has overtaken this phase and decides to enroll in a high school where none of his old middle class classmates joined to be able to start from scratch. Things will get complicated for him when he meets a girl of his class, Rikka Takanashi, who still has the second-grade syndrome and who risks falling into his imagination too.",

            "content": "(Quick disclaimer, this is only a review for season 1)\r\nWe all have a part of our past that we\u2019re embarrassed of, pasts that we don\u2019t want to define the person we are now. We all have a side to us that some may find weird, sides that we wish to hide from everyone else. Some of us may even embrace that side no matter what anyone tells us. We may embrace it because we enjoy it, we truly believe it, or maybe because we\u2019re just running away from reality. No matter what that reason is Chuunibyou teaches us that there isn\u2019t anything wrongwith being a little different than others.\\n\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou, or \u201ceighth-grade syndrome\u201d as it is more commonly known, is an odd occurrence that affects children around the start of adolescence. Chuunibyou is typically, but not always, born from the desire to be special, to stand out to people. Chuunibyou can manifest itself in many forms, some of them more extreme than others, such as believing you have an ancient God inside you or believing you have hidden powers that you can barely control, to believing you have the knowledge of all your past lives. Yuuta Togashi is an ex-chuunibyou who enrolls in a high school so far away from his middle school that nobody he knew before should be there. He does this in an attempt to live a normal life and forget about his chuuni past. All seemed to be going well until he gets involved with the very much still chuunibyou, Rikka Takanashi. Rikka claims her right eye is a \u201cWicked Eye\u201d and wears an eyepatch to contain her powers, this, of course, is nothing but her own delusion getting the best of her. The story progresses as Rikka and Yuuta, along with some of their friends, live out their crazy lives together with all the weirdness that Chuunibyou brings. Despite the odd premise, one of the main themes of Chuunibyou is acceptance. It\u2019s about accepting people for who they truly are. It doesn\u2019t matter if people see you as a little weird. It doesn\u2019t matter if you stand out. You don\u2019t have to be like everyone. You can live your life as you, and be happy doing it. People will eventually accept and even grow to like you for who you are. You wouldn\u2019t expect an anime with such an odd premise to get deep at times, but it really does. I always appreciate when you have a story that doesn\u2019t take itself seriously, but still knows how to make really emotional meaningful moments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou has a cast of weird, but definitely lovable characters. You have the always airheaded Rikka Takanashi, who is without a doubt lost in her delusional world but does, in fact, realize that she is living in her own delusions. Her being self aware like that creates this odd situation where she\u2019s crazy, but is aware she\u2019s crazy, so even though she is crazy, she actually isn\u2019t. She\u2019s a really interesting character. Yuuta Togashi is a really good main character for the series. Seeing him try and forget about his Chuuni past, and even sometimes getting caught up in it again with the help of Rikka is always cute and fun to see. Yuuta tries to act mature, but you often see him get carried away with things and just have fun which makes him more endearing. The first person to talk to Yuuta when he arrived at high school, Makoto Isshiki, is hopeless when it comes to love, but that never stops him from trying. Yuuta often gives him a hard time but is grateful Isshiki gave him the time of day and became his friend. They do trust each other and their interactions often lead to really funny parts of the series. There\u2019s also Shinka Nibutani, elected number 1 in the class most beautiful girl competition. She\u2019s a girl everyone wants to be, or be with. This is how she seems on the surface, but after getting involved with the chuuni gang, she starts to show her true colors more. She\u2019s a lot blunter when she speaks, even harsh at times. She also often gets in fights with Sanae Dekomori, another chuunibyou and one of Rikka\u2019s only friends as well as her faithful servant. Dekomori acts childish most of the time but is actually very intelligent. Her \u201cpower\u201d is Mjolnir, her twin tails that she swings around like nunchucks.  There\u2019s also Kumin Tsuyuri, the professional napper of the group. Kumin is a bit of an odd character. She usually goes with the flow and acts obviously, but there are times when she acts like the upperclassmen she is to the gang and helps them out when they need it. Because of this it is a bit hard to get a grasp on her character at times. This character section went a little long so I\u2019ll just talk about Rikka and Yuuta\u2019s families together. I really enjoy an anime where the main cast actually has family around. Rikka\u2019s sister Toka really wants her to break from her delusions because she cares about Rikka and wants her to face reality and live a normal life. She tries to break Rikka from her delusions with force, this leads to Rikka believing her sister is evil. Yuuta family is unfortunately not shown much, but I always laugh at Toka\u2019s interactions with his youngest sister, Yumeha. Yuuta also has another sister, Kuzuha, who\u2019s slightly younger than him, but gets more or less no screen time. Same is true for his mother and father, with the exception that his father gets absolutely no screen time and is only talked about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Chuunibyou is gorgeous. It\u2019s colorful, fluid, there isn\u2019t really any noticeable drops in quality, and all around looks great. Where the art really stands out is how they use the visuals to sell certain jokes, or just make something funny happen in the background. I laughed so many times from just the simple unnecessary things they animate, it just makes everything so much funnier and charming than it has a right to be. The visuals when we get to see through the eyes of our chuunies is also great. It\u2019s like Chuunibyou suddenly decides to become an action anime, before reminding you that it\u2019s a comedy by showing what\u2019s actually happening outside the character\u2019s delusions.\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have much to say about the opening or ending songs. The opening, \u201cSparkling Daydream,\u201d fits the anime well enough. We get to see a little bit of the characters personalities throughout, which is always a plus. This opening is also the origin of the popular \u201cRikka Finger Spin\u201d meme so of course, I need to mention that.  The ending song, \u201cInside Identity,\u201d is a lot more intense in both visuals and music compared to the opening. Nothing against the opening, but I find Inside Identity to be more catchy and overall just more enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI just want to do a small section here dedicated to the VAs. These Characters are voiced perfectly. I want to give special attention to Yuuta, Rikka, and Dekomori\u2019s VAs, but really everyone did an amazing job. Chuunibyou also has a pretty solid dub, which I\u2019d also recommend.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFrom beginning to end Chuunibyou is a funny, beautiful look through all the weirdness that this \u201cdisease\u201d can bring. For all of its comedy and crazy antics, there is a lot we can learn from Chuunibyou. We can learn that there isn\u2019t any wrong with living in your own world, you just need to have the courage to face reality as well. Regardless of what anyone thinks, just be yourself and be happy, your happiness is the most important thing after all. This was my second time watching through it and I loved it so much more than I did the first time. I watched Chuunibyou for the first time probably about 5 years ago at this point. Man, time flies. With all that being said, this was just my opinion. My opinion isn\u2019t any more or less valid than anyone else\u2019s. As always I highly recommend you watch it for yourself and form your own opinions. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you so much for your time, I really appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\nI give Chuunibyou 9 wicked lords out of 10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Actually i didnt cry, but get really closer. Anyway, is really amazing how you get involve by the story. The ideia that we all past by this situation (or should pass) where we live in world so much better inside our head sounds so sad. It's really awful see how when we get old we are just too embarrassed for admit it. Is sad think that we just letthis all go, when the truth is that is part of who we are. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nI love the story line. It didnt get out of the point, or lost the ideia they wanted to pass. The plot was really funny and very emotional. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI love it. One second we are \"inside\" the head of the character, and the other we a back to reality, the art was amazing doing this change, is really pretty to see. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThey are pretty easy to love. I admit that i didnt like Nibutani at first, but she reveal herself as a great character. Rikka and Yuuta was also great as main character is kind of easy to like. So i guess i can say that all the main character was very easy to love and i really want to know more about them.\\n\r\nIt has very good suporting character too, Touka and Yuuta's sister was pretty fun too see.\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou was awesome, this why i give it a ten, i can think in bad things to say about it.",

            "content": "This is an anime that I guarantee will make you laugh at least once. \r\nI decided to watch this show because I heard that Kyoto Animation was a part of it; I knew at that moment that this show would be aesthetically pleasing. Thankfully it was. I guess the only ones that would hate the art are those that extremely abhor innocent, cute, childish looking faces. \r\nOne of the best things that Kyoto Animation did was the fighting scenes. Whenever Dekomori and Rikka were in their imaginary world, believing that people were conspiring against them, it was entertaining to watch the graphics. Those scenes wereextraordinary, and it was actually better than some action genre animes\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I had with the art was the opening theme. I felt like the company tried so hard making a dance sequence with an upbeat music;. It failed; it was a cheap duplicate of the popular Haruhi opening. The flashes and the jump-cuts strained my eyes, and gave me headaches.  BUT! At least the ending was done nicely. The song, the movement, and the dark element were a huge contrast to what the show was about when it first started. (Although I loved the ending theme, I cannot help but feel that it is a replication of another anime Kyoto animation produced.)\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nAs for the characters, most of them actually developed by the end of the short series.  \\n\\n\r\nWhen I first started this show, Yuuta seemed like the typical teenage boy who really wanted to be popular. It annoyed me because the main character was so ordinary. This is the type of character I don't ever want to see have the stage. The question of why does he deserve to be the hero kept circulating in my head. Why was he special? Thankfully, they did give me an acceptable answer in the last two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nRikka is the star of the show (she is the one affected by the 8th grade syndrome.). She'll make you laugh, and she'll make you upset. But, I still think her character progressed abruptly.  I wouldn't expect anything more since the show was 12 episodes, but I guess the thing that bothers me is that Rikka had so much potential to be an amazing character! Furthermore, at the end, she depended way too much on Yuuta when her problems could have been solved more properly by herself. Maybe, I should have just been satisfied because this anime was meant to be about romance.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other three supporting characters, they also had some important roles in this anime. I did find that they were the archetypical characters. Some people might find this a nuisance, but I felt that the writers did bring some originality into these characters. I thought Dekomori and the sleepy girl were hilarious!\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nThe storyline could have been gold. If it were more than 13 episodes, I think they could have made something extremely special. At first, when they mentioned the 8th grade syndrome, it reminded me of \u201csenioritis\u201d; the last year of school when you simply do not care what happens. The \"wild\" side of you just comes out. It happened to me! And just like the characters, I totally wanted to forget all the childish things I did in my senior year of high school. However, my story is different from theirs. As the anime progressed, the 8th grade syndrome seemed to only engulf certain types of people. In my opinion, the imaginative side that came along with the syndrome is what helped the characters live freely and openly.  By the end of the anime, you realize that there are things that are not meant to be forgotten. Conformity won't always satisfy your cravings of happiness.  \\n\\n\r\nAlthough this anime was hilarious and seemed to have an overall amazing message, I disliked that they left all the sadness for the end. I know the ending was meant to be the climax, but the drama ruined the atmosphere of the show. At one point, I started to get bored of the romance and the storyline. But, I'm glad there were a few burst of comedy in between the melodrama. \\n\\n\r\nAnother annoying part of this series was the last episode.. The conclusion did not really solve anything. Even though they made the problem seem small, I believe the 8th grade syndrome needs a proper solution. How can the characters function in their society if they choose to live in their imaginary world?   .\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nDespite the cons of this anime, I did enjoy watching it. It was so hilarious and clever that I kept waiting impatiently for the next episodes to come out!\\n",

            "content": "What is considered normal? For instance, if your best friend in middle school started showing up with an eye patch and bandages, are they crazy? Apparently not, they just have a heavy case of chuunibyou- a \"disease\" that typically surfaces around eighth grade where one starts acting in a way which society in general may frown upon. This series explores a group of people who have gone through or are going through chuunibyou, and perhaps possible root causes of it.\r\nThis is a unique, exploratory piece that fits quite closely with Denpa Onna, differing primarily in that there aren't any magical/supernatural elements (other than those inthe head of chunnibyou sufferers). Chuunibyou doesn't go very far plot-wise, fitting as an interesting slice of life with both comedic and romantic elements interspersed in meaningful and entertaining ways. As others have noted, it's a great time killing series as it's not terribly serious most of the time yet entertaining enough to keep you watching. Overall, Chuunibyou was an unexpected surprise full of meaningful characters and exciting interactions.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nAt times overly plain, at others masterful, Chuunibyou's animation can be a mixed ride. Most of the time, the quality is very good with adequate coloring and lighting. What really sets this series apart from others is its attention to details (character expressions and actions) and depiction of what one sees from a chuunibyou's point of view. The characters are all unique in their appearance and have some pretty interesting wardrobes. Siblings, even, look unique to the point that I question they share the same bloodline.\\n\\n\r\nAction is surprisingly present in this seemingly plain series. To start, there are a lot of violent characters in this series. Many of the characters, including our protagonist Yuuta, will repeatedly hit other characters with attacks ranging from a light karate chop to rage-filled violent shaking. Then there are the imaginary battles where chunnibyou suffers wield giant human-sized weapons and attack each other with odd named attacks and energy projectiles. In the \"real world\", our Yuuta observes them attacking each other with brooms, umbrellas, etc... As all this action is mostly not \"real\", there isn't any gore/blood here. The series also introduces the outrageous notion that you can have a light series with some romance/drama without significant fan service.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show starts with a crisp, open song with electronic elements. The melody isn't too great and the singer sounds like she's hitting the limits of her abilities at times, but more importantly- you'll most likely end up skipping it as the OP sequence is headache-inducing with it's two-paneled animation approach. The ED, sung by the cast, is a more fitting piece with interesting personality and relevant lyrics. Unfortunately, the BGM is nowhere near as impressive as that in Denpa Onna. The series makes up a bit through strategic use of appropriate sound effects to give accent to particular humorous moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting cast is superb. Yes, everyone sounds silly taking in meaningless riddles that only they themselves can understand but the VAs really worked hard to ensure the lines didn't sound dry or generic. Maaya Uchida does a great job as Rikka coming off of a likewise great job as Sanka Rea. Relatively new Sumire Uesaka does a great job as well as Dekomori, who actually sounds like she has a light foreign accent on top of being under the spell of chuunibyou.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThere are way too many school-based, slice of life series focusing on a particular group of friends. This is one of those few shows that reaffirms that this category isn't quite dead yet. It keeps itself from being binned as \"just another\" through clever character interactions and great execution mixing comedic and romantic elements just enough to keep the mood light. So our protagonist, Yuuta, is a freshman in high school. He purposely moved to a distant school to ensure that he would be able to put his chuunibyou memories behind him. Unfortunately for him, there is a girl named Rikka who still suffers from chuunibyou, and who quickly takes an interest in Yuuta. Much like in Haruhi, Yuuta and Rika form a club for doing chuunibyou-type activities. Are Yuuta's normal high school dreams now a distant memory?\\n\\n\r\nChuunibyou has a very simple, single plot line. The only thing distracting you from this is the well-executed humor and drama between the primary characters. The majority of the show is relatively light with lots of humorous moments but the last few episodes takes a more serious turn as the characters confront their chuunibyou syndrome, and why they're acting so differently than everyone else. Towards the end of the show, some characters themselves start getting philosophical and it brings up a good question- wouldn't you rather live true to yourself rather than live according to what society deems normal?\\n\\n\r\nYes, not much happens in this show. However, the execution and pacing are both outstanding, and given this genre's history for having to resort to sci-fi or other crazy elements just to keep things interesting, I applaud this series, its cleverness, and its simple message.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIt's been a while since I've seen characters as interesting and well rounded as those in Chuunibyou. From the fantasy dreams of Yuuta to the outlandish chuunibyou hallucinations, the series goes out of its way to give you a unique perspective of situations, rather than using generic narration. The primary characters mostly consist of chuunibyou victims and former victims. This is key as you have those currently experiencing the syndrome mixing with those desperate to rid themselves of their embarrassing past. Throw into this already interesting mixture an assortment of developing romantic interests and you've got yourself a very entertaining character picture. From the childish Dekomori to the surprising Nibutani, you won't be bored with this cast. Expect great character development, cool style, and significant romantic progression.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nChuunibyou will not be remembered for great music, awe-inspiring animation, or climactic plot line. However, it has a very real message buried underneath an entertaining presentation and very lively character set. I definitely recommend giving this series a try. Banishment, this world!",

Probably the best representation of a coping mechanism for the fear of growing up. I really enjoyed this anime, the plot, characters, animation, and the ending. While some animes tend to break and leave a concluding episode that doesn\u2019t really address the main theme, Chuunibyou keeps it\u2019s shit together. Matter a fact they put it right in front of you and tear it open so blatantly that you relate and cry from yourfeels being so overwhelmed.  I feel like that an anime about growing up and trying to be yourself while battling your own consciousnesses can easy be boring and generic. Especially when tying in a bit of romance.  But Chuunibyou kept the plot interesting and didn\u2019t smother it and beat it to death with the love concept, honestly if Rikka and Yuuta\u2019s relationship had pressed earlier it would\u2019ve ruined everything because it was Yuuta\u2019s confidence that gave Rikka her escape not their love for each other.  But still their relationship played an important roll with Dekomori, which I love because it\u2019s not the reason for their own issues it\u2019s someone else\u2019s. They brought in all different types of relationships and personalities and spiced up how a normal situation could have been handled. I highly recommend this anime to anyone. It\u2019s an easy watch, great story, and highly entertaining.  At first I wasn\u2019t really into it but after a few episodes I came to love it.",

He even chooses the only school where he knows that no one will know him from his past. While it seems that fate would not let him leave that era of him behind because on a fateful night Rikka Takanashi (Pictured) drops down onto his balcony. He helps her down and she continues on, leaving him confused only to wonder what happens next. Well Rikka decides that our protagonist (Yuta Togashi) is the one tohelp her on her spectacular quest to find the Invisible Barrier Lines. Yuta was hoping to leave this life of Magic and Imagination in the past, but Rikka and company are going to make sure that isn\u2019t what happens. Overall, it is a tale of wanting to grow up, the sacrifices we make, and the choices of who dictates our happiness.\\n\\n\r\nThe art direction in this show is absolutely gorgeous. Everyone moves very fluid and there is purpose with every single movement. The faces show emotion rather than just spit out words with a stone face. Their hair moves with the wind and them as they speak, and overall it is a pleasant viewing experience that helps one invest in the characters. Each character has something that makes them unique and identifiable and that\u2019s something I really appreciate. I found myself drawn to one character or another for various reasons that made the entire cast as a whole so easy to relate to. Also, it is important to add that while fan art might show a lot of fan service, there is really little to none in the show itself!\\n\\n\r\nMusic is something that is important to have in any show, but especially in a show like this where there are quite a few key moments that without proper music would fall short of the amount of emotion that is trying to be conveyed. And this Love, Chunibyo, and Other Delusions hits the nail on the head with it\u2019s music. Both the opening and the ending tracks are fantastic (I prefer the opener myself) and I found it hard to skip through them when I was short on time trying to watch an episode or two.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first encountered this show as an ad in the back of a magazine, I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of it. \u201cThe art style is cute and the girl had an eye patch so that\u2019s a bit weird\u201d is what I thought. I put it on my list and forgot about it for a while. then finally, some months later I find it after a string of shows that are just fantastic and with high hopes I went into Love, Chunibyo, and Other Delusions hoping to be dazzled, and this show did not disappoint. It was hilarious exactly where it should be and at times I nearly began to cry because of the events unfolding. I felt so connected with this show that I began to only think of how I remember my Chunibyo phase (if I got out of it is for another time I suppose). But I urge those reading this, we have all been the kid who is cosplaying at 12 years old and fighting the monsters from our favorite shows in the backyard, and some of us still do it today! The point is this show will tug at your heartstrings and it will make you want to bring out the Chunibyo that is still deep down.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 10/10\\n",

            "content": "Hey guys just finished watching a strong ending! I could be happy with this show only being one season of 12 episodes because Kyoto Animation made those 12 episodes count. I mean, how do you follow it up without people grousing about the lack of plot, \"it wasn't as good as last season\", etc...\r\nI am a sap for a good story and this ending had me teared up most of the way through it. Rikka's internal suffering of what she has lost becoming 'normal' and her decision to move back in with her Mom and Grandparents, while leaving Yuuta behind. \r\nYuuta's letter to himself inthe future with the important last sentence \"You are special\". Kumin's explanation to Yuuta on the road about how Rikka gained her chuunibyou from observing him when he was younger [I knew that flashback had significance! ;-)] Yuuta's encounter with the 'normal' Dekamori and Nibutani's sudden deep thought on the nature of how chuunibyou and normalcy are flip sides of the same coin \"believing you are special (chuunibyou) to believing you are not (normal)\".\\n\\n\r\nThe sequence when Yuuta got to Rikka's grandparents house and their escape were brilliantly done and conveyed so much emotion, I tear up thinking about it as I write this. The powerful goodbye from Rikka to her father, so sad, but necessary to move on with her life.\\n\\n\r\nSome thought the other characters being there at Rikka's house was contrived, but I don't think so. The Oriental Magik Napping Society in Summer attracted people who ultimately became friends. I don't think it is contrived to believe that friends would want to help and support each other in a time of need. ;-)\\n\r\nAll in all, I am sad to see it end, but very happy it ended the way it did. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I would be eager to see a second season, they did a great job wrapping up the first season to a satisfying conclusion that would stand the test of time and truly a must see ^v^",

            "content": "I wasn't sure what to have expected when I started watching this anime series. I went ahead having no knowledge of it, except for the fact that it had a high rating on MAL. This little slice-of-life creation reminded me a lot about The Bridge to Terabythia in the sense that is had to do with young ones using their imagination to deal with the problems or hardships in their lives. At least that's how it was for the female main character. The characters were cute and funny. One can't help but feel nostalgic, contemplating on their youth and how back then imagination was everything.\r\nThereare many things one can relate to with this story. Finding a way to deal with and cope with hardships and also trying to escape from one's embarrassing past. I remember how hard it can be to be young and foolish, and also naive. The story ultimately took a turn and got REAL heading toward the end. I felt very sad and hurt and there was a mixture of sympathy and understanding.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was good and enjoyable overall so I gave it an 8. The art was also very nice, especially concerning the fantasy battle scenes. This were beautiful so i gave it an 8. The sound was not all that very memorable to me, but it also wasn't particularly bad, so I gave it a 7. There was good character development and the characters were very likeable and they were not too childish especially considering their age. I was surprised at how grown up they handled things. Truly coming of age. So I gave that an 8 as well. OVERALL, I decided to give this anime a solid 8.",

            "content": "Im gonna say this before I even begin so you guys have a general idea of what my opinion's POV will be like. Chuunibyou Demo Koi ga Shitai is my favorite anime of all time and if you do not wanna here a passive review of this anime, then this is the wrong review for you.\r\nFirst of all, everything about this anime is perfect (to me). The characters are very lively and full of personality, the story is heartwarming and, even if it makes you cringe for a while, you yourself could relate to and under stand the problems that the characters face. The visualsof this anime are amazing too, with its pretty linear design, it just has some warmth to the animation and the art in general. \\n\\n\r\nI would just like to point out that the Dub for this anime is very good and would encourage to watch it. The sub also is fantastic but doesn't, to me, seem to fit with the story. I needed to point out the Dub for really one reason. The Dub just made the anime more fun to watch. In my opinion, you should only watch an anime if you have no problem staying up all night to watch it, and the dub makes this anime better just because of the personality behind it. Although much of the dialogue is changed and isn't the same exact script as in the Sub, many American cultural aspects are used in the Dub so if you are American, you can appreciate these jokes and I encourage you to watch the dub if you are.\\n\\n\r\nIn my reviews, I try not to point out the story and in general try to convince you to watch the anime without any info what so ever. In this case, some info needs to be given. First of all, this is a  \"Slice-Of-Life\" anime, so there will be a lot of things that you and I can relate to and remember back to. Also, this falls under the romance genre of anime so if you are not into romance-heavy story, then this is not your type of thing.\\n\\n\r\nJust a section for the characters, they are the focal point of this anime. Their personalities and back-stories are what drive this anime and really makes you feel for them in a way different from any other anime. It just feels organic, like you are there actually watching the anime unfold. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai is my favorite anime that I have watched so far. This and the second season are phenomenal, but the first season is far better than the second. I must say though, if you are more of a drama-lover, then the first season is for you. But, the second seasons \"Chuunibyou Demo Koi ga Shitai Ren\" is mainly driven by romance, but both are amazingly well done either way. The characters, music, art, its all here. Really, I have not enjoyed an anime to this extent before. If you have not watched this anime, give it a shot. I guarantee that there will be at least something that you will enjoy during the show.",

            "content": "Well, this one surely made me reflect about how boring my life is. Since I became an adult, I forgot how wonderful is to have something to believe and admire, eventhough it doesn't exist. Is it really worthy growing up? Maybe we could all be happier if our imagination didn't fade away when we less expected it...\r\n{STORY - 9/10}\r\nThis anime is focuses on explaining this \"chuunibyou\", or \"eight grade syndrom\", a psichological disorder that affects highly-influenciable pre-teenagers. Those described to play lots of videogames and watch too much anime are said to be weak-willed and then, being unable to distinguish reality from their own worlds,they can't socialize very well.\\n\\n\r\nYuuta suffered from it and starting High School on a place far away from his previous classmates would be the perfect opportunity to start over, make friends and enjoy a normal life. This was his plan, until an unexpected encounter with Rikka, a girl that still suffered from chuunibyou, changed everything.\\n\\n\r\nWith the sole objective of finding the \"Ethereal Horizon\", Rikka founded a club, along with Yuuta, to research magic. A few more members would be accepted, but its main purpose was only aimed by both Rikka and Sanae. On the meanwhile, Yuuta tries to understand why Rikka still has chuunibyou and a beautiful love story takes focus after some time.\\n\\n\r\n{ART - 9/10}\\n\\n\r\nOverall art impressed me. However, all the imaginary battles draw a lot of my attention. Eventhough they aren't real, we can see amazing effects and magic casting, side by side with intense movements and attacks on exciting combat sequences. Both OP and ED themes are really nice and original. The use of a subtle design for both characters and scenarios was the right choice, perfect combination!\\n\\n\r\n{SOUND - 10/10}\\n\\n\r\nIt's possible noticing a very strong dedication on making a suitable backgrounding for most scenes. All songs are well chosen for all situations and effects used on battles earlier mentionated just makes them mlre thrilling. Songs featured on both OP and ED themes are incredibly matching!\\n\\n\r\n{CHARACTERS - 7/10}\\n\\n\r\nBoth Yuuta and Shinka are students trying to forget their embarassing past, when they suffered from chuunibyou. They want normal lives, and Yuuta tries to make Rikka accept reality, even if this means destroying her dreams.\\n\\n\r\nRikka is the trigger to all this confusion. She hides her emotions behind this \"Evil Eye\" disguise and getting closer to Yuuta quickly awakens her deepedt feelings. She admires Yuuta and he's also one of her reasons to act the ways she does.\\n\\n\r\nRikka's \"servant\", Sanae, also suffers from chuunibyou and joins her on this quest for the Ethereal Horizon. She seems to have the most concern on Rikka's life and struggles to keep everything the way it is.\\n\\n\r\n{ENJOYMENT - 10/10}\\n\\n\r\nLearning something new from an anime is always good, but getting emotive and amazed is even better! Combining comedy with drama and romance is quite simple. However, a perfect match is tough and they did it. I can't say how much I loved this one!\\n\\n\r\n{OVERALL - 9/10}\\n\\n\r\nEveryone as a child wants to quickly grow up and make everything adults do, be free, have the \"real fun\". This is way wrong. You can't give up on your inocence just to look more mature. That's what makes youth so vivid, happy, full of hope... Dreams are important and some imagination isn't bad at all... This anime teaches us to not let who we are behind, to keep believing, to see beauty on our actions and on this world. Because seeing what others don't understand makes us unique... It may be childish, but is a whole better than living a dull life...",

            "content": "I'm rewriting this review, as of 30/9/2015. Deal with it, I'm rewriting it. I criticized a different anime in my previous review, and I done it too much, so I'm rewriting it. You cannot figure out what the previous anime I criticized was, unless you read my old review.\r\nChuunibyou Demo Koi ga Shitai! is one of my favorite romance/harem/comedy anime, because of the reasons that is completely hilarious, and can have some cute moments at times. There were a few sad moments in the show, but not enough to overwrite the comedy.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nTakanashi Rikka is the wielder of the Wicked Eye, and is trying toget to the Unseen Horizon... she thinks. She's affected with chuunibyou, which I didn't know existed til' I saw this anime. Chuunibyou stands for \"Eighth Grader Syndrome\" which makes you think you're somebody you aren't, I guess. I don't actually know if this exists, but it's a thing in this anime. Togashi Yuuta used to suffer from chuunibyou, but recovered mysteriously.\\n\\n\r\n Togashi Yuuta is the same seiyu as Lelouch Lamperouge from Code Geass, you'll know what I mean when you hear him as his other personality \"Dark Flame Master\". Yuuta used to think he was the Dark Flame Master, and he wanted to put that in his past, but Takanashi Rikka came into his life and kinda ruined it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and the animation is fascinating, it's beautiful and I love it so much that I didn't ditch the anime. I don't ditch many anime because of their art style, because I give every anime a chance, no matter their art style... Except maybe Vampire Holmes, that art style wasn't bad, the anime itself was just horrible. I'm allowed to criticize this one, because barely anyone likes it. I saw about 4 people rated in 1 in a row.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is noticeable in some scenes, and in most scenes. Makes no sense, but who cares. The soundtrack is fascinating and I would listen to it if I had spare time, but I'm too busy watching anime and reading manga, so I can't.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of the series, the characters. Every character in Chuunibyou is very unique and awesome, I love em' all. Takanashi Rikka is my favorite character in the series, because, well, she's just awesome. Next would probably be Dekomori Sanae, because she's so cute, and yes, that's a valid reason. After that would be Togashi Yuuta, Nibutani Shinka and then Kumin Tsuyuri. Isshiki Makoto is non-existent, because he randomly turned black in one of the episodes. I had no idea what the fuck just happened in that episode. All the characters are great, the main characters are just in my top... 5. Of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI give the series an overall 10/10 it wasn't a masterpiece but... nah, just kidding. In my eyes, it's a masterpiece, it's truly fascinating, and the second season is okay, but I like this first one better. Chuunibyou Demo Koi ga Shitai! will be one of my favorite romance/harem series for a long time, unless they make a third season which tops off the first two. But, it's still part of the Chuunibyou series, so, yeah.",

Now when I read the summary, I kind of thought it was a decent idea, I might as well watch it. \r\nWhat a waste. It's a pure cringe worthy show and I'd rather watch Breaking Bad then this crap. This show fails to meet any expectations except but I will say the art was quite wonderful, I ratherdid enjoy the visual production of the anime, that was probably the only upside to the show. That aside, it was pure cringe. I found myself pausing at least once in each episode to prevent my spine from doubling over. \\n\\n\r\nI won't go into any exquisite details, but I will say the characters are like watching little children. Now watching little children isn't too bad is it? Well, they're freaking high school students. That's what's cringe, this show took the whole idea of \"syndrome\" way too far and dramatized it to the point where it ruined the show completely.",
