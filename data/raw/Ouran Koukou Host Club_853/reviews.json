            "content": "Character(s) & Their Development\rEvery character is based with a sterotype near the beginning of the series. The real question though is if the characters actually grow out of their set roles. After watching the whole series that's both a yes and a no. It all comes down to the fact that the manga is still going and the characters are still maturing in that format; thus, they can only grow so far in the anime without making it a new story entirely. Sure, they stay towards their first impressions but, there are a handful of episodes that explain each Host Club member and their reasoningbehind attitude, outlook, and for joining the club in the first place.\\n\\n\rA keen example is Tamaki and his feelings for Haruhi. In the beginning, he takes on a father role towards her and the audience is made to believe that this is only part of his nature; however, the viewers should realize that this is because of the feelings he holds for her. Even Tamaki doesn't understand it and in episode twenty-three is forced to question it. He probably can't comprehend his feelings in the end, but he seems to establish some understanding towards Haruhi. Really, characters do grow but they tend to have done a lot of growing before the show was established, and quite a few past experiences are explained through-out the episodes. Either way, the audience is given the chance to fall in love with the characters before they begin to change, which adds a nice and smooth transition.\\n\\n\rAnimation\\n\rI've found people complain at the lack of the details made towards the characters themselves. Then again, how much detail do you want on a character that's about to turn chibi on your ass? Seriously, the animators did a wonderful job at finding a keen balance between common and glorious so that when a touching moment is needed, the characters have that necessary lovely animation & while during the hyper-active moments, the characters are bouncy and have a jelly-like movement.\\n\\n\rOne thing that caught my attention after reviewing certain episodes was how detailed the background could be. I hadn't noticed it on the first run through due to how into the show I was; however, if you pay attention, you really notice how wealthy the animators attempted to make the school look. Look at the ceilings and the inscriptions into it, that's pretty damn detailed to me.\\n\\n\rMusic\\n\rI was iffy about the music in the beginning. Once I heard the first line of the opening, Sakura Kiss, I felt the catchiness; however, after listening to the whole thing I wasn't direly impressed. The ending song, Shissou, I didn't like at all. It just sounded like normal Japanese rock. I was disappointed even more when I found LAST ALLIANCE was the band who preformed it because they could have done a lot better.\\n\\n\rRegardless, I gave the music a chance and got a copy of the available soundtracks. While watching the show I found the melody coordinated with many places perfectly, surely in the Ouran world the music full of rich violins, playful piano, and elegant harp was a match made in heaven. In it\u2019s own way everything works... but that ending song.\\n\\n\rDubbing/Subbing\\n\rSince there is no dubbing released, I can't comment on that; however, the subtitles by Lunar Anime provided on their fansub were wonderfully done. Generally, I don't like to comment on subtitles because what's there to say, but what I liked was how many notes were provided to get said joke. It was also produced very nicely for the English audience.\\n\\n\rOverall\\n\rSimply, Ouran High School Host Club is just a fun old time. It's got the wackiness to pull you into a fit of giggles, but at the same time enough character development to move along with a pretty random plot. I was going to skip this series entirely because I tend to avoid popular shows now-a-days; however, in the end I'm glad I didn't. This was certainly worth my time and I guarantee it's worth yours, too. It's hard to find a character or a part that you plainly didn't like. So, unless you're extremely nit-picky, then there shouldn't be a problem to enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\rThere are lots of laughs and pretty boys waiting for you at the Host Club so what are you reading this review for?",

            "content": "Ouran High School is one of the best reverse harem anime series I have watched. The first episode really made an impact. It did not start as to be draggy but rather it easily showed the main idea of the story which started when they have discovered that Haruhi is a girl. The story was quite shallow at first which was just showing the different themes of the club and how they entertained the guests but when you continue with the later part of the series, you'll realize that behind all the smiles of the characters, there is a bitter past. The flow of thestory is also good. It starts with the story of a certain character, followed by an episode just for enjoyment, them the story of a certain character and so on which promoted the balanced flow of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this anime is great since they can convene the different effects for a specific situation correctly. The type of animation used was the traditional type of animation (not the 3D or any modern form of animation) which for me, was better since the traditional type of animation was a type wherein the viewers can interpret more using their own imaginations.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song Sakura Kiss (which became my favorite) sung by Chieko Kawabe was really fitting for the series since it was lively and the lyrics can really relate to the main character which was Haruhi Fujioka. The ending song Shissou sung by Last Alliance was great in which it blended with the appeal of the club.\\n\\n\r\nI like the way they treat each other. They treat each other as close friends not some enemy that is to be competed financially or in other aspects (which was the opposite of what their parents really want). Each of the character's qualities complimented the others that's why their host club was in harmony. Other characters are also shown who were either supporting or testing the  strength of the bond between the host club members.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching this anime, I might have looked like i was crazy or something coz i kept on laughing out loud everytime there is something really really funny like the thing that happened during their host club ball and the ever-changing characteristic of Tamaki Suou. The &quot;punch lines&quot; and &quot;Labels&quot; also help a lot in expressing the humor of the series like in the part of Kyouya who just recently woke up from bed was placed title as a &quot;Low Blood Pressure Evil Lord&quot; and Haruhi was labeled &quot;Studious Commoner&quot; and the host club's &quot;DOG&quot; at the very start of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a lot of laughs mixed with a mixture of romance and a little bit of sadness, or liked boys that are classified as the prince-type, loli-shota type, cool type, devil type or a natural rookie type, then you should watch this anime coz you'll really enjoy this movie and at the same time understand and appreciate the series as a whole. It's really great! ^_^",

Each person has their own specific traits, and without a doubt, their own problems they need to overcome. Everyone has their favorites too, so within a few episodes you'll be rooting for one person to get with the other, no doubt. \r\nCharacter development and the enjoyment level were the biggest pluses for Ouran. It keeps you entertained nearly the whole way through (except for one or two episodes around 19 or so).\r\nOnly weakness I found wasthe sound. I didn't particularly care for either the opening or the ending (though the opening wasn't all that bad I guess).\\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, it's almost impossible to not enjoy this show. The ending is great and the lead up to it is very well done. Want to feel good and laugh at the same time, check Ouran out.",

            "content": "There is a dif\u00adfer\u00adence between par\u00adody and what Ouran is doing. Par\u00adody sug\u00adgests you are mock\u00ading some\u00adthing, usu\u00adally in a satir\u00adical man\u00adner. Play\u00adful par\u00adody is no dif\u00adfer\u00adent. You are still mak\u00ading fun of the very thing you are par\u00adody\u00ading but say\u00ading it in such a way that sug\u00adgests you love these faults any\u00adway. This is not what Ouran does. Ouran goes through the pro\u00adcess of abso\u00adlute blatant fan-pandering and the humour is based around the fact that they are point\u00ading out that they are per\u00adform\u00ading this fan-pandering. Point\u00ading out what you are doing is not funny! It\u2019s not par\u00adody either, it\u2019s still just a con\u00adstantexer\u00adcise in fan-pandering. I am now writ\u00ading a sen\u00adtence which I\u2019m using as an example as to how point\u00ading out what I\u2019m doing isn\u2019t funny. You\u2019re not laugh\u00ading are you? Good, glad to see you guys have a proper sense of humour.\\n\\n\r\nThis was pretty much my reac\u00adtion through\u00adout the first 10 epis\u00adodes of the show. How\u00adever I was intent on enjoy\u00ading this anime. Every\u00adone else seems to love it, what the hell am I miss\u00ading? Am I really still pre\u00adju\u00addice against an anime because it\u2019s try\u00ading to appeal to women? One method I tried using to change my atti\u00adtude towards the show was the glor\u00adies of flirt\u00ading. I love proper flir\u00adta\u00adtious char\u00adac\u00adters like C.C, Horo and Sen\u00adjoga\u00adhara instead of the typ\u00adical moe girl who\u2019s reacts to any pos\u00adsib\u00adil\u00adity of flirt\u00ading by blush\u00ading and hid\u00ading her eyes under her fringe. When you think about it, Tamaki is the ulti\u00admate flirt\u00ading machine. If you solid\u00adi\u00adfied fab\u00adulous\u00adness and gave it life, you would get Tamaki. That method didn\u2019t work though and I\u2019m not sure why. Maybe because his flirt\u00ading was all fake?\\n\\n\r\nI tried a bunch of dif\u00adfer\u00adent meth\u00adods to try change my atti\u00adtude towards the show, each end\u00ading with a  total fail\u00adure to enjoy the show. (Incid\u00adent\u00adally there were two epis\u00adodes in a row that impressed and I thought I\u2019d stumbled across a mind\u00adset from which to enjoy the show, but the crap epis\u00adode returned instantly. Look\u00ading back, the reason was because the two epis\u00adodes focused on the class issue instead of the pretty boys). Even\u00adtu\u00adally I tried the mind\u00adset of gender\u00adswap\u00adping. If this was an anime about one poor loser guy find\u00ading a club of beau\u00adti\u00adful women who nearly all fall for him, would my atti\u00adtude towards the show be any dif\u00adfer\u00adent. Well, yes it would. I would have had a far easier time dis\u00admiss\u00ading the show as crap instead of spend\u00ading end\u00adless amounts of time wor\u00adry\u00ading that I wasn\u2019t approach\u00ading the show with the right mindset.\\n\\n\r\nPlease don\u2019t go telling me this is a par\u00adody. The way Haruhi enters the aban\u00addoned music room the Host Club screams wish ful\u00adfill\u00adment. You too could find a room full of beau\u00adti\u00adful men, all of whom are in love with each other as much as they are in love with them\u00adselves, and hav\u00ading them attend to you. I didn\u2019t watch this all to the end. I gave up after the epis\u00adode where Honey hurt his tooth. The epis\u00adode was set up entirely so they could have homo\u00aderotic scenes between Honey and that big bloke who never talks. They even go so far as to call it pure and utter moe in the show itself. By that stage I had seen enough\\n",

            "content": "Title: Ouran High School Host Club\r\nManga, Anime: Ouran High School Host Club was originally a manga created by Bisco Hatori that began running in Hakusensha's LaLa magazine on August 5th, 2003, and is still ongoing.  It has been licensed Stateside by Viz Media, and the releases are up to the 10th volume Stateside as of February 5th, 2008, while it currently stands at 12 collected volumes in Japan.  \r\nOuran High School Host Club is a twenty-six episode series that was produced by Studio Bones (famous for their work on Darker than BLACK and Fullmetal Alchemist) and directed by Takuya Igarashi (famous for hiswork on random episodes of Sailor Moon and Darker than Black).  It ran on Japanese television from April 4th to September 26th, 2006.  It has been licensed Stateside by Funimation, though it has yet to actually give a release date.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Haruhi Fujioka is a scholarship student attending the ultra-wealthy Ouran Academy, so poor that she can't even afford the uniform.  One day, as she's trying to find a quiet place to study, she comes across the Third Music Room and the Ouran High School Host Club (if you don't know what a host club is, it's basically a bunch of guys flirting with women for profit).  As she's trying to leave, she breaks a vase worth about $80,000, and is soon employed doing menial tasks to pay off her debt.  Unfortunately, her short hair cut, outfit, and large glasses make her look like a guy, and they soon promote her to host after they figure out she has a lot of potential.  She's a big hit, and even after they finally figure out that she's a girl, they have her stay on and conceal her gender, as she's such a hit, and she can repay her debt faster that way.  Most of the series focuses on the customers and the members of the Host Club.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, if it weren't for the fact that this were a screwball romantic comedy, this would be a fairly standard customer/problem of the week series.  However, it's because the series does not hesitate to turn its fairly sarcastic sense of humor back on itself that it succeeds so well.  Ouran openly makes fun of several genre tropes of shoujo, and by openly having characters point them out, and breaking the fourth wall while they're at it, manages to create amazing moments of meta (self-referential moments, for those of you not famliar with fandom terms).  It also has several good running gags that manage not to get old.\\n\\n\r\nAdd to this the fact that every character in the Club gets some kind of development and background (though I do have issue with where this falls, but see Length for more about that), as do minor recurring characters, and you've got a fairly solid show.  It's not anything that's ZOMG SPEKTAKULAR, but it's still a pretty good show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I really like how Bones did this series.  The lines that are used in the show are a bit thicker than the lines in most anime, which just makes the characters stand out that much more, and are especially effective when they use SD for humor moments.  You can barely tell when CG's used, and the 2D animation itself is very fluid.  The colors in general are very vibrant, and I actually found myself wondering how they got some of the exact colors that they did (especially Eclair's eyes), because they were absolutely beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, a fact that particularly endears this series to my heart is that they had the guy who did the series composition and scripts for Revolutionary Girl Utena doing the same for this (Yoji Enokido), which means that we got a lot of Utena-esque imagery, in how there's lots and lots of symbolism using mundane objects.  (The only reason I really noticed this was because I'm watching Utena with my school's anime club at the moment, and I saw a lot of similarities.)\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The background music for this series is extremely exaggerated and over the top, which isn't that much different from how the entire series is.  I don't know how it would stand on its own, but in context with the scenes that it's used in, it's a perfect combination.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and the ED are a special case.  They're the stereotypical female JPop upbeat number and a rousing rock number, respectively, and, in any other series, would not impress me that much.  They do here, though.  And I don't know WHY.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: Maaya Sakamoto (famous for her roles as Aeris Gainsborough in FFVII: Advent Children and Hitomi in Escaflowne) plays Haurhi, and Takehito Koyasu (famous for his roles as Touga in Revolutionary Girl Utena and Hotohori in Fushigi Yuugi) makes an appearance here and there as her father.  Otherwise, all the seiyuu managed to capture their characters' qualities perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nLength: The only problem I have with this series is where they placed background information and character development.  The former came after the latter, and, overall, it probably would have made a lot more sense to reverse the order, and maybe place it more towards the earlier end of the series more than the latter half.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, though, twenty-six episodes was a solid decision.  I think they could've trimmed a few episodes off, but overall, the length was pretty solid.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A screwball romantic comedy that's not afraid to have moments of meta and make fun of itself and its tropes, with excellent seiyuu, art and imagery, and music that fits the moments perfectly.  Could have lost a few episodes and rearranged the order a bit, but hey, it's still pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 9/10\\n\r\nLength: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 43/50; 86% (B )",

That means I'm MALE, and that this show's target demographic does not include me.  I am well aware of this fact, and all the more baffled because of it.\r\nI'm going to skip over the \"humor\" and the characters and the plot and everything else and go straight for the one thing that made me hate this anime: Ouran is quite possibly the most sexist anime I've everseen.  It discriminates and bashes on women more than any other show I've ever seen, including those stupid slave/maid hentai shows.\\n\\n\r\nOne scene in particular illustrates this very well:\\n\r\nHaruhi sees some of the Host Club's clients getting bullied by a couple of men, and she stands up to the bullies.  The rest of the Host Club rush to her aid, protect her, and then scold her for taking things into her own hands.  If that weren't enough, the show villainizes Haruhi afterwards, making it seem as if she did something wrong.  She is forced to (rather, guilt-tripped into) apologize for acting \"rashly\" (aka \"doing something\").\\n\\n\r\nWhy does this happen?\\n\\n\r\nOh right, because Haruhi is a woman.  And women are supposed to do nothing but sit around all day at the top of castles and wait for their knights in shining armor to rescue them.  Yeah.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the VICTORIAN AGE, people.  This is the 21st century.  Here, we have women screaming their lungs off about women's rights.  There's women's suffrage.  Women have been working their asses off for this past century to establish themselves in Americ-\\n\\n\r\nOH, THAT'S RIGHT.  This was made in JAPAN, the land of the Office Lady and tentacle porno, where women are treated like dirt and paid accordingly.  Apparently, animation companies think they like being treated like dirt.  And with the insane popularity of this series, you'd think women actually feel that way.",

            "content": "I would recommend this show even if you aren't a fan of the romantic comedy genre. It is an incredibly fun show. Even if you aren't super keen on reverse harem this show doesn't take itself seriously enough for that to be a major issue. There is of course a fair bit of romance for those of you who are looking for that but for me this was a show that was more comedy than romance. It has a really nice mix of silliness with a touch of sweet.\r\nThis isn't a show that will blow your mind with art. I found the style a littledated, but for me that is never really a problem, the poster should give you a good sense of whether it is a problem for you. It is typical shoujo style really, big eyes, lithe framed men. Similarly the music is pretty standard and unremarkable. \\n\\n\r\nThe story I found to be enjoyable. It's more situational with episodes revolving around their daily antics, until towards the end where things build nicely to what I found to be quite an amusing ending.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is not really a story driven show. It's a show you watch for the crazy situations, the overblown stereotypes and the ridiculous factor particularly of the male lead. Just on him, he confused me at first because they claimed he was the \"prince\" type. For those of you unfamiliar with the term it basically describes that perfect guy who is good at everything, has a slim build, super popular and a bit of a charmer. But I found him in reality to be quite different. He is more of a parody of the ridiculousness of that ideal, and kind of an idiot, so in the beginning I didn't know what to make of him. As time goes on though I really came to enjoy him, he is actually really likable and I like a leading man who you can laugh at. To me that is what makes Ouran Highschool Host Club stand out; the way that it laughs at itself.\\n\\n\r\nSo bottom line? If you like shoujo romcoms or reverse harem this is a must see! If you don't but you think you are open to watching one this would be the one to watch. If you can't stand shows about highschool and romance then I wouldn't watch it but trust me you are missing out!",

            "content": "I really enjoyed this anime.  More so than a lot of of other stories, it was witty and clever and just that amusing.  It's one of those animes where *everything* is pointed in the same direction; it's cohesive and put together like a Swiss watch.\r\nOn an each-episode basis, the story may not be so great... it's a little erratic.  Some episodes are better than others and I definitely have my favorites and have ones I'll probably always skip over.  But the whole arc of the story from first episode to last?  Terrific!  And the good parts are so goodthat it's easy to tolerate the less-good. ;)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, despite their flaws, are endearing and incredibly charming (well, with the exception of a few).  You start out with these cutout sterotypes and during the course of the season, each one of them becomes more and more three dimensional.; it's almost like getting to know a person.  You get past their &quot;type&quot; and into who they are and why and how and their individual strengths and weaknesses... it says a lot about judging a book by its cover.  And that sort of thing sounds like it would be trite and cheesy, I know.  The amazing thing is that it isn't... or even when it is, it's still so charming that it's nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and music are lavish and rich and perfect for the tone of the show.  Sometimes their faces aren't so detailed or distinguishable, but I think it goes hand in hand with the basic premise that there's more going on than just how they look.  Their wealth, which plays a huge part in Haruhi's (the leading female role) interaction with the host club, is almost like another member of the cast -- marble molding, the reflection of a room on the face of the clock, the immense sprawl of the campus, the rooms, of everything.  I like the bubbly, perky opening and I think it fits the playful tone of the story very, very well.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if you can tell, but I ***love*** this show.  I love it when Tamaki's naivete (and I always giggle when he sulks in the corner); I love the nurturing/suffocating bond of the twins; and I love how unflappable and &quot;normal&quot; Haruhi is.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing is... I don't really know what it means to &quot;grow mushrooms in someone else's storage room&quot;?  Any hints? =)",

            "content": "As a heterosexual male, I am not into girly anime, so when my girlfriend insisted I watched a reverse harem, I instantly thought this will be a soppy, chick flic anime about who know's what. After watching this anime, I now know how completely and utterly wrong I was. Instead of a perverted anime about 5 guys trying into get in some girl's pants, it is a comedy filled anime that isn't centered around the romance aspect of it.\r\nStory: 9.34/10 *Review\r\nHaruhi Fujioka is a tomboyish, poor female student who enters Ouran Highschool that is populated excessively by the wealthy (besides her). Upon entering the highscool,she tries finding a quite place to study, and enters the Music Room at the school, to her surprise finds the Ouran Highschool Host Club. After showing disinterest, and as she was about to leave, Haruhi breaks the host club's precious vase, and to pay back, she must work for them as a member of the Host Coub. *The story is original, and is actually appealing to not only girls, but to anyone looking for a good laugh. It mad me laugh along with the characters, and I even started shipping character's together (I hope no one finds out I watched this). This anime pacing was great, and the quality of it was better then a few of my favorites. Overall I give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art was high quality, the scenery detailed, and the the characters were animated beautifully. All the boys were attractive (I'm straight), and so where the woman. The animation had higher quality than most *cough* Soul Eater *cough*. I give it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.56/10 \\n\r\nThe voice acting was fluent and the voices fit the character's personalities very well. I watched this in dubbed and subbed, and I was supprised to hear Vic Morgonoan play Tamaki Suo in the dubbed. He played this part very well and i give him an A+. The opening theme song \"Sakura Kiss\" was catchy and modern, while the ending didn't seem to fit that well. Overall I give a very high 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8.23/10\\n\r\nThe characters design and personalities are refreshing, and the overall appeal of all the Host Club was great. Haruhie wasn't an annoying D.I.D (damsel in distress), the twins were hilarious (though it made me uncomraftable to watch them do the twincest thing), and Tamaki was annoying. But it was your good annoying, because that's his personality and it definitely shown through (lol). The characters were organized very well and it did have lots of character devolpment. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.41/10 (Oustanding)\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime, and all of it was great to watch. One thing that bothered me was the parts about \"Harhuie in Wonderland\" I'm not sure what that was about, but it was diffrent. It reminded me of \"Ciel in Wonderland\" from Black Butler. Not sure who copied who there. But overall this anime is entertaining and extremely fun to watch. I liked the comedy involved and how it doesn't completely focus on the romance of two characters. Finally a show not about 2 characters getting it on! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.75/10 (Oustanding)\\n\r\nAfter getting over my myself, and sucking up to watch this anime, I am glad I did. Art, characters, sound and story, are good. My girlfriend is glad I enjoyed it, and I get to pick the anime (SAO FTW). While this was out of my comfort zone, I'm glad I watched it and I hope you enjoy it as well.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR : Watched a reverse harem and liked it, got brownie points from gf.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I had heard about Ouran High School Host Club, I'm guess around last summer. A friend of mine was rabid about it, however, for some reason or another, I didn't read the manga... Later that summer my other friend also went rabid for it, and again I ignored it.... It wasn't until I read Kanashimi's review for it when I decided to watch the seemingly popular show.\rThe story is basically about a student by the name of Haruhi Fujioka who gets into a prestigious school for rich kids, and how she stumbles in on the school's \"Host Club\" and ends up having to become ahost (and cross-dress) to repay the club for breaking the vase. After this the anime's story line follows the activities of the club and it's members.\\n\\n\rStory -\\n\\n\rI can't really think of any really good words for Ouran's story. However, I found that the first episode had managed to suck me in and I was watching it like a rabid crazy person, just to see what would happen to the characters. Some of the episodes, especially episodes six and thirteen, seemed rather... unimportant, and while I did enjoy them I was ready to go on to the next episode. Also, I found myself slightly unsatisfied with the end, after all when you end something you like a lot, you're going to want more of it right? \\n\\n\rScore: 8\\n\\n\rAnimation -\\n\\n\rOuran High School Host Club has got some nice animation, and while it's rare for me to say that any anime has bad animation, I have to say Ouran's was... okay, you get what I mean. During the first episode when Haruhi was changing, and I saw her reflection in the background, for some reason I was amazed, maybe it was because it was there, or something else, however, it was... yeah. The animation also seemed akin to that of Fruits Basket, I'm sure I'm not the only one who has noticed this, however, at times because of this, my mind referred Hunny to Momiji...\\n\\n\rScore: 9\\n\\n\rSound - \\n\\n\rI liked the background music... I'm not entirely sure why, but I found it very fitting to the show... The opening theme, \"Sakura Kiss\" is pretty catchy, and while I do like the song, after episode seven or so, I started to skip listening to it, as for the ending song, I can't say that I know what it's called, seeing as the only times I have even bothered to listen to it were when the song was present during the episodes, but it's not really because I don't like it, it's just a habit.\\n\\n\rThe voice acting... Woah.. What can I say? Since Ouran hasn't been dubbed yet (and why not? Someone please licsense it?), I had to watch it subbed, which is not really something I like to do, however, I really like the Japanese voice acting for Ouran. Haruhi sounded convincingly like a young boy, and all the other voices suited their characters well. \\n\\n\rScore: 9\\n\\n\\n\rCharacters - \\n\\n\rAh. The characters... Well, I found all the main characters likable, and they all managed to leave very distinct impressions of who they were in my mind. Their actions, Tamaki especially, are very fun to watch, and some of them are very easy to picture in my mind, while I know that I haven't gotten them all covered... It is hard to tell if certain characters actually grow and change a bit, which is why I wish it was longer, however, I suppose that it's more realistic that way, since people don't change that fast.\\n\\n\rScore:  10\\n\\n\\n\rOverall -\\n\\n\rI really liked Ouran High School Host Club a lot, so much that it was able to tie itself with my previous number one title, Black Cat, and that I started to look for the manga. I do wish that the series was longer, so I could enjoy the host club more, however it'll be a miracle if there is another season. And if you're wondering, if this does get liscensed soon, and I hope it does, I will be buying it.. Though that fact is a bit irrelevant.\\n\\n\\n\rYay!: The characters are amazing! Diverse and... amazing. Renge, who I didn't like in the beginning also started to grow on me.\\n\\n\rNay~: Well, I'd say the plot suffered the most, seeing as I wanted more, and well... yeah. It needed more of the host club, and not the one act characters.\\n\\n\rScore: 9 kitties outta 10.",

            "content": "If I had to describe it in one word, it&rsquo;ll be this word : PERFECT. \r\nI had no qualms about it at all. Even Renge became acceptable at the end. I just love the plot, the cute topics per episode. It was done so beautifully. I have to say, whoever made Ouran knew me well. Back then I didn&rsquo;t know there was fan service for girls because I&rsquo;ve never witnessed it before. Now I know there is such a thing! I just love it when the guys go topless! \r\nEvery episode was so great. Every topic was charming and funny, which is what I loveabout it. My favorite episodes were Hikaru and Haruhi&rsquo;s date. That episode made me squeal so much, but then again, I squeal at almost every episode. Like I said, the creators know me too well. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot was so cleverly crafted. It was so simple and yet it had so much depth. Here we have a girl who was made to act and live like a guy, and she didn&rsquo;t even see it coming &ndash; the same goes for the rest of the host club too. They didn&rsquo;t know a girl like Haruhi would come into their lives (Aren&rsquo;t all Haruhis just great?), and affect them by their interactions with her. Boy, do I wish to be like Haruhi. She inspires me too &ndash; I also dream of being a lawyer someday, that&rsquo;s why I admire her so much. Another thing that I would like to add is that if Haruhi was a guy, I&rsquo;d definitely go after him. I would always forget that Haruhi&rsquo;s a girl sometimes (seems like it was that way for her too).\\n\\n\r\nI love the other characters too. I&rsquo;ve already mentioned I like Haruhi, but I like everyone else as well (except maybe that stupid &Eacute;clair girl). At first I thought Tamaki was the main man of this show who&rsquo;ll be charming and showy all the time, which would probably make me hate him. Thank God I was wrong, he turned out to be one of the funniest guys in the club and the-go to guy when it comes to comic relief. I love the twins too, I would cheer Hikaru on whenever he wants to make a move on Haruhi, but at the same time I sympathized for Kaoru since he is having a hard time because of all the anxiety in losing his brother, and his &ldquo;jealousy&rdquo; as well since obviously, he likes Haruhi too. Hunny was adorable too &ndash; I&rsquo;m not really into shotacon, but he&rsquo;s cute and funny nonetheless. Mori had the least number of lines, but boy is he handsome. Finally, my favorite out of the bunch, ah yes, the cool type &ndash; Kyoya. He is one sexy God, and I love how underhanded he is. \\n\\n\r\nI even liked some of the supporting characters Haruhi&rsquo;s dad was just awesome and well, pretty. Arai-kun, Haruhi&rsquo;s friend from middle school, was charming as well. Bossa Nova &ndash; kun was kinda funny too. The episode where he was first introduced was one of my favorites, and Nekozawa &ndash; senpai is cool as well. Who knew that underneath the cape he too is a bishonen, just as handsome as Tamaki can be. There are also the lobelia girls, which reminded me of MariMite. I don&rsquo;t really like them, but since they reminded me of one of my favorite series they&rsquo;re acceptable. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the other stuff. Drawing style was simple, but nice nonetheless. At first I thought it was CLAMP\\'s work since Tamaki kinda looked like Fye from TRC, and there was also the tall and stringy look of the characters (plus, there were a lot of bishonens too). It was perfect the way it is, and I think that a more complicated drawing style would overshadow the storyline. The colors were a bit solid and cutesy, but it fit the series wonderfully. I don&rsquo;t think shading and varying colors would&rsquo;ve been suitable. I&rsquo;m just glad the colors didn&rsquo;t clash. I love the details too. I&rsquo;m very critical and observant when it comes to details. I couldn&rsquo;t ignore the wonderful wall and ceiling designs. There were also the shojo frames and flowers that were intricate in design. I think they used a bit of CG on the beautiful chandeliers, but I&rsquo;m not sure about that. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was another part I liked about it. I&rsquo;ve been into Chieko Kawabe ever since I watched Elfen Lied, so having her on the soundtrack was a plus. Sakura Kiss will definitely be one of my anime song favorites forever. The ending song was also pretty good. I didn&rsquo;t like it at first, probably because I&rsquo;m too busy reflecting about what just happened in a certain episode but after a few episodes it grew on me. I didn&rsquo;t really have time to notice the BGM &ndash; I did at first (I wrote down on my notebook that it was good, so I guess it was good) but after awhile I channeled all my attention to the story. Which rocked, by the way &ndash; can&rsquo;t say that enough. I do vaguely remember a couple of classical music inserts throughout the series, specifically heard when Tamaki plays the piano or during their socials. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was also wonderful. The seiyus matched their characters perfectly, specially the twins&rsquo; seiyus. They added color to the twins&rsquo; antics. Oh yeah, Maaya Sakamoto&rsquo;s definitely my favorite seiyu now. She did such a good job on portraying Haruhi. Kudos to that as well. I did feel sorry for Mori&rsquo;s seiyu, whoever he is. I know he only said &ldquo;ah&rdquo; most of the time, but I still hope he was paid well. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe the fandom affected me too &ndash; people who barely watch anime talk about it, so I was wondering what was good about it. Finally I got to see for myself, and I really am hooked I&rsquo;m always smiling from ear to ear whenever I&rsquo;m watching it, and I stay that way until after I watch it.. Seriously, this series warms my heart. It&rsquo;s an automatic pick-me-up for me, that&rsquo;s why I love it so much. If I had to pick one series I will watch for the rest of my life, it would be this one, and I might even take it to the other world. FYI, I haven&rsquo;t got enough of it yet. I&rsquo;ll be watching it over and over until I get tired of it ( and that is highly unlikely.)",

            "content": "On the technical side of things, the animation in Ouran is top-tier for shoujo. Like its characters, this series is spoiled rotten with Studio Bones great animation staff, getting both the pretty design work of shoujo that we expect and fluid A-list animation that we don\u2019t. Every inch of the Barbie Kremlin is immaculately detailed, and the character designs are very\u2026appealing. (SQUEE! ^_^) \r\nThe music in Ouran is all waltzes, ballads and sweeping orchestral pieces, and all that beautiful, dramatic music is used not with reverence, but for satire, and it makes everything so much funnier than in the standard comedy with cartoon jingles. Italso helps to keep the mood uniform when some minor drama surfaces and that same music CAN be used seriously\u2026but just for a second. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voicework, I don\u2019t know Japanese, but I\u2019ve heard a lot of comedies in the language, and Ouran has one of the funniest casts of seiyuu in a romantic comedy. It is mind-blowingly funny if you can keep up with it, but even if you can\u2019t, you should at least give the awesome Japanese track a listen at some point. To give your eyes a rest, there\u2019s the dub, which as you may expect, has a LOT to live up to now. I\u2019m not sure they could ever be better than the subbed result. But I am happy to say that they may be just as good, and probably deserve a medal just for pronouncing all the dozens of Japanese words in the show perfectly. Caitlin Glass sounds perfectly tomboyish with just a hint of femininity that has all those hosts in such a hot tizzy, the twins have fairly different voices that make a harmonious blend put together, Kyoya\u2019s delivery is just as sexily serpentine as it should be, and Hunny is sticky sweet syrupy cuteness on a bun-bun, and then there\u2019s Tamaki, the hardest part of them all to play. Now yes, he plays the part a little different from the brilliant Mamoru Miyano, but well, consider the age difference: he\u2019d have to. Still, Vic Mignogna completely works the part in every direction and is absolutely hilarious. Did I forget someone? No, I guess not. (You see, Mori has about four lines in the whole show...)\\n\\n\r\nSo I spent a lot of time elaborating on this show\u2019s fine pedigree because really, that\u2019s most of the appeal. It\u2019s just a filthy-rich, la vida loca slumber-party show and it looks like that party has hung a sign on the door that says \u201cNo Boys Allowed.\u201d But let me get serious for a moment and talk about the humor. It can be smart satire, stupid slapstick, or both at the same time, but whatever the case, this is one of the funniest anime I have ever seen, period, and the humor is broad in appeal. \\n\\n\r\nThis show makes fun of anime stereotypes, rich people, moe-crazed fangirls, high school angst, gender differences, just every nerdy and teen-centric topic imaginable and then just settles down for some a good old game of hit the funny French person. Throughout it all, the fourth wall is hardly ever standing. I think if Tex Avery and Chuck Jones had written Saved By the Bell, this would have exploded into being. So on the note of male appeal, I do know some guys who can\u2019t get over the repulsive level of manservice in Ouran, but I also know several guys who move past that and think it\u2019s just as funny as all the girls do. You may just have to test the waters, gentlemen. You are venturing into the wild unknown, but it may well be worth the dip!\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, that still doesn\u2019t make this show anymore than a really good-looking gigglefest, so Ouran decides to completely risk its enjoyment factor in the greatest mistake of all anime comedies: trying to be dramatic. I mean, how in the world is this stupid harem crossdresscapade ever supposed to be taken seriously?\\n\\n\r\nIt works, though.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t ask me how, but every once in a while, this show starts reaching for your heartstrings, and it almost always works. It may steer too close to corny once or twice, but most of the time it\u2019s incredibly heartwarming, and I think this is 100% due to the likability of the cast. Everyone that watches this show ends up with a favorite host, but there\u2019s not one of the cast that isn\u2019t fun to watch or ever wears out their welcome. Well, except Renge, but she\u2019s an otaku, and we all know how annoying those freaks are. (wink wink, nudge, nudge)\\n\\n\r\nStill, it really feels like the way I wish my high school had been, complete with belly laughs, happy sighs, and sexy guys. Don\u2019t hate \u2018em cause they\u2019re beautiful, just put the fun back in dysfunctional and you will feel no pain as they drive you insane.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Ouran is an always-inviting self-parody with just as much heart as glitz, glam, and girly guys. It ranges from smart to stupid all at the same time, is drop-dead hilarious no matter your gender, but of course offers just a little more for the ladies, and does it all with style.\\n\\n\r\n*THIS IS A PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF MY VIDEO REVIEW WHICH CAN BE SEEN HERE:\\n\\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJNbm4H1OrI\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Charming, comedic, and thoroughly enjoyable.  These three phrases are the perfect descriptors of Ouran High School Host Club, a \"romantic\" (but it's not really romance), \"high school\" (if your high school was also attended by the children of multi-millionaires) comedy that simultaneously pokes fun of at the types of anime that it spawns from as well as crafting an elegant story that stems from that very genre.\r\nOuran's characterization is its strong-point: each individual is an exaggeration of an anime template, taken to its very (il)logical extreme.  You have your lovable caretaker, your brooding mastermind, your \"loli shota-type\", a stoic guardian, and a pairof twins, lost in each other's world.  Thrown into this multidimensional cast of characters if Fujioka Haruhi, an independent spirit, who doesn't fit in with the throngs of rich kids (not that she cares to), due to her &quot;commoner&quot; origins.  Together, they are the &quot;Host Club&quot;, paying hired attention to the captivated ladies who have entirely too much time and money that fill the ranks of the Ouran Academy.  As the series progresses, you discover the backgrounds behind each of the main characters, and how they came to be what they are today.  In addition, you witness the numerous escapades of Suou Tamaki, leader of the Host Club, always guiding the hosts forward towards ever-increasing extravagance.\\n\\n\r\nThe brilliantly-crafted characters mesh together to create an image of the &quot;day-to-day&quot; activities of the students at the Ouran Academy.  While the primary setting of the story is a high school, almost no academic schooling of any type occurs throughout the series - the focus is squarely upon the activities of the Host Club.  Whether it be an excursion to some tourist location, an intrusion into Haruhi's &quot;common&quot; life, or a flashback into the pasts of one or more of the characters, the story never feels forced or artificial.  The course of events flow naturally, the flashbacks coincide with events in the present day that share a common lesson with the events preceding it.  And, above all else, the comedy is omnipresent and ludicrously fitting the moment, the crown example being Tamaki's Inner Mind Theater, which shows the twistedly exaggerated thoughts going through Tamaki's mind in reaction to something happening.\\n\\n\r\nThere are, however, a few negatives with respect to the story.  In particular, the plot seems to linger along during the middle part of the series, after the introductions of the individual characters are done, but before the series really gets started with their backgrounds and flashbacks.  These episodes could probably have been condensed, or somehow made to fit with the character backgrounds in order to supply more development time for the thrilling concluding arc of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective, Ouran also delivers.  The soundtrack is soothing when it needs to be, reminiscent when it needs to be, and powerful as well, when it needs to be.  Between the smooth melodic background piano to the rumbling guitar intro to the ending theme, Ouran's music certainly fits the mood.  The sound effects themselves are also natural and expected.  You will get used to the sound of flower petals blowing the breeze, as well as the lifting and setting down of countless tea cups.  Visually, the style in Ouran is unique, especially with its stylized facial expressions.  However, the art style does seem to be lacking at times, in that it occasionally fails to convey the full power of the emotions behind a scene.  In particular, while each of the individual facial expressions are well-done, there seems to be too few of them, at least too few to match the needs of the series at large.  However, this is but a small problem in the grand scheme of things, and should not deter anyone more watching this excellent series.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're tired of the ordinary, or just want to laugh endlessly at the oftentimes formulaic aspects of characterization and plot used in romance anime, pick up Ouran High School Host Club.  The hosts will be waiting for you.",

            "content": "Ouran Host Club mocks all your shoujo stereotypes while simultaneously utilizing those same stereotypes to create a wonderful series. I'd say that takes talent.\r\nSTORY - I avoided this series for a long time just because the premise didn't interest me, and from a distance, it seemed like one of those parodies that would err on the side of taking itself too seriously. I'm really glad I ended up giving it a chance though; Ouran High School Host Club manages to be hilarious from the get-go and is surprisingly adorable. It's perfect in portraying the handful of stereotypes that appear over and over again in shoujoand doesn't shy away from blatant self-references and mockery to make sure it doesn't take itself too seriously. And yet, the series somehow still manages to have a captivating &quot;serious&quot; side and great romance potential. \\n\\n\r\nI like to gripe a lot about anime adaptations of manga that aren't finished too, but Host Club has an excellent and concluded storyline (with huge potential for a sequel!) despite the still-running manga. Admittedly, I haven't read much of said manga yet, but from what I can tell, the anime follows it pretty damn precisely. Many of the episodes are very silly and episodic, and there's also the predictable handful of episodes dedicated to each character's backstory, but there's rarely a dull moment. It's entertaining and fun through and through.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - For a cast conceived entirely of over-used stereotypes, Host Club really does an amazing job in keeping everyone interesting, especially since it isn't afraid to point out those obvious type molds. There isn't really anything particular or unique about Haruhi, but that's exactly what makes her so easy to relate to. Her androgyny only furthers this by destroying that gender barrier, and honestly, I'd love to see more reverse traps in anime. Haruhi is great at balancing characteristics that are considered typical of both men and women, and she's also endearingly oblivious. Never underestimate the power of stupidly endearing characteristics... Tamaki is a fun character for all the same reasons.\\n\\n\r\nHe has tons of little quirks -- many of them are common, but that doesn't stop them from being effective when they're so well done. Everyone gets those obligatory background episodes that explore their personalities beyond the stereotype. It's a tricky thing to give a parody a personality; how do you give them depth without seeming pretentious or just like the cliches you're trying to mock? I'm really not sure, but somehow Host Club manages. The twins have a completely generic emo twin backstory, but I'm still compelled to sympathize with them and to empathize with their friendships with the rest of the club. Kyouya has a similarly generic sibling angst story, but I still like the bastard. Mori and Honey weren't as interesting to me personally, but I can still see where their appeal would be for others.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it isn't so much the originality of the characters that make them so good -- it's their interaction with each other. Everything feels natural. It's just entertaining to watch them go about their shenanigans and to hear them mock one another, their genre, otaku culture, and random other things. And the subtlety of their strong friendships is what ties the whole series together. As the episodes build on, it gets clearer and clearer just how important those friendships are. Yes, this is a satire and a comedy, but there's a good story about friendship buried under all that too. It's a simple and generic story, but it's a good story all the same.\\n\\n\r\nARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - I really love the style and animation used in the opening theme. It's clean and cute and pretty unique-looking. Hell, the opening in general is just adorable and fun to look at, and it's one of the few that I actually sat through and watched more than a half dozen times. The style in the series itself is pretty generic, but as most of the characters were designed to be generic, this really isn't too big a deal. Indeed, all the characters perfectly master the visual charm that made their stereotypes so widely popular to begin with. And at the same time, the designs somehow manage to also capture the personal quirks that each character still has -- the twins are typical badboys, but their emotion is still there; there are probably twenty billion characters that look exactly like Kyouya, but somehow, he still feels like his own person. It's interesting (maybe it's the uniform?).\\n\\n\r\nThere are also lots of nice backgrounds in Host Club. It's a very fancypants and elaborate academy after all. Sure, a lot of the wide exterior shots and some of the interiors are recycled a lot, but they're still intricate and pretty backdrops. The animation is pretty average. There's nothing particularly spectacular, but I don't really think there's really anything that needs to look spectacular. Funny thing about shoujo, there aren't usually too many fights that need to be animated super smoothly. XD\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - The opening theme, &quot;Sakura Kiss&quot; by Chieko Kawabe is a really cute song. It's upbeat and fun and just an all around fitting theme to the series in general. For the dub, the song is translated into English, and it works surprisingly well. The voice sounds exactly the same, and I really thought the singer just had two versions of the song at first. The translated lyrics work pretty nicely too. I didn't like the end theme as much as the opening, but that usually seems to be the case because they're just generally not as exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in the series is nicely varied. To emphasize the rich, upper class and noble environment, there are often classical instrumental themes; the moods are often exaggerated with very shrill, high-tension violins for the action and drama and soft, melancholic piano for the emotional and tragic scenes (cheerful, everyday scenes are usually accompanied by flutes and strings). It's good to note that even the music sticks with the over-the-top and satirical nature of many of the scenes. For more serious bits, the music follows suit and calms down to more traditional melodies, including several instrumental versions of the opening theme and the piano themes that Tamaki plays. As a fan of classical music, I tend to be drawn to soundtracks like this, but either way, I think everything suited Host Club very well.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - I saw the first half of the series dubbed (all that's currently available on DVD) and the rest subbed. It's been a while since I've seen a dub first, but Host Club's dub seriously impressed me. Vic Mignogna is the perfect Tamaki. He nails every line and every emotion, and it's just a very convincing performance overall. One of my biggest voice acting peeves is when actors don't change their voices between roles, which gets really annoying really fast in English dubs because there's such a limited talent pool. When Tamaki is acting flustered or funny!angry, he sounds a bit like Edward Elric, but for the most part, Mignogna manages to give the character a distinct voice, and I found that to be very impressive. Caitlin Glass as Haruhi was also pretty amazing, and I was again really happy to hear a distinct voice for the character. Honestly, the entire cast was excellent and all the voices were wonderfully suited to their roles (the only annoying voices were for the annoying characters!).\\n\\n\r\nIt seems that the English dub is aimed very much for an otaku crowd as well. A few honorifics are carried over without explicit explanation, particularly &quot;senpai&quot; and &quot;-chan,&quot; and the cute shortening of names before attaching the &quot;-chan&quot; (like Haru-chan or Hika-chan) is also kept. It was really weird hearing it at first, but all things considered, I think it turned out pretty well. It doesn't feel overly unnatural, and those little speech habits really keep characters like Honey and Haruhi truer to the original. (Now if only they could figure out a way to translate distinct first-person pronouns...) It's fitting since Host Club does so well to mock otaku culture, and it definitely added to the experience to hear such lulzy culture-generated terms like &quot;twincest.&quot; The translation felt very relevant and in-touch to the English-speaking otaku scene which was fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nThe original Japanese cast is pretty good too, but I don't think I like Mamoru Miyano as Tamaki as much as I like Vic Mignogna. While Mignogna only occasionally strays to Ed's voice, I often hear a host of other characters when I hear Miyano... of course, that might just be because I've heard more of Miyano's roles than Mignogna, but all the same. Maaya Sakamoto as Haruhi was better, and I found it hilarious that Haruhi's poor singing skills are emphasized when Sakamoto is such a lovely singer. I prefer the Hitachiin twins' Japanese voices to their English counterparts because they're easier to distinguish from one another, and that's one of the easiest ways I had to tell them apart. Since much of the rest of the cast is very stereotypical, their Japanese and English voices were about on the same level; the actors sounded typecasted, but that works just fine. Sometimes, I just get tired of reading subtitles, so while the original cast is good, I think Host Club's dub is one of the few I'd choose to watch over the sub if given the choice.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - I don't think I've ever wanted a sequel for a series as much as I do for this one. The ending is predictable but adorable and practically begs for a follow-up series -- how is it that Ouran High School Host Club mocks so much of what's common in shoujo, but somehow manages to use all the same formulas to make you love it? I suppose it's proof that even the most tired of cliches can be given new life if done right. There are no original ideas left, but there are still new, fun, and interesting ways to twist around what's around there. To all the skeptics, I highly recommend giving this series a shot. The first eight dub episodes are available streaming on FUNimation's website (the first three episodes are also available subbed). I was a skeptic too.",

            "content": "Story :9:  This anime is adapted from the manga series by Bisco Hatori and tells the story of a poor girl that was excepted in to a very rich high school.  She finds herself in debt for 8,000,000 yen and is forced to become the schools Host Club's dog until she pays it back.  The story is wonderfully rounded with mostly comedy and romance but it throws some drama in at the appropriate moments.  It kept me coming back for more and more and in the end it left me wanting.  I only gave it a nine because of somesmall missing people or story lines from the manga that I really enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nArt :10:  The art in Ouran is amazing.  Not necessarily the animation itself, but the storyboard was done beautifully.  It had a flavour all its own that sets it apart from the manga and from other animes in it's genre.  The use of the cut away scenes to express what the characters are feeling adds so much to the storyline by giving this wonderful &quot;oh I get it&quot; factor when the story is completely finished.  Definitely a 10!\\n\\n\r\nSound :10:  I am not really sure how I should rate the sound.  But I thought that the voice actors did a wonderful job and that the music was appropriate and at times really lovely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :10:  The one thing that I really enjoyed about this show was the character development.  The way you could follow the growth of the main characters and understand why they were who they were was just awesome.  The back stories were marvelously included in stages so you always knew what you needed to know about the people involved.  I was very surprised that I could learn so much about them in just 26 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :10:  If you haven't figured it out by now, I really enjoyed watching this show.  Not only the first time, but every time I have re watched it or showed it to friends, the enjoyment not only stays but adjust in an awesome way when you notice things you did not before.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :10:  This show as a whole definitely gets a 10 from me.  But don't just take my word for it, go, watch it now.",

Then look no further! Just read on!! :D\r\nStory 3/10: The story is honestly the worst plot I have ever heard, a girl goes to a rich school. Of course she has extremely short hair and looks like a man due to some 'gum incident'! Its overly predictable. There is too many of these stupid drama high school animes to begin with, though Ouran High School Host Club is by far the worst.This anime was supposed to have comedy in it, though not once did I find anything they said funny, what I find more pathetic is that they basically were begging you to laugh, saying the most stupid things. My response instead of laughing was actually 'why the hell am I still watching this?!' and many times I was seconds away from dropping the anime altogether.\\n\\n\r\nArt 2/10: The drawings are horrible. Over 90% of the anime I had no idea what was going on due to the lighting of the show. They made it too bright and I could barely tell what was going on, having to guess most of the time, as well as the horrible lighting it hurt my eyes in a few minutes, making me want to not even watch the rest of an episode. The background and environment was badly drawn as well, making it extremely unenjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10: They did a horrible job with the music choice. The music didn't flow nicely with the concept of the show. Although I'm not sure what could, since its such a horrible anime. The voices and recordings seems low and poor. I had to turn my speakers up very high to just barely hear what they were saying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10: The characters seemed to be forced to be a certin way thoughout the whole show, making it extremely distasteful. Honestly all the guys seemed like homosexuals to me, even if their personalities wern't acting like one. They all seemed cliche which was something I dislike very much. They all seemed like a joke to me and it was very diffacult for me to take any of them seriously, in the most serious of situations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10: It was honestly a pathetic show. I had not one ounce of enjoyment during any part of watching it. Me finishing it is even a miracle to myself and I often wonder how I got though such a horrible anime. The beginning even starts out horrible and I just continued watching hoping that it would get better, sadly it didn't. It was honestly a total waste of my time and if I could take make the time back I used to watch this anime I would in a heartbeat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 1/10: Overall, it was the worst and most pathetic excuse for an anime I have ever seen. I honestly don't consider it an anime, it seems more like a joke to me. Everything seemed to be written by a ten year old with some sort of issue. The story was horrible, the music was horrible, and the characters were a disgrace. Why people actually enjoy is anime is mystery to me. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you want to waste your time and be disappointed at the end then the pathetic excuse for the anime Ouran High School Host Club is the perfect show for you! Be expected to just be disappoined in the end, because it was a major disappointment to me. Of course I know that people will be offended by this review, but I'm just speaking the honest truth of this anime. Now that the truth is out, its you choice wether you want to waste your time or not.",

            "content": "Lets start off with the story. the story is about 16 year old haruhi she transfers to this ultra rich and very high esteemed school. she is accidentally mistaken for a boy, when she comes across the all boys host club of the school. she then ends up breaking a very expensive vase. she then is forced in to the club to pay the club back. but just as you think it could not get any funnier the guys of the club find out she is a girl and that is where their adventure begins. to me that is most original piece of high schoollife anime. \\n\\n\r\nthe art i found was amazing b/c it reminds a lot of tsubasa chronicles style and also along the lines of princess princess.\\n\\n\r\nthe sound to me was very good. i found extremely fun when you knew tamaki was upset or getting really annoyed. you could tell each character had their own unique sound or music played to them.\\n\\n\r\nthe characters in this were extremely funny and entertaining, but they also went through developing stages. first there is tamaki who is the president or dad as tamaki calls himself of the club, he also the founder of the club. it is so funny to see him get so obsessed over haruhi and how is wishes she would acknowledge his feelings. he is hilarious to watch, but he can also be serious and romantic. you see him develop into more of an adult.\\n\\n\r\nthen there is kyouya. he is the vice president a.k.a shadow king called by the club and mama as been called by tamaki. he seems to have a great bond with tamaki as a friend. he is very serious and seems to long to do his best at everything to impress his father. however thanks to tamaki and haruhi, that he soon discovers he does not need his father's acknowledgements to make him fulfilled. \\n\\n\r\nthere are also the twins kaoru and hikaru. they are identical and very hard to tell apart. though if you watch carefully you can. they use their twin inhibitions to get what they want to play jokes on people. they become very fond of haruhi and call her their toy. however only hikaru has deeper feelings for her. they are trouble makers but they learn to come out of just hanging only with each other and learn the deeper meaning of friendship.\\n\\n\r\nhoney and momo are cousins. they are excellent fighters. it may appear that honey does not have the emotion to fight but he can and will do whatever takes to protect his friends. he is loveable. loves to eat sweets, and hugs and holds his soft pink rabbit. momo is a tall dark and handsome. but he is very quiet and only seems to mutter to himself or talks to honey. he seems to like haruhi but only as a friend but there times in the show where you think his emotion to haruhi is not just being a friend.\\n\\n\r\nlast is haruhi. she does not seem to mind cross dressing but it bothers tamaki a great deal he is so jealous when others fawn over her. she is capable of opening the eyes of the host club and showing them a whole new side to themselves. its almost like what tamaki does in the club. however haruhi learns some important things from the club too. and she soon discovers an evern deeper feeling for one of the club members.\\n\\n\r\ni really enjoyed this show i laughed i cried i even squealed a couple times. if you are a huge anime fan you will love this.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an outstanding piece of work.",

            "content": "Sometimes you just feel down in the dumps, and nothing seems to interest you. Well, Ouran just might be the perfect antidote to your melancholy - I guarantee that 5 minutes into the first episode of this anime and you will be laughing your head off at the genius absurdity of this show.\r\nEither that, or you'll leave IMMEDIATELY due to its stupidity and complete idiocy. But hey, most people stay, so why wouldn't you?\r\nStory:\r\nMost people are tired of the typical, cheesy shojo series where \"boy meets girl, they fall in love and live happily ever after\". I know for one that I am SICK ofsuch series. Ouran gives a refreshing new plot, where for once the heroine is not a complete air-head, and in fact is the voice of reason in the show! *gasps* The premise of a host club is just so new and unique that it's like sticking colour in a black-and-white photograph\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI am a sucker for good art. Bones has officially become my favourite animation studio due to the great work they did with OHSHC. The manga art was ok, but the anime art was -almost- flawless. Although it was simple, as they say, &quot;simple is art&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes accompany all 26 episodes. I have to say that Sakura Kiss was the perfect tune to open up each episode of OHSHC. The opening music fitted each frame perfectly. Background music is not that memorable, while the ending theme, Shissou, is not to my taste, but is decent enough. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nHatori Bisco has created the most memorable set of characters. For one, as I have mentioned before, for once in the history of anime the heroine is NOT a complete air-head, and is the voice of reason in the story! Haruhi gets a 10/10 from me, along with Kyouya and Honey-sempai. Character-wise, Tamaki's personality is not the most original (the devilishly handsome baka); neither are Hikaru and Kaoru's, but they get 9.5/10 for character development. You can just see how much Hikaru changes over the course of the story, which is really quite...heartwarming, if I may. \\n\r\nFrom the exuberant Tamaki, to the calculating Kyouya, to the stoic Mori, there will be someone in the host club that appeals to your taste.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nOut of all the shows I've ever watched, OHSHC is probably the one show where I've laughed every single episode. Once, I even fell out of my chair laughing. Does that explain why I gave it a 10/10 for enjoyment?\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThis anime is probably one of the only ones I will ever rewatch. It's such a delightful romantic comedy. With a group of beautiful bishounen to boot, the Ouran High School Host Club is sure to sweep you off your feet. \\n\\n\r\nStep into the Third Music Room, into the world of Ouran High School. You'll not regret it. \\n\\n\r\nPS. I am pretty new to writing reviews, so if you found this review unhelpful, please PM me or leave a comment on my profile telling me why!",

            "content": "So, lets get one thing straight. You don't watch Ouran High school host club because you want to learn interesting things, feel great passion, think a whole lot about life, see beautiful art, hear beautiful music, follow a moving and morally sound story or to see deep and realistic characters that you can identify with... No, you watch it cause it's fun, and isn't that kind of what it's all about, anyway? \r\nNO SPOILERS\r\nOuran high school host club is unapologetically extravagant, intensely cliche, overly dramatic, a teensy bit ridiculous *cough* and all of it's characters are freaking stereotypes, but it's like: \"Yeah, so? Who cares?\"It's quite clean cut. It's an anime you don't have to think about, everything is basically exactly as it seems. If you don't like that, don't watch it. I personally found myself enjoying it a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters do not have that much depth, they are given some backstory after you've gotten used to them. It was cute, it was corny, it was nothing you haven't seen before. That's the charm of the thing, though. So many anime try to be interesting, just by having an sad backstory, a dark plot or complicated characters, but they completely miss something that I really need in an anime. Comfort. FUN. Ouran high school host club just makes me happy, it makes me laugh. I won't feel guilty if I forget the entire plot in a month. And if I don't even remember watching it a year from now, all the better, I can go watch it again.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to sit here picking it apart any further because it's just not that kind of anime. Something doesn't have to have a lasting impact to be great. So if you're looking for a nice, happy, funny, cute filler anime, please just go watch it. It won't be your all time favorite, but you'll probably have a good time.",

            "content": "Character(s) & Their Development\rEvery character is based with a sterotype near the beginning of the series. The real question though is if the characters actually grow out of their set roles. After watching the whole series that's both a yes and a no. It all comes down to the fact that the manga is still going and the characters are still maturing in that format; thus, they can only grow so far in the anime without making it a new story entirely. Sure, they stay towards their first impressions but, there are a handful of episodes that explain each Host Club member and their reasoningbehind attitude, outlook, and for joining the club in the first place.\\n\\n\rA keen example is Tamaki and his feelings for Haruhi. In the beginning, he takes on a father role towards her and the audience is made to believe that this is only part of his nature; however, the viewers should realize that this is because of the feelings he holds for her. Even Tamaki doesn't understand it and in episode twenty-three is forced to question it. He probably can't comprehend his feelings in the end, but he seems to establish some understanding towards Haruhi. Really, characters do grow but they tend to have done a lot of growing before the show was established, and quite a few past experiences are explained through-out the episodes. Either way, the audience is given the chance to fall in love with the characters before they begin to change, which adds a nice and smooth transition.\\n\\n\rAnimation\\n\rI've found people complain at the lack of the details made towards the characters themselves. Then again, how much detail do you want on a character that's about to turn chibi on your ass? Seriously, the animators did a wonderful job at finding a keen balance between common and glorious so that when a touching moment is needed, the characters have that necessary lovely animation & while during the hyper-active moments, the characters are bouncy and have a jelly-like movement.\\n\\n\rOne thing that caught my attention after reviewing certain episodes was how detailed the background could be. I hadn't noticed it on the first run through due to how into the show I was; however, if you pay attention, you really notice how wealthy the animators attempted to make the school look. Look at the ceilings and the inscriptions into it, that's pretty damn detailed to me.\\n\\n\rMusic\\n\rI was iffy about the music in the beginning. Once I heard the first line of the opening, Sakura Kiss, I felt the catchiness; however, after listening to the whole thing I wasn't direly impressed. The ending song, Shissou, I didn't like at all. It just sounded like normal Japanese rock. I was disappointed even more when I found LAST ALLIANCE was the band who preformed it because they could have done a lot better.\\n\\n\rRegardless, I gave the music a chance and got a copy of the available soundtracks. While watching the show I found the melody coordinated with many places perfectly, surely in the Ouran world the music full of rich violins, playful piano, and elegant harp was a match made in heaven. In it\u2019s own way everything works... but that ending song.\\n\\n\rDubbing/Subbing\\n\rSince there is no dubbing released, I can't comment on that; however, the subtitles by Lunar Anime provided on their fansub were wonderfully done. Generally, I don't like to comment on subtitles because what's there to say, but what I liked was how many notes were provided to get said joke. It was also produced very nicely for the English audience.\\n\\n\rOverall\\n\rSimply, Ouran High School Host Club is just a fun old time. It's got the wackiness to pull you into a fit of giggles, but at the same time enough character development to move along with a pretty random plot. I was going to skip this series entirely because I tend to avoid popular shows now-a-days; however, in the end I'm glad I didn't. This was certainly worth my time and I guarantee it's worth yours, too. It's hard to find a character or a part that you plainly didn't like. So, unless you're extremely nit-picky, then there shouldn't be a problem to enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\rThere are lots of laughs and pretty boys waiting for you at the Host Club so what are you reading this review for?",

            "content": "Ouran High School is one of the best reverse harem anime series I have watched. The first episode really made an impact. It did not start as to be draggy but rather it easily showed the main idea of the story which started when they have discovered that Haruhi is a girl. The story was quite shallow at first which was just showing the different themes of the club and how they entertained the guests but when you continue with the later part of the series, you'll realize that behind all the smiles of the characters, there is a bitter past. The flow of thestory is also good. It starts with the story of a certain character, followed by an episode just for enjoyment, them the story of a certain character and so on which promoted the balanced flow of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this anime is great since they can convene the different effects for a specific situation correctly. The type of animation used was the traditional type of animation (not the 3D or any modern form of animation) which for me, was better since the traditional type of animation was a type wherein the viewers can interpret more using their own imaginations.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song Sakura Kiss (which became my favorite) sung by Chieko Kawabe was really fitting for the series since it was lively and the lyrics can really relate to the main character which was Haruhi Fujioka. The ending song Shissou sung by Last Alliance was great in which it blended with the appeal of the club.\\n\\n\r\nI like the way they treat each other. They treat each other as close friends not some enemy that is to be competed financially or in other aspects (which was the opposite of what their parents really want). Each of the character's qualities complimented the others that's why their host club was in harmony. Other characters are also shown who were either supporting or testing the  strength of the bond between the host club members.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching this anime, I might have looked like i was crazy or something coz i kept on laughing out loud everytime there is something really really funny like the thing that happened during their host club ball and the ever-changing characteristic of Tamaki Suou. The &quot;punch lines&quot; and &quot;Labels&quot; also help a lot in expressing the humor of the series like in the part of Kyouya who just recently woke up from bed was placed title as a &quot;Low Blood Pressure Evil Lord&quot; and Haruhi was labeled &quot;Studious Commoner&quot; and the host club's &quot;DOG&quot; at the very start of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a lot of laughs mixed with a mixture of romance and a little bit of sadness, or liked boys that are classified as the prince-type, loli-shota type, cool type, devil type or a natural rookie type, then you should watch this anime coz you'll really enjoy this movie and at the same time understand and appreciate the series as a whole. It's really great! ^_^",

It keeps you entertained nearly the whole way through (except for one or two episodes around 19 or so).\r\nOnly weakness I found wasthe sound. I didn't particularly care for either the opening or the ending (though the opening wasn't all that bad I guess).\\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, it's almost impossible to not enjoy this show.

            "content": "There is a dif\u00adfer\u00adence between par\u00adody and what Ouran is doing. Par\u00adody sug\u00adgests you are mock\u00ading some\u00adthing, usu\u00adally in a satir\u00adical man\u00adner. Play\u00adful par\u00adody is no dif\u00adfer\u00adent. You are still mak\u00ading fun of the very thing you are par\u00adody\u00ading but say\u00ading it in such a way that sug\u00adgests you love these faults any\u00adway. This is not what Ouran does. Ouran goes through the pro\u00adcess of abso\u00adlute blatant fan-pandering and the humour is based around the fact that they are point\u00ading out that they are per\u00adform\u00ading this fan-pandering. Point\u00ading out what you are doing is not funny! It\u2019s not par\u00adody either, it\u2019s still just a con\u00adstantexer\u00adcise in fan-pandering. I am now writ\u00ading a sen\u00adtence which I\u2019m using as an example as to how point\u00ading out what I\u2019m doing isn\u2019t funny. You\u2019re not laugh\u00ading are you? Good, glad to see you guys have a proper sense of humour.\\n\\n\r\nThis was pretty much my reac\u00adtion through\u00adout the first 10 epis\u00adodes of the show. How\u00adever I was intent on enjoy\u00ading this anime. Every\u00adone else seems to love it, what the hell am I miss\u00ading? Am I really still pre\u00adju\u00addice against an anime because it\u2019s try\u00ading to appeal to women? One method I tried using to change my atti\u00adtude towards the show was the glor\u00adies of flirt\u00ading. I love proper flir\u00adta\u00adtious char\u00adac\u00adters like C.C, Horo and Sen\u00adjoga\u00adhara instead of the typ\u00adical moe girl who\u2019s reacts to any pos\u00adsib\u00adil\u00adity of flirt\u00ading by blush\u00ading and hid\u00ading her eyes under her fringe. When you think about it, Tamaki is the ulti\u00admate flirt\u00ading machine. If you solid\u00adi\u00adfied fab\u00adulous\u00adness and gave it life, you would get Tamaki. That method didn\u2019t work though and I\u2019m not sure why. Maybe because his flirt\u00ading was all fake?\\n\\n\r\nI tried a bunch of dif\u00adfer\u00adent meth\u00adods to try change my atti\u00adtude towards the show, each end\u00ading with a  total fail\u00adure to enjoy the show. (Incid\u00adent\u00adally there were two epis\u00adodes in a row that impressed and I thought I\u2019d stumbled across a mind\u00adset from which to enjoy the show, but the crap epis\u00adode returned instantly. Look\u00ading back, the reason was because the two epis\u00adodes focused on the class issue instead of the pretty boys). Even\u00adtu\u00adally I tried the mind\u00adset of gender\u00adswap\u00adping. If this was an anime about one poor loser guy find\u00ading a club of beau\u00adti\u00adful women who nearly all fall for him, would my atti\u00adtude towards the show be any dif\u00adfer\u00adent. Well, yes it would. I would have had a far easier time dis\u00admiss\u00ading the show as crap instead of spend\u00ading end\u00adless amounts of time wor\u00adry\u00ading that I wasn\u2019t approach\u00ading the show with the right mindset.\\n\\n\r\nPlease don\u2019t go telling me this is a par\u00adody. The way Haruhi enters the aban\u00addoned music room the Host Club screams wish ful\u00adfill\u00adment. You too could find a room full of beau\u00adti\u00adful men, all of whom are in love with each other as much as they are in love with them\u00adselves, and hav\u00ading them attend to you. I didn\u2019t watch this all to the end. I gave up after the epis\u00adode where Honey hurt his tooth. The epis\u00adode was set up entirely so they could have homo\u00aderotic scenes between Honey and that big bloke who never talks. They even go so far as to call it pure and utter moe in the show itself. By that stage I had seen enough\\n",

            "content": "Title: Ouran High School Host Club\r\nManga, Anime: Ouran High School Host Club was originally a manga created by Bisco Hatori that began running in Hakusensha's LaLa magazine on August 5th, 2003, and is still ongoing.  It has been licensed Stateside by Viz Media, and the releases are up to the 10th volume Stateside as of February 5th, 2008, while it currently stands at 12 collected volumes in Japan.  \r\nOuran High School Host Club is a twenty-six episode series that was produced by Studio Bones (famous for their work on Darker than BLACK and Fullmetal Alchemist) and directed by Takuya Igarashi (famous for hiswork on random episodes of Sailor Moon and Darker than Black).  It ran on Japanese television from April 4th to September 26th, 2006.  It has been licensed Stateside by Funimation, though it has yet to actually give a release date.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Haruhi Fujioka is a scholarship student attending the ultra-wealthy Ouran Academy, so poor that she can't even afford the uniform.  One day, as she's trying to find a quiet place to study, she comes across the Third Music Room and the Ouran High School Host Club (if you don't know what a host club is, it's basically a bunch of guys flirting with women for profit).  As she's trying to leave, she breaks a vase worth about $80,000, and is soon employed doing menial tasks to pay off her debt.  Unfortunately, her short hair cut, outfit, and large glasses make her look like a guy, and they soon promote her to host after they figure out she has a lot of potential.  She's a big hit, and even after they finally figure out that she's a girl, they have her stay on and conceal her gender, as she's such a hit, and she can repay her debt faster that way.  Most of the series focuses on the customers and the members of the Host Club.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, if it weren't for the fact that this were a screwball romantic comedy, this would be a fairly standard customer/problem of the week series.  However, it's because the series does not hesitate to turn its fairly sarcastic sense of humor back on itself that it succeeds so well.  Ouran openly makes fun of several genre tropes of shoujo, and by openly having characters point them out, and breaking the fourth wall while they're at it, manages to create amazing moments of meta (self-referential moments, for those of you not famliar with fandom terms).  It also has several good running gags that manage not to get old.\\n\\n\r\nAdd to this the fact that every character in the Club gets some kind of development and background (though I do have issue with where this falls, but see Length for more about that), as do minor recurring characters, and you've got a fairly solid show.  It's not anything that's ZOMG SPEKTAKULAR, but it's still a pretty good show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I really like how Bones did this series.  The lines that are used in the show are a bit thicker than the lines in most anime, which just makes the characters stand out that much more, and are especially effective when they use SD for humor moments.  You can barely tell when CG's used, and the 2D animation itself is very fluid.  The colors in general are very vibrant, and I actually found myself wondering how they got some of the exact colors that they did (especially Eclair's eyes), because they were absolutely beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, a fact that particularly endears this series to my heart is that they had the guy who did the series composition and scripts for Revolutionary Girl Utena doing the same for this (Yoji Enokido), which means that we got a lot of Utena-esque imagery, in how there's lots and lots of symbolism using mundane objects.  (The only reason I really noticed this was because I'm watching Utena with my school's anime club at the moment, and I saw a lot of similarities.)\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The background music for this series is extremely exaggerated and over the top, which isn't that much different from how the entire series is.  I don't know how it would stand on its own, but in context with the scenes that it's used in, it's a perfect combination.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and the ED are a special case.  They're the stereotypical female JPop upbeat number and a rousing rock number, respectively, and, in any other series, would not impress me that much.  They do here, though.  And I don't know WHY.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: Maaya Sakamoto (famous for her roles as Aeris Gainsborough in FFVII: Advent Children and Hitomi in Escaflowne) plays Haurhi, and Takehito Koyasu (famous for his roles as Touga in Revolutionary Girl Utena and Hotohori in Fushigi Yuugi) makes an appearance here and there as her father.  Otherwise, all the seiyuu managed to capture their characters' qualities perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nLength: The only problem I have with this series is where they placed background information and character development.  The former came after the latter, and, overall, it probably would have made a lot more sense to reverse the order, and maybe place it more towards the earlier end of the series more than the latter half.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, though, twenty-six episodes was a solid decision.  I think they could've trimmed a few episodes off, but overall, the length was pretty solid.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A screwball romantic comedy that's not afraid to have moments of meta and make fun of itself and its tropes, with excellent seiyuu, art and imagery, and music that fits the moments perfectly.  Could have lost a few episodes and rearranged the order a bit, but hey, it's still pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 9/10\\n\r\nLength: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 43/50; 86% (B )",

That means I'm MALE, and that this show's target demographic does not include me.  I am well aware of this fact, and all the more baffled because of it.\r\nI'm going to skip over the \"humor\" and the characters and the plot and everything else and go straight for the one thing that made me hate this anime: Ouran is quite possibly the most sexist anime I've everseen.  It discriminates and bashes on women more than any other show I've ever seen, including those stupid slave/maid hentai shows.\\n\\n\r\nOne scene in particular illustrates this very well:\\n\r\nHaruhi sees some of the Host Club's clients getting bullied by a couple of men, and she stands up to the bullies.  The rest of the Host Club rush to her aid, protect her, and then scold her for taking things into her own hands.  If that weren't enough, the show villainizes Haruhi afterwards, making it seem as if she did something wrong.  She is forced to (rather, guilt-tripped into) apologize for acting \"rashly\" (aka \"doing something\").\\n\\n\r\nWhy does this happen?\\n\\n\r\nOh right, because Haruhi is a woman.  And women are supposed to do nothing but sit around all day at the top of castles and wait for their knights in shining armor to rescue them.  Yeah.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the VICTORIAN AGE, people.  This is the 21st century.  Here, we have women screaming their lungs off about women's rights.  There's women's suffrage.  Women have been working their asses off for this past century to establish themselves in Americ-\\n\\n\r\nOH, THAT'S RIGHT.  This was made in JAPAN, the land of the Office Lady and tentacle porno, where women are treated like dirt and paid accordingly.  Apparently, animation companies think they like being treated like dirt.  And with the insane popularity of this series, you'd think women actually feel that way.",

            "content": "I would recommend this show even if you aren't a fan of the romantic comedy genre. It is an incredibly fun show. Even if you aren't super keen on reverse harem this show doesn't take itself seriously enough for that to be a major issue. There is of course a fair bit of romance for those of you who are looking for that but for me this was a show that was more comedy than romance. It has a really nice mix of silliness with a touch of sweet.\r\nThis isn't a show that will blow your mind with art. I found the style a littledated, but for me that is never really a problem, the poster should give you a good sense of whether it is a problem for you. It is typical shoujo style really, big eyes, lithe framed men. Similarly the music is pretty standard and unremarkable. \\n\\n\r\nThe story I found to be enjoyable. It's more situational with episodes revolving around their daily antics, until towards the end where things build nicely to what I found to be quite an amusing ending.\\n\\n\r\nBut this is not really a story driven show. It's a show you watch for the crazy situations, the overblown stereotypes and the ridiculous factor particularly of the male lead. Just on him, he confused me at first because they claimed he was the \"prince\" type. For those of you unfamiliar with the term it basically describes that perfect guy who is good at everything, has a slim build, super popular and a bit of a charmer. But I found him in reality to be quite different. He is more of a parody of the ridiculousness of that ideal, and kind of an idiot, so in the beginning I didn't know what to make of him. As time goes on though I really came to enjoy him, he is actually really likable and I like a leading man who you can laugh at. To me that is what makes Ouran Highschool Host Club stand out; the way that it laughs at itself.\\n\\n\r\nSo bottom line? If you like shoujo romcoms or reverse harem this is a must see! If you don't but you think you are open to watching one this would be the one to watch. If you can't stand shows about highschool and romance then I wouldn't watch it but trust me you are missing out!",

            "content": "I really enjoyed this anime.  More so than a lot of of other stories, it was witty and clever and just that amusing.  It's one of those animes where *everything* is pointed in the same direction; it's cohesive and put together like a Swiss watch.\r\nOn an each-episode basis, the story may not be so great... it's a little erratic.  Some episodes are better than others and I definitely have my favorites and have ones I'll probably always skip over.  But the whole arc of the story from first episode to last?  Terrific!  And the good parts are so goodthat it's easy to tolerate the less-good. ;)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, despite their flaws, are endearing and incredibly charming (well, with the exception of a few).  You start out with these cutout sterotypes and during the course of the season, each one of them becomes more and more three dimensional.; it's almost like getting to know a person.  You get past their &quot;type&quot; and into who they are and why and how and their individual strengths and weaknesses... it says a lot about judging a book by its cover.  And that sort of thing sounds like it would be trite and cheesy, I know.  The amazing thing is that it isn't... or even when it is, it's still so charming that it's nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and music are lavish and rich and perfect for the tone of the show.  Sometimes their faces aren't so detailed or distinguishable, but I think it goes hand in hand with the basic premise that there's more going on than just how they look.  Their wealth, which plays a huge part in Haruhi's (the leading female role) interaction with the host club, is almost like another member of the cast -- marble molding, the reflection of a room on the face of the clock, the immense sprawl of the campus, the rooms, of everything.  I like the bubbly, perky opening and I think it fits the playful tone of the story very, very well.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if you can tell, but I ***love*** this show.  I love it when Tamaki's naivete (and I always giggle when he sulks in the corner); I love the nurturing/suffocating bond of the twins; and I love how unflappable and &quot;normal&quot; Haruhi is.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing is... I don't really know what it means to &quot;grow mushrooms in someone else's storage room&quot;?  Any hints? =)",

            "content": "As a heterosexual male, I am not into girly anime, so when my girlfriend insisted I watched a reverse harem, I instantly thought this will be a soppy, chick flic anime about who know's what. After watching this anime, I now know how completely and utterly wrong I was. Instead of a perverted anime about 5 guys trying into get in some girl's pants, it is a comedy filled anime that isn't centered around the romance aspect of it.\r\nStory: 9.34/10 *Review\r\nHaruhi Fujioka is a tomboyish, poor female student who enters Ouran Highschool that is populated excessively by the wealthy (besides her). Upon entering the highscool,she tries finding a quite place to study, and enters the Music Room at the school, to her surprise finds the Ouran Highschool Host Club. After showing disinterest, and as she was about to leave, Haruhi breaks the host club's precious vase, and to pay back, she must work for them as a member of the Host Coub. *The story is original, and is actually appealing to not only girls, but to anyone looking for a good laugh. It mad me laugh along with the characters, and I even started shipping character's together (I hope no one finds out I watched this). This anime pacing was great, and the quality of it was better then a few of my favorites. Overall I give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art was high quality, the scenery detailed, and the the characters were animated beautifully. All the boys were attractive (I'm straight), and so where the woman. The animation had higher quality than most *cough* Soul Eater *cough*. I give it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.56/10 \\n\r\nThe voice acting was fluent and the voices fit the character's personalities very well. I watched this in dubbed and subbed, and I was supprised to hear Vic Morgonoan play Tamaki Suo in the dubbed. He played this part very well and i give him an A+. The opening theme song \"Sakura Kiss\" was catchy and modern, while the ending didn't seem to fit that well. Overall I give a very high 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8.23/10\\n\r\nThe characters design and personalities are refreshing, and the overall appeal of all the Host Club was great. Haruhie wasn't an annoying D.I.D (damsel in distress), the twins were hilarious (though it made me uncomraftable to watch them do the twincest thing), and Tamaki was annoying. But it was your good annoying, because that's his personality and it definitely shown through (lol). The characters were organized very well and it did have lots of character devolpment. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.41/10 (Oustanding)\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime, and all of it was great to watch. One thing that bothered me was the parts about \"Harhuie in Wonderland\" I'm not sure what that was about, but it was diffrent. It reminded me of \"Ciel in Wonderland\" from Black Butler. Not sure who copied who there. But overall this anime is entertaining and extremely fun to watch. I liked the comedy involved and how it doesn't completely focus on the romance of two characters. Finally a show not about 2 characters getting it on! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.75/10 (Oustanding)\\n\r\nAfter getting over my myself, and sucking up to watch this anime, I am glad I did. Art, characters, sound and story, are good. My girlfriend is glad I enjoyed it, and I get to pick the anime (SAO FTW). While this was out of my comfort zone, I'm glad I watched it and I hope you enjoy it as well.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR : Watched a reverse harem and liked it, got brownie points from gf.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I had heard about Ouran High School Host Club, I'm guess around last summer. A friend of mine was rabid about it, however, for some reason or another, I didn't read the manga... Later that summer my other friend also went rabid for it, and again I ignored it.... It wasn't until I read Kanashimi's review for it when I decided to watch the seemingly popular show.\rThe story is basically about a student by the name of Haruhi Fujioka who gets into a prestigious school for rich kids, and how she stumbles in on the school's \"Host Club\" and ends up having to become ahost (and cross-dress) to repay the club for breaking the vase. After this the anime's story line follows the activities of the club and it's members.\\n\\n\rStory -\\n\\n\rI can't really think of any really good words for Ouran's story. However, I found that the first episode had managed to suck me in and I was watching it like a rabid crazy person, just to see what would happen to the characters. Some of the episodes, especially episodes six and thirteen, seemed rather... unimportant, and while I did enjoy them I was ready to go on to the next episode. Also, I found myself slightly unsatisfied with the end, after all when you end something you like a lot, you're going to want more of it right? \\n\\n\rScore: 8\\n\\n\rAnimation -\\n\\n\rOuran High School Host Club has got some nice animation, and while it's rare for me to say that any anime has bad animation, I have to say Ouran's was... okay, you get what I mean. During the first episode when Haruhi was changing, and I saw her reflection in the background, for some reason I was amazed, maybe it was because it was there, or something else, however, it was... yeah. The animation also seemed akin to that of Fruits Basket, I'm sure I'm not the only one who has noticed this, however, at times because of this, my mind referred Hunny to Momiji...\\n\\n\rScore: 9\\n\\n\rSound - \\n\\n\rI liked the background music... I'm not entirely sure why, but I found it very fitting to the show... The opening theme, \"Sakura Kiss\" is pretty catchy, and while I do like the song, after episode seven or so, I started to skip listening to it, as for the ending song, I can't say that I know what it's called, seeing as the only times I have even bothered to listen to it were when the song was present during the episodes, but it's not really because I don't like it, it's just a habit.\\n\\n\rThe voice acting... Woah.. What can I say? Since Ouran hasn't been dubbed yet (and why not? Someone please licsense it?), I had to watch it subbed, which is not really something I like to do, however, I really like the Japanese voice acting for Ouran. Haruhi sounded convincingly like a young boy, and all the other voices suited their characters well. \\n\\n\rScore: 9\\n\\n\\n\rCharacters - \\n\\n\rAh. The characters... Well, I found all the main characters likable, and they all managed to leave very distinct impressions of who they were in my mind. Their actions, Tamaki especially, are very fun to watch, and some of them are very easy to picture in my mind, while I know that I haven't gotten them all covered... It is hard to tell if certain characters actually grow and change a bit, which is why I wish it was longer, however, I suppose that it's more realistic that way, since people don't change that fast.\\n\\n\rScore:  10\\n\\n\\n\rOverall -\\n\\n\rI really liked Ouran High School Host Club a lot, so much that it was able to tie itself with my previous number one title, Black Cat, and that I started to look for the manga. I do wish that the series was longer, so I could enjoy the host club more, however it'll be a miracle if there is another season. And if you're wondering, if this does get liscensed soon, and I hope it does, I will be buying it.. Though that fact is a bit irrelevant.\\n\\n\\n\rYay!: The characters are amazing! Diverse and... amazing. Renge, who I didn't like in the beginning also started to grow on me.\\n\\n\rNay~: Well, I'd say the plot suffered the most, seeing as I wanted more, and well... yeah. It needed more of the host club, and not the one act characters.\\n\\n\rScore: 9 kitties outta 10.",

            "content": "If I had to describe it in one word, it&rsquo;ll be this word : PERFECT. \r\nI had no qualms about it at all. Even Renge became acceptable at the end. I just love the plot, the cute topics per episode. It was done so beautifully. I have to say, whoever made Ouran knew me well. Back then I didn&rsquo;t know there was fan service for girls because I&rsquo;ve never witnessed it before. Now I know there is such a thing! I just love it when the guys go topless! \r\nEvery episode was so great. Every topic was charming and funny, which is what I loveabout it. My favorite episodes were Hikaru and Haruhi&rsquo;s date. That episode made me squeal so much, but then again, I squeal at almost every episode. Like I said, the creators know me too well. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot was so cleverly crafted. It was so simple and yet it had so much depth. Here we have a girl who was made to act and live like a guy, and she didn&rsquo;t even see it coming &ndash; the same goes for the rest of the host club too. They didn&rsquo;t know a girl like Haruhi would come into their lives (Aren&rsquo;t all Haruhis just great?), and affect them by their interactions with her. Boy, do I wish to be like Haruhi. She inspires me too &ndash; I also dream of being a lawyer someday, that&rsquo;s why I admire her so much. Another thing that I would like to add is that if Haruhi was a guy, I&rsquo;d definitely go after him. I would always forget that Haruhi&rsquo;s a girl sometimes (seems like it was that way for her too).\\n\\n\r\nI love the other characters too. I&rsquo;ve already mentioned I like Haruhi, but I like everyone else as well (except maybe that stupid &Eacute;clair girl). At first I thought Tamaki was the main man of this show who&rsquo;ll be charming and showy all the time, which would probably make me hate him. Thank God I was wrong, he turned out to be one of the funniest guys in the club and the-go to guy when it comes to comic relief. I love the twins too, I would cheer Hikaru on whenever he wants to make a move on Haruhi, but at the same time I sympathized for Kaoru since he is having a hard time because of all the anxiety in losing his brother, and his &ldquo;jealousy&rdquo; as well since obviously, he likes Haruhi too. Hunny was adorable too &ndash; I&rsquo;m not really into shotacon, but he&rsquo;s cute and funny nonetheless. Mori had the least number of lines, but boy is he handsome. Finally, my favorite out of the bunch, ah yes, the cool type &ndash; Kyoya. He is one sexy God, and I love how underhanded he is. \\n\\n\r\nI even liked some of the supporting characters Haruhi&rsquo;s dad was just awesome and well, pretty. Arai-kun, Haruhi&rsquo;s friend from middle school, was charming as well. Bossa Nova &ndash; kun was kinda funny too. The episode where he was first introduced was one of my favorites, and Nekozawa &ndash; senpai is cool as well. Who knew that underneath the cape he too is a bishonen, just as handsome as Tamaki can be. There are also the lobelia girls, which reminded me of MariMite. I don&rsquo;t really like them, but since they reminded me of one of my favorite series they&rsquo;re acceptable. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the other stuff. Drawing style was simple, but nice nonetheless. At first I thought it was CLAMP\\'s work since Tamaki kinda looked like Fye from TRC, and there was also the tall and stringy look of the characters (plus, there were a lot of bishonens too). It was perfect the way it is, and I think that a more complicated drawing style would overshadow the storyline. The colors were a bit solid and cutesy, but it fit the series wonderfully. I don&rsquo;t think shading and varying colors would&rsquo;ve been suitable. I&rsquo;m just glad the colors didn&rsquo;t clash. I love the details too. I&rsquo;m very critical and observant when it comes to details. I couldn&rsquo;t ignore the wonderful wall and ceiling designs. There were also the shojo frames and flowers that were intricate in design. I think they used a bit of CG on the beautiful chandeliers, but I&rsquo;m not sure about that. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was another part I liked about it. I&rsquo;ve been into Chieko Kawabe ever since I watched Elfen Lied, so having her on the soundtrack was a plus. Sakura Kiss will definitely be one of my anime song favorites forever. The ending song was also pretty good. I didn&rsquo;t like it at first, probably because I&rsquo;m too busy reflecting about what just happened in a certain episode but after a few episodes it grew on me. I didn&rsquo;t really have time to notice the BGM &ndash; I did at first (I wrote down on my notebook that it was good, so I guess it was good) but after awhile I channeled all my attention to the story. Which rocked, by the way &ndash; can&rsquo;t say that enough. I do vaguely remember a couple of classical music inserts throughout the series, specifically heard when Tamaki plays the piano or during their socials. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was also wonderful. The seiyus matched their characters perfectly, specially the twins&rsquo; seiyus. They added color to the twins&rsquo; antics. Oh yeah, Maaya Sakamoto&rsquo;s definitely my favorite seiyu now. She did such a good job on portraying Haruhi. Kudos to that as well. I did feel sorry for Mori&rsquo;s seiyu, whoever he is. I know he only said &ldquo;ah&rdquo; most of the time, but I still hope he was paid well. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe the fandom affected me too &ndash; people who barely watch anime talk about it, so I was wondering what was good about it. Finally I got to see for myself, and I really am hooked I&rsquo;m always smiling from ear to ear whenever I&rsquo;m watching it, and I stay that way until after I watch it.. Seriously, this series warms my heart. It&rsquo;s an automatic pick-me-up for me, that&rsquo;s why I love it so much. If I had to pick one series I will watch for the rest of my life, it would be this one, and I might even take it to the other world. FYI, I haven&rsquo;t got enough of it yet. I&rsquo;ll be watching it over and over until I get tired of it ( and that is highly unlikely.)",

            "content": "On the technical side of things, the animation in Ouran is top-tier for shoujo. Like its characters, this series is spoiled rotten with Studio Bones great animation staff, getting both the pretty design work of shoujo that we expect and fluid A-list animation that we don\u2019t. Every inch of the Barbie Kremlin is immaculately detailed, and the character designs are very\u2026appealing. (SQUEE! ^_^) \r\nThe music in Ouran is all waltzes, ballads and sweeping orchestral pieces, and all that beautiful, dramatic music is used not with reverence, but for satire, and it makes everything so much funnier than in the standard comedy with cartoon jingles. Italso helps to keep the mood uniform when some minor drama surfaces and that same music CAN be used seriously\u2026but just for a second. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voicework, I don\u2019t know Japanese, but I\u2019ve heard a lot of comedies in the language, and Ouran has one of the funniest casts of seiyuu in a romantic comedy. It is mind-blowingly funny if you can keep up with it, but even if you can\u2019t, you should at least give the awesome Japanese track a listen at some point. To give your eyes a rest, there\u2019s the dub, which as you may expect, has a LOT to live up to now. I\u2019m not sure they could ever be better than the subbed result. But I am happy to say that they may be just as good, and probably deserve a medal just for pronouncing all the dozens of Japanese words in the show perfectly. Caitlin Glass sounds perfectly tomboyish with just a hint of femininity that has all those hosts in such a hot tizzy, the twins have fairly different voices that make a harmonious blend put together, Kyoya\u2019s delivery is just as sexily serpentine as it should be, and Hunny is sticky sweet syrupy cuteness on a bun-bun, and then there\u2019s Tamaki, the hardest part of them all to play. Now yes, he plays the part a little different from the brilliant Mamoru Miyano, but well, consider the age difference: he\u2019d have to. Still, Vic Mignogna completely works the part in every direction and is absolutely hilarious. Did I forget someone? No, I guess not. (You see, Mori has about four lines in the whole show...)\\n\\n\r\nSo I spent a lot of time elaborating on this show\u2019s fine pedigree because really, that\u2019s most of the appeal. It\u2019s just a filthy-rich, la vida loca slumber-party show and it looks like that party has hung a sign on the door that says \u201cNo Boys Allowed.\u201d But let me get serious for a moment and talk about the humor. It can be smart satire, stupid slapstick, or both at the same time, but whatever the case, this is one of the funniest anime I have ever seen, period, and the humor is broad in appeal. \\n\\n\r\nThis show makes fun of anime stereotypes, rich people, moe-crazed fangirls, high school angst, gender differences, just every nerdy and teen-centric topic imaginable and then just settles down for some a good old game of hit the funny French person. Throughout it all, the fourth wall is hardly ever standing. I think if Tex Avery and Chuck Jones had written Saved By the Bell, this would have exploded into being. So on the note of male appeal, I do know some guys who can\u2019t get over the repulsive level of manservice in Ouran, but I also know several guys who move past that and think it\u2019s just as funny as all the girls do. You may just have to test the waters, gentlemen. You are venturing into the wild unknown, but it may well be worth the dip!\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, that still doesn\u2019t make this show anymore than a really good-looking gigglefest, so Ouran decides to completely risk its enjoyment factor in the greatest mistake of all anime comedies: trying to be dramatic. I mean, how in the world is this stupid harem crossdresscapade ever supposed to be taken seriously?\\n\\n\r\nIt works, though.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t ask me how, but every once in a while, this show starts reaching for your heartstrings, and it almost always works. It may steer too close to corny once or twice, but most of the time it\u2019s incredibly heartwarming, and I think this is 100% due to the likability of the cast. Everyone that watches this show ends up with a favorite host, but there\u2019s not one of the cast that isn\u2019t fun to watch or ever wears out their welcome. Well, except Renge, but she\u2019s an otaku, and we all know how annoying those freaks are. (wink wink, nudge, nudge)\\n\\n\r\nStill, it really feels like the way I wish my high school had been, complete with belly laughs, happy sighs, and sexy guys. Don\u2019t hate \u2018em cause they\u2019re beautiful, just put the fun back in dysfunctional and you will feel no pain as they drive you insane.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Ouran is an always-inviting self-parody with just as much heart as glitz, glam, and girly guys. It ranges from smart to stupid all at the same time, is drop-dead hilarious no matter your gender, but of course offers just a little more for the ladies, and does it all with style.\\n\\n\r\n*THIS IS A PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF MY VIDEO REVIEW WHICH CAN BE SEEN HERE:\\n\\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJNbm4H1OrI\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Charming, comedic, and thoroughly enjoyable.  These three phrases are the perfect descriptors of Ouran High School Host Club, a \"romantic\" (but it's not really romance), \"high school\" (if your high school was also attended by the children of multi-millionaires) comedy that simultaneously pokes fun of at the types of anime that it spawns from as well as crafting an elegant story that stems from that very genre.\r\nOuran's characterization is its strong-point: each individual is an exaggeration of an anime template, taken to its very (il)logical extreme.  You have your lovable caretaker, your brooding mastermind, your \"loli shota-type\", a stoic guardian, and a pairof twins, lost in each other's world.  Thrown into this multidimensional cast of characters if Fujioka Haruhi, an independent spirit, who doesn't fit in with the throngs of rich kids (not that she cares to), due to her &quot;commoner&quot; origins.  Together, they are the &quot;Host Club&quot;, paying hired attention to the captivated ladies who have entirely too much time and money that fill the ranks of the Ouran Academy.  As the series progresses, you discover the backgrounds behind each of the main characters, and how they came to be what they are today.  In addition, you witness the numerous escapades of Suou Tamaki, leader of the Host Club, always guiding the hosts forward towards ever-increasing extravagance.\\n\\n\r\nThe brilliantly-crafted characters mesh together to create an image of the &quot;day-to-day&quot; activities of the students at the Ouran Academy.  While the primary setting of the story is a high school, almost no academic schooling of any type occurs throughout the series - the focus is squarely upon the activities of the Host Club.  Whether it be an excursion to some tourist location, an intrusion into Haruhi's &quot;common&quot; life, or a flashback into the pasts of one or more of the characters, the story never feels forced or artificial.  The course of events flow naturally, the flashbacks coincide with events in the present day that share a common lesson with the events preceding it.  And, above all else, the comedy is omnipresent and ludicrously fitting the moment, the crown example being Tamaki's Inner Mind Theater, which shows the twistedly exaggerated thoughts going through Tamaki's mind in reaction to something happening.\\n\\n\r\nThere are, however, a few negatives with respect to the story.  In particular, the plot seems to linger along during the middle part of the series, after the introductions of the individual characters are done, but before the series really gets started with their backgrounds and flashbacks.  These episodes could probably have been condensed, or somehow made to fit with the character backgrounds in order to supply more development time for the thrilling concluding arc of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective, Ouran also delivers.  The soundtrack is soothing when it needs to be, reminiscent when it needs to be, and powerful as well, when it needs to be.  Between the smooth melodic background piano to the rumbling guitar intro to the ending theme, Ouran's music certainly fits the mood.  The sound effects themselves are also natural and expected.  You will get used to the sound of flower petals blowing the breeze, as well as the lifting and setting down of countless tea cups.  Visually, the style in Ouran is unique, especially with its stylized facial expressions.  However, the art style does seem to be lacking at times, in that it occasionally fails to convey the full power of the emotions behind a scene.  In particular, while each of the individual facial expressions are well-done, there seems to be too few of them, at least too few to match the needs of the series at large.  However, this is but a small problem in the grand scheme of things, and should not deter anyone more watching this excellent series.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're tired of the ordinary, or just want to laugh endlessly at the oftentimes formulaic aspects of characterization and plot used in romance anime, pick up Ouran High School Host Club.  The hosts will be waiting for you.",

One of the best animes watched after Yamato Nadeshiko Shinchi Henge (which is still not finished yet.. haha.. Still waiting for epi 25). \r\nThe plot is very simple but as the story unfolds, we are able to see life in and beyond high school and how these 5 Bishounen boys and 1 indifferent girl cope with their troubles / misgivings. \r\nWell, the ending did indicate a hint of something, but since the story stops only at 26, we won\\'t noe ifthat something will develop into something more.. Haha.. I\\'m currently reading the manga.. We\\'ll see if that particular something develops in the manga itself (wich I hope so.. hehe..).\\n\\n\r\nTo those who hae doubts watching this anime, you might wanna try watching an epi or two before deciding to slash it totally from your list.. I was doubtful at firts.. but I read the manga, got hooked to the storyline and went online to download the anime.. \\n\\n\r\nFor those who are going to watch.. ENJOY!!!!",

            "content": "Ouran Host Club mocks all your shoujo stereotypes while simultaneously utilizing those same stereotypes to create a wonderful series. I'd say that takes talent.\r\nSTORY - I avoided this series for a long time just because the premise didn't interest me, and from a distance, it seemed like one of those parodies that would err on the side of taking itself too seriously. I'm really glad I ended up giving it a chance though; Ouran High School Host Club manages to be hilarious from the get-go and is surprisingly adorable. It's perfect in portraying the handful of stereotypes that appear over and over again in shoujoand doesn't shy away from blatant self-references and mockery to make sure it doesn't take itself too seriously. And yet, the series somehow still manages to have a captivating &quot;serious&quot; side and great romance potential. \\n\\n\r\nI like to gripe a lot about anime adaptations of manga that aren't finished too, but Host Club has an excellent and concluded storyline (with huge potential for a sequel!) despite the still-running manga. Admittedly, I haven't read much of said manga yet, but from what I can tell, the anime follows it pretty damn precisely. Many of the episodes are very silly and episodic, and there's also the predictable handful of episodes dedicated to each character's backstory, but there's rarely a dull moment. It's entertaining and fun through and through.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - For a cast conceived entirely of over-used stereotypes, Host Club really does an amazing job in keeping everyone interesting, especially since it isn't afraid to point out those obvious type molds. There isn't really anything particular or unique about Haruhi, but that's exactly what makes her so easy to relate to. Her androgyny only furthers this by destroying that gender barrier, and honestly, I'd love to see more reverse traps in anime. Haruhi is great at balancing characteristics that are considered typical of both men and women, and she's also endearingly oblivious. Never underestimate the power of stupidly endearing characteristics... Tamaki is a fun character for all the same reasons.\\n\\n\r\nHe has tons of little quirks -- many of them are common, but that doesn't stop them from being effective when they're so well done. Everyone gets those obligatory background episodes that explore their personalities beyond the stereotype. It's a tricky thing to give a parody a personality; how do you give them depth without seeming pretentious or just like the cliches you're trying to mock? I'm really not sure, but somehow Host Club manages. The twins have a completely generic emo twin backstory, but I'm still compelled to sympathize with them and to empathize with their friendships with the rest of the club. Kyouya has a similarly generic sibling angst story, but I still like the bastard. Mori and Honey weren't as interesting to me personally, but I can still see where their appeal would be for others.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it isn't so much the originality of the characters that make them so good -- it's their interaction with each other. Everything feels natural. It's just entertaining to watch them go about their shenanigans and to hear them mock one another, their genre, otaku culture, and random other things. And the subtlety of their strong friendships is what ties the whole series together. As the episodes build on, it gets clearer and clearer just how important those friendships are. Yes, this is a satire and a comedy, but there's a good story about friendship buried under all that too. It's a simple and generic story, but it's a good story all the same.\\n\\n\r\nARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - I really love the style and animation used in the opening theme. It's clean and cute and pretty unique-looking. Hell, the opening in general is just adorable and fun to look at, and it's one of the few that I actually sat through and watched more than a half dozen times. The style in the series itself is pretty generic, but as most of the characters were designed to be generic, this really isn't too big a deal. Indeed, all the characters perfectly master the visual charm that made their stereotypes so widely popular to begin with. And at the same time, the designs somehow manage to also capture the personal quirks that each character still has -- the twins are typical badboys, but their emotion is still there; there are probably twenty billion characters that look exactly like Kyouya, but somehow, he still feels like his own person. It's interesting (maybe it's the uniform?).\\n\\n\r\nThere are also lots of nice backgrounds in Host Club. It's a very fancypants and elaborate academy after all. Sure, a lot of the wide exterior shots and some of the interiors are recycled a lot, but they're still intricate and pretty backdrops. The animation is pretty average. There's nothing particularly spectacular, but I don't really think there's really anything that needs to look spectacular. Funny thing about shoujo, there aren't usually too many fights that need to be animated super smoothly. XD\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC - The opening theme, &quot;Sakura Kiss&quot; by Chieko Kawabe is a really cute song. It's upbeat and fun and just an all around fitting theme to the series in general. For the dub, the song is translated into English, and it works surprisingly well. The voice sounds exactly the same, and I really thought the singer just had two versions of the song at first. The translated lyrics work pretty nicely too. I didn't like the end theme as much as the opening, but that usually seems to be the case because they're just generally not as exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in the series is nicely varied. To emphasize the rich, upper class and noble environment, there are often classical instrumental themes; the moods are often exaggerated with very shrill, high-tension violins for the action and drama and soft, melancholic piano for the emotional and tragic scenes (cheerful, everyday scenes are usually accompanied by flutes and strings). It's good to note that even the music sticks with the over-the-top and satirical nature of many of the scenes. For more serious bits, the music follows suit and calms down to more traditional melodies, including several instrumental versions of the opening theme and the piano themes that Tamaki plays. As a fan of classical music, I tend to be drawn to soundtracks like this, but either way, I think everything suited Host Club very well.\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING - I saw the first half of the series dubbed (all that's currently available on DVD) and the rest subbed. It's been a while since I've seen a dub first, but Host Club's dub seriously impressed me. Vic Mignogna is the perfect Tamaki. He nails every line and every emotion, and it's just a very convincing performance overall. One of my biggest voice acting peeves is when actors don't change their voices between roles, which gets really annoying really fast in English dubs because there's such a limited talent pool. When Tamaki is acting flustered or funny!angry, he sounds a bit like Edward Elric, but for the most part, Mignogna manages to give the character a distinct voice, and I found that to be very impressive. Caitlin Glass as Haruhi was also pretty amazing, and I was again really happy to hear a distinct voice for the character. Honestly, the entire cast was excellent and all the voices were wonderfully suited to their roles (the only annoying voices were for the annoying characters!).\\n\\n\r\nIt seems that the English dub is aimed very much for an otaku crowd as well. A few honorifics are carried over without explicit explanation, particularly &quot;senpai&quot; and &quot;-chan,&quot; and the cute shortening of names before attaching the &quot;-chan&quot; (like Haru-chan or Hika-chan) is also kept. It was really weird hearing it at first, but all things considered, I think it turned out pretty well. It doesn't feel overly unnatural, and those little speech habits really keep characters like Honey and Haruhi truer to the original. (Now if only they could figure out a way to translate distinct first-person pronouns...) It's fitting since Host Club does so well to mock otaku culture, and it definitely added to the experience to hear such lulzy culture-generated terms like &quot;twincest.&quot; The translation felt very relevant and in-touch to the English-speaking otaku scene which was fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nThe original Japanese cast is pretty good too, but I don't think I like Mamoru Miyano as Tamaki as much as I like Vic Mignogna. While Mignogna only occasionally strays to Ed's voice, I often hear a host of other characters when I hear Miyano... of course, that might just be because I've heard more of Miyano's roles than Mignogna, but all the same. Maaya Sakamoto as Haruhi was better, and I found it hilarious that Haruhi's poor singing skills are emphasized when Sakamoto is such a lovely singer. I prefer the Hitachiin twins' Japanese voices to their English counterparts because they're easier to distinguish from one another, and that's one of the easiest ways I had to tell them apart. Since much of the rest of the cast is very stereotypical, their Japanese and English voices were about on the same level; the actors sounded typecasted, but that works just fine. Sometimes, I just get tired of reading subtitles, so while the original cast is good, I think Host Club's dub is one of the few I'd choose to watch over the sub if given the choice.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - I don't think I've ever wanted a sequel for a series as much as I do for this one. The ending is predictable but adorable and practically begs for a follow-up series -- how is it that Ouran High School Host Club mocks so much of what's common in shoujo, but somehow manages to use all the same formulas to make you love it? I suppose it's proof that even the most tired of cliches can be given new life if done right. There are no original ideas left, but there are still new, fun, and interesting ways to twist around what's around there. To all the skeptics, I highly recommend giving this series a shot. The first eight dub episodes are available streaming on FUNimation's website (the first three episodes are also available subbed). I was a skeptic too.",

            "content": "Story :9:  This anime is adapted from the manga series by Bisco Hatori and tells the story of a poor girl that was excepted in to a very rich high school.  She finds herself in debt for 8,000,000 yen and is forced to become the schools Host Club's dog until she pays it back.  The story is wonderfully rounded with mostly comedy and romance but it throws some drama in at the appropriate moments.  It kept me coming back for more and more and in the end it left me wanting.  I only gave it a nine because of somesmall missing people or story lines from the manga that I really enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nArt :10:  The art in Ouran is amazing.  Not necessarily the animation itself, but the storyboard was done beautifully.  It had a flavour all its own that sets it apart from the manga and from other animes in it's genre.  The use of the cut away scenes to express what the characters are feeling adds so much to the storyline by giving this wonderful &quot;oh I get it&quot; factor when the story is completely finished.  Definitely a 10!\\n\\n\r\nSound :10:  I am not really sure how I should rate the sound.  But I thought that the voice actors did a wonderful job and that the music was appropriate and at times really lovely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :10:  The one thing that I really enjoyed about this show was the character development.  The way you could follow the growth of the main characters and understand why they were who they were was just awesome.  The back stories were marvelously included in stages so you always knew what you needed to know about the people involved.  I was very surprised that I could learn so much about them in just 26 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :10:  If you haven't figured it out by now, I really enjoyed watching this show.  Not only the first time, but every time I have re watched it or showed it to friends, the enjoyment not only stays but adjust in an awesome way when you notice things you did not before.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :10:  This show as a whole definitely gets a 10 from me.  But don't just take my word for it, go, watch it now.",

            "content": "Probably one of the worst anime's I watched. Everything about the anime in my opinion is honestly horrible. Have you wanted to find out the real truth about this anime? Then look no further! Just read on!! :D\r\nStory 3/10: The story is honestly the worst plot I have ever heard, a girl goes to a rich school. Of course she has extremely short hair and looks like a man due to some 'gum incident'! Its overly predictable. There is too many of these stupid drama high school animes to begin with, though Ouran High School Host Club is by far the worst.This anime was supposed to have comedy in it, though not once did I find anything they said funny, what I find more pathetic is that they basically were begging you to laugh, saying the most stupid things. My response instead of laughing was actually 'why the hell am I still watching this?!' and many times I was seconds away from dropping the anime altogether.\\n\\n\r\nArt 2/10: The drawings are horrible. Over 90% of the anime I had no idea what was going on due to the lighting of the show. They made it too bright and I could barely tell what was going on, having to guess most of the time, as well as the horrible lighting it hurt my eyes in a few minutes, making me want to not even watch the rest of an episode. The background and environment was badly drawn as well, making it extremely unenjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound 3/10: They did a horrible job with the music choice. The music didn't flow nicely with the concept of the show. Although I'm not sure what could, since its such a horrible anime. The voices and recordings seems low and poor. I had to turn my speakers up very high to just barely hear what they were saying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10: The characters seemed to be forced to be a certin way thoughout the whole show, making it extremely distasteful. Honestly all the guys seemed like homosexuals to me, even if their personalities wern't acting like one. They all seemed cliche which was something I dislike very much. They all seemed like a joke to me and it was very diffacult for me to take any of them seriously, in the most serious of situations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10: It was honestly a pathetic show. I had not one ounce of enjoyment during any part of watching it. Me finishing it is even a miracle to myself and I often wonder how I got though such a horrible anime. The beginning even starts out horrible and I just continued watching hoping that it would get better, sadly it didn't. It was honestly a total waste of my time and if I could take make the time back I used to watch this anime I would in a heartbeat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 1/10: Overall, it was the worst and most pathetic excuse for an anime I have ever seen. I honestly don't consider it an anime, it seems more like a joke to me. Everything seemed to be written by a ten year old with some sort of issue. The story was horrible, the music was horrible, and the characters were a disgrace. Why people actually enjoy is anime is mystery to me. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you want to waste your time and be disappointed at the end then the pathetic excuse for the anime Ouran High School Host Club is the perfect show for you! Be expected to just be disappoined in the end, because it was a major disappointment to me. Of course I know that people will be offended by this review, but I'm just speaking the honest truth of this anime. Now that the truth is out, its you choice wether you want to waste your time or not.",

Well, Ouran just might be the perfect antidote to your melancholy - I guarantee that 5 minutes into the first episode of this anime and you will be laughing your head off at the genius absurdity of this show.\r\nEither that, or you'll leave IMMEDIATELY due to its stupidity and complete idiocy. But hey, most people stay, so why wouldn't you?\r\nStory:\r\nMost people are tired of the typical, cheesy shojo series where \"boy meets girl, they fall in love and live happily ever after\". I know for one that I am SICK ofsuch series. Ouran gives a refreshing new plot, where for once the heroine is not a complete air-head, and in fact is the voice of reason in the show! *gasps* The premise of a host club is just so new and unique that it's like sticking colour in a black-and-white photograph\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI am a sucker for good art. Bones has officially become my favourite animation studio due to the great work they did with OHSHC. The manga art was ok, but the anime art was -almost- flawless. Although it was simple, as they say, &quot;simple is art&quot;.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes accompany all 26 episodes. I have to say that Sakura Kiss was the perfect tune to open up each episode of OHSHC. The opening music fitted each frame perfectly. Background music is not that memorable, while the ending theme, Shissou, is not to my taste, but is decent enough. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nHatori Bisco has created the most memorable set of characters. For one, as I have mentioned before, for once in the history of anime the heroine is NOT a complete air-head, and is the voice of reason in the story! Haruhi gets a 10/10 from me, along with Kyouya and Honey-sempai. Character-wise, Tamaki's personality is not the most original (the devilishly handsome baka); neither are Hikaru and Kaoru's, but they get 9.5/10 for character development. You can just see how much Hikaru changes over the course of the story, which is really quite...heartwarming, if I may. \\n\r\nFrom the exuberant Tamaki, to the calculating Kyouya, to the stoic Mori, there will be someone in the host club that appeals to your taste.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nOut of all the shows I've ever watched, OHSHC is probably the one show where I've laughed every single episode. Once, I even fell out of my chair laughing. Does that explain why I gave it a 10/10 for enjoyment?\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThis anime is probably one of the only ones I will ever rewatch. It's such a delightful romantic comedy. With a group of beautiful bishounen to boot, the Ouran High School Host Club is sure to sweep you off your feet. \\n\\n\r\nStep into the Third Music Room, into the world of Ouran High School. You'll not regret it. \\n\\n\r\nPS. I am pretty new to writing reviews, so if you found this review unhelpful, please PM me or leave a comment on my profile telling me why!",

            "content": "So, lets get one thing straight. You don't watch Ouran High school host club because you want to learn interesting things, feel great passion, think a whole lot about life, see beautiful art, hear beautiful music, follow a moving and morally sound story or to see deep and realistic characters that you can identify with... No, you watch it cause it's fun, and isn't that kind of what it's all about, anyway? \r\nNO SPOILERS\r\nOuran high school host club is unapologetically extravagant, intensely cliche, overly dramatic, a teensy bit ridiculous *cough* and all of it's characters are freaking stereotypes, but it's like: \"Yeah, so? Who cares?\"It's quite clean cut. It's an anime you don't have to think about, everything is basically exactly as it seems. If you don't like that, don't watch it. I personally found myself enjoying it a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters do not have that much depth, they are given some backstory after you've gotten used to them. It was cute, it was corny, it was nothing you haven't seen before. That's the charm of the thing, though. So many anime try to be interesting, just by having an sad backstory, a dark plot or complicated characters, but they completely miss something that I really need in an anime. Comfort. FUN. Ouran high school host club just makes me happy, it makes me laugh. I won't feel guilty if I forget the entire plot in a month. And if I don't even remember watching it a year from now, all the better, I can go watch it again.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to sit here picking it apart any further because it's just not that kind of anime. Something doesn't have to have a lasting impact to be great. So if you're looking for a nice, happy, funny, cute filler anime, please just go watch it. It won't be your all time favorite, but you'll probably have a good time.",

It was really sad it ended, but it looks like there would be a second season. This shows deserves a second season!\r\nI sooo love this show. ;) \r\nThe characters are so diverse yet so tightly knit together thatyou can't help but love them. Haruhi (the female protagonist) is not the usual silly bordering to stupid female character,  its really refreshing to see that kind of composed character in a female lead. I looovvee her.\\n\\n\r\nThe boys... oohh I love the boys! I can't even choose who I wanted to be with Haruhi. One episode I wanted it to be Hikaru, then one time I'm leaning towards Tamaki, and then unexpectedly I wanted it to be Kyouya! \\n\\n\r\nThis is really one of the most if not the most enjoyable anime I have seen to date.\\n\\n\r\nYou should see this ;)",

            "content": "To be honest I am thinking about dropping this after seven episodes. \r\nI didn't really like the manga either but I have a refusal to drop anything unless it is absoletly ridiculious. \r\nThe story was certainly different from other school related anime. You start out being introduce to the main character talking and shortly after you meet the host club. Short and a bit fast paced but that was the same as the manga also. I didn't like the randomness of it really, I found it rather annoying yet funny at the same time. The story doesn't say much other then take you into bitsof a troubling life for a young rich heir but really it is a story of romance believe it or not. I could barely tell with all the randomness going about. \\n\\n\r\nAnother five for the art. Though it was bright and pretty as some would say I didn't like it all that much. Character's limbs looked like rather like rubber sticks then real limbs and the heads seemed a bit smaller and thinner than adverage. The eyes were normal and the hair was indeed flowing but it could have done much better. I liked the background art more then the character's art. It was lovely draw and had a magificiant glow thanks to the animation. It could have done better without the blurness around it or sparkles but it was good. Character's art not so much. \\n\\n\r\nThree for sound.. Now the reason for me wanting to drop it instantly was because of the english cast chosen for this. And this is where the rating will lower. The english cast was horrible.. just.. urgh it was bad.. very bad. I wished for my ear-drumbs to shatter because of how bad it was. Funimation was terrible once again at picking the cast and there is the proof with the voices. One listen and you are annoyed by Haruhi, be introduced to the host club and there after you'll just want to rip your ears off. Absolutely poorly done. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 or 2 was because them capturing the background noises alright but really the voices diracted me terribly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were decent enough. I didn't like the voices cause the did not match and just made the characters sound very.. how do I put this... incredible bad. Blunt and innoscent enough for you. I didn't like the character's art very much and to be honest their personalities could have used a tad bit more work but they were decent and I somewhat enjoyed them. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for this was dreadful. I found it amusing somewhat yes... but in all honest opinions.. it was just dreadful. I did not enjoy the character's as I probably should, nor did I enjoy the art, music, etc. I just had trouble with this all together.. I barely could enjoy it with such terrible acting and the randomness of it. Just dreadful in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.. I did not really enjoy this series like the manga. I am seriously concidering dropping it but I don't know for sure yet. I did sort of like it but.. 'shakes' head I just don't know. Funimation just did a dreadful job with this.",

However, this put emphasis on the really well developed characters and gave us a chance to understand them more and more as the show progressed, so by the end you feel as if you can really understand how everyone is feeling.\r\nThe musicwas good. i liked it, the tunes were catchy and although i cant understand Japanese at all the music itself was good enough to have me watch the credits every time.\\n\\n\r\nLunar did a good job subbing the series. although the sound quality for the few times a piano was played was low quality for some reason, and some of the subtitles sped by too quickly, it didn't take away from the series itself.\\n\\n\r\noverall, my impressing of the series goes beyond the scope of this short review. there isn't really much i can write about it, and i feel that the short bits i did say don't really cover my true feelings about the series. i can say, however, that the series was extremely enjoyable. if not for the story or plot, of even the art, the comedic value and the development make up for it 100%. i'd recommend this to anyone (if you like comedy). 10/10!",

            "content": "I'm going to be the odd one out here and say that OHSHC was okay. The concept is great; I love it, but how it plays out is less than stellar. \r\nThe story is about scholarship student Fujioka Haruhi, who attends a prestigious school for children who come from extremely wealthy families. While looking for a quiet place to study, Haruhi runs into the Host Club (yes, you read that correctly; the school has a host club) and ends up breaking an expensive vase. Haruhi now must pay off her \u00a58,000,000 debt by working as a manservant for the Host Club. Eventually they notice thatshe's actually pretty good looking and--thinking she's a guy--tell her that she can pay off her debt by working as a member of the school's Host Club. The plot after this is... well, there is none, really. Haruhi spends time in the Host Club, going on wacky adventures and all that fun stuff. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch this because you're looking for a good romcom, know that there's a lot of \"com\", but not so much of the \"rom\". The romance sub plot is dragged out extremely long, and very few episodes are even about that. There are only really five romance-focused episodes, and the romance really starts toward the end (don't get your hopes up, though; they don't even kiss, and their romantic relationship is basically just implied). \\n\\n\r\nThe romance subplot is kind of bland. One of the guys who has a crush on her actually seems to like her as a person, whereas the other (the main love interest), mistakes his feelings for her as familial instead of romantic (which I admit is very unique, and I've never seen before). One of the romance-focused episodes is actually focused entirely on one of the main character's feelings for her, and then they basically never mention that he likes her again even though the episode concluded absolutely nothing regarding their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a lot of stereotypes, but one of the refreshing things about it is that it makes fun of those stereotypes. The shota is extremely skilled in martial arts and has a fiery temper, the stoic is overprotective of his adorable cousin and barely ever leaves his side, the incestuous twins are actually just faking the twincest for s***s and giggles, and then the ikemen with the dark past isn't pretending to be pompous\u2014he's really just that big of a narcissist. The only real spot-on stereotype is the stoic megane with the \"four eyes, no soul\" trope, though it works. Then of course we have Haruhi, the foil, dragged along in the weirdness of the Host Club.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime at first, but after a while it became annoyingly repetitive. Actual plot followed by filler after filler after filler.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, if you're looking for a funny anime about random, silly adventures and don't mind an extremely slow romance sub plot, then you should definitely watch this anime. It's not bad, but I'm just not big on anime with extremely slow plot progress.",

            "content": "OHSHC is good for its comedy and  (relative)uniqueness as a reverse harem and \"romance\"(it's not brimming in it). Honestly, probably one of the best of its kind and something that would work great for any first-time anime watcher that just wants something easy and funny. Or any fan that wants the same.\r\nWhile the story isn't all that strong or amazing, the characters make up for it and might I say how refreshing Haruhi really is as a female lead? Seriously. Too often in romantic/comedic animes, the female lead is an airhead or portrayed as fairly stupid and obnoxious. Haruhi is highly intelligent, hardworking, witty,mature, realistic, and observant. She's everything more characters in anime should probably be... especially females. \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, there isn't a whole lot to say since Ouran isn't particularly deep or does much to make you question yourself, but it tries to teach life lessons, such as being able to rely on other people or to learn coping with unfamiliar situations/sensations(in the case of one of the twins). However, its ultimate purpose is to be entertaining and it doesn't fail.\\n\\n\r\nPossibly, the only downfall of the entire show is Renge. She is a personification for otaku's/weeabos and a useless character. If someone out there likes her, good on you because she's someone that's hard to love. It would have been best to make her a temporary character like most others were, but they decided to keep her as recurring for whatever reason. However, her appearances are so few that it isn't that big of a deal.",

            "content": "With candy eyes, enticing looks, and empathetic speech, hosts would never fail to entertain their guests, just as the Ouran High School Host Club anime delights its out-numbering viewers and fans. From the mind of renowned manga-ka Hatori Bisco, Ouran High School Host Club is, simply said, an anime that many otakus, if not non-anime lovers, recommend to watch!\r\nFilled with a wide range of comedy, drama, and romance, Ouran High School Host Club is a story circling between a group of teens&mdash;something that many viewers, especially teens themselves, are fond of.  Though &ldquo;reverse harem&rdquo; is a common genre, there&rsquo;s a streak or two ofuniqueness that would often pop up in every episode of the anime. The story may sometimes, if not always, be a bit random, but later on new streams of events would begin to unfold. In a simple mindset a viewer may find the daily events of the characters&rsquo; lives ordinary, but in a closer perspective he can&rsquo;t always predict what would happen next! That&rsquo;s probably the &ldquo;basis&rdquo; of Ouran High School Host Club that makes fans stick to their seats and crave for more!\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art and music, I would say that Ouran High School Host Club would be among the &ldquo;better&rdquo; anime series. The art isn&rsquo;t really that perfect so I won&rsquo;t consider it as part of the best. But I have to say that the main attraction of the anime are the major characters, notably some strikingly beautiful guys and a uniquely attractive chick! They themselves do not revolve around a simple plot since each of them has a story to tell, an ideal approach to understand why such characters act as they do.  The music or sound, on the other hand, obviously suits the mood being set in a given situation&mdash;be it a hilarious slapstick (or a witty joke) or a heartrending scene&mdash;whatever &ldquo;emotion&rdquo; the story suggests would be further emphasized by the music. I have to say though that it has a &quot;classical&quot; touch to it. xD\\n\\n\r\nIn a sense of &ldquo;fangirl-ism,&rdquo; I say Ouran High School Host Club is a must-watch!",

OHSHC will keep you laughing for hours on end with its beautiful artwork and hilarious characters combined to create loveable and euphoric adventures with its characters. I like this anime because of its original and entirely unique humor that no anime that I\\'ve seen can compare to. Once again, a MUST Watch, It\\'s friggin\\' hilarious for god sakes! When told to imagine someone perfectly, one character goes and imagines a mannequin to be his crush,causing him to kiss it, and to be walked in on the very person he was imagining it to be! One hilarious quote: &quot;You two can be the homo characters!&quot;. Just watch the anime, I guarantee that you\\'ll enjoy it to the very end.",

            "content": "Hmm well, to start off, Ouran Highschool Host Club is so far the best anime I've ever watched, and manga I've ever read. \r\nStory:\r\nOkay, I gave the story a nine because yes, I DO think it is pretty original and all, but I just bought 'Hana Kimi' today and I find the two concepts a lot alike. (Except in Hana Kimi  no one knows she's a girl)\r\nHonestly, I found out about this anime because I saw an AMV with it and it looked really hilarious. \r\nArt:\r\nSimply amazing. In all the animes I've seen, I've never seen such pretty art. Yes, I mean pretty. Theymake their boys look so princely, and the girls so soft! Everything so...well....fancy! I guess that's what they get though, for going to an upper high class institute hah xD Honestly, I've never seen a style come close to this. The backrounds are just amazing. When they show you the whole school, it really takes my breath away! It has really inspired me so much in my drawings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nI find all of the characters extremely unique. Each of their life stories are so interesting, and sometimes tragic. Honestly, I don't know how anyone could forget any of the Host Club members' names. The thing is, even the twins who are practicaly the same, are so different at the same time. Even if you think the characters are bad at the beggining, they eventually grow on you. For example, I really really hated Tamaki when I started the seriese, yet now he is my third favourite character! All of them are really funny,in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nSeriously, I have never laughed so hard while watching anime. Bisco Hatori, the maker, must be like, a master mind comedian in disguise or something...\\n\r\nThis show is really moving too, sometimes just the things they say, the situations, and relations. You could watch this anime over and over again without getting tired of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, as I said earlier, this is the best anime I've ever watched. Its combinations of Romance, Comedy, School, and Drama is simply amazing.This is deffinatly an anime everyone one should watch, and I think most people regardless of gender would like.\\n",

            "content": "I have to admit: I watched this when I was first getting into anime and when I read the plot I thought \"OMG, American teen movie all the way\"\r\nThen I did not know that Japan manages to make amazing plots that sound familiar and predictable and turn them into something unique and marvelous. Again: kudos to these people and their amazing talent!\r\nSTORY:(8) seriously, it sounds ridiculous and like something that you'll probably know what will happen next.The truth is it surprised me 'cause this baby is full of surprises, good surprises, the story takes many turns to things you wouldn't have imagined. But the realenjoyment is in the the comedy,  the comedy in this show is what really makes it so good. I mean, the times I laughed my ass off while watching this, literally falling off my chair and screw the language barrier, this show is funny as hell! The situations these people get into and the way they handle it is just hilarious. If you don't get a great laugh out of this, man you must be one messed up person.There isn't much romance going on, maybe in the manga it does but the series has very little to none at all so if you're hesitating than please, do not, this is not your typical shoujo.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:(9)\\n\r\nthe art? beautiful .Crisp and clean and I really like the character drawings even though you got your typical cute guys running all around, yet they all have their own unique style that makes them stand out from the rest and each other. You don't have a bunch of all look the same dudes here, much like their characters the art is very unique and quite pretty to look at. The school is beautiful drawn as in most of the background and the clothes also are fun to watch since they got this like different occasion dress style going.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:(7) now I'm gonna be frank with you,I haven't seen this in awhile but since I don't remember the ost much it probably don't have much to say. The OP is fun, your typical stupid pop song that get's stuck in your had everytime you hear and the ED is nice too...nothing to spectacular though.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:(9)\\n\r\nNow the characters are really something. Tamaki especially, you just can't not love this dork, he is by far one of the most funniest characters I've come across. He has all the downsides of a human being(selfish, spoiled, arrogant, terribly narcissistic)and yet you still love him 'cause in the end he's just human and he's a ditzy but that's part of his charm. But still he is a quite enjoyable one to watch and his \"depression\" mode is of the most funny parts in the show. Then the other guys are equally as enjoyable, the twins are just amazing, Honey is the cutest and most fierce little creature out there, Takashi is the only sane person in the bunch aside from Haruhi and Kyouya...well, I didn't like him that much, but even so he's still unique. The cute thing and the most enjoyably is that this group is one with friends who all are completely different from one another.It's like they complete in one another what one lacks and in the end that's what relationships are all about anyway. Then we come to Haruhi, Haruhi is amazing, she is really one to enjoy, her wit is beyond me and it's a nice breeze to see an intelligent woman(even though she pretends to be a man) in the anime industry other than the ditzy,high pitch voiced ones who only care about guys. She is a bit ditzy actually but her ditziness is likable and (dare I say) witty.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL:(9)/(8)\\n\r\nI was aiming for a 9 but the ending sucks so I dropped to 8. Of course the usual endings that animes that finish before the manga find of this genre met this series and decided to stay. The end could have been better done, it really ruins the whole series.\\n\r\nOther than that, this show is very enjoyable and one of my favs. There's no way you won't love the characters and laugh with their amazing pranks. The story is well executed and beautifully written,happy surprises arise here and there. I general I enjoyed this show completely, it's pleasant to watch and smart enough to make you pay your respects to it's awesomeness.Tons of laughs, maybe a few tears if you're the sappy type( I'm not, can't ever cry over these things) and endearing and approachable characters. This series is a definitely must for those in for a good time.",

We have upbeat, bland music playing at the most unfitting times. And also, this anime is just trying to shove the \"emotions\" down your throat. It's like the violin is trying to hunt you down and kill you. Every second of this anime is absolutely cringe-worthy. We have stereotypical characters there for the \"love drop.\" We have the bland, composed guy, the money bags, twins with the characteristics of sandpaper, and some other useless side characters. Did I mention the one that's therefor yaoi? Oh wait, that's every single one of them. The anime  tries to set up some \"heart-breaking\" story about loss and new family found in friendship. It tries to make characters parental figures without any subtlety at all. It fails miserably at all of that. While it seemed like it had potential, every episode is bombarded with fan-service.  Absolutely horrific anime. Would not recommend to  anybody.",

            "content": "Story: Ouran's storyline is surprisingly unique. It manages to poke fun at typical shoujo \"cliches,\" yet still take itself seriously in places. Most episodes are stand-alone which would allow the viewer to watch any random episode and still get the general idea of the series. \r\nArt: Typical of shoujo art, the characters are undeniably cute-looking, each with their own distinct style unless intended otherwise (the twins, for example). The scenery is beautiful as well, with a happy, bright atmosphere throughout.\r\nSound: Ouran is accompanied by a charming soundtrack, full of mostly classical style music that perfectly matches the show's setting and fun themes. The voice actorseach portray their roles marvelously, as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: One of Ouran's strong points is its unique characters (and development thereof). No one person is the same; each has his or her own quirks and aspirations which make them all likeable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: My highest individual score; Ouran is a fun ride the whole way through. Besides the interesting character development, it's chock-full of humor, and it's good humor; I was a victim of side-splitting laughter more times than I could count. (Yes, this is a good thing.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: You should check into Ouran no matter who you are. If you love shoujo, you'll love it. If you don't love shoujo, you'll still love it because it's not afraid to make fun of itself. (And if you're like me and don't really care about demographics, yes, you'll love it, too.)",

            "content": "Well I'm probably not the first guy to review this show, and for the sake of my masculinity I liked it a lot more than I should have. But as soon as the pink flowery reverse harem show brings in a self aware, character-based plot that subverts anime tropes like twins and secret techniques AND is funny; you have me hooked. Seriously I loved this show, and the self-aware humor works all because of Haruhi. This is the key part of why Ouran is so good, is because it stays funny throughout because of its distinct and absurd cast of boys seen through Haruhi's \"commoner\"eyes. It's like satire without the bite, and the social commentary based humor is similar to stuff like The Importance of Being Earnest or some of Shakespeare's work. The plot of the whole show is episodic (which if you've seen my reviews there are exceptions, but on the whole I don't care for episodic anime) and with each episode reveals new plots where the lads of the show express their more ridiculous characteristics to \"make all girls happy\", and as the show goes on their backstories are revealed and their personalities even bloom more. So each of the show's episodes are all so good because of the humor that these distinct and hilarious characters show, but towards the end of the show, you start to see a theme of commentary about social pressure, and that not only makes the show funnier, but plays on why the characters are the way they are. The only issues I had with the show is that the humor is a little repetitive and the plot is a little unfocused. After a while, the formula of the twins romantically looking at each other's eyes, Haruhi getting annoyed, and Tamaki freaking out and hiding in a corner is funny, but dulls toward the end. I was also a little frustrated that there wasn't more of a focus or drive for Haruhi to stay in the club, and other than the initially incident, the broken vase only gets discussed when it gets resolved, when I feel like it should have been more of her drive for being there. I feel it would have worked in the show's favore if she discovered she could bond with the guys because they're hilarious and gradually forget about the vase. But despite the focus going everywhere, this is still a great light and hilarious show sprinkled with social commentary, and laden with transvestite, moe, and incest jokes to boot.",

I only picked it back up because my friends said that it was similar to the animes I have watched, which I never really found any similarities between this anime and the anime I enjoyed watching. The story in the beginning never really got my attention to keep watching. The mid point was where it got interesting, especially when we were shown how the Host Club got together. \r\n[ART]\r\n-----------\r\nI didn't really enjoy the quality of this anime. I don't really enjoy anime that seems like its from the 2000s-2008s, because the quality is justvery unclear. Even so, the scenery was very good.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI got a lot of positive reviews to watch the dubbed version instead of the subbed, so I watched the dubbed. The voice actors / actresses did an amazing job expressing their characters, especially Fujioka. I never watched the subbed version, and I don't think I will ever plan to. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI actually really liked some of the characters. More specifically, Suou, the Hitachiin twins, Haninozuka, and Ootori. The other characters were not that interesting, although Fujioka had a very mysterious personality. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nAgain, I've dropped this anime so many times that I never thought I'd finish. The ending was average, but I really enjoyed the scenes in the middle of the anime. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nPeople say this anime is like Kaichou wa Maid-sama!, which I don't really find what they see similar between them two. Sure the main characters may look the same, but their personality is like the complete opposite, but overall, this anime was average. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: \\n\r\n7/10",

I really was wrong. This is coming from a Death Note, FMA Brotherhood type anime fan. From now on i will refer to the anime as \"Ouran\" \r\nSTORY\r\nOuran is about a girl who dresses like a boy named Haruhi Fujioka, an honor student, who ends going to Ouran HS, a school for the super rich and beautiful. Being a commoner, this experience is obviously awkward. Looking for a quiet place to study, Haruhi opens the door of an abandoned music roomand finds the Host Club, which is pretty much a group of really hot guys at the school with too much time on their hands, entertaining rich girls who also have way too much time on their hands. Anyways, with her encounter came the breaking of something super expensive, she owes 8 millon yen to the host club, and since she doesn't have any money, she is, evenually, forced to become a host herself to pay her debt.\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the series, (no spoilers,) there are several mininplots, along with many episodes that show almost all of the important character's backstories. Not just main characterers, but the pasts ofimportant side characters as well. Since almost every single character is rich in this series and most reading this review aren't, I'll say that it was extremely interesting to see the struggles within families of the rich. I have a friend that told me that there's too much comedy, even in serious moments; I'm inclined to dissagree. I'll have to compare this to Black Butler, which had a huge problem when it came to humor. In very serious moments, everything was broken with a joke. Ouran knows hoe to execute himor correctly in dark times, which is an amazing feat you won't see in many anime. Besides, Ouran is a comedy.\\n\r\nNow for the SHOJOU STEREOTYPES...\\n\r\nThe boys in the host club are definitely shojou stereotypes, (fanservice, perfect looks, etc.) The way it's presented, however, gives Ouran an advantage. There are several instances where the anime was MAKING FUN OF THE SHOJOU GENRE, which was hilarious. Plus, the fanservice actually CONTRIBUTES TO THE ANIME! A perfect example is the Hitachiin twins, (you'll see what i mean.)\\n\r\nCHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:\\n\r\nOuran's greatest asset. In 26 episodes, the writers managed to make the development realistic and influental on the watcher. I actually learned a few lessons with the characters from Ouran. Pretty much all the chatacters developed, with one exception in the Host Club.\\n\r\nThere are sooo many other good things about the story and characters, but I'll leave that for you to figure out.\\n\r\nANIMATION and SOUND\\n\r\nFitting for the genre of the anime. Cartoony, chibi versions of the characters all the time, and in my opinion, the outside design for the highschool building is really beautiful. There was nothing AMAZINGGG though.\\n\r\nI watched the english dub, which was SPECTACULAR. Nothing less than what I expected from Funimation\\n\r\nKiss kiss, fall in love!\\n\r\nAll in all, OURAN IS AMAZING!\\n",

            "content": "When I first watched Ouran High School Host Club, I felt a warmth in my heart that turned me into a squealing, obsessed fan-girl in less than twenty-four hours. Since Ouran was my first Shoujo anime, so to speak, I fell in love with it. And what lonely, crazy, sophomore in high school wouldn't love a group of sparkling men that treated girls with care and respect, even if the acts were a bit scandalous? Certainly I was no exception to this fan-girl-ism. Still, even from the first travel into Ouran, I knew that the series wasn't worthy of a ten.\r\nOuran High School Host Clubhad it's moments of wonder and great ideas to spark them. A great example of this wonder is the story. Not only was the story easy to follow, but the characters all were given believable and well-built backgrounds that really help people understand and connect with them, even if the backgrounds weren't really shown until the end of the series. Plot lines, from characters to overall story, were very well developed and really pushed the story through until the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnother fantastic example of the wonder of Ouran is the music. Through the entire series, music played a very important role in setting the mood for the scene. Weather it was a small conversation with the hosts, or a huge, dramatic scene between an antagonist and a protagonist, the music brought out every scene beautifully and pulled off being one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in the entertainment industry.\\n\\n\r\nWith Ouran's greatness, however, the series did have it's flaws, even if the flaws were so small they could be overlooked the first time around. Art is a great example of a flaw that can be overlooked. The first time around, I didn't really notice anything about the art I didn't like. In fact, I thought the art brought out a lot of characters, especially the flowers around Honey and the expressions that Tamaki gave. The second time I watched, however, I was concerned about the colors of the school. I realize that Ouran is a Shoujo, but having an all pink room with a lavender outside and clock tower is a bit ridiculous, even for something as \"girly\" as Ouran High School Host Club.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing about Ouran, sad to say, is actually the characters. The first time around, I would've told you that the characters are great and everything about them is wonderful, but that's not the case anymore. First, I want to point out Tamaki, the prince, so to speak. Tamaki Suou seems like an appealing character, with the fan-girls and the following, but he comes across as a male Mary-Sue, other wise known as a Gary-Stu. He's second in his class, scores all the ladies, and most of his flaws are \"cute\". The climax of the story has one flaw blown to an extreme.\\n\\n\r\nAnother character is Honey, who looks like he's in grade school, even though he's eighteen, yet if he fights to his fullest potential, other countries would believe that Japan had some sort of new nuclear weapon or something like that. He's very smart, cute, scores girls, can fight, and, like Tamaki, most of his flaws are \"cute\". His character isn't realistic at all, and leaves me wondering if anyone would really be attracted to someone like that.\\n\\n\r\nReally, Ouran High School Host Club could be enjoyed by a lot of people, but I would save it for girls that love an anime for the characters and cuteness. Even I go back and re-watch episodes on occasion, when I feel lonely or just want to watch something cute without devoting myself to a different Shoujo that I'm unsure about. In the end, I would say that Ouran shouldn't be as popular as it is, but I can see why it's popular - girls love it, and I can't blame them.",

I dont remember much about this series because i watched it years ago but i dont really give a fuck.\r\nThis show was in held in such high regard and coming straight off my first love of a romcom anime in toradora, i was itching for more. The  show had a great pre-text and potential for entertainment but alas, i could not enjoy it as it is CLEARLY intended for pubescent girls. \r\nBasically this girl does her best amanda bynes impression by attending a boys school andall the boys are total hotties and she eventually has feelings for one and then some carriage/ maze thing?? and they live happily ever after. She samples each guy, as if she was tasting her favourite cheese, as each has their own charm/ appeal. Gouda comes in the form of the strereotypical hot guy which is rich and a big penis aka channing \"not jonah hill\" tatum\"\\n\\n\r\nThe story, art and characters really werent bad. i just couldnt appreciate them as the target audience is clearly intended to be highschool girls experimenting with their first crushes, periods and how many cucumbers they can steal from their parents refrigerator wihtout their mothers noticing. For a porn obsessed 14 year old interested in cars, sports and video games, this was not an enjoyable experience. i still watched all of it.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, im complaining that a womans size 2 dress isnt suitable for my purpose as a parachute. I just wish somebody would have told 14 year old me that this show is clearly for girls so i wouldnt have to sit through 26 episodes of a girls show and consequently give it a horrible rating when i could have spent that time stroking my snake. \\n\r\nTHIS SHOW IS FOR GIRLS.

            "content": "I\u2019ll admit, when I first started watching Ouran Highschool Host Club, I wasn\u2019t sure how much it would really stick with me once it was over. Oh, I knew I would enjoy it immensely, but would a silly show about silly boys being silly really have all that much meat for me to chew on? Honestly, I thought this would just be a fun distraction on the way to meatier, more substantial shows on my watchlist.\r\nReaders, I have never been so happy to be wrong in my life.\r\nMake no mistake, Ouran is a very silly show, and it embraces that fact. The comedy is zany,constant, and constantly top-notch, throwing together an eclectic bunch of personalities with a wide variety of stylistic flourishes and a straight-up fantastic English dub. Honestly, the spectacle of watching Vic Mignogna and J Michael Tatum call each other Mommy and Daddy would be enough to make this show one of my favorites by itself. And Ouran didn\u2019t really need to be more than that.\\n\\n\r\nBut it was more. It went the extra mile and decided to be about something.\\n\\n\r\nOuran Highschool Host Club is a show about the need to be your own person, even if society is telling you you can\u2019t. The members of the titular host club are all trapped in some way: by family legacies, birthright responsibilities, and self-imposed isolation. It\u2019s only through their time at the host club that they\u2019re able to come out of their shells and become the people they\u2019ve always wanted to be. Yes, they fit into stereotypes that would feel right at home in a million derivative Shojo stories- the flamboyant prince type, the boy lolita-, but only because those personas are natural extensions of who they already are. Those silly, goofy, indulgent times in the host club were far more real than the perfect sons and perfect heirs they were marked to be from birth.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s the club's newest member: Haruhi, the one person with perhaps the biggest eye for bullshit among them all. Through their interactions with her, the boys are able to find someone who truly sees them for who they are and accepts them just as that. She is the presence that turns the club into a true family, even as they in turn help her realize and overcome her own limitations. As voiced by the ever-wonderful Caitlin Glass (and hey, we got a Winry Rockbell/Edward Elric shipping reunion! Hooray!), her deadpan snark belies powerful hidden depths, and her journey to self-acceptance formed the emotional center around which everything else rotated. Haruhi is a fantastic protagonist, and the way her psyche was explored in the Wonderland episode is going to stick with me for years to come.\\n\\n\r\nI could nitpick some small flaws- some jokes got a little repetitive, there were some potentially uncomfortable aspects with the way the show treated Haruhi\u2019s dad- but in the end, they don\u2019t matter that much. Ouran Highschool Host Club was delightful from start to finish, a fantastic comedy with an even more fantastic heart. If you haven't seen it yet, now's the time to fix that.\\n\\n\r\nOh, also, Sakura Kiss is a fucking TUNE.",

I think the best way to describe this anime is bubbly, humorous, and off-the-top adorable. Although this is not necessarily intended to be suspenseful, the very first episode has the viewer pulled in and left waiting to see what events unfold for the mysterious scholarship student. I will admit the plot line is far from boring and the characters make you want to root for them. However, if it wasn't for the diversity in the host club's' personalities the plot line wouldn't havestood a chance at being this successful. Each character did a phenomenal job at portraying a different personality extreme and for that you really see how the characters develop and change throughout the course of the show. Honestly, how many other animes have twins with homosexual tendencies? Not many, and that is just another reason why Ouran High School Host Club surprises you with it's originality and specific situations in each proceeding episode.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime and I highly recommend an open mind (due to suggestive themes) while watching.\\n",

            "content": "Story: 8\r\nThis is the weakest point of the show, not that it's bad, but because it really isn't centered on it. When it is put front and center it almost feels like filler after watching 17 episodes of solid laughs. The plot nevertheless is carried out beautifully and helps you feel a personal connection to each of the characters.\r\nArt: 8\r\nThis show probably has some of the best drawing I have ever seen. The movements of the characters are very fluid and... uh... beautiful, considering their men and, uh, yeah... The backgrounds are well drawn, not really spectacular but after all, it's a PINK highschool. Ido appreciate how they centered more attention on the character animation and there are next to no still screens.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe voice acting was frankly perfect. All the characters were well matched with their actors in the dub (and what I've heard of the sub is really amazing too).  Almost the entire English cast if from Fullmetal Alchemist, which can be very disconcerting.  The background music is classical and light hearted, but when needed there are some great drama pieces.  I personally like the intro song, it fits the anime well in my opinion, and it's very catchy, so catchy I sang it accidently, in public, in a supermarket.  My sister wouldn't acknowledge me for a while after that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThis show does good where it counts. Everyone who views this will probably have at least one of the hosts on their favourites list. Each host represents a highschool stereotype but stretch beyond it each in their own way.  My personal favourites are Haruhi Fujioka and Tamaki Suoh.  Haruhi is serious and NOTHING phases her, really nothing.  Tamaki is hilarious and is frequently at the brunt end of jokes. Outside of the hosts the secondary characters are fairly well done, even the Lobelia girls despite the fact that I greatly dislike them, you might even be able to say that I HATE them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis is an excellent shoujo, and it is probably the most shoujo anime I have ever seen, or will see. Guys may feel a bit intimidated about watching it and might not make it past the intro. (Hint: Roses, so many roses!) However it is so very worth your while if you give it a chance. Ouran High School Host Club is available for legal viewing at youtube.com/shows and dvds are sold in America.\\n\\n\r\nParent's Caution:\\n\r\nThis show is for teens as it has copious amounts of fanservice, though largely without immodesty and most of the fanservice is shirtless men... if that is any consolation.\\n\r\n-There is implied homosexuality, but it is merely for the entertainment of the female patrons of the club, again if that is any consolation.\\n\r\n-Also there are lesbians and crossdressers, both used for comedic reasons.\\n\r\n-There is little to no swearing and no sex scenes (I promise there's none no matter how many times you think there will be.)\\n\r\n-The comedy never stoops to crude and this show is far more appropriate then the vast majority of teen dramas and comedies State-side.",

Ouran High School Host Club... it's about 1 o'clock in the morning and I just finished it and I couldn't be happier.\r\nThe Story \r\nThe story didn't have really a beginning and an end as much as it had a pattern that slowly moved the series forward (as much as it repeats, it does move forward).  I grew to love the pattern, seeing the new outfits, how much trouble the Host Club would cause for Haruhi, and what lesson everyone would learn fromthe dim witted but laughably noble and kind hearted Tamaki (who has now become one of my all time favorite characters!).  Also, the ending was almost perfect, they had me wondering how it would end a few times, but they did not disappoint me like so many other animes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art\\n\r\nThe art wasn't supper amazing, but it fit this particular anime's personality well.  The show has some serious under tones, but is mostly fun and games.  The art reflected that by staying clean (clean in a sense of minimal details) and modest (especially for a romance genre).  But there were also times when more detailing was used, which I felt were appropriate and did not take away from what was happening.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound\\n\r\nI'm not all together sure why they have a sound section... I guess some anime's might have particularly fun music worth commenting on but, any how... I guess now that I think about it there are some things to write about.  The opening song is really catchy, and it helps that the chorus is english... you'll be getting it stuck in your head a lot.  AND, Tamaki plays the piano exquisitely *fan girl drools* I love a guy that's musically inclined :-)\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters \\n\r\nIf I could have a reverse harem, it would have every member of the Host Club in it :-}  Like I said, Tamaki was really entertaining, he was probably drawn in some comical way (like the sad lookin guys with the circles for eyes and no coloring) more often then not.  I also really liked Honey, he was really cute.  This anime also took good care to fully explain all the major characters, at times this part was kind of depressing, especially the twins, but it just helped add to the finale.  Also, once you start watching you may notice all the different groups of people with ambiguous sexual orientations... that part of the show surprised me a little.  It was pretty adult content for what seemed to be a younger age anime... but hey I could be wrong.  I thought it was interesting how they explored the idea of how gender shouldn't make a difference in how you live you life and treat others.  Even though they conveyed it with semi-adult content, they got a across a pretty fundamental life lesson.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment!!\\n\r\nOuran High School Host Club gets a 10/10 for enjoyment!  I was laughing the entire time.  There was a serious story going on with life lessons being learned and all but mostly it was just screamingly funny!  I'm used to watching shounen type animes with lots of action, and blood, and really thick tragic drama.  This was a really good change of pace for me and I am happy to say that I have successfully broadened my taste in anime because of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Ouran gets a 10/10, there were some parts that might have been improved upon but only just a little, in fact I may not have liked it so much if they'd changed anything about it.  I highly recommend you watch this anime, it's funny and cute and heart warming.  GO... WATCH!\\n\\n\r\nKP",

            "content": "Ouran high school host club is very much a shojo slice of life anime. Haruhi Fujioka is a schlorship student at a very prestigious school. After a uniform mix up she has to wear the boys uniform on her first day. She stumbles upon the Ouran academy\u2019s host club. Where charming young men dazzle young ladies. Haruhi accidentally knocks over an extremely valuable vase that was meant to be auctioned off. As haruhi has no way of repaying the vase the host club \u201cemploys\u201d her thinking she is male as a host. She is very good at being a host as she is able torelate to the girls. Each member of the host club gradually discovers she is a girl and they help her keep it a secret (so she can continue to work at the host club and pay off her debt).\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has so many cute and funny moments. It is a well loved anime for good reason. Great characters, great humour, average story. Okay so it isn\u2019t that original the whole \u201cgirl surrounded by a heap of guys and she has to try to not be discovered\u201d. There are quite a few similar story lines out there. The thing that is great about Ouran high school host club is that it is very approachable. You don\u2019t need really any prior knowledge to anime or anything to understand it. It is one of those anime that introduces a lot of people to anime. I think it is overall a fun anime. There is a very big following and their is so many different \u201cshipping\u201d of the characters. It is definitely romance based without being direct about it. It doesn\u2019t really make a lot of sense but if you watch it you will understand what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great and I love Haruhi. She is a great female protagonist and she is very strong and independent. The guys are sometimes over protective and it is super cute. This anime is another one that is over the top exaggerated and generally is random. To sum up Ouran high school host club I would say cute. It is funny and despite not having a very good over arcing plot each episode has a nice pace. I would recommend this anime to you if it sounds like something you would be interested in.",

            "content": "I didn't plan to watch this ever because the art seemed so unappealing and it's so very popular therefore I was sure I would hate it. It's one of my favourite shows now.\r\nStory 10/10: It doesn't really have an overarching plot line, and it is very much episodic, which is a setup I  tend to struggle with, but here it works so well, as thanks to the different situations the characters are thrown in each episode, they have ample time and space to be fleshed out and to grow. \r\nArt 10/10: It doesn't look as good as some new shows but honestly the artstyle and colours especially really worked in the show's favour, contributing to the very light hearted atmosphere. The animation was very fluid, and there was some outstanding moments, such as playing with the lighting to show a particular character's feelings and such things. Overall I found no glaring issues in this department.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: The opening is a classic, you can't help but love it, but I didn't much care for the ending theme, unfortunately. I really liked the background music though, it is quite exaggerated sometimes and uses a lot of violin and piano, which really contributes to the atmosphere of the show. The voice acting however, is outstanding, from the main characters to the side characters, and especially during the gag scenes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Apart from the comedy, this show's strength lies in its characters. Everyone in the main cast is initially set up to be the representation of a stereotype, but then the show goes on and focuses on each of them, and basically flips the stereotypes on their heads. It's really quite amazing how much of a difference there is between their personalities and their relationships in the first episode and in the last episode. There are quite a lot of side-characters introduced but somehow it never feels like the show focuses too much on them, actually it's more like the main cast is developed through  their interactions with the side characters. The characters really exceeded my expectations, as I was sure I would hate some of them before I watched it, but now the entire main cast has found a special place on my list of favourite characters ever.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: I have a love-hate relationship with comedy series that are episodic, because the jokes rarely work on me, but here they worked too well. There wasn't a single episode apart from the more serious ones that didn't make me laugh out loud at least four times, which never happens. There was this particular episode that had the banana gag like 7 times and it still managed to be funny every time. I have no idea how they did it, but this is how comedy should be done. And even though it is episodic, that didn't stop me from binging it in three days, which, again, never happens with such shows. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: It is over-the-top and ridiculous, but one of the most fun anime I've ever had the pleasure of watching, and I wouldn't want anyone to miss out on that. I wouldn't exactly recommend this if you're searching for a great romance though, the manga does a lot better in that department.",

            "content": "Oh boy this show was an experience.  It in many ways is awful and yet it keeps you engaged because of how purely enjoyable it is.  There are many hilarious lines, outrages scenes, and overall it\u2019s a ride. I watched the entire anime in a two day span and loved it.  It\u2019s hard to tell if this show is amazingly woke or boarderline offensive, but regardless it\u2019s an experience. I\u2019ll go through each eating and explain them down below:\r\nStory 3: Perhaps giving the story a three is being too harsh.  The storyline isn\u2019t all that great if you looked at itfrom a far. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s an awful storyline because it was indeed enjoyable to follow, but the development and plot of the anime was pretty poor.\\n\r\nArt 5: The art style is pretty dated.  It\u2019s not bad for the time period it\u2019s coming for and I don\u2019t mind its stylistic choices, but it\u2019s definitely dated.  Overall though, I think it works for the anime. \\n\r\nSound 7: I\u2019ve seen it both subbed and dubbed and in both cases the voice acting was good.  I\u2019m not normally a big dubbed fan, but they got some good actors to come in and the performances were nice. \\n\r\nCharacter 5 (nope 6): I\u2019m a bit sad giving this one a 5.  I love the characters, but most of them are relatively insane and off the wall.  However, with that said, the anime did do a great job developing their characters.  You know what, never mind I\u2019m changing this score to a 6 now that I think of the care the creators took in character development. \\n\r\nEnjoyability 10: This was the easiest score to give.  Thanks to all the problems in the storyline and awkwardness and ridiculousness, this show is hilarious and very enjoyable to watch. \\n\r\nOverall 9; I\u2019m not giving it a 9 overall because the anime is great, I\u2019m giving it a 9 because the experience is great. \\n",

            "content": "'Ouran High School Host Club' is definitely more than meets the eye. Yes, all of the characters are designated some sort of a stereotype that they live up to, but the situations they are forced into satirises the many stereotypes and tropes that plague many rom-com, slice-of-life shoujo animes. (+2 for cutting edge satire and a witty delivery).\r\nStory:\r\nThe plot of Ouran, itself, is pretty much absent and the show relies heavily on problem-of-the-week scenarios which are funny - at first - but do eventually become tiresome (-1 for lack of proper plot progression). But the shows real charm isn't its plot - or lack of- its the manner in which it's executed that makes it so charming: the scenarios are often mocking the moe and fangirl aspects of shoujo. (+2 for saving a dismal plot with wit and sarcasm). The show doesn't seem to suffer much from bad pacing, except in the last two episodes where we don't get some sort of a plot; however, everything felt a little bit rushed and muddled (-1 for making me confused) and the ending did fall into that shoujo trope of leaving the viewer quite disappointed (-1). Nonetheless, poking fun at the typical fairy-tale endings of shoujo (by having Haruhi dancing around with her harem of men) was pretty funny (+1). Furthermore, despite its Harem setting, Haruhi never finds herself being torn between multiple guys! (+1)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOuran's heroine, Haruhi, is presented as an intelligent girl who doesn't care about gender confinements or her looks. The most important part of her character is that she's intelligent - unlike most Shoujos, Haruhi is not only said to be smart, but she actually IS smart (+1). Its great to see her break the fourth wall and make some snarky remark about the other characters (especially when it comes to Tamaki). She's witty, sharp and snarky and I just LOVE her (+1).\\n\\n\r\nThe members of the Host Club are, unfortunately, not as appealing to me as Haruhi.  Half of them fail to do much outside of the stereotype that they are assigned to - which is where the anime falls flat (-1). Tamaki is funny, but that's about it. I didn't really feel much from him, and the sob story near the end didn't convince me. He was just your typical shoujo 'Prince'. Honey-senpai (and the irrelevant mute: Mori-senpai) was really annoying; I can't stand loli-shota characters, and Honey reminded me why: they're so babyish and never care about anything except the things that please them. I think the anime would have been better without such a character (-1). However, the Hitachiin twins - who are initially presented as two incestous brothers - do well to work out of their stereotype. Despite looking the same, the two have very different personalities: Kaouru is the wise and kind one, whilst Hikaru is the rash and rebellious one. Their development was probably the most surprising, and I think that they two ended up growing the most out of all of the Host Club members (sans Haruhi) (+2 for development and variety). Of course, I have to mention Ootori Kyouya - who has become one of my favourite male characters. The guy is just so calm, calculative and cunning. Perceptive and evil without remorse: he's always one step ahead of everybody else (+1). His humour his dry, but always manages to burn (+1) and he never tries to make himself appear as anything other than a pragmatic, money-loving genius (+1). That being said, he does have his flaws: his sob story is boring and I have absolutely no sympathy with him being the third son and having to \"live up\" to so much. His sense of entitlement does bother me, and he could do without some of his snobbiness (-1). \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the art Ouran is ugly to me. The colouring is pretty, but the actual aesthetics of the characters are bleh. Everybody seems to have really long limbs and huge hands, and their heads never seem to match their bodies. I didn't find the art attractive at all (-2). \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the animators did a good job at conveying the expressions of the characters which went well with the scenarios and feelings the characters were dealing with. Even the stoic Mori got a chance to show some facial variety (+1).\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus did their jobs really well! Although I watch anime with subs, I felt the changes in pitch and phrasing depending on the emotions that were being presented at the time. (+1). The use of classical music was nice, too, and I feel that it complemented the high-class setting of Ouran very well. However, the repetitive use of some pieces became quite annoying so the overall sound gets a (0) from me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall and enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nDespite its many flaws, I did really enjoy Ouran. It was a great piece of entertainment and is a perfect light-watch. There's drama, but its nothing too intense (especially after having binge-watched both seasons of Psycho-Pass prior to watching Ouran). The humour is the heart of this show: I don't think there are many shoujos that are as satirical as Ouran. I love satire, and I especially loved the constant mocking of moe, otakus, otomes, fangirls and shoujo tropes.  (+1 for enjoyment and humour). Therefore, I recommend Ouran to those who are like for an entertaining watch that also offers a refreshing take on the shoujo genre.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 7/10.",

            "content": "I had a lot of fun with this show, that is all I could simply say. This show had been enjoyable and... holy shit it's 4:23 am I'm tired as shit fuck this formal bullshit this show was great. This show had gone deeper into the plot in more ways I had expected. And to finally see this show ending, it's almost painful. It's as painful and grueling like a daughter marrying another man, as Tamaki might say.\r\nThis show is really playful and jokes around a lot, but at the same time incorporated deeper aspects to it. It feels like it can juggle all thataround almost perfectly. It felt like there was a very nice balance, and it had executed the show perfectly. You know what you're going to get and it executes and delivers perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe way this show executed their actions, the way the plot had dove into the characters more so than you could expect. I'd personally say on a 4:27 am ramble of anime talk that this was its strong point of this show. It wasn't the classic romcom that had this whole set-up of interesting characters, that all had interesting stories but never dove into it, leaving it as a generic surface potential of fat hump. It had a good set-up, a good plot, enjoyable and intriguing characters, a good development of the show and the characters, and shows you how everything got started from the beginning. Showing you that not every finished product doesn't have a story behind it. It's the story behind how the host club was made that is what makes the show unique and special.\\n\\n\r\nThis show had stayed consistent and fluid. They were very natural with their execution, like how it should be placed. Everything felt as though it happened for a good and logical reason that most everyone can agree with. Nothing seemed irrational or out of place. It seemed right, the characters stayed who they're supposed to be like as if they were real people, there was no fluctuation of irrational emotions without being explained as to why it happened. It all felt reasonable and within boundaries.\\n\\n\r\nDespite everything I had said, I want to point out the major flaw of this show. That is is that it lacks a focus, it feels as though there is no main story to this. It only gets fairly serious towards the end of the show, it feel more so like random painted colors that are enjoyed individually onto a big blank canvas. But when you take a step back, you realize that it's nothing much but pretty colors put together capriciously. However true it may be that the characters had much development, doesn't change the fact that this show had no focus and was very hard to put up with at some points. It was a simple and fun show that was meant to be taken without much thought or seriousness put into it. If you are looking for a show that is simple and enjoyable, this would definitely be something that you should watch. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I have to admit, shoujo anime  are something that I'm always very hesitant about, the fact that nowadays, they don't seem to have much original concepts, is only one of the many reason why I'm reluctant to place them carefully in my anime schedule.\r\nOuran was not one of those.\r\nIt's probably because I wasn't very knowledgeable on anime when I first watched Ouran High school Host Club. But it was also because I was drawn into something that I know people will find clich\u00e9 at first, but trust me dear, a few more episodes, and you'll find yourself crying silently alone at 4am in themorning. \\n\\n\r\nSo lets dig in.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOur story starts off with our dear Haruhi Fujioka, an innocent girl who just happens to be in a prestigious school called Ouran Academy. Basically somewhere rich people drop their rich kids off, and hope that they learn something. Haruhi is not the typical student, as she is a commoner, who has outstanding grades, and eventually got a scholarship. She stumbles upon an abandoned music room where she will eventually find people that she'll later on regret finding.\\n\\n\r\nAn idiot, 2 more idiots. The loli, quiet guy, and very, very manipulating douche.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is the part where she just so happens to break 3 million yen vase and very, very, manipulating douche, makes her pay off her debt by working for the host club.\\n\\n\r\nI also forgot to mention that she is in fact dressed as guy.\\n\\n\r\nI hate it. I hate how this show made me love these idiots. I hate how this show made me cry because of these idiots. And I hate that very, very manipulating douche, who made me not hate him.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is somewhat tragic, I know they are portrayed as rich and all, but the host club has people with different stories that the viewer might relate to. I found very, very manipulating douche's story similar to my own.\\n\\n\r\nI do find that around the end, the story makes up a last minutes plot twist, which I had expected. But I didn't care since the stories before the last minute twist had left me bawling my eyes out so really, I was still emotionally effected by the time the twist occurred.\\n\\n\r\nYou soon gradually love how the pieces form a puzzle for the host club, how the members were intertwined and how this one idiot made a club.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is hilarious, the characters are hilarious. Even I have to admit I had viewed this as a very easy-going show until it starts torturing my heart. You'll fail to pass it off as just another harem, because it isn't. If you need proof just look at all the damages to my heart and internal organs. \\n\\n\r\nIt's all their fault.\\n\\n\r\nI found the story enjoyable and heart-wrenching.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nRoses are flying everywhere. That is all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI was pleasantly surprised at the music, the nice, light, orchestral, classical music for the theme of the host club that you'll hear every once in a while is very relaxing. The theme song is just..\\n\\n\r\nMeh.\\n\\n\r\nI mean, it's not bad, it's just not good either. \\n\r\nI did watch the English Dub.\\n\\n\r\nEnglish Dubs are something I know a lot are reluctant about, but the casting is great. The voices fit perfectly. It's just perfect, I even liked Rengi's voice actor. It's great. I watched the sub, and to be honest, I find both good. It's up to personal preference, but for now, I recommend both really.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFind out for yourself. I'AM NOT WRITING SOMETHING THAT I KNOW IS GOING TO MAKE ME CRY, OKAY?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm just going to say that I found myself in a black hole once I finished. Desperately searching for a second season. I loved this anime, the character development is beautiful. You'll see what they've gone through in the past, and it's beautiful. It really is. Especially that manipulating douche's story (reason why I was found isolating myself for a week after an emotional breakdown at 4am)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy something that seemed ridiculous? Yeah\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy a lot of idiots doing idiotic things? Yeah\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy crying at 4am after watching this show? Yeah\\n\\n\r\nIs this show going to put you in an emotional mental state after you watch it?\\n\\n\r\nWell, yeah.\\n",

            "content": "\"The Ouran host club is where the school's handsomest boys with way too much time on their hands, entertain young ladies who also have way too much time on their hands. Just think of it as Ouran's elegant playground for the super rich and beautiful.\"-Tamaki Suoh\r\nThis show is just pure fun and nostalgia to me. It was one of the first anime I had watched. I remember when I only watched a few anime before this one. Examples being Fullmetal Alchemist, Fruits Basket, and Naruto. I have watched this anime multiple times and it still makes me rolling on the floor laughing. From the randomthings the characters would say, the quirky and wacky situations, and just the characters themselves. It's not just plain comedy, it does have its serious and dramatic moments. Don't go into this anime and expect tons of sad moments. These moments don't really happen that often and when they do, they're really short, but if you're wanting to have a good laugh and maybe with friends, this is the perfect show to check out. I really like good romantic comedy anime with good characters, so this was the perfect anime for me back then. I'll try to put my nostalgia aside and give it the proper review it deserves, now shall we get to the review?\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10 Standout(s) The wacky and funny situations\\n\\n\r\nIf you're expecting a deep and dramatic story, this isn't the best anime for you. In my opinion, you don't need a deep story to make a good show. Sometimes you just need good characters and fun situations for the characters to play off of. Does Ouran have those elements? Yes it does for me. I'll get to the characters later, for the funny moments they were hilarious. I was rolling on the floor laughing so hard. There was one time where we got to see Haruhi's dad, I won't tell you how it went but that was so out of place and comes out of nowhere that I just had to laugh. The drama was very effective and got you in the feels box. My only problem with the drama was that it didn't last that long, mostly 1-2 minutes. I'd love to see it go on for longer, maybe 7-8 minutes. Since we're talking about flaws, let's talk about the ending. It's one of those \"Go buy the manga to continue the story\" types of endings. Even though there were some touching moments in that end, I still didn't find the ending that satisfying. My last flaw was that it kind of have some cliches of shoujo anime. One being the main character's mom passing away. Well despite its flaws, I still enjoyed the story in OHSHC.\\n\\n\r\nPositives in the story: The balance of comedy and drama\\n\r\nNegatives in the story: The ending, shoujo cliches, and the dramatic moments not being long enough.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 10/10 Standout(s) The animation\\n\\n\r\nThis was done by Studio Bones, who also did Fullmetal Alchemist and Soul Eater. If you've seen those anime, you'd know how great the art and animation is. Just by looking at it, you could tell this was a shoujo anime. I love how vivid and elegant the art and animation was. It wasn't too bright and not too dark. It was just perfect for this anime. The character designs were very unique and had their own personality to them. You can tell the difference between characters by their body, hair, and faces. It wasn't that traditional same character with different color eyes and hair thing. The animation was used effectively. There was recycled animation in some scenes, like the Renge gangs. It was used as a gang, and it works really well for the show. Overall, great art and animation score.\\n\\n\r\nPositives in the Art and Animation: Vivid art, unique character designs, and beautiful animation.\\n\r\nNegatives in the Art and Animation: None\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 Standout(s) The dub\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\\n\r\nI loved the soundtrack a lot. I loved a lot of the violin pieces that were in the background. I thought they fitted in with the atmosphere and tone of the show. Before I move onto the opening, I want to give a shout out to the character themes. My personal favorite being Tamaki's theme. I thought it really fit his character and sounded very cute. Now let's talk about the opening.\\n\\n\r\nOpening:\\n\\n\r\nThe opening really fit the upbeat atmosphere the show gave off. I honestly loved the opening in Japanese. The English in my opinion, didn't really sound as good. The English version was okay, but it lacked the passion that Japanese version had.\\n\\n\r\nDub:\\n\\n\r\nSince this is a Funamtion dub, of course it's very well done. Since this show has a lot of Japanese culture in, it must have been hard for these actors to pronounce all these Japanese words. Not only did they get the pronunciation right, but they also fit the characters that they were given. My favorite, of course was Vic Mignogna as Tamaki. I think that this one of his best performances since Ed from FMA. He fit the weird and attractive guy that Tamaki was. Overall, excellent dub.\\n\\n\r\nPositives in the Sound: Elegant soundtrack, fun opening, and well acted dub.\\n\r\nNegatives in the Sound: The English version of the opening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10 Standout(s) The 7 main characters\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters were unique, complex, and had some development. Maybe after I'm done reading the manga, I'll review the rest of the characters. For now let's talk about Haruhi and Tamaki.\\n\\n\r\nHaruhi:\\n\\n\r\nHaruhi isn't just your typical love interest in a reverse harem. While most reverse harem anime have their main character very cute and kind, (Tohru Honda from Fruits Basket for example.) Haruhi is more independent, tomboyish, and keeps to herself then most other love interests. This makes her more unique and deeper then most other main love interests. She's in this kind of stage until we learn her back story and her fears. She fears being alone and lightning. This way, the audience gets a better understanding of her strengths and weaknesses. This also makes her more human and more understandable then most other characters in romantic comedy anime. Now for Tamaki.\\n\\n\r\nTamaki:\\n\\n\r\nHonestly my favorite character in the whole series. Tamaki may seem like the stereotypical rich guy and comic relief, but he has more of a heart then that. He's the \"king\" of the host club and is the fonder of it. He will help out anyone in need of it and will protect them from all harm. He also has a little bit of a sensitive side that he normally doesn't show. He hides his emotions by being happy and positive about things. He will be serious when the time is right. To me, Tamaki is the \"prince charming\" of anime. His life goal is to make everyone happy and he puts others before himself. He definitely had the development he needed and the perfect personality. Definitely a brilliant character that added a lot to the show and manga.\\n\\n\r\nPositives about the characters: Deep, fun, and realistic characters\\n\r\nNegatives about the characters: None\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPeople who will love this: Shoujo and Reverse harem fans, comedy fans, and otaku's in general\\n\r\nPeople who won't like this: Fans of fast pasted action anime and People who like darker anime\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.00/10\\n\\n\r\nPositives: Funny story, Beautiful art and animation, Elegant soundtrack, fun opening, good dub, and deep and emotional characters.\\n\\n\r\nNegatives: The end, not long enough dramatic moments, Shoujo cliches, and the English opening\\n\\n\r\nThis was a fantastic anime that should be watched by shoujo lovers. It was very funny and lovable show. It's a show that's going to make you laugh out loud and have a fun time. I've watched this millions of times and I'll watch it a million more. Well, that's it for the review! I hope you enjoyed! \\n\\n",

            "content": "While I'm not a real connoisseur of anime and don't watch a lot of it compared to most users on MAL, I think many of us who have seen Ouran High School Host Club can say that is definitely one of the most unique series out there.  It's an enjoyable, lighthearted series to watch that definitely deserves the attention it receives.  If you're looking for fan service, romance, comedy, a nice story, and character development, this anime caters to all four.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nOuran starts out like many otome games (which is ironic seeing as it has an adaptation out for the DS now)where a girl is somehow roped into spending her time with a bunch of guys through a series of coincidences.  Our main heroine, Haruhi Fujioka, is not only a fish out of water in this regard but also due to the fact that she's a scholarship student attending a prestigious school for the wealthy.  With this setup you'd expect for these outside rich kids to be pretty shallow characters.  At first, you're right and it's funny to see their ostentatious and exaggerated personalities.  However, as you progress you start to learn more about the characters and their quirks.  The anime does a fantastic job of letting you get to know everyone in a fluid way (as opposed to character arcs) while preserving the comedy.  It's easy to get attached to all of them.  My one complaint is that the romance is underdeveloped.  If you're pitching for Haruhi to get together with one of the other hosts (you probably will the way the story is told) you're more than likely going to end up disappointed.  The manga does a better job with this, but the anime still is still a great story on its own.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nI've never been one to judge an anime based on its art or animation unless it's almost outrageous like Kanon 2002.  If I had anything to say, the art has a certain appeal to it that's either a hit or miss with viewers.  It's certainly very pink and shiny a lot of the time, but there are some episodes where the flamboyancy is taken out and you feel refreshed.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening is very sweet and sugary.  It's fun to sing along to, but the ending is just plain great.  You'd think Ouran wouldn't have such an intense ending given that it's a light, bubbly comedy, but the ending to me serves as a reminder that the events of the episode were more memories and experiences to help the characters grow.  What stopped me from giving this an 8/10 is that the soundtrack playing throughout the episode can be overdone and repeated at times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nThis is where Ouran shines for me.  It takes so many archetypes and contradicts them for comedic purposes.  It's pretty funny, and it doesn't get 10 stars from me for only this reason.  Some characters are admirable, some are laughable, but all of them are lovable.  They all have compelling, sound backstories and you feel for them.  Even side characters or recurring background characters are interesting to get to know.  What Ouran does so well and what makes the underdeveloped romance so frustrating is how much it builds on the relationships between the characters - and not just the MC's relationship with each host.  You start seeing them as lovable goofballs who work so well as a group that it's hard to see them without each other, which pulls you in even further to the anime.  Hikaru is my personal favorite.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nWhether it be for what antics they'll get into next or what's going to happen between the characters, Ouran is a series that keeps you coming back for more.  It's a very enjoyable series to watch because it's not entirely episodic but not entirely plot-driven.  You watch their journey, laughing throughout the way and getting your heartstrings tugged at.  The characters are memorable and they do what they do well.  I highly recommend it if you're a new to watching anime or if you're simply looking for an enjoyable, happy series to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review, so if you have any constructive criticism I'd appreciate it if you left me a comment (in a gentle manner as I'm a sensitive person). :)",

            "content": "*Warning: This contains spoilers*\r\nStory: Ouran High School Host Club was the first anime I ever completed watching. I was bored with reading the manga, so I decided to watch all 26 episodes in (I think) a week. Heck, the first I ever heard of this is when my little sister was watching it. Anyway, she recommended it to me because it was about a girl being forced to work as a boy for a host club in her private high school and all of the crazy shit she has to go through in order to repay back the damage of a vase she broke accidentally.I thought, why not? There is no why not because even though some of Ouran's episodes and adventures are cheesy (knowing that I watched the English dub doesn't make it much better), the show made it funny, very funny. Then, it did piss me when the show made it clear that Haruhi and Tamaki are supposed to be together but none of the true romantic stuff exists until the very last, fucking episode! Aaaaaaaaah! Well, I guess I know why the creators did it, and I shouldn't have any real complaints. Ouran does deliver the backstories of each character well enough to the point where I felt bad for every single one of them, even Kyoya (though I believe he's a douchebag to the max). If anything, Ouran doesn't have a straight on plot except for the fact Haruhi works at the host club just to repay her debt, which they barely talk about after the first or second episode. But still, the story wasn't the reason why I continued watching the show. For that reason, I rated it an 8 out of 10 on the story scale.\\n\\n\r\nArt: This is all a part of the shojo genre. It has pink all over, the characters are cutesy, the boys are in suits, the girls are in dresses, the eyes are big, what more could you ask for? It's not like the anime had flaws in the animation because it didn't to my understanding. If you want me to be honest, I don't really pay attention to the art in animation unless it's really important. I didn't stop anything wrong in Ouran, so for that reason, it's a full vote.\\n\\n\r\nSound: If sound means background music, then that is what I'm going to base my vote on. The theme song is pretty catchy, but because I watched all 26 episodes in a very short time span, I found it annoying (like anything Selena Gomez sings), so I skipped the theme and went straight on into the show. The background music in the show itself is good. It's not like they put in music that doesn't fit to the show at all. I mean, it's a slice of life. When something is emotional, they either put an emotional score or nothing at all. When it's a very sweet moment with Haruhi and Tamaki, they put in some romantic score. Even flashback scores have music that made me tear up. I didn't pay any mind to the ending theme song either. I know when I get attached to a song. I just listen to it until it ends. When each episode ends, I just move onto the next episode and watch the interesting stuff. I guess because of how Selena Gomez the beginning theme can be, how much I don't like the ending theme and the good job the show did with the scores, I rated this section an 8 out of 10 as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Each character has his or her own personality, and that's what I love most in anime. If the characters are Wonder Bread, I will not watch. The characters are the reason I kept watching this show til the very end. My favorite characters in this anime are (in the order of highest love and respect) Honey, the twins, and Tamaki. Honey is the most adorable person ever with a past that makes me cringe. For those who saw this already, I think you already know about Honey being forced away from desserts and cutesy stuff in order to take over the school's Karate Club, but Tamaki (being the kindest person in the world) teaches him to express himself for himself more than for anyone else in his life. You also come to learn why the twins are the way they are, and in all actuality, they are just the funniest characters in the whole series. Tamaki may be oblivious, but his heart is in the right place when it comes to Haruhi's well being in school. Remember the grocery store scene where Tamaki gets caught by Haruhi for spying on her, and he just uses the excuse her dad made when he did the same thing a longer time ago? That scene just made me fall in love with Tamaki. If there are two people I hate the most in Ouran, they are Kyoya and Renge. Kyoya is an asshole, and the only person who tries to make Haruhi's life miserable, and Renge has only importance in her first appearance, yet she still makes fucking cameos in other episodes where she's only seen once. God, her princessy attitude is so annoying. Every time I see her, she makes me want to shoot myself. I never got to explain much about Haruhi, did I? Well, her personality is almost close to Wonder Bread, but she has some things. Her purpose in Ouran is to be the character who questions her friends' motives but goes along with them because in the end they do the right things. Plus, I do feel bad that her mother passed away when she was a kid. Her father though, oh god, there are so many things I could say about him XD but I'll leave that for you to find out for yourselves. Even though she is the start of the anime, the rest doesn't not involve her as much unless it's saving her life or the boys get involved in her \"commoner\" lifestyle. Overall, the characters get a full vote, too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Like I said before, this anime is very funny and it makes you feel emotions you never thought to feel in a slice of life shojo. I guess the setting being a private high school for the richest people in Japan makes it a little less than slice of life, but still, it explains the lives of teenagers, which is the story that the show was intended to tell. It didn't give any false advertisements as far as I'm concerned. I cried, I laughed, I \"aw\"ed. There was not a boring moment whatsoever. I never had the urge to turn off my computer or anything of the sort, so in that case, 10 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Well, I pretty much said it all. According to the official score of rounded up 8 out of 10, I highly recommend this to anime fans everywhere. Yeah, it may be mainstream as Pokemon, Naruto, One Piece, etc., but the reasons I explained created the popularity it made it out to be. For those who are not interested in mainstream, just give this a shot. You won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "\"Very unexpectedly enjoyable anime!!\"\r\nThis is one anime that I never expected myself to watch. My girlfriend and her girlfriends went crazy about this anime. I took one look at it, and decided it wasn't my thing. Looked like the most girl thing in the world. \r\nLater, I was randomly on myanimelist.net, and I bumped into this show. I took a look at the story, and it was actually kind of cool. So I downloaded the entireshow in English dubbed. It was 12:30 p.m. And I watched the first episode. It was one of the funniest things I have ever watched! It had hilarious and awesome characters, a clever story, amazing animation, and so on. After that, I watched the 2nd episode, then the 3rd, then the 4th. At that point it was pretty late in the day and I decided to only watch up to the half way point. When I got there, I couldn't stop, so I decided to watch a few more episodes. On episode 20 I said \"forget it\". Next thing I know it's 6 a.m and I finished the last episode.\\n\r\nIt literally came out of nowhere by how much I loved it. In one day, it became my second favorite anime, (1st being DBZ). Everything about it is so cool. Not just for girls either, it's got some pretty hilarious guy humor as well.\\n\r\nThe story is pretty clever. During scholarship student Haruhi Fujioka's first day at Ouran Academy Private School, she \"accidentally\" joins a host club full of six male gentlemen, (all mistaking her for a guy) from a direct cause of her knocking over an 8,000,000 yen vase. After realizing her true gender at the end of the episode, they continue to have her serve as a host to pay the debt with her guy appearance and personality. The rest of the show is pretty much her tasting the life of rich people, while they taste the life of poor people.\\n\r\nThere's a bit more in the mangas, but I really don't care for them to be honest. Though I must say this is one anime that I enjoyed 100%. Very good and well made anime that is definitely worth checking out. Whether you're a guy or a girl, this should be enjoyable.",

            "content": "This is a beautiful piece of art, storyline, and voice acting. Haruhi is calm, cool, collected; smart, and sometimes so much so that she seems almost dull at times when the host club is at their most crazy. She almost seems like she wouldn\u2019t be the center of a reverse harem (those not understanding this, its when there are a group of guys for one girl instead of a bunch of girls for the guy\u2026 easy enough to get, right?) and pretty much not the type to be swooning over the boys. Well, your pretty much right but that\u2019s what makes Ouran High pop outmore then any other that came before. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the men, well they are as shallow and van as rich, handsome boys can be with a whole matter of stereotypes. A fun thing with this is that they don\u2019t really have every single male going after her, luckily, its more of the ones closer to her age and three get touched on while the forth really hides in the bushes to make way for the other. Yes, I am talking about Tamaki, Kyouya, and the Hitachiin twins Hikaru and Kaoru. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s touch the first three and then I will get down to my favorite and most logical choice after. Hikaru is the most headstrong of the bunch, the prankster and pretty much the one that gets Kaoru into trouble every once in a while. Kaoru is the one that\u2019s more\u2026 well kind in all aspects. When he\u2019s not with his brother, he seems sweet and good natured which might be why most of the girls swoon over the two when they go into their whole boy love thing\u2026 among other things\u2026 Kaoru always steps back and pushes Hikaru to go after Haruhi so that his brother can find love even though he does make it somewhat clear that he wants a bit of the action as well. \\n\\n\r\nKyouya is the brains and mostly profiteer of the host club, looking for the money instead of having the girls have fun, although he is able to pull a fast one when it comes to getting what he wants out of pretty much anyone around him, including Tamaki. Yes, the relationship between Kyouya and Tamaki every once in a while does tend to swing in the \u2018we are hot for each other\u2019 way, not that the author isn\u2019t quick to pick up on this fact and uses it to its advantage. There is a good reason why Kyouya is called \u2018Mother\u2019 in the host club although if it was for sexual reasons, he would probably be top. Nope, the reason is that I can tell that if he was a woman, he would be one of those girls that will flaunt it just to get anything out of someone.\\n\\n\r\nAnd last but not least, my all time favorite, Tamaki. Yes, he is an airhead\u2026 yes, he is quite clueless\u2026 yes, I know he sees himself as a father for Haruhi\u2026 uggg\u2026 now that freaked me out. No, I will not bring up that joke, he actually figures it out later why it\u2019s strange for him to be calling himself that but no, the reason why I like him to be with Haruhi is simple and it\u2019s one reason on top of many. It\u2019s because he is just like her Father. I know that is crazy but think of it this way, she knows how to take care of someone like that, she knows he has a good heart under all that blond hair, and she knows how pure his intentions were form the start. From the vary start, The Hitachiins would tease her and sometimes even go beyond to harass her, Kyouya really was mostly in it for the money, it seems that the only reason why Tamaki put his heart in soul into making her come with them was mostly, because he liked spending time with her and no matter if he tried to make her into a fully fledged girl, he in the end always went about saying that she needed to be true to herself. (If you can\u2019t tell, I can get into a lot of detail when it\u2019s an anime I really freaken enjoy!)\\n\\n\r\nNow, on to technical merits. The artwork is so beautiful and bright that when they start going comedy, they seem to lost a lot of detail and turn somewhat chibi-fide creatures. And yet, to me it works. I am happy most of the story line doesn\u2019t focus on all the customers that come in, letting the characters shine in their stereotypical designs although\u2026 how the hell is Hunny a martial artist? Ya, he looks nothing like it and the blond hair kind of pushes me off there as well. When the story starts to get dark is when most of the details start shining in a aposing danger is on its way, and the shadows mix well in to the details, making them stand out much more. Thoughout the show, there are a lot of roses and I do wish they wouldn\u2019t have so many. Ok\u2026 so we know the rose is a symbol of love\u2026 we get it\u2026 you don\u2019t have to flaunt it every freaken second that they are there for love.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also well done for both Dub and Sub. They pulled out all the stops with Caitlin Glass having solid voice acting next to Maaya Sakamoto for Haruhi. They both gave her more of a cool hearted not caring attitude that made up her character. Even better when she was playing against Vic Mignogna\u2019s rather overly fun character Tamaki. At first, I could not get away from how he sounded just like Edward from Fullmedal Achimest but I can see how the characters fit perfectly. Tamaki has the same style freak outs as Ed whenever someone calls him on something stupid he did or said that I couldn\u2019t help from smile. \\n\\n\r\nOther Characters got voices like J. Michael Tatum as Kyouya, Todd Haberkorn and Greg Ayres did a unbelievable job keeping the harmony between Kaoru and Hikaru even when the two were speaking \u2018with one voice\u2019 as it was. They used Luci Christian as Honey and it worked rather well, pretty much perfectly for the cuteness, Monica Rial as the over Otaku girl Renge, and I could not stop laughing at Patrick Seitz\u2019s depiction of Umehito Nekozawa.\\n",

            "content": "The anime really does catch up with the manga. I've also noticed that anime adaptations tend to be less complicated and shorter but it made it easier to watch. I realize that if it followed the manga completely, it would seem to drag on forever and I could lose interest. Sometimes it felt that way. I'm glad the typical shenanigans were included along with the most important parts of the story, and there were no fillers or anything; this anime was loyal to the plot! I especially appreciated the episodes that included background info on each character, enough so that viewers who haven't read themanga can understand the basics. However, I found that there was less character development, especially in Haruhi. She was surprisngly bold in the last episode, but there wasn't enough time covering her reasons to do so. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were impressive too! Tamaki's voice is fabulous. Hunny's youthful voice really scares me. Kyoya doesn't act his age but the voice is right. Mori's voice is captured perfectly, and I wish he had more lines. The twins have two different voice actors, but they sound great together too. Haruhi's voice was appropriate as well, but I wonder if she could pass for a guy in real life. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I'm most impressed with is the animation; the same emotion was captured, and the same jokes were still funny. I'm usually disappointed with anime adaptations because of the more rough, and sometimes uglier artwork, but this company did a good job! It certainly can't be as fancy as the manga, but these guys have really managed to imitate the original artist's artwork. I loved how lively the characters were! Since they frequently let Hatori in on their plans, the anime felt like a good equivalent to the manga. I was very comfortable watching it! \\n\\n\r\nI was debating with myself on the final episode..I wanted to watch it, but if I did, that would mean everything would be over! Noooo! The ending was happy, but not completely satisfying. But that's how I feel when I really enjoy an anime, I'll always want more. That's my first review, I hope it's not bad;\\n",

            "content": "Sheer brilliance with a beautiful soundtrack. I'm only hoping for a second season.\r\nIf your wanting an anime which moves swiftly through the story, not slowing down for slackers and charging through the plot lines, this is not the anime for you.\r\nHowever if you want to watch a bittersweet comedy which will have you in stitches by the end of each episode, this is the perfect choice.\r\nThe story focuses around Haruki Fujioka, a incredibly smart student who gets in to an elite private academy, Ouran High School. Upon entering a music room where she is trying to find a bit of peace and quiet to study,three things happen to act as a catalyst in changing her life.\\n\r\n1. She meets the six members of the Ouran Host Club\\n\r\n2. She breaks a 8million yen vase.\\n\r\n3. She is mistaken for a boy.\\n\r\nThese three events cause her to be indebted to the Host Club, the moronic (yet, in episodes to come, brilliant) President decides she must become a Host in order to pay off her debt.\\n\\n\r\nThe next 26 episodes are ones, while there is almost a non-existent plot line and you could pick up from almost anywhere so long as you knew a slight bit about the general plot, which will have you laughing - I guarantee it.\\n\\n\r\nThe music swells and fits the anime perfectly. Oboes, flutes, harpsichords and other instruments mirroring the very rich, very elite, very posh and almost classic feel to it. Some pieces, with vibrato strings, will have you and the character your watching racing for an answer, and another oboe piece will mirror the image being shown of the elite academy holding a ball.\\n\\n\r\nAn anime I'd recommend, even to those maybe not fans of shoujo. It has a high re-watch value, even if only watches minutes of a full episode for one brilliant punchline (Episode 22 with Mori's apprentice is fantastic) You will be crying with laughter by the end of it.",

I enjoy the satirical nature of this anime as OHSHC basically takes the piss of many shoujo clich\u00e9s. 10/10\r\nArt: I adore the way in which this anime is conveyed. The art is beautiful and romantic and often clashes with Haruhi's realistic nature. I cannot faultthe animation! 10/10\\n\r\nSound: I love the opening theme Sakura Kiss and often repeatedly listen to it.

I like how (in a way) it kind of spoofs other anime's along with otaku culture. \r\nThe storyline was great too, how each character had their own story and in the end, how it all lead up to how the host club came into being. The charachters themselves were all truly awesome! I really wish they had continued on and made a second season because there was so much that they left out from the manga!",

I expected the genre to be something completely different. The female admirers that would come by to watch the boys act gay really annoyed me. They were your stereotypical, squealing yaoi fangirls (I'm a fudanshi so I would like to see some male admirers or maybe at least one token gay dude.) One dude almost tried to rape the protagonist. Takami was unlikable. He was a fuckboy. Lol, I sound really bitter because I am. \r\nHowever, I didlike their play on your basic bishounen character types, some of the over the top humor, and the level-headed protagonist to balance out the quirky characters.",

That's why I love this kind of anime and drew by this anime to watch again as I became more critical in the early 20s. An adaptation of manga by the same name created by Bisco Hatori, this is Ouran High School Host Club.\r\nWhile usually I am drawn by an anime just because of its soundtrack, this anime actually drew me because the theme itself that is rarely being tackled by nowadays anime. A romance story of a tomboylooking girl. So, that's a major A+ for personal enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nAside from personal enjoyment, I really like how the story flows as we started to discover the true personality of Haruhi while discovering the personalities and backstories of each member of the Host Club. I know that it's not easy being around rich people especially if they are your friends. Haruhi managed to capture a smart yet humble commoner in a circle of rich kids. She knew how to hold her heads high while she would occasionally feel guilty for her friends paid everything for her. The comedy itself usually rotates around how Haruhi adapted to her damned rich friends which I could relate so much.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, I personally enjoyed Haruhi's English Dub. While the original Japanese captured the vibe of Haruhi as a boy whose voice has not developed from puberty, the English dub captured the vibe as a deep female voice that usually being mistaken as a boy's which, for me, is a better representation for a girl who is being mistaken as a boy. And yes, I love a Seiyuu who has androgynous voice and think that is a talent to have such voice. So, if you got some down time, you should check the dubbed version, too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime probably a must watch anime for you who love Shoujo anime and for you who proclaimed yourself as a tomboy. This anime really proofs to me that we need more tomboy romance anime more than we already have.",

            "content": "Ouran High School Host Club has been a breath of fresh air that has been much needed for myself. At first glance this is some cheesy romance which only has its worth in half-assed jokes and the ever present fanservice which is rampant in the industry. However, Ouran has been a story of depth and turns at every corner that has kept me excited as well as yearning for more, and yet a cheesy romance.\r\nThe story evolves around Haruhi, a girl who is forced to work for a Host Club, and the six other members of said Host Club. She is a commoner who madeher way into the Ouran School, a private elite institution. As a member of the Host Club, she conceals her identity as a women and acts like a man to pay of her debt for breaking a vase the club was going to auction off.\\n\\n\r\nThat is the premise of the story and it is an interesting tale. Each character is fully developed and interesting while they are also reminiscent of the common stereotypes they are. As the story goes on we see they are not the stereotypical characters we at first saw and that they are much more than that. They have faults and they have something to call their own.\\n\\n\r\nThe character I have an issue with, the only big issue I have with the series, is Mitsukuni. While I loved the \u2018twincest\u2019 going on with Hikaru and Kaoru, I just could not bring myself to enjoy Mitsukuni. I thought it a bit outrageous how feared Mitsukuni had become and how he nonchalantly he threw off his brother. Frankly, I think he is a little shit and my least favorite character of the entire series. Granted, this is anime and realism must take a back seat when criticising it, unless the show makes an actual attempt to be real.\\n\\n\r\nThe art has been a mix of what we are use to and of something more childish. The opening, though I had mixed feelings at first, I have come to love. It is something different, something other than what we all are use to. The ending, however, did not look as appealing as the opening was. Likely because of the style used to draw the characters, but that is just my personal opinion. The music for each was amazing and worth sitting through twenty-six times. The soundtracks for the piece fit very well and did not drag down the story. Sound and art were well done.\\n\\n\r\nThe show has its faults and is not perfect. I have yet to come across an anime that is perfect and Ouran has been one of the many anime I have watched to get close to what I would expect of a perfect anime. It is enjoyable and fun to watch. Ouran, though I was not its target audience, was greatly relatable and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nRounded Total: 9/10\\n",

            "content": "Ouran High School Host Club is one of the first animes for a while now that was able to keep me entertained from beginning to end. I seriously finished the series in a week I was that into it.\r\nStory:\r\nThough the story had a tendency to be just purely random, I like the creativity of using a host club as a main component of the series. It's something a little different than the normal high school based series. The fact that Haruhi gets dragged into this despite what sex she was made the story line even more entertaining. If you are looking for something to justsit back and watch for a laugh and no serious thinking, this is a good series.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was very good, not the best in my opinion, especially when it came to showing off Haruhi as being a cute girl, I think the artists could have made her look a little cuter, because she kind of looked ordinary in many scenes and they went on like she was the cutest thing ever. Ouran High School Host Club does have that traditional anime style that I like of over exaggerated facial features when someone is confused, mad, excited, happy, etc. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI'm going to say, though I have not watched the Sub version, I think the dub version was pretty good. I really like how they picked a voice actor for Haruhi that sounds somewhere in the middle of male and female and that can be easily confused with either one. That is the main thing that I think of when I think of sound for this series, is the good choice of voice actors, at least in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI believe the characters were pretty well developed. In the beginning of the series you get to know the characters and you think \"Oh, he's a jerk\" or \"He is the cutest little thing ever!\" but then, through out the series you realize there is more to those characters than the first impression they give you. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis series had me completely hooked. I HAD to watch all of it as soon as I started. There was only one episode where I started getting bored, but by the end of the episode I was dieing to watch the next one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt was a great series, not to the point I think it is a masterpiece, but I'm very glad I watched it and I understand why it is fairly popular. ^^",

And why didn't Haruhi leave? Well, I guess she thinks she's their friends now but if I were her, I would leave. But I everybody has their own opinions. I rate the story an 8.\r\nART:\r\nThe art is beautiful! The details and such, the character's facial expressions, all of it. Even if the artwas behind a bit from it's generation, it was pretty awesome. I rate the art 10.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nI actually have no idea how you rate the sound but I guess the sound effects are good? Am I rating this right? Anyways, the voice actors are cool I guess and the music is wonderful. I rate the sound 9.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nOnce again, Haruhi's dad. I want him to appear in the story and/or in Haruhi's life more. I don't know if that'll ruin the story but I sure do think that I'd love the anime more.

I can't watch it without grinning or laughing at the crazy shit that the host club gets up to, but at the same time get pretty damn emotionally invested. Honestly the characters are definitely what makes this. They're all so likely, and although comically stereotypical at times, it honestly just adds to the good times as it's done in a very self aware, parody-type style. In fact this, while parodying a genre, also just is a really good story with engaging characters so honestly itsucceeds on every front.\\n\r\nSo much fucking love for this series, everyone go watch it no matter what you're into because if you love stuff like this great, and if not it's basically a parody of itself too so you're good to go.",

The romance was pretty cute and I couldn't believe how funny it was, and the part about its humor is that its with rich people because in some anime most rich people aren't funny at all.

I intended to write this sooner but I've been so on the fence with how I felt about it that I just couldn't write this. However, I feel my overall score is more then fair considering the suffering I feel like I went through for this anime. Please do not watch the english dub, I beg you.\r\nI have read a few of the good and bad reviews for this series after finishing to help me collectmy thoughts on it and there is one thing that really bothered me about this series that another review mentions. This show really really feels like it degrades women. I mean it's bad! I couldn't believe they made Haruhi the bad guy because she actually helped the girls in the beach episode. I couldn't believe that more people thought she was male because she's not all that feminine outside of how she talks to people. For how many times I felt insulted of them degrading women in this show I was really shocked to learn this anime isn't that old.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art I wanted to give it a good score, I appreciate how detailed some of the background are for this series but the over all style felt like something that fell out of the 90s. In fact, this whole show made me feel like I stumbled in to 90s Japan. I couldn't believe the show was originally aired in 2006, I had to do quadruple takes at MAL's info.\\n\\n\r\nSound gets a 4 just for how terrible the opening and endings are. To me this is a huge deal considering that you are forced to listen to these at the beginning and end to every show. Earlier I said don't watch this in English and for me that's mainly because of the OP and ED. Ironically I didn't mind the English voice actors and found them nice and appropriate for the character they were betraying.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with the characters it the lack of development they get. I kept waiting and hoping for them to grow out of their cookie cutter personalities but just when you saw hope they'd rubber band back to their old ways which I found frustrating to watch.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment for the series is pretty down the line. There are some times when I would smile and giggle at something in the show and at other times I wondered if I was done with the series yet. For this I gave it a 5 which I feel is as neutral as I can be for this show.\\n\\n\r\nI know a lot of people hold this show in a high regard and that's great but it just wasn't for me.",

            "content": "I fisrt tried watching Host Club two years ago when a friend of mine recommended it to me. When I found out it was a shoujo and a reverse harem, I was very skeptical about it. Furthermore, the last show I had watched was Death Note, and I was not ready for the tone shift between one show and the other. Also, I'm not a big fan of episodic shows. All these reasons led me to drop Host Club at the time. But now, having watched a lot of shows since then and, consequentially, having changed taste and perspective quite a bit,I decided to give Host Club another shot, and I am very glad I did. It takes a very overused and worn out formula and polishes it up, gives it a fancy dress, teaches it to have some goddamn attitude and sends it to the highschool prom. In fact, none of these comparisons were chosen at random: Host Club does not limit itself to all the clich\u00e9s and tropes found in similar anime, but rather embraces them and completely messes them up afterwards to make something refreshing and interesting to pretty much anyone.\\n\\n\r\n   This handling is first and best seen in its characters. Every single member of the host club starts out as typical as typical gets, each one having one specific characteristic that makes them more or less appealing to the girls than the others. Where Host Club stands out in its genre is how it develops the cast throughout the show. The way each character is presented at the beginning serves only as an archetype to give them a base on which they can build upon. Each member is given some exposition, normally in the form of a flashback, showing who they were before joining the host club. Without giving any spoilers, I can safely say that all characters had backdrop that excused their way of being. Here, Host Club shows its social commentary facet. We see that the characters are heavily influenced by their economic status. The contrast between the rich boys from the host club and the poor protagonist works in favor of the show, and ultimately serves to show how everyone is a product of their social status and is forced to deal with the conditions they were born in to the best of their capabilities. \\n\\n\r\n   This not only serves the purpose of explaining the characters' personalities, but it is also shown in the present time as well. Many times we see the club members' families' influences. In one of the earlier episodes, Haruhi has to take a physical exam which would expose her true gender to the whole school. The conflict is resolved because the school's medical team took orders from one of the host club member's family, and so they found a way around the problem. Note that this was not simply a half assed excuse pulled out of nowhere to save the protagonist: it had been previously established that the boy's family had control of the biggest hospitals in all of Japan. It's little things like these that make Host Club stand out. \\n\\n\r\n   Another particular thing that I don't usually see mentioned is Haruhi's father's travesti behaviour. It's not often that I feel like a character benefited a diferent sexual preference or identity, and it's usually just for fan service. But here, not only did it went well with Haruhi's tendencies to prefer male's clothes, but it was also taken advantage of for one of the episodes, even if at a small degree. I felt the need to dedicate a paragraph only to his character just to be able to rub it on Mirai Nikki's writer and say \"THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE QUEER CHARACTERS, MOTHERFUCKER!\"\\n\\n\r\n   And speaking of fanservice, don't be fooled into thinking Host Club doesn't have any. Like I said, the show is simply a well executed and refreshing take on an established formula: it is still a slice of life reverse harem with lots of romance and fanservice at heart. In fact, from colorful and apealling visuals to a cheesy soundtrack ranging from classical to pop (that goddamn opening...) to quirky characters, it's as typical as typical gets. A highschool attended only by rich kids, the nerdy girl surrounded by a bunch of good looking guys, the fact that each host club member is defined by a \"type\", and the whole concept of a Host Club in general for that matter. Everything is so overblown that it just becomes downright fun to watch. It's sort of like the \"so bad it's good\" effect, but in this case it's something like \"it's so typical that it stands out\", in a good way.\\n\\n\r\n   And so, to conclude, although it is not the pinnacle of character development and it doesn't really have anything new to present, Ouran Highschool Host Club is a very enjoyable show, that can appeal even to people who dislike its genre. Now I finally have something good to recommend to my friends who like cheesy romances and hunky boys to write fanfics about.",

            "content": "I watched Ouran Highschool Host Club absolutely ages ago - I probably watched it during the year when I first started to realize what anime was, and when I first started to get into it. I adored the show when I first saw it, and every time I come back to it, I love it a little more. \r\nThe Story - The overall plot line of the show isn't anything groundbreaking or amazing, nor is it something that's overused and dull; it's a pretty decent story with no major flaws at all, but rather one that has charm and keeps you hooked without being toheavy. In other words, it's easy to watch without making the viewer feel babied or stupid. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art - I personally loved the art style; its bright but not gaudy, each character is distinguishable from the next, and it really gives the show its aforementioned charm. The animation flows and from a show made over 10 years ago, it still looks pretty darn great now and will hopefully stand the test of time. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound - The opening is catchy and every time I hear it, it brings back the memories of watching the show and forces a great big smile across my face. The ending was okay, but nothing particularly memorable, and I can't really remember much of the background music/the rest of the OST to be honest - I feel like it wasn't very memorable anyway. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters - I won't delve too deep into the characters, as I feel that they are the things that make the show what it is, and I wouldn't want to ruin the experience for anyone who hasn't seen it. Each character is different from the next and has entirely different quirks and (I feel like I'm using this word a lot) charms. There is also a lot of character development - obviously some characters get more screen time than others do, but none are left out, and they all are shown to develop their relationships with each other. The characters truly make or break a show for me (probably for most people as well), and the cast were definitely my favourite part.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Every time I rewatch OHSHC, I fall in love with it a little more; I feel closer to the characters, I laugh harder at all the silly little jokes, and it takes up a bigger spot in my heart each time. It's easy to watch and you have so much fun as you watch it, you feel invested in the characters and want to see how their relationships develop further, and you'll find yourself smiling after each episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Ouran Highschool Host Club an 8 out of 10. It's certainly not the best show ever, nor is it groundbreaking but, I had such a good time watching it, I loved seeing the characters and their relationships grow, and I fell in love with the show. It holds a special place in my heart, and I hope that you'll give it a shot.",

On top of that, it seems to be generally really well-received and enjoyed.\r\nAlas, I gave it all 26 episodes to win me over, but it never really happened. Although Haruhi is refreshing as an MC (intelligent, not clueless, not tsundere but not easily swayed by emotions, etc.), the rest of the characters in the show are really, really terrible. Although the show makes some attempt at conveying self-awareness that all the other Host Club members are representations ofanime/manga archetypes, they don't go far enough as to be true parodies. Had they pushed the characters a little more, the show could've been hilarious; as it is, the characters are simply SUPER obnoxious. They become uber-representations of the 'type' they're supposed to lampoon, which makes it profoundly difficult to a) enjoy the show and b) like any of the characters outside Haruhi. \\n\\n\r\nSimply put, Ouran tries to subvert the harem genre but doesn't quite push it far enough; the result is boring, 'why-do-I-care-about-this...?', long-winded series whose only redeeming feautures are its gorgeous art and decently unique MC. I would honestly recommend skipping this title. This is the first time I have ever thought a series or movie was *seriously* overrated on MAL, and I felt compelled to share my two cents.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Best comedey/romance anime ever.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story line was pretty simple. Just your average teenage boy trying his best to get a girl who is completely clueless in terms of relationships. (maybe i shouldnt say average when the school they're from is filthy rich). After the first few episodes i knew what was going to happen in the end, but it was incredibly interesting to watch anyway.\r\nArt: 9/10 \r\nWhen i first watched this it was drawn different from the action/adventure animes i usually watch but it siuts the anime well. There weren't much fight scenes so the animators didn't have to work so hard, but thecolours in show really match the mood of the anime(light and bright).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nSound is pretty much the same as the art, it matched the anime. Mostly played cheery background music since this is mostly a cheery anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10 Hilarious\\n\r\nThe characters were incredibly funny and they're unique personalities really helped the overall image of the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI'm not lying when I say I almost split my gut laughing at the jam-packed comedy in this anime. My advice to you is take a break from all the action/adventure animes and watch this insanely funny show. I guaranty your sides will hurt from laughter with every episode you watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall this really is an great,interesting anime with tons of comedy that you never get board of. ( I've watched it 3 times).",

            "content": "As you can tell, I absolutly adore this series. It's a brillient cocktail of comedy and romance that kept me hanging out for every episode as they realeased.\r\nStory:\r\nThe two stories in this run side by side amazingly. The mixture of a everday japanese girl or 'peasent' as she's so fondly reffered as, thrown into the world of the rich, glamourous and slightly air-headed. then there is the storesi of discovery and growth. As Tamaki and his mottley crew widen Haruhis world, Haruhi brings out the best and the worst in every charater, forging new and strange frontiers for each of the boys. The anime doesnot wander too far from the manga (which is amazing in my humble opinion) but when it does, it does it with flair. The anime-only comedy could only be pulled off in this story and on T.V. Love it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe manga-esque style of this romance-comedy reflects the over adorned host boys and prefectly portrays the romance and comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe background music of ouran is wonderful. Dainty tunes all over the place. Also, the voice acting is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nHaruhi is one of the most amazing characters I've ever seen. She fits no cliche at all. She is not out going, shy,quite,kind,loud, or any of that. She does not sream and demand like haruhi suzumiya, nor does she squeal and trip over herself like Karin-chan. No, she is so normal and yet she grows the most and pushes the story along more than any character I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall:\\n\r\n10/10 all the way. Never ceased to amaze me. Never let me off the edge of my seat. I was squealing and crying and laughing all the same. I was enchanted just like the girls who visit their beloved hosts day to day. This anime is deffinatly a fine one.",

So I search for the anime on the net and download them and watch it. Surprisingly this is one of the best comedy/romance comedy around.\r\nAlthough the storyline isn't as great as other anime withing the same category, but thanks to the author, they manage to make it as interesting as it is. But I have to say that I do hate episode 13, because of those fantasy/imagination event. I personally think it shouldn't be there.I do understand that Haruhi was able to speak to her mom at the end of the episode, witch is rare, but the whole thing just a bit over the top.\\n\\n\r\nSimple romance comedy with bunch of cutie and cakes and laugh, definitely for anime lovers that prefer fun and enjoyable time.\\n\\n\r\nBrilliant voice actor selection and opening and closing soundtrack are some really nice compliment of the anime I have to say.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough sometimes I think there might be bit too less host in the club, but with the addition of Haruhi, thats make the club as whole new club with fantastic characteristic view.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the most enjoyable romance comedy around, because I watched the whole series 5 times on me Ipod *blush blush*\\n\\n\r\nNo doubt I will recommend this anime to my friends who loves anime, but the problem is that most of them already watched it before me :-(",

But it was the little details that really made it great.\r\nAt first you think it's just a cute funny comedy with silly boys running a ridiculous host club for silly girls, but as you go deeper into it you discover how deep their personalities are, and that rich people don't really have it all.  You aretaken into a world that is both serious and hilarious at the same time.  (Really you will cry because you are laughing so hard.)\\n\\n\r\nThe romance it there from the beginning, and it is developed wonderfully.

Personally I really liked big watery eyes, Hikaru's design and Honey's \"cute mode\".\r\nSound: is maybe a little to high/low on some parts but OST is good for this kind of genre.\r\nCharacter: are brilliantly described and they have own personality. Especially twins and Host club background story/history.\r\nEnjoyment: in this anime is 100% for me. It really surprisedme for being so god damn good.

What's great about this show though, is the hilarious way in which they solve problems, as Haruhi plays a boy in a host club (which is basically like being a man-whore, without the sex). The comedy in here is great, but what really drives the plot home, is how the most eccentric characters are actually soft normal beings.\r\nWhat's bad though, is the fact that the background stories of Hikaru and Kaoru get too serious, and really slow down thepace of the story. Plus they really seem like jackasses once their childhood is explained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a 9/10, the ending was pretty bland, and the opening humor is very misleading (the humor just wasn't as good when the eps continued...Still good though).",

            "content": "I'd never even heard of this show before someone brought it over to my house for an anime night. I hadn't watched any kind of \"romance\" shows before and didn't even know what a harem anime was, let alone all the types of characters you have in them, so this show was actually pretty educational. I learned a lot between belly laughs, and I laughed enough to add years to my life.\r\nThe premise is pretty simple, the lead female Haruhi gets into a debt with an all boy club, which is based on pleasing the other girls at school. Romantically, sheesh. Haruhi then has todress as a boy in order to work off her debt, leading to countless situations where she's mistaken as a he. Simple enough, right? Not exactly...\\n\\n\r\nSeeing as this is a \"reverse harem\" it means everything is sort of a parody, I think. It would explained why everything is jacked up to 11 when played for laughs, such as the extremes of the other boys in the club. You have your strong and silent type, your identical twins with a cheeky side, your prince charming, the intellectual, and the younger cuter one. Everything they do becomes so outlandish and extravagant that you won't be able to stop laughing. They're the kind of people who'd have a desert themed party and fly in sand from the Sahara, just for the day. Each character has a downright charming personality, and the trouble they get into is so much fun to watch. Better still, the most successful \"host\" for the girls is another girl. I gotta say, my favourite part of the show is how the boys try incredibly hard to keep Haruhi's secret that she really is a girl. Try getting through a physical exam at the nurse's office!\\n\\n\r\nThe art style feels a bit like Revolutionary Girl Utena (read: there's a strong flower motif) which I actually really enjoyed to my surprise, while the limbs looked a little spindly for my tastes, but the show really did make it work quite well. The animation is very nice, I don't remember a single scene where something was obviously out of place or rushed. I can't say the same for the music however. Music is one of the big things I try to pay attention to, you can always tell when a lot of effort gets put into it because you get this feeling of completeness. I liked the cheesy intro theme but the ending one was like rubbing alcohol on a fresh cut, but I will admit they fit in quite well to the theme. The actual soundtrack to the show was enjoyable, but not entirely memorable. I can remember it fit nicely with the visuals, but I can't remember any specific themes or pieces.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself is largely episodic, which really helps to change the setting. New episode? New party. The comedy is done so well, it's even surprisingly high brow. It never reverts to crude sex jokes, as easy as it would be, but relies instead on witty dialogue, financial separation, mistaken identity, and playing around with gender rolls. I'll admit, I was pretty weirded out when the twins pretended to be romantically involved, but then the penny dropped and I couldn't stop laughing at their acting. If you're familiar with harem personality types, you'll enjoy how committed each character stays to them. If you're like me, this is a great title to try to see if they're for you. The final few episodes I really enjoyed, they added just a splash of extra emotional depth to the main lead characters and the closing scene did tug a bit on my heart strings. By the end of this show, I ended up enjoying it so much that I bought the DVD so I could share it with others. This is a show best enjoyed with friends.",

            "content": "Albeit skeptical, I found myself absolutely in love with Ouran High School Host Club after the first episode. It only took me seven years to convince myself to give it a shot, right? \r\nThe most admirable aspect of this anime is the character development and serious tones which somehow manage to blissfully accompany the pleasant heart warming comedy. Only pictures sit still in time; it's up to each individual to decide if how much or how little they'd like their world to change. By the end of this anime, you'll be strongly re-enforced with the cliche idea that it's okay to be yourself.\r\nStory (8/10}: Atypical, not so typical reverse harem situation where the main character Haruhi (a girl) enters a host club. In this club, the rich boys cater to rich girls needs and desires, i.e they entertain them with their dazzling charm and corny lines. On the other hand, Haruhi is a \"commoner\" who can't help but face-palm at the silliness of which the rich depict the commoners lives to be like. Needless to say, Haruhi finds herself staying with these members for quite a bit of time, the more she helps them, the more she finds herself being helped. \\n\\n\r\nSound {9/10}: The opening was amiable, it gave a sense of \"welcome\", beckoning the viewer to please let go of their troubles and indulge themselves into the anime. The ending was oddly beautiful; it seemed to send a message of growth, as if pushing someone forward into another action that has yet to be taken. \\n\r\nCharacter voices whether Japanese OR English were pretty spot in in my opinion. Haruhi's voice was extremely fitting in both situations for her \"gender neutral character\", and the twins had slightly(depending on language) different voices but were able to, with ease, make them sound similar when they joined in unison. The back ground music in specific scenes fit perfectly, especially during the few serious moments.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10): Can you believe it? This art was done in 2006; it could easily be dismissed as a 2013 anime! The characters were drawn wonderfully, with intent to appeal to the viewers. The characters facial expressions were hilarious at times, and when the few serious moments came everything seemed to fade away leaving nothing but a serious subtle tone. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10): Aren't characters the key components to successful anime? What they say, do, think, feel, that is what is the catalyst to every event that takes place. Each character is funny in their own way; whether it is by their actions, words, or even expressions. Yet they all seem to have a hidden in-depth past, filled with a variety of dark and happy events. Regardless, they are all lovable and likable. Their actions are always supported by their personality, even if that personality has yet to be revealed; it will be explained. The twins were probably the most prominent example of character growth. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall (10/10): I can't help it! The anime made me laugh far too much, and it even tugged a heart string once or twice! The symbolism of growth and bonds of friendship where oh so cheesy but fitting. Rambling aside, this was a prime example of a successful comedy which laughably mocked its own genre whilst perfectly executing it at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n",

            "content": "I have this conspiracy theory that everything aimed at women/girls is somehow better than the inverse aimed at a male demographic. This show perfectly encapsulates that theory of mine. Despite my avatar, I'm largely not a fan of harem shows. According to anime.plus its the lowest weighted genre score I have scored (in around 16 titles). Then why pray tell did I enjoy this? Is it that homoeroticism somehow turns me on? Well, no not really. \r\nIs it the story? Not exactly, the story can be summed up as: person ends up intimately situated with a number of members of the opposite sex who areinterested in them. Standard fare from what one might expect from a harem show. See, what sets apart Ouran High School Host club from its contemporaries in the harem genre isn't so much that the roles have been reversed as it's execution of the concept. Its the way the characters feel and interact with each other which makes all the difference. While I would struggle to describe your average harem protagonist in more than one sentence.\\n\\n\r\nOur main character Haruhi Fujioka is different. Her strong personality is outlined when she refuses to allow certain misconceptions about her way of life to fly around, while at the same time not caring about what she deems trivial (such as stereotypical gender roles) choosing to care more about a person's actions than the situation they were born in (for somewhat obvious reasons). She's driven by her own ambitions and motivations while interacting with the world around her. The agency she has in the story despite the helpless situation that's she's put in clearly separates her from your standard harem protagonist that often feels like a passive agent in his story letting the world and by extension the people in it completely decide their direction in life (due to a lack of their own). \\n\\n\r\nThat isn't to say that Haruhi herself is perfect far from it, though it's her character flaws that make her relatable and turn her into a fully believable human being which serves to set her apart from the crowd of 'bland, normal and unremarkable nice guys' that typically take the reigns of our main character. \\n\\n\r\nAll of that is why this show is a lot more watchable. The fact that the boys around her would fall for her instead of the myriad of other girls in the school is infinitely more believable largely in part of her character and her backstory (which perfectly feed into each other). Speaking of the boys. I think I would go remiss in not mentioning that this is another area in which this show has proven itself to be superior to other shows in its genre. While the archetypes are there the author took the time to explore and explain why the character act the way they do and even provided some character growth for most of them despite the extensive cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, I feel the show is well animated though lingers a bit too much on still shots I assume for budget reasons. In regards to presentation, the previously mentioned homoerotic moments didn't really help the show as far as my enjoyment of it. I know why its there and hey if that's your thing don't let me stop you. I'm just saying It didnt serve to enhance my experience and possibly even diminished it slightly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4\\n",

            "content": "From the year 2018, Ouran Host Club is a bit dated; not in art, but in concept. Or, perhaps, it was ahead of its time, in a way. Let me clarify. The show attempts parody and often achieves some level of subversion that is really charming. Other times, though, the tropes and stereotypes and gags leave a bitter sensation on my sensibilities. The first 10ish episodes really are a bit formulaic in a way that starts getting tiresome and problematic. Later in the show, development happens in plot structure and in character, making me really get into the show. As it is, this is alight 8--maybe a 7.5 if MAL allowed for it. But the latter half of the show--13 onwards--was very charming. \\n\\n\r\nI've seen reviews really criticize Ouran for being sexist and regressive and a failure at parody. I (mostly) disagree. The depiction of the two trans characters was not stellar, though I'd argue each had highlights that were done better than depiction I've seen in any anime shy of full on Wandering Son. But I got the sense that it wasn't talking down to women; all of the students were frivolous and flightful, not just the girls. All of them deluded themselves, one way or another, and were self important. It seemed to me that, while there were troughs were I found the depiction of the girls at the high school distasteful, most of the time, it seemed more like making fun of rich teenagers without a care in the world. \\n\\n\r\nI would have liked to see a bit more of Haruhi's intellect showcased, but generally speaking, I liked the show. If they had cut and tidied up the beginning and some of the gags, it could have been an easy 9 from me.",

While I had previously dabbled in one or two Studio Ghibli films, this show made me fall in love with anime comedy and continues to do so with every rewatch. \r\nNow, I'm not going to strut in here and say, \"This is the greatest shows of all time! It's a masterpiece!\", because that is far from the truth. The pacing is iffy. A lot of the jokes may go over your head. Some jokes are repeated way too much. The twin-cest is weird until you realize its a facade but it's still weird.\r\nHowever, I willstrut in and say that I highly encourage for you, especially those of you who are squeamish of flowers and all things pink, to watch this show through. There is far more underneath the luxurious floral surface than you may initially realize.\\n\\n\r\nI am not going to go through every aspect of the show and grade it. I will simply surmise that this show was thoroughly enjoyable to me. This is why:\\n\\n\r\n-This show parodies Harem anime by actually looking into the stereotypes and proving that the characters don't fit into their cookie cutter roles as much you may have thought\\n\r\n-The wealthy v middle class contrast allows for hilarious scenarios and just great comedy\\n\r\n-Haruhi is a wonderfully sarcastic protagonist that doesn't fall in love with any of her potential suitors and always calls people out on their shit\\n\r\n-There is rather impressive character development mixed in with out of this world nonsense (i.e. alligators in an indoor water park? a convenient banana peel thrown for plot?) \\n\r\n-The intro is a fucking jam\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show is all over the place. It's strangely chaotic, yet has moments that slow us down and allow us to appreciate the characters and their dynamic. I love this show. I love the outrageous characters and the real heart-aching moments that occur. Don't be scared away by all the roses. Instead, \"KISS KISS FALL IN LOVE\"!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Character development is scarce compared to the manga, but that's to be expected considering that it's a comedy and not meant to be taken all seriously, but the lack of character development still takes away from the show.\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nIt follows a classic older manga/anime style; big eyes, big heads, but my one complaint is that characters all havesimilar head/nose shapes. The backgrounds are drawn well and it corresponds well with the feel of the current scene\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nEach character is unique (unless you compare the twins to eachother) and Tamaki acts a bit homosexual at times? The host club males all have stereotypical personalities, the flirty loud type (Tamaki) the nerdy quiet one (Kyouya) the tall strong, quiet one (Mori) the boy lolita type (Honey). It's easy to get a grasp of their personality and how they're like through the first few episodes of the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of my favorite animes, and it never gets boring as I watch it over and over again, even if I know what's gonna happen already. If you haven't watched Ouran Koukou Host Club, then I'd strongly recommend it\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: this is my first anime review so i might've not done a good job of writing it, sorrryy uwu",

It delivers its plot in such a way, that by the first 7 minutes of this show, you'll be laughing your ass off.This anime delivers a fresh take on Romantic Comedies. Haruhi, the female lead is very different from most shoujo female leads. She's sort of, lets just say ' TomBoyish' but not really tomboyish. you get what I mean? She's feminine but not Feminine at the same time. \r\nThe show includes mild romance and often, sometimes completely disperses it by adding humor.\r\nAll in all, this is a funny and great show, thatjust so happens to be ranked 2 on my favourite animus.",

I found myself wanting to try something a little different. \r\nThe first episodes completely sucked me in. It\u2019s an interesting premise, and had me chuckling throughout the season. I liked to see how the social dynamics played out between the host club, their female visitors, and Haruhi as she played around with her gender fluidity. Tamaki is so dramatic(\u201cCapricious is just another word for creative!!!\u201d)and goofy, but he\u2019s good-natured and part of what makes the show flow.\r\n*However* Past the half way point, the episodes got kind of boring.or should I say repetitive? I know lots of people like the twins, but after a few episodes in a row only focusing on them, i got bored and literally fast forwarded past their parts.\\n\r\nThis show was a trip to be honest. It\u2019s not *that* deep, but sometimes you\u2019re not looking for that. The characters\u2019 personal stories can be a bit bland sometimes, but I enjoy the way the Ouran club interacts with each other when they do. They made me laugh despite myself.",

It is probably one of the best anime shows ever. It's got romance, drama, sad parts, hilarious parts, and great music. The opener and closer are great, and the rest of the music just suits the anime so well. The characters in Ouran are all complicated, but not in a heavy, dark, I-had-a-sucky-childhood way. They keep the plot going and the anime moving along. The art is also very well done.\r\nSo, to keep it short, Ouran is a  HILARIOUS must-watch anime. No excuses. Go watch it!",

            "content": "I give this colorful romp a 89/100\r\nBefore I start my review, I'd like to say that I found this anime before I became totally ambitious about watching anime in Japanese. So yes, this was one of my very first TRUE anime (by true I mean dubbed in Japanese before it ever got licensed for the US market). I found it on it's first run in 2006, and I thought it looked nice so I checked it out. I had NO idea what I was getting myself into.\r\nSo, it's about Haruhi Fujioka, a young not-so-rich girl who gets a scholarship and goes to Ouran Academy, aschool for rich kids. After finding herself in debt she gets recruited by the school's host club run by very beautiful men, and she has to impress lots of girls (who don't know that she's a girl) so she can have her debt paid off.\\n\\n\r\nAnybody that watched this and Fullmetal Alchemist (which I haven't. Don't kill me) will know that FMA and this are made by the same studio: BONES. Bones pretty much spoiled this anime with great animation, detailed backgrounds, wonderfully vibrant character movements, and pretty much everything else. It's just that good.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great too, consisting entirely of classical undertones, violins, pianos, etc. It's not used just for drama, but for satire as well. Normally when comedies have BGMs to them, they're mostly just crude sound effects (like the ones in Ed, Edd, and Eddy, which is awesome). Ouran however uses its soundtrack well for comedy and drama as well as everything else.\\n\\n\r\nSure this seems like your typical reverse harem anime, but it is a LOT better than most harem anime. Why? Because although the characters are set to have some kind of stereotype at first, this anime parodies them and breaks the characters out of their molds at the same time. Not only that, it's got great execution, great comedy, great use of character development (which is something that most reverse harems lack), and a very interesting back story.\\n\\n\r\nBut what really made the show for me are the characters. Namely Haruhi, the lead female. She's so totally NOT your average reverse harem lead. She's TOTALLY uninterested in the guys trying to get her attention, doesn't know how to freshen herself up, knows what she wants to do in life, tries to make the best of what she has, and isn't a stereotypical damsel in distress. I would gush and gush about the other characters, but that'd take too much time. But I will say that they're all great, well developed, neatly fleshed out, and excellently portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nThis and Digimon Savers were the two anime that really got me ambitious about anime like I am now, but I think Ouran did it the best. It's a sweet, funny, and cute story that's basically a big pink frilly explosion of neat ideas, and a great one! If you're looking for a nice comedy that's not cliche or bland or anything like that, then go to the Ouran High School Host Club! The men will sweep you off your feet! I already got other people into this anime (including my childhood friend who's a BOY), so you'll like it too!",

            "content": "So when I was first read the description of this anime, I was a little skeptical about watching it. I read some of the reviews and that is the main reason I decided to watch it. When I started it, it didn't really impress me that much. The storyline was okay. Some of the characters are a little over the top but overall, their personalities mix together really well. While watching this, I found myself making myself watch the rest of the episode because it was so boring. A lot of the episodes were filler episodes, just telling you how each member became a partof the host club and Tamaki's relationship with them. \\n\r\nSo i'm gonna start with some of the pro's. The anime is very entertaining. The over the top characters are a huge reason for the funny moments of this anime. The anime also has a wide variety of characters. There's the 'prince' Tamaki, The twins 'Twincest' Hikaru and Kaoru, the boy lolita Honey, the quiet tough guy Mori, and then the more level headed characters Kyoya and Haruhi. Each character also has a deeper past that may surprise you because of all their happy and bright personalities. The concept of a club that entertains girls is also a very interesting idea. \\n\r\nNow, some of the cons. One major con I had was the filler episodes. I don't know about you, but I like it when something interesting happens within an episode. It keeps me watching. That's what makes me want to watch the next episode and that's exactly what this anime was lacking. I found that after watching the next episode I wouldn't want to watch the next just for the reason that I didn't think it was going to be good. I also feel like, you needed to watch the filler episodes because they would reveal something about someone's past that would make you understand them more. That was the only major con, but just that one con made it so hard for me to finish this anime. \\n\r\nOverall, I don't think I will be rewatching this anime anytime soon. I would recommend this anime to someone wanting to just pass time though.",

            "content": "In my first year of high school (first year of middle school for Americans, I think?) I had a friend who got me into anime, although I only ever watched the most popular ones such as Naruto and Fairy Tail. By second year, I was out of that little phase I had and straight into my embarrassing emo phase.  However, a few months ago, I came across Ouran High School Host Club online and decided that it would do no harm to watch it.  Thanks to this anime, I was dragged completely willingly back into the world of anime.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nOuran, while being setin a school with lots of attractive boys and a tomboy female main, was completely unique. Each episode brought it's own completely new lighthearted, sometimes emotional, plot line. The story was extremely easy to follow and the drama was nothing too cringe-worthy. I found myself laughing every single episode without fail.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nComing from someone who knows next to nothing about art and styles of art, I found the art absolutely amazing! The animation was really fluid and pretty and it is quite clear that a lot of time and effort went into making this anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI think the sound is one of my favourite things about the anime. The soundtrack consisted of all classical orchestra compositions which truly fit in with the atmosphere of the anime and I adore the ending song. The opening theme is not my favourite, but catchy and quite enjoyable, however that is all down to taste.\\n\r\nThe voice actors (or Seiyuu; whatever you call them) where perfect for their roles and I truly couldn't think of anyway to make that aspect better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you ask any of my friends, or have read any review for anything I write then you would know that characters and their development is probably the most important part for anything for me, and the characters in Ouran are still some of the best I have ever had the pleasure to get to know.  At first, all the males of the Host Club come across as stereotypical 'hotties' - the kind that I hate - but as the series progressed, we find out that there is so so much more to these boys than you could imagine. Their pasts get explained so effectively and you really see so much development in the characters (particularly the Hiitachin twins!!) as the anime goes on. Haruhi is such a wonderful heroine because of how well developed she is. She has her good points; kind, considerate, observant - but the thing that made her truly amazing were the fact she had flaws; sometimes unmotivated, defensive, impatient. \\n\r\nNot only were the main characters great, but every single side character or character that appeared for a single episode were thought out and they were treated as well as the main characters. Their pasts were always explored and their personalities diverse and intricate. I felt emotions, whether they be happiness, sympathy or anger, for each and every one of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 \\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI've watched this anime three times since discovering it in December 2013 and I haven't gotten tired of watching Ouran in the slightest. The show makes me happy, makes me laugh and even cry at points (but then again, I get emotional about a lot of things) and it has easily made it's way straight up to the top of my favourites list.",

            "content": "First review so bear with me X).\r\nOuran High School Host Club eloquently combines humour, a whimsical and erratic style of artwork, and heartfelt themes to create an animated masterpiece that appeals to a wide array of genres.\r\nI would usually opt for a more action based show, but the humour of the show absorbed my attention so vehemently that I was hooked completely and did not feel that there was any sense of lacking in spite of the absence of an abundance of action sequences. That being said, the few action scenes placed throughout the series were thoroughly satisfying :)\r\nWhile the story line appears superficial atfirst, the show craftily weaves deeper meaning within each episode to beautifully create a touching episode arc. \\n\r\nThe show is conducted in such a manner that each character is allowed the opportunity to empathically reach out to the viewer through their trials and struggles. It is rare that a show possesses more than 3 round characters, yet in Ouran Host Club each character shares an ever-changing charisma unique to them that is practically tangible beyond the fourth wall (which is broken so wonderfully often in the show).\\n\\n\r\nI was especially a fan of how the show managed to keep a light overall theme while still exploring more appreciable and meaningful topics and emotions. The show is a paradox in that the artistry keeps one on their toes and is full of erratically placed scenes and surprises, yet the storyline is familiar and easy to follow (This is what I believe allowed the show to remain lighthearted while investigating more serious emotions).\\n\\n\r\nBefore I wrap up here, I should of course also mention that The Host club was hysterical. I don't think I've ever laughed as hard from another show... It has raised the bar for satirical anime.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I LOVE that Haruhi is a strong female lead set true to her beliefs. To me that is a prize within a romantic genre, so I was so pleased to follow Haruhi's story within the show.\\n\\n\r\nAlbeit- I am relatively  new to the anime genre in its entirety, from what I've watched so far, this show stands out among others. This is a show I will come back to watch when I need a good pick me up, or when I find my life missing the hilarity of all its beloved characters that fill it with such charisma. You will not easily leave my inner mind's theatre Ouran High School Host Club.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this! It may not have been a perfect review, but I had a lot of fun writing it, so I hope it helps.",

            "content": "*Anime Legends Part 2*\r\nPreface:\r\n\tThis didn\u2019t originally start out as an Anime Legends review, and I\u2019m still not sure if this deserves a higher rating than Brotherhood, or Ping Pong the Animation, or my other 8\u2019s, but during the process of writing this review I\u2019ve come to terms with my love for this show, despite how somebody would perceive the show to be like, if they never watched an episode, and if he or she just read a synopsis of the plot. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\n \t\u201cOnly those with excellent social standing, and those from filthy rich families, are lucky enough to spend their time here, at theelite, private school, Ouran Academy. The Ouran Host Club is where the schools handsomest boys with too much time on their hands, entertain young ladies who also have way too much time on their hands. Just think of it as Ouran Academy's elegant playground for the super rich and beautiful\u201d -Tamaki Suou\\n\\n\r\n \tBased off the premise of the story, I never would have thought that I would love many aspects of this show. I\u2019m already not a huge fan of having a harem, but a reverse harem seemed like all it would be was oodles upon oodles of manservice, causing me to eyeroll into oblivion, but thankfully I was dead wrong. Now for a  while I was thinking that this could be one of my favorite anime series, it just does so much of what it strives to do so well in such a meta and original manner that I couldn't help but to admire what appeared at the start to be a reverse harem, problem of the week type of show. The story begins with commoner Haruhi Fujioka trying to unload and relax when she stumbles into music room #3, the home of the Ouran Host Club. And being her clumsy self she accidently breaks a vase which forces her to become their dog/servant in order to pay back her debt, but here\u2019s the real twister he is actually a she, she just looks like a boy because of her short hair, and due to the fact that she never really wears anything girly or frilly. After that we see her relationship grow with the other members of the Host Club, with episodes diving into their individual backstories, and that is pretty much it. Besides paying off her debt there isn\u2019t or wasn\u2019t much of an old goal for the show, but they way they are able to conclude the series was thrilling and action packed but wasn\u2019t all that satisfying. I mean this is more of a parody of the genres it emulates, but some sort of actual romantic payoff with the twins or Tamaki would have been nice, and they never even reveal to the rest of the class that Haruhi was a girl the whole time, I mean she is dancing in a dress near they end in public, but she is still shown wearing her boy school uniform. I mean she really doesn't care how people perceive her to be gender wise, and that is really great, but wouldn\u2019t it be cool to see their reaction, or to wrap up some of the other character development that was left to dry when the series finished, but oh well. Most of the comedy comes from how delusional everyone in the show is besides Haruhi, and how Haruhi reacts to their grand delusion is hysterical, and how over the top the romance gets can be just insane and cheesy enough to get a few laughs. The only negative aspect to the comedy are the monkeys or whenever they slip on bananas peels, it isn\u2019t funny it's just random and dumb, besides that though the comedy in this show is stellar. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n\tHaruhi is the main character, and definitely the most relatable, she always seems to get fed up with the other members, and her sarcastic comments whenever they are putting on a show for the ladies are gold. She doesn;t seem to mind what people perceive of her on the outside, because what's on the inside is much more important. She is a very perceptive person, who is able to see through pretty much anyone. She is the first one that the twins Kaoru and Hikaru really can connect to, since she is able to decipher between them so easily. She is often adored by the members of the club, and the girls customers who see him as a kind hearted and cute person. It\u2019s a bit unbelievable that none of the girls customers were able to put two and two together but whateves. She is a very strong and independent person who is only really afraid of lightning/thunder. Even though she seems to be liked or admired by most she tends to like to keep to herself, and thinks about the simpler things like going to grocery store in order to take up a sale on chicken. She is often patronized by the members of the club for her less than stellar situation at home, but she stands up for herself and others quite often. For one line of dialogue in particular she kind of reminded me of Daria from the tv show Daria except was less pessimistic, I\u2019m not sure if I have a single problem with her. She, being a commoner, is the butt of a lot of jokes, and due to how outragneous most of the club members acts she is a fantastic straight man. She is an amazing lead character, and whenever she isn;t on screen I wish she is. Also the title cards for each episode with her dubbed voice reading off the description was nice addition to the show. \\n\\n\r\n\tTamaki Suou, the renowned president of the Ouran Host Club, He is incredibly suave with the ladies when he wants to be, only wanting to see them smile, and brighten their daily lives. He seems to have no real dark side, and is almost childish in the way seeks to help others out or bring happiness to their lives if they call on the Ouran Host Club for help. While almost everyone he asked to join the Ouran Host Club was against it at first, he was able to warm them up to the idea, by saying just the right things, and by not giving up. He becomes obsessed with Haruhi after learning of her true gender, and he consistently comes to her aid, or rushes to her whenever anything happens claiming to be her father, or at the very least a father figure, which is really weird considering his real feelings for her. For a while all I could think of whenever he talked was Edward Elric considering how similar those two voices Vic Mignogna did, but that made him even more endearing to me, because of how I was able to hear a much more emotionally and silly version of Edward through Tamaki. He is an idiot, who becomes shell shocked whenever anyone disagrees with him, but at least he\u2019s a graceful, loveable, idiot (who is also a killer piano player). \\n\\n\r\n \tMitsukuni Haninozuka, is a third year student who is the boy lolita type, with a sweet tooth, and is pretty much an indestructible weapon, his backstory episode really added depth to his character, but he still comes off a little annoying to me, and pretty selfish at times overall. The Twins Kaoru and Hikaru Hitachiin are fantastic together and the mind games they are able to play on others is at times devlish. Their development, overall growth was interesting, with each brother coming out of his shell more and more, and trying to connect with others besides each other. Still the twincest weirds me out a bit (not actually twincest but kind of twincest, it\u2019s pretty confusing to me). Takashi Morinozuka is the strong, silent type who acts like a bigger brother for Mitsukuni having a lot to do with their families master-servant relationship. She never really gets all that much development, which brought up in a hilarious fourth-wall breaking moment, so I can forgive it. Kyouya Ootori, is definitely the member of the group who is the most logical and intelligent, without him the club probably would have been burned to the ground long before Haruhi was forced into joining, and eventually becoming a full fledged member. He seems to act only if the situation is self advantageous, though Haruhi sees right through his cold act exposing his softer interior. These other members are pretty memorable on their own, first coming off as annoying and pretentious but they start become endearing the more they interact with Haruhi, really acting as the family that Tamaki always envisioned themselves as.  \\n\\n\r\nArt Style/ Animation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThe art definitely has the Shoujo style with large cutesy anime eyes, but I really like it for the most parts, it can get very expressive and cartoony at times. The show\u2019s colors are very vibrant with a lot of pinks and blues. And there are a lot of great visual  showing how cheesily romantic the show gets at times  The backgrounds for the most part are extremely elegant and detailed. The club room, is as fancy and sophisticated as it gets. There is an obnoxious amount of cherry blossom and rose petals thrown around, whenever they enter the club and many transition or character actions utilize roses in the background. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThe music throughout the show exudes extravagance, and it is for the most part quite serene and playful. It really compliments the rich and carefree lifestyle most of the students of Ouran lead. Most of the piano tracks are simple yet profound when played against the right backdrop. There are a few more theatrical and music I could see being played at a ballroom dance. The sound effects used are often colorful and very effective, most for a better comedic effect. Like whenever Tamaki is turned down, or the use of arrows to point out an object that will be really important in a couple moments. The opening is a cheesy, girl japanese rock track, and at first it seemed really generic or out place, but the more I listen to it the more endearing it becomes. It fits the fun and comedic vibe the show gives off very well, though it contrasts quite a bit from the OST. The closing harder rock track sounds almost like a parody song as if it was sung by one of the creators of South Park, still it rocks hard and that cheesy almost intentional badness really gets you excited to click play on the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tThe Show is extremely entertaining, hilarious, and interesting despite what the show is about. The characters unique personalities are great in contrast with how normal, and logical Haruhi can be. I love pretty much everything that Ouran tries to do, but it never really connected with me emotionally. Ouran knows what it is, and what it wants to be, and it excels in that regard, but I\u2019m at a crossroads with giving this series an actual rating. I really can\u2019t decide with this show is just great, or if it is one of my favorite series, but I\u2019ve seemed to view anime series with an emotional or deeper meaning as superior to those without it, but it isn\u2019t fair to compare shows like Clannad: After Story or Steins;Gate to Ouran Host Club. As mainly a comedy in my eyes, Ouran is leagues above most comedies and slice-of-life high school shows, so fuck it. Ouran gets a 9/10. Fuck it, I don\u2019t care if it's a reverse harem, I don\u2019t care if it is extremely girly and adorable. I\u2019m giving Ouran Koukou Host Club a 9/10.",

The creators nailed in with each personality, even bringing the girl into the mix of it. \r\nThough with everyone being so different, they manage to get along as if family. At one point in the anime, one \"Prince type\" even calls himself daddy with the complete opposite being mommy, Yeah, it's a little messed up there.\r\nI watched this with my sis, laughing the entiretime. So this anime is safe and enjoyable to watch with others. Of course it isn't just about the romcom part of the anime. It actually has a story line.\\n\\n\r\nAt first it was hard for me to actually pick up the storyline, though thanks the anime itself.

            "content": "Before watching Ouran High School Host Club, I had read many positive reviews and lots of people calling it their 'favourite anime ever' etc, and since it came out nine years ago, I was quite late in watching it just recently. So, I started watching it with high expectations of it being a hilarious anime with great characters. In my opinion, it's a good anime with some likeable characters. For me, its the kind of anime that makes you smile when you watch it, and smile when you think back on it. But it's not a particularly exciting show, and at times it could bea little long winded. That's not to say you shouldn't watch it - but continue reading to find out what I liked about it!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nIf you don't know already, the story is about a girl, Haruhi Fujioka, who gets given a scholarship to 'Ouran Academy', a very expensive high school for rich people, basically. Haruhi is mistaken for being a boy on her very first day, causing her to be forced into the Host Club when she smashes an expensive ornament. In the Host Club, the members spend their time entertaining girls who have 'too much time on their hands'. While she is in the host club, she makes friends with the members, and each episode is mainly about different events they host in their club, their main priority being to bring happiness to all girls and such. Many of the episodes revolve around just a single character, which can be nice to get to know them personally. The main theme in this anime is comedy, but there's also a lot of seriousness when you get to learn about the mostly sad things the characters had to endure in the past. There's no serious romance in this anime, I guess you could say there's a bit of puppy love, but I don't think the characters even realise it when they start to like another character. I'm being vague, because I don't want to spoil anything. The reason I gave the story a 7 is because I personally, haven't seen an anime quite like this before, rather than focusing on high school life in general it is specific to school clubs and it also gives you a lot of insight into the character's pasts, so you can really get to know them. While the story was unique, some of the episodes could get a bit repetitive for me, which is why it is only a 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI'm definitely not an expert on what is good art and what isn't, but there was something really nice and 'refreshing', as anime characters would say, about the way the characters were drawn. Even though this anime is fairly old, the characters are all really good looking and very unique. Some of the scenes in this anime are really beautiful, there is a lot of bright colours used, especially pinks, giving more of a cartoony feel to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe OP is strangely addictive, I find myself singing it all the time. Some of the music in this anime is beautiful, mostly piano based, but the show doesn't revolve around this as it is more focused on comedy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nSome of the characters I loved and some I found myself growing tired of them. But, that's just because of my own likes and dislikes in personality types, so you can decide that for yourself. In the host club, every member represents a different 'type'. For example, there is a princely type - and while he acts charming in the host club, his true personally is completely oblivious and he is always making a fuss - which did start to get on my nerves, after a while. Haruhi has to be one of my favourite characters. She is the normal type, she's kind, funny and genuine - I basically think she's nice to everyone. I don't want to go into too much detail on the characters, since they all have their own qualities about them and you will definitely find some that you like, and some that you dislike. Having said this, the bonds between the characters are definitely enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI really did like this anime, but at times, the episodes became slightly tedious because of repeated jokes. For example, Tamaki, the blonde haired prince type, continuously calls Haruhi, the main character, his daughter, and overreacts when anyone goes near her. While this was funny at first, it quickly became boring. Some episodes focused on only one character, so if I didn't like the character.... the episode wasn't that great for me. However, the chemistry between the characters was great to watch. My two favourite characters, Hikaru and Kaoru, are really funny, so they made the show great to watch - and in my opinion, their past is the most interesting, so the episodes revolving around them were thoroughly entertaining. As I mentioned earlier, it all depends on which characters you like. But there will definitely be some, if not all, that you love. Some of the jokes made me laugh, like how all the host members are so clueless about life as a 'commoner' (as they call Haruhi), like they get excited over things they've never seen before such as instant coffee.",

            "content": "What can I say? An anime based on a stereotypical concept that girls should be entertained by some handsome boys? That would sound like something totally misogynous to reinforce an exasperated \"machismo\" culture.\r\nOuran Koukou Host Club (OHC) gives this first impression, and I should personally say I didn't like the first episoded because of that. However, as the anime went through, I was able to see  that I got a completely wrong image. OHC is an anime that adresses questions such as gender identity and makes an ejoyable satire of the various clich\u00e9s that domain human idealist affective relationships. I must confess that Ilaughed a lot with Tamaki's obessivness,  the incestous Boy's Love relationship of Hikaru and Kaouro,  the coldness and utilitarism of Kyoya, etc. The \"Hosts\" are enjoyable creatoins that not only are able to make fun, but are also well good developed with a strong emotional background that shows this Host club is not only a matter to entertain, but rather unify.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the major credits that this anime has is its major and fabulous protagonist. Haruhi is a true genuine and marvellous character that makes a perfect synchronicity with all the other ones Haruhi is a true feminist character, a true heroine that challenges the fact that gender identity is irrelevant at the time a person wants to define himself (it is not a surprise that a girl dressed up like a boy was the most popular host among girls) and what really matters is the individual itself. It is beautiful to see the contrast between this silly and untrascendent girls and the only mayor female character of the show, who is the only one able to affect and understand mainly all the members of the club. The female-empowerment of this anime is just brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nTo end, this anime is a very interesting piece that I would not hesitate to recommend. It is, in fact, one of my recent discoveries that have let me a true sad-sensation at the time I had realized it has ended.",

            "content": "Even though I haven't seen this show in a while, I still would like to share my thoughts about one of my favorite shows of all time, Ouran High School Host Club. \r\n You may be wondering why I'm doing a review of this show just out of the blue without any recent re-watching. Well that is actually quite simple to answer, I'm currently in the process of reading the manga and fairly often I enjoy going back and re-watching my favorite episodes from this anime. But anyway let's jump straight in.\r\n Ouran high school host club is the 2006 anime adaptionof the shoujo manga by Bisca Hatori. The main premise is a girl who looks like a boy on scholarship at a extremely rich school  and she breaks an expensive vase belonging to a group of young man who are a part of the host club. She is then forced to entertain female guests as a way to pay off her debt. Silly? Yes. Bad? HELL NO! This show manages to combine several well executed traits to set a literal gold standard for reverse harems to come. \\n\\n\r\n  So what makes this show so good, well let's start with presentation. The animation of ouran high school host club is very glossy, well polished, and nicely drawn. The movements are also fluent and the atmosphere of the anime shifts in a smooth fashion. As far as voice work goes this piece excels at this aspect. Several great English voice actors including Vic Mignogna who voiced Edward Elric in fullmetal alchemist. \\n\\n\r\n I couldn't really give the story that high of a rating due to it being episodic comedy but there are some fine storytelling elements present here. And the comedy is handled very well and is entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nEasily the strongest aspect of this show is the characters, the characters are all extremely well fleshed out. Screen time and depth is given to each character to ensure that you become invested and that you notice different traits overtime. The dynamic relationships between these characters are awesome and well realized. Some of the best character interaction is the twins, Haruhi and Tamaki, and Tamaki and Kyoya. A good amount of this show's characters focus on how they can be changed. By meeting someone else in your life you can be changed and have your personality developed. And this causes character diversity and for characters to have meaningful change and development over time and features real character and relationship depth. \\n\\n\r\n  The OST and opening and ending themes were well done and fit well with the show. Well composed themes in episodes arise and can have impact on an episode. Side characters aren't slacked on either because alongside our 7 main characters we have a satisfying bounty of side characters who also have good depth and support and grow alongside the main characters.\\n\\n\r\n  My enjoyment of this show as you can tell is very high. And even though I watched this show a while ago I still remember several details of it and I still love it. I watched this show when I didn't really know a lot about the medium of anime and you can definitely say it had a profound effect on me.\\n\\n\r\n Overall OHSHC is a must watch for romance and reverse harem fans. It features fantastic and diverse characters, amazing animation and great English voice work. It also takes romance anime cliches and performs a smart parody of said tropes. So in hindsight Ouran High School Host Club, you must watch this, it's one of the most special anime I have ever seen.",

She is level-headed, straightforward and responsible for her age. \r\nAll the guys in the club may seem very stereotypical at first but as you further down the episodes you discover they each have a past that made them who they are. \r\n It is definitely a must watch!",

He's so dumb and dense that he thinks he loves the heroine as a father figure despite being a year older than her.......\\n\\n\r\nHoney is a little boy who likes sweets and stuffed animals, takes afternoon naps and basically just acts like a baby despite being eighteen. He must have been sleeping when the puberty train passed by. He has a loyal, faithful dog named Mori who rides him around everywhere and only talks when need be.\\n\\n\r\nNext, you have two twins who think they are so much better than everyone around them, they view the world as two types of people: idiots and them. Yeah because they are so smart they didn't know what the hell instant coffee was. Or an apartment unit for that matter. Freaking morons.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is a smart guy behind the financial operations of the club. I don't have a problem with Kyoya, he was one of my favorite characters.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, there were quite a bit of episodes with a lot of humor. Some were funny, other times they tried too hard with the exaggerated reactions to some situations. There really is no plot. It's just one of those anime where each episode is its own story. The last episodes could have happened sooner, like around episodes twenty up to the end. I suppose it's no different from other harem anime. So if you like this kind of anime where something interesting happens the last few episodes then you might like this one. At least you will get some laughs along the way.",

            "content": "This one snuck up on me. I'm attracted to comedic slice-of-life for their airy quality, the way that, given time to breathe, a simple story can be elevated and achieve a kind of true, everyday beauty. This frees the characters to be better fleshed out as their development is the focus of the story, rather than the focus being on building a more classically structured narrative, where the characters are judged by their usefulness in the grand scheme of the series as well as on their personality. But there is no grand scheme in (slice-of-) life.\r\nOuran does all of those things. The series is oneof several superficial pleasures -- and by superficial I mean luxurious, extravagant pleasures: not only the richness in display, but the operatic/theatrical aesthetic, with a focus on the glow of... well, everything. It has the essential-to-the-genre scope of silly adventures, the travels and themes-of-the-week and pastiches & homages to different genres -- and does every single one of them gloriously.\\n\\n\r\nBut where it excels, where the series actually got to me, was the unexpected tragedy of these characters. Those adventures -- better put: the Host Club as a whole -- are slowly revealed, as the background and history of those characters are shown, as doomed escapism. These are characters who are prisoners of their own birth, boys born of wealthy and traditional families that give them no space to decide over their own lives -- and, also for this, they have an underlying darkness, an edge that keeps showing its face under their well-mannered and charming exterior. There is a subtle but constant exploration of how unhappy they were until the forming of the club, and an even subtler implication that this unhappiness has its roots in the social obligations imposed by Japan's society, and their status therein (...which kind of makes this a little about those poor, millionaire kids, but I think that's forgivable, since their aloofness to the lives of the commoners is one of the biggest sources of dramatic tension and humor). This subtext, of course, turns into text in the home stretch.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the series isn't (mostly) dramatic. Quite the contrary: there's a huge generosity to the characters that inhabit the school, the characters of the week whose involvement with the group helps them find true love, access their true feelings, or just to feel better about themselves. It's also very, very funny. But more than anything - and also better than anything - Ouran is this complicated, slow burning, love story: one, (kind of left alone to simmer) about how a devious twin seems to find his own self through love; and, two, how the revelation of Suou's tragedy (when he finally has a past/history) affects a series-long uninterested Fujioka. \\n\\n\r\nFujioka is a great lead, her lack of interest in everything etc, but also her almost supernatural understanding of the people's feelings (she's got to be some kind of empath) is consistently charming. She can go from whatever-she's-there-too to perfect-thing-at-the-perfect-time, and this is one of the greatest strengths of the series -- which makes things more perfect when something that is hidden from her, and the only thing she seemed incapable to access via her keen observation, comes to light, and gives the series, finally, its romantic apex. And, even better, this forces all the characters to revolt against their condition and achieve some instance of freedom, in an all-out operatic ending\\n\\n\\n\r\nLoose thoughts:\\n\\n\r\n- Monkeys throwing banana peels as an unstoppable force of chaos.\\n\\n\r\n- Mori's very telling heritage of servitude to Hani's family.\\n\\n\r\n- The implications of the ending promised such a great next arch! Which leads to my biggest complaint:\\n\\n\r\n- Somehow this isn't a thousand episodes long?? THIS IS A TRAVESTY!! (Haha get it? Like Fujioka's dad? I'll show myself out)\\n\\n\r\nMVP: The chotic-er-than-monkeys-throwing-banana-peels twins. Mostly for their really original relationship, which might be my favorite thing in the whole series.",

I mean, all that\u2019s important is what\u2019s on the inside right?\u201d\r\nAnime is an art medium that has no shortage of silly rom-com\u2019s. Unfortunately, it also has no shortage of mediocre ones. This is something I had noticed when I was first getting into anime and slowly but surely converting me into being the otaku I am now. However, one anime I saw some time ago that I really loved was Ouran Highschool Host Club. From the first to last episode, the laugh-until-you\u2019re-crying-from-laughter comedy, surprisingly mature and emotional story-lines, lovablyeccentric and very well written characters and unapologetic & frequent meta humour absolutely won me over. Of all the good or mediocre romantic comedies I have ever seen in anime, this one is one of my favourites. Why exactly? Well\u2026\\n\\n\r\n*Warning, some minor spoilers ahead. There is a summary at the bottom if you care about spoilers or don\u2019t want to read the entire review..*\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to writing, there are few things harder to nail than comedy. A multitude of elements all have to work synchronously including timing, atmosphere, witty punchlines and pushing a joke far without totally breaking the audience's suspense of disbelief. Ouran somehow manages to pull it off. It is incredibly not subtle in its jokes and pushing character archetypes to their extremities. Despite that, it works because of how they use these stereotypes situationally. It also has some great running jokes. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the best recurring jokes is the fact that the Hosts (besides Haruhi) know very little of \u201ccommoner\u201d goods or lifestyles. So every time that Haruhi (our heroine) brings one, it gathers a lot more attention than it deserves, making the other hosts both incredibly condescending and yet also genuinely giddish. In terms of both framing and comedy, this works so well because they have shown the characters to be unusually excited by such cheap and uninteresting goods, playing on the audience's expectations. \\n\\n\r\nOuran also has some of the best comedic timing I have ever seen and the best example of this I can think of is one of the scenes I laughed the hardest in. This scene also shows all of Ouran\u2019s best qualities when it comes to comedy.  This was when it looked like Haruhi was leaving the club for a equally hilarious and ridiculous Zuka club, who seemed to be a female parallel of the Host Club. The plan they finally decided on was for themselves to dress up as females, as they thought that appealing to her feminine side would convince her to stay in the Host Club. \\n\\n\r\nNow what I think works so well here and for many of the other jokes is how they unite taking a joke to hyperbolic levels of absurdity and still having it make sense for the characters to do in the first place. We have seen a lot of scenes of the Hosts dressing up in ridiculous and expensive looking costumes, so it isn\u2019t too outlandish or jarring to see them dress up in drag. It also works as situationally, she has been hanging out with a lot of dudes due to her debt. It wouldn\u2019t be totally out of the question for Haruhi to want to hang out with girls either, despite the fact that she doesn\u2019t really care about that. Lastly, there was the pure shock factor too. Since it wasn\u2019t foreshadowed or telegraphed, there is a lot of genuine surprise when you do see them looking very ladylike (at least, more than usual).\\n\\n\r\nEven though Ouran is gut-bustingly funny, what I think gets unfairly overshadowed is how good some of the more emotional scenes are written and the close bonds (sometimes a little too close) they share. As the anime moved into its second half, the narrative got considerably more serious. Ouran delved into the sadder or unfortunate circumstances that some of the Hosts were dealing with. It tackles a wide variety of common problems that adolescents deal with as they grow into adulthood, including acceptance from family, dealing with a strict family that has already decided your future or even loss of close family members.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly thought that Ouran was best when it was taking the goofy characters and having them mature and grow past their problems. It was written in a way to not only make these super rich characters relatable to (mostly) anyone else watching but it also made them more than just the tropes that the comedy often confined them too. They had balanced both the more serious and dramatic moments very well with plenty of great jokes and hilarious situations.\\n\\n\r\nIf I really had any complaints about the writing, it would probably be the ending. Now the last few episodes were easily some of the best in the entire show. It for the most part brought some sort of conclusion to the main protagonists arcs and implied a potential romance blossoming\u2026 key word there was \u201cimplied\u201d. Because the anime was airing while the manga wasn\u2019t really done, there was only so much they could do about the ending. But since it is an adaption, comparisons to both the anime and manga ending are inevitable and the manga's ending was honestly far better. It provided a final resolution to the characters while resolving the romance as well and is by far my favourite part of Ouran (in either the anime or manga). \\n\\n\r\nBut no matter how good your writing is, I believe the writing is often only as good as the characters and honestly, I think the characters are Ouran\u2019s biggest strength.\\n\\n\r\nHaruhi Fujioka is easily one of the best female protagonists I\u2019ve seen in a shojo anime. It\u2019d be one thing for her just to be sorta tomboyish and broke as an obvious foil to the frivolous and rich Hosts. However, Haruhi is much more than just your atypical Shojo protagonist; she also is just an excellent character in her own rights. What makes her character work so well isn\u2019t just her non judgmental personality or her keen emotional insight; its how much of a positive influence she is on her peers.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show heavily implies, she and the Hosts live in two different worlds. Haruhi helps both worlds see more eye to eye. She helps humble them and be kinder to others (thus being better Hosts) and they help her normally anti-social personality to open up more, teaching her to also have fun along the way.  Which brings me to my personal favourite character in Ouran, Tamaki Suoh. \\n\\n\r\nTamaki\u2019s character development in some ways is rather subtle. He starts out being overly dramatic and downright obnoxious and in many ways, that doesn\u2019t necessarily change.  At first, he just sorta plays the silly king/jester who is often the punchline to many jokes. As the tone in the show changed to focus more on character drama, we started seeing Tamaki for who he really is. \\n\\n\r\nDeep down past his obnoxious and goofy facade, Tamaki is easily the most selfless, compassionate and in many ways the smartest/most insightful Host. He was often able to understand his friends emotions even better than they were able to and hardly ever seriously asks for reward or acknowledgment in return. And when Tamaki and Haruhi were together, you were really able to see each other bring out the best of the other, making for a great romantic connection between the two.\\n\\n\r\n Another notable friendship is the one he has with Kyoya. Tamaki managed to identify Kyoya\u2019s inner turbulence he was dealing with because of his family, resulting in Kyoya being honest with what he really wants and even expressing himself in the way of his choosing. Lastly, another smaller reason why he stands out as the best character was that Tamaki did all this while still dealing with a mother who is missing and a very strict, cruel and selfish grandmother. \\n\\n\r\nOutside the main cast, there are two more characters I\u2019d like to briefly touch on; they are the famous Hitachin twins, Hikaru and Kaoru. Their character arc primarily deals with their own isolation and how to interact with others. Hikaru (my favourite of the two) later on is shown to be rather emotional and immature, reinforcing his lack of consideration for others feelings. The best example of that is when Hikaru goes out on a date with Haruhi. He gets consumed by jealousy and even at one point, abandons the date in Haruhi\u2019s time of need. Yet he still came back and was there to help her when she needed it. That was easily my favourite Hitachin bros scene as well as one of my favourite in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in Ouran wasn\u2019t super noteworthy, as it\u2019s mostly just classical music with original tracks occasionally. Despite that, there are definitely some solid tracks that I found myself returning to. My personal favourite is the piano version of Sakura Kiss (the opening theme). It played during some emotional moments of the anime and it worked very well, enhancing the scene in the anime and bringing back memories of Ouran listening to just the track itself. The opening theme is also catchy as hell and brings a smile to my face everytime I hear it. \\n\\n\r\nFrom an art and voice acting perspective, Ouran is also very good. The animation and art direction was fantastic as usual by Bones, using lush, vivid colours while keeping true to the original artstyle of the manga. I can still remember the plethora of roses whenever the hosts are charming their guests. The voice acting was also spectacular. Caitlin Glass does a fantastic job as Haruhi, embodying all her snark and subtle compassion and fear buried inside. Vic Mignogna was amazing as Tamaki, embracing all of Tamaki\u2019s silliness and obnoxiousness wholeheartedly in his performance. Other notable performances include Travis Willingham as Mori and Todd Haberkorn as Hikaru.  \\n\\n\r\nSummary: \\n\\n\r\nOuran High School Host Club is a fantastic standalone anime. While it\u2019s last episode pales in comparison to the end of the manga (as it wasn\u2019t finished), it still managed to balance hilarious comedy with great emotional drama. Its characters are incredibly loveable and memorable even years after watching Ouran for the first time. Honestly, I highly recommend watching this before reading the manga, as I think that it's the best way to experience Ouran for the first time. Afterwards, read or purchase the manga and read for the definitive ending, as it\u2019s worth it for that ending alone. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cA person can change, at the moment when the person wants to change\u201d\\n\\n",

She enters the Ouran private school because she has good Grades. One Day she searches for an quite place to study and she opends the door to the Ouran highschool host Club.There she meets the host  who think that she is a guy (and tease her). Huruhi tries to explain Herself but than she stumpels and a reallyexpensiv vase goes to break. From now on is she the dog of the host Club. -So this was the First 3 Minutes of the First episode,but what is actually so great about this anime?It's simple there are the characters,ther unique and special in there own way and everyone of them struggels with there own Problems. though it seems like an comedy anime with a Happy atmosphere,behind it's facade it is really deep and relatable.Ohh and have we Talked about the artstyle yet? It may seem simple or normal or maybe boring but for me personally it is beautiful and one of my Favorite Anime Artstyle.One other thing i like to mention is the opening and Ending. The Opening is really catchy and gives you good vibes,the Ending is really catchy too but for me personally it has something to it that the opening doesn't have and it is special to me (and one of my fav. Songs too) Overall you can say that OHHC is really fun to\\n\r\n watch it is so much fun that i literally re watched it 10 times (and i will really watch it an 11 time after i finishing writing this review) because it never gets boring \\n\r\nFor me it is an 10 out of 10 and i recommand it to everybody who watch anime because I think that anyone can relate to it",

            "content": "Finally......I can review something I actually kinda sorta enjoyed quite a bit.\r\nStory: A poor girl gets accepted into this prestigious school for the extremely wealthy and blah blah blah. What I like about the story is how its not too complicated. It is easy to follow and for the most part, and keeps watchers entertained. Unfortunately, they seem to keep most of the interesting parts in the manga portion of the series, which is a letdown. For instance, I would have liked to see at least a little bit of the romance that happens between the two main characters. Its quite a shame sincethey are both have great personalities, and aren't annoying like other couples(cough*kirito*cough*asuna*). The story also seems a bit generic. Maybe it wasn't at its time, I mean the anime is kinda old, but that whole 'rich boy meets poor girl' kinda gets annoying after a while. I have to hand it to the anime for at least making the rich guy sweet and likeable.\\n\r\nI'll give the story a 6.\\n\\n\r\nArt: While its not deplorable, the art did not exactly wow me. I found the flowery backgrounds quite corny to be honest. I wish the animators would have spent more time giving some life to the characters and their facial expressions. The actual character designs were great though. Haruhi is cute, and the boys are as handsome as they are meant to be. \\n\r\nThe school uniforms for the girls need to be burned though. \\n\r\n5 :/\\n\\n\r\nSound: Whoever voiced Haruhi deserves a hug. She doesn't sound like an overly kawaii character who swallows a bucket of helium before talking to people. Nice and chill. I like it. I recognize Tamaki's voice actor from other anime, and he's great, but at times I wish he'd tone down on the dramatic lines a bit. Others are fine, but nothing too special. 7\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Now this is what surprisingly made me enjoy the anime. Haruhi possesses qualities that other anime heroines lack. Shes as smart as people say she is. She is also kind, caring, but has her limits. \\n\r\nOh, and she's short. Like me. So for that she gets extra points :p\\n\r\nTamaki is gorgeous, and acts like a prince, but is not shallow, which is something that's important to me. I really like how fond he is of Haruhi, and how much he cares about his friends. It made me want to be friends with him, which is good, because that's how main protagonists should be. They shouldn't make you want to punch them in the face, at least not all the time. I do wish his past wasn't talked about so late in the anime. It could have served a better purpose than some of the filler. As for Hikaru and Kaoru, I have mixed feelings. Hikaru is my main problem. I couldn't tell if he was a nice, a devil, or a tsundere. Kaoru is fine, Mitsukuni is kinda annoying, Mori is bae, Kyouya is......hhhhhhhhhhhh i dont know or care, and Renge needs to leave. Now from this, you'd think the character rating would be mediocre. Nah, the dad was amazing. He was funny and refreshing. \\n\r\n9.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you like shoujo-related stuff, this might be just the anime for you. The stuff that's good is very good, but if you like action with tons of character development, run FAR FAR away. \\n\r\nBut this is about me, not you :P So i'll give it an 8.",

The focus in this anime really is on the comedy and doesn't weigh you down with a lot of heavy thought provoking story lines, romance, or tear jerking moments. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have substance. The characters are well developed and even though each episode is a self contained story the overall arc of the series does a great job at showing the growth in the bonds between the characters. The last two episodes take on a bit more serious tone but still mix in a good amount of humor. The show also isn't yourtypical harem slice of life as you probably noticed. Doing a reverse harem story line is a refreshing change of pace opening it up for different kinds of humor.",

Even if, years down the line, I revisit this series and hate every last minute of it, it will always be important to me because of that fact alone.\r\nHowever, I don't think that's likely, because this is a comedy that may as well have been constructed after consulting my brain.\r\nAll of the characters are snarky and witty, but utterly sincere when it counts. The boys of the Host Club proper all begin as teen angst dramedy stereotypes who are slowly fleshed outinto three-dimensional characters, and the chemistry they share with each other and Haruhi is priceless.\\n\\n\r\nI love all the little ways this show satirizes modern teen pop media and their fanbases. Like, how all the patronesses of the club go nuts for Hikaru and Kaoru's homo-incestuous act, or for that scene between Ritsu and Haruhi; it's the most perfect mirror of slash fandom I think I will ever see. Tamaki steals the show time and time again with his over-the-top fantasies of how he will capture Haruhi's heart, only to be constantly stifled by her levelheaded common sense. And the little blonde girl who knows tons of manga/anime tropes because all she reads are shoujo manga. Or the thousand other moments of pure comedic genius, satire and not, that I'm currently forgetting. There's even an \"Alice in Wonderland\" episode, a tribute to one of my favorite stories-- and animated Disney movies-- ever.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think there's much left I can say. I adore this show, and I think I always will, on some level, no matter how much anime I watch, no matter what shows I love, this will always rise a little above the rest, if only because it's my first.\\n\\n\r\nMy journey as an anime watcher is just beginning, but I see no end in sight.

I was a bit skeptical starting this, as the thumbnail was covered with flowers and seemed to resemble a typical romantic comedy, but not even 2 minutes in I was pleasantly surprised. I recommend this for everyone, even those who don't enjoy the rom-com genre.\r\nStory-9\r\nThe story is incredibly fresh and original. Featuring an androgynous main character, as well as an amazing supporting cast who the plot and storyline depend on greatly, it seems set up for the shenanigans everyone gets into.Ouran is an obvious play on other animes in the shoujo genre, but it's amazzing because of that fact; the characters aren't afraid to point out the absurdity of the episodes, with the main character (Haruhi) being well known for not understanding the other students. It's a reverse play on the stereotypical \"notice me senpai\" trope that is ever so common, and instead focuses on one more along the lines of \"please stop noticing me senpai, I'm tired.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nThe art style in this was simply gorgeous. While I'm not a fan of the typical shoujo genre, I can rewatch this anime while in the same level of awe as the first time I watched it. There are a lot of gags that blatantly point out situations, as well as imagery representing some of the many problems the characters go through. Emphasis on many.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nWhile I don't remember much of the background music, aside from Tamaki's piano, the main theme is such a catchy and well written tune that it can get me singing every time I watch this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-9\\n\r\nWhile the characters may seem to fit into the typical Shoujo stereotypes, this is completely intentional. In the first episode, they point out each character's most well-known and desired traits, and they constantly treat the genre as a joke.\\n\r\nI'm not going into depth to explain each character, but I will say this: each character has a designated trope they were designed to follow in, but each matures through the course of the show and proves that they are better than their one main strength.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this so much, Ouran is incredibly hard to beat in this category. I binge watched the entire show in two days over a holiday, and after completing it, felt the need to watch it all over again. The characters and plot draw you in, and the one season leaves you wanting more (I recommend the manga as well, it was created before the anime and continues where the anime leaves off).\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\nWhile not a perfect 10, Ouran was and probably is one of my favorite animes, even after years of others. As stated before, I honestly recommend this to anyone. If you are curious about whether or not you'll enjoy it, my one tip is to try an episode. Chances are, you'll love it.",

            "content": "I LOVED Ouran Highschool Host Club. It was highly enjoyable, and is actually one of my favorites. It's also an anime that earned a spot on my favorite dub list, which is really rare.\r\nStory-\r\nI loved the story. Haruhi breaking a vase in the Host Club room and having to dress up as a a boy to repay her debt and work for the club, only for the club to find out that Haruhi's a girl after the first episode.\r\nThe story is so carefree, yet at the same time having its serious moments.\r\nArt-\r\nI love the Ouran art style. It is quite nice and simple. A memorablestyle.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\r\nGood quality sound. At least on my standards, depending where you watch it. Crunchyroll doesn't have Ouran Highschool Host Club. I managed to get it off YouTube in both dub and sub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-\\n\r\nI loved the Ouran Highschool Host Club characters. They are memorable and unique.\\n\\n\r\nHaruhi- Known as the 'natural' in the Host Club. Haruhi is a smart character that tries to see the best in the world.\\n\\n\r\nTamaki- 'Ladies Man', 'Charmer'. Tamaki is quite the flirt. While being quite popular to the guests of the Host Club, after hours Tamaki can be quite immature and 'overreacts' when Haruhi is with other men.\\n\\n\r\nHikaru & Kaoru- Twins. The two are quite mischievous. They play around with Haruhi just to work Tamaki up. While in the Host Club, the two have a 'bromance' and make all the girls squeel.\\n\\n\r\nHoney- Ahh.. The loli-shota character. I swear, he's seventeen. Honey portrays a quite cute and young character, in reality he is much older. He enjoys sweets and cute things while being quite talented in martial arts.\\n\\n\r\nMori- Not much to say here.. Mori is the strong silent type that is there to accompany Honey. \\n\\n\r\nKyoya- Oh, man... Kyoya is the brains of the Host Club. He helps keep the club in order and not in debt. He's also the one who keeps Haruhi's debt at a view and makes it nearly impossible for her to pay it off.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- \\n\r\nWell, I said before this is now a favorite for me, so you can tell I quite enjoyed this anime. I have my fair share in shoujo anime. I enjoyed seeing the characters get along with each other and make complete fools out of each other. And when I watched the dub, I understood everything. I usually have great connections with favorite anime, and I then remembered I had watched this anime when I was younger. That making it clear why the art style, characters, opening, and major scenes were so familiar.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nI love this series. It is one worth watching. The only bad thing I see in it is the fact it cuts off at the end. It cuts off leaving the rest of the story completely oblivious. For that, it pretty much expects you to read the manga. If the rumors are true in saying that there will be a season two October 2017, the series deserves that second season. I just hope they don't end up making material that doesn't hardly connect with the first season and is not as good as the manga.",

Like most shojo, the main plot is established in the first episode and the rest of the series is the misadventures of the cast and character development, but Ouran's quirky humor and ability to make fun of itself and it's genre is what sets it apart. Ouran knows the plot is unrealistic and silly and likes to point that out. Another thing that makes Ouran different is the heroine, Haruhi, who couldn't care less about boys and looking pretty. Where most shojo heroines are pining away for some unreachable guy, Haruhi is the opposite, more concerned with herschoolwork and earning money to suport her family. For once, the heroine is the resonable one and the guys are the crazy comedic relief.",

What can I say, I finished the whole series in just one night.\r\nSTORY : 9/10\r\nI love the story, from the time Haruhi entered the Host Club room, to their wacky costumes, club events, TO the time someone FINALLY realized he's in love with her [name censored to avoid spoiler!], I enjoyed it. :) I laughed with the crazy twins, go Kya~ with Hani-senpai, the know-it-all Kyouya, the deadly silent Mori-sensei, and finally, the EVER-SLOW, but still very sweet, Tamaki Suoh.\r\nART :9/10\\n\r\nI love their chibi forms, that all I can say. And their Ouran High uniforms rock too, as they fit for being the uniform for a RICH school. :D\\n\\n\r\n(I love the way they portray Tamaki's sulky days though. XD)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND : 9/10\\n\r\n\"Sakura Kiss\" was fit for being the opening song. It was catchy, and found myself putting the song to repeat during the first few months after listening to it. :)) I'm hooked at the orchestral vibe of most of the songs in the OST, fit for the \"royal\"-like setting of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER : 10/10\\n\r\nYou'll love EVERYONE from the Host Club, even the manager herself. XD Every character has their own strength... and weakness. Not everyone's story was told here though, since the anime has only 26 episodes, but that's fine. :)\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT : 10/10\\n\r\nLike I've said earlier, I finished the whole thing fast. :)) I found myself itching for more (I go for Tamaki and Haruhi forever!) so I didn't realize I reached until the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a 9 for me. :) When my friends ask for shoujo recommendations this anime is #1 on my list. If you want to fall in love and laugh at the same time, this anime's for you. :D",

            "content": "First review. I'll try not to give too many spoilers.\r\n\tA girl surrounded by hot, rich guys, and concealing her gender to catch clients in order to pay back her debt. A school with seemingly nonexistent teachers and rules that are questionable. Some of it already sounding clich\u00e9? Yeah, it is. But it's all put together in a unique way.\r\n\tI refused to watch this for the longest time even though it was repeatedly recommended. I didn't even read the review before watching it on a random impulse. As the summary above states, \u201cUnable to repay her debt with money, Haruhi found herself with no choice butto work for the Host Club, becoming a male host herself\u201d I thought this would be about a stupid heroine easily swayed and awed by popularity and manipulated by good looks who thought her life was tragic because of the debt she had brought upon herself. I was so, so wrong.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 9/10\\n\r\n\tProbably the thing I loved the most about Ouran High was that, right when you think the story is about to get serious, sappy, or the comedy is overdone, it'd turn around and make an awesome comeback where you just have to crack up. My only problem was the ending. Even though most of our favorite animes are stopped on a dime with a completely different ending from the manga, this one was just ruined. Even if you didn't read the manga, you could tell right away when it deviated from it \u2013 when all the humor and everything you came to like about the anime just completely dies. Which is why I gave it a nine.\\n\\n\r\nART 10/10\\n\r\n\tAdmittedly, the art for the characters might leave you feeling like something is lacking, but it wasn't awkward or chaotic. I loved all the characters expressions. However, the background was done quite well; you don't feel like if you looked anywhere but at the characters you'd find things you wouldn't like. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 10/10\\n\r\n\tThe characters are the most attractive thing about the anime. Each one unique in their way, and you can't help but fall in love with all of them. All the main characters have a story to be told, and express themselves in so many different ways.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC 5/10\\n\r\n\tIt wasn't terrible, and the first song is kinda catchy.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 9/10\\n\r\n\tIt's an extremely entertaining anime, and I found myself laughing til I cried, so much that my parents were worried about me if they were around. If you're stingy about character development, perhaps it isn't the best for you to watch it. It's something that kind of happens subtlety and is hard to notice.\\n\\n\r\nSUB 9/10\\n\r\n\tThe seiyus they picked for the most important characters were excellent, especially for the main heroine and hero.",

I'll tell you why this show is the most overrated anime in the world. I'm a girl, bi, and I LOVE gender-benders... so naturally, I should love this show because Haruhi is posing as a boy, right? No... I hated it. The characters were \"okay\"... but they were all stereotypes.. and VERY typical. And the comedy? I never laughed... not once. The drama? THERE WASN'T ANY! Sure, some people will TELL you there was... but there really wasn't. I often finished an episodefeeling so bored that I could just fall asleep.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the story is terrible. The entire time, I was waiting for the story to climax... and have this HUGE twist that we wouldn't have seen coming. Alas, there wasn't one. I've watched Baka and Test, Mayo Chiki, and other nonsensical anime that I ended up loving... but this one fails, tremendously, to catch my attention.",

            "content": "Ouran High School Host Club is a show about really handsome guys making women happy. But they all hold a secret: their newest member is actually a girl. They keep the secret to themselves and must face different challenges to make sure it stays that way.\r\nIn all sense, this is practically a reverse harem. After a short while a sense of romance will be picked up by most of the club members and will constantly annoy each other by trying to advance their relationship with Haruhi, their new female club member. This goes on for quite a long time.\r\n~Characters 8/10~\r\nThe character development is quite good,seeing how they try to deepen the characters throughout each episode, leaving some episodes directly dedicated to certain club members. You'll find the usual reverse harem types: short and cute, quiet and stoic, loud obnoxious, self-interested business type and the homo twins.\\n\\n\r\nEach character possess unique skill sets allowing them to be a perfect group.\\n\\n\r\n~Story 7/10~\\n\r\nThe story is not unique and follows a lot of the basic anime school formulas, such as the beach scenes, uniforms, cosplay, bad-mouthing the poor, elaborate dresses/outfits etc... It all seems very typical.\\n\\n\r\nThe main story is basically a simple framework (or skeleton), thus allowing each character to be mend their own back stories into the main one, thickening the story and plots while helping the audience understand why the characters act the way they do.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a lot more typical and stereotypical than that, but it kept my interest in such a moe driven show.\\n\r\nIf you are wanting romance development, you can pretty much just start on episode 20.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound 9/10~\\n\r\nThe sounds, dialogue and music are not genre defining, but I really enjoyed the way they used the music. The artists used classical Mozart to get the point across in certain scenes allowing a very deep emotional connection to the current story.\\n\\n\r\n~Art 7/10~\\n\r\nAlthough, I am not a big fan of moe, this show did your typical male moe.\\n\r\nThe male beauty was not over-exaggerated which was a plus, but you can definitely tell a difference between high-class and low-class moe if you watch this show.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment 7/10~\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show for a while, but near the end of the series I found myself getting bored with the lack of romance development and especially getting bored since a lot of the same things were getting repeated. Scenes of frantic running would be continuously repeated and would drive me insane. And this show is yet another that focuses on competition and contests as a form of rivalry to win the heart of Haruhi. These contests can be very repetitive since they show up several times throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut overall, the show isn't bad, it's certainly a way to waste time, but it isn't something I'll be re-watching anytime soon.",

            "content": "This awesome reverse harem anime is a must see for all you rom-com fans! I absolutely adored this anime and must say it is one of my favourites as a big fan of rom-coms myself. \r\nSTORY- so this anime revolves around a female character named Haruhi, where due to certain circumstances needs to join the host club to pay her debt off. However, the host club full of, gorgeous and enchanting male characters needs to pretend that Haruhi is a male, the 'natural' as they as. She develops an attached relationship with the 6 members of the host club and realises that the host clubis not simply about entertaining girls with 'a lot of time on their hands' but also about others happiness. The character development is superb as each characters background is explored, and at no point does the anime get boring! \\n\\n\r\nART- although the graphics are not the best i've seen, they are not bad at all. I mean the guys are pretty hot, and Haruhi sure is kawaii! All the scenes are pretty detailed and colours are used well, it is not limited. The art is pretty typical, but i mean its not greatly old or anything. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND- the opening song sure fits the whole anime. The sound throughout is completely fine, and each voice suits the designated character. The soundtracks used throughout the anime are fitting to individual scenes and pretty nice overall. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER- the character development is great, amusing, loving and they care about each other. It's really nice to see how Haruhi's relation develops with each character, and it just keeps you wanting to see more. It's nice to see how bonds form between all the characters, and i was always excited to see if Haruhi would develop a romantic interest in a character in particular! \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT- i scored this anime a 10, because i genuinely think this anime is one of the best i've ever seen. I've been searching like crazy to find something as awesome as this! This anime has surely secured a place in my heart lol! \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL- so overall... i would highly recommend this anime to any rom-com fans, or anyone who is just looking for a light hearted anime, i absolutely loved loved loved this anime.",

            "content": "For anyone who loves a simple harem story where the girl is the main character this series is for you. The unique but simplistic story line is easy to follow and allows a watcher to still use their brains and try to guess the outcomes. comparatively, most harem stories have a twisted reason or story line that kind of takes focus off of the main characters for some time and can also cause the anime to split in different directions,sometimes,even getting off of the original stories plot.This anime reveals things as very entertaining and gradually in perfect rhythm to the story, matching the backgrounds andexpectations of the characters to a 'T\", nothing seemed rushed. The artwork probably needed a little more detail as far as HD improvement but the line and unique drawings give the characters a whimsical feel to the whole story. I especially loved it when the comparisons to common vs rich folk expectations were realized. A story as a commoner myself can relate too, specifically can register a quick nod and laugh while giving recognition to the both types of economical classes while, giving exemplary recognition of each classes problems. Another fall back though is the story line doesn't get complicated like other harems  with love triangles and lots of eye candy details ,but, if they decide to complete a second season you will bet I would be the one to watch it and see if they have the same consistency. Best part, this story is considered PG13 in my case, So its safe for a whole family of Otakus to enjoy. Happy watching :)",

This was faaaar beyond my expectations. -adjusts glasses-. \r\nAlso, spoiler free revieeeeeeew~!\r\nFor what I know Ouran High School Host Club, is the most popular reverse harem anime. It's what I believe in because this is the most recommended and talked about when you say \"reverse harem\". \r\nAnyway, I definitely recommend reading both anime and manga for they have quite some twists in it. Though, I think manga should be prioritized. \r\nBrief review pointing out what I can.\r\nAnyway. Let's get started! \r\nStory is: 9 \r\nI'd have to give it to them. They revolve around realistically and the turn of events are surprisingly good.The \"idiotic\" acts of the characters gives off a nice spice to the scenes and stuff. \\n\r\nThe story's unique and very original. I must say, this anime is not only appealing to girls, but it may be enjoyed by many. It has a really good laugh into it! \\n\r\nI'm lucky to have my own room or else my parents would've thought that I've gone crazy already...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway! Here we have the commoner scholar, Fujioka Haruhi, in Ouran High School, which is a reserved school for the wealthy and renowned students. Having troubles on finding a quiet place to study, she stumbled upon an \"abandoned\" room which is the third music room. There, she discovers that the Host Club with wealthy, gorgeous guys lies in there. Upon showing apathy, she ends up breaking a vase costing a huge amount of money. She can't possibly repay it, therefore in order to pay back, she must work as a host until the given quota is reached. (y)\\n\\n\r\nThe pace was neat. Even though occasionally it's quite slow. Although it's slow, you really wouldn't feel it if you were totally into it. I needed to restrain myself most of the time that's why I noticed (I always watch at like 2 am and stuff. ehehe..he........ '-'). \\n\\n\r\nArt is: 8\\n\\n\r\nSince it was quite an old anime, the design is a bit on the old style ones, ne? But nevertheless, the character design's definitely killing it!

The cast is very diverse personality-wise, yet each characters personality bounces perfectly off the others, leading to some great jokes and plot points. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is predictable somewhat, if you're looking for an intense anime with a rich and deep storyline this probably isn't for you, at its core the anime is comedic and does mock \"serious\" story arcs, or at least interjects comedic elements into them, this could either make the story arcs more enjoyable for you or ruin them all together, it all depends on what type of person you are. \\n\\n\r\nThe art also has a strong comedic element, which is what I found funniest about the anime, again this could go two ways, you could love it or hate it. \\n\\n\r\nI'd say definitely give it a chance, it's enjoyable and you'll probably laugh your ass off throughout it.",

            "content": "This is my third time watching Ouran High School Host Club as I was lucky enough to find it on Netflix :) I finally decided to review it so I hope it will be helpful.\r\nFor anyone that is unfamiliar with Ouran, it is about an intelligent high school student named Haruhi Fujioka who is accepted into the prestigious Ouran Academy as an honour student. Haruhi is looking for a place to study and then stumbles into the 3rd music room where the Ouran Host Club runs their club activities. There Haruhi is introduced to a group of 6 pretty rich boys who entertain female studentsafter class, headed by half Japanese, half French charmer Tamaki Suou. Haruhi is stunned by the oddness of the group and accidentally breaks an expensive vase. The story follows Haruhi, whom is dressed as a male but is revealed to be female, as she must repay the debt (caused by the broken vase) by being a member of this host club.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is a very typical shojo anime, taking advantage of common story lines such as the gender bender, the school festival, the beach episode, and common tropes/characteristics such as glittering eyes, male fan service for the ladies and bright, flamboyant colours. But what makes it unique is that it does not take itself seriously. They go over the top using typical bishounen characteristics to define the 7 \"men\" of the host club, break the laws of physics and reason, and frequently \"break the fourth wall\" by talking directly to the audience, and sometimes even referring to the anime they are in. It makes for hilarious fun. \\n\r\nMy only real complaint is the ending, as I felt it was a little rushed and felt too open-ended but that is up to interpretation. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nBoth were great. Seeing the anime on Netflix really complimented it as I was able to watch it in 1080 quality. The colours popped out more than they ever have.\\n\r\nThe music was as beautiful as I remember, using grand orchestra scores. I watched the english version and must say it is my preferred version. The voice acting was superb, with special mention to Vic Mignogna who was fantastic as Tamaki Suou. It is another great stand out performance by the same man who voiced both Dark Mousy of DNAngel and Edward Elric of the Fullmetal Alchemist series. My only complaint is the English version of the opening theme, which I just thought they could have found better singers for. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters are so unique and fun that it is hard to resist them. Every character has a chance to have their back story told, even supporting characters such as Renge, the self appointed female manager of the club, and Kasanoda, someone I won't explain but whom is my favourite supporting cast member. My stand out back stories are those of the Hitachiin twins and Kyoya Ootori (the club accountant and co-founder). These individuals became so much more fascinating and lovable once you knew their past. Tamaki and Haruhi are great leads with lovable personalities. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nFun with the right touch of drama and heart-clenching scenes, this anime's largest flaw to me was it being cut off too short.  One particular issue made to be important is never resolved in the anime, but is discussed in greater lengths in the manga. As a HUGE fan of the manga, I would highly suggest watching the anime AND THEN  following up with the manga to complete the story, as I believe it has better progression and a more resolute and satisfying ending. If you enjoyed other typical shojo animes such as DNAngel, Special A or Toradora this is a must watch. I do believe that this anime has something for everyone, including elements that men can enjoy :) But obviously, this is generally a girl's night type of anime :P",

It's random and doesn't have a particular storyline that it sticks to. Most of the episodes have random stories and they're really enjoyable. It's hard to describe the story in Ouran as it's just really random and funny. \r\nThe art is done really well. Ouran is animated by BONES and they did do an amazing job. The characters looked really well and their unique personalities shone through their looks, like theirsupposed to. There was nothing bad about the art, it was fun, creative and suited the anime. The background always looked nice and the roses always looked well. (There are a LOT of roses)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also really good. I like the opening theme, but I'm not a fan of the dubbed one. The ending theme sounds good both versions. The background music was also really good, it showed off the carefree atmosphere in the Host Club. The music never failed to fit the situation and was dramatic when it needed to be. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what make Ouran Koukou Host Club so enjoyable, the Host Club is built surrounding the hosts personalities. \\n\r\nTamaki Suoh is the princely type,\\n\r\nKyoya Ootori is the cool type,\\n\r\nHikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin are the mischievous type,\\n\r\nMitskuni \"Honey\" Haninozuka is the Boy Lolita, \\n\r\nTakeshi \"Mori\" Morinozuka is the strong, silent type\\n\r\nand Haruhi Fujioka is the natural... She's just there to repay her debt.. and to eat fancy tuna..\\n\\n\r\nEach character is unique in their own weird way but that's what makes Ouran so enjoyable. The other characters that pop up here and there are also great.\\n\\n\r\nOuran is amazing and has a lot of re- watch quality. I highly recommend it for everyone. It would also make a great first anime. \\n",

You have your chess team, baseball team and even a gentleman's club? No, you dirty mind individuals this clubs is meant to portray innocence and restore dignity and more importantly class. While that is ingenious idea for club what if such a event where to go where the idea of gentleman doesn't fully meet the new addition? Will the club disband? Will it improve? Will it make a difference in the characters lives? So many questions.\r\nI personally enjoyed this show. This show i would sayis a rare gem. For not only does it excel in the genres of romance and comedy but captures a bit of every thing else. So, one could say this anime is a jack of all trades. Another aspect i like is the nice blend in gender views. Both sides are not only considered but felt by all characters. Too many shows are meant for one gender vs another given certain 'elements' but this anime all can enjoy. As long as you willing to open your mind and heart and look beyond the feminist portrayal.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nModernly accepted art is generally what falls with in the norms. Such as is the art fully colored? was the right amount or shading or brightness applied? Was there a good balance between background and characters? Although, with this art I found had an additional feature of sparkling. Sparkling to me is when the art is grand that small elements like flowers hold the same if not more emotional/visual appearance value as gold. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nWith the idea of appearance being the high standard of this anime one will find each character has their own power. From the adorably cute childlike to the dignified intelligent. Many different forms of flowers so to type for the viewer to pick from.",

            "content": "Shoujo anime and manga are often considered to be a laughingstock in the otaku world. It is often criticised to be overly romantic, too idealistic or grimdark, sexist due to the useless heroine, and/or just being prime fujoshi bait.\r\nOuran High School Host Club takes some of these concepts and turns them on their head, while keeping the viewers interested by a good story and characters all the way through.\r\nThe story is a kind of like a cross between that of Hana Yori Dango and Hana-Kimi. A commoner girl earns a scholarship to a prestigeous academy. She stumbles upon the school's Host Club, which consists ofa group of handsome bishounen who entertain their female guests. When she accidentally knocks over an incredibly expensive vase, she is forced to join the club until she can pay for the damage... as a guy. Hilarity ensues.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are actually quite nice. Both the OP and ED are catchy as hell, and the voice acting in both Japanese and English are superb. The characters are all believable, fun and enjoyable, and we do grow to learn a lot more about them as the series goes on. I like Haruhi especially - rather than be dense, helpless and delusioned, as many shoujo heroines tend to be, she snarks at pretty much everything around her, from the wealthy lifestyle to her wacky club members. \\n\\n\r\nI did mention that this anime deconstructs a lot of particular shoujo anime conventions, didn't I? That's where a good chunk of the humour comes from - this anime is a parody of typical shoujo anime and manga. There is even a hilarious character who is an affectionate parody of female otaku/fujoshi. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this anime is incredibly enjoyable, and I highly recommend it if you're looking for a good comedy anime to lift your spirits.",

            "content": "Whether you like Anime or not, one thing I think everyone can get into is a having a good time. Who doesn't like to have fun? I sure do! And if there is one show that is a good time from beginning to end, it's Studio Bones' \"Ouran High School Host Club\". Hard to believe it's been almost exactly 10 years since this show finished airing, but it's hardly forgotten. Coming to us in the often criticized genre of \"reverse harem\" (which means a buncha guys around one girl) it destroys the barriers of it's classification and just has fun with itself.\r\nThe show's biggest strengthis it's cast of characters. Centered around a group of boys who have waaaaay too much time on their hands and choose to spend that time entertaining young ladies, they quickly grow on you and complement each other well. From the \"Princely\" Tamaki, to the Twins, to the too cool for school Kyouya, and the odd tag team that is the strong, silent Takashi and his boy child comic foil Mitsukuni (better known as \"Honey\") each has their turn in the spotlight and you get to know them as if you actually went to school together. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic for what it's going for and provides so many little comedic touches and fourth wall breaks that you'll find yourself re-watching an episode to see what you missed. The Sub vs. Dub battle is a good one with my vote going to the Japanese cast. Though, it's just as enjoyable in English. Special mention goes to the always stellar Mamoru Miyano. After enjoying him so much as Light Yagami in \"Death Note\", it's something of an odd (yet enjoyable) twist to hear him as the goofball Tamaki. Such versatility!  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this Anime a great deal. It got me through a pretty tough depression and for that it will always be among my favorites. I highly recommend this to anyone in the mood for a good laugh. 8/10. Check it out. Cheers!",

            "content": "A mere review isn't going to be able to describe my utter love and adoration for the gem that is Ouran High School Host Club, but I shall try my upmost best to disseminate my love for it to you. \r\nI watched this anime a few months back and this was only my second anime but it is the reason why I got hooked onto this world of fictional characters. I didn't really know what I was expecting when I entered Ouran, I just remembered myself LAUGHING AND LAUGHING, and I knew I wanted and NEEDED more of whatever Ouran was offering. And even thoughit's an episodic anime, meaning every episode is a stand alone, there is something about every scene that charms your heart and lures you in, and before it, you are perpetually HOOKED to everything about Ouran. \\n\\n\r\nBut of course, the best thing about Ouran is its CHARACTERS. They are precious precious and oh so dear to my heart. Unlike other reverse harems where girls become infatuated with the guys mostly due to their looks or their \"personality type\", like bad-boy or what not, Ouran does this magical thing where they present you with a distinct character trait for the boys in the host club, and at the start of the show as you try to register everyone's names, you sub-consciously associate each of them with a certain \"mould\", heck, you even just lump the twins together because they certainly do LOOK the same, and they appear to ACT the same, so perhaps they are the same? YOU CAN'T BE MORE WRONG. And Ouran certainly does teach its audience a serious lesson about stereotyping and labelling. Not in the usual \"this is only a fa\u00e7ade they're putting up, their real self lies within\" kind of thing, no no its much simpler yet so beautifully expressed. Ouran goes out of its way to justify why the boys are behaving in a certain way, be it because of their past, their family, the expectations that others and they themselves have placed on them. The seemingly comedic and dramatic characters at the start of the series suddenly seem to be a lot more relatable than we thought. \\n\\n\r\nIf you finish Ouran without falling in love with at least one of the characters, then you sir/m'am have my respect for being the most soulless anime watcher ever. Because even the female lead is extremely likeable, a far cry from your usual weak heroine that need the saving of men. Ironically, Haruhi helps the boys out with their problems, often serving the role as the mature and smart character that she is. And that's why we (including some of the boys because this is a reverse harem after all) love her to bits! But fortunately (or unfortunately, depends on how you see it), the Ouran anime doesn't focus on romance that much because the boys are still confused over their feelings for Haruhi and so they build up something that is equally, if not more important then love, and that is friendship. And that's what makes the chemistry between the characters so incredibly fabulous, with hilarity ensuing at every other scene. (Most of which stems from the host club king and my fave, Tamaki) I guarantee Ouran will have you laughing till your insides burst out. The jokes are so funny that upon rewatching them for the umpteen time, I still myself giggling a little. \\n\\n\r\nMy ouran journey was such a joy, and I kinda regret finishing the anime in a mere 2 days (I couldn't stop myself), but Ouran is so amazing that I've rewatched it twice now, with each time etching new scenes into my head and heart forever. \\n\\n\r\nThis \"review\" isn't even really a review, but rather my experience with Ouran, my favourite anime. I really do hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ouran High School Host Club Review (NO SPOILERS)\r\nAs much as I love anime, I tend to be VERY late to the party, with a lot of shows. It mainly has to do with me not even really knowing what anime was, until like, 2011. So a lot of those LEGENDARY shows that are an absolute necessity to watch, I've either only recently seen them, or are still planning to do so. One of these shows... is Ouran High School Host Club.\r\nI had heard about this show, in the past. But I didn't really pay it much mind, because it didn't really seem like my thing.But man, do people rave about this series!. At first, I was just like \"Is it a fan service show?\" \"Is it just a girl's show?\" Well, I'm very ashamed in myself for thinking those things. Because after all the different types of anime that I've seen, there is one lesson I've learned that is VERY clear. That lesson is this: In anime... there is NO SUCH THING as a \"boy's show\" or a \"girl's show\". Not. At. All. Anime is for everyone. It doesn't fear taking risks and breaking molds and boundaries. Absolutely everyone can get something out of some sort of anime. There's something for everyone, out there. And if a certain anime isn't for you, it'll never be for a reason as trivial as it being \"too girly\". So let's stop beating around the bush and talk about this show. First off, is this show worth all the hype that it's gotten? I'll answer that right now. Yes. Absolutely, 100% yes. \\n\\n\r\nI seriously cannot stress enough how near perfect this show is. From Episode 1, I am immediately drawn in with the entire world and its characters. And there are a lot of shows in this genre that I very much enjoy. But there's always at least one or two episodes that I don't like watching. Ouran doesn't have that. I thoroughly enjoyed each and every single episode. Each one has both hilarity that never gets old, as well as deep and engaging character development. That's where this show really shines. Its characters. They are SOOOOOOO deep! You're never done learning about them and you end up loving them, with every single passing moment. They're not perfect people. But they have very admirable qualities that often surprise you. They also go through a lot of growth and understanding of other people's feelings. I was not expecting that, from this show. Whenever an episode would come up, where the topic would be to make fun of a certain thing, usually a person's appearance or personality. At first, I would be a bit turned off, thinking the whole episode would just be making fun of these sort of things that I've had personal experience with, just because some sorts of people think it's funny. But as the episode progressed, you saw that some of the characters didn't go along with those sorts of performances. They'd actually speak up and make others aware of how some of these \"jokes\" can be quite hurtful. And when it comes from characters that you think would just be one dimensional boy toys, it's really powerful, seeing just how unpredictable these people are.\\n\\n\r\nTamaki was probably my favorite one, out of the bunch. He could've easily had a constantly bratty and demanding personality, who never cared or even noticed when they were hurting others. But in as early as the first episode, they show you that he isn't that kind of a person. He has a conscience. A DEEP one. He cares very deeply for his friends and for common courtesy and respectful behavior, towards other people. I think the right word would be... impressed. This show, and its characters, very much impressed me, with just how deep and civil they all were. And the whole cast is like that. Ya, all of them have that one defining trait. But they all have stories and emotion and shifting feelings. This is honestly one of the deepest and most enjoyable cast of characters I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. The ONLY character I didn't like in this show, as well as the only THING I didn't like about this show, overall, was Renge. I thought she'd just be a \"one episode only\" character, but she wound up being a recurring one, for reasons I still don't quite understand. I honestly don't think she adds anything at all to the show, with her presence, past her introductory episode. And even still, the best part of that episode was when they shot her down, for her less than pleasurable ideals. She's the one and only complaint I have about this show. And honestly... that's pretty impressive.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't anything mind-blowing. It doesn't look old, as it was made in 2006. And we all know how seller anime looked in 2006. I'd more so be willing to call its design stylized, rather than simple. Whether or not people would agree with me on that, I cannot say. Probably the most shocking thing about the animation is that it was done by.... Studio Bones... That's just cool, to me. I really like how anime companies don't really have all much of a set in stone style, to them. Some of them do, of course. But I'm really happy that I can look forward to being surprised, with whatever it is I'm looking at, whenever it comes to anime. A lot of people say anime all looks the same, but that can't be farther from the truth. Look at shows like Cowboy Bebop, Clannad, Attack on Titan, and Ouran, all side by side. And try telling me that all anime looks the same. Or sounds the same, for that matter. Which leads me to my next topic: Ouran's music. For the regular tracks, it's all very nice. Nothing too mind blowing, that I can remember, after the show is over, now. BUT THE OPENING! MAAAAAAAN, THE OPENING! If you don't get addicted to that opening, the SECOND you hear it, I don't know what to tell you! THAT is a good opening theme song. And so is the ending theme song, which is quite a rarity to even say!\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the classic sub vs dub debate. Honestly, after hearing how much praise was sung about this show, by the english voice actors and its fans, I absolutely had to go with the dub, on this one. And it is by far one of the best dubs I've heard. The only voice I had a problem with was with, big surprise, Renge. I don't know, it may just be because I'm use to hearing that voice attached to much younger girls, like Amy from Case Closed or May Chang from Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. But whatever. It's a minor nitpick. That Japanese is pretty spot on, too. And this show does have a lot of Japanese text that pops on the screen, throughout each episode. It's all just a bunch of titles, along with some flavor text. None of it is necessary to read, but I would've liked if they had edited it, for the English release. It's really not a big deal though, trust me. The Japanese did a great job, but seriously. The English voice cast NAILED this one. And they LOVE this show, just as much as its fans do. So seriously. For this show, dub. All the way.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly wish I did a full, in depth review on every single episode. Every one of them has merit, in both surprising you with its characters and engaging you with its story and lessons. I absolutely ADORED this show, from beginning to end. My only worry now, is that any slice of life show I watch after this won't be able to top it. But if there's one thing anime is good at, it's surprising people. So I'm excited for what the future holds, for my viewing pleasure. And I very happy, in the hear and now, for getting to meet and experience some of the greatest characters in any anime, I've seen. This show is a masterpiece. There's no other way of putting it. I can 100% recommend it to anyone and everyone. Whether it's to surprise you with something you haven't seen before. Or to just make you feel good, with the kindness and friendly characters this show has to offer. This show came to me at a very good time. It helped me feel good about life, and friendships, in general. I feel I was able to better understand some of my own friends, because of it. And I'm very grateful to this show, for that.\\n\\n\r\nOuran High School Host Club... gets a 9/10",

            "content": "This show is a blast right from the first line. With the narrator's sarcasm and the main character being the equivalent of a Disney character bewildered by all the singing, you have 26 episodes of adorable rose petal strewn fun.\r\nThis series knows what it is, and behaves like a Lifetime movie that laughs at itself.\r\nThe story isn't all that plot driven, it focuses on developing the characters and displaying their antics. It has a ton of cute fluff and humor, ridiculous rich boys and a down to earth girl navigating high school and this fun little playground they have created.\r\nThe art isn't the ABSOLUTE BESTI've ever seen, but I personally did like it, and it served its purpose. It was soft, fluttery, and shoujo-esque, with a pretty, flowery color scheme. The scenery never looked awkward and CGI like some sceneries look. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty much the same as the art in my opinion. It had a really cute opening, that gets you singing along pretty fast. It's flowery, pretty, and buttercream icing-y.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were probably my absolute favorite part of the show. Starting out as hilarious overblown stereotypes of their own doing, through their adventures, interactions with Haruhi and each other, they begin to relearn themselves and become better people. Their sometimes-clashing personalities and sometimes-idiocy makes for some humorous and really sweet developments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved this show. It made me laugh, cry, ooh and ahh, and was an easy show to sit back and enjoy some popcorn with.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for fluffy fun with cute characters and some Flynn Ryder-esque confusion over Tamaki's (Rapunzel's) antics, you're in for a treat.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 10/10 for enjoyment, 4/5 stars for quality.",

Go back and watch something you thought you really liked a decade later. See if it still holds up. I went back and watched Inuyasha (still love it, by the way), and I hated Miroku this time, when I used to love him. As we progress as a culture and race, some characters and animes just don't hold up.\r\nAnyway, I digress.\r\nAs a 30-something Olivia watching Ouran High School Host Club, I found it SILLY. And not even in the fun andfunny way. It's silly in the roll your eyes and sigh way. \\n\\n\r\nAs I watched each episode, I could actually FEEL the valuable time I was wasting and could likely be doing something else with. I didn't even make it all the way through--about half way was enough. \\n\\n\r\nI'll keep it short. All the characters (except for Haruhi) are so incredibly self absorbed that I found it really difficult to focus on anything else after a while. Everyone was SO selfish--and it wasn't funny! Was it supposed to be funny? Twenty-something Olivia found this funny. I  have no clue as to why. A bunch of completely self-absorbed pretty boys forcing a young woman to take part in their ridiculous antics because of her low economic status... ha... ha ha...? There's not even any discernible plot to speak of.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, lovely; Music, catchy; Funny, no.

The title, as well as the descriptive capsule Netflix provided, weren't very promising, yet it was still highly rated, so I figured, \"What the hell; I'll check it out.\"\r\nI almost immediately regretted it, and almost didn't make it through the first episode; it was like watching an episode of \"Three's Company\" being performed by the \"Three Stooges.\"\r\nThe characters are initially two-dimensional stereotypes. The early episode plots seem rather pedestrian.\r\nAnd yet, somewhere in there things shift fairly subtly. The characters, while superficially two-dimensional, start to show hidden depths of character. The plots, seemingly without purposeor reason, somehow begin to have subtle relevance to the hidden depths of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nIn its own way, Ouran High School Host Club works on multiple levels. It presents as a straightforward pandering to certain anime stereotypes. On another, it deliciously skewers and playfully mocks those self same stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on yet another, it almost completely deconstructs those stereotypes, showing us a group of young friends, seemingly \"On Top Of The World\" and quite at ease with their wealth and privilege, who set out to playfully \"Host\" at their high school.\\n\\n\r\nYet each has their own emotional problems and hangups that are, somehow, seemingly relatable, as seen through the eyes of \"everyday commoner girl\" and audience surrogate Haruhi Fujioka. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the series, I was no longer seeing ANY of the characters as mere stereotypes, and was instead rooting for them as individuals as they each in turn confronted and overcame personal and familial obstacles, and watched fondly as they learned that instead of being mere cordial acquaintances, they were all fire-forged friends, closer in many cases than family. \\n\\n\r\nGive it a shot, and stick with it through the earlier episodes.

Art style? Nah, not my thing. One of the biggest reasons I didn't watch this right away (because I knew it was supposed to be good) was because I cannot stand watching art styles that make me cringe. I'm very picky. There's a line I have, and Host Club was pushing it. Other than the art, I kind of felt like this anime was a slow starter. Most anime like this are becausethey have to spend some time setting up the premise and establishing everybody's personalities and relationships, but either way, this anime took a hot minute to get into. Beyond that, some of the episodes felt sort of disconnected. Most didn't, but every once in a while, I'd be like, \"why is this episode here?\" \\n\\n\r\nOkay, that's all the bad. Essentially, it was just a bit boring to begin with until I came to love the characters. Let me tell you, it didn't take long. The way these characters are written, it's like they're addictive. A big culprit of that is the astounding voice actors. Miyano Mamoru, especially, gave such life to his character. We all know he's amazing as a seiyuu, but this role specifically was something special. Before I knew it, I was hooked on them, and I wanted to know everything I could about their pasts.\\n\\n\r\nThat gives me a good opportunity to start talking about the story because these characters' depth is amazing. It's definitely not something you'd call \"realistic\" as this anime is definitely... Well, let's just say it's in a genre of it's own. However, once you enter the world, the story that's told through these people is actually quite intense at times. So, once you start getting to know who the characters are and how that affects their attitudes in the present, the story gets really interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, if you're thinking about watching this anime, just do it. In my opinion, it's worth the hype. At the same time, I do feel like you're going to love it or hate it, but the chances are pretty good that you're gonna love it. If nothing else, I'm glad I can say I've ticked this classic off of my \"to watch\" list. \\n\\n\r\nNow, on to the manga.",

It's the characters. This is probably the only anime (or one of the only ones) that combines comedy and drama perfectly. You'd think you couldn't have a little touching moment in a comedy? Think again. The elements of this anime are combined so smoothly and perfectly.\r\nSome of the characters develop quitea bit through the course of the show, while others take only small steps in the direction of change. Some have somewhat difficult back-stories, others not as much.

It's founded on anime/high school stereotypes, yet each character has a bit more depth to them than previously anticipated. Plus it tastefully handles gender issues as well, without overstepping too many boundaries.\r\nAlso, this show is downright hilarious. It could be called Hijinks: the Show. There are many goofy moments that will have you giggling at how lovable and silly some of these people are - especially the head of the Host Club. And yet, the show dares to try and have somemore emotional parts. In other shows that would be a complete failure, but in this case, it somehow works. Perhaps it's due to good storytelling and character development, or perhaps the makers just got lucky. Whatever the case, I own the full show on dvd and I'm not sorry at all.",

It's very interesting to see how all them grow up as the anime goes on.\r\nAlthough this is a comedy anime, there are really drama moments that let you see the real characters' soul. It's so touching.\r\nI have watched a lot of animes and this one is totally in my top 10 of ''animesI have enjoyed most'' and in my top 5 of ''funniest animes''.\\n\\n\r\nBut I want a second part of this anime!

            "content": "As a lighthearted pseudo romantic comedy with sparks of emotional depth and meaning, this is a great anime across the board. Perhaps some might be too quick to designate this show as childish or haughty, but deep down it's neither. -Ok, actually it could be a little haughty with its aristocratic humor-. But that aside, the art and the characters alone make this a great series, and the story keeps things lighthearted and fun, with occasional moments of beautiful honesty and emotion. \r\nArt: I loved how emotions were portrayed with quick cuts to dramatic and over-the-top illustrations, perfectly timed with a musical crescendo. This stylereally shows why anime is such a unique and special form of artistic expression. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters have been well thought out, each of them unique to not only one another, but to anime characters in general. This is really a unique cast of characters. I found them all likable, and their back story intriguing. \\n\\n\r\nStory: The show doesn't go for any grandiose narrative, many of the episodes involve trivial objectives, which become all the more exciting because of the melodramatic nature of the cast. However there is a plot that slowly unfolds and ultimately adds meaning to the overall story. Really what I liked was that I could enjoy any scene, regardless of the plot, simply  because the artistry was incredible, and the characters were so uniquely entertaining. As the title implies, you really do learn a thing or two about being a great host.",

            "content": "Alright! \r\nAs a girl who does not like shoujo anime/manga...it is very hard for me to even bring myself to watching one from this genre; even so when it is labelled with HAREM!!! I just really don't like harem...original or reversed -I dislike BOTH.\r\nHowever, OHSHC by my opinion should not be tagged with that genre...and it is by far my most favourite shoujo anime/manga EVER! From the great characters to facepalm-at-rich-snobby-brats moments, I adore this anime.\r\nStory|\r\nI deduct a point from the story since...it gets a little predictable at a certain point but that does not mean I didn't find it hilarious~ The basic summary ofthe whole story is how Fujioka Haruhi leads her life as a normal 'commoner' in the world of the 6 rambunctious and good-looking princes and falls for one of them. What I like about this anime so much is that despite being surrounded by 6 rich guys, it does not focus on how each guy falls for her unlike other harem-based animes. Sure there are a couple of them who falls for her but the main focus is on the main pair instead of having the one heroine receiving endless love from multiple guys. It's realistic to have at least one or two guys falling for one girl but when it exceeds that number, that's the part where I'd just push the anime far far from my sights. \\n\r\nOkay, enough about the harem-rant...I find story overall ridiculously humorous with bits and pieces of drama that I can accept. However, the main focal point that sets the story in its place of originality is definitely the characters which I'll talk about later but as of now, I love the story so 9/10~\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound |\\n\r\nI'll just talk about both of these in one paragraph...\\n\r\nThe art is not mindbogglingly amazing, but not at all bad in any way. I find the art style to be very light-hearted and it matches with the whole romantic-comedy feel of the anime. The settings can sometimes be very well done which I find that there is still effort to the art of this anime. What I find most to my liking is how the art never contradicts the emotion of the moment; when it is serious, it doesn't clash with the seriousness and when it's comedic, it goes with the whole humorous flow~ I can't really say much but despite being VERY picky towards the art-style of an anime, I like OHSHC's just fine...\\n\r\nThe sound...well, the opening is very addictive... I mean, REALLY ADDICTIVE. I find myself singing along to the opening instead of skipping it as I always do with other animes... I like it that much..haha! I think the OST fits pretty well with the anime and the whole 'royal' sounding music makes the rich guys sound more and more like princes instead of just sons and heirs of a rich family. I do appreciate the music to really bring the comedic moments to life because...I just think that the background music explains a certain emotion best so it did well by my opinion~ So overall for both areas, I give them 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter |\\n\r\nOh~ my most favourite part of this anime~\\n\r\nI don't even have to explain to how PERFECT Mamoru Miyano voiced Tamaki~ It's biased I know but I just adore how he always catches the personality of his character and brings them to life and in this case, Tamaki is probably the light of the whole anime...it's lovely to see how the 'King' of the club is the one being bullied and have pranks pulled upon him; yet, he maintains his status by showing consideration and affection for not only the heroine, but his club members as well.\\n\r\nNow, I don't mind when an anime focuses totally on the main pair; I mean...it's a shoujo anime... DUH. But this is why OHSHC is such an irresistable anime...not only do we get to appreciate the main pair's developing relationship but also the other character's growth as well; AND, they do not depend on the main girl to have their own development. In some episode, Haruhi barely does anything and instead, the story focuses on a certain character. I find this to be very refreshing and realistic because...come on...why on earth would 6 guys need one girl to have a change in their lives right?\\n\r\nSo yeah...nothing more to say~ 10/10~!\\n\\n\r\nBy now, you probably can tell that I really enjoyed this anime and YES. I do. I can re-watch this anime forever and never get bored of it...hahaha! I think I've re-watched this anime completely for about 8 times and as I'm writing this review, I feel like re-watching it again so THAT'S how much I enjoyed it! 9/10 for enjoyment and overall, I think this is a shoujo anime that stands out on its own in this genre. So do give it a try and be amazed by all its ridiculous humour and face-palming moments...I know I did~ ^_^",

            "content": "Ouran High School Host Club is a 26 episode shojo anime aired in 2006. It was directed by Takuya Igarashi and produced by the animation studio bones. \r\n  ~STORY~\r\nThe story of this anime is very original and refreshing. There are basically little to no plot holes, and the character backgrounds are explained quite well. The plot of the anime while commendable, it rather small, so this anime relies mostly on story. The story is never boring and though sometimes predictable, it never fails to entertain. \r\n~ART~\r\nThe animation was done by one of my favorite studios, Bones. The animation quality is quite spectacular. The colorsare very bright, and the animation is consistent throughout the series. The character designs are very unique and lively. One thing I also found quite good is that the backgrounds are always very detailed. Never does the animation seem bland or of poor quality. \\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~\\n\r\nThe music for this anime was done by Yoshihisa Hirano. While the name may not sound familiar, the music for this show is simply brilliant. The soundtrack consists of a lot of classical sound music, which fits with the elegant theme of the Host Club. The opening is also one of my personal favorites. With upbeat and catchy music, it fits quite well. I personally didn't have as much as a problem with the English dub cover of the opening as some people did, although I do prefer the original Japanese version. The ending is also quite catchy, although if I had to choose between the two I would probably pick the opening. The voice acting for this show is top notch, in both the Japanese and English versions. The voices all fit the characters well. I believe the English dub is one of Funimation's best. The actors portray their characters perfectly. \\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTERS~\\n\r\nThe characters are probably one of the best aspects of this show. They are all original and unique in their own way, and you simply never get tired of them. I especially enjoyed the main character Haruhi, because she's very different from most shojo protagonists. Every important character gets a fair amount of screen time, and the way they interact is simply hilarious. \\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this show immensely. I was never bored watching it, and I found myself craving more at the end of every episode. Thus, I was quite disappointed when I finished the last episode. \\n\\n\r\n~OVERALL~\\n\r\nI give this anime an easy 10 out of 10. If you've looked at my profile, it's quite easy to tell this is my favorite anime series ever. It's done very well in every aspect, and I recommend it to everyone, even those who don't enjoy shojo.",

            "content": "This is rather an unusual anime for me. Typically, I would have a particular delightment for deep psychological and philosophical anime with blood, morbid, gore and violence but this is quite an exquisite piece of literature. \r\nStory (9/10)\r\nThe story was quite exaggerated which gives it its own unique style but at the same time it will give you moments where it will pull your heartstrings. The mixture of over the top and stereotypical comedy, friendship and serious heart throbbing moments were in unmarred harmony. If there is something problematic with the story, then it\u2019s the annoying uncalled for scenes of an annoying character. \r\nArt (8/10)\r\nThecharacter designs are not that original but the only thing good about the art is their overwrought shots of some kind of girlish fantasy that well-suited the story and the characters personality.  \\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, when I first heard the intro, my head assumed that this is a typical girly girl romance; one girl and six other guys fighting over her, henceforth, it sends some confusing message to the viewers, perhaps to attract more viewers who are very drawn to this kind phenomenon? But in the end, the song has a catchy feel to it. Other than that, the music within the show itself perfectly depicts a stereotypical high-class person wherein in history are the handful of people who are able to afford seats in a theater house to watch dramas and operas. The sound effects and background music were well-picked and were in sync with a specific scene.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the driving force of the story. Their personalities where very much differentiated and still stick to its theme of an exaggerated stereotypical anime. It is also rather ironic for the characters themselves explain some of the stereotypes done within the show. In the end, the exaggerated stereotypical characters went into full bloom and demonstrated another side which caused a more dramatic and near serious scenery; from a typical cool analytic nerd to a perv-like persona, from a narcissist to a person with a big sharing heart, from a mischievous personality to a deep wounded heart, from fiercesome martial arts master to an innocent child.  \\n\\n\r\n*Overall, the anime is worth watching and beautifully pieced together. After watching something dark or perhaps serious, this is something that will help loosen up a twisted mind.  \\n",

Kyouya scares me but is more amusing then any of the other characters combined. 'Mommy and Daddy' are the best thing sence sidewalk chalk...or something (el oh el)\r\nIf you like random sterotypical lovely characters,amazing art andoveral enjoyment then watch it!!!\\n\\n\r\nBy the way,....Can someone tell me where I can buy the Japanese drama CD's?

            "content": "\u2661 \"Kiss Kiss Fall In Love\" \u2661 \r\nWhen I first stumbled upon this anime, I thought that this anime was just the stereotypical love story where the popular boy falls in love with a shaggy, unpopular girl. It sort of does, but this wonderful anime which follows the popular 'boy mistaken for a girl' idea stars Haruhi, a 'commoner' who winds up at the elite school with Ouran Academy due to a scholarship.\r\nCharacters and their Developments: \r\nThe characters of this anime are very well developed despite the fact that at the beginning they are mostly set with a stereotypical sort of idea, but as youprogress through the season, you will find that there is new perky traits of each host as you come along.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, the 'prince' Tamaki is actually a perceptive, empathetic leader who comes off as an idiot (but there is actually more to him than meets the eye); Hikaru and Kaoru, the two, mischevious demon twins who enjoy a good prank or two who uses their 'twincest' to appeal to girls; Kyoya, the money-minded Shadow Lord who cares about profit as much as if it was life; Honey, the loli-shota obsessed with his sweets, and his loyal friend, Mori, the silent stoic type. Haruhi herself is more of the bookish type and is immune to the host's charms, yet becomes entangled (in a very light) love triangle, which is vaguely resolved in the end of the series. \\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to relate to and you will find (just like I did) that you will fall in love with pretty much all the characters and not just one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is just impeccable - the creators didn't go over the top with what they were doing, mixing the rich and royal and balancing the norm just right! I don't understand why some people would dislike the animations - they do look much different from the way that they were drawn in the manga - but to me (personally) I found that they looked much better!\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely adored it! It didn't concetrate so much on the romantic side of things that I would feel stuffed and feel like switching off the tv screen. If you don't particurlarly enjoy romance too much like I do, you don't need to worry about that in this anime! OHSHC mostly focuses on the comedic sides of things, and I found myself laughing my head off in the most inappropriate of times (like at midnight when I wasn't supposed to be up.)\\n\\n\r\nRecommendations:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to pre teens or early teens like ( from 12 up, preferably 13). It seems like a show more aimed for girls but I gave it for my guy friends to watch and they loved it, so hey! Lets not be stereotypical! I personally read the manga and I found that it followed the plot quite well, but skipped a lot of parts, but still overall made a great impression on me. OHSHC is actually one of my top animes and one of my first. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ouran High School Host Club is another add-on to the romantic comedy genre of anime, but unlike many others, this takes a bit of a different approach. Instead of \"finding true love\" as many romantic stories have in mind, this anime centers on a girl having to do chores for a guy club after accidentally stumbling upon them. \r\nPROS\r\nThe animation in Ouran High School Host Club is quite unique. It has pretty much every bright color you can think of. Dark colors, such as brown and black, are barely ever seen. This can be an upside or downside to the viewer, depending on what you'relooking for. I rather enjoyed the visuals, although it took some time to get used to. The cuteness factor of the show is what drags a lot of people in after the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nAs said before, the story is pretty unique compared to other romance anime stories, but it isn't anything special. I guess I have to give the story credit for being as original as it is, despite my mixed feelings towards it. Originality is a key factor that I'm sure most look for in anime, and the story here, while a bit \"meh\", is original. \\n\\n\r\nAll the characters in this anime are very interesting and unique. I feel like anyone who watches this series will target one character throughout the series that they will like the most (although all of them are likeable). For me, it was Honey because he just seemed so joyful and full of life whenever a plot centered on him. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy here is as good as a show like this can be. Lots of laughs happen throughout the series, although things get a bit more dramatic near the end, but it doesn't go off the deep end or anything. If you love to laugh, this would be the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nCONS\\n\\n\r\nI can't really think of many cons to this anime. I guess I wish there were more episodes or a second season, but I'm sure that won't happen in the future. \\n\\n\r\nI scored the sound used in the anime as a 7. It isn't anything special. I mean, this is a romantic comedy. It's used the way it should be.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nOuran High School Host Club is an anime that you need to watch if you love cuteness and laughter. It's a unique, but at times, predictable story that is fun for whoever wants to try it out. I personally love it.",

It is full of comedy and you will grow really attached to the characters. Trust me the first time i tired to watch this show i only made it passed the opening then i turned it off and said \"No way am i watching this\"\r\nA year later i decided to give it another chance and let me say it is one of my favorite animes ever! There is really no story plot but there is a storyinvolved and it all ties in together in the last two episodes. The ending was great probably my favorite. This show is really unique i love it alot.\\n\\n\r\nAlso for the people who dont want to watch it because they think it is a romance anime there really isnt alot of romance, only a couple episodes but they dont focus on it. So everyone give this anime a try with an open mind and im sure you wont regret it :)",

            "content": "Story \r\n 9/10\r\nHaruhi Fujioka is a scholarship student at the prestigious Ouran Academy, a fictitious high school located in Bunkyo, Tokyo. Looking for a quiet place to study, Haruhi stumbles upon the Third Music Room, a place where the Ouran Academy Host Club, a group of six male students, gathers to entertain female \"clients\". During their first meeting, Haruhi accidentally knocks over and breaks an antique vase valued at \u00a58,000,000 (US$80,000 in the U.S. English manga)[1] and is told to repay the cost in service to the club. Haruhi's short hair, slouching attire and gender-ambiguous face cause her to be mistaken by the hosts fora male student. The hosts all agree that Haruhi would be a good host, thus making her join the host club. Ultimately she agrees to join the Club as a host herself (dressed as a male) in order to pay off her debt.[2] She agrees to join since she does not mind hosting as long as she can pay the debt off faster. The hosts do later find out that she is, in fact, a girl. They keep this a secret, so no one will be able to tell. The Ouran Private Academy encompasses kindergarten to twelfth grade (along with a university). Most students come from wealthy families, but in special cases, merit scholarships are granted to exceptional students from a lower income bracket. The school's unofficial motto is \"Lineage counts first, wealth a close second,\" meaning students with stellar family backgrounds but low socioeconomic status may be given top priority over those from rich families with lesser pedigrees. \\n\\n\\n\r\n*Copied from Wikipedia \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very unique and special. I actually started watching this Anime only because it was so different from any other Harem Anime. \\n\r\nI love the story line and how each character evolves as the story progresses. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\r\n 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIt suits the anime. It's simple no overly extreme. It has a touch of humor to it and so it's nice to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\n 9/10\\n\\n\r\nReally good sound effects. Suits the mood and contributes to the overall charm of the Anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\n 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nHaruhi is supposed to be the 'natural charmer'in the host club. Which is really funny she she is actually a girl and other girls are charmed by her. \\n\\n\r\nThe other members of the club consist of the president Tamaki Suou, a student who treats Haruhi like she is his own daughter and is hugely jealous of anyone else who approaches her; Kyoya Otori, the bespectacled calculating vice-president who serves as the brains of the club; Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin, a pair of mischievous identical twins who like playing tricks on the other club members and playing up a homoerotic angle on their relationship; Mitsukuni \"Honey\" Haninozuka (\"Hunny\" in the manga), a small, cute boy who has a great passion for stuffed animals and eating cakes; and Takashi \"Mori\" Morinozuka, a tall, quiet boy who is protective of Honey. All the characters are parodies of shojo manga characters, with Haruhi serving as the \"natural\" type, Tamaki as the \"princely\" type, Kyoya as the \"cool\" type, the Hitachiin twins as the \"little devils\", Honey as the \"cute shotacon\" type, and Mori as the \"strong, silent type\". \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really very good. They were able to take different genres of manga and make characters out of them which I liked. \\n\r\nEach character had some hidden past that shaped the way they turned out to be. \\n\r\nI liked how they were able to help each other overcome their problems and finally become something that resembled a family.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\n 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought this Anime is pretty good if you just want to relax and have some fun.I especially like that the motto of the Host Club is aimed at making the customers who come there happy. \\n\r\nIt's a touching anime and will make you a kinder person after watching it. \\n\\n\r\nLoved the ending, it had a sense of completeness and you feel a great deal of satisfaction after finishing it.\\n",

            "content": "This anime is one that I can watch over and over again and not ever get bored. I watch it on Netflix all the time. \r\nBut lets talk about why shall we? \r\nThe story: 9/10\r\nThe story follows Haruhi Fujioka, a first year at Ouran Academy. After making it there on a full scholarship, Haruhi's goals are to be a lawyer much like their late mother. However, while looking for a quiet place to study, Haruhi stumbles upon the Ouran Host Club, and also stumbles upon a very expensive vase, shattering it into pieces and is thrown into an 8 million yen debt. Now, Haruhi mustwoo over one thousand girls to pay back the debt. However, Haruhi is actually a girl herself! This quirky school comedy follows the struggles of each member of the infamous Ouran Host Club. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty solid. It's unique, and fun. It kind of set the bar for school stories. That's probably why I enjoy it so much. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: Both 9/10. \\n\r\nThe art is unique and a lot of fun. The artists really had a blast drawing each scene and you could tell. Funimation and the Japanese seiyuus also give these characters distinct voices and personalities. I'm a dub fan in anime, but the sub is undeniably good as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nThese characters are so good. Being a reverse harem, you would figure Haruhi's character is just there as a place holder for the viewer to place themselves in, giving them the ability to be with any character of their choosing. This usually means the female lead is bland or boring. Haruhi however is not. She's independent, to the point where she has very limited social skills, she's smart, she's beautiful, and she sticks up for her friends and those she believes in. \\n\\n\r\nThe male cast around her is good as well. They are not just some pretty faces. The anime does a good job diving into each characters past and psyches. You see each one grow with the help of Haruhi's non-bias and motherly guidance. Not only that, but they boys help out Haruhi. They teach her how to be social again, and how to depend on others. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are good too. They all have episodes dedicated to their stories and you feel for each one, wanting them to succeed. \\n\\n\r\nIt truly is a great cast of characters. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is beautiful. It's funny, it's sad, it's heartwarming. Sure, the last two episodes stray from the manga, but that only encourages people to go READ the manga. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone should watch this. It's a great gateway into anime, and it's just a lot of fun.",
