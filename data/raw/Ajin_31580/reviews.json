            "content": "\u201cAjin\u201d is the \u201cBatman: Arkham Knight\u201d (PC) of anime.\r\nThis show is broken. The show visually assaults your eyes. Visuals are important in visual entertainment. Dismissing visuals in visual entertainment is like dismissing food at a restaurant. You may be influenced to go somewhere because the service rocks, but you won\u2019t go if the food is horrible. The visuals are incompetent at best. I\u2019m going to put this in terms that many people on this site will understand. Some gaming companies restrict games to 30 frames per second (FPS) because they want their game to be more \u201ccinematic\u201d. People complain that games below 30 FPS isnot suitable for many games. Frame rates under 30 FPS is regarded as a sign of lacking quality. \u201cAjin\u201d took this concept of low frames as being cinematic and ran with it. They tried to be super cinematic with frame rates dipping below 10 FPS. In scientific terms, this does not even pass the critical flicker fusion frequency. Human eyes/brains register 24 FPS as a fluid motion. Movies are usually shot in 24 FPS and repeat frames to synthesize a 30 FPS motion.  Please have the courtesy of doing a little research and finding out what the bare minimum is for entertainment targeted for humans. This is the first time I have ever had a headache after watching something. The manga has more frames per second than this horrible adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is so horribly animated that the studio acknowledges their professional impotence. I\u2019m not talking about how the 5th episode is deservedly named \u201cTrash\u201d. Although in that episode Satou regenerated an arm, pulled his arm out from under him, and shot a dude in a literal 1 frame. In chapter 19 of the manga, Satou was supposed to fly a plane into the building. They knew they couldn\u2019t animate an airplane smoothly so they gave us a different alternative. We got an explosion and Satou riding the building down. The concept of him riding the building down was legit, but it is wrong. People will argue that the animators were being sympathetic towards Americans by not showing the plane like how Pok\u00e9mon did, but there is another scene where the animators pushed the action out of the scene. Earlier in the series, a train hit a car and pushed the car out of the frame so they could blow the car up without having to animate it.  There was a helicopter that blew up off screen because effort is too much to ask for. If the animators cared about their \u201cart\u201d they would not allow the \u201cplease buy our DVD/Blu-ray\u201d halfway through every episode. This ad goes on for a full minute and takes up nearly half the screen. There are reasons that this advertisement doesn\u2019t show up in other shows. Any self-respecting animator would be outraged by the blanketing of their animation. People try to defend CG when it is poorly executed in shows they like, but that is being a zealot. Quality doesn\u2019t have sacrificed because the animation style is being experimented with. Over 2 decades ago Aardman Animation, the studio that brought us the British anime \u201cWallace and Gromit\u201d, has made clay move far smoother than CG because Aardman Animation actually cares about their work and puts time into their art. \\n\\n\r\nThe show does deserve some credit. The orchestrated pieces are put perfectly in place. I like Japanese Justin Timberlake in the intro song. The creators of this show are probably good with the ladies, because the mood is set for every scene. Satou is a great bad guy. He wants the world to burn and he has a great personality. You understand his rage and malcontent with how humans have treated him and he wants back at them. The show is best when Satou is around. The story is awesome. Everyone who has seen the anime or read the manga will agree that the story is cool. Corrupt government, explosions, stands (black ghosts), and Satou are all great things to have in a storyline. Great job on the story for knowing who is interesting and when they are interesting. Most people watch stuff for the main character, but Kei takes a backseat in the story so the show can focus on the larger issues. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the show is a failure. Polygon Pictures horribly executed an adaptation. It is ambitious to animate humans with CG and the studio is not technically adept enough to execute smooth motion with it. Polygon Pictures joins the ranks of the garbage studios. Studio Deen, Idea Factory, and even KOO-KI could make this show better than Polygon Pictures. It makes me sad that the promotional videos for the new \u201cBerserk\u201d anime will also look like an unfinished project. Guts, if he were real, would bitch slap all those animators in the face with \u201cDragonslayer\u201d for disgracing the well-deserved number 1 rated manga on this site. Real fans hold standards to their favorite series. If the anime does the manga justice, you should love and cherish it. When they fail at it, the fans should voice their disappointed opinions. Fans do not change their profile picture to a character from the show while rating and reviewing the show at a 10 when they have only seen 4 episodes of the series. \\n",

            "content": "\"Don't judge a book by its cover\": a phrase that I'm sure many of us are familiar with, being one that has long transcended both generational and ethnic background to be used across the globe. A phrase that has taken on several reiterations, but still maintains the same direct message. It's simple, to the point, and always relevant when entering the world of any storytelling medium. As much as many of us would like to think that we could quickly discern the contents of a show solely off of the art cover and synopsis, there are times when we are all proven wrong. \r\nTake theoutward appearances of Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica and Gakkougurashi! for example. Both titles display an outer shell that could be described as innocent or even a bit too cloying upon first encounter. Had any veteran anime viewer taken a glance at them with no prior knowledge, it could be easy to understand if they had fallen for the fa\u00e7ade. When any viewer becomes accustomed to familiarized signs in certain anime they've experienced before, it isn't out of character for complacency to kick in. \\n\r\nWhether we want to or not, past experiences tend to lead to some subconscious rewiring of expectations for individual content we perceive later on. It's how we refine our viewing habits and why we tend to avoid certain things that set off red flags in our heads due to unsavory experiences. It's a primal reaction our ancestors had to avoid danger and one we adopted for more trivial things, like avoiding shows that aren't in our favor. It's a habit with polarizing results, but still, an understandable one we all share in one way or another. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if one were to glance at the outward appearance of Ajin, I'm sure the prenotion to judge it would take hold quickly. With promotional art and a premise that seem to enforce the trappings of a typical bishounen action romp, it isn't hard to see why that knee-jerk reaction to label it would occur. But what we see on the outside, and what we actually get, is a whole other story. While Ajin may pattern itself to other shows of that caliber, it quickly deviates from the tropes associated with it to become something far more promising. This anime is a book that screams one thing while the pages on the inside reveal another. \\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in a fictional universe where humanity stumbled upon the discovery of a new sub-species of beings dubbed the Ajin. Having the appearance of regular humans, the Ajins are thought to be immortal, while also possessing several supernatural abilities. Due to their documented cases' being extremely rare, they quickly become subjects of superstition. But all that changes when a resurgence of the species occurs in modern day Japan, bringing with it a new public frenzy that leads us into the narrative that unfolds before us today.\\n\\n\r\nWhat we have here is a fundamental case of man vs. \"allegorical\" man, something many of us is familiar with, whether we're aware of it or not. Every time there's a story that pits opposing ideals of beings capable of human-level thought, (whether that be man or beast), it follows the man vs. man conflict. This isn't always limited to one conflict either, as multiple topics tend to branch out from its inception, as demonstrated with movies like Dances With Wolves, or Cameron's Avatar, for the modern viewing audience. It's the tale of societal discrimination and xenophobic rejection of anything that doesn't align with someone's own principals. These are the stories that advocate awareness by providing social commentary with the human condition being used as its platform. \\n\\n\r\nThese familiar tales are no stranger to the world of anime. You don't have to look far, with titles such as Parasyte and Shinsekai Yori adhering to this traditional narrative, both of which serve as ambassadors in anime's ability to craft this tale just as efficiently as anything found on the silver screen. But despite the commonality of these stories, it's still one that's easily botched when handled with little finesse, with titles such as Tokyo Ghoul and Terra Formars being testaments to that fact. Thankfully, Ajin isn't a case of the latter, although, I do hesitate to place it on the caliber of the prior entries mentioned that did this narrative right. If I had to give a comparative evaluation, I'd say it finds itself somewhere comfortably in the middle. \\n\\n\r\nWhile not as fleshed out as Shinsekai Yori or as multifaceted as Parasyte, Ajin still manages to hold its own. Instead of letting the subject matter marinate in the subconscious of the viewer, Ajin makes swift actions to drive home the messages quickly it wishes to convey. This gives room for a narrative that's always in motion, which is ideal for those seeking immediate results. And while this to-the-point approach may leave many of its concepts explored only on a surface level, it still allows for a more consumable binge-watching experience as a result. It prioritizes thrills over thematic pondering, which makes it more accessible to a broader market. This also makes Ajin an excellent gateway for those who want just to get their toes wet with heftier concepts, but aren't quite ready to dive in just yet. It sprinkles in commentary about our current populace's desensitized state, as well as touching upon ethical treatment taken by governing bodies. It does just enough to whet the appetite of the viewer and add flavor to its narrative. And for those who want just a little bit extra with their action, this might just be all that's needed. But despite that fact, there's still a barrier of entry for those willing to crack the spine of this anime, and that, of course, is the usage of 3DCG animation.\\n\\n\r\nDeciding to use 3DCG, similar to that of Knights of Sidonia, was probably the most significant deterrent for those who saw past the generic premise and appearance. And in all honesty, just hearing this news alone was perhaps the reason many overlooked this title altogether. Yes, the presentation can take some getting use to for viewers who don't find it aesthetically appealing, but for those not bothered by the occasional uncanny valley effect, the show remedied this problem better than most. Unlike Knights of Sidonia, the individual movements here show far more mobility. The soundtrack, composed of Gothic organs, booming Hans Zimmer-esque fog horn sections, heavy guitar riffs and more, also helped in compensating in places where the animation found itself lacking. It might not be by much for viewers who are bothered by even the thought of CGI, but it certainly made it a far more palatable experience for those that could see beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights that occurred throughout the series weren't reduced to two people smashing fists with no rational thought but are rather tactical bouts where Ajins and humans alike use their strengths and weaknesses against each other. Even with the apparent advantage given to the Ajins, the human opposition still found many clever ways of exploiting their powers by using it against them. This was also the case for when Ajins clashed among themselves. The show went into a decent amount of detail in explaining the body mechanics of the Ajins as well as the extent of their abilities. And the more an Ajin was aware of its strengths, the better it was at utilizing it in and outside the battlefield.\\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the clearest demonstration of the show's deviation from its inherent trappings can be found with the main characters themselves. In order to avoid turning this into a long-winded analysis, I'll go over only the two prominent figures highlighted throughout the show. They were far from being the most fully-realized characters of the 2016 Winter season (that honor resides with Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu); however, they were still far removed from the cookie-cutter lineup that would come standard-fare with these stories. And what they may have lacked in development, they more than made up for with their distinct personality traits and interactions. They're simple, but at the same time, subjects which would make for interesting, if only brief, character studies.\\n\\n\r\nTake, for example, our main character, Kei Nagai. The first defining trait he exhibits immediately separates him from the atypical wide-eyed idealist or the hot-blooded teen that come almost default with his role. Instead of a rehashed archetype with only a different coat of paint to define him, what we get is a selfish misanthrope who places his own self-preservation and needs above others. Whether he had to be deceptive or fake empathy to weasel his way out of trouble territory isn't of concern to him. There are no delusions of grandeur festering in his mind; he is very much aware of the extent of his capabilities, as well as his amoral standing with the world around him. And while not entirely being pegged as a nihilist, he doesn't place trust in anything that isn't an irrefutable truth. Kei Nagai is a teen whom we've either seen or were at one point in our lives, which makes him one of the most honest depictions of this age group in some time. Unless he's given a feasible or self-beneficial option to assist someone, he will not go out of his way to aid them if it means placing his own life in harm's way. Anything outside of that is merely done out of forced guilt or social obligation. This underrepresented type of character makes him far from your garden variety, and as a result, an intriguing one to follow.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as much as some of us would like to take the moral high road in response to other people's suffering, the truth is most of us don't acknowledge it with any substantial sympathy. And it's for this reason that our protagonist becomes not only well-depicted but also easily identifiable for our modern society. Now, this isn't to say some won't find his actions deplorable; there are certainly lots of people out there with a healthy moral fiber, but his personality and actions are properly documented for the audience to understand his psyche, regardless of one's own personal ethics. He isn't going to fulfill the role of any white-knight advocate anytime soon, but in the context of the story he's placed in, his personality is tailor-made for the current social climate.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while Kei Nagai retains the central character role, the true star of the series was none other than Satou. Satou, also nicknamed \"The Hat\" by officials, is quite the enigmatic figure. With a hospitable, soft-spoken demeanor upon initial contact, he brings with himself an aura of accumulated wisdom, but lurking just below the surface of his thinly veiled smile lies a man with a very twisted moral compass. Like the hybrid of a cunning old fox and someone akin to that of Magneto from the X-men franchise, there's nothing he won't do to reach his intended goal. While wanting for the betterment of his Ajin brethren, the path he takes to get there is paved with the blood of opposition and bystanders alike, all while sadistically reveling in the madness he brews up. He's a charismatic demon in sheep's clothing, a man who nonchalantly goes about his business with no sign of remorse, which is made all the more menacing given his weathered age. Any youth can demonstrate raw ferocity towards someone, but it's the carefully calculated approach of a much older man that strikes fear into the officials in this series. Satou, for all intents and purposes, is the show's undisputed badass, a title he more than lives up to. \\n\\n\r\nAnother character worth briefly addressing was Yuu Tosaki, an official who balances out the opposing ideals of Satou and Kei. He's your \"all business no pleasure\" kind of detective who is given the task to apprehend the Ajins by any means necessary. While he came across as one note, in the beginning, that is later alleviated with the reveal of his motivation. Outside of Yuu Tosaki, the rest of the secondary characters aren't fleshed out to any extent, but they are given distinct enough personality traits to make their inclusion warranted. All in all, the characters, whether essential or minor, helped in bringing the world and conflict to life. \\n\\n\r\nThis title proves that even action shows can have some level of thought and planning placed into them. It never tried to be something far more than what it was and performed well with the material it had to work with. For those thinking that this would be just another bishounen-cock-fight title, I implore you to discard that premature notion and give this show a try.\\n\\n\r\nThere was never a dull moment while watching this anime. With a plot that continued to push forward and main characters that always kept me on the edge of my seat, I found a great deal of enjoyment here. Satou's actions alone were more than enough for me to power through it. While the art was a bit off-putting at times, it never got in the way of me enjoying any part of the series. In terms of quality, it's somewhere between Tokyo Ghoul and Parasyte. If TG were McDonalds and Parasyte were a 5-star restaurant, then Ajin would be your local diner.\\n\\n\r\nAjin was a show that could have easily dissipated under the weight of its own premise but managed to hold up incredibly well. With narrative choices and thoughtful insight that demonstrated a level of competency lacking in similar titles, Ajin has proven to be a show worth the initial investment. And with everything being taken into consideration, Ajin has become one of the few documented cases of an \"edgy shounen\" being done right.",

            "content": "Ajin- What Tokyo Ghoul Wanted to Be... and failed miserably at!\r\nAjin- also the most unfairly ignored series of Winter 2016. There, it's been said. If you were one of the few people who can see past a childish, baseless, and unwarranted dislike of 3D CGI based anime on principle- good for you, because Ajin delivers a quality sci-fi/superpower tale, regardless of the form it's rendered in. \r\nBecause it's first on everyone's mind- the first thing to address here is the animation. Yes, 3D CGI can be scary. We've all seen monstrosities of bad animation like the ASS dragon from Fate Stay Night, the original Ghostin the Shell SAC, Absolute Duo, and many others. Yes, we're all fully aware of how ugly that plastic shader looks. To that end, Ajin can be ugly- and the worst part is the framerate, which is very sluggish at times and drags the visual experience down. However, for a show that was rendered entirely in 3D, this is not the end of the world. The majority of it is very easy to watch and flows well- and given the dark subject material, how it's cast in a washed out, at some points almost grayscale color scheme, but the few bright moments seem brighter by comparison in an otherwise pretty dreary show. \\n\\n\r\nThe next thing I feel led to discuss are the comparisons to Tokyo Ghoul that I alluded to in the title. The subject matter here is quite similar, only with Ajin taking a step toward realism and making good on its threats, minus the terrible teen angst and melodrama. See, the Ajin are a small group of humans who have the ability to regenerate their bodies upon dying. No matter how gruesome their injuries, they always come back to life in a few seconds- making them almost entirely invincible. Because they're also human, they have similar fallibility to crippling, choking, or otherwise being incapacitated. To further complicate matters, they're also able to summon an invisible, (to everyone who is not an Ajin) but humanoid black specter which can be used as a proxy and controlled remotely- to do combat, spy, whatever. The catch is that they can only use this once or twice per day, before needing to regenerate. \\n\\n\r\nThe Ajin are, because of the actions of one man named Satou, hunted by the government- resulting in a sort of class warfare, the nearly invincible Ajin VS the police and special agents whose job it is to control knowledge of and movements of the Ajin- all deemed a national threat from the terroristic operations of the murderous Satou- a broken psychopath with para-military training who exists for no purpose other than to incite fear and shock into the populace of Japan through killing- which he thoroughly enjoys. \\n\\n\r\nHowever much this story may be about Satou though, the main character he is not. \\n\r\nKei Nagai, a student who reminds me a lot of Light Yagami, albeit with a much more human mind and cold streak, is involved in a bus accident walking home from school. Smeared on the ground along with his life blood and organs, and dead- this black smoke appears from his body and a crackling sound is heard. Kei sits up, clothes torn from grinding along the road underneath the bus- very alive. Kei recognizes immediately that he's an Ajin, and that his life has just changed dramatically- most likely for the worst. His friends freak out, and then there's a knock at the door. Kei recognizes that it's time to go, and he, who just wants to live quietly and away from the Ajin madness, takes off on the run. Kei is, and shows that he's different from many superpower shonen main characters in that he's a very calculating, cold person. He's not afraid to use anyone or anything in his path if he sees it as a means to get ahead, and through this, he manages to slip under the radar, even if it costs him his friends and family, his force of will and intellect are what keep him alive after the government gets on his scent. \\n\\n\r\nSee, the world of Ajin is built up very well from the beginning, featuring students in school gossiping about this viral video, supposedly featuring an Ajin being murdered over and over by shady government officials. We later see news broadcasts with the names of suspected Ajin and recognize that there's a very large gap of information missing to the public about what they really are. This introduction (in a realistic way) of the public intrigue is very natural feeling, and sets the stage for a socio-political facet to the show later on, with government coverups and information war. \\n\\n\r\nOn this note, it should be noted that this show really pushed the envelop of gritty content, at least in recent memory, especially in how it presents some of the violent acts. It's never my place to spoil anything, but suffice to say that Satou takes some very drastic and destructive measures (all within the realm of reality, mind you) to make Japan very aware of his presence and the threat he poses as both an Ajin and terrorist. Likewise, the story does a great job of making everything very morally gray, with abuses of power by the government and shrewd manipulations by Satou to shift the public opinion of the ignorant masses towards the plight of the Ajin. \\n\\n\r\nAs a dark, engaging, and interesting shonen, Ajin is definitely one of the more memorable of the genre in recent memory. It took many of the themes that Tokyo Ghoul had breadth in, and then gave them depth. Where Tokyo Ghoul was afraid to take steps, or just completely missed steps, especially with its characters, we have much stronger motivation and reaction from the characters here. The plot advances in a way that can be followed, but not in the most predictable fashion, with a couple of genuinely shocking scenes to boot. Though this 13 episode series doesn't completely wrap up the story (that will be left to a sequel movie sometime later this year, a la Madoka Magica), it ends on a satisfying enough note that I wasn't perturbed by its somewhat abrupt ending. I'm willing to give this my stamp of approval, and even go so far as to say that it's the unsung anime of the season for staying true to what it began, not pulling any punches, and remaining consistently good throughout its run- something no other show from this past season can claim.",

            "content": "It\u2019s pretty much like a horror movie. Ajin uses a lot of ideas borrowed from horror lecture and fiction. These include ancient monsters (the Ajins), government hunting them down, and a dark story about how a young man\u2019s life changing forever after getting involved with them. Based on the manga of the same name, Ajin is more or less a thrilling story. \r\nTo clear things up straight, there\u2019s actually a film trilogy as well based on this series. The second and third film has yet to be released (at the time this review was written). The TV anime adaptation reflects on a deeper storytelling withsome additional aspects. Although based on the first film, the TV anime adaptation still remains largely unchanged. The story begins with a young man named Kei Nagai. He is living in a world where Ajin exist, demi-humans that have existed almost 17 years ago first found in Africa. They are considered a world wonder as many people fear them yet also consider them very special. This is where Kei\u2019s story comes in as he realizes that he is far from normal.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, the show was rather predictable at first. The first few episodes heavily hints that there\u2019s something wrong with Kei and that his connection with the Ajin runs deeper than he thinks. It turns into a cat-and-mouse game scenario where police, government, and other individuals are after him. Even his friends betray him so that they can reap the awards of capturing an Ajin. The only ally he has at first is Kaito, a delinquent friend that he\u2019s known from school. But truthfully, the reality is that the only person he can trust is himself. As the story progresses, we see the darker side of humanity and Kei himself even undergoes changes. It\u2019s not made specifically clear though if he was always cold or became more aware afterwards. Either way, the show explores his character in ways that drastically contrasts with his personality when first introduced. The interesting part about Kei also shows what it really means to survive. In their world, it\u2019s to kill or be killed because apparently, being captured by the government pretty much guarantees death. Don\u2019t believe me? Just ask science.\\n\\n\r\nAs a dark story, the characters in this series also explores the darker side of what humans are capable of. Scientists at facilities are tasked with discovering the secrets of Ajin and immorality so test subjects are usually tortured for information and data. Then, there are noticeable characters like Satou who strives to do anything to get what he wants including killing innocents with little value of human life. The question makes us wonder who the real monsters are: Ajin or humans like him. Even Kei\u2019s sister seems to have forsaken him as she thinks him as a monster. Satou\u2019s ambition to rule the country with his twisted goals also makes him a cruel sociopath with intelligence and resources. In ways, he is somewhat similar to Kei as both lacks empathy to kill and unafraid to die. Both are also quite reckless in their actions as well and often willing to take risks to get what they need. As the story progresses, other characters including those willing to participate in terrorism are introduced in the series to really show how twisted some humans can be.\\n\\n\r\nAs you may have guessed by now, the show isn\u2019t very much for the lighthearted. There\u2019s little to no room for comedy and the story itself is not afraid to kill of characters at the click of its fingers. There\u2019s hardly any humans that we can feel sympathy for throughout the show as well. Even Tosaki and his assistant Izumi can be hard to get attached to as they are active members to track down Ajins. So in essence, it should be recognizable that the show is hard to get people to like its characters. I think the only character that can be considered a valuable friend would be Kaito. He is selfless and often takes daring risks to help out others including putting his own life at stake to help out Kei. Unfortunately, he is perhaps just a very small part of kindness in their dark world. Meanwhile, the show pushes the idea of humans capable of being the real monsters. The downside is that it\u2019s what we see mostly on paper rather than a deeper insight on their characters. The manga does a better job at adapting characterization such as with characters like Satou.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I wasn\u2019t a fan of the CGI artwork of the show at first. Polygon Pictures helms the show with their production and it\u2019s evident that they utilizes what they are capable of. However, I think the CGI works quite well in the end. Action remains fluid and more detailed with Ajins\u2019 fighting capabilities. It also gives them a more terrifying appearance with added aesthetics such as special effect particles. The character designs seems more or less average though. But if you\u2019re looking for violence, Ajin excels exactly at doing what it is and that\u2019s showing delivering bloodshed. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is effective and as the show progresses, it gets more noticeable especially during more tense moments. For most of the story, we have to remember that Kei is running away from society as people seek to capture him. The OST and music works effectively to showcase the story of this cat-and-mouse game scenario. Adding to the eerie music, we also get good voice acting like with Satou\u2019s sadistic and sarcastic personality. Kei\u2019s change also becomes noticeable as his voice mannerism becomes more cold and lack of empathy. The show also does a neat job with both the OP and ED theme too with stellar choreography.\\n\\n\r\nWhat to expect from Ajin in the end? A more compressed story that exploits the darker side of humanity. It\u2019s a series that isn\u2019t exactly fun to watch if you\u2019re not a fan of cruel experimentation, government conspiracies, and betrayals. However, the show does a fairly good job at telling its story. Despite some lack of characterization, Ajin handles its themes well and keeps the viewers at their seats to anticipate what\u2019s to come next. Every episode expands more on the story while focusing on the most important elements. For anyone who is interested in some supernatural horror fiction, this is definitely something to look out for. And to be honest, it\u2019s quite a thrill.",

            "content": "Ajin is a more violent X-Men but it's nitty gritty without displaying the brutality and crossing the line toward torture porn (if you don't count the X-Men graphic novels). The protagonist, Kei Nagai, is a pacifist yet he's deeply flawed. He calculates every move he makes and, if something doesn't directly effect him, he doesn't care enough to take action. Whether or not the world is in turmoil, Kei just wants to live in peace. As the roster of characters grow, the story develops into a question of whether or not the many is worth protecting\u2014even if it means the same (if not, more) sufferingfor those who are oppressed.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is superb at confronting real world problems such as bigotry, capitalism, and other politics. I love that a lot of the violent sequences is implied instead of illustrating it entirely for shock value. Antagonists come with all kinds of motives and every one of them makes the audience think, \"Their actions are more understandable now.\" Not morally right, but understandable given their circumstances. There are basically no plot holes worth mentioning. Every character has a reason for their actions.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire production was masterfully thought out\u2014from the writing, to the animation. I have to give major kudos to the animation team because the art direction is beautiful and seamless. The way Polygon Pictures utilized 3D animation to give their world and characters more life is incredible. Their style makes every movement more realistic and incredibly fluid. This coupled with the sound and music production makes this one of the most cohesive anime out there. Ajin is well paced while keeping up with the high tension. Polygon took tons of risks with plenty of rewarding payback. Strongly recommended!",

            "content": "Ohh Ajin, hahaha... where do I start this great anime.\r\nWell, let's just start, with, Yeah, the CGI is cringy to watch as f*** according to those watchers who've seen Ajin. But, boy oh boy, the story is a Roller Coaster ride filled with twists who is the real villain at the first half of this anime, to the another twists if the protagonist is a hero or an anti-hero.\r\nI can't help myself on how this anime reminds me of \"Tokyo Ghoul\", both have to face their fate on how they die and how they survive in the process, how they learn that they have powersto revive themselves, and how they we're tortured. However, comparing to TG's Kaneki Ken and Ajin's Nagai Kei, Kei's character here is somewhat dreadful and reveals that he's the worst guy as the protagonist of this story. According to the characters that are affiliated with Kei, he's a trash and he doesn't care anyone for himself. That's why in this anime, Kei is cold-blooded and doesn't care anything and anyone surrounds him. But that everything changes when he left home after learning he's an Ajin, saving the ones who tortured him and bumping to an old lady. But still keeping his rotten personality until a little development change within him over the next half of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot here is kinda messy, at first I was like, \"Who's the REAL bad guys here? Is it the government or the rebels?\" and the second one was like \"Is Kei a Bad guy or a good guy?\" A lot of questions are circulating here in this anime, which is why I felt curious until I find the answers there few episodes later. As a matter of fact, I kinda like how the story goes, including how messy it is and then put it one by one like a jigsaw puzzle until it completely clears the picture why and how they do it. It's a mystery anime, and this is what I was looking for all this time! I really do like this kind of stuff, and this one is, without a doubt, a GOOD STUFF! Also, the action, BY GAWD the action is pretty intense too! Especially how the man with the hat named Satou delivers a good blow against the Police during the terror attacks. \\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, Ajin is a pretty piece of action anime that you surely need to watch out for. The action is pretty great and the plot was fantastic! It might be sound biased, but you should try it out and see it for yourself. Especially if you're a fan of action and mystery anime. Nevermind the CGI arts or whatnot. The plot here is pretty interesting to say the least. So go get it NOW!",

            "content": "Judging from its current popularity, and how it is ranked, I'd say it is severely underrated at this current time. \r\nI'll first address what most people take fault with in this anime. The art.\r\nAdmittedly, when I first started watching, I was put off by the CG animation, as it is not something I am used to. That however is not saying that I didn't quickly warm up to it. The style of animation allows for character movements to be incredibly realistic.  I am however willing to admit that the backgrounds could do with some touching up. \r\nThe story is engaging, and easy to follow,but most of all, it is suspenseful. I can't really delve further into that without giving away any spoilers, so I'll just leave it at that.\\n\r\nThe sound is excellent. The music in particular really suits the sense of desperation that haunts the main character every step of the way.\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, they are incredibly interesting and/or likable. The main antagonist, Satou isn't just an average villain, doing things for the sake of being evil. He does things for very understandable reasons. Even Tosaki isn't the average, \"big bad government agent.\" He makes mistakes, and takes things into his own hands to get results, which makes him, like Satou, unique and identifiable.  The main character Kei Nagai is also pretty interesting. He isn't your typical generic kind but angsty teen hero. Kei is actually kind of a cold asshole, something that isn't common among anime mains, which is something I found quite refreshing. (Although I know a few people who kind of hate Kei as a result.)\\n\r\nAjin season 1 kept me on the edge of my seat, and always wanting to know what happens next. I am very glad I watched this, and it is a shame to see that it has slipped under a lot of peoples' radar. It definitely deserves more recognition and I am looking forward to the next season.",

            "content": "Let me start by apologising, somehow I got the mistaken impression that 91 Days was a horror anime, which it isn't. I'ts a historical thriller. For those of you who were looking forward to my reviewing that, I'll review it in November, but for the moment, let's talk about an actual horror anime. To  be specific, let's talk about Ajin. A supernatural horror mystery from Polygon Pictures. Based off of the manga from Sakurai Gamon. I have no idea what to expect from it. I haven't heard anything about it. Let's delve into it. \r\nStory:\r\nThe titular Ajin look human, act human and think ofthemselves as human. The key differences are that Ajin can't die. Every time they take mortal damage, a black mass swirls around them and they resurrect. Ajin can also summon black humanoid shapes that are invisible to human eyes. There are rumours about the Ajin. Some say that the government offers a reward of a hundred million yen to anyone who helps capture one. Some say they're subjected to cruel and inhumane experiments once they're captured.  Nagai Kei is a quiet, studious lad who doesn't much care for people. After an accident, he learns that he is, in fact, an Ajin. Now, the government is after him and he's on the run, convinced that there's some truth to the rumours. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw with this series is that it doesn't really develop its ideas that well. It'll spend a little time with something and then move on to the next thing without ever returning to flesh out the previous thing. The consequence is that there are a lot of plot points that are allowed to drop and others that could have been considerably more interesting, but aren't given time to build up because they really wanted to get to the next big moment. Not like the big moment they were on mattered that much. It's also worth noting that the \u201chorror\u201d of this series is largely just that it has supernatural creatures. There's all of one moment in the entire thirteen episodes that actually kind of works as horror. \\n\\n\r\nIn spite of that, I do like the idea of the series. I like that it has moral ambiguity with neither side of the conflict being moral. And neither one is morally questionable in some over the top or cartoonish way. They have motivations that legitimately work, given the scenario. The narrative does also do a good job of keeping you interested in what's coming next. In spite of its tendency to rush things. Its very good at ending its episodes at just the right moment to get the audience interested in what's coming next. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis series is somewhat reminiscent of Phantom: Requiem in that it doesn't have any morally good characters, mostly. It has a couple side characters who seem genuinely like good, supportive people. Its major characters, in contrast, are very much a self-centred group. Each of whom is willing to do terrible things if it serves them or helps  them towards their goal. That being said, it is interesting to watch how they respond when their interests clash and they do, largely, come across as actual people, at least in terms of personality. It's also kind of interesting that so many of them act out of desperation at various points in the narrative.  That being said, the dynamics don't always work. A big example is Kei and Kaito. We  basically see flashbacks of how they used to be friends a long time ago and, somehow, it  left such an impact that Kaito is willing to risk himself for Kei. Even though Kei's literally spent years ignoring him. If their relationship troubles had been a recent development, it might be believable, but with that much time it comes across as really contrived. They really  needed to show us more of their relationship and why it means so much to Kaito even after all this time, which does tie into the series' general problem of rushing ahead without developing things properly. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this isn't very good. Its not that it uses obvious CG, it's that it uses obvious CG that looks to be at about the level of a Playstation 2 game, and not one like Final Fantasy XII that looked really nice. No, it looks like an early PS2 game when developers weren't even close to pushing the system's limits. It's more than a little distracting to see those visuals when they're trying to have a serious moment. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe vocal cast in this is pretty good. Miyano Mamoru, Ootsuka Houchuu, Hosoya Yoshimasu, Komatsu Mikako & Sakurai Takahiro are all good in this. Kanno Yugo did the  music for  the series and it's decent enough. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't any. Nor is there romance in the series in general, save for one character's motivation. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Ajin is okay. It has some good ideas and it is interesting, but rushing from one major plot point to the next hurts it. As does the generally weak artwork.  If the series had had twenty episodes and spent more time on its important plot points, it could have been really good. Unfortunately, it doesn't have that time. So, it's rushed, but still decent enough. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. If the premise sounds interesting and you can forgive the artwork, you might get into it. Next week I'll end this year's horror month with Danganronpa 3: Zetsubou-hen. In the meantime, keep your fabulosity gauge filled.",

Oy vey, just kill me now for thisone.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Nagai Kei is a boy who lives in a world with beings known as 'Ajin'.  Ajin are rare being with the unexplainable powers to regenerate their entire bodies and can essentially cheat death as they can revive indefinitely.  No one really knows why the Ajin are around, except the fact that these beings are considered a threat to humanity, so on and so forth.  After being run over by a truck (Oh Truck-san), he and the rest of his town find out that Kei is an Ajin, and as such, sends this child into a whole new world where he is now hunted down for being a threat to humanity, despite really not doing anything. \\n\\n\r\nThe Ajin anime is more or less supposed to be a prologue to the Ajin movies that're supposed to be made later on this year.  True to its role, this anime plays out as a series that gives you information, but at the same time, withholds a lot of the story in order to keep viewer interest.  Now this here creates the biggest problem of this anime, information.  Ajin suffers a severe lack of information to the point that the series creates plot holes rather than mysteries.  A lot of the series revolves around the three players in this game of government and Ajin chess that has a lot missing pieces by the end of the series.  They hint a lot as to why each side does what they do, and their respective opinions on Ajin and what role Ajin should play in the world, but never give us concrete reasons as to why they choose the side that they do.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the events of the story are just really boring and confusing.  The first four episodes follow a chase scene.  Literally, it's just a chase scene.  That is not exciting.  Plus, the show switches to the three sides back and forth all the time, giving bits and pieces of the events of each respective side, and it's hard to keep track with what each side is really doing, especially since most of the the series is just discussion on the 'next plan' with only a couple scenes max of actual plan execution.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Ajin is just a prologue that doesn't give us enough information to create interest for the series.  There aren't many reasons to explain why the characters have the opinions they do, there isn't well enough pacing to fully explain or understand why such an event happens sometimes, and the series ends with a 'read the manga/watch the movies' ending, which is understandable for this series in particular since it IS a prologue, but after seeing the anime, I have NO interest to see any more of this trainwreck.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Terrible Pacing\\n\r\n-  Lack of character motivation\\n\r\n-  Choppy transitions from character perspective\\n\r\n-  Stories intentionally left incomplete to the point of plot holes\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As mentioned before, Ajin has three separate factions that each have their own 'leader' and set of underlings.  Just to get it out of the way, the 'underlings' as I will dub them are really plot-related and hold little to no worth in the series.  Sure, some of them do, but they're quickly forgotten, and are more or less forgettable since either our 'leader' characters just dispose of them, or they're just mindless tools at their disposal.  \\n\\n\r\nUp first is our newest member of the Ajin, Nagai Kei.  Kei is a very conflicting character from beginning to end.  He is explained to be a very emotionless and uncaring chaotic neutral sociopath who only sees opportunities to use people for his own benefit than give two shits about them.  Now as a concept, this is interesting, as he's not your typical 'positive' protagonist who wants to 'save everyone' with his powers but instead only wants to use his newfound abilities to his own benefit and existence.  Now this comes with a duo of conflicting aspects.  The first of which is the fact that he exhibits human emotions.  At times, Kei has bouts of actually giving a shit about people, and while that does instill some character growth, it comes off as some unexplained motives that as expected, don't do anything towards his character as a whole.  He goes right back to his sociopathic mood and the series more or less pretends that what he has done is unimportant.  In addition, Kei himself doesn't really have a motive.  The series doesn't explain what his plan is or what he does, and writes him in to more or less sit on the sidelines and wait for something to happen from the other two factions before springing into action.  He doesn't feel like he has any worth in this series, and for your supposed main character, this is a deadly mistake.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Tosaki, the sort of 'lawful good' character that the series has as the one in charge for 'killing' or 'taking care' of Ajin.  His whole character is wrapped around his sheer hatred for the Ajin, and his motivation for as to WHY he hates Ajin is very incomplete.  We get one scene to hint as to why he hates Ajin, but it's a very generic hint that doesn't give any specifics.  Sure, you can speculate, but at the same time, it's really lazy writing because even with that piece of information in mind, he just goes \"Kill Ajin, Kill Ajin, Kill Ajin\", so on and so forth.  He's one-dimensional and bland.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then finally, Satou, the experienced Ajin who plays the Chaotic Evil side to this equation.  Satou is insane, very, very, very insane.  He is insane to the point that there is no reason to explain as to why he is insane or how he became so messed up, and there's nothing beyond that.  His motives, like the other two, are missing as well.  Why does he want to commit genocide?  For fun?  Why does he say he wants to rule the country at the end?  What's his reason?  There're a lot of holes to Satou's character that don't add up.  The show makes it seem like there's more reason to him doing that than just wanting to cause mayhem, but they don't tell you or even allude to it.  He's just \"Rah! I'm an Ajin!  I'mma make ya'll dead!\" before laughing manically as he stands atop a falling building cause he can't die.  Crazy characters like this are cool and nice, but without any rhyme or reason as to why they are crazy, there's no point in giving a crap about them.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, characters are...incomplete.  Their sheer lack of any kind of motive makes it so that there is no one to root for.  There is honestly no reason to care about anyone since you don't know or understand the reasons for their actions.  Personally, I think the characters are more or less the biggest problem of this series more so than the story, and I could not care any less about them since as a viewer, I don't know WHO THEY ARE.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Horrendously lacking in character and motivation\\n\r\n-  Side cast are plot-related and largely unimportant\\n\\n\r\nArt: Polygon Pictures and their CGI came into the picture when animating Ajin, and personally, I'll put my own two cents out there, I despise this animation wholeheartedly.  I don't like complete CGI anime.  (Keep in mind, this part is a personal opinion, not me seriously critiquing the animation.)  \\n\\n\r\nLike Knights of Sidonia, Polygon Pictures comes to Ajin with their signature style of CGI animation with CGI rendered characters in a more or less hand-drawn setting.  The issue that comes with this style of animation comes with complications within the final product.  My problem with this comes more or less in the final few episodes of Ajin.  The rendering of the characters started to look choppy and the movement wasn't as fluid as it was previously.  In addition, there're some mouth movements and specifically facial expressions that looked nightmarish and just sort of awkward to look at.  Definitely not Polygon Picture's best work.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Polygon Pictures (This is depending on your take of the CGI artstyle.)\\n\r\n-     Lower quality towards the end of the series\\n\\n\r\nSound: In terms of music, the OP of Ajin is...actually one of, if not the one thing about this series that I genuinely liked.  The OP is this dark and foreboding action rock song that's at least to me, really nice to listen to.  It's not all that special in terms of memorabilia so it's more or less an acquired taste the way I see it.  The ED is a skippable track that really holds no worth.  I wouldn't care to listen to it again, since it just doesn't come off as an enjoyable song.  Nice visuals though.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Ah, Ajin.  When I first heard about you, I admit that I had a relatively decent amount of intrigue.  But after hearing how your entire animation was CGI, ooo, that was a kicker.  And yet, I persevered.  As the episodes kept rolling by, I'll be honest with you, I wanted to kill myself while watching this series, only to revive again when another episode came by, before killing myself all over again!  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?  \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I hated it.  I had no clue, ZERO CLUE, as to what precisely was going on.  Sure, there was the general plotline, but there were so many underlying things happening in the works that I did not care for this series.  There are actually a total of 4-5 factions rather than 3 in this series, and they're just barely hinted at to the point I wondered why they even bothered with it in the first place.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nKei, the story, Satou, the animation, Tosaki, the lack of character motivation, basically everything this show had to offer just made me want to claw out my eyes.  It was horrendously boring to sit through the characters' discussions and plan their next stage of attack.  It was like Death Note, but without actually cool characters, a good story, or intricate plans that made each opposing side want to best each other in a game of mind chess.  Rather it was a complete mess that expected people to care about the latter movies that would come out 'explaining' what the series was going to be about which, I'm gonna make a prediction, won't do shit.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nNo.  No.  Don't do it.  This anime is terrible in its execution and only creates confusion in place of actual intrigue.  The lack of explanation creates so many plot holes that it becomes infuriating to watch rather than really gripping.  I would've liked to enjoy this despite my absolute loathing for complete CGI animation, but this series just gave me no reason to give a damn.  My opinion?  Skip it.",

I can easily recommend this series. \r\nThe characters are complex enough to keep them interesting, especially the antagonist. I can say i favor him more than the main character.

There are plenty of characters introduced throughout the episodes being both good, and evil. The artwork is amazing, having deep and inky colors, awesome dynamic lighting, necessary motion blurring, absolutely no art mistakes to be seen, and is just loads of fun to watch. Audio is as good, being rich and deep, the audio quality and sound effects are quite unlike anything else in the anime\u2019s category and have a cinema-like feel. The intro and outro songs are both amazing, with theintro song being slightly fast-paced and outgoing, and the outro song being slower with a much softer tone. (P.S: The outro song is sung by the voice actor of Kei!).\\n\r\nThis anime is built up from a highly praised manga, and is flawless. Perfect art, perfect audio, perfect.. Everything. This anime has great potential to continue growing and is truly worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is recommended for people who like mixed action anime with mystery, horror, and more.",

            "content": "Ajin was one of those anime that received polarized views even before it started airing. Some were interested with the thrills is could give, while others were turned off by the use of CGI and the use of a familiar premise. However, if one could ignore or adjust to the CGI present in this series, they would be able to experience something much greater. Ajin is one of the best thriller anime to come out in recent time, and is easily of of the best of the winter season this year. It\u2019s cinematic presentation with a heavy amount of thrills is a fantastic experience nodoubt. And those who are fans of this genre couldn\u2019t be more pleased with Ajin\u2019s final results. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nAjin takes place in a setting where immortal human beings with supernatural abilities, known as Ajin, were discovered and society decided to eliminate them as they are a potential threat to humanity. Our protagonist, Kei, was a victim to a truck accident, which caused him to reveal his supernatural powers, revealing that he\u2019s an Ajin. The series focuses on Kei\u2019s story of being on the run, and the political and social views on Ajin. The premise is quite similar to some other anime of the same series, such as Tokyo Ghoul and Kiseijuu. However, Ajin manages to find its own name in this somewhat overused premise. The story managed to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout the series. It doesn\u2019t start to pick up until the third or fourth episode, but when it does pick up, it\u2019s insanely fun. The situations give to the characters of this series is very enjoyable and very intense. And the series also focuses on the political views of the situations and it\u2019s nice to see some focus on that. The series later felt like a battle between the government and the Ajin and how they can get as much people on their side. This take was definitely in interesting one, and they manage to create tension with this aspect of the story too. \\n\r\nStory: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nOne of the best things about Ajin is its presentation. With its writing, Ajin manages to create a more cinematic feel to it. It\u2019s perfect blend of music, cinematography, thrills and cliffhangers make this one hell of a ride. The pacing is also pretty good in the series. There is sufficient buildup given to the more thriller moments and during the action scenes, the pacing picks up rapidly. However, the third quarter of this series felt somewhat slow, especially after all those events that happened just episodes before. However, they do work well as buildup episodes for its final episodes. The focus of the series is also unique. Not only dies it focus on Kei\u2019s fugitive storyline, but also Satou\u2019s attempts of shaking society and making room for the Ajin species. Another really good this about Ajin is its consistent tone. For the entire series, Ajin manages to keep its thrills and dark presentation stable. The story does go into deeper matter such as politics and torture and the series manages to handle these well. And the present dark humor is also a delight. From Satou\u2019s remarks to Kei\u2019s \u201cIDGAF\u201d faces, the series manages to keep a slight humorous feel that relaxes the tension. \\n\r\nPresentation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nAjin features a great cast of characters that all stand out in their own way. The protagonist, Kei, is a really hard character to study. What first seemed like a typical helpless character, turned out to be a heartless and selfish character instead. The viewers go from sympathizing with him, to looking at him in disgust at times. The way the series foreshadows Kei\u2019s real characteristics was smartly done. Kei is the type of person who does good deeds not because its good, but because its right. Next we have Kei\u2019s best friend, Kaito, and he\u2019s also a pretty good character. Not much development is given to him, mainly because he doesn\u2019t play too big of a role in the overall story. Satou is easily one of the best things about this series. He\u2019s badass, he\u2019s brutal, he\u2019s ruthless, and he\u2019s so much fun. His ideologies are interesting and the actions he takes in order for Ajin to receive recognition is fun to watch. Then you have those governmental characters that are after these Ajin, such as Tosaki and Shimomura, and they succeed to be good supporting characters, even with their minimal role. \\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe art design is pretty good in Ajin. The atmosphere in the series was made to be very dark and gritty and it matches the content. The use of darker and bleached out colors, with its limited color palette. Was a really smart choice. The character designs are also fairly good. Kei\u2019s look matches both his helpless and ignorant sides. And Satoru\u2019s look can make him look both the gentleman and the *ssh*le. My major gripe with the art is the lack of details given to anything in the series, mainly due to its CGI. Architectures feel bland and lack detailing. Some surfaces, especially the grounds, feel very blurry. And at times, the CGI prevents the facial expressions to be clear or proper. \\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice about Ajin\u2019s animations is that it\u2019s CGI\u2026 completely. Some people do give it slack for being completely CGI, but personally, I think the CGI suited Ajin. The IBMs depicted in the series look super fluid and really makes the scene feel better. Even things like vehicle movements feel a lot better in its CGI format. That doesn\u2019t cover up the fact that the main use of CGI is to save time, effort and money. However, there are moments where the CGI doesn\u2019t look too good, such as character movements. Polygon Pictures isn\u2019t new to CGI. As a matter of a fact, the only work they have done are all in CGI. However, compared to most CGI products in anime, Ajin\u2019s one of the more polished ones. \\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Ajin is really good, which wasn\u2019t surprising considering the fact that this series has a good cast. You have Miyano Mamoru voice acting Kei, so it would be a joke saying that he didn\u2019t do a good job with Kei. Miyano does a fantastic job (of course) as he manages to make Kei look both helpless and arrogant. His \u201cIDGAF\u201d scenes were really well done. There\u2019s a torture scene involving Kei in this series and Miyano\u2019s voice acing skills really shine there. With his talent, he\u2019s able to make the viewers understand the pain the character is feeling. Fukuyama Jun, another extremely talented seiyuu, does Kou fantastically too. His character doesn\u2019t play too big of a role in this series, but with his limited role, he does really good. He\u2019s able to make the character feel humorous or serious whenever needed. Hosoya, Yoshimasa does a pretty good job as Kaito, even with his limited role. He does the best friend role pretty well. Ootsuka Houchuu does an excellent job as Satou, he can make his character looks wise and good or sadistic and evil when necessary. Sakurai Takahiro, who is another well-known seiyuu, does Tosaki really well. Other seiyuu such as Komatsu Mikako, Osaka Ryota and Suzaki Aya, all do a very well job too. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nWhere do I start with the music part of Ajin? The OP, \u201cYoru wa Nemureru kai?\u201d, is really catchy, upbeat, and it matches the series. It really sets the mood up for the series. The ED, \u201cHOW CLOSE YOU ARE\u201d is also very good. Unlike its more upbeat OP, the ED is more slower and its more relaxed (even if the visuals of the ED are rather the opposite). Ajin has some of the best background music you\u2019ll even hear. By the time I finished watching the third episode, I was begging to get hold of the soundtrack. The music really boosts up the thrills of the series. The beats are killer, especially when something really intense is happening in the series. The main theme of Ajin is absolutely fantastic as its upbeat, thrilling and nerve-wracking. Other tracks such as \u201cCrisis\u201d, \u201cGame\u201d, \u201cAgitation\u201d, and \u201cExecute\u201d are what makes this anime feel so much better. \\n\r\nMusic: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nAjin was one of the most enjoyable things to come from the winter season. It\u2019s thrilling and suspenseful. Its focus on not only Kei\u2019s fugitive life, but also the political situation of Japan after these incidents, makes the story even better. Its uniquely written protagonist and likeably written antagonist makes this series a lot better. The CGI at times did halt my experience with the series, but it\u2019s nothing too bad. The music in the series is one of the best I\u2019ve heard, and even if Ajin delivered nothing at all, at least I got myself a killer soundtrack. Plus, the series\u2019 cinematography and editing gives it a more cinematic experience, which increases the enjoyment of the series. And with the send of this series, I\u2019m dying for a second season already. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Ajin is one of those series that is worth checking out, especially those who are fans of the genre. Many people have skipped over this series because of the CGI or the lack of a proper release outside of Japan. But its thrilling storytelling with its cinematic feel makes a great experience. Plus, the use of music in the series is absolutely fantastic. The characters in the series is really good, particularly the main protagonist and antagonist. Its use of CGI is somewhat disappointing, especially during the more unpolished scenes. But it\u2019s content makes up for that easily. Overall, Ajin is something that shouldn\u2019t be judged just by key visuals and PVs, but rather with its great content. \\n\\n\r\n+ Very stylish as it has a cinematic vibe to it, with proper pacing and buildup \\n\r\n+ The main protagonist and antagonist are complexly made and enjoyable. \\n\r\n+ Plot focuses not only on Kei on the run, but Satou\u2019s attempts to shake society\\n\r\n+ Outstanding background music, and with its proper placement, the thrills increase. \\n\r\n- Takes a couple of episodes for it to get really interesting and break away from its somewhat overused premise\\n\r\n- Some of the CGI feels unpolished and makes the art lack details\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4/10",

            "content": "Okey, so this is my first written review. Ever.\r\nThe reason I chose to write this is because I've seen a lot of negative reviews about this anime.\r\nFirst of, I started watching this without being biased one way or another.\r\nIn other words, I had never heard of this anime or read anything about it, nor the manga.\r\nI was just happily scrolling my netflix one thursday night and Ajin came up.\r\nThe story sounded great so without looking it up or reading anymore than what was on the recap on netflix, I pressed play.\r\nThe plot, EXACLTY as great as I thought it would be. I love it, justright up my alley. I love the main character even though after 13 ep you still don't even begin do scratch the surface of Kei's depts and who he is or what he might become, which shows the potential this anime has! And yes, there is character development! Kei is a character you might not like in the first ep or even the third because there is so much happening that to understad and get to know Kei takes time, and it really keeps you hungering for the next episode!\\n\r\nKei is actully smart, which make you (well, me) like him A LOT. Its not one of those characters thats your typical two-dimensonal hero who just \"have to save everyone!\" who runs in, messes up, cries, gets some mystery power and saves the day because he got lucky- or gets saved by someone else and hopes that his power will come when his girlfriend is in trouble-type of guy. No, Kei is extremely smart, efficent but also kind and hounorble. In other words, he's a realistic type of guy and never makes you scream at your screen \"RUN ALREADY YOU STUPID HALFWIT!!!\". \\n\\n\r\nThe only negative thing (except it being just 13 ep!?!?!?!?) is, as you might have guessed, the art.\\n\r\nOr (I'm new to anime so forgive me), to me its not the ART itself. Because if you freeze the anime or look at it from at freezeframe point of view, I think the art is quite beautiful. Special, yes. But beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes it \"bad\" is, (again, new at this) the animation in itself?\\n\r\nIts like the characters and the flow and movement of all objects, charaters in particular, is just so... Awkward. Everytime I see the bodylanguage I think of those bobbled headed dogs, you know, the dolls you put on your office desk or something and the head bobs up and down?\\n\r\nOr it feels like watching a trailer of the sims 2.\\n\r\nThats how they move in the anime, and not just the characters.\\n\r\nSo yes, that ruined it a bit but after a few episoded I got (sort of) used to it.\\n\r\nNo, wait. Let me put it like this.\\n\r\nThe plot and characters were just too good to drop it or make me wanna stop just because the art was a bit \"bad\".\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, this is definately a new favourite! I REALLLYYYYYYY loved the plot and characters and I can't wait for a second season!!! \\n",

I'm not realy a fan of the art, but thats just my opinion, the characters are a bit forgetable, but not the worst. I definetly recommend this anime to those who like action and mystery, aswell as a hint of psycological thinking. The music is also quite nice, as I love the opening and ending.\r\nSynopsis:\r\nThis story begins with beings called Ajin, they are eternal beings that simply revive after they die. Our protagonist, Kai Nagai, wants to become a doctor and help other people. This all goes wrong when herealises that he is actualy one of these Ajin. He runs from home, as there is a reward for capturing an Ajin, and he feared that people would turn him in. Along with his friend Kaito, they escape from town.\\n\r\nThe story only gets more complicated from then on, so If you're thinking about watching it, I say: \"Give it a shot\"... its a great anime, that definetly diserves a watch.",

            "content": "The first thing that you will notice about Ajin is that it\u2019s not aesthetically pleasing. It uses choppy 3DCGI similar to that of Knights of Sidonia albeit the latter meshed better with its cold futuristic alien-like setting. While here it blemishes the what could have been eerie atmosphere. Fortunately it wasn't enough to detract any meaningful enjoyment from this thrilling, monster-horror war, laminated with a logical cast of characters with easy to grasp motivations.\r\nWhile I say the art is bad, it's mostly just the awkward character designs and the janky animation. The direction is good but there is never a moment that leaves you feelingthat what you just watched was awesome. Which is sad because there are plenty of bad ass moments intermingled with gut churning creativity. The Ajin fights between one an other only remained interesting because it led into more insight about them, the fights themselves were about as entertaining as watching an infant mashing two plastic darkly clad figures together until one is randomly declared as the victor. This sentiment holds true to an extent with all of the fights. When a character died the impact of that death was diluted and it almost rendered a comical feeling. \\n\\n\r\nDeath is abundant and characters utilizing tactics based on immortality is rife and occasionally clever. You see characters killing themselves to escape, to keep awake and to kill others. I was surprised to see a Hannibal reference made by the antagonist but at the same time it was clever contextually as you didn't have to have read Red Dragon to understand that the antagonist was about to play a trick through the media to attract the attention of the otherwise unidentifiable Ajins.  \\n\\n\r\nThe focus follows a few different characters from three groups; the government/pharmaceutical company and the Ajins seeking domination and the outsiders. There is little nuance between the main characters except a shared trait of logic and reasoning. Each has differing motivations and when these motivations collide, the conflict between them sparks up in believable and intriguing ways. This is largely thanks to the protagonist who to simply put and as other characters describe him as, a jerk.\\n\\n\r\nTo go a bit deeper, he is the kind of person who is coldly logical, narcissistic and has questionable morals. All he wants to do is live a simple, comfortable life. When you pit him against the empathetic hero who wants to save lives at the risk of his own, or the mastermind leader who seeks revenge, or even just his childhood friend who wants to help him, it calls for interesting scenarios and all of which have engaging resolutions. \\n\\n\r\nThe mystery about what the Ajins are and what they mean is interesting enough, at least for you to what to know more but it's really what the characters do with that knowledge which differentiates itself from shows with a similar \"Oh no, I'm a monster!?\" premise like Tokyo Ghoul and Parasyte.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that I watched the English DUB of this and it wasn't terrible. OST is decent although I literally can't remember what it was like and I watched this yesterday so take that as you will. \\n\\n\r\nAjin is at it's best when ideals clash, supernatural powers are manipulated and character insights are revealed. While it fails from delivering any spooky chills, it achieves on taking you on a thrilling adventure through a field of death, deceit and disestablishment.    \\n",

            "content": "\"Humane? Ajin aren't humans so the word humane doesn't apply to them.\"\r\nThe theme of humanity is a recurring one in this anime, consequently bringing me back to my highschool English days as I watched movies like Blade Runner and Frankenstein. The show does an amazing job showing the monsters and humans in both human and Ajin parties - and the word \"monster\" is not as clear cut as once thought out to be. \r\nStory - 8\r\nDon't be fooled by the comparatively low score for the story - it is great, it's just that I haven't read the manga yet, and the second season is justaround the corner. This is a preliminary score - which although may not be fair as the whole story has yet to be told, I think is justified. Without giving too much details on the main plot, the story revolves around a bunch of characters, the Ajin (both good and bad) - mysterious beings who have been granted immortality, the ones who are trying to capture the Ajin (although their motives may be unclear) and although there is a supposed main character - he doesn't do all that much in this season. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nA lot of people are put off by the CGI, but in all honesty, it does not take away from the experience. In fact, if anything, it makes the monsters seem even more creepy with their unnatural, robot like movements. In terms of the actual art itself, it is amazing. DON'T let the art put you off watching this anime - unless you really can't stand it, it is up to personal preference after all.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThe sound is spectacular. It meshes with the art style/CG perfectly, giving off eerie vibes at times, with intense suspenseful music to back it up. The opening song while not particularly memorable, fits well with the overall mood of the show. I've only watched/listened to the closing song once, because I'm too excited to watch the next episode for the next part of the story - and that's a good thing (although the closing song isn't very memorable either)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nThis is where this anime really shines. Characters are fleshed out in a subtle way - while ALL the characters still have many secrets to them, they tease and insinuate various reasons as to why a character behaves a certain way. The most interesting character to me has to be the primary antagonist, Satou - while he is a bit cliche, he pulls off his evil, manipulative ways in a way that even makes me think twice about his actions - that is until he goes mass murder mode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nWhat can I say more than \"I really enjoyed it\"? Sure it wasn't the most amazing anime I've watched, but it's also the first anime in a while which I've actually bothered to watch from episode 1 to the final episode. It keeps you on your toes, and is a refreshing change to all those poorly made teenage high school comedy animes that are all too many.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nThere are a few times in this anime where I thought, \"what? how does that work?\", but the overall premise of the show is delivered well. Have I watched an anime like this before? Probably. Can it be a bit cliche at times? Yes. But is it unique? Yes - in an age where a good anime plot becomes increasingly more difficult to think of, and remakes are the norm, it pulls off an original concept without the stench of an overcomplicated and overthought storyline that too many animes these days try to accomplish.\\n",

            "content": "\u201cAjin\u201d is the \u201cBatman: Arkham Knight\u201d (PC) of anime.\r\nThis show is broken. The show visually assaults your eyes. Visuals are important in visual entertainment. Dismissing visuals in visual entertainment is like dismissing food at a restaurant. You may be influenced to go somewhere because the service rocks, but you won\u2019t go if the food is horrible. The visuals are incompetent at best. I\u2019m going to put this in terms that many people on this site will understand. Some gaming companies restrict games to 30 frames per second (FPS) because they want their game to be more \u201ccinematic\u201d. People complain that games below 30 FPS isnot suitable for many games. Frame rates under 30 FPS is regarded as a sign of lacking quality. \u201cAjin\u201d took this concept of low frames as being cinematic and ran with it. They tried to be super cinematic with frame rates dipping below 10 FPS. In scientific terms, this does not even pass the critical flicker fusion frequency. Human eyes/brains register 24 FPS as a fluid motion. Movies are usually shot in 24 FPS and repeat frames to synthesize a 30 FPS motion.  Please have the courtesy of doing a little research and finding out what the bare minimum is for entertainment targeted for humans. This is the first time I have ever had a headache after watching something. The manga has more frames per second than this horrible adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is so horribly animated that the studio acknowledges their professional impotence. I\u2019m not talking about how the 5th episode is deservedly named \u201cTrash\u201d. Although in that episode Satou regenerated an arm, pulled his arm out from under him, and shot a dude in a literal 1 frame. In chapter 19 of the manga, Satou was supposed to fly a plane into the building. They knew they couldn\u2019t animate an airplane smoothly so they gave us a different alternative. We got an explosion and Satou riding the building down. The concept of him riding the building down was legit, but it is wrong. People will argue that the animators were being sympathetic towards Americans by not showing the plane like how Pok\u00e9mon did, but there is another scene where the animators pushed the action out of the scene. Earlier in the series, a train hit a car and pushed the car out of the frame so they could blow the car up without having to animate it.  There was a helicopter that blew up off screen because effort is too much to ask for. If the animators cared about their \u201cart\u201d they would not allow the \u201cplease buy our DVD/Blu-ray\u201d halfway through every episode. This ad goes on for a full minute and takes up nearly half the screen. There are reasons that this advertisement doesn\u2019t show up in other shows. Any self-respecting animator would be outraged by the blanketing of their animation. People try to defend CG when it is poorly executed in shows they like, but that is being a zealot. Quality doesn\u2019t have sacrificed because the animation style is being experimented with. Over 2 decades ago Aardman Animation, the studio that brought us the British anime \u201cWallace and Gromit\u201d, has made clay move far smoother than CG because Aardman Animation actually cares about their work and puts time into their art. \\n\\n\r\nThe show does deserve some credit. The orchestrated pieces are put perfectly in place. I like Japanese Justin Timberlake in the intro song. The creators of this show are probably good with the ladies, because the mood is set for every scene. Satou is a great bad guy. He wants the world to burn and he has a great personality. You understand his rage and malcontent with how humans have treated him and he wants back at them. The show is best when Satou is around. The story is awesome. Everyone who has seen the anime or read the manga will agree that the story is cool. Corrupt government, explosions, stands (black ghosts), and Satou are all great things to have in a storyline. Great job on the story for knowing who is interesting and when they are interesting. Most people watch stuff for the main character, but Kei takes a backseat in the story so the show can focus on the larger issues. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the show is a failure. Polygon Pictures horribly executed an adaptation. It is ambitious to animate humans with CG and the studio is not technically adept enough to execute smooth motion with it. Polygon Pictures joins the ranks of the garbage studios. Studio Deen, Idea Factory, and even KOO-KI could make this show better than Polygon Pictures. It makes me sad that the promotional videos for the new \u201cBerserk\u201d anime will also look like an unfinished project. Guts, if he were real, would bitch slap all those animators in the face with \u201cDragonslayer\u201d for disgracing the well-deserved number 1 rated manga on this site. Real fans hold standards to their favorite series. If the anime does the manga justice, you should love and cherish it. When they fail at it, the fans should voice their disappointed opinions. Fans do not change their profile picture to a character from the show while rating and reviewing the show at a 10 when they have only seen 4 episodes of the series. \\n",

            "content": "\"Don't judge a book by its cover\": a phrase that I'm sure many of us are familiar with, being one that has long transcended both generational and ethnic background to be used across the globe. A phrase that has taken on several reiterations, but still maintains the same direct message. It's simple, to the point, and always relevant when entering the world of any storytelling medium. As much as many of us would like to think that we could quickly discern the contents of a show solely off of the art cover and synopsis, there are times when we are all proven wrong. \r\nTake theoutward appearances of Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica and Gakkougurashi! for example. Both titles display an outer shell that could be described as innocent or even a bit too cloying upon first encounter. Had any veteran anime viewer taken a glance at them with no prior knowledge, it could be easy to understand if they had fallen for the fa\u00e7ade. When any viewer becomes accustomed to familiarized signs in certain anime they've experienced before, it isn't out of character for complacency to kick in. \\n\r\nWhether we want to or not, past experiences tend to lead to some subconscious rewiring of expectations for individual content we perceive later on. It's how we refine our viewing habits and why we tend to avoid certain things that set off red flags in our heads due to unsavory experiences. It's a primal reaction our ancestors had to avoid danger and one we adopted for more trivial things, like avoiding shows that aren't in our favor. It's a habit with polarizing results, but still, an understandable one we all share in one way or another. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if one were to glance at the outward appearance of Ajin, I'm sure the prenotion to judge it would take hold quickly. With promotional art and a premise that seem to enforce the trappings of a typical bishounen action romp, it isn't hard to see why that knee-jerk reaction to label it would occur. But what we see on the outside, and what we actually get, is a whole other story. While Ajin may pattern itself to other shows of that caliber, it quickly deviates from the tropes associated with it to become something far more promising. This anime is a book that screams one thing while the pages on the inside reveal another. \\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in a fictional universe where humanity stumbled upon the discovery of a new sub-species of beings dubbed the Ajin. Having the appearance of regular humans, the Ajins are thought to be immortal, while also possessing several supernatural abilities. Due to their documented cases' being extremely rare, they quickly become subjects of superstition. But all that changes when a resurgence of the species occurs in modern day Japan, bringing with it a new public frenzy that leads us into the narrative that unfolds before us today.\\n\\n\r\nWhat we have here is a fundamental case of man vs. \"allegorical\" man, something many of us is familiar with, whether we're aware of it or not. Every time there's a story that pits opposing ideals of beings capable of human-level thought, (whether that be man or beast), it follows the man vs. man conflict. This isn't always limited to one conflict either, as multiple topics tend to branch out from its inception, as demonstrated with movies like Dances With Wolves, or Cameron's Avatar, for the modern viewing audience. It's the tale of societal discrimination and xenophobic rejection of anything that doesn't align with someone's own principals. These are the stories that advocate awareness by providing social commentary with the human condition being used as its platform. \\n\\n\r\nThese familiar tales are no stranger to the world of anime. You don't have to look far, with titles such as Parasyte and Shinsekai Yori adhering to this traditional narrative, both of which serve as ambassadors in anime's ability to craft this tale just as efficiently as anything found on the silver screen. But despite the commonality of these stories, it's still one that's easily botched when handled with little finesse, with titles such as Tokyo Ghoul and Terra Formars being testaments to that fact. Thankfully, Ajin isn't a case of the latter, although, I do hesitate to place it on the caliber of the prior entries mentioned that did this narrative right. If I had to give a comparative evaluation, I'd say it finds itself somewhere comfortably in the middle. \\n\\n\r\nWhile not as fleshed out as Shinsekai Yori or as multifaceted as Parasyte, Ajin still manages to hold its own. Instead of letting the subject matter marinate in the subconscious of the viewer, Ajin makes swift actions to drive home the messages quickly it wishes to convey. This gives room for a narrative that's always in motion, which is ideal for those seeking immediate results. And while this to-the-point approach may leave many of its concepts explored only on a surface level, it still allows for a more consumable binge-watching experience as a result. It prioritizes thrills over thematic pondering, which makes it more accessible to a broader market. This also makes Ajin an excellent gateway for those who want just to get their toes wet with heftier concepts, but aren't quite ready to dive in just yet. It sprinkles in commentary about our current populace's desensitized state, as well as touching upon ethical treatment taken by governing bodies. It does just enough to whet the appetite of the viewer and add flavor to its narrative. And for those who want just a little bit extra with their action, this might just be all that's needed. But despite that fact, there's still a barrier of entry for those willing to crack the spine of this anime, and that, of course, is the usage of 3DCG animation.\\n\\n\r\nDeciding to use 3DCG, similar to that of Knights of Sidonia, was probably the most significant deterrent for those who saw past the generic premise and appearance. And in all honesty, just hearing this news alone was perhaps the reason many overlooked this title altogether. Yes, the presentation can take some getting use to for viewers who don't find it aesthetically appealing, but for those not bothered by the occasional uncanny valley effect, the show remedied this problem better than most. Unlike Knights of Sidonia, the individual movements here show far more mobility. The soundtrack, composed of Gothic organs, booming Hans Zimmer-esque fog horn sections, heavy guitar riffs and more, also helped in compensating in places where the animation found itself lacking. It might not be by much for viewers who are bothered by even the thought of CGI, but it certainly made it a far more palatable experience for those that could see beyond that.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights that occurred throughout the series weren't reduced to two people smashing fists with no rational thought but are rather tactical bouts where Ajins and humans alike use their strengths and weaknesses against each other. Even with the apparent advantage given to the Ajins, the human opposition still found many clever ways of exploiting their powers by using it against them. This was also the case for when Ajins clashed among themselves. The show went into a decent amount of detail in explaining the body mechanics of the Ajins as well as the extent of their abilities. And the more an Ajin was aware of its strengths, the better it was at utilizing it in and outside the battlefield.\\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the clearest demonstration of the show's deviation from its inherent trappings can be found with the main characters themselves. In order to avoid turning this into a long-winded analysis, I'll go over only the two prominent figures highlighted throughout the show. They were far from being the most fully-realized characters of the 2016 Winter season (that honor resides with Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu); however, they were still far removed from the cookie-cutter lineup that would come standard-fare with these stories. And what they may have lacked in development, they more than made up for with their distinct personality traits and interactions. They're simple, but at the same time, subjects which would make for interesting, if only brief, character studies.\\n\\n\r\nTake, for example, our main character, Kei Nagai. The first defining trait he exhibits immediately separates him from the atypical wide-eyed idealist or the hot-blooded teen that come almost default with his role. Instead of a rehashed archetype with only a different coat of paint to define him, what we get is a selfish misanthrope who places his own self-preservation and needs above others. Whether he had to be deceptive or fake empathy to weasel his way out of trouble territory isn't of concern to him. There are no delusions of grandeur festering in his mind; he is very much aware of the extent of his capabilities, as well as his amoral standing with the world around him. And while not entirely being pegged as a nihilist, he doesn't place trust in anything that isn't an irrefutable truth. Kei Nagai is a teen whom we've either seen or were at one point in our lives, which makes him one of the most honest depictions of this age group in some time. Unless he's given a feasible or self-beneficial option to assist someone, he will not go out of his way to aid them if it means placing his own life in harm's way. Anything outside of that is merely done out of forced guilt or social obligation. This underrepresented type of character makes him far from your garden variety, and as a result, an intriguing one to follow.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as much as some of us would like to take the moral high road in response to other people's suffering, the truth is most of us don't acknowledge it with any substantial sympathy. And it's for this reason that our protagonist becomes not only well-depicted but also easily identifiable for our modern society. Now, this isn't to say some won't find his actions deplorable; there are certainly lots of people out there with a healthy moral fiber, but his personality and actions are properly documented for the audience to understand his psyche, regardless of one's own personal ethics. He isn't going to fulfill the role of any white-knight advocate anytime soon, but in the context of the story he's placed in, his personality is tailor-made for the current social climate.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while Kei Nagai retains the central character role, the true star of the series was none other than Satou. Satou, also nicknamed \"The Hat\" by officials, is quite the enigmatic figure. With a hospitable, soft-spoken demeanor upon initial contact, he brings with himself an aura of accumulated wisdom, but lurking just below the surface of his thinly veiled smile lies a man with a very twisted moral compass. Like the hybrid of a cunning old fox and someone akin to that of Magneto from the X-men franchise, there's nothing he won't do to reach his intended goal. While wanting for the betterment of his Ajin brethren, the path he takes to get there is paved with the blood of opposition and bystanders alike, all while sadistically reveling in the madness he brews up. He's a charismatic demon in sheep's clothing, a man who nonchalantly goes about his business with no sign of remorse, which is made all the more menacing given his weathered age. Any youth can demonstrate raw ferocity towards someone, but it's the carefully calculated approach of a much older man that strikes fear into the officials in this series. Satou, for all intents and purposes, is the show's undisputed badass, a title he more than lives up to. \\n\\n\r\nAnother character worth briefly addressing was Yuu Tosaki, an official who balances out the opposing ideals of Satou and Kei. He's your \"all business no pleasure\" kind of detective who is given the task to apprehend the Ajins by any means necessary. While he came across as one note, in the beginning, that is later alleviated with the reveal of his motivation. Outside of Yuu Tosaki, the rest of the secondary characters aren't fleshed out to any extent, but they are given distinct enough personality traits to make their inclusion warranted. All in all, the characters, whether essential or minor, helped in bringing the world and conflict to life. \\n\\n\r\nThis title proves that even action shows can have some level of thought and planning placed into them. It never tried to be something far more than what it was and performed well with the material it had to work with. For those thinking that this would be just another bishounen-cock-fight title, I implore you to discard that premature notion and give this show a try.\\n\\n\r\nThere was never a dull moment while watching this anime. With a plot that continued to push forward and main characters that always kept me on the edge of my seat, I found a great deal of enjoyment here. Satou's actions alone were more than enough for me to power through it. While the art was a bit off-putting at times, it never got in the way of me enjoying any part of the series. In terms of quality, it's somewhere between Tokyo Ghoul and Parasyte. If TG were McDonalds and Parasyte were a 5-star restaurant, then Ajin would be your local diner.\\n\\n\r\nAjin was a show that could have easily dissipated under the weight of its own premise but managed to hold up incredibly well. With narrative choices and thoughtful insight that demonstrated a level of competency lacking in similar titles, Ajin has proven to be a show worth the initial investment. And with everything being taken into consideration, Ajin has become one of the few documented cases of an \"edgy shounen\" being done right.",

            "content": "Ajin- What Tokyo Ghoul Wanted to Be... and failed miserably at!\r\nAjin- also the most unfairly ignored series of Winter 2016. There, it's been said. If you were one of the few people who can see past a childish, baseless, and unwarranted dislike of 3D CGI based anime on principle- good for you, because Ajin delivers a quality sci-fi/superpower tale, regardless of the form it's rendered in. \r\nBecause it's first on everyone's mind- the first thing to address here is the animation. Yes, 3D CGI can be scary. We've all seen monstrosities of bad animation like the ASS dragon from Fate Stay Night, the original Ghostin the Shell SAC, Absolute Duo, and many others. Yes, we're all fully aware of how ugly that plastic shader looks. To that end, Ajin can be ugly- and the worst part is the framerate, which is very sluggish at times and drags the visual experience down. However, for a show that was rendered entirely in 3D, this is not the end of the world. The majority of it is very easy to watch and flows well- and given the dark subject material, how it's cast in a washed out, at some points almost grayscale color scheme, but the few bright moments seem brighter by comparison in an otherwise pretty dreary show. \\n\\n\r\nThe next thing I feel led to discuss are the comparisons to Tokyo Ghoul that I alluded to in the title. The subject matter here is quite similar, only with Ajin taking a step toward realism and making good on its threats, minus the terrible teen angst and melodrama. See, the Ajin are a small group of humans who have the ability to regenerate their bodies upon dying. No matter how gruesome their injuries, they always come back to life in a few seconds- making them almost entirely invincible. Because they're also human, they have similar fallibility to crippling, choking, or otherwise being incapacitated. To further complicate matters, they're also able to summon an invisible, (to everyone who is not an Ajin) but humanoid black specter which can be used as a proxy and controlled remotely- to do combat, spy, whatever. The catch is that they can only use this once or twice per day, before needing to regenerate. \\n\\n\r\nThe Ajin are, because of the actions of one man named Satou, hunted by the government- resulting in a sort of class warfare, the nearly invincible Ajin VS the police and special agents whose job it is to control knowledge of and movements of the Ajin- all deemed a national threat from the terroristic operations of the murderous Satou- a broken psychopath with para-military training who exists for no purpose other than to incite fear and shock into the populace of Japan through killing- which he thoroughly enjoys. \\n\\n\r\nHowever much this story may be about Satou though, the main character he is not. \\n\r\nKei Nagai, a student who reminds me a lot of Light Yagami, albeit with a much more human mind and cold streak, is involved in a bus accident walking home from school. Smeared on the ground along with his life blood and organs, and dead- this black smoke appears from his body and a crackling sound is heard. Kei sits up, clothes torn from grinding along the road underneath the bus- very alive. Kei recognizes immediately that he's an Ajin, and that his life has just changed dramatically- most likely for the worst. His friends freak out, and then there's a knock at the door. Kei recognizes that it's time to go, and he, who just wants to live quietly and away from the Ajin madness, takes off on the run. Kei is, and shows that he's different from many superpower shonen main characters in that he's a very calculating, cold person. He's not afraid to use anyone or anything in his path if he sees it as a means to get ahead, and through this, he manages to slip under the radar, even if it costs him his friends and family, his force of will and intellect are what keep him alive after the government gets on his scent. \\n\\n\r\nSee, the world of Ajin is built up very well from the beginning, featuring students in school gossiping about this viral video, supposedly featuring an Ajin being murdered over and over by shady government officials. We later see news broadcasts with the names of suspected Ajin and recognize that there's a very large gap of information missing to the public about what they really are. This introduction (in a realistic way) of the public intrigue is very natural feeling, and sets the stage for a socio-political facet to the show later on, with government coverups and information war. \\n\\n\r\nOn this note, it should be noted that this show really pushed the envelop of gritty content, at least in recent memory, especially in how it presents some of the violent acts. It's never my place to spoil anything, but suffice to say that Satou takes some very drastic and destructive measures (all within the realm of reality, mind you) to make Japan very aware of his presence and the threat he poses as both an Ajin and terrorist. Likewise, the story does a great job of making everything very morally gray, with abuses of power by the government and shrewd manipulations by Satou to shift the public opinion of the ignorant masses towards the plight of the Ajin. \\n\\n\r\nAs a dark, engaging, and interesting shonen, Ajin is definitely one of the more memorable of the genre in recent memory. It took many of the themes that Tokyo Ghoul had breadth in, and then gave them depth. Where Tokyo Ghoul was afraid to take steps, or just completely missed steps, especially with its characters, we have much stronger motivation and reaction from the characters here. The plot advances in a way that can be followed, but not in the most predictable fashion, with a couple of genuinely shocking scenes to boot. Though this 13 episode series doesn't completely wrap up the story (that will be left to a sequel movie sometime later this year, a la Madoka Magica), it ends on a satisfying enough note that I wasn't perturbed by its somewhat abrupt ending. I'm willing to give this my stamp of approval, and even go so far as to say that it's the unsung anime of the season for staying true to what it began, not pulling any punches, and remaining consistently good throughout its run- something no other show from this past season can claim.",

            "content": "It\u2019s pretty much like a horror movie. Ajin uses a lot of ideas borrowed from horror lecture and fiction. These include ancient monsters (the Ajins), government hunting them down, and a dark story about how a young man\u2019s life changing forever after getting involved with them. Based on the manga of the same name, Ajin is more or less a thrilling story. \r\nTo clear things up straight, there\u2019s actually a film trilogy as well based on this series. The second and third film has yet to be released (at the time this review was written). The TV anime adaptation reflects on a deeper storytelling withsome additional aspects. Although based on the first film, the TV anime adaptation still remains largely unchanged. The story begins with a young man named Kei Nagai. He is living in a world where Ajin exist, demi-humans that have existed almost 17 years ago first found in Africa. They are considered a world wonder as many people fear them yet also consider them very special. This is where Kei\u2019s story comes in as he realizes that he is far from normal.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, the show was rather predictable at first. The first few episodes heavily hints that there\u2019s something wrong with Kei and that his connection with the Ajin runs deeper than he thinks. It turns into a cat-and-mouse game scenario where police, government, and other individuals are after him. Even his friends betray him so that they can reap the awards of capturing an Ajin. The only ally he has at first is Kaito, a delinquent friend that he\u2019s known from school. But truthfully, the reality is that the only person he can trust is himself. As the story progresses, we see the darker side of humanity and Kei himself even undergoes changes. It\u2019s not made specifically clear though if he was always cold or became more aware afterwards. Either way, the show explores his character in ways that drastically contrasts with his personality when first introduced. The interesting part about Kei also shows what it really means to survive. In their world, it\u2019s to kill or be killed because apparently, being captured by the government pretty much guarantees death. Don\u2019t believe me? Just ask science.\\n\\n\r\nAs a dark story, the characters in this series also explores the darker side of what humans are capable of. Scientists at facilities are tasked with discovering the secrets of Ajin and immorality so test subjects are usually tortured for information and data. Then, there are noticeable characters like Satou who strives to do anything to get what he wants including killing innocents with little value of human life. The question makes us wonder who the real monsters are: Ajin or humans like him. Even Kei\u2019s sister seems to have forsaken him as she thinks him as a monster. Satou\u2019s ambition to rule the country with his twisted goals also makes him a cruel sociopath with intelligence and resources. In ways, he is somewhat similar to Kei as both lacks empathy to kill and unafraid to die. Both are also quite reckless in their actions as well and often willing to take risks to get what they need. As the story progresses, other characters including those willing to participate in terrorism are introduced in the series to really show how twisted some humans can be.\\n\\n\r\nAs you may have guessed by now, the show isn\u2019t very much for the lighthearted. There\u2019s little to no room for comedy and the story itself is not afraid to kill of characters at the click of its fingers. There\u2019s hardly any humans that we can feel sympathy for throughout the show as well. Even Tosaki and his assistant Izumi can be hard to get attached to as they are active members to track down Ajins. So in essence, it should be recognizable that the show is hard to get people to like its characters. I think the only character that can be considered a valuable friend would be Kaito. He is selfless and often takes daring risks to help out others including putting his own life at stake to help out Kei. Unfortunately, he is perhaps just a very small part of kindness in their dark world. Meanwhile, the show pushes the idea of humans capable of being the real monsters. The downside is that it\u2019s what we see mostly on paper rather than a deeper insight on their characters. The manga does a better job at adapting characterization such as with characters like Satou.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I wasn\u2019t a fan of the CGI artwork of the show at first. Polygon Pictures helms the show with their production and it\u2019s evident that they utilizes what they are capable of. However, I think the CGI works quite well in the end. Action remains fluid and more detailed with Ajins\u2019 fighting capabilities. It also gives them a more terrifying appearance with added aesthetics such as special effect particles. The character designs seems more or less average though. But if you\u2019re looking for violence, Ajin excels exactly at doing what it is and that\u2019s showing delivering bloodshed. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is effective and as the show progresses, it gets more noticeable especially during more tense moments. For most of the story, we have to remember that Kei is running away from society as people seek to capture him. The OST and music works effectively to showcase the story of this cat-and-mouse game scenario. Adding to the eerie music, we also get good voice acting like with Satou\u2019s sadistic and sarcastic personality. Kei\u2019s change also becomes noticeable as his voice mannerism becomes more cold and lack of empathy. The show also does a neat job with both the OP and ED theme too with stellar choreography.\\n\\n\r\nWhat to expect from Ajin in the end? A more compressed story that exploits the darker side of humanity. It\u2019s a series that isn\u2019t exactly fun to watch if you\u2019re not a fan of cruel experimentation, government conspiracies, and betrayals. However, the show does a fairly good job at telling its story. Despite some lack of characterization, Ajin handles its themes well and keeps the viewers at their seats to anticipate what\u2019s to come next. Every episode expands more on the story while focusing on the most important elements. For anyone who is interested in some supernatural horror fiction, this is definitely something to look out for. And to be honest, it\u2019s quite a thrill.",

            "content": "Ajin is a more violent X-Men but it's nitty gritty without displaying the brutality and crossing the line toward torture porn (if you don't count the X-Men graphic novels). The protagonist, Kei Nagai, is a pacifist yet he's deeply flawed. He calculates every move he makes and, if something doesn't directly effect him, he doesn't care enough to take action. Whether or not the world is in turmoil, Kei just wants to live in peace. As the roster of characters grow, the story develops into a question of whether or not the many is worth protecting\u2014even if it means the same (if not, more) sufferingfor those who are oppressed.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is superb at confronting real world problems such as bigotry, capitalism, and other politics. I love that a lot of the violent sequences is implied instead of illustrating it entirely for shock value. Antagonists come with all kinds of motives and every one of them makes the audience think, \"Their actions are more understandable now.\" Not morally right, but understandable given their circumstances. There are basically no plot holes worth mentioning. Every character has a reason for their actions.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire production was masterfully thought out\u2014from the writing, to the animation. I have to give major kudos to the animation team because the art direction is beautiful and seamless. The way Polygon Pictures utilized 3D animation to give their world and characters more life is incredible. Their style makes every movement more realistic and incredibly fluid. This coupled with the sound and music production makes this one of the most cohesive anime out there. Ajin is well paced while keeping up with the high tension. Polygon took tons of risks with plenty of rewarding payback. Strongly recommended!",

Looking past absolutely terrible graphics, you find a surplus of characters developed so poorly that there is no reason to be invested in the (mediocre) plot whatsoever. \r\nAjin tries to be a grungy sci-fi about a handful of poorly treated immortals who can control a \u201cblack ghost\u201d or IBM. Unfortunately, the main character, whose name I have already forgotten, is so all over the place in the course of this short season that he could do literally anything and it would be deemed \u201cin character.\u201d We get almost no context for why any of the characters aredoing what they are doing, and if we do get context, it\u2019s vague and sloppy. Any hints at character development or people switching sides goes unused or dropped, and execution of the plans and schemes and terrorism that keep the plot going are tired and rushed excuses of every other good terrorist/smart main character shows we've seen.

            "content": "Ohh Ajin, hahaha... where do I start this great anime.\r\nWell, let's just start, with, Yeah, the CGI is cringy to watch as f*** according to those watchers who've seen Ajin. But, boy oh boy, the story is a Roller Coaster ride filled with twists who is the real villain at the first half of this anime, to the another twists if the protagonist is a hero or an anti-hero.\r\nI can't help myself on how this anime reminds me of \"Tokyo Ghoul\", both have to face their fate on how they die and how they survive in the process, how they learn that they have powersto revive themselves, and how they we're tortured. However, comparing to TG's Kaneki Ken and Ajin's Nagai Kei, Kei's character here is somewhat dreadful and reveals that he's the worst guy as the protagonist of this story. According to the characters that are affiliated with Kei, he's a trash and he doesn't care anyone for himself. That's why in this anime, Kei is cold-blooded and doesn't care anything and anyone surrounds him. But that everything changes when he left home after learning he's an Ajin, saving the ones who tortured him and bumping to an old lady. But still keeping his rotten personality until a little development change within him over the next half of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot here is kinda messy, at first I was like, \"Who's the REAL bad guys here? Is it the government or the rebels?\" and the second one was like \"Is Kei a Bad guy or a good guy?\" A lot of questions are circulating here in this anime, which is why I felt curious until I find the answers there few episodes later. As a matter of fact, I kinda like how the story goes, including how messy it is and then put it one by one like a jigsaw puzzle until it completely clears the picture why and how they do it. It's a mystery anime, and this is what I was looking for all this time! I really do like this kind of stuff, and this one is, without a doubt, a GOOD STUFF! Also, the action, BY GAWD the action is pretty intense too! Especially how the man with the hat named Satou delivers a good blow against the Police during the terror attacks. \\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, Ajin is a pretty piece of action anime that you surely need to watch out for. The action is pretty great and the plot was fantastic! It might be sound biased, but you should try it out and see it for yourself. Especially if you're a fan of action and mystery anime. Nevermind the CGI arts or whatnot. The plot here is pretty interesting to say the least. So go get it NOW!",

            "content": "Judging from its current popularity, and how it is ranked, I'd say it is severely underrated at this current time. \r\nI'll first address what most people take fault with in this anime. The art.\r\nAdmittedly, when I first started watching, I was put off by the CG animation, as it is not something I am used to. That however is not saying that I didn't quickly warm up to it. The style of animation allows for character movements to be incredibly realistic.  I am however willing to admit that the backgrounds could do with some touching up. \r\nThe story is engaging, and easy to follow,but most of all, it is suspenseful. I can't really delve further into that without giving away any spoilers, so I'll just leave it at that.\\n\r\nThe sound is excellent. The music in particular really suits the sense of desperation that haunts the main character every step of the way.\\n\r\nAs for the characters themselves, they are incredibly interesting and/or likable. The main antagonist, Satou isn't just an average villain, doing things for the sake of being evil. He does things for very understandable reasons. Even Tosaki isn't the average, \"big bad government agent.\" He makes mistakes, and takes things into his own hands to get results, which makes him, like Satou, unique and identifiable.  The main character Kei Nagai is also pretty interesting. He isn't your typical generic kind but angsty teen hero. Kei is actually kind of a cold asshole, something that isn't common among anime mains, which is something I found quite refreshing. (Although I know a few people who kind of hate Kei as a result.)\\n\r\nAjin season 1 kept me on the edge of my seat, and always wanting to know what happens next. I am very glad I watched this, and it is a shame to see that it has slipped under a lot of peoples' radar. It definitely deserves more recognition and I am looking forward to the next season.",

            "content": "Let me start by apologising, somehow I got the mistaken impression that 91 Days was a horror anime, which it isn't. I'ts a historical thriller. For those of you who were looking forward to my reviewing that, I'll review it in November, but for the moment, let's talk about an actual horror anime. To  be specific, let's talk about Ajin. A supernatural horror mystery from Polygon Pictures. Based off of the manga from Sakurai Gamon. I have no idea what to expect from it. I haven't heard anything about it. Let's delve into it. \r\nStory:\r\nThe titular Ajin look human, act human and think ofthemselves as human. The key differences are that Ajin can't die. Every time they take mortal damage, a black mass swirls around them and they resurrect. Ajin can also summon black humanoid shapes that are invisible to human eyes. There are rumours about the Ajin. Some say that the government offers a reward of a hundred million yen to anyone who helps capture one. Some say they're subjected to cruel and inhumane experiments once they're captured.  Nagai Kei is a quiet, studious lad who doesn't much care for people. After an accident, he learns that he is, in fact, an Ajin. Now, the government is after him and he's on the run, convinced that there's some truth to the rumours. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw with this series is that it doesn't really develop its ideas that well. It'll spend a little time with something and then move on to the next thing without ever returning to flesh out the previous thing. The consequence is that there are a lot of plot points that are allowed to drop and others that could have been considerably more interesting, but aren't given time to build up because they really wanted to get to the next big moment. Not like the big moment they were on mattered that much. It's also worth noting that the \u201chorror\u201d of this series is largely just that it has supernatural creatures. There's all of one moment in the entire thirteen episodes that actually kind of works as horror. \\n\\n\r\nIn spite of that, I do like the idea of the series. I like that it has moral ambiguity with neither side of the conflict being moral. And neither one is morally questionable in some over the top or cartoonish way. They have motivations that legitimately work, given the scenario. The narrative does also do a good job of keeping you interested in what's coming next. In spite of its tendency to rush things. Its very good at ending its episodes at just the right moment to get the audience interested in what's coming next. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis series is somewhat reminiscent of Phantom: Requiem in that it doesn't have any morally good characters, mostly. It has a couple side characters who seem genuinely like good, supportive people. Its major characters, in contrast, are very much a self-centred group. Each of whom is willing to do terrible things if it serves them or helps  them towards their goal. That being said, it is interesting to watch how they respond when their interests clash and they do, largely, come across as actual people, at least in terms of personality. It's also kind of interesting that so many of them act out of desperation at various points in the narrative.  That being said, the dynamics don't always work. A big example is Kei and Kaito. We  basically see flashbacks of how they used to be friends a long time ago and, somehow, it  left such an impact that Kaito is willing to risk himself for Kei. Even though Kei's literally spent years ignoring him. If their relationship troubles had been a recent development, it might be believable, but with that much time it comes across as really contrived. They really  needed to show us more of their relationship and why it means so much to Kaito even after all this time, which does tie into the series' general problem of rushing ahead without developing things properly. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this isn't very good. Its not that it uses obvious CG, it's that it uses obvious CG that looks to be at about the level of a Playstation 2 game, and not one like Final Fantasy XII that looked really nice. No, it looks like an early PS2 game when developers weren't even close to pushing the system's limits. It's more than a little distracting to see those visuals when they're trying to have a serious moment. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe vocal cast in this is pretty good. Miyano Mamoru, Ootsuka Houchuu, Hosoya Yoshimasu, Komatsu Mikako & Sakurai Takahiro are all good in this. Kanno Yugo did the  music for  the series and it's decent enough. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't any. Nor is there romance in the series in general, save for one character's motivation. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Ajin is okay. It has some good ideas and it is interesting, but rushing from one major plot point to the next hurts it. As does the generally weak artwork.  If the series had had twenty episodes and spent more time on its important plot points, it could have been really good. Unfortunately, it doesn't have that time. So, it's rushed, but still decent enough. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. If the premise sounds interesting and you can forgive the artwork, you might get into it. Next week I'll end this year's horror month with Danganronpa 3: Zetsubou-hen. In the meantime, keep your fabulosity gauge filled.",

            "content": "In fiction, threats to humanity usually end in one of two ways.  Either humanity bands together to wipe out the threat out of fear, or humanity gets taken over the threat and lives in fear trying to protect themselves and their very survival.  In many shapes and forms, this concept has appeared in anime from Parasyte, to Attack on Titan, and all sorts of other shows that tackle similar concepts.  And today, we have Ajin, a show that once again throws this idea at us again, this time with people that are unkillable.  Oy vey, just kill me now for thisone.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Nagai Kei is a boy who lives in a world with beings known as 'Ajin'.  Ajin are rare being with the unexplainable powers to regenerate their entire bodies and can essentially cheat death as they can revive indefinitely.  No one really knows why the Ajin are around, except the fact that these beings are considered a threat to humanity, so on and so forth.  After being run over by a truck (Oh Truck-san), he and the rest of his town find out that Kei is an Ajin, and as such, sends this child into a whole new world where he is now hunted down for being a threat to humanity, despite really not doing anything. \\n\\n\r\nThe Ajin anime is more or less supposed to be a prologue to the Ajin movies that're supposed to be made later on this year.  True to its role, this anime plays out as a series that gives you information, but at the same time, withholds a lot of the story in order to keep viewer interest.  Now this here creates the biggest problem of this anime, information.  Ajin suffers a severe lack of information to the point that the series creates plot holes rather than mysteries.  A lot of the series revolves around the three players in this game of government and Ajin chess that has a lot missing pieces by the end of the series.  They hint a lot as to why each side does what they do, and their respective opinions on Ajin and what role Ajin should play in the world, but never give us concrete reasons as to why they choose the side that they do.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the events of the story are just really boring and confusing.  The first four episodes follow a chase scene.  Literally, it's just a chase scene.  That is not exciting.  Plus, the show switches to the three sides back and forth all the time, giving bits and pieces of the events of each respective side, and it's hard to keep track with what each side is really doing, especially since most of the the series is just discussion on the 'next plan' with only a couple scenes max of actual plan execution.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Ajin is just a prologue that doesn't give us enough information to create interest for the series.  There aren't many reasons to explain why the characters have the opinions they do, there isn't well enough pacing to fully explain or understand why such an event happens sometimes, and the series ends with a 'read the manga/watch the movies' ending, which is understandable for this series in particular since it IS a prologue, but after seeing the anime, I have NO interest to see any more of this trainwreck.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Terrible Pacing\\n\r\n-  Lack of character motivation\\n\r\n-  Choppy transitions from character perspective\\n\r\n-  Stories intentionally left incomplete to the point of plot holes\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As mentioned before, Ajin has three separate factions that each have their own 'leader' and set of underlings.  Just to get it out of the way, the 'underlings' as I will dub them are really plot-related and hold little to no worth in the series.  Sure, some of them do, but they're quickly forgotten, and are more or less forgettable since either our 'leader' characters just dispose of them, or they're just mindless tools at their disposal.  \\n\\n\r\nUp first is our newest member of the Ajin, Nagai Kei.  Kei is a very conflicting character from beginning to end.  He is explained to be a very emotionless and uncaring chaotic neutral sociopath who only sees opportunities to use people for his own benefit than give two shits about them.  Now as a concept, this is interesting, as he's not your typical 'positive' protagonist who wants to 'save everyone' with his powers but instead only wants to use his newfound abilities to his own benefit and existence.  Now this comes with a duo of conflicting aspects.  The first of which is the fact that he exhibits human emotions.  At times, Kei has bouts of actually giving a shit about people, and while that does instill some character growth, it comes off as some unexplained motives that as expected, don't do anything towards his character as a whole.  He goes right back to his sociopathic mood and the series more or less pretends that what he has done is unimportant.  In addition, Kei himself doesn't really have a motive.  The series doesn't explain what his plan is or what he does, and writes him in to more or less sit on the sidelines and wait for something to happen from the other two factions before springing into action.  He doesn't feel like he has any worth in this series, and for your supposed main character, this is a deadly mistake.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Tosaki, the sort of 'lawful good' character that the series has as the one in charge for 'killing' or 'taking care' of Ajin.  His whole character is wrapped around his sheer hatred for the Ajin, and his motivation for as to WHY he hates Ajin is very incomplete.  We get one scene to hint as to why he hates Ajin, but it's a very generic hint that doesn't give any specifics.  Sure, you can speculate, but at the same time, it's really lazy writing because even with that piece of information in mind, he just goes \"Kill Ajin, Kill Ajin, Kill Ajin\", so on and so forth.  He's one-dimensional and bland.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then finally, Satou, the experienced Ajin who plays the Chaotic Evil side to this equation.  Satou is insane, very, very, very insane.  He is insane to the point that there is no reason to explain as to why he is insane or how he became so messed up, and there's nothing beyond that.  His motives, like the other two, are missing as well.  Why does he want to commit genocide?  For fun?  Why does he say he wants to rule the country at the end?  What's his reason?  There're a lot of holes to Satou's character that don't add up.  The show makes it seem like there's more reason to him doing that than just wanting to cause mayhem, but they don't tell you or even allude to it.  He's just \"Rah! I'm an Ajin!  I'mma make ya'll dead!\" before laughing manically as he stands atop a falling building cause he can't die.  Crazy characters like this are cool and nice, but without any rhyme or reason as to why they are crazy, there's no point in giving a crap about them.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, characters are...incomplete.  Their sheer lack of any kind of motive makes it so that there is no one to root for.  There is honestly no reason to care about anyone since you don't know or understand the reasons for their actions.  Personally, I think the characters are more or less the biggest problem of this series more so than the story, and I could not care any less about them since as a viewer, I don't know WHO THEY ARE.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Horrendously lacking in character and motivation\\n\r\n-  Side cast are plot-related and largely unimportant\\n\\n\r\nArt: Polygon Pictures and their CGI came into the picture when animating Ajin, and personally, I'll put my own two cents out there, I despise this animation wholeheartedly.  I don't like complete CGI anime.  (Keep in mind, this part is a personal opinion, not me seriously critiquing the animation.)  \\n\\n\r\nLike Knights of Sidonia, Polygon Pictures comes to Ajin with their signature style of CGI animation with CGI rendered characters in a more or less hand-drawn setting.  The issue that comes with this style of animation comes with complications within the final product.  My problem with this comes more or less in the final few episodes of Ajin.  The rendering of the characters started to look choppy and the movement wasn't as fluid as it was previously.  In addition, there're some mouth movements and specifically facial expressions that looked nightmarish and just sort of awkward to look at.  Definitely not Polygon Picture's best work.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Polygon Pictures (This is depending on your take of the CGI artstyle.)\\n\r\n-     Lower quality towards the end of the series\\n\\n\r\nSound: In terms of music, the OP of Ajin is...actually one of, if not the one thing about this series that I genuinely liked.  The OP is this dark and foreboding action rock song that's at least to me, really nice to listen to.  It's not all that special in terms of memorabilia so it's more or less an acquired taste the way I see it.  The ED is a skippable track that really holds no worth.  I wouldn't care to listen to it again, since it just doesn't come off as an enjoyable song.  Nice visuals though.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Ah, Ajin.  When I first heard about you, I admit that I had a relatively decent amount of intrigue.  But after hearing how your entire animation was CGI, ooo, that was a kicker.  And yet, I persevered.  As the episodes kept rolling by, I'll be honest with you, I wanted to kill myself while watching this series, only to revive again when another episode came by, before killing myself all over again!  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?  \\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I hated it.  I had no clue, ZERO CLUE, as to what precisely was going on.  Sure, there was the general plotline, but there were so many underlying things happening in the works that I did not care for this series.  There are actually a total of 4-5 factions rather than 3 in this series, and they're just barely hinted at to the point I wondered why they even bothered with it in the first place.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nKei, the story, Satou, the animation, Tosaki, the lack of character motivation, basically everything this show had to offer just made me want to claw out my eyes.  It was horrendously boring to sit through the characters' discussions and plan their next stage of attack.  It was like Death Note, but without actually cool characters, a good story, or intricate plans that made each opposing side want to best each other in a game of mind chess.  Rather it was a complete mess that expected people to care about the latter movies that would come out 'explaining' what the series was going to be about which, I'm gonna make a prediction, won't do shit.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nNo.  No.  Don't do it.  This anime is terrible in its execution and only creates confusion in place of actual intrigue.  The lack of explanation creates so many plot holes that it becomes infuriating to watch rather than really gripping.  I would've liked to enjoy this despite my absolute loathing for complete CGI animation, but this series just gave me no reason to give a damn.  My opinion?  Skip it.",

If you guys are looking for something that will keep you on your toes and got confused time to time, you have found it. I can easily recommend this series. \r\nThe characters are complex enough to keep them interesting, especially the antagonist. I can say i favor him more than the main character. Pacing is fine enough, the story is intriguing, action is on the roof, mainly towards the end of the season. Try itout, you won't regret.",

There are plenty of characters introduced throughout the episodes being both good, and evil. The artwork is amazing, having deep and inky colors, awesome dynamic lighting, necessary motion blurring, absolutely no art mistakes to be seen, and is just loads of fun to watch. Audio is as good, being rich and deep, the audio quality and sound effects are quite unlike anything else in the anime\u2019s category and have a cinema-like feel. The intro and outro songs are both amazing, with theintro song being slightly fast-paced and outgoing, and the outro song being slower with a much softer tone. (P.S: The outro song is sung by the voice actor of Kei!).\\n\r\nThis anime is built up from a highly praised manga, and is flawless. Perfect art, perfect audio, perfect.. Everything. This anime has great potential to continue growing and is truly worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is recommended for people who like mixed action anime with mystery, horror, and more.",

            "content": "Ajin was one of those anime that received polarized views even before it started airing. Some were interested with the thrills is could give, while others were turned off by the use of CGI and the use of a familiar premise. However, if one could ignore or adjust to the CGI present in this series, they would be able to experience something much greater. Ajin is one of the best thriller anime to come out in recent time, and is easily of of the best of the winter season this year. It\u2019s cinematic presentation with a heavy amount of thrills is a fantastic experience nodoubt. And those who are fans of this genre couldn\u2019t be more pleased with Ajin\u2019s final results. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nAjin takes place in a setting where immortal human beings with supernatural abilities, known as Ajin, were discovered and society decided to eliminate them as they are a potential threat to humanity. Our protagonist, Kei, was a victim to a truck accident, which caused him to reveal his supernatural powers, revealing that he\u2019s an Ajin. The series focuses on Kei\u2019s story of being on the run, and the political and social views on Ajin. The premise is quite similar to some other anime of the same series, such as Tokyo Ghoul and Kiseijuu. However, Ajin manages to find its own name in this somewhat overused premise. The story managed to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout the series. It doesn\u2019t start to pick up until the third or fourth episode, but when it does pick up, it\u2019s insanely fun. The situations give to the characters of this series is very enjoyable and very intense. And the series also focuses on the political views of the situations and it\u2019s nice to see some focus on that. The series later felt like a battle between the government and the Ajin and how they can get as much people on their side. This take was definitely in interesting one, and they manage to create tension with this aspect of the story too. \\n\r\nStory: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nOne of the best things about Ajin is its presentation. With its writing, Ajin manages to create a more cinematic feel to it. It\u2019s perfect blend of music, cinematography, thrills and cliffhangers make this one hell of a ride. The pacing is also pretty good in the series. There is sufficient buildup given to the more thriller moments and during the action scenes, the pacing picks up rapidly. However, the third quarter of this series felt somewhat slow, especially after all those events that happened just episodes before. However, they do work well as buildup episodes for its final episodes. The focus of the series is also unique. Not only dies it focus on Kei\u2019s fugitive storyline, but also Satou\u2019s attempts of shaking society and making room for the Ajin species. Another really good this about Ajin is its consistent tone. For the entire series, Ajin manages to keep its thrills and dark presentation stable. The story does go into deeper matter such as politics and torture and the series manages to handle these well. And the present dark humor is also a delight. From Satou\u2019s remarks to Kei\u2019s \u201cIDGAF\u201d faces, the series manages to keep a slight humorous feel that relaxes the tension. \\n\r\nPresentation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nAjin features a great cast of characters that all stand out in their own way. The protagonist, Kei, is a really hard character to study. What first seemed like a typical helpless character, turned out to be a heartless and selfish character instead. The viewers go from sympathizing with him, to looking at him in disgust at times. The way the series foreshadows Kei\u2019s real characteristics was smartly done. Kei is the type of person who does good deeds not because its good, but because its right. Next we have Kei\u2019s best friend, Kaito, and he\u2019s also a pretty good character. Not much development is given to him, mainly because he doesn\u2019t play too big of a role in the overall story. Satou is easily one of the best things about this series. He\u2019s badass, he\u2019s brutal, he\u2019s ruthless, and he\u2019s so much fun. His ideologies are interesting and the actions he takes in order for Ajin to receive recognition is fun to watch. Then you have those governmental characters that are after these Ajin, such as Tosaki and Shimomura, and they succeed to be good supporting characters, even with their minimal role. \\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe art design is pretty good in Ajin. The atmosphere in the series was made to be very dark and gritty and it matches the content. The use of darker and bleached out colors, with its limited color palette. Was a really smart choice. The character designs are also fairly good. Kei\u2019s look matches both his helpless and ignorant sides. And Satoru\u2019s look can make him look both the gentleman and the *ssh*le. My major gripe with the art is the lack of details given to anything in the series, mainly due to its CGI. Architectures feel bland and lack detailing. Some surfaces, especially the grounds, feel very blurry. And at times, the CGI prevents the facial expressions to be clear or proper. \\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice about Ajin\u2019s animations is that it\u2019s CGI\u2026 completely. Some people do give it slack for being completely CGI, but personally, I think the CGI suited Ajin. The IBMs depicted in the series look super fluid and really makes the scene feel better. Even things like vehicle movements feel a lot better in its CGI format. That doesn\u2019t cover up the fact that the main use of CGI is to save time, effort and money. However, there are moments where the CGI doesn\u2019t look too good, such as character movements. Polygon Pictures isn\u2019t new to CGI. As a matter of a fact, the only work they have done are all in CGI. However, compared to most CGI products in anime, Ajin\u2019s one of the more polished ones. \\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Ajin is really good, which wasn\u2019t surprising considering the fact that this series has a good cast. You have Miyano Mamoru voice acting Kei, so it would be a joke saying that he didn\u2019t do a good job with Kei. Miyano does a fantastic job (of course) as he manages to make Kei look both helpless and arrogant. His \u201cIDGAF\u201d scenes were really well done. There\u2019s a torture scene involving Kei in this series and Miyano\u2019s voice acing skills really shine there. With his talent, he\u2019s able to make the viewers understand the pain the character is feeling. Fukuyama Jun, another extremely talented seiyuu, does Kou fantastically too. His character doesn\u2019t play too big of a role in this series, but with his limited role, he does really good. He\u2019s able to make the character feel humorous or serious whenever needed. Hosoya, Yoshimasa does a pretty good job as Kaito, even with his limited role. He does the best friend role pretty well. Ootsuka Houchuu does an excellent job as Satou, he can make his character looks wise and good or sadistic and evil when necessary. Sakurai Takahiro, who is another well-known seiyuu, does Tosaki really well. Other seiyuu such as Komatsu Mikako, Osaka Ryota and Suzaki Aya, all do a very well job too. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nWhere do I start with the music part of Ajin? The OP, \u201cYoru wa Nemureru kai?\u201d, is really catchy, upbeat, and it matches the series. It really sets the mood up for the series. The ED, \u201cHOW CLOSE YOU ARE\u201d is also very good. Unlike its more upbeat OP, the ED is more slower and its more relaxed (even if the visuals of the ED are rather the opposite). Ajin has some of the best background music you\u2019ll even hear. By the time I finished watching the third episode, I was begging to get hold of the soundtrack. The music really boosts up the thrills of the series. The beats are killer, especially when something really intense is happening in the series. The main theme of Ajin is absolutely fantastic as its upbeat, thrilling and nerve-wracking. Other tracks such as \u201cCrisis\u201d, \u201cGame\u201d, \u201cAgitation\u201d, and \u201cExecute\u201d are what makes this anime feel so much better. \\n\r\nMusic: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nAjin was one of the most enjoyable things to come from the winter season. It\u2019s thrilling and suspenseful. Its focus on not only Kei\u2019s fugitive life, but also the political situation of Japan after these incidents, makes the story even better. Its uniquely written protagonist and likeably written antagonist makes this series a lot better. The CGI at times did halt my experience with the series, but it\u2019s nothing too bad. The music in the series is one of the best I\u2019ve heard, and even if Ajin delivered nothing at all, at least I got myself a killer soundtrack. Plus, the series\u2019 cinematography and editing gives it a more cinematic experience, which increases the enjoyment of the series. And with the send of this series, I\u2019m dying for a second season already. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Ajin is one of those series that is worth checking out, especially those who are fans of the genre. Many people have skipped over this series because of the CGI or the lack of a proper release outside of Japan. But its thrilling storytelling with its cinematic feel makes a great experience. Plus, the use of music in the series is absolutely fantastic. The characters in the series is really good, particularly the main protagonist and antagonist. Its use of CGI is somewhat disappointing, especially during the more unpolished scenes. But it\u2019s content makes up for that easily. Overall, Ajin is something that shouldn\u2019t be judged just by key visuals and PVs, but rather with its great content. \\n\\n\r\n+ Very stylish as it has a cinematic vibe to it, with proper pacing and buildup \\n\r\n+ The main protagonist and antagonist are complexly made and enjoyable. \\n\r\n+ Plot focuses not only on Kei on the run, but Satou\u2019s attempts to shake society\\n\r\n+ Outstanding background music, and with its proper placement, the thrills increase. \\n\r\n- Takes a couple of episodes for it to get really interesting and break away from its somewhat overused premise\\n\r\n- Some of the CGI feels unpolished and makes the art lack details\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4/10",

            "content": "Okey, so this is my first written review. Ever.\r\nThe reason I chose to write this is because I've seen a lot of negative reviews about this anime.\r\nFirst of, I started watching this without being biased one way or another.\r\nIn other words, I had never heard of this anime or read anything about it, nor the manga.\r\nI was just happily scrolling my netflix one thursday night and Ajin came up.\r\nThe story sounded great so without looking it up or reading anymore than what was on the recap on netflix, I pressed play.\r\nThe plot, EXACLTY as great as I thought it would be. I love it, justright up my alley. I love the main character even though after 13 ep you still don't even begin do scratch the surface of Kei's depts and who he is or what he might become, which shows the potential this anime has! And yes, there is character development! Kei is a character you might not like in the first ep or even the third because there is so much happening that to understad and get to know Kei takes time, and it really keeps you hungering for the next episode!\\n\r\nKei is actully smart, which make you (well, me) like him A LOT. Its not one of those characters thats your typical two-dimensonal hero who just \"have to save everyone!\" who runs in, messes up, cries, gets some mystery power and saves the day because he got lucky- or gets saved by someone else and hopes that his power will come when his girlfriend is in trouble-type of guy. No, Kei is extremely smart, efficent but also kind and hounorble. In other words, he's a realistic type of guy and never makes you scream at your screen \"RUN ALREADY YOU STUPID HALFWIT!!!\". \\n\\n\r\nThe only negative thing (except it being just 13 ep!?!?!?!?) is, as you might have guessed, the art.\\n\r\nOr (I'm new to anime so forgive me), to me its not the ART itself. Because if you freeze the anime or look at it from at freezeframe point of view, I think the art is quite beautiful. Special, yes. But beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes it \"bad\" is, (again, new at this) the animation in itself?\\n\r\nIts like the characters and the flow and movement of all objects, charaters in particular, is just so... Awkward. Everytime I see the bodylanguage I think of those bobbled headed dogs, you know, the dolls you put on your office desk or something and the head bobs up and down?\\n\r\nOr it feels like watching a trailer of the sims 2.\\n\r\nThats how they move in the anime, and not just the characters.\\n\r\nSo yes, that ruined it a bit but after a few episoded I got (sort of) used to it.\\n\r\nNo, wait. Let me put it like this.\\n\r\nThe plot and characters were just too good to drop it or make me wanna stop just because the art was a bit \"bad\".\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, this is definately a new favourite! I REALLLYYYYYYY loved the plot and characters and I can't wait for a second season!!! \\n",

I'm not realy a fan of the art, but thats just my opinion, the characters are a bit forgetable, but not the worst. I definetly recommend this anime to those who like action and mystery, aswell as a hint of psycological thinking. The music is also quite nice, as I love the opening and ending.\r\nSynopsis:\r\nThis story begins with beings called Ajin, they are eternal beings that simply revive after they die. Our protagonist, Kai Nagai, wants to become a doctor and help other people. This all goes wrong when herealises that he is actualy one of these Ajin. He runs from home, as there is a reward for capturing an Ajin, and he feared that people would turn him in. Along with his friend Kaito, they escape from town.\\n\r\nThe story only gets more complicated from then on, so If you're thinking about watching it, I say: \"Give it a shot\"... its a great anime, that definetly diserves a watch.",

            "content": "The first thing that you will notice about Ajin is that it\u2019s not aesthetically pleasing. It uses choppy 3DCGI similar to that of Knights of Sidonia albeit the latter meshed better with its cold futuristic alien-like setting. While here it blemishes the what could have been eerie atmosphere. Fortunately it wasn't enough to detract any meaningful enjoyment from this thrilling, monster-horror war, laminated with a logical cast of characters with easy to grasp motivations.\r\nWhile I say the art is bad, it's mostly just the awkward character designs and the janky animation. The direction is good but there is never a moment that leaves you feelingthat what you just watched was awesome. Which is sad because there are plenty of bad ass moments intermingled with gut churning creativity. The Ajin fights between one an other only remained interesting because it led into more insight about them, the fights themselves were about as entertaining as watching an infant mashing two plastic darkly clad figures together until one is randomly declared as the victor. This sentiment holds true to an extent with all of the fights. When a character died the impact of that death was diluted and it almost rendered a comical feeling. \\n\\n\r\nDeath is abundant and characters utilizing tactics based on immortality is rife and occasionally clever. You see characters killing themselves to escape, to keep awake and to kill others. I was surprised to see a Hannibal reference made by the antagonist but at the same time it was clever contextually as you didn't have to have read Red Dragon to understand that the antagonist was about to play a trick through the media to attract the attention of the otherwise unidentifiable Ajins.  \\n\\n\r\nThe focus follows a few different characters from three groups; the government/pharmaceutical company and the Ajins seeking domination and the outsiders. There is little nuance between the main characters except a shared trait of logic and reasoning. Each has differing motivations and when these motivations collide, the conflict between them sparks up in believable and intriguing ways. This is largely thanks to the protagonist who to simply put and as other characters describe him as, a jerk.\\n\\n\r\nTo go a bit deeper, he is the kind of person who is coldly logical, narcissistic and has questionable morals. All he wants to do is live a simple, comfortable life. When you pit him against the empathetic hero who wants to save lives at the risk of his own, or the mastermind leader who seeks revenge, or even just his childhood friend who wants to help him, it calls for interesting scenarios and all of which have engaging resolutions. \\n\\n\r\nThe mystery about what the Ajins are and what they mean is interesting enough, at least for you to what to know more but it's really what the characters do with that knowledge which differentiates itself from shows with a similar \"Oh no, I'm a monster!?\" premise like Tokyo Ghoul and Parasyte.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that I watched the English DUB of this and it wasn't terrible. OST is decent although I literally can't remember what it was like and I watched this yesterday so take that as you will. \\n\\n\r\nAjin is at it's best when ideals clash, supernatural powers are manipulated and character insights are revealed. While it fails from delivering any spooky chills, it achieves on taking you on a thrilling adventure through a field of death, deceit and disestablishment.    \\n",

            "content": "\"Humane? Ajin aren't humans so the word humane doesn't apply to them.\"\r\nThe theme of humanity is a recurring one in this anime, consequently bringing me back to my highschool English days as I watched movies like Blade Runner and Frankenstein. The show does an amazing job showing the monsters and humans in both human and Ajin parties - and the word \"monster\" is not as clear cut as once thought out to be. \r\nStory - 8\r\nDon't be fooled by the comparatively low score for the story - it is great, it's just that I haven't read the manga yet, and the second season is justaround the corner. This is a preliminary score - which although may not be fair as the whole story has yet to be told, I think is justified. Without giving too much details on the main plot, the story revolves around a bunch of characters, the Ajin (both good and bad) - mysterious beings who have been granted immortality, the ones who are trying to capture the Ajin (although their motives may be unclear) and although there is a supposed main character - he doesn't do all that much in this season. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nA lot of people are put off by the CGI, but in all honesty, it does not take away from the experience. In fact, if anything, it makes the monsters seem even more creepy with their unnatural, robot like movements. In terms of the actual art itself, it is amazing. DON'T let the art put you off watching this anime - unless you really can't stand it, it is up to personal preference after all.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nThe sound is spectacular. It meshes with the art style/CG perfectly, giving off eerie vibes at times, with intense suspenseful music to back it up. The opening song while not particularly memorable, fits well with the overall mood of the show. I've only watched/listened to the closing song once, because I'm too excited to watch the next episode for the next part of the story - and that's a good thing (although the closing song isn't very memorable either)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nThis is where this anime really shines. Characters are fleshed out in a subtle way - while ALL the characters still have many secrets to them, they tease and insinuate various reasons as to why a character behaves a certain way. The most interesting character to me has to be the primary antagonist, Satou - while he is a bit cliche, he pulls off his evil, manipulative ways in a way that even makes me think twice about his actions - that is until he goes mass murder mode.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nWhat can I say more than \"I really enjoyed it\"? Sure it wasn't the most amazing anime I've watched, but it's also the first anime in a while which I've actually bothered to watch from episode 1 to the final episode. It keeps you on your toes, and is a refreshing change to all those poorly made teenage high school comedy animes that are all too many.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nThere are a few times in this anime where I thought, \"what? how does that work?\", but the overall premise of the show is delivered well. Have I watched an anime like this before? Probably. Can it be a bit cliche at times? Yes. But is it unique? Yes - in an age where a good anime plot becomes increasingly more difficult to think of, and remakes are the norm, it pulls off an original concept without the stench of an overcomplicated and overthought storyline that too many animes these days try to accomplish.\\n",

            "content": "This series is insulting to the core. \r\nStarting with the art: the animation was clunky at times, and one could witness frame rate drops reminiscent of a laggy MMO. The blur filters & Dutch angles were overused to the point of making the whole thing extremely unpleasant. I do understand that it is meant to create an aura of persecution, which it also fails to do as the whole show has this \u201clazy\u201d feeling to it that I can\u2019t describe very well; and that doesn\u2019t prevent it from being generally uncomfortable to watch. The \u201cworking area\u201d of the world felt so small and constricted tothe point that it made it negatively impacted immersion. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was full of really bizarre choices (bizarre choices being a running theme in the show\u2019s production). The black ghosts\u2019 disintegration sounded like somebody slurping frozen lemonade with a Geiger counter. The music was practically nonexistent other than the \u201ctense\u201d drops during action scenes. \\n\\n\r\nIn an anime that at least attempts to be somewhat emotional and character driven (albeit poorly), ideally there would be a powerful soundtrack to back it up; to elevate the emotionality of a scene, give more impact & weight to settings and events and help immersion. The soundtrack entirely failed on all those fronts and was entirely immemorable. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty much non-existent. It was full of comically typical archetypes, most of whom didnt\u2019t feel like real people. Every single character either had no motivation whatsoever, or one that was hastily shoved in so the writers could move on.\\n\\n\r\n While extremely difficult to point out without going into spoilers; when you write any type of mystery or potentially fluid story, you generally should be throwing a few red herrings here and there to keep things at least not entirely predictable. Ajin has very little characterization and is full of contrived arks and twists that feel entirely forced in the sense that people seem to change and behave extremely uncharacteristically because the story needs them to. \\n\\n\r\nYou have people going from mass murdering terrorist into good guy vs vice versa without any kind of an arc or series of difficult choices that cause them to change in a significant way. A good example is the main protagonist whose name I can\u2019t even recall:  yet another whiny, sobby guy who turns from outcasted emotional high school boy into an obnoxious, annoying sociopath for no apparent reason. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the ham-fisted way Ajin justifies this is by creating memory segments and character accounts that convey \u201cno you see this guy was ALWAYS a piece of crap\u201d. Ajin lacks a single memorable character with any personality, relationships that felt meaningful or organic in any way.\\n\\n\r\nAnother bizarre choice made was the number of characters they decided to introduce. It\u2019s difficult enough to establish and properly build up a proper characterization and relationship for, say a duo of protagonists, in a 12-episode anime. Now triple that number of people.\\n\r\nThey attempted to establish relationships and story arcs that seemingly had the potential to go beyond where they did, but the show was so hasty to get to the next action scene that none of those ever developed, and any changes to them felt entirely blank and unimpactful.\\n\\n\r\nThis was mainly caused by the godawful pacing; where so much time is wasted on situations or characters that never ended up mattering, while characters and relationships that do deserve some slowing down to take a look at are entirely neglected.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the story, it is, as I mentioned earlier, insulting to the core. One of the most common methods in anime writing (see Parasyte) is taking an extremely silly premise or concept, yet exploring its implications and potential impact to such a degree that it builds up an extremely meaningful and heavily themed story that examines very difficult questions. What Ajin manages to do is precisely the opposite. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea of the existence of people who literally can not be killed could have so many interesting consequences. And while it did barely touch a few of those, they simply passed by and the writers didn\u2019t really make a point. The entire anime felt unsure on what it wanted to say. The attempt at a Tokyo Ghoul-esque \u201chumanity\u201d point was there, just like everything else in this anime it was incredibly shoehorned.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with all of this, Ajin gave you an arthouse nonsense of a non-ending, presumably because of the longer continuity of the manga; yet it\u2019s cute that they imagined another season of this mess would be produced. It probably won\u2019t.\\n",

            "content": "\"If I kill them, they come back to life\"- a perfect phrase to describe the concept. It'll be easier to understand if you've seen Baccano.\r\nDespite it's lack of popularity, Ajin is without a doubt an anime worth watching. Clothed in an interesting science fiction, it delivers a existing story that's quite hard to predict beforehand(except for the first past). So, if you like the psychological genre, I'll recommend it.\r\nWe often receive the concept of immortality and invisibility as set. But what if someone is neither invincible nor immortal, but instead is somewhere in between. That is the ability of an Ajin(Demi-Human). They grow old, justlike any human and age expire like all living things. But if killed, they come back to life.\\n\r\nIs that even an advantage? I don't think so, all they can do is experience death over and over again.\\n\r\nAfter the discovery of this new species of human, the obvious happens, they get targeted as lab-rats. And those who are caught get subjected to inhumane experiments. And those who escaped after being caught bent on revenge with the exception of Kei, the main character of the story.\\n\r\nIf this sounds familiar I assume you've watcher \"X-man days of future past\"\\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure myself, but I you keep reading, there may be a few spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nIf Ajins are just like human, why aren't they human? Are they discriminated base on a mere ability? Who would protect their rights?\\n\r\n\"However, if there is such a discrimination it's obvious that ajins are far superior to humans...Mohohahaaha...\"-That's exactly how Mr. Sato thinks. Who's he, you ask? He's the Ajin equivalent of Magneto. And so, to protect their rights, they unleash a rebellion against the government. Quite an effective one to say the least.\\n\r\nAnd he was like,\\n\r\n\"You built these weapons to destroy us. Why? Because you are afraid of our gifts. Because we are different. Humanity has always feared that which is different. Well, I'm here to tell you, to tell the world, you're right to fear us! We are the future! We are the ones who will inherit this earth! And anyone who stands in our way will suffer the same fate as these men you see before you! Today was meant to be a display of your power. Instead, I give you a glimpse of the devastation my race can unleash upon yours! Let this be a warning to the world.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Kei Nagai, a high school student who only recently discovered that he is an ajin. And following that discovery hell breaks loose for him. And his path would randomly collide with that of Mr. Sato's.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.6 The success of this anime is it's story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6.2 The art was quite different, and to be honest it didn't work for me. At first I was reluctant to start this series solely because of it's art, which reminded me of a few anime I regret watching to this day.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7.8 for most of the character, their way of thinking is rater realistic and not all that lovable. But it doesn't apply for magneto, I mean Sato, he's quite cool!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.0 From somewhere around the start all the way to the middle, I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.7",

No, don't throw re:zero, parasyte, code geass, psycho pass, or tokyo ghoul or whatever at me. This stands out alone like nothing you've seen before. The unpredictability, the charisma of the antagonist, the voice acting. I don't know what you childish weeaboos have against 3d animation, but i can't imagine a more fitting form of animation that could've portrayed the characters better. The facial expressions and body language are so much more consistently fluid and realistic,as opposed to one dimensional expressions from regular anime and truncated body movements where the most movement you get divided between inconsistently spurts of crazy action and panning across a still drawing to imitate movement.",

            "content": "Visually I found Ajin to be alright. I found it to be much more watchable then something like Kingdom or the second season of Berserk. The 3d graphics may not be for everyone but personally I think its better than the very basic art styles in some anime like Charlotte or Handa-kun (just remembering what I recently watched) which even with the basic art styles still end up being interesting enough. What is more important is the pacing and how an anime keeps your attention. \r\nHow Ajin keeps your attention is through it's constant action. In nearly every episode, especially in the second season, thereis always some sort of battle or physical conflict. Every episode is adrenaline pumping action. The drawback to this approach is that character development and sometimes story believability is compromised. Characters can seem very overpowered for no reason, and most only do actions that further action and conflict without considering different solutions. The show attempts to explore the psyche of the MC but they go in different directions and really trip over themselves in the attempt but try at the very end to somehow tie everything together. This is NOT a show for delving into the psychological or philosophical aspects of being an Ajin. Try to imagine Shiki but with less of the philosophical aspects and more of the rampant violence and this is basically what you'll get with this show.  In Shiki as well, you kind of get an idea of why vampires and non-vampires might hate each other or try to get rid of the other. In Ajin, it's never really made entirely clear why people accept the treatment the Ajin get. The show tries to explain it off in a sort of contradictory way that simultaneously the people know what happens to Ajin through like the dark web or a silent unspoken acknowledgment that they get experimented but at the same time the people won't do anything about it and if asked publicly they'll pretend that all that stuff is a rumor and that Ajin are actually \"protected\" by the government. Again, this stuff makes it easy to have an Ajin against the world type scenario and leads to some nice action and chase scenes but the explanation is not very realistic. Yes, it's possible that some people may not care what happens to Ajin but in the show it feels like EVERYONE does not give a care about the Ajin or are strangely ignorant to what happens even when it's obvious. One last point/fault with the story is that the lore of the Ajin is not sufficiently explored. The basics about the powers are explained, but by the end of the show, I didn't get any understanding of how became Ajin or anything of that sort, which was a bit disappointing as that was one of the things I wanted to know when starting the series.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up : action, action, action. It's filled to the brim with action and if you're looking for that type of show and don't want a standard shounen with laser beams and gomu gomu, this is it.",

            "content": "Dear readers,\r\nThis anime is highly recommendable by me, because this is an original anime, because it has a different animation. The story is original, which is that some people are Ajin (some sort of semi-humans) and they are being caught by the government to do experiments with, but some are fleeing from that fact and live a different life. And there also some Ajins who form some sort of army who pose as terrorists against the Japanese government.\r\nThe sound was great, because you had some creepy music whenever there are ghosts appearing or that the story had some tension. The characters were average though, butI wouldn't say they weren't original, because I saw some characters with personalities I had never ever seen before in any anime. So the art was original too, because you almost never see those sort of animations. You always have that standard animation, which you see in 9 out of the 10 animes you have ever watched and I like that this anime has whole different animation.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this was helpful, although it wasn't very long. Good byeeee!!!!",

Most of the show was pretty unengaging, and wasn't good for much more than something to have on in the background, but occasionally something really interesting would happen.  The 3d animation was kind of distracting, it looked fine for the most part but the way they did shadows looked pretty bad.  There weren't any characters I really liked but I don't think many of them were supposed to be likable.  Even considering that though, I still found many of the characters to be inconsistent in their actions and morals.  For example, themain character seems to be attached to another character for a few episodes, being inspired by that character and worried about the well-being of that character, but then in the rest of the season he's basically forgotten about.  The series is pretty heavy on chase scenes and action scenes which I don't get much enjoyment out of but that others might.  The actual strength and dangerousness of Ajin is inconsistent to the point were it broke my suspension of disbelief in some of these scenes.  They are made to be really dangerous from the beginning of the series but there are many instances were the military seems like it could have easily stopped them and just couldn't because plot armor.",

I'm just saying but most 3D CGI anime is really terrible, like dimension highschool, Mahou shoujo: naira girls, Kochinpa, and forest fairy five. *Vomits from eyes* anyways the 3D CGI in Ajin is (I know) not that appealing and it's kinda sluggish but it's better than Berserk and all of the anime I listed which Ithink have bad 3D CGI.

            "content": "So eh. Eh is the best way word that I can come up to describe this anime. But no means is it bad story-wise or character-wise or sound-wise, it's just that art. I did not understand the craze that happened with purely CG anime like you see in the later seasons of Berserk or almost all Netflix original anime. Something that you see to do a cheap and easy background of large scale should not be used for all characters let alone the main ones. It is a disgrace and it is painful and I do not like it.\r\nHowever, the art is about the onlybad thing about this anime. So if you are able to get passed the art like getting past bare boobs every scene in Highschool DxD to actually reveal good plot, then this anime won't be so bad. Let's start off with the story.....\\n\\n\r\nAjin comes across as having a plot that seems like you can't do much with it. Ajin are immortal and to the normal human , their worst nightmare as an opponent. Having an 'op' set of characters, especially a main character seems to be the most common form of anime for whatever reason. BUT DO NOT WORRY Ajin is not like that in the slightest.I would go so far as to even call this story original, you read that right, original. The story is dark and gripping and I feel that it portrays the characters how they should be portrayed. The story is not cliche and goes in places that you would not expect, constantly shifting to keep you interested. And the story is only as well done as it is thanks to the characters.....\\n\\n\r\nAjin presents us with a few sets of main characters and as you will find out watching, the character sets always come in groups of two, two main, two supporting main, two supporting, and two villains. Even when characters get introduced they usually come in sets of two. Though the anime does not have as many characters it focuses on as seen in shounen anime. What I find in the characters however is that they are all extremely hard to like. That was another drawback in me watching it though later on you learn to, not really like but understand the characters, I will be honest and say that it took awhile for me. The most likable character in this anime is the villain and if you watch Ajin you will probably feel the same even though he does some pretty messed up things.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I would rate Ajin as a time waster. Leave it running in the background while you play a game or something. That's about what this anime is worth in my opinion. It has a great story that it so easy to love and get behind but the art has about as much flavor as leftover ramen and the characters are extremely hard to like.",

This was honestly my favorite anime of Winter 2016, and yes, I did watch this real time, every week. The thing is, I haven't read the manga as of writing this review, so I'm not sure how closely it followed the manga's story, but I have to say, as a stand alone series, Ajin did a great job at bringing an already existing concept, but adding a new breath of freshness to it. The whole conceptof the \"Ajin\"s are done to make the audience pity them, but at the same time question which side you should cheer on for, the Ajins, or the police, which makes the story far more complex and well thought out.\\n\r\nOverall I have to say the story had plot twists and great moments, so I can't suggest it enough if you like Psychological thriller series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nNow I don't like CG in anime, and I think many people would agree with me on that. The thing is though, what I just stated there is only for 2D hand drawn animation that has 3D CGI in certain scenes, which makes it look very strange. With Ajin, it's completely different. The whole series is in CG meaning that nothing feels like it sticks out. Sure, the first episode was a bit clunky, but after it became smooth, it gained a sort of charm that I'd never seen in anime before. The \"artwork\" is done well in it's own unique way, and I wish more people would accept it for what it is. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe sound in Ajin had a few tracks that were so good, like the ones used in the Ajin battles or escape scenes. However, I felt like there were too many tracks that weren't very memorable at all, and that's why I gave this a 7. Apart from the OST though, the opening is superb. It is hands down one of the best openings I've heard recently, and is definitely worth the listen. As for the ending theme it was rather, dissapointing. It wasn't bad necessarily, but it wasn't very good either. And that's why Ajin gets a 7 in sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters are where it shines with Ajin. This series just has great characters who grow over the course of the 13 episodes, and you can really get to love one character or another. Some of my favorite examples are Nagai Kei as he grows and you can really see him getting smarter during each episode, as he deals with his own problems by himself near the end of the series. As for my favorites, Tosaki and Shimomura, they are both very well designed and have great moments throughout the series. All the characters' designs are solid, and the way they interact with each other is also something that we can appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThe enjoyment in this anime was crazy high as i just couldn't wait every week anticipating for the next exciting episode. Gladly, for anyone reading this review that hasn't seen this series,have fun because you can go ahead and marathon the whole thing. Oh, I also can't wait for season 2, coming out in October this year. (2016)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall Ajin gets an 8/10, for having a story that is common, but is done in away that makes it feel new, whilst having an eerie atmosphere and mysteries everywhere that makes watchers curious as to what will happen next. This series has some fantastic characters, and I'm sure you'll get something out of it if you're remotely into Psychological or Horror anime. \\n\\n\r\nCheck it out, you won't regret it.",

            "content": "I have a lot of respect for pieces of entertainment that can pull off realism in a way that interests me. As much as I live for the absurd, endlessly inventive, overly sentimental universe that anime usually inhabits, there is value in stories that bring their focus back down to earth, focusing on the subtleties and grit of the world as it is, not as we wish it to be. Still, if the past decade of half-baked Nolan Copycat Syndrome slogging through American cinemas has been proof of anything, is that realism is hard as shit to get right. Because it relies so heavily onthe immersion of making you feel like it\u2019s taking place right in our own world, it doesn\u2019t take much to break that suspension of disbelief. Logical issues, character acting, internal structure, and more all become absurdly important to get right. Real life is hard to capture in the context of a satisfying fictional narrative, and it\u2019s always blisteringly obvious when a story doesn\u2019t have the polish or focus to pull it off. Ajin is proof of that, if nothing else, a clockwork mechanism of a story that aims for the tactile, hardboiled feel of the likes of Law and Order, but doesn\u2019t have the chops to follow through on this promise.\\n\\n\r\nSet in modern-day Japan, the Ajin of the title are a new, rare species of human-like being starting to pop up in hidden among our society (think mutants from the X-Men). They seemingly can't die, making them objects of both desire and fear, forcing them to stay hidden less they be driven out of their homes and the government subject them to inhumane tests. Our protagonist, the emotionally detached high schooler Kei Nagai, is an Ajin himself, and when his status is discovered, he's forced to go on the run with his childhood friend and all-around stand up mate Kai, escaping government officials and reward-hungry bounty hunters alike as they search for a safe haven. Meanwhile, the Ajin situation as a whole is about to start falling apart as countless different factions start vying for power, including an anti-Ajin task force led by a couple of inspectors straight out of Psycho-Pass and an elderly Ajin with a desire to carve out a space in society for these new beings. Also, certain Ajin have the power to summon simulcrania of themselves in the form of mummy-like dark matter spirits, for the sake of initiating Jojo's Bizarre Adventure-style Stand battles between these ethereal energy monsters, because honestly, why not?\\n\\n\r\nSo perhaps it seems a little odd to call Ajin an attempt at realism. After all, this is a show where quasi-human immortals wielding black tar ghosts through spirit wifi is the central hook of the premise. Yet everything about the show\u2019s make-up, from the muted color palette to the dialogue\u2019s focus on technicalities over character writing to the subdued, pounding electronica of the score, speaks to a desire to ground these fantastical elements in the trappings of a grown-up police thriller, with big questions on politics, society, and psychology hanging in the background. This is a show that very much wants to be taken seriously, and that\u2019s not a bad thing. The problem is the story isn\u2019t well put together enough to support such a dour, bleak tone and subdued sensibilities. The logic of how events play out feels flawed on multiple occasions, like the writers knew what plot points they wanted to connect but weren\u2019t sure how to actually connect them in a reasonable way. Too many times a character will make a choice that confuses the heck out of me, Kei being the most frequent offender; I don\u2019t buy how sociopathically detached he ends up being, or how confusingly he bounces between emotional states with no adequate explanation as to why. In a way, it reminds me of Zankyou no Terror, how its attempts at hardboiled, serious-minded drama are undermined by its inability to grasp how these situations would realistically play out.\\n\\n\r\nAnd at least with Zankyou no Terror, the production was so staggeringly beautiful that it was possible to tune the story out and just let Yoko Kanno\u2019s score wash over you like waves on a rocky shore. Ajin can\u2019t even claim that saving grace, as it\u2019s marred by all the problems typical of an entirely CG production; stuttering framerates, a lack of momentum, an inability to break free from the styles and traditions of 2D animation and adapt to the new medium, and so on. It\u2019s a shame, because there are a lot of strengths to the show from an aesthetic angle. The action scenes all make use of the 3D space to decent effect, especially when the ropy goo monsters start smacking each other into ribbons. Heck, even the character animation can manage a decent approximation of realistic human body language and movement, in the rare moments where it gives itself more that 12 frames per second. And I appreciate how brutally committed the show is to the more out-there elements of its premise, how these immortal people can and will kill themselves to reset their bodies in moments of crisis, how intense and heavy the action scenes are, how it\u2019s able to get bloody and nasty without feeling like an overblown gore fest. At its best, when all these elements are working together, Ajin can be a really slick, propulsive experience. But those moments are too infrequent to make a sizable impact on the show\u2019s quality.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these issues, though, I am looking forward to the second season. Why? Because without spoiling anything, Ajin ends up with a really damn good ultimate villain, an engrossing sociopath who strikes just the right balance of madness and grounded realism. His big moment of triumph in was a hell of a thing to behold, and with the show promising to push his plans even further into the foreground moving forward, I can\u2019t help but remain hopeful that there are brighter days on the horizon. Until then, though, Ajin is a show with a lot of potential that remains buckled under the weight of its own inadequacies.",

Basically, the characters lack direction at first to the point you don't really know who is good and who is bad. I see this as a positive as it's very unpredictable. The ethics and way the government acts and reacts to pressures is very interesting and pushes the right buttons. I honestly, the animation was refreshing!!!! I have only seen a handful of animes (death note and titan inc.) but the movement and light are the best I haveseen in any anime... hands down! \\n\\n\r\nBasically, I have been compelled to write this as it's clearly badly undervalued in this community. The story has everything and if you like your animes on the darker side then you really should not be missing this one!!!\\n\\n",

The story is good and it kept me going. Its different but at the same time, you may have seen some of the details elsewhere. \r\nStory: 10/10 \r\nI went to bed at 3 am because I couldn't stop watching it. The first episode hooked me instantly and don't get me started on the 2nd one. \r\nArt: 6/10\r\nOk so the art is not that flashy or \"anime-like\". But that's what I like about this anime. Thecharacters are normal and it gives you a sense of familiarity. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nI love the opening. But to be honest, I didn't pay attention to it too much. It was ok anyways. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nOK so let's talk about the main character. Kei Nagai is a master of the poker face. I have never been so confused in deciphering his character. One time you think he is nice, the next one he is cold and regards others as unimportant. But I actually liked that, because it kept me guessing and I still don't know what he is REALLY thinking or what he is going to do next. \\n\r\nNext the old guy, Sato. After I saw Hei from Darker than Black I thought I was not going to get another badass and unexpected character but this guy surprised me. I thought he was another cold-blooded killer, but he was smart and witty so props right there. \\n\r\nThe rest of the characters were ok to me, except for Nakano, that guy was hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nLike I said, there are good animes out there but this one should be up there. I liked it since I never knew what was going to happen next. I usually lose interest in an anime when I know what is going to happen or the ending of it so of course I am going to love this. \\n\\n\r\nOveral :9/10\\n\r\nI have nothing else to say except that you should watch it and don't judge a book by its cover. I did and I almost didn't watch this amazing anime. And don't pay attention to the graphics, there are worse out there and people still like it. \\n\r\nSo happy binge watching!!!",

            "content": "This anime was surprisingly entertaining. The CGI was a bit clunky and took a bit to get used to, but I warmed up to it. Overall, this show is basically Tokyo Ghoul except better paced with more content in the same amount of episodes. Kei is basically a true neutral anti-hero who just wants to be left alone. This was annoying at first especially when he does something to his kind and helpful friend, Kaito and when he keeps running despite knowing of the threat of Sato.\r\nI hated Tosaka in this anime. He was a cold hearted ass who threatened to turn in his ajinapprentice numerous times and was generally cruel to her. Even though his backstory was revealed, it didn't do much for me and was generic and predictable. I guess my hate for Tosaka made me look past my mild dislike of Kei and get me to cheer him on despite his cold anti-social behavior. Kei's character was inconsistent on one hand due to his actions and words conflict at pivotal moments but could also be seen as an internal struggle. Sato was a really badass and cool villain and his appearances were really well done. I felt that that part was easily the best.\\n\r\nOverall, my main flaw would be that this felt like a prologue to the actual book which will be in season 2. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would give this a 6.5/10.",

They're great, you can really get attached to the supporting roles and the main bad guy is one hell of a badass.

            "content": "For years I had given up on Anime in General. \r\nThere were too many cliches and tropes, too many Loli girls and cutesy animations, too many half-hearted story lines; broken story lines; terrible story lines; no story lines to speak of. Episodic Anime took over, and Anime with even an hint of continuous, cinematic story telling fell by the wayside- at least in the mainstream. \r\nI grew up watching the great story-based anime. The epic, brave, forward thinking Anime that got most of the adult world into the medium in the first place- AKIRA, Ghost in The Shell, Perfect Blue. Those were the Anime oftrue merit because they created worlds that are, even by todays standards, totally immersive and perfectly realized. \\n\\n\r\nRecently, I got back into anime by finding series that have seriously well written story's, interesting,  dynamic characters, moral ambiguity and intellectual allure. \\n\\n\r\nParasyte: The Maxim was one of the first Anime in the last decade that I truly enjoyed, as it had everything one could hope for in a series: Great pacing, almost like an indie film, where random events didn't just pop up, and where you actually got to know the characters. There were rarely any cliches, no harem, no bubblegum pop distractions, and every episode was essential to the progression of the story. \\n\\n\r\nAjin is that kind of show. It is both highly original, while borrowing only the best aspects of horror- suspense, fear of death, moral ambiguity, and mystery. It's a story of survival, despite the odds, and finding out what it truly means to be human. Its an existential question mark, but it rarely gets lost in philosophy like Ghost in The shell. In the end, its simply one of the greatest suspense/horror anime ever envisioned.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the biggest issue people have with AJIN: The Animation.\\n\r\nHonestly, there is something about this style of CGI that I have grown truly fond of. I think its actually quite warm and realistic, even with its \"low frame rate\",  it really brings the characters to life with its physics and the emotional range possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason people complain about Ajin's animation is because they are constantly comparing it to other anime,  using other animators methods as some kind of standard.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with that is that Ajin was CLEARLY shooting for something original and fresh. The way Ajin is animated makes it feel like an actual film, and the emotions and physics displayed in the shows can't be on par with anything else out BECAUSE they are so different and unique.\\n\\n\r\n I feel that they are the perfect way to convey emotion and action in regards to the story, and once you let go of your preconceived notions of animation, you will be sucked right into the story, and you'll be clicking \"play\" on the next episode as soon as the previous cliffhanger ends. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the Directing and the story itself, this is one of the most cinematic and purposefully flowing anime series that I've ever seen, and it has like zero filler.\\n\\n\r\nIts pretty awesome seeing the medium of Anime elevated to this level of art; this level of story telling. Considering how many terrible, plot less series there have been in the past decade, I would think people would be more grateful for an Anime this substantial.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing here is also perfection compared to most series. It allows us time to worry for our protagonist, it allows us to question motifs and try and hypothesize what they might be, and it never assumes that we are so stupid that we need everything to be explained as its happening (that is something that turned me off from MANY anime, those cheesy \"dbz\" style monologes that explains EXACTLY why something is happening before we even have a chance to think about it.)\\n\\n\r\nIf you like your anime dark, mysterious, suspensful and intelligent, AJIN is for you. If you are the kind of person who absolutely hates experimental Animation, then you will probably not even get past the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nI urge you, however, to give AJIN the chance it deserves. The people who put this Anime together had their hearts in this 100%. This was by no means a cash grab, and I'm sure they knew going in that this would end up a cult classic, largely overlooked by the masses of Loli-loving fat 20-somethings who give anime a bad name. \\n\\n\r\nSo please, take off your Naruto headband, and if AJIN is to slow/inspired/intelligent for you, then go back and watch Attack On Titan, take in its story line and take in its glorious CGI parts, and use it to prepare yourself for something even more next level- AJIN: DEMI-HUMAN.",

Also the MC's voice actor is the same who voiced the MC from Death Note and both were beforehand living like an empty shell. \r\nArt-wise I personally can't say I like 3D animation like Knights of Sidonia and Ajin in particular. It's still underdeveloped and has room for improvement, you could say it's stiff and colouring (like shading) too smooth. Butyou soon will overlook the art due to the nice character development and story line.\\n\r\nYou start to pick up the interest for the story at the end of episode 1 so it doesn't really drags on about.\\n\r\nSounds are amazing and fits the scenes. Music keeps giving me goosebumps and chills.\\n\r\nIt's one of those animes you could keep on watching till you're done even if it means you have to pull an all-nighter.\\n\r\nVery captivating and thrilling.",

            "content": "What does it mean to live and be alive? Ajin may or may not answer that question but the story that focuses on life, death, and human-nature. \r\nPlot/Story 10/10:\r\nThe story revolves around Kei Nagai a student who discovers he is an immortal \"Ajin\". This discovery takes Kei a wild journey from going on the run, to hiding out in a small town, to eventually facing his problems. The episodes do very well to progress the plot, the pacing was well done, and each cliffhanger made me want to immediately watch the next episode. The overall story about the Human-Ajin relations is very well done andis somewhat reminiscent of human-robot/cyborg relations in some series.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Design 7/10:\\n\r\nThe animation was decent for CGI, though admittedly I am not a huge fan of CGI anime. It wasn\u2019t horrible though and I felt it actually worked well with the darker tone of the story itself. The character designs were a bit lackluster overall in my opinion, as none of the characters really stand out, that being said it wasn't bad as I have seen worse. The landscapes and backgrounds are gorgeous and I felt the art style did a great job of making the world feel alive.  \\n\\n\r\nAudio/Soundtrack 7/10:\\n\r\nI watched the English dubbed version; the voice acting was pretty spot on from what I can tell and I have no real complaints. Sato\u2019s voice actor did a great job of making him feel intimidating, while mostly being calm and cheerful. The soundtrack is nice but nothing revolutionary. I won\u2019t be listening to the OST on YouTube as I read the manga or anything, but I don\u2019t have anything bad to say about the OST either. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10:\\n\r\nThe protagonist Kei Nagai is not the most endearing protagonist in anime as he is kind of a \u201cjerk\u201d as his sister called him, but realistically he is just an emotionally detached, logical thinker. This leads him to come across as an anti-hero at times as he strives for self preservation. The antagonist Sato is a very deep and complex character, though not much about him is revealed in the anime at this point. He is military trained, tough, very smart, and calculating individual. Most other characters are pretty deep and well layered, as they all seem to have pretty compelling reasons for doing the things they do.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nI really didn\u2019t know what to expect going into this anime and was surprised at how it made me think about what the Ajin go through. I really enjoy anime like this that get to the heart of the dark side of human nature. For me Ajin was a very enjoyable, deep story that made me think about human nature and the human experience in general. While not the best the visuals and sound did a great job of creating a realistic and interesting world. The characters bring a depth and complexity of real world proportions to the anime realm. How do people act when they are faced with the unknown? I think this question represents one of the major themes of the series. I give 8.8/10 rounding up to an 9/10.\\n",

I don't regret watching it and it was not bad but with poor characters and slow paced storyline, this anime may be not for you and I'm going to go in more detail about that.\r\nStory-The story is pretty simple. You got these beings that are called ajins that looks like humans but can't stay dead, they are revived every time they die. The government are searching for ajins as well. The story is very slow paced, lots of dialog and verylittle action going on. That was a bit of a letdown because the episodes that had some action in it were great but so much was focus on the dialog that nothing interesting happened until the very end of the season. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - So I got to admit that Ajin has one of the best villain I've seen in any anime in a while. Mr.Sato was the only thing that was really good in this anime, everything else was OK or very shitty. It's weird because I don't think I seen an anime where I hate the protagonist but love the antagonist. Nagai was a big fucking asshole. He just didn't give a shit about anything or anyone, treated his friends like shit and just had an asshole actitue all the time. I really hate this guy and is by far the worst protagonist in an anime I've seen but Mr.Sato is freaking awesome, bad ass, very smart and funny character that enjoyed being the bad guy. This is how a villain is done.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Had fun at the last 4 episodes of the season but other then that it was a bit boring with all the talking. If you like an action packed anime well this is not for you but If you like some very boring dialog with poor character development and a shitty protagonist then my friend Akin is for you. I would recommend it just to see Mr.Sato in action.\\n\\n",

At first, the Main Character became an Ajin and I was like, I am so sorry for you, sweetie. \r\nThen I decided to take that back. \r\nSomething's just wrong with this show. The Main Character is just too non-ordinary with sadistic traits and literally ruin the whole show for me. \r\nEvery other character were like, the boy is unusual. To hell with it. I don't even get why his friend decided to help him escape. That boy should havejust die. He was trying to be a nice and wonderful person, but instead, he is rotten to the core. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, the first few episodes were enjoyable, but if you aren't looking for twisted personalities, I advise you to not continue any further than necessary.",

I believe he was a follower of the manga (though I have read some followers of the manga expressing disappointment). I started watching the same week it was released and at first found the animation awkward and stiff... but the plot was too interesting to stop for that reason.\r\nAs the episodes progress on you get more pulled in. I am looking forward to a second season. Its a show about this mysterious human-like being known as Ajin. They look like humans but they are almost impossible todie. Nagai Kei, the lead protagonist and an Ajin, is a character who stands out from the others. Sometimes his actions are puzzling and while in the beginning you sympathized with him, throughout the plot he seems to battle with how much he should get himself involved in the Ajin situation in his country. At times he seemed to become much like a villain himself. He was having a moral battle but by the conclusion of this season he had come a resolve that makes viewers look forward to what the next season has in store.",

            "content": "To preface, I am up-to-date on the manga.\r\nStory:\r\nEvent based, just like the chapters the anime covers within the manga. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of characterization, but with so many events taking place, it's very difficult for the story to dig into the ensemble cast.\r\nWith events at the forefront, holy cow are they good. While I had some issues with the pacing, at first (mostly errors due to the fact that producers need to hook their audience within the first episode, sacrificing a sense of stability), each event flows virtually seamlessly into the next. Not only that, the events that take place have a slowincrement of increased intensity that makes for a brilliant thriller that has a solid cool down for its final episode (which takes a relatively different route than the manga, which is understandable as a television program is different from a monthly released narrative. It needs a more dramatic, although resolved finale). In regards to changes from the manga, they're subtle, or don't affect the written progression already established.\\n\\n\r\nEvents aside, the characters are fairly flat in the first arc within Ajin. This works well with the events, as stated above, because characters follow a believable pattern that doesn't surprise. Again, this is great, because the events themselves can be quite surprising. However, this means those watching will not find any interesting character arcs, or dynamic growth with anyone within these 13 episodes. The following arc delves into a stronger self-awareness in character development, so I don't mind it as a whole, but I won't grade this work for what's to come, I will grade it for what it is by itself.\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress. Without characterization, we also miss out on the potential to teach a moral or lesson of any kind. It's unfortunately quite barren in these regards, but the events themselves overcome these issues so you, the viewer, don't find it all that bothersome.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n3DCG, but we're in an age where 3DCG isn't much of a bother anymore. It flows really well, micro-expressions are prevalent, and the action sequences look fantastic, but because this is a television program with a much smaller budget than a full-fledged film, there's some cheats and work-arounds that are quite visible.\\n\\n\r\nLet's get the negatives out of the way first, though. Conversation driven sequences are quite choppy, as if playing a video game at 16 frames per second. This is cheap, and kind of stupid. I don't know what's wrong with making it flow better. Either way, still dumb. The backdrops being water color painting looks great, and while it doesn't stand out so much, it looks quite barren. In fact, there are some scenes in which I thought to myself, \"There should be more people here...\" It's, again, due to lazy animation...\\n\\n\r\nPositives: Wow. Gotta mention it again. The fight sequences are excellent. Although people have issues with 3DCG, it looks pretty damn fantastic watching 3D models duke it out. It's in these scenes that I question which I like better: 2D or 3D fights? Perhaps if this anime did what the Berserk: Golden Age films did - animate dialogue in 2D and battles in 3D - then this anime would have had a better time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAbsolutely fantastic. This sets a standard. The combat sequences, or any scene in which an IBM is mobile, are humbling. As if the IBM's themselves weren't a little freaky, the anticipation of their audio presence is an added sense of dread. However, it's not so much their voices, but the sounds made as their bodies move, whipping around and demolishing their surroundings, people, or better yet, other IBM's.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the sound effects used for the IBM's, the gun sounds are really quite excellent, sounding fresh and realistic with proper effects used to amplify their surroundings. That, along with the other sound effects used in tandem make for an experience that I, quite honestly, want to participate again, but with headphones this time around.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also quite great, but there's a song or two that are used a little too much, which is my only gripe with the series in regards to the sounds. One of the better parts of the OST is that its main theme has variations to accommodate for the emotional weight of a scene. Seldom do scenes go beyond a thriller tone, but in some cases, one can hear a similar theme but played with softer instruments, or louder. This needs to happen more often with, like, all anime OST's.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nMentioned in the story section: vacant, but does its job. Each character stays pretty rooted in their established personality, and it's not until the following season/story arc that we'll experience their inner-workings on a more intimate level, as this part of the narrative is strictly event driven. Outside of this, there really aren't any issues, as the characters themselves are well-grounded in interesting and engaging environments, that also make for interesting and engaging reactions. Everyone, for the most part, is quite likable, from our protagonist, antagonist, and supporting characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nA rocky start, as I haven't watched a lot of 3DCG, but after I'd grown used to it, I ended up thoroughly enjoying each and every part of this anime. It's fun, suspenseful, and there were times where I was floored by how excellent it executed some scenes, despite the fact that I already had knowledge of them (due to reading the manga.)\\n\\n\\n\r\n((If you liked this review, friend me for new reviews on other works, both manga and anime!))",

            "content": "Warning: Some minor spoilers \r\nThe treatment of oppressed peoples and human cruelty is something that anime as a genre does not seem to take up very often, or at least is not done very well. The only anime I have seen that comes to mind as addressing this issue well are Fullmetal Alchemist with the Ishbalans, and, albeit more indirectly, Now and Then, Here and There. Though the plot to Ajin may look like a fairly standard dark anime plot at first, there is more than meets the eye here; Ajin deals with the topic of oppression in a more philosophical light, by asking thequestion what it means to be human.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I go into analyzing the plot too much (and my analysis may include some minor spoilers to some up to around episode 5), let me take care of some preliminaries about the art. Ajin is almost universally bashed for its 3D CGI-based animation that is rendered in a fairly low frame rate, dipping almost below 15 fps at some points. It is commonly remarked that this animation is completely ugly, feels unnatural, and falls into the \"uncanny valley\" of animation: looking just close enough to realistic, but far away from realistic. I completely agree, I almost universally hate this style of animation and low frame rates, even when done for \"cinematic\" effect, seriously bother me.\\n\\n\r\nBut at the same time, I would argue that the ugliness of the animation is among the best features of this anime. I thought there would never be a situation in which this style of animation would make sense, Ajin has proven me wrong. It is so radical that it has made me rethink what \"good animation\" actually is. It's a series about a type of people who are on the borderline of humanity and treated as if they are not human at all, and about humans who are betraying their humanity by being entirely cruel to others. It is only fitting, in the face of ugly actions and demi-humans, that the animation should be off-putting, close to truly realistic and familiar, yet so far away. The discomfort it causes truly matches the themes of the plot, it causes an anxiety and discomfort akin to the feeling of confronting the face of the Other for the first time. Sure, it's not pretty; but I appreciate it it for the same reasons that I appreciate atonal music,  it accurately portrays the relevant themes. Good art is not necessarily beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the plot. I find the MAL plot summary a bit lacking, so to give you a better idea, I'll stray outside of convention and give a slightly better synopsis, albeit with minor spoilers. A few years prior to the exposition of Ajin, a special type of people rumored to have supernatural powers and who cannot die were discovered, named Ajins. To the general public, Ajins are just a curiosity to be othered like any other obscure fact. This is how our main protagonist Kei Nagai felt about Ajins, until he discovers he is one. In Japan, any Ajins discovered are taken into government custody. The first few episodes center around Kei attempting to evade government custody, and the media who treat Ajins like a circus in typical sensationalist fashion, until other Ajins get him captured by the government in a bid to get him to detest humans. Then he discovered Ajins are used in brutally cruel, inhumane experiments in which they are tortured and killed over and over again for pharmaceutical and weapons research. Despite this, Kei refuses to kill humans and manages to escape to try to live out a peaceful life in a rural village. (This is where the theme of oppression I was mentioning earlier comes in.) \\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile, a group of other Ajins led by a man named Satou plan on using violent terrorist methods to try and get the government to stop the experiments. Good and evil get completely obscured as almost every character winds up having dark, and Kei, at first ruthlessly selfish and pragmatic, begins to discover his own human empathy. A number of great themes are touched on here, the nature of human cruelty, the ethics of revenge, and what it means to be human are all analyzed through a riveting plot that continually has you engaged with suspense.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, though, are where this anime could use a little bit of work. They are engaging enough, but occasionally their motivations and actions are obscured, inconsistent, and contradictory (especially when it comes to Kei, I can't explain exactly what I mean without presenting too many crushing spoilers), especially near the end. I have not read the manga so I do not know what happens next, but a number of these issues could be cleared up easily in the second season (if there is one, which there most likely will be). We'll have to see how the plot progresses to get a full view of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, also, has its issues. The voice acting in the sub is superb (though avoid the dub like the plague), but the music can be a little unrelated to the visuals. In general, the music is very well done, however there are several parts where the music will be playing an intense, fast pace, suspensful theme and all that is going on in the screen is some dialogue. At several points, it creates the feeling that the show is taking itself too seriously to the point of being campy.\\n\\n\r\nBut the directing style is absolutely where this anime shines more than anything else. A number of unique camera angles are taken on at several points. The shots can be awkward in the same manner that the animation is awkward, where the perspective will be obscured by a fence, or from the back of a room, or zoomed up intensely on someone's face, but they add to the viewing experience in the same way the animation does. The animation and directing style together create a sense of anxiety in the viewer that connects wonderfully with the anxiety of the story and themes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is a drawback to that avant-garde directing style and animation. Though intellectually I appreciate it, it does take down the enjoyment of the anime. It's enjoyable in the an aesthetic sense, but not enjoyable for the sake of entertainment. This is not to say it isn't entertaining at all, the off-putting atmosphere of the anime is made up for in the suspenseful nature of the plot, but I can easily see why many people wouldn't like Ajin, just like I can see why people like Naruto even though I don't think it's particularly good.\\n\\n\r\nDespite it's flaws, Ajin is perfect if you're willing to take on a thought provoking, if dark and uncomfortable, anime with a very original concept and suspenseful plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

But it would be nice if the creators at least tried to make the last episode some sort of ending with a \"to be continued\" cliffhanger or something.  Instead, the last episode is just like any other episode.  My other complaint is about the main character's inconsistency.  (Spoilers coming.)  In the beginning, he seems like he is a good person who tries to always do the right thing even if itwill hurt or kill him.  He tries to save people.  So it doesn't match at all when his sister says he's the worst and is cold and calculating.  But then in subsequent episodes, that description is proven true when he poisons someone and locks him in a truck.  He is like a completely different person from who he was in the beginning.  There is no reason for it.  If his character were consistently cold and calculating, then he would have joined Sato immediately, and ESPECIALLY after being tortured.  Who WOULDN'T hate people after being tortured like that?  Only someone who is pure good, how he was only in the first couple episodes.",

            "content": "Ajin taught me a life changing lesson, a lesson that I feel like everyone out there should learn from. CGI does NOT make a show bad.\r\nThere I said it, but I digress. Ajin was an incredibly intriguing series, with some of the best story elements this season. The world of Ajin, despite having some incredibly wild and interesting supernatural elements, still held an air of realism. Ajin is basically a setting where a specific supernatural theme is shoved into a world just like ours. There are many shows like that, with Tokyo Ghoul and its ghouls, and Parasyte with its alien things (yeah it's sci-fi,but you know what I mean), but the thing about Ajin is that humanity has actually tried to work around this supernatural phenomenon. Yeah, Tokyo Ghoul has them ghoul hunters, but do they study the ghouls at a scientific level as well as Ajin did? Nope. Thus, humans are no longer viewed as some sort of victim for this supernatural phenomenon. In fact, it's quite the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nBeing an Ajin must suck major balls, lets face it. Humans fear what they don't know, but in this world, they don't express fear by bowing down and surrendering. No, they ruthlessly hunt down, institutionalize, and experiment on Ajin all for the sake of scientific knowledge, so that humans can no longer fear Ajin. This twist on the usual supernatural meets humanity type of show led to a lot of very interesting story themes, and it also left a lot of potential for whenever the 2nd season rolls around.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- One of the best soundtracks of this season.\\n\r\n- Fairly well set up, yet still believable world.\\n\r\n- Great use of sound effects!\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- character models are animated in like 10 fps. This was a huge turn off for me ;-;\\n\r\n- Despite being unique, main character lacked relatability and emotional attachment. In fact, after the first half, he didn't even do much.\\n\r\n- Kaito was completely forgotten.\\n\r\n- I really wouldn't classify this show as a horror...\\n\r\n- Was purely a set up season, I expect actual plot once season 2 rolls around.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe reason why this set up season was still engaging is the attention to detail about the world of Ajin. The Ajin are supernatural, sure, but in this world, a lot of scientific research has been put into them. This really made the aspect of Ajin more interesting, since the world not only knows about them, but have also used science to execute methods of overpowering and subduing them.\\n\\n\r\nAjin has a very noticeable air of realism to it. People fear what they don't know and it really shows in this anime. For one thing, the first episode really highlighted what fear can do to human nature. The world always has a habit of turning against the unknown, and Ajin is a show that portrays that amazingly. It really asks you the question: Who are the real bad guys where? Who are the humane ones? Who are the monsters?\\n\\n\r\nAjin also uses mystery and suspense fairly well, as not everything is known about the Ajin. Scientific research is always shown to be still going on, and those tasked with dealing with the Ajin are shown to improvise new methods in order to deal with the Ajin. The ever constant development of Ajin knowledge, as well as the constant flow of new mysteries about the Ajin, leaves a lot of room and potential for the story to grow.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's it. This season set up the potential for a good story, but doesn't actually do something with it. There is a lot of people sitting and doing nothing, talking, and all the important things that do happen usually don't involve the main character directly. I felt like it was one giant prologue for a promised epic, yet it didn't quite make me care for the main character enough to actually get hyped.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nOmg, am I giving it a low score because of CGI? Well, that's half true...\\n\r\nWhat did the CGI do correctly? The action scenes, that's what. The IBM were incredibly fluid, the gunfire, explosions, and gore were very detailed, and you could really feel the impact of the action.\\n\r\nWhat did the CGI do incorrectly? The character models. I don't like them. Not because they look bad, but because they were animated badly. Why do they look like they are lagging? I swear, they were animated in less than 15 frames per second. It's not the fact that the animation of the character models were bad that triggered me, its the fact that they had the potential to make the animation so smooth, as proved by what they did correctly. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OST of this show was amazing. It really supported the suspenseful mood of the show. But really, what made the show stand out were the sound effects. All of the sound effects, from real sound effects, like the sounds of guns, explosions, and everyday occurrences, to the sound effects of supernatural themes, such as the groaning of the Ajin black material, all of it was spot on. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nNagai Kei isn't the same as your normal protagonist. He isn't some goody two shoes (or at least, he doesn't try to be), and he isn't some overly determined guy who is always trying to do the right thing. He's actually very selfish and prefers to live the easy life, and he's shown to be predominantly emotionless. While this makes him unique, I just didn't find him likable. Sure he does the right thing from time to time, but I can't help but feel like even his selfless acts have an air of selfishness behind them.\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, they are pretty bland or just aren't touched upon at all. For example, Kaito. What does he even do? Maybe he'll come back next season, but he really didn't do much of anything. The most interesting character of the show was Satou, who I think took more spotlight than even Nagai Kei. He was a really intriguing character who is shrouded in mystery. I really hope they dive into him more whenever the next season arrives.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAjin had a really steady level of enjoyment throughout, and that level being really enjoyable! Each episode left on a note that kept you wanting more, and the scientific findings about the Ajin were really interesting and fun to learn about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAgain, don't let the CGI turn you away! The substance, set up, and the great soundtrack definitely outweigh the shitty CGI character models.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Ajin's first season is essentially pure build up, with world building that feels far superior to a common comparison, that being Tokyo Ghoul. The world actually feels like what our world would be if Ajin were a thing, with the government prioritizing research and elimination of the Ajin, and the general public being actually well informed (to some degree) about the Ajin. I commend series for at least attempting to put forward a sort of scientific interest in the Ajin, even if what it comes up with are questionable. Despite this enthralling world, the lack of focus on the main character is a huge shame. There was only one truly interesting and engaging character in the show, while the other characters either feel like plot devices or straight up don't matter. In other words, the first season of Ajin had so much potential to properly set up the world AND the story, but hey, at least it did something right.",

            "content": "DaikiClub Bro Time-Saver Review:\r\nBLUF: Ajin is extra medium. As a stand alone season, it's disappointing, but I will probably watch next season. 7/10\r\nStory-  An issue with me is that the story pacing is terrible. It goes from 0-100 real quick and stays there. It looked like it was going to be slow but then it became almost pure action. I just watched Baccano about a month ago so the idea isn't that unique to me either. Overall the plot had just enough to make me watch the next episode. It also leads pretty well into another season, but it's still frustrating how nothing isresolved in the first season. 7\\n\\n\r\nArt- The 3D is an enigma to me. On one hand I hated it at first, but it grew on me. It also opened a lot of doors aesthetically. I thought it looks pretty good in the long run, but nothing great or special. 6\\n\\n\r\nSound- The OP was great! I thought it was jammin' and the rest of the sound was great too. The voice acting was fine. I don't have anything wrong with the sound. 8\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- The characters in this show are just gray. There's nothing exciting or unique about any of them other than Hat and the MC. Those two showed a lot of maturation and change though. I think Hat's emotional and mental shift was well done. I also liked how the MC had an obvious personality shift as the show went on. In 13 episodes I wish they would've developed a single supporting character, but they didn't. 6\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- This was a new experience for me. This is the first anime I've ever watched 1 week at a time and my first 3D anime. I'm not a big fan of cliffhangers and I wish they would have wrapped up the story a bit, but I'm guessing it'll get re-uped for another season. I'll probably watch it again next season. I thought it was exciting and fun to watch despite it's problems. 7 \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Watch it if you want something a little different visually. Don't kick down the door to watch it, but it's ok if you're out of ideas.\\n",

Death scenes at an anime is always saddening but Ajin has an exceptionally good storyline I have to agree but the way they put it in the anime is just pathetic. Compared to the manga they have made some unnecessary changes that has made the whole anime pathetic. \r\nEven the haters have to agree that the graphics are really good and the characters have potential but for some reason they are just ruined.\r\nBut there is a thing that I personally like about this anime is that,even though it is not completed I think they are giving a massage to the viewers that life is actually precious even if think you have enough time, it is not enough. Even if you can live over and over again all the time in the world is not enough to spend.\\n\r\nAnother thing that it teaches is that the love of humanity. Are you ready to go against your own kind to save humanity if you find out you are not  a human ? Or will you just cooperate with them and make place for your own kind. You'll see this type of situation in the anime. But if you ask me , my opinion is that you should watch this if you think you fucked up in your life. There is nothing to save you. This anime will prove you wrong.",

            "content": "I've watched this anime a while ago, and I can tell that I strongly enjoyed the experience. First 4 episodes are nearing masterpiece quality - I watched them in one sitting, captivated by the story and action. Anime became a bit weaker past 4th episodes, but was still enjoyable nevertheless.\r\nDetailed breakdown is below.\r\nFirst thing is graphics/visuals. It is another of the new fully 3d anime titles, similar to \"Sidonia no Kishi\". I must say that I've become fond of this style.... One of the common complaints about this visual style is low framerate, but it is important to understand here, that this style exists tomimic hand-drawn anime, and hand-drawn anime is shot at low framerate - occasionally at 12 fps (\"animated in twos\"), with action scenes upping framerate higher (\"animated in ones\"). The moment you up the framerate it'll no longer look like anime. Basically, it is not a pixar movie and it shouldn't try to be one.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual style shares a lot of similarities to visual style of \"Sidonia no Kishi\". As with \"Sionia no Kishi\", it is not a perfect emulation of hand-drawn anime (meaning nowhere close to the level of, Guilty Gear Xrd Sign), but more resembling PS2 games by atlus, for example, Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne. Character design is okay, with one female character having right amount of cuteness, characters are diverse and do not look like clones of each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has absolutely amazing main musical theme (which has organ mixed with modern instruments) associated with \"Ajin\", which you'll hear often. The music is probably the strongest part of the show, since it perfectly complements its atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nI saw people comparing this to tokyo ghoul, I gotta say that there's very little in common between those two. Tokyo ghoul featured a lot of hysterical characters, yelling about morality, humanity, and the like (which is why I ultimately dropped it). Ajin is more \"indifferent\" towards morality and concentrates on characters more. So it is not about being human or being a monster and more about characters trying to achieve their goals.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would recommend to watch this. It is not the anime to watch for drop-dead gorgeous visuals (although it looks alright) or comedy, but the story is good, and action is great. \\n\\n\r\nSo, if you have the opportunity, check it out.\\n\\n",

That\u2019s the whole gist of what this anime is.\r\nAjin: Demi-Human is an anime based on manga with the same name: Ajin. Now, I never read manga, so I have no idea how this show is different from the manga. But that\u2019s not something that prohibits me from talking about this anime. After all, an anime needs to stand on his own without the need to first read the manga. Nobody wants to read through pages andpages of text to understand why things are happening in a show. \\n\\n\r\nBut back to the anime. Remember how I said it\u2019s like the ugly girl on school? That\u2019s because the animation is made with 3D animation and it\u2019s clear that the makers of this show don\u2019t know how to really use it well. The animation feels slow and not as fluently as it is normally the standard in anime. It took me a few episodes to get used to the way people move in this world and there are times that you are thinking: \u2018\u2019Man, this look ugly.\u2019\u2019 However, you get used to the animation pretty fast.\\n\\n\r\nAnd besides, if shows like South Park has taught us anything, it\u2019s that bad animation isn\u2019t the thing that makes or breaks a show. The story and characters is what makes a show stand out in the first place and boy oh boy does this anime have a great story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about the main character who finds out he is an Ajin: a monster/human who doesn\u2019t die. Every time an Ajin is killed, he revives a few seconds later. But of course, the government is after these people and conduct horrible experiments on them since they cannot die. So our main character decides to run away and hide for the government.\\n\\n\r\nBut while this is all happening, another Ajin called Satou is working on attacking the government for what they have been doing to his kind. \\n\\n\r\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: \u2018\u2019Isn\u2019t this kinda like ghouls from Tokyo Ghoul?\u2019\u2019 Yes, yes it is.\\n\r\n\u2026\\n\r\nWhat? I didn\u2019t say it was an original story. However, they do seem to do a lot more in this show then in Tokyo Ghoul on the story. While Tokyo Ghoul had a story that made no sense and often had enormous holes in them, this story sticks with the lore it sets up in the first few episodes and rolls with that. \\n\\n\r\nAll characters are pretty one dimensional. The horrible government, badass evil guy and so forth. However, this isn\u2019t as noticeable when watching the show as you would think. \\n\\n\r\nAnd let\u2019s talk about that soundtrack\u2026 oh god. The intro got me amazed every time I heard that awesome music. And besides that, the music that\u2019s used in the show itself is awesome as well.\\n\\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, it\u2019s a pretty good watch. If you can wrestle trough the bad animation and get to the soul of this anime, you see what it has a lot to offer and that this anime is way better than the average show.\\n",

            "content": "(First time writing a review. I'll try to keep it as short as I can and without waffle. You may not agree with all of it but this is my personal view of Ajin Season 1).\r\n[Art-Rated 9]: The art style helps to set this anime apart from others. Although at first it may seem \"ugly\" you get used to it after about the second episode. Rather than using bright, bold colours (like a lot of animes use) they've used slightly duller and more realistic colours. I think this helps to draw the viewer in and help it to seem more life-like, as well as settingthe tone to the story line. Despite the art style not being my personal taste I rated it so high because of the individuality, they could have easily gone more a more eye appealing approach however I don't think this would have been fitting. It's meant to be \"ugly\" as it fits the \"ugly\" story (not saying the story is bad, I mean that as in a lot of deaths). What mainly makes the art style so unusual, at first, is the amount of shadows given to the faces which have given it more of a 3D effect rather than the normal 2D that we often see. To sum the art style up it\u2019s your normal, detailed looking anime with a hint of modern day, life-like game art.\\n\r\n[Sound- Rated 8]: From just watching Ajin once I noticed that they gave attention to detail in terms of sound. Where the sound effects could easily be ignored they have added both noticeable and subtle effects. There are times when I felt as if the sound effects for things were a bit too loud and made them seem out of place. By adding just the right about of subtle effects they help to bring the story to life, for instance there\u2019s small sound details like footsteps, doors opening, the burning of a cigarette and the movement of items such as glasses. Personally I quite liked the ending and opening theme songs. The first is quite upbeat and energetic whereas the ending is slower and has a sad tone even when the backing music becomes more upbeat. The overall all sound to the last song is quite beautiful and seems fitting to credit\u2019s animation. The opening song and animation has your stereotypical crime mystery/action style giving you a sense of excitement.\\n\r\n[Character- Rated 7. Story- Rated 9]: You don\u2019t feel much sympathy for the main character or any characters at all, in fact the character I did feel for (for being selfless) you didn\u2019t see after a few episodes. As I haven\u2019t been following the manga (which I assume is further ahead) I\u2019m not sure whether many of the characters you see in the beginning even return later in the story which gives a missing/off feel to the anime. The lack of sympathy felt is due to the lack of character background, we\u2019re shown a bit but not enough to build any attachments. Another reason is that we\u2019re made aware of the selfishness and lack of caring all the main characters have. Despite this being a negative thing for character development I see this as being a positive for the story as it creates a moral without being too outright, allowing you to notice it yourself.  There is a strong theme of \u201cif it doesn\u2019t affect me why should I bother?\u201d which is something most people can unconsciously relate to when we see something happening to others, whether that\u2019s a stranger in your street or multiple people in another country. I may have missed it but as far as I saw there was no reason for the Ajin to be attacked nor were the society given one, leaving you to question how moral everyone is/was. The society wasn\u2019t bothered as long as they were given a reward of money for their help. This again picked at the idea of people being greedy, selfish and ignorant, allowing you to reflect on yourself. Money, personal survival and aiming to gain something out of your actions were quite strong themes throughout. I had originally rated the story 7 or 8 but I think the use of these messages (whether they were intentional or not) brought it up. \\n\r\n[Enjoyment- Rated 8. Overall- Rated 9]: There were three clear sides/teams of the story with times where I felt siding with one team over another; however I always biasedly favoured the side of the main character for varied reasons. Each time one side looked like they were gaining an advantage they were \u2018brought down a step\u2019 creating suspense and with little idea what will happen in the next episode or even next season. This helped draw the audience in, ignoring the un-favoured art style as mentioned before. The amount of action in each episode thickened as the story progressed and made it clear that the story would either have an abrupt end or would have a second season. Luckily the ending of episode 13 made it clear that it was the latter option, otherwise it would have made a disappointing ending to an otherwise good story. The reason I gave it an overall 9 was for the story, art style and the background messages that can be seen. The uniqueness of art style and somewhat risk they took with it gave the story its own feel/aesthetic. I think those who can \u201cpersevere\u201d with the style and get past the initial dislike will not be too disappointed with this anime. \\n",

They are chased down by the government, who consider them as a threat to humanity and wants to experiment new weapons on them. Fairly simple right.\r\nIt has a fine soundtrack. There are some ost that are used many times in this series but doesn't get repetitive. \r\nThe use of CG is actually not bad at all. It will need some getting used too, at first it might look bad, there are scenes were you feel it's kind of lagging like in a videogame were some particular frames look laggish but you'll get used to it and start enjoying it. It's art is really nice.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing, Nagai kei the main protagonist is totally awesome. He has this mixed personality some times he is really cold and sometimes he is really nice. Nagai Kei tries to get rid of useless emotions  like sorrow,happiness. Satou the main villian is at first a kind man but soon you see his dark side. There are many other characters with cool personalities. The cast was great.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the show, the awesome moments of thriller, a fine soundtrack, nice CG animation, and an awesome protagonist.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give Ajin a immortal score of 8/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "Despite all its shortcomings, Ajin: Demi-Human is a decent addition to the supernatural/mystery genre that may be worth your time.\r\nThis is not an anime for the fainthearted as the level of violence is taken to extreme lengths. Without giving away potential spoilers, repetitive killing and torturing children are heavy components of the story. Whilst Ajin employs a lot of elements of suspense and horror, it is not a downright scary show. Rather, what is presented to the viewer is a mysterious premise, with a number of clues along the way. One can either put the clues together or simply just await the shows conclusion fora better understanding of the supernatural elements.\\n\\n\r\nAjin introduces an array of characters that may pique your interest. Admittedly some of the character archetypes feel recycled, and character development could also be considered a weak point of the show. Nevertheless, honestly just one character is mysterious and peculiar enough alone to warrant your attention \u2013 you would know who I\u2019m referring to if you\u2019ve already watched the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe 3D rendering is also a big talking point of Ajin. Suffice to say, the action scenes are amazing. But this reviewer still found it difficult to watch; movements outside combat appear jerky and stiff. Perhaps with a better budget Polygon Pictures can look to improve their overall CG animation for season 2. One can hope.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it\u2019s worth, here\u2019s a summary;\\n\r\n+ Supernatural elements are mystifying and interesting enough \\n\r\n+ Action scenes are mostly well-done\\n\r\n+ Excellent start and a well thought-out ending  \\n\r\n- Dip in the middle of the show will give you the shits\\n\r\n- 3D animation is polarising\\n\r\n- Character development is overall weak\\n\\n\r\nFor better adaptations of horror/supernatural works, you may wish to see Tokyo Ghoul or Parasyte the Maxim \u2013 the latter is often highlighted as the masterpiece of this genre.",

            "content": "I must admit, I was supremely skeptical when I first decided to watch Ajin. It was a name that had registered vaguely in the recesses of my mind when I encountered it on Netflix but had immediately dismissed it with an arrogant \"Anime on Netflix... gimme a break\". \r\nI decided to watch it after a encountering it on one of the MAL lists and my curiosity was piqued and I wasn't disappointed. \r\nRight off the bat, I'll admit that the animation is annoying. The production value changes dramatically through each episode with frame speeds varying through the series, which can make things a little annoying.While battle scenes are visually cleaner and interesting, the more ambient moments of the anime are visually poor. There's simply no mincing words on that.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, it is pretty interesting and like some of its predecessors (Gantz comes to mind) delves into the darker parts of humanity's psyche (animus for the freudians). Feelings of apathy, anger, alienation and avarice feature heavily but sometimes can feel a little hollow when the story fails to draw on how these feelings came about or why these characteristics germinated within the characters. Had the anime been longer, perhaps more of the characters could have been fleshed out and possess more detailed back-stories. The lack of significant flash-backs means that some characters sometimes feel like cardboard cut-outs: simply displaying the same emotion with seemingly no basis whatsoever. Though causes & motivations are mentioned per se, the allusions are loose and much if left to your extrapolation or imagination. I haven't read the manga yet so I am unsure if the adaptation is simply faithful to the manga or just butchered so it could be crammed into 13 episodes. \\n\r\nThe other salient complaint I have is that the gore is very mediocre and is mostly \"macro\" gore (i.e limbs being blown off in a spray of blood) but has little or no micro level details such as the details of limb regeneration or bullets being ejected by a body. This makes the 'Ajin' nature more confusing and the action slightly less fulfilling than it could have been. But I can admit that I'm being nit-picky now. \\n\\n\r\nThe BGM and score is reasonable with a few highs but doesn't really enthrall or complement the visuals. It simply is. \\n\\n\r\nThere are only two salient characters in the show: the protagonist Kei and chief antagonist, chaos creator and frankly the best character: Satou. Kei is a cold, rational and vaguely psychotic high school kid. Although this makes for pressing viewing but his character vacillates through the series, with no apparent rhyme or reason. The show fails to address what motivates/drives him or why his nature is as such even though he seems to have had a relatively normal childhood. The cause is a briefly mentioned but is frankly too little and too late.\\n\r\nSatou on the other hand is one of the TERRIFYING villains I have seen in an anime and the saving grace that uplifts the entire show. His twisted ideologies are masked in calm, confident & friendly veneer; one that sends shivers down your spine when it cracks. Though, his motivations are vague at best and the show only alludes to his past experiences, the manifestations of his psychotic desires propel the story forward brilliantly. Guerrilla warfare, terror tactics and ruthless disregard to human life are just some of the words I could use to describe all his operations. Revealing any more would only spoil the story. Simply put Satou is the linchpin that serves to hold Ajin up. \\n\\n\r\nThe remaining characters are a simplistic bunch of stick figures who simply serve to prop up the salient hero and villain. They don't develop too much through the show, which is a significant flaw and is really what stops the anime from being 'great'.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is entertaining and worth a watch. Go in with low expectations and you'll enjoy the ride thoroughly.\\n\\n\r\nHappy viewing!!",

            "content": "Ajin is a good choice for you if you're pretty interested in the possible moral dilemma's behind immortality, as long as you don't mind and can tolerate anime CGI.\r\nBecause the thing that turns off people most from it's the fact that it's CGI. And I think I can see why. I don't know if it's a common problem in CGI'd anime, but in Ajin, the normal scenes, basically where there isn't any action and there's just the characters casually moving around and whatever the animation looks like it moves like 3 frames a minute, to quote a friend, which kills any chance for the animationto look fluid in any of those scenarios. However the animation does have some moments where it does pick up, specifically action bits, because there's movement and the frames aren't mandatory. The only two excuses I can find for the animation being framefucked are these: A) The lightning effects and shadows take a toll on-engine which may lag it. B) The transition to the \"ideal\" frame rate doesn't translate well. In engine the frame rate probably was far higher but due to the fact the frame rate used in anime on average is 24 frames per second, they lowered it to fit that quota. \\n\\n\r\nBecause the CGI choice makes sense for Ajin. I wasn't sold on why it would be a good idea but the way the IBM's are animated looks pretty good and the world does look quite well. What I'm trying to get at that the CGI doesn't look bad because the animators couldn't do a good job. As an example of good animation in the series I'd say you could look at the ending of the series which actually looks quite well as an example. (Which is also not CGI) \\n\\n\r\nI'm basically trying to say that the complaints aren't necesarily only due to style of animation but also the animation doesn't look bad because there wasn't any effort put into it. \\n\\n\r\nBut all of this is no excuse for the series looking bad if the series does look bad for you. As I've said, it looks like it moves on 3 frames a minute and nothing does really change that. You get used to it after a while.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I wanna talk about is the adaptation of the source material being followed with a couple of logic gaps in the series. I'll use some early episodes minor spoilers which shouldn't ruin the experience for you but it does tell you how the course of actions envelop so you might want to avoid this if you don't know the plot of the first episode, although I will try to not give it completely away. I'm saying this primarily for those that read the manga and are interested in the adaptation. So okay, there's these two characters that escape on a motorcycle and head out somewhere and one of them is chased by the police and known in the entire country by face. In the manga, the fugitive wears a cyclist helmet, while the driver wears none. Also the fugitive has some clean clothes on. In the anime? The fugitive has his clothes bloody and torn and while the fugitive does wear that cyclist helmet I have mentioned, guess what the owner of the bike does wear? A motorbike helmet. If you haven't seen a motorbike helmet ever it covers your entire head entirely, there's no chance anyone would recognize you by face. In the manga it looks like two teenagers running away, scared and having no idea what to do. In the anime it looks like two goddamn morons having no idea what they're doing and can't use a little bit of logic. Which is rather important since one of the character's personality is supposed to be that he's a logical thinker detached of other people. And in the first few episodes he looks like a complete idiot.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, there's many more logic gaps in the series, which either weren't as apparent in the manga or at all there. As an example that is non-spoilery, I'll just give you a minor but broad example. Say you're immortal and your clothes are bloody and torn. Toss them away, don't continue wearing them while you'd easily arouse suspicion. There are also some minor changes from the source material made but they're mostly made to fit the narrative and it's generally pretty faithful and most changes are for the story to make sense or to fit animation. Still most changes in the series, be they cosmetic or for the sake of the story, can be traced to some sort of problem more often than not.\\n\\n\r\nWhich makes it the story far harder to take in without rolling your eyes at certain points.\\n\\n\r\nThe story's central theme is morality which I have to say it does do a good job on that, (considering the source material) the series providing a cause for the seemingly amoral or poor behavior of someone and their take on it while trying to show their side. Although I have to say most characters don't have a lot of depth and their personality is generally really limited their actions are usually explained by their background and motivation and the series deals a lot with \"does the goal excuse the means\". They have a purpose and they're representated in that scope. It's often done ok, but given that I don't really remember the source material well enough to make a comparison of which one does a better job on this, I don't know if the character representation has more depth in the manga. But the series does still regardless do a good job with displaying morality.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the only things I also have to mention about the series that it does have a solid OST, with a very good selection of themes to set a very good and fitting tone for the series and that the fighting scenes do look good. I'm glad to have seen a variant on screen and the fights do hold up despite the atrocious frame rate chosen for this series, as well as the tactical nature of them still being represented quite well, despite what I have had said about logic gaps previously. I also have watched the english dub over the japanese one because I wanted to make the argument in case it's not as bad as rumored that if you're interested in the premise and you think of CGI as the bane of anime, if the series was done as well as I'd hoped I could've suggested you to watch it dubbed and try not to think of it as an anime to try and avoid some prejudice, but that didn't happen, but I'll the dub some credit that it was better than the average anime dub and the voice actors did sound somewhat decently, even if the character voices were somewhat similar to one another.\\n\\n\r\nYou probably won't enjoy this series if you really hate CGI, you do get used to it at one point but the frame rate still will probably bother you & if you don't enjoy the occasional logic gaps, in the source material they're not there or not as noticeable. (or justified) The only thing I can say is try to not judge the source material based on the direction its taken and try giving it a chance if the theme of it does interest you, but keep in mind that the odds of tackling these problems lower by a lot if you choose reading the manga instead. Overall, I managed to enjoy Ajin, despite thinking it's a poor adaptation, but there's very little people I can actually recommend it on its own, let alone over the source material.",

            "content": "Ah, Ajin. Such a divisive anime of the 2016 batch. I admit that the visuals are....sufferable at best, and that the story/characterization is muddled at times. However, it can succeed in the latter two aspects, along with having some decent soundwork.\r\n[Story - 5]\r\nThere are really two stories at play in the first season, despite one whole narrative being advertised - one is a teenage boy running away after being exposed for a secret he didn't know about himself. The other follows the struggle of Ajins (immortal humans) and the inevitable law enforcement tasked to capture them for research.\r\nWhile I enjoy these concepts alone and wasintrigued to see how they would be interwoven, I'm left a bit disappointed with the execution. I honestly found it really lacking in finesse, with sudden jumps from one story to the other, and very few firm connections established between the two. I'm glad there is a second season to follow up on these connections, but I'm otherwise not impressed.\\n\\n\r\n[Art - 4]\\n\\n\r\nProbably the most universally-loathed aspect of the anime. I'm not necessarily against CGI entirely, as it can be used skillfully. However, this is not the case for this show - the characters' renders look rather incomplete and most of the action is not done in a 'fluid' manner. While I admit that there are successful aspects (character design, Ajin rendering + action, backgrounds/scenery), we are ultimately left with a rather weird-looking anime.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound - 7]\\n\\n\r\nThis was probably my favourite aspect LOL. I admit the OP is edgy, but I do believe it suits the show well for creating a tense and dramatic atmosphere. The ED is appropriately less intense and more sorrowful (with surprisingly well-done visuals). The OST isn't uber unique, but it does serve the purpose of creating an atmosphere of dread and desperation.\\n\\n\r\nThe SFX aren't /amazing/ in my honest opinion, but I mostly blame that on the editing of these SFX to the awkward animation. If it was for a more smoothly-drawn show, I would be more lenient.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is really hit-or-miss for me. Kei, the teenage protagonist, sounds a bit too old for his age, but he conveys the personality perfectly. Sato's seiyuu is deliciously manipulative and confident, and Tosaki has the cold, dedicated demeanour that oozes from the very first scene he is in.\\n\\n\r\n[Character - 6]\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization in this show is....intriguing. There are certain stand-outs, of course, but everyone else just seems to be Potential Unrealized. \\n\\n\r\nKei is an example of the former. He may seem like another Whiny High Schooler who should know better, but quickly reveals himself to be rather cold and calculating (which begs a rather relevant question brought up in the show). It's truly interesting to see just how far he will go to preserve himself, and what type of roadblocks can actually stop him. Sato is another example, but less powerful - while (at the moment) he's just another Extremely Maniacal But Intelligent antagonist hellbent on world domination/destruction, it's undeniably fun to see just what will he do and how it will be done.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there's the other side of the coin - Take Tosaki and Izumi for example. Perhaps this is because of the source material dictating which details are revealed when, but they just.....don't quite cut it for me. I do enjoy their scenes and I'm invested in the show partially to see how they become more fleshed out, but it's understandable why they may not appeal to most at first. They have rather bare-bones personalities, with few but intriguing hints to their pasts. It's a shame more details about their motives and pasts weren't revealed in this season, but hopefully the second season will deliver.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment/Overall - 6]\\n\\n\r\nThis wasn't as terrible as people said it was, honestly. The artwork /does/ suck, amongst other flaws, but I see why other people like this show (whether or not they read the manga). I would recommend this if you're not too critical of artwork, and just want to see some interesting characters with good plot hooks.",

            "content": "Ajin is a 13-episode anime revolving around Kei Nagai, an average high schooler who keeps to himself. Ajin are immortal beings that cannot die and after being hit by a truck Kei realizes he himself is an Ajin. Keen to escape the tortures that await him Kei is forced to fight both human and Ajin foes in order to find acceptance amongst humans to live a normal life. \r\nOk. Now for those of you who cringe at the sight of 3D animation may be thinking \u201cNo way in hell I\u2019m watching this!\u201d Now I can empathise as I\u2019m not the biggest fan of 3D animationeither, but I will try my upmost to convince you to give it a try. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nKei Nagai isn\u2019t the most social guy in the world and his relationships with his family members are often strained to a degree. Kei is distant from his classmates and has shunned his best friend for unknown reasons. Suffice to say, Kei is quite the loner. Kei is aware of Ajin\u2019s and the rumours surrounding the experiments conducted upon Ajin\u2019s. \\n\\n\r\nOn the way home from school Kei is hit by a truck and to his and many other bystander\u2019s surprise he turns out to be one of only three Ajin\u2019s within Japan. Determined not to meet the same fate as other Ajin, Kei escapes the suburbs with the help of his old friend Kaito. Thus begins the story of Kei\u2019s struggles to find peace in a world that brands him as a monster. \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off well introducing us to an unknown Ajin battling militia in Africa presumably to avoid capture and experimentation after being tranquilized he is taken away on a helicopter to some unknown location. We later presume that this is the victim of the experiments leaked on the internet. This sets us up with the understanding of how Ajin are treated. \\n\\n\r\nAjin has the setting of alternate beings that are hunted by humans and this is a concept that has been around for a while i.e. Tokyo Ghoul or Elfen Lied. The former being something I have yet to watch, but I have read the manga. So my hopes were that Ajin would exceed what I\u2019ve come accustom to with the whole \u2018monsters rise against humanity\u2019 thing and I am glad to say I was happy with the end product.\\n\\n\r\nPacing of the story was fast and it wasn\u2019t in a rush to conclude the story. Which was nice since 13-episodes felt too little to wrap up the whole saga. \\n\\n\r\nI felt that the ending wasn\u2019t anything spectacular and felt cheesy in a sense with Kei vowing to defeat the evil Mr. Sato. However I am aware that it was mainly a set-up for the upcoming series, hence why I am not too let down. \\n\\n\r\nThe story has progressed with the plot for Sato\u2019s dominance and Kei\u2019s desire to find peace and acceptance and they eventually intertwine with each other due to their links as fellow Ajin. We don\u2019t just see the stereotypical \u2018Let\u2019s save the day!\u2019 antics as Kei is very much aware that he is a target and it\u2019s not worth the torture to save a few lives for a bullshit cause. No, Kei is doing this for himself and it\u2019s refreshing to see a selfish character that is calculating enough to do what\u2019s best for himself regardless of the expense of a few lives, for that I give Ajin merits. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nKei Nagai is an average high school student, very distant from others and almost estranged from his best or former best friend Kaito. After realizing that he is an Ajin, Kei utilizes the help Kaito offers to escape the city where he is being man-hunted by authorities. Kei later meets Sato a fellow Ajin with an ulterior motive to commit acts of terrorism. It\u2019s through this encounter that Kei realizes he can\u2019t trust anybody and the experiments that lie before him in the hands of the Japanese government. \\n\\n\r\nKei is a particularly interesting character as he appears sympathetic and bold, but in actuality his actions are more beneficial for himself. Kei only appears to have genuine emotion towards he best friend Kaito and mainly puts on a front for most others including his family, school friends and others who he meets along the way, mostly for the use of his own gain.\\n\\n\r\nYu Toksaki is the secondary villain for the series. He is a government official in the Ajin branch is in charge of detaining and capturing further Ajin. His motives become apparent later on in the series and I won\u2019t spoil it. Yu uses his unorthodox methods to get results which can be hit and miss and I feel his all or nothing approach can be deadly to himself and others. \\n\\n\r\nMr. Sato is the primary villain of Ajin. Having helped a fellow Ajin escape from a research facility with what appears to be minimal effort and being one man alone, Mr. Sato embarks on a quest to gather more Ajin to rebel. After coming into contact with Kei he realizes that trying to change his mind-set is difficult and the two eventual become enemies over clash of ideals. \\n\\n\r\nI did feel that what Ajin did with Kaito and Kei\u2019s sister Eriko is literally throw them out of the window after they out-lived there usefulness towards to plot. Kei left Kaito after finding out another Ajin \u2018Mr. Sato\u2019 has Eriko held captive and once the two Ajin meet Eriko as well as Kaito are never to be seen again for the rest of the series. I didn\u2019t particularly mind this, but when their faces are on the advertised photo I expect a bigger role to be played by both of them than just the sisters stereotypical damsel in distress act and Kaito\u2019s selfless act in helping Kei escape. Maybe we\u2019ll see them more in the movies or next season? \\n\\n\r\nMain characters did receive good development primarily Kei Nagai, Yu Tosaki and Mr. Sato. I would like to get more backstory and development for Izumi Shimomura as I feel she was just a subordinate Ajin for Tosaki to use for his own goals.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI must be living under a rock because I\u2019ve never heard of Polygon Pictures before. Though given the task of using 3D animation, it was well executed. Nothing felt static and I particularly enjoyed the bad-ass scene with Mr. Sato when he stormed the government base for Ajin experiments. You lose sight of the fact that its 3D animation after a few episode and the story did well enough to carry it through any weak moments. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nSound was good, I do need to listen to the OST to get a good idea of whether or not the tracks stand out on their own. I initially watched the first episode subbed before going on to watch the dub and I\u2019d have to say that it\u2019d be best to go with the sub. Familiar voice actors Todd Haberkorn (Yu Tosaki) and Johnny Bosch (Kei Nagai) didn\u2019t do a bad job and I was particularly impressed with whoever Mr. Sato\u2019s voice actor was. I didn\u2019t feel it was particularly strong enough of a performance and if I wasn\u2019t in a lazy mood I most likely would have finished Ajin in subs. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nImmortal beings, Invisible powers that can only be seen by Ajin themselves, Ajin being experimented on by the government, a female Ajin that looks suspiciously like Ennis from Baccano? I can only deduce that Ajin is Elfen lied smashed with Baccano. There are surprisingly a lot of similarities, though I felt Ajin managed to succeed in the more serious tone that was lacking slightly in Baccano and Ajin lacked what made Elfen Lied collapse which was the cutesy comedy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were strong, but I felt that the exclusion of Eriko and especially Kaito that it was pointless to label them as main characters in the first place.  \\n\\n\r\nSeeing Kei\u2019s true nature was a bit of a surprise as I thought he would end up being a weak and whining character. \\n\\n\r\nI would like to know more about Izumi as there wasn\u2019t much development for her character in the show.\\n\\n\r\nI would also like to see Kaito again. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I couldn\u2019t find much to fault the show on. The show didn\u2019t derail from the story and it maintained a consistent pace which was admirable in comparison to other similar shows. \\n\\n\r\nI give Ajin an 8 out of 10 and a recommendation to watch the first 4 episodes and see where it takes you. \\n\\n\r\nAlternate recommendations are Baccano that also has few immortal beings, contains black comedy so beware. Another one is Elfen Lied which follows the story of Diclonius a sub-species of human that have invisible powers that can slaughter anyone and are being hunted by the Japanese government for experimental purposes. Amongst these two you can find something you like. \\n\\n\r\nThis was a long one wasn\u2019t it? As always thanks for reading and have a nice day! \\n",

            "content": "I'll start by saying I haven't read the Ajin manga; so I'm writing this based on the show's merit alone. Ajin is by no means a perfect anime, but it definitely is enjoyable. Let me try to elaborate on what you can expect going into this. \r\nFirst up is the animation. Ajin employs 3DCGI, so the show is essentially 3D but retains anime aesthetic. I've heard quite a few people bashing on this, but in my opinion it isn't as bad as it's made out to be. I feel this animation technique fits the atmosphere of the show well and often increases immersion into astory which may have otherwise been more dull at times. The two major gripes I have with the visuals are the fps and color palette. The animation is a bit choppy thanks to the low framerate. This was grating at first, but quickly faded to the back of my mind after a few episodes (I suspect annoyance with this factor will vary among people). The show also looks washed out due to the use of dark and bland colors throughout. This might have been meant to enhance the realism and grittiness of the story but I feel it detracts from the overall animation.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the actual story; Ajin doesn't have the most unique premise- there are plenty of shows about semi-humans/humanoid creatures living amongst us, hidden in fear of persecution (Tokyo Ghoul and X-Men come to mind). However, in my opinion Ajin does a great job of creating an entertaining and (almost) believable story thanks to a great antagonist, very good pacing and almost zero fluff. The plot is always progressing at a steady pace without the annoying detours, speed bumps and lack of focus that generally pepper similar series. It also helps that the music is always on point, enhancing the atmosphere and transforming average scenes into great ones. (I'd also like to mention that the opening song for the first season is pretty spectacular). All together, considering both season 1 and 2, Ajin presents a great story with a remarkably satisfying conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characterization Ajin definitely is not the prime example to point to. I'm kind of torn on how much this affects the show though. Most of the primary characters react in a grounded and human manner to the situations presented to them. There's very little of the usual tropes of over the top, illogical decision making, and protagonists overcoming situations with sheer willpower. When these situations do occur and characters do throw themselves at danger, the fact that the Ajin are immortal makes it far more believable than it would otherwise be. Getting back to the point- as I said before there's not too much character development in Ajin, but the story focused nature of this show means that this isn't too much of a problem. Most of the characters are defined well enough that they don't seem flat and uninteresting. As with any show, some are done better than others and are hence more likeable. And although I wish a little more effort had been placed into fleshing out all the cast, I get the feeling that the plot moves along at a rate where too much time spent on the characters's emotions and thoughts could have been detrimental to the pacing of the show overall.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing I have to mention about this anime- and the part that irked me the most- is how the generally realistic and pragmatic tone of the show is sometimes disturbed by illogical explanations for situations and oversight of simple solutions to problems. I don't want to go into too much detail lest I head into the realm of spoilers. You'll probably notice these moments yourself when you're watching. 'Suspension of disbelief' is always a key factor to enjoying anime, however when a show adopts a realistic tone and alludes to the importance of logic and tactics throughout, these transgressions can be particularly annoying. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you like thriller anime in general and are comfortable with 3DCGI, you'll probably enjoy Ajin a lot. (Also, I watched the dubbed version which has pretty good VA if that's something important to you)",

            "content": "Ajin focuses on our main lead, Kei Nagai, discovering he is an immortal being called an Ajin capable of resurrecting and regenerating from all damage once killed and manifesting shadowy-like forms called IBMs to fight on his behalf. This leads him to go on the run as once Ajin are discovered, they are captured and used for experimentation by the Japanese government. Also adding to this conflict is a terrorist organization made by Ajin who threaten to exploit the corruption of the Japanese government in retaliation for their treatment of Ajin.\r\nAjin is quite a bit of a mixed bag in quality, but I shall focuson the positives to the series first. The series does a solid job with fleshing out the capabilities of the Ajin as such where characters utilizing their abilities like Kei and Sato are able to analytically plan out how to use their abilities and work around their limitations, including occasions where they commit suicide to fully recover themselves in the event of injury. The series also offers some surprising twists and fleshing out of its plot for later episodes regarding the mentalities and motivations of major characters, notably with Kei and the government worker Yu Tosaki. Also, the show's animation is quite fluid with engaging action sequences and great cinematography employed during some key scene points, this shown most notably during one of terrorist operations committed by Sato and his group.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond these points though, Ajin does come with a fair number of major issues. The show's direction on being a dark and cynical world is a bit too much on the heavy side and can come off feeling forced, especially with how many humans in the series regard Ajin. This is most evident with major characters like Kei, Tosaki, and Sato who all have cynical outlooks on life and make morally questionable actions for either their own self-gain or advancement of goals. In spite of the great fluid movement by its animation, Ajin's use of 3DCG animation in a style similar to Knights of Sidonia does make its character designs look artificial in their appearance and their movements can usually look unnatural compared to how the IBMs get rendered. Also not helping matters is the series ends at a rather major point in its storyline that appeared to be deliberate in setting up Ajin's second season.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Ajin does have some engaging story elements and twists, its attempt at painting a dark and cynical mood felt forced and its key characters were hard for me to care much for. While your mileage may vary with how you warm to this series, I don't see myself being invested enough to venture into Ajin's second season.",

            "content": "Ajin was an anime that I never thought of watching at first, but it's theme, fantastically written characters, and the story behind it was what got me hooked. I learned about this anime in a Japanese Club at my university, and didn't think I'd watch it because of the art, but since I had watched RWBY, I thought it might be worth it to. The art is by far what I disliked most about this anime, because I'm not used to 3d graphics, and I prefer the 2d art style of traditional anime.\r\nNow, for the story of this series. I haven't read the manga, soI'm not qualified to write about if it's accurate or not. I found the story of this show to be incredibly complex and unique, despite shows like Tokyo Ghoul and Parasyte becoming really popular in past years. This took an incredibly realistic approach to a supernatural being like the Ajin, with many of them being tested in labs and not being able to live normal lives. It also got to the heart of how I feel many people would react in situations like these. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is good, despite being relatively limited. A lot of the background music in the show is downplayed to further the action showed, and bring forward a lot of the dialoue and other background noise that's present.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are by far the main reason why I decided to watch the show. The character of Nagai Kei surprised me by having characteristics that I wouldn't have expected out of the main character, and nearly all of the side characters have been highly developed as well, such as Kaito, Satou, and Tanaka Kouji. You find yourself rooting for many different characters all at once due to their nature and how they all deal with this situation differently.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found this anime highly enjoyable, and I hope that they make a season 2. I definitely found this anime more intriguing than many of the other shows that I have watched recently, and I may even read the manga after finishing this review. I highly recommend watching this anime, despite the strangeness of the artwork.\\n\\n\r\n(This review is the first one I've made, but I felt like I needed to finally write one for this anime. I hope you guys found this helpful!)",

            "content": "*Some Spoilers* \r\nI really enjoyed the concept of the series. Of beings that were considered immortal, but less than human, treated as nothing more than animals that needed to be put down. Their are real world scenarios to this line of thinking. Like the way we treat different types of people different ways based on their gender, race, sex, class, ethnicity, etc.\r\nI felt this story had so much potential to delve deep into what it means to be human and why that matters so much when I first read the synapse but I was disappointed. It felt more like a fighting match rather than abattle of ideologies.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is okay. Not all that exciting. The characters mostly bore me. I enjoy characters that go into an emotional rage, that express themselves with more than just a bored face so I was happy to find two characters that fit the bill at least a little bit. But only a little bit. They were at most two dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nA plus to the show is the complexity of good and evil.  This is the kind of show where you have to figure out who the real bad guy is. Everything is in a little bit of a gray area as their a bunch of factions working against each other. However, the main antagonist is 'The Man with the Hat' who is one intellectual bad ass with the powers of immortality. So in terms of having a great bad ass villain, the story succeeded.\\n\\n\r\nIt was difficult to connect with the characters, because we never really got the chance to know these characters as to why they do what they do. Like glasses guy, you learn his fiance is in a hospital but you never know why he has such a big issue with Ajin and his partner is an Ajin and no one but him seems to know that so how is it she became part of an organization that targets Ajin. \\n\\n\r\nRealistically, it's difficult to flush out all of the character development in only 13 episodes which makes me happy knowing their are two more parts to this series. Hopefully, it gets better as the story progress and we can flush out the characters more so than their Black Ghosts which every episodes seemed to be hung up on. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of the series was actual the ending. The ending theme's animation was beautiful and it connected to the varies ways the main character dies. It was creative and the ending theme was not to bad. I have high hopes for this series to develop into something great. \\n\\n\r\nRecommendation based on this anime: Tokyo Ghoul (manga better than anime)",

            "content": "I have not written a review on this website since I was 12 years old, and they were terribly written *cringe*. This anime inspired me to actually give a shot at writing a review again. \r\nFirst and foremost, the largest controversy surrounding this anime is the art -- some people outwardly refuse to watch this anime because of the way it is animated.  Please, I beg of you, try and see the beauty in it! I have never had much of a problem getting used to unique animation styles, but I won't deny the preference, I often favor the more conventional approach when itcomes to animation in an anime. BUT I, honest to god, would not change a thing about this anime's animation style. \\n\\n\r\nNOT A THING\\n\\n\r\nI know that the original fans of this story (I have not read the manga) view it as a gore/horror type of show and find the creepiness/scary factor hindered by this animation style. For myself, this alternative animation style enhanced the creepiness of the anime! In fact, I look back on some of my favorite gore animes and wish this style had been done! I am, for the most part, desensitized to classic representations of anime gore. I very rarely find anything \"creepy\" or \"scary\" based on animation anymore -- it became the voice acting that I relied on to make animes feel menacing for me. Ajin made the hair on my arms raise with just basic scenes or facial expressions. Instead of just the common \"anime pupils shrink to 1/2 their size to indicate an emotion\" it felt like I was looking at real expression that these characters felt... just like people. For example, in the very first episode a character sees something they believe is a hallucination and their facial expression looks like genuine surprise mixed with a tinge of fear. This scene wasn\u2019t meant to have a lasting impact, it was just a plain scene moving along the story and yet it encompassed my view of these characters having emotions written on their faces. To me, there is nothing creepier than feeling like I am seeing hurt on an animated character's face.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t always the case, sometimes the expressions do look very comical -- but I believe at those times it was the animators intention.\\n\\n\r\nDo the movements sometimes seem a bit awkward? Yes, sometimes the character walk as though they are obese (like they should have a beer belly or something), but it is not enough to take away from the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow the story:\\n\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, original fans of this anime champion gore as a huge motivator behind their love of this story. \\n\r\nI believe the story is good enough on its own that a simple reduction in gore does nothing to detract from the show\u2019s overall quality. Since I have not read the manga, I do not really feel like gore has been marginalized, I think it was done in a rather 'mature' way. I am not saying that anime with loads of gore are immature, but there is a sense sometimes of \u201cgore for the sake of gore.\u201d I can totally get into an anime with bloody carnage every turn and I don\u2019t believe it always hinders a story -- but at times to me it feels like overdone fanservice. This totally makes sense if the anime\u2019s story can\u2019t hold the show up on its own and gore is its selling point. Although I tend to favor meaningful story driven gore, but that is my own personal viewpoint on the gore genre in general.  When I say \u201cmature\u201d in this instance -- I mean it\u2019s trying to get you to feel horror not because you see a lot of blood, but because you can feel the character\u2019s intentions/emotions/desires/fears. When a villain in this story has blood all over the walls from the people he\u2019s killed, it isn\u2019t the blood that fills me with dread or even the way he\u2019s killed them, it\u2019s his smile when it\u2019s all over. That to me is real violent merciless gore, not endless slaughter (not to say this show doesn\u2019t have blood spills everywhere), but the desires of evil characters intentions of creating gore.\\n\\n\r\nOriginally (just episode one), the story gave me a Tokyo Ghoul feeling, but they are different animals, this show does not deal in \"filler\" of any kind. I had a lump in my throat from some form of anxiety/worry/disgust/confusion/pain the entire time I watched. There was never a chance for \"Ahh I can relax, nothing unpredictable or painful will happen.\" \\n\r\n (I plan on reading the manga, so later I may eat my words)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nNow as much as I love the story, it is definitely the characters that carry this show. There is something mysterious and unique about every character they introduce. Even the more \"bland\" ones are interesting in the fact that motivations are not introduced haphazardly. Many animes suffer from jamming painful back stories for EVERY character down the viewer's throat. Or every character's motivations are laid out in front of the audience as plain as day without leaving it to the imagination. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is a master at subtlety! I over thought why a character was doing something, and I also had things fly over my head and ate the explanations/motivations/actions/choices up with no questions asked.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character and the main villains are by far some of the most well paced character development I have ever seen. Yet, they still can surprise -- just like real people, no matter how well you know them, you cannot ever predict everyone's actions, and that is main reason these characters are so amazing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI have never really been one of the anime fans that focused on the soundtrack. In fact, I was oblivious to the background music of all animes until Ajin. I do love anime openings and ending songs, but during a show I never could pick out a time where the music impacted how I took in a scene. Ajin is now the first anime to open my eyes to the use of a good soundtrack during a show. I could tell that a certain song choice during a scene was guiding my thoughts. For example, there is a scene where a guy says an eye opening statement to one of the villains and the guys facial expression changes only very slightly, but not enough to indicate surprise. The music playing was definitely the driving force behind getting viewers to believe the villain was surprised and that in my opinion is a fabulous use of music. So in an entirely new field of opinions, I say Ajin\u2019s soundtrack was beautiful and the best I have ever come across.  \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\r\nOpening: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime, and I recommend it to everyone! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ajin has been placed into a very thoughtful rank for me, I actually gave 8 but I wanted to give 10.\r\nHere is why:\r\nThe history of the anime is actually outstanding, the goal the characters have developed, the way the episodes link together. Thats all very great, but for me and other viewers the 3D is a huge bother, it almost made me drop this amazing anime.\r\nLets talk about the 3D, first i'm not against 3D, quite the opposite I would like it to be as improved as possible to be able to include the amazing graphics it posses. The lightning effects in ajin are great,vehicles like cars and motorcycles are filled with details, some background art is very rich. Towards this points I really think the 3D works great, but when it comes to animation Ajin seem to be \"bad acted\" and how it would be \"acted\" if there is no actors? Well, lets say a crucial moment of showing emotions comes up, the way its animated and how it is shown are very poor, so poor it actually disgust me and lot of watchers, and is actually not that hard to animate a good 3D, take a look at MikuMikuDance (MMD) videos, there are some amazingly done, that people make just for enjoyment. Said that if ajin were given to lets say Madhouse Studio and got draw graphics, the whole concept would have changed and most likely received my 10.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the anime: Ajin has a very provocative plot, its messes with you to see unrighteousness, but at the same time it contains great villains that are crucial to the history development. One of the main characters has a amazing mind that surprises the viewers as the outcome isn't expected, its very well planned and this is something I must give credit to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was a Very Good anime with an outstanding story, I'll consider reading the manga to see if it surpass the anime errors.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "NOTE; this review is an overall writing of my perspective on the first season, second season, and movie adaptation. Please take this into consideration before viewing this review.\r\nIf you aren't attracted to 3D anime, then don't watch this. If you enjoy anime with a plot that actually makes sense, and characters that have relatable, understandable histories, then this is up your alley. If you don't like anime where certain characters have an unbelievable advantage over others, then don't watch anime in general.\r\nStory; 7/10 \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It's common to make the main character of a manga, or any \"original\" story a high school student before a climactic eventoccurs, resulting in his shunning and/or tormenting by a large group of people\u2014usually organizations the lead is familiar with\u2014to have the viewers relate to the character. However, this method of introduction to characters is commonly seen, and has turned a bit clich\u00e9. But, the way the story evolves, especially the position of the main character, is what makes this piece as good as it is. The nostalgia you feel when watching the main character, Kei, have to deal with the situation is very elevated, and the way his role in the anime gets shifted exponentially is appealing due to it's emotional grasp. For example; in the beginning, Kei looks like a normal high school student, whom acquires an average amount of acquaintances. But, as the story unfolds before us, we realize that Kei isn't as emotionally adept as other characters surrounding him may be, and he turns out to be quite monotonic when it comes to revealing his emotional side. He then soon begins to realize that he has people he can depend on, and he takes advantage of this and actually realizes that he has friends. That's exactly what I mean by character development and why this anime is so attractive.\\n\\n\r\nArt; 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, I know, this is 3D and rapes your eyesight because you're used to regular 2D 30 frames per second tits popping out everywhere. But, for a 3D anime, this is actually pretty bearable. I say this because of not only the characters that look physically admirable, but the effort that was put into everything. The background, or \"backdrop,\" as frequently labeled in 2D anime, is always changing, and is never actually in a suspended state. For example; 2D anime usually uses pictures instead of animated generations for backgrounds, which usually aren't all that noticeable in the long run. But, Ajin delivers a sight that's not difficult watch while the characters move. The reason I speak so highly of it is because whenever you watch an anime that's 2D, it's usually the characters and whatever actions that are affecting their environment is seen to be moving, this including any characters that have absolutely zero affect on the leads and supports; bystanders. But, stuff that you usually don't look for, like random trees, grass, smoke, and other miscellaneous objects can be seen to be affecting the background. In other words, if you're looking for a summary to what I just said; the artwork is good.\\n\\n\r\nSound; 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter; 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment; 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, this anime is very good in my opinion, and deserves to be highly rated. I think it's very pitiful that people would walk the other way just because a show is 3D. They literally use the \"judge a book by it's cover\" routine and have no sense of adventure when it comes to finding something they enjoy. In all honestly, when I came across Ajin when browsing Netflix to look for any anime to watch (because I didn't want to have to deal with the on-click ads or popups from websites such as KissAnime\u2014which I typically use). But, I was like, \"what the hell, I might as well give it a watch before I check some of this other stuff out,\" and went on my way to watch it. And, it was good after all and worth the effort of watching. \\n\\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Please don't judge an anime by it's cover or how the story is visually delivered. If you took the time to watch Ajin, I'm sure you'll come to like it when you actually watch it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall; 10/10",

It saves the anime studios lots of money to do it like that. Of course in real life we can't stay absolutely still, and tend to move and sway a bit while talking.\r\nWatching Ajin was an aesthetic, albeit peculiar, experience. It was my first completely CGI anime and the difference in animation was palpable. I liked how the characters swayed and moved a bit in what would typically be still shots; I enjoyed seeing the gentle clarity to the illustrations and watching thecharacters' eyes move. I recommend CGI for those anime veterans who may be a bit jaded by the medium's lack of realism, which is but a product of the industry's lack of money.\\n\\n\r\nIt was also interesting to watch action among characters that get back up after dying. Immortality in that sense removes the possibility of death and therefore the driving anticipation that is behind most of our actions... as a soldier, you can use your body in ways you normally can't, because you know you're not going to die permanently.\\n\\n\r\nShould such anomalies -- Ajin -- be treated differently in society? Shunned, scorned, sought after for government experimentation?\\n\\n\\n\r\nRATINGS\\n\r\nEnjoyment -- 9.6\\n\r\nResonance -- 6.8\\n\r\nOverall Quality -- 8",

            "content": "A wise man once said, \"I may not know art, but I know what I like.\" I cannot say I am an expert on art, myself, but I do know what I like when it comes to Anime. I like something that keeps me engrossed, watching, and inspires emotion. Something that makes me invest my emotions into it. That takes a good story, characters, and presentation. I will always sacrifice the last one in favor of the first two. But, \"Ajin\" has given me food for thought to reconsider. Never ever have I seen an Anime where the art detracted so much from the overallshow itself. \\n\\n\r\nI saw a story that hits the ground running, nothing unique, but the concept of the fugitive is one so easily botched. This is a world where there are humans that cannot be killed called \"Ajin\". They can be hurt, but if they die, they regenerate all damage. Doesn't matter what kind. There are very few known in this world and the ones that are have a steep price on their heads. Our main character, Kei Nagai, gets outed as an Ajin and the chase is on. He laments over his situation a bit too much for my liking, he's not the nicest kid in the world, a bit of a jerk, but you can easily sympathize with him. Why? \\n\\n\r\nBecause we know this- an Ajin who is caught is experimented on cruelly and inhumanly in a variety of torturous methods. Needless to say, this causes resentment from other Ajin towards humans. Now, I mention our primary antagonist- Satou, \"The Man in the Hat\"- one of the more capable and menacing foils I have seen in a long time. He's a brilliant tactician, capable with a gun, and can use his Ajin abilities to their fullest. All while looking like a 1920s construction worker. Both the protagonist and antagonist are hunted by Yuu Tosaki, a determined government agent who is sort of a specialist in hunting Ajin. Think of him as a \"Man in Black\" except he wears a white suit and is followed by his pretty little assistant, Izumi Shimomura, making him look like the world's most anal retentive pimp. Like most government dogs however, their corporate demeanor only hides secrets of their own, I won't spoil those, but once their backgrounds are flushed out, they become a little more likeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe show moves at very fast pace, with many scenes of violence and death, which is little more than an inconvenience and some times a helpful thing to an Ajin. I found this show highly binge worthy with is quickly becoming a trademark of \"Netflix\" original series. But, then we come back to the art... oh, goodness, gracious, googly-moogly- the art! Using a lot pre-rendered CG models that give the appearance of Anime style animation, it only succeeds in taking any life away from the characters and makes them look like plastic puppets. Capable of mimicking the facial expressions involved with emotions, but they have no soul. This looks like a video game. On top of that, the animation is so choppy, the stuttered frame-rate will have you cringing at first and possibly checking your internet connection- it's not you, it's them. This was a killer for me. To have good characters and story and then sell out for this cheap copy of what is supposed to be Japanese animation is a tragedy of epic proportions.\\n\\n\r\nEven a good voice cast (which is available in 5 languages) cannot help bring these cold images of people to life. In the Sub vs. Dub battle, I have to give the win to the Japanese cast for providing more authenticity and being assisted big time by having the great Mamoru Miyano in the lead (who even lends his singing voice to the end credits theme) but this does not take away from the English cast who benefit as much by having the ever-talented Johnny Yong Bosch as their lead. I also liked the German cast's performance, Uwe Jellinek seemed to fit Satou best out of all the actors who voiced him. But still, we come back to the art...\\n\\n\r\nThe art (or lack thereof) took away so much and makes a good Anime out of what should easily be a very good or even a great Anime. I feel rather like Charlton Heston at the end of \"Planet of the Apes', upset, crying, angry at the sight of self-destruction. They had something genuinely good and they destroyed it. This stands as a reminder that not all Anime is the same. The art we take for granted in consistency, vibrancy, and color that so many other, less quality, stories have employed and crapped out time and time again is so sorely missed here. I am very tempted to tell you to skip this one, but the story remains one of the better I have seen in a while. And for that reason and maybe that reason alone, I give this show a 7/10. Check it out. And those 3 points I took away could have and should have been the easiest ones to earn. Darn it all to heck...",

            "content": "The action sequences and the mythology surrounding the ajins themselves made this an interesting show. But I couldn't get into it as much as I'd hoped, due to a few nagging flaws.\r\nStory - 8/10:\r\nThere are some really interesting ideas to be explored in this story, that don't necessarily get the screen time they deserve. The idea that Satou is challenging the status quo of a country that treats ajins like monsters, rather than humans, could have been deftly handled and intellectually stimulating. But the idea of ajin civil rights is really just lip service. What we actually get is a terrorist organization taking on thegovernment, while most of the time the viewer is following Kei around as he learns more about what he is.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the story not really going in the direction I would have preferred, I still found the action to be fun to watch, and there was a good amount of intensity. Satou was a legitimately terrifying antagonist, which added a level of suspense to the show. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 5/10:\\n\\n\r\nI've read some other reviews where they got into the technical deficiencies present in the artwork and animation of Ajin. I don't have much expertise in that field. All I can say is that this show looks off. The characters often look funny when moving, and the style is a little off-putting. It was definitely a drawback for me, which is unfortunate - there's a ton of potential for some great style and animation given the material.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10: \\n\\n\r\nI watched the English dub and found the voices to be well-done, if nothing special. The music was solid, and the theme songs were fine. Nothing great, nothing bad. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nThis is really where Ajin lost me (in addition to the weird art style). I feel like the writer is trying way too hard to present every party as being morally grey. Satou and his crew are standing up for civil rights, but at the same time they're killing people. Kei is the viewer surrogate, but he's kind of a cold-hearted dick. The government officials are trying to defend themselves against the terrorists, but constantly show incredible cruelty and malice towards others (particularly Ajin). It's fine to present stories full of three-dimensional and morally questionable characters - The Wire would be my shining example of that idea done well. The problem is that when it's done poorly (or even mediocrely) you run the risk of presenting a story where the viewer has no rooting interest. I don't know which side I'm supposed to be on in this show, and neither side felt fun to root for.\\n\\n\r\nKei, in particular, was all over the place character-wise. In the early episodes he's presented as a driven young man who has sort of cast off emotion in order to pursue excellence, giving him a bit of a cold personality. But he's also shown going out of his way to help people, saving people numerous times at great risk to himself. However, that never really gets built on, and even by the end of the second season it's unclear what type of person he is. It's not character growth to have someone vacillate between good and bad/cold. He certainly doesn't come off as a likeable character, which is not a good thing when he's the primary focus of the story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nI'm probably scoring this a bit higher than it deserves, but I'm an easy grader when it comes to enjoyment. Despite not finding this to be a great show, I never felt outright bored or disinterested. It was always intriguing to see what plan Satou would come up with next, or whether Kei would be able to come up with a plan to overcome him. The action and suspense added to the overall enjoyment - there's a good amount of forward momentum to the plot, keeping the viewer interested, if not enthralled.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10:\\n\\n\r\nAjin was a bit of a disappointment, though still a reasonably good show. I had high hopes for how it would handle the ideas of ajin civil rights vs public safety, but it never really went anywhere (maybe that's a longer-term goal of the source material, I'm not sure). It still manages to be a fun action show, given the nice set pieces involving Satou's attacks.",

While Ajin was somewhat entertaining for a season with fun twists and turns, new characters, etc., by season two, it just became unbearably predictable and overly dramatic with minimal to no character development that I only watched it just to be done with it. Literally, just left it running in the background while I was working and would flip to it if it sounded like there may have been a cool action sequence. That was really it.\r\nAlso, the singing in season two's end theme (by CreepHyp?) is so horribly off-key, I actually dreaded the end of the episodesI would start checking how much time was left. Really, if you're musically inclined, you'll know what I mean. It actually made me physically cringe...and I'm not alone on this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, not great.

I wouldn't recommend this to a friend, but I wanted to see where the story would go.\\n\r\nSo if you have time to lose and nothing else to watch, that could be a good choice, mostly because it's not that bad.\\n\r\nIf you don't need a story to be logic, or characters to be deep, that could be a good choice.\\n\r\nIf there is a second season, I wont watch it.",

            "content": "For me, Ajin is a good anime: good story, good art and good character creation.\r\nThe story of city monsters who are hunted is always an interesting theme, and producers have developed it skillfully to make a dramatic and attractive anime. However, there are many points that I can't understand, or in other words, they sometimes fail to convince me. Before Sato acts, ajin are completely harmless to humanity, and they're not scary. So, why do people loathe them? The background of the ajin is the modern world, so I don't see why people treat them like this just because they are different.\r\nAbout character, I reallylike Nagai Kei. He is even one of my favorite anime characters. He is a main character who doesn't have to be a hero, or possess infinite goodness or always worry about others. Selfish, but very smart and not morally loose. He never does anything useless, thinks quickly but carefully and effectively, and completely concentrates on his target. It makes me shiver with excitement when I think how strong he can become. Sato is also not bad, a warlike old man. And government camp has some interesting characters, too. But the supporting characters are too insipid. There are not a lot of details to show their motives, so I feel that they are like inanimate puppets.\\n\\n\r\nAjin's art is good, too. 3D technology was used to make it. This is a new technology and there aren't a lot of anime which are made by it like Ajin. So, some people feel uncomfortable with it. But I think without this technology, this anime can not be as lively as it is now, especially IBM's illustration.",

But....\r\nAs the story goes, I found those animation style really brings out characters emotion and feelings from how they moved, and I found the action scene's quite good too, I realized they did the right thing to turn the animation style being 3D or 2.5D like.\r\nThen, let's define the good quality in this anime: (Spoiler Alert!)\r\n1. The sounds, voice acting, I found them really amazing. Like the explosion scene, the explosionsounds really nailed it. And I liked how they do the voice acting, plus, the animation matched the voice acting that makes me really impressed.\\n\\n\r\n2. Characters, yes, some support characters that could have more air time actually didn't received it. But that aside, the Main Protagonist's childhood friend is actually really good that he gave me the impression of a main hero in this anime, then the main antagonist (Sato from my perspective), I will say that he's badass that I could love him. And some other antagonist characters that I found very lovable. The author sure got some good sense in characters buildup.\\n\\n\r\n4. While not yet finished, the whole Idea of Ajin is somehow gave me the thrill that close to our world's situation, about Ignorance, Racial conflict, monetary problems, and how reasoning could affect the feelings of people arounds you. Yep, the buildup is pretty solid, though it's a shame that the MC's childhood friend did not get more air time. And I hope Ajin 2nd season project could be done.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad quality is\\n\r\nI've said it several times already, yes, it's some characters air time. The MC's childhood friend could have important role, yet, he killed off (the air time) in the 2nd episode If I'm not mistaken, that's really a let down, It feels like he's just no one in this anime. I hope if there's 2nd season, he'll have a proper air time.\\n\r\nOther than that, It's all clear.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it, I really recommend this anime if you are looking for something like Tokyo Ghoul or Parasyte -the Maxim. It's a great Anime so far, but don't expect it to be complete, though it's really an enjoyable anime. Go for it.",

            "content": "Immortal beings have been the subject of fiction since the beginning of time, but Ajin puts a logical spin on it with clearly defined rules that mostly make sense.\r\nAjin is the story of Nagai Kei, a normal schoolboy who gets dragged into the world of the hunted when he finds out that he is an Ajin, a member of a race of immortal humans. The story is an action thriller where things pick up rapidly, with its relentless pacing and innumerable plot twists. I wasn't too sold on the premise at first as it felt like something which existed for shock value like Akame gaKill or Gantz, but things moved pretty logically which proved itself to be something different.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the show can be distracting. Polygon Pictures weaves its usual CGI magic with its unnatural movements and ugly human models, but it manages to get the most important thing right: the faithfulness of the story. Ajin is helmed by a great director who puts the show's great backgrounds to good use, the characters may not look good but the environment sure does, especially in the show's bigger set pieces. \\n\\n\r\nAnother positive about the show is in how good it sounds, a similarity it shares with the recent Polygon Pictures anime Knights of Sidonia. Ajin has a great soundtrack, with an opening and ending which are both well done, especially the sound design: the sounds of each character's supernatural abilities echo horrifyingly and always serves to build tension in the scene. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the story doesn't end with much closure; this TV anime is most likely an advertisement for the movie sequels coming out later this year. It ends on a cliffhanger, and since the rest of the series are movies, it is very likely we will only manage to watch the rest of the story more than a year later. Another gripe I have is that the plot starts becoming more illogical near the end of the series, which makes me worry that the series will go off the rails with the plot later on.\\n\\n\r\nThese are small caveats though; in the end I found Ajin to be a show worth watching. A thriller that manages to engross its audience for majority of the ride is a rare thing in anime, which makes Ajin one of the shows that deserves a bigger audience than it gets.",

I always try to push past those thoughts, because that is how I have found some of the best anime I've seen. Sometimes there is much more than meets the eye.\r\nInitially I thought the art would be the hardest to accept because I have a massively hard time enjoying an anime that has animation similar to a video game. \r\nInterestingly, I realized that I did really enjoy the artwork, as well as the special effects. Usually anime that have game-type animation aren't my style to say thevery least, but I ended up enjoying it to my extreme shock. Some may find it to be the same for themselves. \\n\\n\r\nI felt that it brought a lot of interesting material to the table. In season 1 you learn bits and pieces of things, but the way everything is played out gives me a decent enough reason to give a good score for it's story line. \\n\\n\r\nIn many ways it holds similarities to Tokyo Ghoul. The character must learn to cope with something he never had to before, he has to isolate himself from the world, especially cops, AND lastly, though he tries to remain \"human\" for the most part, he has lost what makes him human. In both shows, the characters must adapt to a new form of life.\\n\\n\r\nBack onto season 1...Season 1 was interesting in my opinion. The pacing was right, the characters were interesting, and the art was pretty good. I am hoping season 2 is a bit more exciting, but the show did manage to keep me entertained enough to finish it quickly.\\n\\n\r\nJust make sure to watch it in 720px or 1080px because I imagine that the art would look pretty rough in a lower quality...",

And by that I mean that I have some favorite anime which I absolutely love but I give them for example 5 or 6/10 because, yeah, I'm trying to objective.\r\nFirst of all I want to mention CHARACTERS: 10.\r\nthey are so incredibly well written. Especially main characters are very deep, you can understand their personality and motivation. Well written characters is what I personally appreciate the most. And honestly,m it is such a rare thing. \r\nFor example one of the main characters, Kei, is clearly a psychopath,nothing to add or take. There are a lot of movies and series which are trying to add a psychopath character, but usually they either overdo or miss some details. Writers of Ajin did such a great job capturing what a true nature of a psychopath is, and Kei is demonstrating it throughout all series. I bow with respect. Even side characters are written in a way which makes them seem very real and alive.\\n\\n\r\nART: I am hesitating, but let's give it fair 5.\\n\r\nA lot has been said about animation. Studio clearly put A LOT of work into it: the details and light is incredible, facial expressions are awesome. The problem is that if during fighting scenes animation has all 60 fps, it drops down during all other scenes. This is indeed annoying, but I don't feel like giving this anime 1/10 like some people do just because of this.\\n\r\nArt is actually great, realistic, lights/shadows are wonderful, details and facial \\n\r\nexpressions are just incredible, but 90% of the time FPS is way too low. This is unacceptable. I don't really understand what was the problem to make 60 fps throughout all series.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8\\n\r\nSome people are talking here about dark side of humanity, which is beyond me. \\n\r\nThe story is just a really good action with well placed suspense, with very good action scenes, and very interesting characters development. I wouldn't talk about philosophical things here. This is just too much. It's an action anime about supernatural abilities. Don't overthink things where it is not needed.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10\\n\r\nLast time I was so excited yelling \"Omg this is so dope and badass!\" when watched John Wick xD I think you get the idea here xD",

It can't be avoided however if possible try to look past that. Ajin is a show very similar to parasyte and tokyo ghoul.\r\nIt's the kind of anime that pits two sides against each other, and makes one of the sides opressed. Ajin does something quite weird however, it takes the focus a little bit away from the main character, and focuses more on the supporting characters.\r\nWhile the maincharacter is still very important and relevant to the story, a little over half of the first season focuses more on building up the scenario and giving information. Now this is clearly not unheard of, actually it's quite normal. but a little different from, say parasyte.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of ajin is like i mentioned very reminiscent of stuff like parasyte. It's not unheard of, but the physical abilities of the ajin make the story quite a bit different from parasyte, I'm not saying this is either good or bad, just different.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is probably what puts most people off from watching this, but if you're intrigued by the story, don't make the art put you off.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is not easily noticeable, there are a few good ones here and there, but not something of great significance. The opening however, is in my opinion really good.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are definetly one of the series' strong points. This especially goes for nagai and satou. Nagai is a very interesting main character as he's not a bad person, but not a good person either, more of a neutral ground, which i think was actually a very good decision on the authors part.\\n\\n\r\nAs for overall enjoyment, I won't say it's one of the greates anime, but i still enjoyed it, even with the 3D animation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, what i have to say about this anime is, don't let the 3D animation put you off, at least give it a chance. Also if you're a person who likes parasyte or tokyo ghoul, I highly recommend ajin. However, if you really can't get yourself to watch 3D animation, then don't bother\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review, so a lot of it was just me rambling, I hope you don't mind",

(No spoilers so don't worry)\r\nStory (5) : Well to me the idea of the anime seems pretty cool and as I said I really expected to like it, but there was simply no way that it was good. Everything that happened was expected and it wasn't \"catchy\". The thing that surprised me the most about this anime was that I finished watching it. .\r\nArt (1) : OMG IF YOU LIKE GOOD ART SAVE YOUR EYES AND DON'T WATCHTHIS. It is bad 3D animation, that actually ruined most of the feelings you could get from this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8) : It pains me to say that something in Ajin was good but I actually enjoyed the sound, the opening and ending had great songs and the sound effects during the anime were pretty good. It just didn't get a full 10 because the animation didn't catch up with the voice acting sometimes and that was really annoying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (3) : I really like an anime that makes me feel empathy for the characters, that's one of the things that I enjoy the most while watching something, and\"experiencing\" the \"same\" feelings as the characters is one of the most important things that an anime must do. Well I just couldn't get the characters of Ajing, I only thought \"wtf??\" all the time during the anime and the plot didn't even fell like \"smart moves\". In fact I only gave a 3 for character because of izumi's blushes hehe\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5) : Well I'm not the kind of person that \"likes\" to say that an anime was bad as I understand that its a loootttt of work to actually \"produce\" an anime but I just couldn't enjoy Ajin. Maybe you'll disagree with me and to be honest I hope you do and actually enjoy this anime if you watch it, but I can't say that I recommend it. I really didn't enjoy Ajin :/\\n",

            "content": "Interesting insight into Japanese psyche. Scared of one's own anger. The need to be drawn up into yourself and hide behind a pretense of logic. The desire to completely deride white guys and the USA is something I forgot happens with such vehemence. The DoD agents, with the lumbering, intimidating blonde guy snapping at his blonde woman assistant, slapping her, to keep quiet will certainly remind Japanese women how much less \"crude\" (this word was used for the USA in the early part of the show!) and more caring Japanese men are (mega sarcasm eye roll). I wish everyone would just come out and sayhow their insecurities guide their bigotry! It would be a lot easier for people to identify with each other if we were a bit more genuine with the motives behind our blanket generalizations (which are fun to make, but should simply be treated honestly, I mean). \\n\\n\r\nBesides their issues with the USA and white dudes (and the white women are portrayed with huge boobs too, and as submissive, but eerily aggressive to Japanese women - strange and funny), the show is really good, and I'm not sure why others thought the animation and visuals were sub par - I found them to be really thoughtful. The characters are really relatable and flawed. Great character development.\\n\\n\r\nI'm almost through the second season - really enjoying the show.",

Okay, let's begin with the overall anime, \"Ajin.\" Ajin's story is fantastic, it's understandable, and you are mostly likely not going to get confused. The art I'm not fond of because it is almost not like anime, but anime at the same time, you know? It's really 'unique' in a way. The sound quality is fantastic, but sometimes I need to put my iPad to max to hear some parts, but other then that sound quality is ace. The charcters are understable and relatable, andyou are likely to enjoy this one in a kind anime. My overall rating is a 9 out of 10, which is responable, but if you are wondering why it is a 9 and not a 10, the art is making me cringe at times. \\n\\n\r\nI would mostly likely recommened this to anyone.

I feel that if it was in any other style, they wouldn't have been able to convey as much as they did. \r\nI also love how the mangaka was able to make their main character so shitty, I mean people usually put low scores for a shitty mc, but his character and voice actor were amazing. His personality makes me hate him, and I love that they were ableto achieve that. Props^^\\n\\n\r\nI honestly haven't been watching anime lately because of all the crappy anime that's been coming out, but Ajin has revived me.\\n\\n\r\nIt is always worth it to try something new, despite low reviews, because their opinion is not YOUR opinion.

CGI animation can be quite annoying, and in my case, I did not get used to it in any moment. \r\nThe story is very good, it can pass emotion and catch the viewer, besides presenting a morally ambiguous protagonist and one of the best anime villains that ever existed. Unfortunately there are some flaws in the script. But nothing that does not make the anime reach note 8 ... except the CGI animation that becomes uncomfortable. \r\n7 is a fair note, because the anime is veryinteresting but the production has lowered the quality of the anime. \\n\r\nIf you are looking for a lively and intelligent anime, this is ideal. Intelligent not for being reflective but for being unpredictable and using very interesting concepts.",

            "content": "The anime in this review is quite interesting. You firstly have the main character, a black-haired little boy who is some kind of study nerd that suddenly becomes a half-human, half-demon like creature. Then there is his best friend (or ex-best friend, whatever). A blond guy that does not care about school that much. And then there is a old, white-haired man with always closed eyes (you that , when they draw eyes like a thick line in anime) that wants to help him, when the government wants to catch him. Oh, and not any branch, a special unit of the government made just tocatch those \"monsters\".\\n\r\nNo guys, this won't be a Tokyo Ghoul review, I already did that one. It is the first review on a 2016-anime, AJIN. Let the critics begin.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT AND STORY LINE\\n\r\nYou know how everyone sees Guilty Crown as a Code Geass rip-off. Well, Ajin is even worse. It took so many obvious segments of Tokyo Ghoul, you can't even believe that they actually did that. Guilty Crown has at least a good story whereas Ajin, has again something similar to Tokyo Ghoul. A little nerd boy suddenly becomes a half-monster. I think we already saw that one. \\n\r\nThe story begins some 19 years before in Africa, where a new species's been discovered called Ajin. Ajin are immortal beings with a couple of supernatural abilities that still look like ordinary humans. There have been a couple of Ajin reported worldwide. Still they don't seem so real for most of the citizens because they only see them sometimes in the news or read about them in textbooks. Nagai, Kei was one of those citizens until a certain accident turned his life upside-down. On his way back home, he got into a traffic accident. A truck hit him, but when everyone expected him to be dead, Kei just stood up again. Everyone was certain that he was an Ajin. \\n\r\nNow, when it comes to the story of this anime, it is an action loaded mystery, horror and supernatural story that really only follows our main protagonist. No side stories, no background stories, only the present and Kei. \\n\r\nThis would probably be the part of a review where I say stuff like this story is really interesting, or the plot it self is really catchy, but...I won't. The story is okay. And that's it. It is just okay. In the first four episodes it was because of all the Tokyo Ghoul similarities, but even though it changed afterwards, it was still...I don't want to say it was boring, because it wasn't. It just didn't give you the feeling of enjoyment. I did not enjoy it, but maybe you will. So once again, the story is okay. It is not boring, it is watchable, but it is also not something that will make you watch it in one day, even tough it has only 13 episodes. \\n\r\nThe second season has also been announced and it will start airing in October, 2016. And at this very point I want to say, I probably won't give it a try. I think I'll want to read somewhere what happened in the end, but I certainly won't watch it. I just think it's worth my time. So...yeah. That's it about the plot and story line.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nThe characters are surely more interesting than the plot. The funny thing about this anime's characters is that the \"negative characters\" are in the limelight. Negative characters like Kei, Satou, Tosaki are the leading characters of the anime while the \"good guys\" like Izumi, Kaito and Eriko are in the background. My favorite character was Kei's friend Kaito. Although we didn't get to see much of him, I liked him. He's cool. But I guess I should say a few words about our main character:\\n\r\nNAGAI KEI is one of those characters you hate in anime. He looks so cute and innocent but is just an self-centered crybaby. He is always thinking about his self. I mean, even his little sister hates him. He forgot about his best friend who again came to help him when Kei was in trouble. He is using everyone and even pretends to like them or be helpful just to gain their trust. He is the first character I really wish to see dead. Which is after all possible considering the fact that he has the government and the other ajin against him. \\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION AND STYLE\\n\r\nTwo words describe this anime's animation and style: Nice try! It's obvious that the makers of Ajin tried something new, something fresh. But when the anime ends up looking like a bad video game...That's not good. The movements are slow and there is no detail. Moreover, the colors in the anime are too dull. I know it's a horror anime, but seriously, how about a bit brightness? \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nTo conclude, you might like Ajin, because it is not a boring story and there are some quite interesting segments. The action in the anime is awesome and that's the only good thing I remember about it. I didn't like it that much and I certainly won't watch the second season. It is still freaking me out how many similarities it has with Tokyo Ghoul, because I am a huge fan of it. In my personal opinion Ajin deserves a 7/10, but there is a possibility that you might like it.",

            "content": "I actually enjoyed this alot. Although I am usually not very interested in 3-D -like anime, this one didn't turn me away. It was sort of in the middle line between 2D and 3D. I liked the art very much the characters movements were very smooth and they didn't look too skinny like in other 3D animes (CGI?) \r\nThe story was pretty interesting to say, I have seen many other anime on demi-humans and such, but this one was different. The main protag was not a superlikeable guy, he refers to himself as heartless and that he doesn't feel much for others. He does thingsfor his own benefit. But I feel that isn't truely the case, he does display signs of affection and such to his sister and gratefulness to his friends, but somehow the sister makes him out to be the heartless one. After watching this season I headed onto the other season, but I am not going to write about that here because the reviews would be very different.. the sound was good, characters voices weren't annoying and the opening was great. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters, sometimes I feel some characters don't get as much shine as they deserve. For instance, the main character's friend, he supports the MC, even though the MC doesn't do much for him. He is a supportive character and should be the one by the MC's side as the MC struggles through the difficult phase of his life. The story is about the protag escaping from a world of demi-humaning persecuting society in Japan. The protag lived a very normal life, but when he finds out he is demi-human( they don't die and use these dark shadowlike beings to fight) his world turns upside down. The Mc's friend decides to help the protag escape from the demi-human exterminating force, but later on he does not appear much. Other characters perspectives are shown as well, and it makes the story a whole lot better. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I did enjoy it very much. But there were some flaws in this story I did not like, such as the way some of the plot developed and how some characters were excluded from their should be deserved positions and you will be left wondering, what the heck happened to them? I cried at some moments, got angry for the MC. Overall, it was good. I recommend this to people who like demi-humans and people trying to change a society of its unjust values.",

It actually worked to make the story better [Example: The subtle eye movements and hesitating movements of the characters]. It worked out well for the animation for once. I found the story extremely fascinating and lack for a better word; Twisted! The idea that you can die and die again and to experience it, the amount of mental pain this would cause is immense. \r\nWhat made me wonder though, was that if Ajin cannot die, why do they still age? Or do they stop aging the moment theyrealize they are an Ajin? I wish this had more clarification. As for sound, I actually loved the sound the Ajin make when they come back alive or when their counterpart was summoned. It was kind of addicting to listen to. I love how dark this anime got. I'm glad that they tapped into the darker sides of life. It really had me entranced. \\n\\n\r\nDespite all that, I probably wouldn't watch it again. The animation was somewhat of an eyesore but I'm happy to say that I've watched it. IDK, if it wasn't for the animation I'd probably watch it again.",

I............................................................................................whoops, I accidentaly died from a heart attack from too much hype for season 2. Oh crap....I'm an AJIN!!!\r\nStory (9.5/10) Finally, an original story. Ajin are people who are immortal and some, called variants, can summon ibms, black ghosts. Kei Nagai discovers that he is an ajin and must run away from getting taken by scientists for expirements. \r\nArt (10/10) This seems to be the biggest drawback for most people. For me, its the best part. The art is verydifferent, CGI in a 2d-ish style. The character movements were very realistic. The action scenes were very fluid and awesomely done. I loved the character designs as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) The Soundtrack got me pumped for action and fit very well. The opening was pretty good. I loved the song, but all of the op animation is just animation from the show. At least its honest, but a little on the lazy side. But the English dub was in my opinion amazing. Especially the voice for Sato. The ED was okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10) The main character Kei Nagai wasn't a whiny weak protagonist. He was very strong in his goals and will do anything to accomplish them. Tosaki was interesting as well. The best character was definetly Sato. He was very cool and had a great eng dub voice actor. However, I think that some characters weren't expanded on much and were eventually forgotten. Hopefully season 2 will answer these questions. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9.5/10) The only time when I didn't absolutely have a blast with Ajin was in the first half of episode 1. Simple as that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nVery unique and well written story\\n\r\nLikeable characters\\n\r\nFantastic art and animation\\n\r\nGood soundtrack\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nSome characters lack development and screen time\\n\r\nNot over (season 2 in October)\\n\r\nI cant wait anymore\\n\r\nI NEEED MOOAR\\n\r\nMOOOAAAR\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9.4\\n",

I do not want anyone to contradict, even if the rules for compiling reviews contradict each other. This is nothing to keep them to have to write much more and more blurry.

I hope if this gets a third season, I hope they explore this front too. \r\nOverall the show is good. It has a good plot, characters are average except Kaito, fuck Kaito and his weird morals and his weird obsession with Nagai. He is so much obsessed with Nagai's safety even after Nagaitreated him like shit. \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, this adds another layer to the main character, showing what they truly believe in. \\n\r\nI'd definitely recommend the show.",

But just like manga it didn't make me connect with the characters. Some characters I am more interested in, but because the manga was slow-paced I don't believe I'll be reading it to get to know the character.\r\nWhat I like to commend is the art style. It's refreshing, even though it needs some time getting used to it. After the first few minutes you forget it is a bit laggy. Having watched other 3D animated shows like Teenage MutantNinja Turtles and Green Lantern: The Animated Series. It was such a relief that a anime was made in 3D. \\n\\n\r\nSomething I like to adress is the cast of voice-actors. If you have watched more anime in the past and especially very popular ones like Naruto or Death Note, you are going to find a few familiar voices. And the familiar voice can be a bit offsetting when you watch it further.\\n\\n\r\nI have high hopes for 3D series. And Ajin is a great show to start with.",

            "content": "Story: One of the most strong points of Ajin is the story/plot. It\u2019s much like a groundbreaking story in lot of ways. The story is about the existence of a special species called Ajin was discovered in Africa. They are said to be immortal beings, with several supernatural abilities, that look just like any other human being. In Japan, A boy named Nagai Kei has discovered himself to be an Ajin an since they are considered as immortal beings, people in Japan are doing experiment on Ajin by capturing them and the story goes further from there. The story is always on the continuous sothere are plenty of Actions involved in it but definitely in my eyes it\u2019s not your typical action story because the writers definitely put their thoughts in it deeply. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters of Ajin are pretty interesting and something to look forward to. The main protagonist Nagai Kei is a big sociopath which is very rare for a main character. However, the main action mostly involves with antagonist of the series old man satou (one of the best antagonist I have seen in recent years). All I can say the antagonist sort of overshadowed the protagonist till the last EP). In terms of character development, I think it\u2019s pretty decent, not all the characters have been developed nor it needed. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Now this might be the most debatable section of all. The art and animation are all done CGI (Computer Graphics) which became a reason for lot of people for turn off. However, I think polygon pictures have done a wonderful job with CGI and making it much more realistic though I think background was not pretty on the eye. Now I think about it I think if they made it in normal animation the fight scene might not be looked as good as it would have been. You just have to look at the action sequence of Ajin battles, they are incredible. \\n\\n\r\nMusic & OST: Definitely candidate for best Music of 2016. The opening is very good as well as ending. The OST are just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: All I can say despite the series being far from finished (the third Ajin movie might finish the rest), this anime needs to be more attention because Ajin will definitely be one of the highlights of 2016 and to be honest I loved the series overall. In terms of overall, I think Ajin is not a masterpiece but it\u2019s very much close to it. So final words if the CGI is only reason that makes you uninterested then you have miss a very good adaption, CGI might be the future and Ajin has proved you can watch CGI anime with having the taste of realistic effects. \\n",

            "content": "I believe this anime really deserves a chance.\r\nAnybody who decides to watch Ajin, may need some time to get used to the animation style (3D), as it looks quite different from the majority of animes out there.\r\nI eventually did grow used to it (say, after 3 to 4 episodes). As a matter of a fact, I even grew fond of it, because it definitely added some depth to the anime (expression-wise).\r\nThere is what I would refer to as a \"marionette-effect\", as the characters converse, move and interact.\r\nThey tend to appear as if they're manipulated by a puppet master, who pulls (invisible) strings to make thecharacters move accordingly, (if you've ever played adventure games, where the main character's head follows your mouse pointer wherever you aim, you'll probably understand what I mean).\\n\\n\r\nAnd for this reason, Ajin may feel a bit funny to the eye at first, because at times the characters' heads and limbs move abruptly, in a rather unnatural fashion (to the point where it's very obvious).\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this visual \"marionette-effect\" ironically did add a layer of realism to this anime, because it had the characters mimicking real life emotions (through their posture and movement, in very detailed ways even).\\n\\n\r\nSo even though it looked a bit awkward some of the time, at other times the movements were really spot-on and it felt like watching real people interact with each other :).\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I found the facial expressions not possessing the same level of sophistication (sometimes rather bland), but still good enough to convey the right message.\\n\\n\r\nI do believe this is because the graphic designers probably still need some practice in getting it to look right.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, I really liked it! I'm not easy to please when it comes to that, as I'm very keen on logics, and Ajin's story progression did make sense.\\n\\n\r\nI was especially fond of the battle scenes :). These looked amazing & enticing in 3D-style. It was like watching a movie and I was completely absorbed by them.\\n\\n\r\nThe movements were very graceful, swift, powerful and well executed (without seeming overdone) - plus, they looked realistic and made quite a visual impact.\\n\\n\r\nI was equally charmed by the character development (especially the protagonist - Kei Nagai, gradually showing what he's really made of).\\n\\n\r\nWhat was mentioned about him in the anime, did corroborate with the way he behaved (as in, being rather cool, detached, calculated). Not only was he described as such, but his behaviour actually did reflect this.\\n\\n\r\nI've watched animes where characters are sometimes described being a certain way, without these supposed characteristics being demonstrated throughout the animation.\\n\\n\r\nIn Ajin, the characters all have very distinct (and very believable) personalities (which ultimately kept me coming back for more, as I considered it being one of the stronger & valuable aspects in this anime).\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I found the OST more than good enough (though lacking in originality). The sound effects were of high quality and did a very good job at supporting the visual content.\\n\\n\r\nI'm really hoping there will be a second season, as it would add a lot more value and perhaps uncover more about the Ajin phenomenon as it is very intriguing!\\n\\n\r\nkeywords: life, death, crisis, friendship, persecution, radicalism, combat, sci-fi/supernatural\\n\\n\\n",

The two best scenes in the show were both fight scenes, because the added dynamic is pretty interesting.

            "content": "[warning: mild spoilers]\r\nHistory has shown that people are hostile towards each other and try to press their advantages like money to the fullest by using the surrounding people. That holds especially true with people from other races or other mindsets. So what would happen, if anyone was immortal? There are two options. Either they live in peace and are ignored or unknown to the world, or scientists want them as fast as possible as experimental subjects. And this cruel reality behind special traits is shown in Ajin.\r\nIn this series, the protagonist Nagai Kei is an Ajin and thus is immortal and holds supernatural abilities. Buthis luck runs out as he's run over by a vehicle and his body is dismembered. Because he's an Ajin, his body regenerates and is at full health seconds after that. Unfortunately, this regeneration is seen by many witnesses, who report him instantly to the police. Ajin's aren't well received in society because several incidents took place in the past, and are frowned upon. And so the protagonist's escape begins.\\n\\n\r\nSeveral topics, which make the story really deep and interesting, are addressed as he's escaping from the government. First the knowledge about supernatural beings and money. Because Ajin's are immortal, the scientists are able to experiment. Life is endless, thus the torture is endless. There's a point where those \u201ccreatures\u201d go crazy as well and kill people as retaliation. Is that right or \u201cgood\u201d? That question is addressed several times in the anime as they show the captured ones.\\n\\n\r\nAnother topic is the opinion about superhuman beings in society. This is presented with his childhood friend Kaito. Despite being an Ajin, he helps him out and accepts him as he is. Not only does this lead to a more diverse and realistic view of Ajins (not every member of society has the same opinion), but it also leads to an inner conflict in Kei. Especially on the verge of going crazy, he has to think about whether he wants to abandon his \u201chuman\u201d side or stays firm in his will. Another person, that shows him the better side of society, is the senior later on. She accepts him as he is too and appreciates his presence because she's lonely and caring. The two views on Ajins and their resulting impact for the inner conflict is one of the outstanding aspects in Ajin.\\n\\n\r\nBut what would a show be without an \u201cantagonist\u201d? This role is filled by Satou. His target is to reform the world in order to have a place to live (he's an Ajin as well). This is one of the reasons, why the viewer can understand his actions and portrays the opposite approach to the problem as Kei's. He's offering Kei to support his plan, but is rejected for several reasons and their ways part.\\n\\n\r\nThe series supports a small cast. It's another strength of the series. We have our protagonist, who is a cold and logical person, but has inner conflicts with his emotions as well. His family is also shown to support the view of despise for Ajins and shows, how easy relationships can crumble. Kaito is a childhood friend and fills the role of the other possible view and is characterized a bit, but just as his family not further shown later on. On the other hand we have Satou, who is characterized a lot. It makes the viewer question, what really is correct, Kei's or Satou's view. There are some other characters as well, but they either don't progress the story or are underdeveloped.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I can praise the show for a really interesting and deep story, there are some major flaws this show has. One is the plot holes the story has due to an open end. Neither the question, why the Ajin's exist, nor the events of the 13th episode are answered. The story hasn't been fully adapted from the manga, but that doesn't mean that the story can get away with it. They have to either make a second season or answer the questions in the movies. Else this would be just as an open end as your generic ecchi harem anime and just a collection of themes thrown out to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is the split of the story in the last half. Two stories are told from different views (Satou and Kei) and barely overlap. Hence, Kei doesn't get enough screen time to properly develop and push his story forward. In fact, his story stalls for quite some time because of Satou and by the end neither of their problems are resolved.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are another reason to complain. While our protagonist develops himself, it's still not enough. His past and personality isn't graspable and remains in the dark. Also, the friend suddenly vanishes from the story as his family does and leaves the question open, what happened to them. If they were to show even one scene, what they do, I would be satisfied. But that doesn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe last issue is the animation. The CG just looks very ugly and you need time to adapt to this kind of animation. It sometimes fits the scenes and makes them more realistic and impactful, but for most of the time the movement of characters doesn't look smooth. This is one of the reasons the emotions of some characters aren't conveyed properly to the viewer and takes most of the joy to watch the protagonist struggle through the several challenges imposed upon him by being an Ajin. If this is the case, the animation has failed. If they had made the CG just a bit smoother and higher in quality, it would have been a great style fitting to the story. Unfortunately, this didn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the music is great. The opening gives a really creepy and cruel feeling off and fits the series very well. Besides that the background music supports the mood of Ajin and together with the ED really make up for the animation and arouses the desire for more.\\n\\n\r\nAs I pointed out before, the series shows big potential with its underlying themes and makes you yearn for more. It's really unfortunate that the series ends before it even begins to explain the big mysteries it brought up and finishes Kei's problem. One can enjoy or hate the animation, but as for me, it looked rather mediocre and has much potential for rework in order to make it even better. Luckily, the music balances the flaws of the animation out. So I can really recommend giving it a try. Unless you hate the animation, you will find good aspects (whether music or story) as well. If you want to know more behind the mysteries, you have to either read the manga or wait for another season or the movies.",

            "content": "In terms of story, Ajin isn't all that unique when you break it down. Very simply, it is a story about a \"misfit\" in society who is discovered and whose life changes. He tries to live simply and blend in, but various circumstances coax him into becoming involved in a larger picture, in which he acts as one of the saviors of humanity. Like I said, it's not that unique. So, why does it stand out? In my opinion, it's the characters. \r\nAjin is interesting because the main character isn't your run-of-the-mill hero. He's colder, darker, and his motives are centered more around himself thanjustice. He seems to be attached to certain people in his life, but then again he seems psychopathic. This makes his actions less predictable and more interesting to watch throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe concept of ajins is also interesting. Questions like \"where do they come from?\" and \"why are they here?\" and \"what will happen to them and society?\" help drive the anime forward while keeping the interest of viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ajin is a good anime. Not top priority, but if you can get past the animation, give it a try. \\n\\n\r\nI must warn you, though, that the ending is unsatisfactory. It was mostly setting up for the second season (which is already out).",

It's unique, and it accurately depicts how the government and general public would likely react if something 'different' were to be discovered in society. I have you say, don't let yourself get turned off by the off-kilter animation; if you do that, you'll miss out on a truly great story-line and watching experience.\r\nAdmittedly, I went into the anime with an open mind, but was a bit thrown off by the animation, as so many others have been. Despite this, I continued to watch it, and I surprisingly began to get used to it; I even started to enjoy and embracethe weird animation after a certain point, although I can see how it could become distracting for certain viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is, I found Ajin to be a thoroughly enjoyable and realistic anime. I could see it actually happening if something like Ajin really existed. It was pretty awesome, and I liked the characters a lot.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were also really good, and they suited the tone of the anime rather well.",

            "content": "When everyone heard that I liked \"Tokyo Goul\", they told me I should watch Ajin. They praised this anime and I thoght, after reading the plot, they were right. Oh if I only knew how wrong I was....\r\nAs I said, I really liked the plot and the general story of the anime was very good, with it's own unique points. The characters where very interesting and developed quite well for a 13-episode anime. \r\nWhat I didn't like at all, and actually was the reason I rated this anime with a 4, was the art. I can tell 'Polygon Pictures' put a lot of effort tomake something unique, but I think they should know that CG was not the proper style for an anime. There are some very good fighting scenes in the anime but the characters moved in a way that made those scenes look awkward and not containing the action I expected.  \"Ajin\" gave me a very creepy villain, who also participated in those fighting scenes, but the art made both him and the rest of the characters move as if they just woke up and didn't have coffee yet. If it wasn't for their facial expresions and the rare close-ups to the face, I wouldn't be interested in the characters at all, despite the nice background, the interesting reaction and minor development.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season exists in both my computer and in my list, but I highly doubt I'll be watching it any time soon. In short, \"Ajin\" was an anime that needed a different art style in order to complete the relatively nice package it offered.",

The only character who has even been hurt is a likable one.  There are plenty of people to hate, but none of them get anything.  Also, the main character, Kei, is a whiny little bitch whonever does anything.  He just gets pulled along by his friend Kaito and keeps being afraid and asking \"Why is this happening?\" which you might ask once, but seriously he does nothing but feel sorry for himself. He never does anything and just gets fucked by everyone and never fights back.  I guess he's kind of trying to be a pacifist, but it just means Kaito's gonna have to do it, and what if one of these times he dies??  Anyway... if I had to think of something good, well, I guess the fights are cool, when they happen which is rare.  Jeez, I tried to think of something better than that, but I just can't.

            "content": "I'm not one to write reviews, but here it goes\r\nWhen I first saw Ajin, the art and animation really threw me off, because for a 2016 anime, everything it was borderline crap. I originally planned to drop this, but the story hooked me just a bit, and so I pretended it was 2008/2009 naruto and continued on.\r\nThe beginning is pretty cliche. Average teen boy finds out something is wrong with him blah blah blah. Very Tokyo Ghoul like, with all the \"Why me\" and stuff, but the protagonist showed himself to be a little more that what he seems to be on the outside.\r\n NagaiKei is a rather cold, calculating, and unfeeling, and I personally felt like that was a good asset to the story, making his character more intriguing. He isn't the only well written character. Like some of the other comments stated, many of the characters are rather... what's the word... vexing? If I had to describe what I felt about the characters in a word, I would say I was rather ambivalent about all of them, besides maybe one or two. There is some sympathy put into play, but it's quickly washed away by the character's actions later on into the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is pretty good. I finished it satisfied, like every other anime I've watched. It falls into the popular category of dark psychological fantasy stuff that's everyone (Including me) is raving over these days. I wouldn't recommend it if you're one of those people who hate on the trending anime like Tokyo Ghoul or whatever. I'm all for trends, so I can't relate.\\n\\n\r\nSo yea, if you can look past the art, this isn't a bad anime. It's just.... THE ANIMATION. i mean it gets better throughout... or maybe i just got used to the quality, but ugh. i really want to give it an 8.5 or something, but the animation. Just pretend it's an old anime or something i guess.\\n\\n\r\nI know my thoughts are over the place, but I hope you find this review helpful",

In terms of character development, LA would say that Kei hardly develops over the series and just keeps to his own goals as a loner, it's the villains against each other that get more development out of the bulk of the series overall, which makes Kei a rather bland yet smart protagonist but that's all LA can say about him. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot does go into some crazy territory with exponential levels of pacing and the plot twists are rather intriguing especially coming from The Hat. The villains rivalry with each other gives more world building on the Ajin's and the \"dark side of human nature\" said in the premise. The themes present does bring in the entire \"are monsters like the Ajin the REAL monsters\" and although it's portrayed quite well through the main cast, it is a slow burn to get to the point.\\n\\n\r\nLA's favourite character would be Tosaki's assistant Izumi Shimomura voiced by ''Mikako Komatsu''. \\n\\n\r\nNow the animation by Polygon Pictures, LA KNOWS they do consistent work with their all-over 3D CGI from the characters to it's monster designs very much the same from ''Sidionia no Kishi'' to ''Arpeggio of Blue Steel'' and if LA compares it to that, it's...\"ok\" at best, it's not Polygon Pictures best 3D CGI animated show as the backgrounding is taken slightly slack though it's compensated with the huge battle pieces which are the best parts of the anime, but it's not as great animation from ''Arpeggio of Blue Steel''.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending if anything gave Kei an \"11th Hour Superpower\" that leads into an ending with more questions than answers, yes we get that kind of ending however considering that this anime has 3 movies, 2 which have yet to be released, LA can kinda see why this was the ending they went for. \\n\\n\r\nAjin is an anime focused more on it's life or death themes along with the nature of humanity and world building of the Ajin's in general more than the characters themselves and although it's pacing can get exponentially crazier than the more you look into it especially with it's battle set pieces. \\n\\n\r\nAjin, you may have 3D CGI as a problem to the masses and was largely unnoticed of Winter 2016 because of it, but you might have some other problems to deal with, this anime isn't outright terrible as it definitely have some of it's high points from the villains and their plans, world building and battles, but even the small flaws are flaws Ajin, just like the weakness' of the Ajin itself.",

            "content": "Haven\u2019t had reviews in a while, so bear with me.\r\nBefore reading further, please be warned that these may contain spoilers. I\u2019ll try to lessen as much as I could.\r\nAjin: Demi-Human, or simply \u201cAjin,\u201d is the story of Kei Nagai, a seemingly normal high school boy who discovers he is an Ajin, a mysterious life form deemed to be powerful and immortal. As his existence is publicized, certain people and organizations took an interest in him, all of which has plans to use him and his abilities for their own purpose.\r\nTokyo Ghoul would be the first thing to pop inside your head by readingAjin\u2019s synopsis. With a great number of similarities, it\u2019s not uncommon for a comparison. That way, people could get to weigh which is better, or build their own standard. I\u2019ll try my best not to compare for the purpose of having Ajin an unbiased assessment.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (4/10)\\n\r\nThere really isn\u2019t much to it. It took a hasty pace as it started, rushing to the discovery of Kei being an Ajin. Then it kind of slowed down as it progressed. \\n\\n\r\nConflicts are thrown out here and there, hoping to give the viewers a possible outcome inside their head on what would happen next. Yes, you may anticipate, but it\u2019ll ultimately just be useless. Often, holes were left open and eventually untouched, even when you\u2019re expecting the next episode should have covered it somehow. That is the thing that Ajin mostly lacked: a resolve. There are times that a cliffhanger isn\u2019t effective.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (7/10)\\n\r\nThe animation is a breath of fresh air actually. Polygon Pictures took a risk of animating with 3DCG. But unlike Boku dake ga Inai Machi and Dimension W, which clearly offered smooth and great animation, Ajin can be (rather, was) easily set aside. Although the animation itself was good in its own way, there were cases that it was unsettling and had your eyes barely on the screen.\\n\\n\r\nContrary to its style though, the ending animation was quite appealing. It was minimalistic, yet reflective enough to captivate a viewer, unlike its opening that featured mostly excerpts from the whole show itself. Lazy, I may say, but it did shine its own light.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10)\\n\r\nUsually, even a bad anime can be remembered with a great soundtrack. Take that away and you\u2019re left with only the black cookie part of a cheap knock-off of an Oreo. Ajin clearly has put on the table an opening and an ending that fitted perfectly with the Kei\u2019s struggle. By estimation, I\u2019d say that 89% of people who gives an eff to an anime\u2019s OP and ED would sing along to the \u2018Yeah\u2019 part of Flumpool\u2019s \u201cYoru wa Nemureru Kai?\u201d and have a soulful connection with Mamoru Miyano\u2019s voice in \u201cHow Close You Are.\u201d Furthermore, the background music and other special effects gave Ajin a fighting chance soundtrack-wise. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (2/10)\\n\r\nThe goals of the anime were all crushed and beat down by a crappy set of characters. And like what I\u2019ve said, Ajin completely lacked the concept of a resolve. New characters are introduced here and there, shining a light on a possible great turnaround, went into a tragic mess of list of characters that may already be regarded as dead. \\n\\n\r\nIt had a set of characters who pretty much contradict each other\u2019s ideas, all resulting to a lot of disagreement and eventually flamed more war. \\n\\n\r\nThere were characters that deserved to be significant in the series, but were just set aside, and ended like they never really were a part of it.\\n\\n\r\nIzumi Shimomura had the potential of a likeable character. She was kind, amiable, compassionate, and sensitive. Unlike the main character. A major turn off from her is her total uncertainty and an innocent ignorance.\\n\\n\r\nIt also didn\u2019t focus too much on Kei, considering he wasn\u2019t really a likeable character to begin with. Who was once a reserved, goal-oriented, caring guy, had become this bland type of a main character that is messed up, undecided, and thinks in utter disorder. Okay, so we\u2019ll have the whole Ajin thing accountable for it. But, take Kaneki Ken (from Tokyo Ghoul). At least he had an objective. (Score 1 for Tokyo Ghoul. Sorry.)\\n\\n\r\nOh, and \u201cKaito who?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (7/10)\\n\r\nAjin promised great action. The visuals took advantage of the 3DCG and benefitted from it entirely, providing a thorough and remarkable stunning fight (and encounter) scenes that glue you to your seat and watch what happens next. Expect greatness here, action-wise.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, although minimal, it still had flaws that it would have been prevented easily.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (5.8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI really feel that the main problem of this anime is backstory. It shouldn\u2019t have focused too much on quickly starting a war itself, rather, to show and carefully build tension. Although it did end on the edge of a cliff (literally), I still am curious as to how Kei would face the real antagonist. I might take a shot on watching its movie counterpart and sequels to grasp more from it. Until then, this would be one of those animes that would be pulled out from your favourite list.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, although it consistently begged even from it itself, Ajin: Demi-Human did fulfill their end of the bargain. \\n",
