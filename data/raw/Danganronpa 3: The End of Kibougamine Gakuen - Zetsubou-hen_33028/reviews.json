            "content": "(Spoilers for the Danganronpa games) As half of the Danganronpa 3 anime experience, Side Despair's purpose is to provide backstory for Side Future as well as fill in Super Danganronpa 2's blanks. Neither should should be watched without playing the first two games in the series, but with Despair's final episode over with I can in good conscience say that they shouldn't be watched at all.\r\nSide Despair's problem is that it's boring, safe, predictable, and pointless. As a companion piece to Side Future it does its job fairly well, but in every other regard it's an absolute failure. Danganronpa and Super Danganronpa 2 left severalquestions unanswered, mysteries left up to one's interpretation. DR3 Side Despair aims to solve these riddles and provide answers to what exactly happened to Class 77 before SDR2's events.\\n\\n\r\nThis was a terrible idea.\\n\\n\r\nClass 77's backstory is largely shoved to the background in favour of crossovers with Side Future and an insider's view of series antagonist Junko Enoshima's infernal machinations. When the time finally comes for their big defining moment, none of them have had the development to warrant it. Instead, aside from outliers Nagito Komaeda, Chiaki Nanami, Ryota Mitarai and the Ultimate Impostor, all of them are mushed into one entity. Class 77 is no longer a cast of different characters, but one singular plot device the series has been chained to. Most of the Class 77 segments is spent building up to the demise of the one student missing in SDR2, and when it finally hits it's neither impactful nor entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nJunko Enoshima herself has also lost all of her charm. In the games, she appeared only at the very end of DR1 and SDR2. Now she's a main character in Side Despair, and it really hammers home the point that she's best used sparingly. In short, she's just not a very interesting character when you get down to it. She's evil because she's evil, and every single one of her evil plans always goes off without a hitch. What she ends up doing to plunge the world into despair is also incredibly stupid and hokey. The charismatic supervillain who capped off both games on their victory laps is now an omnipresent, transparently evil mwahahaer with little to do or say except ensure that all of SDR2's major backstory beats are hit. The one shining beacon of hope is one of the new anime-original guys, Juzo Sakakura, an excellently written character with a compelling and tragic arc. However, most of his big moments happen in Side Future, though vital setup occurs in Side Despair. Juzo is one of the best additions to the series yet, and his presence alone saves the show from being scored even lower.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I liked SDR2 better when I didn't actually know what happened before it. Every answer we get in Side Despair is far lamer than what I'd envisioned, and just about every character is cheapened by the Persona 4-esque herd treatment. Just about the only character who escaped mostly unscathed was Komaeda, and even he, who was THE defining driving force of SDR2, ended up underutilised and mostly there to provide context for Side Future's events. This show not only fails on its own, but it serves to also make SDR2 a much weaker story once you know just how uninteresting its backstory is.\\n\\n\r\nSide Despair is woefully written and dreadfully directed. The animation is also clearly low budget, with the excellent music and voice work, as usual for the franchise, being its only saving graces. You probably already watched this if you're a hardcore fan of the series, but I recommend everyone else give this a skip. Side Future is undoubtedly the stronger show of the two, though even then it'd hard to recommend that one either.",

            "content": "As a major fan of this series, I was expecting this anime to conclude the story for the three games and this arc was a surprise to many as we got a prequel of the second game to explain many mysteries involving the characters and the entire plot for the rest of the games. \r\nSadly, there's a huge problem when, instead of giving you answers or even more questions, this anime leaves you with contradictions about what you already experienced in the games. \r\nDanganronpa 3: The end of Hope's Peak Academy - Despair Side falls into this situation repeatedly. The selling point of this workis, as shown in their PV, the evolution of the 77th class into despair. They're barely present in the series. Barely. And they were the selling point. \\n\\n\r\nThe development about the characters we all knew and love is null, there's nothing to add into what the games already showed us and at points it contradicts what you have done in the games. \\n\r\nThe pace of the writing is wonky at best, with jumps in time that aren't explained of make sense in the huge timeline of the franchise, there's fanservice just to cover up the huge plotholes this anime leaves and it doesn't feel like it's a gift for the fans who have played this game for more than 4 years. \\n\\n\r\nJust as an example: The final scene from this anime in the credits contradicts the very five minutes you play into SDR2. And that isn't supposed to happen if you're going for a ground-breaking project like this and expect to make people who are already more than familiar with the story be angry or nitpicky because of the poor attention to detail. \\n\\n\r\nThe few things that save this anime is the music, which is very nice in both Op/End and their OST, the voice acting which is top notch and the appearance of the Despair Twins and their dynamics and also the dynamics between the Future Foundation main Trio. \\n\r\nThe protagonist and focus of this arc is weak, the introduction of a fan favourite to turn her into the mere shadow she was in the games for a plot device is simply insulting and her classmates are barely in there. Other than Impostor and Health Committee member, no one else gets development in a refreshing way or have any weight in the plot. \\n\\n\r\nAs an advice I recommend to not be hype about this anime if you're a die hard fan of the series or do it as me: Play the three games in a row, then sit to watch this; because you'll notice all the plotholes and contradictions and you'll be more focused into that than the entire story they poorly presented. \\n\\n",

            "content": "\"This is a tale of hope that ends in despair\"\r\nThese are the words that were spoken in the very beginning of this entry. A tale about the bright and talented students of Hopes Peak Academy's 77th Class. This entry explains what happened to SDR2's cast and everything about the Biggest, Most Atrocious Despair-Inducing Incident in Human History. A great prequel to the Danganronpa series.\r\nIf you're interested in watching this, you have to go back to the start of this series as this is the third entry from this series and watching this without knowledge of prior entries will confuse you and you wont get thefull enjoyment out of this entry, not to mention it will also spoil the events of SDR1 and 2. If you have knowledge then the watch order would be episode 1 of Side:Future, then episode 1 of Side:Despair and continue that pattern with the finale being Side:Hope. Remember, this review will contain minor and major spoilers of SDR1 and 2, you have been warned.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with the 77th Class of Hopes Peak Academy and re-introduces them to us, it starts off fairly light and there's lots of comedic moments you can enjoy with your favorite characters from SDR2 while it foreshadows future events that you already know of. The story elegantly ties in with Side:Future as it gives us backstories of the cast from Side:Future as well. I thought every detail was explained well and even if certain things weren't explained at all, it still happened without visual presentation. I wont call it a plot hole as this is not the case. Unfortunately the show loves to go either with a slow pace or a very fast pace which is a minor setback. There were lots of controversies on how the 77th Class (and reserve course) fell into despair but I found it was the only reasonable explanation. So in conclusion I thought it explained the Biggest, Most Atrocious Despair-Inducing Incident in Human History quite well and we saw how everything happened, the first killing game was handled brilliantly, the events leading up to the major ones was done great. All in all the story tied in every entry in this series.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first episode we are introduced to a certain likable character from SDR2 and many were surprised about it because of the events of SDR2. This character is Chiaki Nanami and she's a bit different from SDR2, certain traits were kept but a few things were different about this character which makes sense if you know the whole story about her. Here this character is more perfect than the game version, but more human than in the game which is ironic since she was an AI. All the other characters are the same but the designs are slightly different, but they are all still excellent. We also get to see how Junko plays with Hopes Peak Academy and how she did everything, it's quite nice to see her in action as it really gives me more feeling to her character. Mukuro and Izuru are also present and you can see the love the former has for Junko and despair while the latter is a great written character who is quite tragic in my eyes. I will cover Side:Future's characters in Side:Future's review.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't anything amazing or mind-blowing nor is the animation, it's well done, but nothing overly bad or overly good, there were some scenes which were really well done in the animation and art department but other than that it wasn't anything special.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 6\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is simply amazing, as per usual in the Danganronpa franchise, they played the right tracks at the right time and it was just amazing. The voice acting was high tier as well, how can the voice acting go wrong when you have that many talented actors for the characters? (Ah ultimate students get ultimate actors)\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nBeing a Danganronpa fan, this has obviously been a blast to me, there were one or two boring parts but other than that it was one hell of a ride and I wouldn't mind re-watching this in the years to come, it showed me scenes that I really wanted to see ever since the games told me about them and I'm very satisfied about this series.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show does have a few faults, I still think it was really good, a great anime that I recommend to any fan of the Danganronpa franchise, it's a must watch and I'll remember this one for a while just like the previous entries in this franchise.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------",

            "content": "First things first. You need the play the two DR games (DR 1, SDR2) to fully understand and enjoy the two DR3 anime. If you were a fan of the first installment of the Danganronpa anime, you'll love the games, so please, if you haven't so already, turn around and play those two games (or watch a walkthrough) for the best viewing possible. DR: Another Episode is also mandatory especially for Future arc. Also be sure to watch both Future and Despair arc in broadcast order (i.e. watch future arc ep 1 then watch despair arc ep 1, and so on). There are parts wherethe story and characters might overlap, so be sure to watch it like that for better understanding.\\n\\n\r\nDR3: Despair arc is essentially a prologue to the DR story. It centers around the 77th class of the Hope's Peak acadmey, who btw are the main cast of the 2nd game: SDR2. The setting, once so happy and carefree, turns into one of the darkest points in their history: a prologue to the Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic event in human history. As the title and premise says, don't expect a happy ending to this. Although it starts off like your typical slice of life school anime, there is a brooding tone that constantly evolves as the episodes contiunously progress, awaiting to become a monster that destroys the students daily lives with despair. This tone starts as lighthearted then transitions into a darker mood, eventually becoming something outright disturbing. Suddenly, the happy, slice of life school setting is no more, instead it becomes violent, bloody and despair-inducing.\\n\r\nOne thing I liked is that they didn't linger or focus too much into the events the game already touched to an extent, like the Twilight Syndrome case. Just showing things in Hajime's point of view, and that was the better thing to do for the series.\\n\r\nOne thing I would've liked was to see the 78th class just a bit more than a cameo, like their original interactions with Junko, but with the anime being just 1 cour, it's understandable that they had to leave that out. \\n\r\nA disappointing isssue was that he pacing is a noticeably off. I feel like 11 episodes for the 77th class wasn't enough in the end. If it could have gotten a little bit more time, and cut a little bit more of the fanservice, I think the whole tragedy and the aftermaths could have been done better.\\n\r\n(SPOILERS: For example, the scene of \"her\" death and the 77 class turning into despair could have used an in-between scene. Maybe one that goes more in-depth of how the class fully submitted to Junko. The skip between the death scene and the finale was too sudden, considering the two were a couple months apart.)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the characters are really fun to watch as a fan. Just seeing all those characters I loved so much from the 2nd game animated is just so exciting. I felt that one good touch was that as episodes progress and tends to get darker, the art itself progresses to a more darker mood along with the story. Even the opening changes during the middle, to a much more darker color. It was a very nice touch to have, considering what was coming. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP/ED is pretty good, and the soundtracks were decent, although it could've been better. One thing I did like is how they used some game soundtracks for good nostalgia. The voice acting is fantastic as usual though, just like the games. The voices fit so well with the characters, which always helps the experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important part of the despair arc (and the rest of the danganronpa series in general) are without a doubt the characters. If I didn't care for the characters, I would never have felt anything for them and thus I probably wouldn't have cared what happened to them. Now, since the most of the cast were fleshed out pretty well in SDR2, it wasn't that hard to make me like them from the get go. However, one thing I would've liked to see is just making the cast even stronger. I know that Chiaki, Hinata, and Nagito are indeed the important characters, but I also would've liked those without too much game time from SDR2 to get a bit more exposure and development, like Teruteru and Mahiru to an extent. What I'm glad though, is the screen time the Ultimate Imposter got. Anyways, even if some characters are not getting the desirable screen time, they are still enjoyable to watch. This is also an important reason to play the games before watching this. You just get to know the characters better and smile as they are finally interacting cheerfully without being forced to kill each other. And of course, feel a lot more sadness when they are forced to go through \"that process\". However, one thing that I am really glad Despair arc managed was Mukuro and Junko getting a bit more depth, as well as Mitarai.\\n\r\nOne thing I didn't really like though, was how it put focus on the future arc characters for a couple of episodes, halting potential DR0 scenes and even halting the depth of the characters and their downfall. It's a shame that the despair process did not go as I imagined thanks to this, as I would've preferred the \"despairification\" process to be on a more personal level. Having more than 11 episodes would have helped.\\n\\n\r\nAs a huge fan of the danganronpa series, I feel both love and disappointment with the DR 3. On one hand, I loved seeing the characters I loved so much animated, interacting with each other. Even the first two episodes which were basically fan service was enjoyable to watch. Although honestly, they could have made the slice-of-life moments shorter just so we could've had more plot development earlier on. And on the other hand there were pacing issues, like I've mentioned. Also, the despair arc is also a big 'what could have been'. What if they would have personalized the despairification process? I think that would have been a better way to showcase and further the depth of both the characters and how they became \"despair\". Nonetheless, I had this huge smile while watching the first couple of episodes, only for it to turn to sadness and eventually into complete anxiousness as I knew what would eventually happen to the cast. It could have been much better, in fact, after rewatchign the series a couple of times, I just feel disappointed in how the revelation of how the 77th class turned into despair. It's still a fine watch.\\n\r\nGive the entire series (games + anime) a try! It's definitely worth your time.",

            "content": "As Danganronpa fans, we only get to hear stories about the high-school life of the characters and how \u201cThe Tragedy\u201d happened, but we never actually get to see that. But with Danganronpa 3 \u2013 Zetsubou-hen, we get just that. Zetsubou-hen takes place prior to the events of the first Danganronpa game, primarily focusing on 77th class of the main course and their story about how they became the \u201cRemnants of Despair\u201d. Labeled as a story that begins with hope but ends in despair, it definitely won\u2019t have a happy end. But this is a treat for Danganronpa fans as they get the happy moments oftheir favorite character, until all hell breaks loose. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nDespite being titled as Danganronpa 3, it is actually a prequel to the first game. However, it is meant to be watched after playing the second game as it spoils the plot twists of Danganronpa 2. Being a prequel however, you will already what will happen and how it\u2019ll end. But the sole purpose of this anime is to show you how it happened. The story focuses on the 77th class (the main cast of Danganronpa 2) and their life at Hope's Peak Academy. But the story focuses on our Danganronpa 2 protagonist, Hinata Hajime, and how he tries to find himself a talent. The story also focuses on the new characters that were introduced in Mirai-hen and give more background for them. And as you\u2019ve probably predicted, it doesn\u2019t take too long for Despair to appear with Enoshima creating the \u201cRemnant of Despair\u201d and \u201cKamukura Izuru Project\u201d taking place. Overall, the story is handle very well and it remain \u201calmost\u201d consistent with what we\u2019ve heard before about \u201cThe Tragedy\u201d. The reason why I say \u201calmost\u201d is because there are some things Monokuma/Enoshima told us before that don\u2019t quite happen in Zetsubou-hen. But then again, they were Enoshima\u2019s words\u2026 you can\u2019t really trust that, can you? \\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nZetsubou-hen is the Danganronpa you know and love. It starts off in a happy tone, similar to the fun moments for the second game. But then despair kicks in, which is to be expected from anything Danganronpa related. One thing that is well-done in Zetsubou-hen is how the writers manage to remember so many tiny details mentioned in the second game and apply them to this anime. Remember Tanaka saying something about defeating a giant Pomeranian in his. If you don\u2019t remember, don\u2019t worry\u2026 the writers haven\u2019t forgotten. And they also applied Saionji\u2019s height change later in the series too. The first couple of episodes of the series is basically fanservice for the fan base. We get to see the Danganronpa 2 characters we know with their unique personalities being shown. We get to see the happy moments of the 77th class before \u201cthings\u201d happened. But the rest of the series is what fans expect from this prequel story; despair. The series has the same wacky and zany, yet dark and disturbing tone of its predecessors. The pacing can be a bit too fast as times, but that was to be expected with the amount of plot points that needed to be covered.\\n\r\nPresentation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nZetsubou-hen primarily focuses on the 77th Class and Hinata Hajime prior to becoming the \u201cRemnant of Despair\u201d. The characterization for these characters are very similar to their characterization in the second game. Hinata\u2019s still kind of cynical, Nanami\u2019s still adorable, Komaeda\u2019s still kibou-sexual, Tanaka\u2019s still a chuunibyou, Souda\u2019s still pathetic, Mioda\u2019s still loud, Nidai still needs to take a dump, Saionji\u2019s still a b*tch, and so on. Zetsubou-hen is very loyal with its characters and keeps them as how they\u2019re supposed to be. But out of these characters, Hinata, Nanami and Komaeda are the ones that play a bigger role, while the rest are mostly there as comic relief or just for the sake of the plot. Hinata\u2019s inferiority complex kicks in right when we get introduced to him and his accepting the Kamukura Project plays a big role in the series. His complexity is well handled when he\u2019s Hinata. When he\u2019s Kamukura, his more of a flat character, but that\u2019s how his character ends up being. Nanami, who\u2019s appearance was quite surprising since she was known to be simply an A.I. in the second game, plays a big role in this series too. And she ends up being the most unpredictable character since you actually don\u2019t know how things will end up for her. Komaeda is here quite a lot, though it may not always be for the sake of moving the plot, but because we get to see more of his ultimate ability, Ultimate Asspuller\u2026 I mean Ultimate Lucky Student. But Enoshima Junko\u2019s also a major character in the series, but that is too be expected since she is the conflict of the series. Zetsubou-hen also builds up on its Mirai-hen characters, like Yukizome and Munakata, and it\u2019s done pretty effectively. For that sole reason, it is meant to watch together with Mirai-hen.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe art in Zetsubou-hen is pretty good, but it\u2019s the art style that succeeds more. The art is fairly well detailed and the backgrounds are fairly well done. But the character designs are the most impressive. The characters in Danganronpa 2 all had quite unique character desings, and that same uniqueness can be found here. Some characters look slightly different, like how Tanaka\u2019s hair style is different. But the most notable thing is that the art style is very vivid, especially when compared to the franchise. This creates a contrast to Mirai-hen\u2019s darker-than-normal art style. This vivid art style might have been used to represent the hopefulness the series initially started with and this art style might\u2019ve been used as a contrast for the darker despair moments that comes later in the series. Overall, it was a pretty smart choice to go with an art style that contrast with Mirai-hen\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animations are fairly good in the series, but it isn\u2019t anything extraordinary. However, that is to say that the animation quality is fairly consistent throughout. Generally speaking, the animation is fluid enough and there aren\u2019t any noticeable animation quality drops. Backgrounds feel a little static though. However, the lighting helps in adding more volume to the visuals. Though if we compare the animation quality to Mirai-hen\u2019s it is a little weaker. But unlike Mirai-hen (which is more action-heavy), Zetsubou-hen doesn\u2019t have any demanding moments that needs high-quality animations. Lerche did a good job in animating two seasons during the same time, which they aren\u2019t used too. \\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast is the same as the games and Mirai-hen. All the well-known seiyuu are back to represent their character. Takayama Minami does the Danganronpa 2 protagonist, Hinata Hajime, and does him and his alternate personality, Kamukura Izuru, perfectly well. Ogata Megumi (the same seiyuu as Naegi Makoto), does Komaeda Nagito again, and she does his voice amazingly well. Just like Danganronpa 2, Ogata has time to shine and show her talent as a character like Komaeda. Hanazawa Kana reprises her role as Nanami Chiaki and does her character very well. Unlike her A.I. personality in Danganronpa 2, Nanami sounds a little less listless, but it matches her character more. Toyoguchi Megumi does both the Despair sisters, Enoshima Junko and Ikusaba Mukuro, and she does a great job with both, but her talent shines with Junko more. Nakahara Mai does a very good job as Yukizome Chisa. Her character didn\u2019t play a big role in Mirai-hen, but in Zetsubou-hen, she\u2019s one of the main characters. And other seiyuu such as Sugita Tomokazu, Kayano Ai, and Fukuyama Jun all do a great job with their characters. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nOne of Danganronpa\u2019s strong point is its music and Zetsubou-hen is no different. The OP, \u201cKami-iro Awase\u201d, didn\u2019t take too long to become one of my favorite anime openings. The music, the vocals, and the lyrics are amazing for the song. And there\u2019s a lot of symbolism in the song too. The ED, \u201cZettai Kibou Birthday\u201d, is sung by Komaeda\u2019s seiyuu and it\u2019s very good. The vocals and music are nice and it matches the tone of the hope in the series. The lyrics is quite weird\u2026 but so is Komaeda! Most of the background music consists of music used in the first two games, which is a good thing since the two games had some amazing music. The background music creates a sense of nostalgia due to its familiarity. Till this day, the closing argument theme is my favorite OST and every time I hear it, I always get a sense of joy from it! \\n\r\nMusic: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nAs a Danganronpa fan, this is exactly what I wanted out of Zetsubou-hen. It felt really nice to see the Danganronpa 2 characters again and see how their past was. As someone who always wanted to see how everything turned out the way it ended up to be, I was really satisfied that we were able to see that with this anime adaptation. This anime covers \u201cThe Kamukura Izuru Project\u201d, \u201cTwilight Syndrome Murder Case\u201d (albeit a little rushed), \u201cStudent Council Massacre\u201d, how the \u201cRemnant of Despair\u201d were created, and \u201cThe Tragedy\u201d. Though my rating for enjoyment is high, it\u2019s really hard to enjoy a series like this. You\u2019ll mostly just get despair from this series and a whole lot of tragedies. But Zetsubou-hen manages to keep my attention all of the time. Zetsubou-hen and Mirai-hen are easily one of the most enjoyable things I have watched this year. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Zetsubou-hen is definitely worth watching if you\u2019re a Danganronpa fan (though you probably already have).  Due remember though that Zetsubou-hen, despite it being a prequel chronologically wise, is meant to be watched after playing the first two game. Due note that you must play the second game in order to fully appreciate both Zetsubou-hen and Mirai-hen. Danganronpa\u2019s first game or its lackluster adaptation isn\u2019t enough. But with great handling of its characters, and satisfying adaptations of stories we were only told about in the previous games, Zetsubou-hen manages to be the perfect treat for fans. It may not be an easy watch due to depressing moments, but it manages to keep your attention. But that is to be expected since the it\u2019s a story that begins in hope and ends in despair.\\n\\n\r\n+ Great prequel anime for the Danganronpa series, that adapts many key plot-points that were mentioned in the games. \\n\r\n+ Danganronpa 2 characters are handled well and loyal to the second game.\\n\r\n+ Great OPs and EDs and the background music is the same as the games.\\n\r\n+ Not only develops its Danganronpa 2 characters, but also the characters from Mirai-hen too. \\n\r\n+ Lots of fun and satisfying moments for fans of the franchise. \\n\r\n- Pacing can get a tad bit too fast at times. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.0/10",

            "content": "*Spoilers ahead*\r\nNow this.. How should i put it... This is by far one of the worst anime i've ever watched. certainly in my top 10 worst list. The only things it has going for it is how it reveals a few very minor details, how well it worked along with the other arc, and that the visuals aren't too bad (They aren't even close to being good though). \r\nNow let's go through what makes this (and every other anime), and then sum up what we have. \r\n1-The plot. It is horrendous. I understand that it was set and there wasn't much room to work withit, but it still doesn't change the fact its bad. The internal logic falls apart quite often. Plot holes are absolutely everywhere. Plot convenience tools are used left and right. There was a story to tell somewhere in there, and it could have been interesting, but instead, it was just a rush job with only the final outcome in mind, and it ended up developing in the most boring, predictable and cliche way as possible.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we've got an introduction to our class of gifted individuals, yet it was extremely rushed and thus completely redundant - the fans of the game already know the characters well, and a new audience wouldn't have gotten much from such a tiny introduction. Another reason it was redundant is because... Well, its nothing new is it? I mean every second school anime has that in abundance, and that's not the point of the anime as well, so why waste time on it?\\n\\n\r\nNow for the character and their interaction with the story. The story IS the interaction of the characters with it. Yet, in this story, most of the characters where completely isolated from the story (You could say only Junko had a role in the whole anime), and everyone who did have a chance to do something or interact in any other way, was either a bystander, or had such a level of incompetence, that even a sock puppet would seem like a rich character next to him. You could pretty much replace every line of dialogue in the anime except Junko's with \"it can't be helped\" and not much would change. The saddest thing about it, is how the anime is trying to keep the story seem important, dark, and meaningful, by constantly jamming in death, and rubbing it in the viewer's face.\\n\\n\r\nThe art. Its ok, BUT, the level of detalization of characters was greatly diminished compared to the game, in some cases leaving characters almost unrecognizable. The sound is ok too, bot bad but nothing special as well. \\n\r\nSo, what do we have left? Well, nothing really. While i don't really believe in spoilers in the first place, the end of this one was spoiled to begin with, so while nothing else, i expected that to lower the score this anime gets further. I was rather surprised to see it got such a high rating instead. \\n\\n\r\nWell, now that you know my analysis of this.. Thing... And my opinion on it, feel free to agree or disagree, but please, don't give me baseless arguments and claims such as \"you're wrong cuz that's your opinion only\", or \"You're just hating\". I always analyze anime objectively by comparing it to others as well as consulting my knowledge of movie making and story writing that i got from filming school. Such accusations will simply be ignored due to their illogical nature - i found the other arc ok, and the adaptation of DR1 pretty decent after all.",

            "content": "Danganronpa 3 Despair has become divisive among the fanbase.  From expectations not being fulfilled to false advertising, a good portion of fans we're not satisfied with how the anime was handled.  On the other side of the spectrum, others believe it to be a great work that holds the franchise well.  Lastly, there are those in the middle that still enjoyed it but recognize it's flaws.  I'm also in the middle.  While I did enjoy this series, I also had many issues with it.\r\nFirst off, knowledge of both DR: Trigger Happy Havoc and Super DR2:  Goodbye Island of Despairare necessary.  Even going into this prequel, spoilers are abound right off the bat due to revelations as early as episode 1 spoil critical mysteries you won't find answers to until near the end of the game.  Also, Despair arc runs alongside Future arc, and episode order is one Future arc episode then Despair arc, watching both series simultaneously.  This issue should be brought up as soon as possible, as all the criticism of the anime stems from this format.\\n\\n\r\nThe false advertising I mentioned earlier is that while Despair arc's premise is about the 77th class of Hope's Peak Academy.  The POV starts and gives plenty of focus on a character from the Future arc, Chisa Yukizome.  While she first appears to bring the class together and bonding with them, the story shifts to her investigation about the hidden secrets of the school to the point it takes away time from the 77th class.  That's not all.  Other characters from the Future arc appear later, and get an amount of focus in relation to what's going on in the Future arc at the time.  The fact that no characters from Future arc were even hinted before in promotion materials to be in Despair arc led to the accusations of false advertisement and how Despair arc was used to provide more characterization to the characters from the Future arc that itself couldn't provide.  Two one cour series with each having many characters to focus on rarely gives consistent and equal characterization, and a good number of them will get be sidelined.  And while the attempt is creative, was it worth all the cutting corners in the narrative to fit these plotlines together.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the main characters, the 77th class, get relegated to being side characters in what was supposed to be their own story and get treated more as a collective than individuals.  Some exceptions are Hajime, Chiaki, Nagito and the Super High School Level Imposter, though very slightly, and for specific plot reasons.  Hajime has a adequate amount of characterization because a good deal of focus is on him in the beginning, but it only lasts a few episodes.  Those who played the game know the inevitable change that will befall him, and how he will be erased to make another character take his place for the rest of the series Izuru Kamukura.  This had fans hyped because of who this character was and that we would finally see him in action, but then grew dissatisfied as episodes passed and he rarely did anything.  Hajime who was an interesting character is replaced by Izuru who fans were hyped about, hoping he would play a big role, yet he merely serves as a walking plot device with no character.\\n\\n\r\nChiaki plays a key role that ultimately leads to one of the most divisive episodes of the anime.  The premise of the show is about the 77th class, and how they would later become a group Super High School Level Despair that destroy the world.  There were expectations built up from the second game on how the main antagonist Junko Enoshima managed to turn these beacons of hope into envoys of despair.  The way it was executed left much to be desired, and it's in part due to the existence of another character from the Future arc,  Ryota Mitarai.   This one character is so deeply entrenched in both storylines that many of the decisions for DR3 as a whole was based around him, making him a divisive character.  Chiaki was meant to play the role of the hope of the 77th class, and in order to turn the rest of the 77th class to despair, she was doomed to die.  Ryota was to provide the means to help the transformation, a brainwashing anime.  The characterization of the Super High School Level Imposter is also mainly dependent on this character as well, forming a give and take relationship with him that later becomes friendship.\\n\\n\r\n77th class as a whole already got relegated to being side characters in their own series that their characters as individuals were already diminished, but now the way they're converted, what's supposed to be the focal point of the series, is the same lazy way as a group like some kind of hive mind.   Those who played the games know they aren't just a class of students.  We know they have their own backstories, characteristics (not just the ones used for comedy), and ambitions that made them each who they are.  To have that all tossed aside and have them be treated as a single entity is disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the format is a huge factor, but also, the way it was executed and how it fits in the narrative have problems.  I mentioned before that viewers need to know the storylines of both games before watching.  That could not be anymore true.  You could not hope to understand even half of what goes on in this series without that knowledge, and even then you have to stretch your imagination on how things progress and how it connects to the games.\\n\\n\r\nImportant events are also condensed to one episode, incidents with enough material that could have been made each into their own series.  One example is one of the most brutal events in the series, the first killing game.  If the purpose was to freak the audience out, it succeeded.   However, once you calm down and start evaluating what happened,  you realize that what happened didn't make any sense.  The 16 students weren't captured; they were summoned.  Even when threatened that if they didn't play they would die, the threat diminishes when the ones doing the threatening leave the room.  Junko gives them all sorts of weapons, and only one of the students suggest using them against their coercers, and he promptly gets killed soon after by another of his fellow classmates.  After that, mostly everyone just degrades and start becoming sadistic killers for no reason other than to hammer in the nightmare fuel.  They weren't locked in, had options outside of killing each other, and were left with means that could have just as easily been used to defend themselves and escape rather than turn on each other, but because this must end in tragedy and in such a short time span, the characters have to move the story along no matter what.  In the same vein, afterwards, the school just covers it up, because the board of directors are generic one-dimensional scumbags and Junko can't be caught yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe same line of thought goes into Junko's motivations.  Why did she particular choose the 77th class to begin with?  You never get an answer other then her just being fickle about it.  How did she notice Ryota provided the means for her agenda?  She just had a feeling.  You always get a half-baked answer or no answer at all.  Being a prequel means the main plot points are all foregone conclusions.  However, this point is taken to nauseously exploitative handling.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Mikan goes missing after being captured by Mukuro and has been brainwashed.  The other classmates split up and go search for her even with riots going on outside.  Nagito and Chiaki find the secret room Junko had Ryota held up in by Nagito using his luck, in which has them meeting Izuru and Junko as well, Ryota escaping and running into Chisa, Nagito getting injured and Chisa intervening.  Mukuro was being kept occupied by Peko who Nagito requested she distract her.  How he knows about Mukuro or anything that's been going on with Junko is left unanswered.  Chisa volunteers to stay behind for no good reason, and that leads to Chiaki to carry Nagito back to their classroom where everyone else is, excluding Peko.\\n\\n\r\nNext, Chiaki comes up with the brilliant idea of everyone going together to save Chisa to which they all inevitably agree.  During which Mikan who was missing suddenly returns with Peko who got injured.  You expect since she was the reason everyone was searching for initially, they would ask where she's been and why she's been absent.  No, they don't inquire anything about that. They head towards Chisa who has now been captured and brainwashed.\\n\\n\r\nOn the way, they encounter rioters just outside the gate that is now open for some reason, and there is no security around.  It takes a very special kind of lazy to have this, because in previous scenes, the gates were closed, guards were struggling keeping them out, and you get atleast two scenes of that.  Now, no one is there except the rioters and not only that, they immediately resort to cold-blooded murder.  They were angry before, but here, they are calm, quiet and slowly walk up to Chiaki and everyone.  Nekomaru and Gundham stay behind to deal with them.  Chiaki takes them to the secret passageway, where Mikan manages to separate her from everyone else through convenient trap doors and when the others wonder why she's missing, they accept Mikan's excuse that she's wasn't \"feeling well and rested in a room they previously passed\".  Nevermind, she was well just a moment ago, also how that contrasted with her determination shown earlier, and you know, the fact this is enemy territory! Nekomaru and Gundham catch up at this time, getting the location from Mikan.  Chiaki wakes up to find Chisa who lies that Izuru helped her escape, and they decide to meet up with the rest of the class.  From then on, well, it goes as well as you'd expect...\\n\\n\r\nChiaki's death made me sad but it wasn't as tearjerking as it could have been.   All of her exploits of keeping the class together were just told to us and mostly off screen.  The build up to her execution was poor by having everyone passing around the idiot ball to have plot happen.  Also throughout it all, I couldn't hold back my disbelief on how Junko managed to configure all those traps and build the trial room all in the span of at least days, and none of the authoritative figures in the school or the board of directors noticed, either because they will either ignore it anyway or are grossly incompetent.\\n\\n\r\nI mean I liked all the continuity nods and fanservice provided, but that's not enough to hold the story together.  When it came to the Despair arc, the fanservice and establishing ties to the Future arc were more important than telling a coherent story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I also liked was the portrayal of Junko and the resulting disillusionment for a good portion of the fanbase.  Another aspect I believe this series intended to do was really hammer home how Junko is a irredeemable character.  Mukuro was also disillusioned to many.\\n\\n\r\nDespair arc has fanservice and hit-or-miss humor going for it.  Many things happen because they need to and not if it makes any sense.  The format really limited the series as there was simply not enough time to expand on all the plot points, resulting in too much going on at once and not enough focus on the main characters, the ones the story should mainly be about.",

            "content": "As a fan of the Danganronpa games, specially the second one, I was quite looking forward to this anime. I wanted to see more about the main cast of SDR2 and learn about how they fell to despair. \r\n[This review may contain spoilers]\r\nIn my honest opinion, if it weren't for the simultaneous weekly release along with Future Arc, I think this anime would've felt way weaker. That was the purpose, after all. While it still felt a bit weak to me, I did enjoy it. I do think this anime greatly surpassed the first installment in the anime adaptations for the series. \r\nAs for thestory, we mostly knew the basics. We knew how it would go down. Starting from a slice of life, sliding into a despairful mess of chaos. What I definitely mostly enjoyed was the change into the actual title of the series - DESPAIR. However, it escalated rather quickly which made it feel less realistic, but since they had to tuck in a lot of content in such a small amount of episodes, I won't pay that much attention to that detail. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the strong point from Danganronpa are its characters. It managed to get me attatched to the new characters. The introduction of the trio investigating (Munakata, Sakakura, Chisa - being her the narrator) Hope's Academy was a good thing and created a refreshing contrast between their point of view and the students'. Also, it painted the academy in a whole new light. However this also was the cause of how apart and plain the main cast from SDR2 felt. They barely got focused (with some exceptions) on and almost felt like supporting characters. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, what mostly bugged me was how Nanami was created as a real person for the anime. While at the start it was well handled, it all went down and became a bit disappointing when she just literally became a tool for Junko. Coming from SDR2, I was expecting Junko to act like Junko and destroy every characters individually, or at least more slowly than how it went down on the anime. This both made Junko's and Nanami's character feel more lazy than they actually are. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was okay and I specially enjoyed the remakes of the original tracks from the games. It made it feel more like Danganronpa. Both OP&ED were really great and really well handled in the smallest details. The original tracks from the anime weren't specially outstanding or memorable, so I wouldn't say the music was one of the strongest points of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation: I am really picky and critical about this point. While they did a good job with the colors (contrasting with the dark palette of Future Arc) - something that gradually changed along with the tone of the anime-, the animation could've been way better. The movement was really not fluid and most of the time it felt kind of awkward. This is completely a biased opinion but I feel that the animes never really imitated Rui Komatsuzaki's art that well. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, as a whole I really enjoyed the anime. I'm still a fan and did get emotional with my favorite characters and even the new characters. It's better than the first anime and even if it has some weak points it's definitely worth watching if you're a fan of the games.",

            "content": "Welcome to the last week of this year's horror anime month. In order to wrap things up, let's look at the other instalment of Danganronpa 3, Zetsubou-hen. Is it an improvement over the other half of Danganronpa 3, just as weak or worse? I suppose the only way to find out is to watch and determine for ourselves. So, let's take a look.\r\nStory:\r\nZetsubou-hen opens with Yukizome taking a teacher's role at Hope's Peak Academy as part of an investigation into the Academy's more shady pursuits. She's assigned to the 77th class and begins her work in earnest, both as a teacher and an investigator. Allwhile events are moving towards the great world-changing event of ultimate despair.\\n\\n\r\nTherein lies the biggest flaw with the series. If you saw the first Danganronpa, you know how it's going to end. Even if you haven't, the series itself calls it a tale of hope that ends in despair. Which could work, if they built up some tension in another way. But the series never bothers. About half of it is spent on vaguely slice of life school life with very minor references to Yukizome's investigation. Then we get a bunch of episodes setting up Junko's machinations. Most of the series is just build up to a pretty disappointing climax. To make matters worse, if you happen to have watched Mirai-hen first, like I did, then you'll know the exact plot points to expect. The series also shares Mirai-hen's weakness of having a lot of bad, over-blown speeches. The only difference is that the ones in Zetsubou-hen are mostly about despair instead of hope.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I do appreciate what the series was trying to do. When it comes right down to it, it's trying to humanise the group that Naegi got called a traitor for protecting. It's trying to get you to connect with and understand them. There's just one problem with that. Let's talk about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe Danganronpa series in general isn't good at providing compelling characters. The first anime got around that by providing good mysteries. The Mirai-hen part of Danganronpa 3 tried to do the same, but ended up spending too much time with strangely absurd action sequences and puerile hope speeches. This series doesn't even have that to fall back on. We know that Junko's the villain as soon as she shows up. We see what Hope's Peak is up to before there's much investigation into it. We know that things are going to end in despair. So, what we're left with are shallow archetypical characters who spend the bulk of the series doing nothing interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs continue to be a weakness. Although this may be the part of the series that's least effected by it since a good half of it is about the students just being students. The series does have a strange habit of making the non-important characters just look like blue humanoid blobs. Maybe they didn't want normal looking people and they didn't want to bother coming up with stupid looking designs for background characters. I will credit this series for having bloody sequences that are fairly competent. Although they do use bizarre neon colouring for it. Maybe they were on a time slot where they couldn't show much blood so they worked around it by making the blood not look like blood.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThis is one area where I have to give every instalment of this franchise credit. They are good at casting. Ogata Megumi, Hanazawa Kana, Toyoguchi Megumi, Takayama Minami & Nakahara Mai are all good in this. In spite of their characters lacking any real complexity. Really, none of the actors do a bad job. They're all basically competent. The music is also decent enough.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a bit. Junko's sister seems to have a thing for her. I have no idea why they included that, but it's there. The photographer has a girl that she seems to have a thing with. The chef is openly bisexual and it's revealed that a certain gent is in love with another man. That being said, this stuff barely comes up and is, mostly, not important to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's Danganronpa 3: Zetsubou-hen. Ultimately, its big failing is that its whole raison d'etre is to get you invested in bland characters. In the interest of doing so, it lacks mystery and has very little that could be charitably called horror. If you're a big fan of the franchise and you really want to see the events that built up to the grand hyper worst despair-inducing situation, you might find it interesting. Maybe. For myself, I'm going to give it a 3/10. While it is pretty bad, there's nothing truly terrible about it. Next week I'll open November with a review of 91 Days. Have a happy Halloween and retain your fabulousity.",

            "content": "LA is gonna change up the format for this review as well as Mirai-hen by making it a sorta of 3-parter due to the nature of how Danganronpa 3's animes were presented so if you wanted to see LA's take on Mirai-hen and Kibou-hen then this review won't be in it.\r\nBefore LA talks about Zetsubou-hen, LA will say that both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen anime are something of a companion piece with each other giving off clues or events that transpired that lead it to how or when it happened. The obvious companion piece both these anime have is \"trying to find the traitor\" and whysome of the founders are butting heads with each other in Mirai-hen and \"how Danganronpa's franchise started\" as well as some backstory on some of the newer characters in Mirai-hen for Zetsubou-hen and both arcs gives and feeds information to each other. For anime-episode order, you should/MUST watch by starting with Mirai-hen's episode then Zetsubou-hen episode then back and forth after that for \"clarity\". Once both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen have finished finishing with Mirai-hen's final episode go to Kibou-hen for the finale. Ohh and MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!...don't say LA didn't warn you! \\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way\\n\\n\r\nZetsubou-hen is at first vastly different from Mirai-hen being a bit more of a slice of life comedy highschool anime with all the eccentric characters and the daily lives of the Ultimates in Hope Peak High, but considering the obvious that this season is called \"Despair arc\"...you know that the atmosphere will drastically change.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, well if remembering the characters in Danganronpa 2, then the entire cast of 77B is back and this and more or less the first half of this anime is pure fanservice. But from this, Chiaki Nanami voiced by Kana Hanazawa, Chisa Yukizome, Hajime Hinata voiced by Minami Takayama, Nagito Komaeda voiced by Megumi Ogata as well as many of the more important newer characters from Mirai-hen do get their character development/backstory given to them in this arc, mostly because this is a prequel to the game, it's to be expected that there would be some form of development to the characters that mattered and caused what occurred in the game. Even saying it's a prequel really doesn't harm Zetsubou-hen though as LA said earlier it's fanservice to even see the characters in Danganronpa 2 animated. But one little problem comes in which is although we get mostly comedic fanservice from most of the main cast of Zetsoubou-hen mainly 77B, the focus to Zetsubou-hen goes more to the \"more important and plot forward\" characters (Hajime, Izuru Kamukura, Nagito, The Enoshima Twins, Juzo, Munakata, Chisa and Ryota to be precise) as well as giving us clarity with little subtle nods to Mirai-hen's ordeal with their newer characters as a bit of bonus (and more clue finding for Mirai-hen's part) like Seiko, Izayoi and Ruruka's own \"episodes\" and Juzo, Munakata and Chisa in detail MUCH later on. But if there was a flaw with Zetsubou-hen being a prequel is that if you've played Danganronpa 2...the prequel will ultimately leave them to their doom...*ahem* despair, the plot pre-ordianed them to this and the flaw can massively hurt as you just know they will end up like they were in the game, Class of 77B were effectively comedic fanservice until the plot told them \"they were important to move the plot forward and destined to how they become in the game\". If there was a favorite character in Zetsubou-hen it goes to Junko Enoshima, but as for the Ultimates...LA was always fond of Sonia Nevermind voiced by Miho Arakawa and Akane Owari voiced by Romi Park in the game and Chiaki Nanami voiced by Kana Hanazawa deserves top billing in the Ultimates however and it obviously was transferred into the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, well in contrast to Mirai-hen's bleaker animation palette, Zetsoubou-hen's color palette is definitely brighter and vibrant as a disguise as to what kind of despair is gonna happen sooner or later, from gaming homages and little 8-Bit vers. of the Zetsubou-hen cast to just the vibrant character designs to turn it into the dull, bleaker blood-red tinge of Mirai-hen. Ohh and the pink blood is back in Zetsubou-hen in all it's gory ahh LA means glory and it does get GORY. The animation may be \"ok\" but Zetsubou-hen can sure bring in it's aesthetic value and GORY detail when it really starts getting intense, sure the animation is slightly inconsistent but it's aesthetic detail to the later episodes makes up for that IMMENSELY.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially Zetsubou-hen is Danganronpa fanservice as well as backstory for nearly every single thing that happened in the series (as well as from Mirai-hen's characters) as a well defined prequel, which means yes, we get to see the The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History as well as how Hope Peak's Academy actually functioned before AND AFTER Junko Enoshima came in. There are ALOT of Danganronpa homage fanservice here and there which HELPS SOOO MUCH and for *ahem* ecchi fanservice, well if you like it of not Episode 2 and 7 is there if you want it. *cough* aphrodisiac curry *cough* Nagito *cough*\\n\\n\r\nAAAAND on speaking of Junko Enoshima, if there was anything LA could say about this eccentrically schizophrenic villain in the series is that she is most probably one of the greatest villains in anime, not only for her personality and pure nihilist tendencies but for what lengths she will go to for what she wants, she is one of the thee smartest, calculating, bizarrely cold hearted and eccentric villains in anime LA has seen and Zetsubou-hen shows it as raw as possible...why does LA utterly praised Junko?...well not only does she take LA's favourite character in Zetsubou-hen (Or LA is an Ultimate Despair...LA really does love the pure insane eccentric villains, why do you think LA put Nui Harime in LA's favourite characters list?) but Junko's craving for nihilism/despair as all the rest a la order is boring is a best if LA could say this as an analogy...like the Joker from the Dark Knight Trilogy. Why?...well sure you could easily say that it's quite obvious as both Junko and Joker have the same belief system. Nihilism. But even their methods are the same!. (Sorry for the tangent but this was bottled in LA and LA might as well say it now). Let's see Junko essentially toppled a hierarchy of Hope Peaks Academy by finding out all the funds from the Reserve Course was used essentially to fund human experimentation, thus breaking the order of Hope......Peak Academy, then using Izuru Kamakura the \"Ultimate Hope\" into \"despair\" by blaming the The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History on Izuru and by the end of it Izuru will see which one is harder to predict, hope or despair?. The Joker?...tried to cause chaos ultimately destroying the foundation of Gotham City and using Harvey Dent as the pinnacle of hope in Gotham and make Harvey believe that the order of Gotham needs to change...like adopt the Joker's anarchy thus becoming Two-Face. Junko Enoshima is to the Joker, as Izuru Kamakura is to Harvey Dent. <LA sighs>...Juuko Enoshima is a great villain ain't she???...aaand LA watched the Dark Knight too much.\\n\\n\r\nOk ok back on topic...what was next ohhh right! In terms of voice acting, just like Mirai-hen, we've got an excellent voice cast with reprisals from the Danganronpa 2 game at that and even though LA only watched a Let's Play of Danganronpa 2 in English on Youtube, still the Japanese voice cast is AMAZING from Kana Hanazawa to Yuu Koyabashi to Romi Park and Ai Kayano to heck even Kotono Mitsuishi. But quite eaisly, best voice actor in Zetsubou-hen goes to Megumi Toyoguchi as Junko Enoshima AND Mukuro Ikusaba as the Despair Twins.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending brought up some plot holes that just wasn't told which was a problem and really MANY things in Zetsubou-hen was retconned but considering many of the other Dangaronpa materials LA hasn't consumed yet (Danganronpa Zero etc.) so LA can take a few liberties towards it due to Zetsubou-hen bringing in some of the other material into homages to itself, but the ONLY plot hole LA really couldn't oversee is with Chiaki *MAJOR SPOILERS* and for those who have watched it, it's obvious what LA is gonna talk about, it is if Chiaki died by Junko's execution plans, Zetsubou-hen NEVER tells us how a \"real-flesh character\" like Chaiki gets turned into AI and goes into the Neo World Program, like did Chiaki plan something before it, did one of the Mirai-hen characters upload her or created her...it was NEVER explained. Nonetheless Zetsubou-hen being a prequel and bringing in a per-determined ending and with that one major plot hole, LA was still ok with this, a bit annoyed but ok.\\n\\n\r\nZetsubou-hen may have had a slow but fanservicey start, but by the end, LA thinks that Zetsoubou-hen trumped Mirai-hen if LA goes by what happens in near the finale of it fully showing the events that transpired the original and it's sequel games but where (true?) hope is in sight for Mirai-hen, Zetsubou-hen by it's title alone, you'll know it'll sink into despair as it being a prequel deemed it to happen. A prequel in ANY kind of media has it's huge problems, but LA is safe to say that Zetsubou-hen is quite safe from the deluge of problems prequels in the media have and it helps that Mirai-hen was a great companion piece anime to Zetsubou-hen to make it a unique prequel anime on it's own right and an even more complex set of animes together. Even if many things from Zetsubou-hen's timeline to the games are retconned and really for what LA \"researched\" (Only being Danganronpa 2 and Ultra Despair Girls through Youtube) for an \"anime only\" timeline following the prequel to really the launching pad for the entire franchise, LA was overall satisfied by it, retcon and plot holes and all, be it LA trying to find clues to Mirai-hen or wanting to find out how this really ALL started and that in itself was enough for LA to overlook it's flaws...but still realize it HAS these flaws.",

            "content": "This review is also based off the game Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair. (Possible very minor spoilers)\r\nThe story is about how the characters from the game Danganronpa 2 became Despairs. So the story is about what happened before Danganronpa 2 took place and how they came to be Despairs, which is obvious cause it's called the despair arc. Which I think they have did a good job of trying to accomplish this, but I have a few minor disappointments. Besides that the story is very interesting. But in my opinion it felt a bit rushed.\r\nThe art is good and is it very true to the series.But with a few disappoints such as, Gundham Tanaka and Hiyoko Saionji's hair is different. Besides those few minor details, they did a great job. Chiaki Nanami is THE Ultimate Waifu, enough with this \"Ultimate Gamer\". (she didn't deserve what happened to her in episode 10)\\n\\n\r\nI really like the opening for this animei and its pretty catchy in my opinion. I didn't hear much background music throughout the anime, so there's nothing really I can say there.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters personalities have stayed the same as in the game, so no disappointments there. They kept Peko and Fuyuhiko's relationship between them secretive as they did in the game. They did a lot of these things, such as, Hiyoko's loathful attitude towards Mikan. Akane and Nekomaru's rivalry between each other and Kazuichis one-sided love for Sonia, etc. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this series this season, definitely something worth checking out. I really recommend you watch a playthrough of the game or play it yourself before you watch this anime, it will make a little more sense if you do.",

            "content": "Man I love Danganronpa. Guys I am a BIIIIIIG Danganronpa fan ...I mean look at my name and picture.When I finished the First game I was shocked of how AWESOME that shit was.I thought there will be no way Danganrona 2 be better than the first....but i was wrong...........oh boy I was ......and thats when I have fell into ETERNAL ZETSUBOU!!!!!Ok I apologize for the long intro, what I am trying to say is that every entry in the series sets the bar so high for the next entry to overcome. When Danganronpa 3 was announced , I just couldn't wait to see it ...andi honestly I was anticipating the despair arc more than the future one and I gotta say...........I am quite dissapointed :(\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nDespair arc keeps the hyperbolic vibrant colors from the past entries and WOW it is GORGEOUS.....The abundance of cheerful colors in this anime really makes you feel the hope atmosphere,it is really beautiful.However the character drawings in some instance are really horrible compared to the game designs...I felt like the details for the characters were decreased and that honestly made it feel as if an amateur was drawing the character ...kind of reminds of higurashi. Overall the art is really beautiful...it takes the danganronpa aesthetics and applies them into a hope world where you can literally feel the solace in the scenes but I honestly preferred the future arc art which I would be reviewing later\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is actually shared between future and despair arc but each anime recycles certain past soundtracks that fits its themes. In this anime I am not gonna say I was wowed....I felt it was pretty lazy.The new tracks were honestly not as good as the ones before...But I am always a sucker for any of the past danganronpa soundtracks which i really loved hearing them again here.Last but not least....I loved the opening....DAMN I would they really made a nice choice with kami iro awasi, the song's has the feel of serenity and nostalgia,Definitely something that fits the anime perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10\\n\r\nok lets stop with the small things and get down to buisness. The thing about the 1st danganronpa adaption is that it fails to adapt the narrative style of the game. Danganronpa 1 and 2 were pretty slow but the narration was perfect...you really feel the moment of every scene but the anime adaption fail because of restricted number of episodes and as result it ended up being to fast and not as good as the game. Now they did the same risk here and I gotta say....HOLY SHIT...The narration style of this anime is GARBAGE!!!Like seriously you don`t feel as if the anime is telling a story, you feel like the anime is just a series of flashback and  and events that are transitioned sooooooooooo SHITly if such a word exist. Let's take a closer look. Honestly the first 2 episodes were PERFECT..Literally what I wanted from a prequel. It  starts of really upbeat and hopeful. You even get see how the new characters introduced in danganronpa 3 future had influence in the past events. Not to mention how you get say the times spent between Hinata and Nanami which was SOOOOOO SWEEEEET..But then everything gets broken....you see the anime goes at an EXTREMELY FAST PACE....I am not kidding, this is the worst story pacing i've ever seen in an anime. You have that episode that is entirely covering the twilight syndrome events..I honestly had goosebumps when I knew that it's finally gonna happen..but that episode had everything wrong with danganronpa 3 despair arc....It was so brief and summarized and there are certain things that I was longing to learn about from this episode wasn't there!!!!! It was awful. From this episode the anime starts to just link side stories and skim through events...and that's a big problem. Another example, there is this episode that is dedicated entirely to further build up few characters from the future arc. I do appreciate that  to some extent...but when you look at the bigger picture you will realize that it was awkwardly placed there...it is the most boring episode in the anime....and then a HUUUUUUUUUGE TIME SKIP!!!!!!!!!! The last thing that really disappointed me in this anime is the \"Master plan\" leading to the tragedy..I will not talk  in details here to avoid spoilers...But I really found it underwhelming, it wasn't as despairing as i thought it would be and...wait *SNIFF* *SNIFF*...what is this smell???.....OMG......it's PLOT HOLES????????Ok now there were some parts that were good in the story i wont lie...there were themes at least....but i still can't believe that spike chunsoft made a BROKEN and HALF-ASSED story....I am shocked seriously...Really wouldn't have lost any part of the experience had i just read the story through the wiki pages...it's the same thing....BLAND AS HELL\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\r\nOk i wouldn't say the characters are bad but it definitely was mediocre. First of all, The ENTIRE Danganronpa 2 cast were USELESS in this anime WITH few exceptions: Nanami and Hinata. I felt sometimes that those characters with the hollow figures were more interesting. I mean literally they have verrryyy little to do here...they just goof around the entire series. Although I mentioned exceptions but even those exceptions were not that good. At the beginning there were really nice relationship scenes between Nanami and Hinata, but The anime just decides to minimize it at the end in favor of including more SHIT. I even felt that Enoshima Junko was...well just Enoshima Junko..nothing new. There wasn't alot of moments were I really felt disturbed from her. Infact, she started to feel annoying. However What really saved this anime for me at least are the new characters ESPECIALLY Ryota Mitarai. I felt the anime build them up really . Actually you cant tell that there was more focus on them due to their screen time and they did a good job , but sacrificing some parts to improve others is not what a great anime does\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nThe only thing that pushed far to complete this arc is my danganronpa fetish. Honestly there are some parts that i really enjoyed from my heart but there are other parts that I forced myself to enjoy. Honestly, There are ALOOT of plot points in this anime that would've been more awesome given that would've been great had the the direction was better. I found myself thinking about the anime several times and realize...well actually that was pretty good but yeah it wasn't effective. usually Danganronpa is the type of story that will grip your heart untill the very end. but that's not the case here. The anime really failed to deliver some interesting plot points in an interesting way \\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nOk maybe it's not that bad as I have made it sound..there were some redeeming qualities..add that to your despair addiction and you will find yourself enjoying this anime at few parts. But let's be honest here...Kodaka can make PERFECT GAMES!!!but anime...there are  restriction when it comes to anime and one of them is time...We all know that danganronpa is a story that likes to take its time building a great story..but in anime this is hard. IN my personal opinion with this type of quality it would've been acceptable if despair arc was just a 2 hour movie without adding alot of shit...that way future arc would've been given more episodes and time to build itself.Future arc is WAAAY better than despair arc but it still have some issues...I will make a conclusion on the entire Danganronpa 3 series when the hope arc comes out.In the end, Dangonronpa 3 is a fair anime with a broken story elements and missed opportunities that had some enjoyment in it",

            "content": "Starting my first review, I want to make some things clear. First of all, this isn't a good anime. It's not even decent, despite my score. Danganronpa 3 is just bad. If you didn't play the game, you probably won't understand anything. And if you did play it, you will probably end up disappointed, just like me. Secondly, it's this type of anime that is just poorly arranged. It has plot holes and doesn't offer anything that haven't been in this universe before. Also there will be spoilers from the rest of the series. Okay, let's start the proper review. \r\nDanganronpa 3 was supposed tobe supplement for both Danganronpa 1 and 2. Yet it failed miserably. Well, maybe not exactly, since you do get the reasons why some characters went bad, and you do get to see Twilight Syndrome Murder Case, student council massacre and the rise of Izuru Kamukura. But it's neither well-written nor interesting. Everyone expected that anime adaptation of Twilight Syndrome Murder Case will be something with a huge impact on the characters, something tragic, something that could lead to despair. In the anime this major problem was solved in one episode, which presents almost nothing that we wouldn't know from game. It also doesn't seem like anyone remembered it for more than two weeks. \\n\\n\r\nSo how about main plot? Do we get to see an interesting manipulation that leads class 77 to despair side? Yes, we do get to see what leaded to despair. And it's probably the biggest flaw in this anime. It's just so disappointing and became objects of many memes. Seriously, I'd never thought that main flaw in Danganropa would be plot. But how about other things? Maybe we get something interesting like interactions between DR1 characters and DR2 characters? Or maybe DR/Zero characters appear? Maybe even a Hope Peak's Elementary? No, no, no, don't count on it. The whole DR/Zero is completely ignor- oh no, I forgot that they've shown two characters for like 5 seconds and that's it. Only the first two episodes were about characters, and they were honestly the best ones. \\n\\n\r\nClass 77, despite being main characters, is mostly absent, aside for fan favourites like Komaeda or Chiaki, but I didn't care about them. Why would I? Chiaki became perfect waifu that only plays games and is good-looking. And obviously every character likes her. Nagito on the other hand, while being an overally interesting character, has \"power of luck\" and talks about hope non-stop. He didn't change at all. Sometimes Mikan or Ultimate Impostor appear, but only UI gets development. Mikan only serves a cheap fanservice purpose here, which made me hate her even more. In the second half there also appears Junko Enoshima and her sister Mukuro Ikusaba, the 16th student, lying somewhere hidden in the school, the one that's called the ultimate despair. It's nice to see our main antagonist back, but instead of making her intelligent and ruthless manipulant, like she was in the game, she became an unoriginal and boring Joker-like villian. She just lost her charm.\\n\r\nThe rest of the \"main characters\" almost don't appear in show, which is another reason why I don't like this anime. Why not include more of Ibuki, another fan favourite? Why not explain Hiyoko's or Mikan's background? Why does Mahiru act like a completely different person? Seriously, it's just wasted potential. So what about new characters? In Zetsubou-hen most important new characters are Chisa Yukizome - teacher in Hope Peak - Juzo Sakakura (former ultimate boxer) and Ryouta Mitarai, another ultimate student. The first one is a typical, energetic teacher that could appear in any other anime. Frankly, I didn't quite care about her. I won't write anything about Juzo, because he's probably the best character in this anime and his story is alright. The last one, Mitarai is a whinny, weak person, whose biggest passion is anime. He's also one of the reason why the plot is so bad. There are also a few others like Munakata, but I'll write about him in my Mirai-hen review. I appreciate the fact that they tried to create new characters, but I still prefer the old cast. \\n\\n\r\nI really don't care about graphic, but for me it's decent. There are some flaws in animation but I didn't notice them while watching or I just simply ignored them. The music is really nice to listen to. There are some familiar tracks that every fan will recognize. Opening is also really pleasant to the ear. As for ending - sung by Megumi Ogata - it's not bad, but it's not my favourite either. Like every adaptation should, this one does include the original VAs. They are as good as always, despite being on screen for a short time. \\n\\n\r\nSo did I enjoyed this? While it was airing, yes. But only because of threads on 4chan or other websites and that I hoped it will have something that I mentioned earlier. Well, maybe hype ruined it, but I don't think so. It was supposed to be about class 77, relationship between them, their backstory and how they ended up as the bad guys. They tried, but failed. And now, after the year has passed, I can say that I didn't enjoyed it.",

            "content": "I N T R O D U C T I O N\r\nI've been a fan of the Danganronpa game series since 2012. In 2013, Danganronpa: The Animation came out, and honestly, it was crap. The animation and art was pitiful, the characters were barely grazed and hardly as deep as the corresponding game had it, and it was just rushed. But that's the thing with animating an entire game in 13 episodes-- it's not possible to fit every scenario, so the anime had to condense it for only the main plot points to appear.\r\nNow, why do I mention the first animation when I should betalking about the 3rd Despair Arc? You need to be aware of my disappointment for that, so that you can understand I was overall impressed with the effort put into Danganronpa 3, both sides. The Despair Arc cannot be seen without knowing the plots of the 1st and 2nd Danganronpa games, so unless you've seen it, you'll likely be thoroughly confused. But anyways, Despair Arc explains the events before the 1st game, which had me interested to see. It's like more puzzle pieces were given to the viewer, to try to fathom all of this \"hope\" and \"despair\" madness. I wasn't very disappointed with what I got, thankfully enough.\\n\\n\r\nS H O R T C O M I N G S\\n\r\nI was introduced with the students of SD2 (Super Danganronpa 2) and some characters from the Future Arc, such as the homeroom teacher, Yukizome Chisa, the leader of the later Future Foundation, Munakata Kyosuke, etc. Getting to see them animated, along with new characters that I welcomed fairly enough, was exciting. However, I only get glimpses of their personalities, it seems? My personal expectations in an anime this short isn't very high on character, but again, I felt like I got only a taste of what the students were truly like (I won't spoil anything from SD2). I honestly wish I'd gotten more. \\n\\n\r\nFor the first two episodes, you feel like you're watching a slice-of-life, ridiculous comedy with friendships and rainbows and idealistic school life (also with that one perverted cook and that fanservice of pantsus). Then, well I love this, but it all just goes downhill and you know it. However, it felt like the beginning could've been more blended to the more despairing episodes that come after. It felt a bit more sudden than what it could've. It's somewhat predictable too as a whole, but I've already known the aftermath of these events, so I suppose it can't really be helped.\\n\\n\r\nThis kind of goes back to the characters, and maybe I'm not so forgiving for unrealistic scenarios, but these characters don't make sense. When you see someone you care about get killed, you won't follow the killer and do what she wishes, right? You'd either plot revenge or try to move on, almost ignoring what had happened. Or something else. Just not follow the one who murdered someone you care about. Also, some of these character's motives, their passion, are somewhat strange. One character is so passionate about making an anime to the point of sleepless nights, skipping school entirely, and acting like a high-strung, insane, desperate person. It seems like none of these characters are normal, which is kind of the thing Danganronpa has, but IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR A SANE PERSON? And no, I don't want just the principal, that old man, and that drunk guy! And Junko, control yourself! (I was joking, don't stone me)\\n\\n\r\nWhen I watched this, I was starting to expect two things: more explanation for Enoshima Junko's motives, and more story to Kamukura Izuru. I honestly didn't get much from either, at least, things I didn't already know. Kamukura was okay, but Junko felt so stupid to me. Like, is she just evil because she's just evil? She looks like a fool, honestly. I liked her in the 1st and 2nd games because she wasn't that big of a character, sort of, but now that she's a more appearing character, with her actions open like a book, it feels like she just does ridiculous things just because. And it feels stupid! No backstory, just because. And she has everything her way. \\n\\n\r\nBut then again, WWII happened, and this might be somewhat the same deal.\\n\\n\r\nP R O S\\n\r\nI could go on for a while regarding the good points. Again, seeing SD2's characters animated was real fun to watch. I was especially curious about Komaeda Nagito, Hajime Hinata and Nanami Chiaki. And, in case you haven't noticed, I watched this first before Future Arc, and finished it first too.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I got from this was pleasantly some Ikusaba Mukuro, which for some reason I didn't expect that much of. Even though her character was somewhat dissed off, I got to see her devotion to her sister and sides of her I otherwise wouldn't have seen. I also found more importance in Chiaki. Not that she wasn't important to the second game, but I always thought she was a little strange and off. Seeing her hope throughout this anime, in the midst of despair, was impressive. I also enjoyed most of the characters, as they kept this anime light, mostly.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the little tidbits, I think I see most of the characters in Despair Arc in Future Arc. Since they aired around the same time, I could switch back and forth if I wanted, and I found that doing so will explain things in the Future Arc. It'll explain some bad and good relationships between characters there. I also appreciated the cameos of the characters in Danganronpa 1.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the art, along with the music. I was majorly impressed. The animation was well done, and the art was consistent, and effort is shown in that department. It seemed like the games' tone was split in half, creating the tones of the Despair and Future arcs. The signature pink blood remained, but the colors were much brighter and lighter. As the story progressed, the colors did change, and oh my gosh the opening changes as you watch, I loved that. It just got darker and darker, and I was warned in the beginning that the story will end in despair, but still-- it's so enticing! And hearing Komaeda's VA sing the ED was heavenly.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I didn't really like the OP and ED, and that was because it didn't feel Danganronpa-like. It didn't have that jazz-pop feel that I adored. But it started to grow on me, and it made me realize that the despairing events occur midway of this anime, so it was appropriate. Midway, the soundtrack does switch a bit more to the familiar tunes you often get with Monokuma, so I'm satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nC L O S U R E\\n\r\nThis is probably the longest review I've written, but I literally just finished this anime and it's Saturday. I've yet to finish the Future Arc, and I know I probably spoiled some things without realizing it, but it's nothing explicit and in fact, you should expect the above things already? It's Danganronpa, wake up.\\n\\n\r\nI think this animation was amazingly done, compared to the first season. This isn't based off of any game, just shows events outside of the games. I'm glad the creators made that choice, though, as these events aren't exactly game-material and more for something like this. As I learn more and more about Danganronpa's story like how Once Upon A Time shows it (present to past, to present, to past), it's like more puzzle pieces are coming and eventually, will show a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nI can't wait for that day, when I know all of it. Hope will triumph over despair, you guys. ;)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 38/50 ~ 76% ~ 8/10",

            "content": "I'm using my small introduction for reviewing both this and Future so you may see this twice.\r\nI used to be a big Danganronpa fan. I got the VITA for the sole purpose of playing the games, when SDR2 was only getting translated by some random people on the internet and the first game had just gotten localized. I've spent a lot of my time on Danganronpa, analyzing it, doing fanarts, discussing theories with other people, reading the fan-translated novels, playing Ultra Despair Girls, and although it had some flaws, I really the Danganronpa series overall.\r\nBut when I knew that they announced an anime, I justhad this bad feeling. Danganronpa: The Animation wasn't really good, as the quantity of episodes was just not enough for the hole plot and it tried to fit like 20+ hours of gameplay in 13 episodes of approximately 25 minutes. 20+ of gameplay, details, plot, characters, into less than 6 hours approximately of an animation. And obviously, the adaptation wasn't really the best. But I thought, \"Hey, they won't make the same mistake twice. Besides, two arcs? That's a total of 24 episodes, so maybe it will be different!\"\\n\\n\r\nOh, how wrong I was.\\n\\n\r\nBoth despair and future side just tried to throw in a bowl and mix a lot of characters, random plot ideas, deaths with no meaning, and terrible death flags that screamed \"hey lol i'm gonna die now\". One of the major things about Danganronpa that I liked was how ridiculous, yet interesting the plot twists were. Even if you expected some of them, it was interesting to see how the dots connected, the contradictions, the solutions, and the characters going through that trip to the truth. And sometimes the twist would make you go \"holy shit\", because you didn't really get to see them coming.\\n\\n\r\nDanganronpa 3 didn't include any of those. Instead, the supposedly \"plot twists\" were so predictable, they basically screamed to your face \"enjoy this characters because we are going to kill it\". All the raising of death flags was painful to see, it felt like watching a Blue's Clues episode of how obvious everything was. A lot of cheap and mediocre tactics to get the ratings up, including unnecessary weird fanservice (although I kind of can let that pass because almost all animes do that), fake deaths of loved characters to keep the \"cliffhanger up\", and most of the \"cliffhangers\" were basically thrown out to hell next episodes as they killed the hype.\\n\\n\r\nSupposedly, Despair side was about the class of SDR2 (which I'm not getting into as it may spoil, but if you plan on watching it, at least watch a playthrough of the game if you want to understand). It started fine, as most of the watchers are at familiar with the cast, with the typical cliche unnecessary fanservice, including a small ecchi scene, but not that terrible to throw it all to hell. But around the fourth episode, they started skipping stuff. Important stuff. Weird, unclear time skips that just didn't make a lot of sense. At first, I personally believed it was just for the sake of time, as they had other characters from the class to dig in. But I was wrong. Instead, the time was mostly spent on other characters that I won't give names, because again, it would spoil a little bit.There was almost no development on the SDR2 class, and they were mostly joke characters filling the background for some minutes.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of stuff contradicted the canon, the novels were not considered, Nanami Chiaki went basically to a whiny Mary Sue depending on Hinata Hajime despite knowing him little, looking like on of those over exaggerated cliche shoujo protagonists. Komaeda Nagito was only a \"hope boner\" instead of an interesting character with different views that were interesting to analyze. And others character didn't get the stage for more than 5 minutes. Knowing the characters from SDR2 was totally pointless, as they were made into cliche, badly \"developed\" characters, if you can call that \"development.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime just killed the essence of Danganronpa itself. No surprises, no cliffhangers, no plot twists, no character development. Just a terrible ripoff of Dora the Explorer with murder and some crappy hope vs despair plot.\\n",

However, I was completely let down with the story line. I felt that the story was completely rushed. Also that certain aspects of the plot jut didn't make sense. For example most of the characters are in high school and all of these \"awful & tragic\" things were happening. I started to think were are these kids parent or guardian. (Even thoughanime is not restricted, if an anime decides to use a certain genre in the story there are certain aspect and expectations that are group with that).\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound-  The art was modern, however at some points video game visuals appeared. Sound was also good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Their was a character for ever type of personality. I liked how some of the characters were relatable. Their personalities really compliments each other. However no one character stood put from the pack and made a personal impression on me. Nonetheless, they all have a role to play. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I didn't enjoy this anime because I felt that it was so bland and didn't make sense. I found myself watching it not because I wanted too but because I had nothing else to do. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- I only watched this anime due to the fact that I have seen the first Danganronpa. I essentially just wanted clarification on certain aspects of that anime. Even though this anime did give an explanation, I felt that they just pulled it out of thin air. Complete let down.\\n\\n",

            "content": "With me being such a big fan of the games and the first game anime adaption being fairly lackluster my expectations for the future and despair arc were quite mixed (although that didn't stop me from being super hyped), but now that shows over I think my hype was rightfully placed. Also quick disclaimer, you should have absolutely played the first two games before watching these.\r\nIn the despair arc the anime follows the characters of the 2nd game taking place when they first join Hope's Peak Academy before the events of either game. The show starts off fairly slow and laid back but don't befooled because the show only gets darker and darker as it progresses, you may think you've hit the peak of despair in one episode then BAM the despair hits even harder later on until we eventually hit \"The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History\".\\n\\n\r\nComing into this season I was really wondering how well they would portray the characters because I absolutely loved the cast from the 2nd game and let me say they did a spot on job capturing the unique quirkiness of all of them, right down to Mikans incredible clumsiness, Akanes never ending hunger, Hiyokos total bitchiness towards Mikan, TeruTerus pervertedness and etc. The show also does a great job throwing in nice little tidbits of information/back story at you through out, stuff like Hiyokos random growth spurt, where the Ultimate Imposter comes from and the relationship between Junko & Mukuro. Overall they do a great job with the characters and the character development, they are absolutely the shining point of this show.\\n\\n\r\nNow like I said the show starts off slow but very quickly changes into a never ending ride on the despair train with no brakes. But with that being said it never stops being entertaining to watch, whether it was watching the shenanigans of the 2nd games cast, the interactions between Junko and basically everyone else whether she be in a playful mode with her sister Mukuro or being in total despair mode and ruining the lives of everyone else. Now I will say there was one point in the show that was so dark it actually left me feeling pretty upset, since most of you should have played the 2nd game before watching this you should have known that a certain event will take place and let me just say this, prepare yourselves because I certainly was not but I do give the show props because they must be doing something right if they can make me feel this deeply about it.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end the show does a good job rapping this prequel story up and sets things up nicely to roll into the 1st games plot. Now while it did end things off nicely, that's not quite it for the story, for those who've been paying attention to the news you should already know but a new \"Hope\" arc has been announced and is said to be the end all of the story. Now that I am done with this I am definitely pretty hyped for the end of the story, although perhaps a little sad too having this big story come to an end that had me so captivated through out but all in all I do have high 'hope' for a great ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed the show, my fairly high expectations coming into this season were not let down. I guess I should also take quick note that the art is nothing special but certainly nothing bad and the music is great (aslong as you liked the soundtrack to the 2nd game that is). To anyone who enjoys the games even a little I highly recommend you watch this anime!",

A lot ofit is just exposition with meager attempts to convey emotion via mundane dialogues, lacking in any sense of stakes or scale and full of cliches. The characters are treated as plot device and less as actual human beings, those of class 77 especially. The anime spends most of its time holding our hands through every bit of detail in the story, expecting us to not be able to pick them up ourselves. Frankly, I had this issue with the games as well, but it wasn't nearly as apparent then.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime appears to be a show of a turn-of-events and just that; history. Scenes are drawn out past their relevance and feel pointless where they could've been used to build characters past what we already know about them. The story rises with mostly slow pacing to a dissatisfying payoff, and most of the enjoyment was makeshift inside my head by analyzing the story and characters way past what the anime could've possibly intended.\\n\\n\r\nExpect cheap animations, sub-par screenplay, nice but underused characters, and some classic DR fanservice. If you're not into DR, why bother. If you've played or read DR material before, treat this as a 12-episode cutscene instead. It'll give you some closure to questions and loose ends you probably have, but that's the only incentive I can think of.\\n\\n\r\nLoved the opening song though. Also <3 Junko xoxo",

Asahina, Naegi, had a past, they were in Danganronpa 1, (It was the best) and this one was.. very hard to feel for the characters, Kirigiri's death had me emotional (sorry if it was a spoi- wait, if you haven't watched chapter one then shoo. But heres my ratings;\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nCharacter: 1 \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nWorst Chapter yet.\\n\r\nOkay, heres explaining time, filled with spoilers, you've been warned.\\n\r\nMk- so this chapter was set before the whole killing with Junko thing, like how you see it in the first chapter, you see, the first chapter was based on the new killing game, in the big freakin' building and such, while this is set before that, you remember when --Ohh whats his name, ahh you know him, big, skinny, short white hair dude who tried to kill Naegi, yeah,him. he was explaining Yomizona or whatever her name was, her death, and how Despair was her fault, ahh I forgot most of it but bare with me, the reason the blood is pink is because Junko is still alive, and her theme is art, poppy, flashy stuff, also it's taken place before the new killing game, chapter one, with red blood, as Junko isn't in charge. But shit I am disappointed in this chapter, I wanted main characters, :( Everytime I want a ship going these amazing people sit there like \"Dhuuur letz kill dem guyz mk?\" Not well done on their side. :/",

            "content": "(Spoilers for the Danganronpa games) As half of the Danganronpa 3 anime experience, Side Despair's purpose is to provide backstory for Side Future as well as fill in Super Danganronpa 2's blanks. Neither should should be watched without playing the first two games in the series, but with Despair's final episode over with I can in good conscience say that they shouldn't be watched at all.\r\nSide Despair's problem is that it's boring, safe, predictable, and pointless. As a companion piece to Side Future it does its job fairly well, but in every other regard it's an absolute failure. Danganronpa and Super Danganronpa 2 left severalquestions unanswered, mysteries left up to one's interpretation. DR3 Side Despair aims to solve these riddles and provide answers to what exactly happened to Class 77 before SDR2's events.\\n\\n\r\nThis was a terrible idea.\\n\\n\r\nClass 77's backstory is largely shoved to the background in favour of crossovers with Side Future and an insider's view of series antagonist Junko Enoshima's infernal machinations. When the time finally comes for their big defining moment, none of them have had the development to warrant it. Instead, aside from outliers Nagito Komaeda, Chiaki Nanami, Ryota Mitarai and the Ultimate Impostor, all of them are mushed into one entity. Class 77 is no longer a cast of different characters, but one singular plot device the series has been chained to. Most of the Class 77 segments is spent building up to the demise of the one student missing in SDR2, and when it finally hits it's neither impactful nor entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nJunko Enoshima herself has also lost all of her charm. In the games, she appeared only at the very end of DR1 and SDR2. Now she's a main character in Side Despair, and it really hammers home the point that she's best used sparingly. In short, she's just not a very interesting character when you get down to it. She's evil because she's evil, and every single one of her evil plans always goes off without a hitch. What she ends up doing to plunge the world into despair is also incredibly stupid and hokey. The charismatic supervillain who capped off both games on their victory laps is now an omnipresent, transparently evil mwahahaer with little to do or say except ensure that all of SDR2's major backstory beats are hit. The one shining beacon of hope is one of the new anime-original guys, Juzo Sakakura, an excellently written character with a compelling and tragic arc. However, most of his big moments happen in Side Future, though vital setup occurs in Side Despair. Juzo is one of the best additions to the series yet, and his presence alone saves the show from being scored even lower.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I liked SDR2 better when I didn't actually know what happened before it. Every answer we get in Side Despair is far lamer than what I'd envisioned, and just about every character is cheapened by the Persona 4-esque herd treatment. Just about the only character who escaped mostly unscathed was Komaeda, and even he, who was THE defining driving force of SDR2, ended up underutilised and mostly there to provide context for Side Future's events. This show not only fails on its own, but it serves to also make SDR2 a much weaker story once you know just how uninteresting its backstory is.\\n\\n\r\nSide Despair is woefully written and dreadfully directed. The animation is also clearly low budget, with the excellent music and voice work, as usual for the franchise, being its only saving graces. You probably already watched this if you're a hardcore fan of the series, but I recommend everyone else give this a skip. Side Future is undoubtedly the stronger show of the two, though even then it'd hard to recommend that one either.",

            "content": "As a major fan of this series, I was expecting this anime to conclude the story for the three games and this arc was a surprise to many as we got a prequel of the second game to explain many mysteries involving the characters and the entire plot for the rest of the games. \r\nSadly, there's a huge problem when, instead of giving you answers or even more questions, this anime leaves you with contradictions about what you already experienced in the games. \r\nDanganronpa 3: The end of Hope's Peak Academy - Despair Side falls into this situation repeatedly. The selling point of this workis, as shown in their PV, the evolution of the 77th class into despair. They're barely present in the series. Barely. And they were the selling point. \\n\\n\r\nThe development about the characters we all knew and love is null, there's nothing to add into what the games already showed us and at points it contradicts what you have done in the games. \\n\r\nThe pace of the writing is wonky at best, with jumps in time that aren't explained of make sense in the huge timeline of the franchise, there's fanservice just to cover up the huge plotholes this anime leaves and it doesn't feel like it's a gift for the fans who have played this game for more than 4 years. \\n\\n\r\nJust as an example: The final scene from this anime in the credits contradicts the very five minutes you play into SDR2. And that isn't supposed to happen if you're going for a ground-breaking project like this and expect to make people who are already more than familiar with the story be angry or nitpicky because of the poor attention to detail. \\n\\n\r\nThe few things that save this anime is the music, which is very nice in both Op/End and their OST, the voice acting which is top notch and the appearance of the Despair Twins and their dynamics and also the dynamics between the Future Foundation main Trio. \\n\r\nThe protagonist and focus of this arc is weak, the introduction of a fan favourite to turn her into the mere shadow she was in the games for a plot device is simply insulting and her classmates are barely in there. Other than Impostor and Health Committee member, no one else gets development in a refreshing way or have any weight in the plot. \\n\\n\r\nAs an advice I recommend to not be hype about this anime if you're a die hard fan of the series or do it as me: Play the three games in a row, then sit to watch this; because you'll notice all the plotholes and contradictions and you'll be more focused into that than the entire story they poorly presented. \\n\\n",

            "content": "\"This is a tale of hope that ends in despair\"\r\nThese are the words that were spoken in the very beginning of this entry. A tale about the bright and talented students of Hopes Peak Academy's 77th Class. This entry explains what happened to SDR2's cast and everything about the Biggest, Most Atrocious Despair-Inducing Incident in Human History. A great prequel to the Danganronpa series.\r\nIf you're interested in watching this, you have to go back to the start of this series as this is the third entry from this series and watching this without knowledge of prior entries will confuse you and you wont get thefull enjoyment out of this entry, not to mention it will also spoil the events of SDR1 and 2. If you have knowledge then the watch order would be episode 1 of Side:Future, then episode 1 of Side:Despair and continue that pattern with the finale being Side:Hope. Remember, this review will contain minor and major spoilers of SDR1 and 2, you have been warned.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off with the 77th Class of Hopes Peak Academy and re-introduces them to us, it starts off fairly light and there's lots of comedic moments you can enjoy with your favorite characters from SDR2 while it foreshadows future events that you already know of. The story elegantly ties in with Side:Future as it gives us backstories of the cast from Side:Future as well. I thought every detail was explained well and even if certain things weren't explained at all, it still happened without visual presentation. I wont call it a plot hole as this is not the case. Unfortunately the show loves to go either with a slow pace or a very fast pace which is a minor setback. There were lots of controversies on how the 77th Class (and reserve course) fell into despair but I found it was the only reasonable explanation. So in conclusion I thought it explained the Biggest, Most Atrocious Despair-Inducing Incident in Human History quite well and we saw how everything happened, the first killing game was handled brilliantly, the events leading up to the major ones was done great. All in all the story tied in every entry in this series.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first episode we are introduced to a certain likable character from SDR2 and many were surprised about it because of the events of SDR2. This character is Chiaki Nanami and she's a bit different from SDR2, certain traits were kept but a few things were different about this character which makes sense if you know the whole story about her. Here this character is more perfect than the game version, but more human than in the game which is ironic since she was an AI. All the other characters are the same but the designs are slightly different, but they are all still excellent. We also get to see how Junko plays with Hopes Peak Academy and how she did everything, it's quite nice to see her in action as it really gives me more feeling to her character. Mukuro and Izuru are also present and you can see the love the former has for Junko and despair while the latter is a great written character who is quite tragic in my eyes. I will cover Side:Future's characters in Side:Future's review.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't anything amazing or mind-blowing nor is the animation, it's well done, but nothing overly bad or overly good, there were some scenes which were really well done in the animation and art department but other than that it wasn't anything special.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 6\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is simply amazing, as per usual in the Danganronpa franchise, they played the right tracks at the right time and it was just amazing. The voice acting was high tier as well, how can the voice acting go wrong when you have that many talented actors for the characters? (Ah ultimate students get ultimate actors)\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nBeing a Danganronpa fan, this has obviously been a blast to me, there were one or two boring parts but other than that it was one hell of a ride and I wouldn't mind re-watching this in the years to come, it showed me scenes that I really wanted to see ever since the games told me about them and I'm very satisfied about this series.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show does have a few faults, I still think it was really good, a great anime that I recommend to any fan of the Danganronpa franchise, it's a must watch and I'll remember this one for a while just like the previous entries in this franchise.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------",

            "content": "First things first. You need the play the two DR games (DR 1, SDR2) to fully understand and enjoy the two DR3 anime. If you were a fan of the first installment of the Danganronpa anime, you'll love the games, so please, if you haven't so already, turn around and play those two games (or watch a walkthrough) for the best viewing possible. DR: Another Episode is also mandatory especially for Future arc. Also be sure to watch both Future and Despair arc in broadcast order (i.e. watch future arc ep 1 then watch despair arc ep 1, and so on). There are parts wherethe story and characters might overlap, so be sure to watch it like that for better understanding.\\n\\n\r\nDR3: Despair arc is essentially a prologue to the DR story. It centers around the 77th class of the Hope's Peak acadmey, who btw are the main cast of the 2nd game: SDR2. The setting, once so happy and carefree, turns into one of the darkest points in their history: a prologue to the Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic event in human history. As the title and premise says, don't expect a happy ending to this. Although it starts off like your typical slice of life school anime, there is a brooding tone that constantly evolves as the episodes contiunously progress, awaiting to become a monster that destroys the students daily lives with despair. This tone starts as lighthearted then transitions into a darker mood, eventually becoming something outright disturbing. Suddenly, the happy, slice of life school setting is no more, instead it becomes violent, bloody and despair-inducing.\\n\r\nOne thing I liked is that they didn't linger or focus too much into the events the game already touched to an extent, like the Twilight Syndrome case. Just showing things in Hajime's point of view, and that was the better thing to do for the series.\\n\r\nOne thing I would've liked was to see the 78th class just a bit more than a cameo, like their original interactions with Junko, but with the anime being just 1 cour, it's understandable that they had to leave that out. \\n\r\nA disappointing isssue was that he pacing is a noticeably off. I feel like 11 episodes for the 77th class wasn't enough in the end. If it could have gotten a little bit more time, and cut a little bit more of the fanservice, I think the whole tragedy and the aftermaths could have been done better.\\n\r\n(SPOILERS: For example, the scene of \"her\" death and the 77 class turning into despair could have used an in-between scene. Maybe one that goes more in-depth of how the class fully submitted to Junko. The skip between the death scene and the finale was too sudden, considering the two were a couple months apart.)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the characters are really fun to watch as a fan. Just seeing all those characters I loved so much from the 2nd game animated is just so exciting. I felt that one good touch was that as episodes progress and tends to get darker, the art itself progresses to a more darker mood along with the story. Even the opening changes during the middle, to a much more darker color. It was a very nice touch to have, considering what was coming. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP/ED is pretty good, and the soundtracks were decent, although it could've been better. One thing I did like is how they used some game soundtracks for good nostalgia. The voice acting is fantastic as usual though, just like the games. The voices fit so well with the characters, which always helps the experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important part of the despair arc (and the rest of the danganronpa series in general) are without a doubt the characters. If I didn't care for the characters, I would never have felt anything for them and thus I probably wouldn't have cared what happened to them. Now, since the most of the cast were fleshed out pretty well in SDR2, it wasn't that hard to make me like them from the get go. However, one thing I would've liked to see is just making the cast even stronger. I know that Chiaki, Hinata, and Nagito are indeed the important characters, but I also would've liked those without too much game time from SDR2 to get a bit more exposure and development, like Teruteru and Mahiru to an extent. What I'm glad though, is the screen time the Ultimate Imposter got. Anyways, even if some characters are not getting the desirable screen time, they are still enjoyable to watch. This is also an important reason to play the games before watching this. You just get to know the characters better and smile as they are finally interacting cheerfully without being forced to kill each other. And of course, feel a lot more sadness when they are forced to go through \"that process\". However, one thing that I am really glad Despair arc managed was Mukuro and Junko getting a bit more depth, as well as Mitarai.\\n\r\nOne thing I didn't really like though, was how it put focus on the future arc characters for a couple of episodes, halting potential DR0 scenes and even halting the depth of the characters and their downfall. It's a shame that the despair process did not go as I imagined thanks to this, as I would've preferred the \"despairification\" process to be on a more personal level. Having more than 11 episodes would have helped.\\n\\n\r\nAs a huge fan of the danganronpa series, I feel both love and disappointment with the DR 3. On one hand, I loved seeing the characters I loved so much animated, interacting with each other. Even the first two episodes which were basically fan service was enjoyable to watch. Although honestly, they could have made the slice-of-life moments shorter just so we could've had more plot development earlier on. And on the other hand there were pacing issues, like I've mentioned. Also, the despair arc is also a big 'what could have been'. What if they would have personalized the despairification process? I think that would have been a better way to showcase and further the depth of both the characters and how they became \"despair\". Nonetheless, I had this huge smile while watching the first couple of episodes, only for it to turn to sadness and eventually into complete anxiousness as I knew what would eventually happen to the cast. It could have been much better, in fact, after rewatchign the series a couple of times, I just feel disappointed in how the revelation of how the 77th class turned into despair. It's still a fine watch.\\n\r\nGive the entire series (games + anime) a try! It's definitely worth your time.",

            "content": "As Danganronpa fans, we only get to hear stories about the high-school life of the characters and how \u201cThe Tragedy\u201d happened, but we never actually get to see that. But with Danganronpa 3 \u2013 Zetsubou-hen, we get just that. Zetsubou-hen takes place prior to the events of the first Danganronpa game, primarily focusing on 77th class of the main course and their story about how they became the \u201cRemnants of Despair\u201d. Labeled as a story that begins with hope but ends in despair, it definitely won\u2019t have a happy end. But this is a treat for Danganronpa fans as they get the happy moments oftheir favorite character, until all hell breaks loose. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nDespite being titled as Danganronpa 3, it is actually a prequel to the first game. However, it is meant to be watched after playing the second game as it spoils the plot twists of Danganronpa 2. Being a prequel however, you will already what will happen and how it\u2019ll end. But the sole purpose of this anime is to show you how it happened. The story focuses on the 77th class (the main cast of Danganronpa 2) and their life at Hope's Peak Academy. But the story focuses on our Danganronpa 2 protagonist, Hinata Hajime, and how he tries to find himself a talent. The story also focuses on the new characters that were introduced in Mirai-hen and give more background for them. And as you\u2019ve probably predicted, it doesn\u2019t take too long for Despair to appear with Enoshima creating the \u201cRemnant of Despair\u201d and \u201cKamukura Izuru Project\u201d taking place. Overall, the story is handle very well and it remain \u201calmost\u201d consistent with what we\u2019ve heard before about \u201cThe Tragedy\u201d. The reason why I say \u201calmost\u201d is because there are some things Monokuma/Enoshima told us before that don\u2019t quite happen in Zetsubou-hen. But then again, they were Enoshima\u2019s words\u2026 you can\u2019t really trust that, can you? \\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nZetsubou-hen is the Danganronpa you know and love. It starts off in a happy tone, similar to the fun moments for the second game. But then despair kicks in, which is to be expected from anything Danganronpa related. One thing that is well-done in Zetsubou-hen is how the writers manage to remember so many tiny details mentioned in the second game and apply them to this anime. Remember Tanaka saying something about defeating a giant Pomeranian in his. If you don\u2019t remember, don\u2019t worry\u2026 the writers haven\u2019t forgotten. And they also applied Saionji\u2019s height change later in the series too. The first couple of episodes of the series is basically fanservice for the fan base. We get to see the Danganronpa 2 characters we know with their unique personalities being shown. We get to see the happy moments of the 77th class before \u201cthings\u201d happened. But the rest of the series is what fans expect from this prequel story; despair. The series has the same wacky and zany, yet dark and disturbing tone of its predecessors. The pacing can be a bit too fast as times, but that was to be expected with the amount of plot points that needed to be covered.\\n\r\nPresentation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nZetsubou-hen primarily focuses on the 77th Class and Hinata Hajime prior to becoming the \u201cRemnant of Despair\u201d. The characterization for these characters are very similar to their characterization in the second game. Hinata\u2019s still kind of cynical, Nanami\u2019s still adorable, Komaeda\u2019s still kibou-sexual, Tanaka\u2019s still a chuunibyou, Souda\u2019s still pathetic, Mioda\u2019s still loud, Nidai still needs to take a dump, Saionji\u2019s still a b*tch, and so on. Zetsubou-hen is very loyal with its characters and keeps them as how they\u2019re supposed to be. But out of these characters, Hinata, Nanami and Komaeda are the ones that play a bigger role, while the rest are mostly there as comic relief or just for the sake of the plot. Hinata\u2019s inferiority complex kicks in right when we get introduced to him and his accepting the Kamukura Project plays a big role in the series. His complexity is well handled when he\u2019s Hinata. When he\u2019s Kamukura, his more of a flat character, but that\u2019s how his character ends up being. Nanami, who\u2019s appearance was quite surprising since she was known to be simply an A.I. in the second game, plays a big role in this series too. And she ends up being the most unpredictable character since you actually don\u2019t know how things will end up for her. Komaeda is here quite a lot, though it may not always be for the sake of moving the plot, but because we get to see more of his ultimate ability, Ultimate Asspuller\u2026 I mean Ultimate Lucky Student. But Enoshima Junko\u2019s also a major character in the series, but that is too be expected since she is the conflict of the series. Zetsubou-hen also builds up on its Mirai-hen characters, like Yukizome and Munakata, and it\u2019s done pretty effectively. For that sole reason, it is meant to watch together with Mirai-hen.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe art in Zetsubou-hen is pretty good, but it\u2019s the art style that succeeds more. The art is fairly well detailed and the backgrounds are fairly well done. But the character designs are the most impressive. The characters in Danganronpa 2 all had quite unique character desings, and that same uniqueness can be found here. Some characters look slightly different, like how Tanaka\u2019s hair style is different. But the most notable thing is that the art style is very vivid, especially when compared to the franchise. This creates a contrast to Mirai-hen\u2019s darker-than-normal art style. This vivid art style might have been used to represent the hopefulness the series initially started with and this art style might\u2019ve been used as a contrast for the darker despair moments that comes later in the series. Overall, it was a pretty smart choice to go with an art style that contrast with Mirai-hen\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animations are fairly good in the series, but it isn\u2019t anything extraordinary. However, that is to say that the animation quality is fairly consistent throughout. Generally speaking, the animation is fluid enough and there aren\u2019t any noticeable animation quality drops. Backgrounds feel a little static though. However, the lighting helps in adding more volume to the visuals. Though if we compare the animation quality to Mirai-hen\u2019s it is a little weaker. But unlike Mirai-hen (which is more action-heavy), Zetsubou-hen doesn\u2019t have any demanding moments that needs high-quality animations. Lerche did a good job in animating two seasons during the same time, which they aren\u2019t used too. \\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast is the same as the games and Mirai-hen. All the well-known seiyuu are back to represent their character. Takayama Minami does the Danganronpa 2 protagonist, Hinata Hajime, and does him and his alternate personality, Kamukura Izuru, perfectly well. Ogata Megumi (the same seiyuu as Naegi Makoto), does Komaeda Nagito again, and she does his voice amazingly well. Just like Danganronpa 2, Ogata has time to shine and show her talent as a character like Komaeda. Hanazawa Kana reprises her role as Nanami Chiaki and does her character very well. Unlike her A.I. personality in Danganronpa 2, Nanami sounds a little less listless, but it matches her character more. Toyoguchi Megumi does both the Despair sisters, Enoshima Junko and Ikusaba Mukuro, and she does a great job with both, but her talent shines with Junko more. Nakahara Mai does a very good job as Yukizome Chisa. Her character didn\u2019t play a big role in Mirai-hen, but in Zetsubou-hen, she\u2019s one of the main characters. And other seiyuu such as Sugita Tomokazu, Kayano Ai, and Fukuyama Jun all do a great job with their characters. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nOne of Danganronpa\u2019s strong point is its music and Zetsubou-hen is no different. The OP, \u201cKami-iro Awase\u201d, didn\u2019t take too long to become one of my favorite anime openings. The music, the vocals, and the lyrics are amazing for the song. And there\u2019s a lot of symbolism in the song too. The ED, \u201cZettai Kibou Birthday\u201d, is sung by Komaeda\u2019s seiyuu and it\u2019s very good. The vocals and music are nice and it matches the tone of the hope in the series. The lyrics is quite weird\u2026 but so is Komaeda! Most of the background music consists of music used in the first two games, which is a good thing since the two games had some amazing music. The background music creates a sense of nostalgia due to its familiarity. Till this day, the closing argument theme is my favorite OST and every time I hear it, I always get a sense of joy from it! \\n\r\nMusic: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nAs a Danganronpa fan, this is exactly what I wanted out of Zetsubou-hen. It felt really nice to see the Danganronpa 2 characters again and see how their past was. As someone who always wanted to see how everything turned out the way it ended up to be, I was really satisfied that we were able to see that with this anime adaptation. This anime covers \u201cThe Kamukura Izuru Project\u201d, \u201cTwilight Syndrome Murder Case\u201d (albeit a little rushed), \u201cStudent Council Massacre\u201d, how the \u201cRemnant of Despair\u201d were created, and \u201cThe Tragedy\u201d. Though my rating for enjoyment is high, it\u2019s really hard to enjoy a series like this. You\u2019ll mostly just get despair from this series and a whole lot of tragedies. But Zetsubou-hen manages to keep my attention all of the time. Zetsubou-hen and Mirai-hen are easily one of the most enjoyable things I have watched this year. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Zetsubou-hen is definitely worth watching if you\u2019re a Danganronpa fan (though you probably already have).  Due remember though that Zetsubou-hen, despite it being a prequel chronologically wise, is meant to be watched after playing the first two game. Due note that you must play the second game in order to fully appreciate both Zetsubou-hen and Mirai-hen. Danganronpa\u2019s first game or its lackluster adaptation isn\u2019t enough. But with great handling of its characters, and satisfying adaptations of stories we were only told about in the previous games, Zetsubou-hen manages to be the perfect treat for fans. It may not be an easy watch due to depressing moments, but it manages to keep your attention. But that is to be expected since the it\u2019s a story that begins in hope and ends in despair.\\n\\n\r\n+ Great prequel anime for the Danganronpa series, that adapts many key plot-points that were mentioned in the games. \\n\r\n+ Danganronpa 2 characters are handled well and loyal to the second game.\\n\r\n+ Great OPs and EDs and the background music is the same as the games.\\n\r\n+ Not only develops its Danganronpa 2 characters, but also the characters from Mirai-hen too. \\n\r\n+ Lots of fun and satisfying moments for fans of the franchise. \\n\r\n- Pacing can get a tad bit too fast at times. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.0/10",

            "content": "*Spoilers ahead*\r\nNow this.. How should i put it... This is by far one of the worst anime i've ever watched. certainly in my top 10 worst list. The only things it has going for it is how it reveals a few very minor details, how well it worked along with the other arc, and that the visuals aren't too bad (They aren't even close to being good though). \r\nNow let's go through what makes this (and every other anime), and then sum up what we have. \r\n1-The plot. It is horrendous. I understand that it was set and there wasn't much room to work withit, but it still doesn't change the fact its bad. The internal logic falls apart quite often. Plot holes are absolutely everywhere. Plot convenience tools are used left and right. There was a story to tell somewhere in there, and it could have been interesting, but instead, it was just a rush job with only the final outcome in mind, and it ended up developing in the most boring, predictable and cliche way as possible.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we've got an introduction to our class of gifted individuals, yet it was extremely rushed and thus completely redundant - the fans of the game already know the characters well, and a new audience wouldn't have gotten much from such a tiny introduction. Another reason it was redundant is because... Well, its nothing new is it? I mean every second school anime has that in abundance, and that's not the point of the anime as well, so why waste time on it?\\n\\n\r\nNow for the character and their interaction with the story. The story IS the interaction of the characters with it. Yet, in this story, most of the characters where completely isolated from the story (You could say only Junko had a role in the whole anime), and everyone who did have a chance to do something or interact in any other way, was either a bystander, or had such a level of incompetence, that even a sock puppet would seem like a rich character next to him. You could pretty much replace every line of dialogue in the anime except Junko's with \"it can't be helped\" and not much would change. The saddest thing about it, is how the anime is trying to keep the story seem important, dark, and meaningful, by constantly jamming in death, and rubbing it in the viewer's face.\\n\\n\r\nThe art. Its ok, BUT, the level of detalization of characters was greatly diminished compared to the game, in some cases leaving characters almost unrecognizable. The sound is ok too, bot bad but nothing special as well. \\n\r\nSo, what do we have left? Well, nothing really. While i don't really believe in spoilers in the first place, the end of this one was spoiled to begin with, so while nothing else, i expected that to lower the score this anime gets further. I was rather surprised to see it got such a high rating instead. \\n\\n\r\nWell, now that you know my analysis of this.. Thing... And my opinion on it, feel free to agree or disagree, but please, don't give me baseless arguments and claims such as \"you're wrong cuz that's your opinion only\", or \"You're just hating\". I always analyze anime objectively by comparing it to others as well as consulting my knowledge of movie making and story writing that i got from filming school. Such accusations will simply be ignored due to their illogical nature - i found the other arc ok, and the adaptation of DR1 pretty decent after all.",

            "content": "Danganronpa 3 Despair has become divisive among the fanbase.  From expectations not being fulfilled to false advertising, a good portion of fans we're not satisfied with how the anime was handled.  On the other side of the spectrum, others believe it to be a great work that holds the franchise well.  Lastly, there are those in the middle that still enjoyed it but recognize it's flaws.  I'm also in the middle.  While I did enjoy this series, I also had many issues with it.\r\nFirst off, knowledge of both DR: Trigger Happy Havoc and Super DR2:  Goodbye Island of Despairare necessary.  Even going into this prequel, spoilers are abound right off the bat due to revelations as early as episode 1 spoil critical mysteries you won't find answers to until near the end of the game.  Also, Despair arc runs alongside Future arc, and episode order is one Future arc episode then Despair arc, watching both series simultaneously.  This issue should be brought up as soon as possible, as all the criticism of the anime stems from this format.\\n\\n\r\nThe false advertising I mentioned earlier is that while Despair arc's premise is about the 77th class of Hope's Peak Academy.  The POV starts and gives plenty of focus on a character from the Future arc, Chisa Yukizome.  While she first appears to bring the class together and bonding with them, the story shifts to her investigation about the hidden secrets of the school to the point it takes away time from the 77th class.  That's not all.  Other characters from the Future arc appear later, and get an amount of focus in relation to what's going on in the Future arc at the time.  The fact that no characters from Future arc were even hinted before in promotion materials to be in Despair arc led to the accusations of false advertisement and how Despair arc was used to provide more characterization to the characters from the Future arc that itself couldn't provide.  Two one cour series with each having many characters to focus on rarely gives consistent and equal characterization, and a good number of them will get be sidelined.  And while the attempt is creative, was it worth all the cutting corners in the narrative to fit these plotlines together.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the main characters, the 77th class, get relegated to being side characters in what was supposed to be their own story and get treated more as a collective than individuals.  Some exceptions are Hajime, Chiaki, Nagito and the Super High School Level Imposter, though very slightly, and for specific plot reasons.  Hajime has a adequate amount of characterization because a good deal of focus is on him in the beginning, but it only lasts a few episodes.  Those who played the game know the inevitable change that will befall him, and how he will be erased to make another character take his place for the rest of the series Izuru Kamukura.  This had fans hyped because of who this character was and that we would finally see him in action, but then grew dissatisfied as episodes passed and he rarely did anything.  Hajime who was an interesting character is replaced by Izuru who fans were hyped about, hoping he would play a big role, yet he merely serves as a walking plot device with no character.\\n\\n\r\nChiaki plays a key role that ultimately leads to one of the most divisive episodes of the anime.  The premise of the show is about the 77th class, and how they would later become a group Super High School Level Despair that destroy the world.  There were expectations built up from the second game on how the main antagonist Junko Enoshima managed to turn these beacons of hope into envoys of despair.  The way it was executed left much to be desired, and it's in part due to the existence of another character from the Future arc,  Ryota Mitarai.   This one character is so deeply entrenched in both storylines that many of the decisions for DR3 as a whole was based around him, making him a divisive character.  Chiaki was meant to play the role of the hope of the 77th class, and in order to turn the rest of the 77th class to despair, she was doomed to die.  Ryota was to provide the means to help the transformation, a brainwashing anime.  The characterization of the Super High School Level Imposter is also mainly dependent on this character as well, forming a give and take relationship with him that later becomes friendship.\\n\\n\r\n77th class as a whole already got relegated to being side characters in their own series that their characters as individuals were already diminished, but now the way they're converted, what's supposed to be the focal point of the series, is the same lazy way as a group like some kind of hive mind.   Those who played the games know they aren't just a class of students.  We know they have their own backstories, characteristics (not just the ones used for comedy), and ambitions that made them each who they are.  To have that all tossed aside and have them be treated as a single entity is disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, the format is a huge factor, but also, the way it was executed and how it fits in the narrative have problems.  I mentioned before that viewers need to know the storylines of both games before watching.  That could not be anymore true.  You could not hope to understand even half of what goes on in this series without that knowledge, and even then you have to stretch your imagination on how things progress and how it connects to the games.\\n\\n\r\nImportant events are also condensed to one episode, incidents with enough material that could have been made each into their own series.  One example is one of the most brutal events in the series, the first killing game.  If the purpose was to freak the audience out, it succeeded.   However, once you calm down and start evaluating what happened,  you realize that what happened didn't make any sense.  The 16 students weren't captured; they were summoned.  Even when threatened that if they didn't play they would die, the threat diminishes when the ones doing the threatening leave the room.  Junko gives them all sorts of weapons, and only one of the students suggest using them against their coercers, and he promptly gets killed soon after by another of his fellow classmates.  After that, mostly everyone just degrades and start becoming sadistic killers for no reason other than to hammer in the nightmare fuel.  They weren't locked in, had options outside of killing each other, and were left with means that could have just as easily been used to defend themselves and escape rather than turn on each other, but because this must end in tragedy and in such a short time span, the characters have to move the story along no matter what.  In the same vein, afterwards, the school just covers it up, because the board of directors are generic one-dimensional scumbags and Junko can't be caught yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe same line of thought goes into Junko's motivations.  Why did she particular choose the 77th class to begin with?  You never get an answer other then her just being fickle about it.  How did she notice Ryota provided the means for her agenda?  She just had a feeling.  You always get a half-baked answer or no answer at all.  Being a prequel means the main plot points are all foregone conclusions.  However, this point is taken to nauseously exploitative handling.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Mikan goes missing after being captured by Mukuro and has been brainwashed.  The other classmates split up and go search for her even with riots going on outside.  Nagito and Chiaki find the secret room Junko had Ryota held up in by Nagito using his luck, in which has them meeting Izuru and Junko as well, Ryota escaping and running into Chisa, Nagito getting injured and Chisa intervening.  Mukuro was being kept occupied by Peko who Nagito requested she distract her.  How he knows about Mukuro or anything that's been going on with Junko is left unanswered.  Chisa volunteers to stay behind for no good reason, and that leads to Chiaki to carry Nagito back to their classroom where everyone else is, excluding Peko.\\n\\n\r\nNext, Chiaki comes up with the brilliant idea of everyone going together to save Chisa to which they all inevitably agree.  During which Mikan who was missing suddenly returns with Peko who got injured.  You expect since she was the reason everyone was searching for initially, they would ask where she's been and why she's been absent.  No, they don't inquire anything about that. They head towards Chisa who has now been captured and brainwashed.\\n\\n\r\nOn the way, they encounter rioters just outside the gate that is now open for some reason, and there is no security around.  It takes a very special kind of lazy to have this, because in previous scenes, the gates were closed, guards were struggling keeping them out, and you get atleast two scenes of that.  Now, no one is there except the rioters and not only that, they immediately resort to cold-blooded murder.  They were angry before, but here, they are calm, quiet and slowly walk up to Chiaki and everyone.  Nekomaru and Gundham stay behind to deal with them.  Chiaki takes them to the secret passageway, where Mikan manages to separate her from everyone else through convenient trap doors and when the others wonder why she's missing, they accept Mikan's excuse that she's wasn't \"feeling well and rested in a room they previously passed\".  Nevermind, she was well just a moment ago, also how that contrasted with her determination shown earlier, and you know, the fact this is enemy territory! Nekomaru and Gundham catch up at this time, getting the location from Mikan.  Chiaki wakes up to find Chisa who lies that Izuru helped her escape, and they decide to meet up with the rest of the class.  From then on, well, it goes as well as you'd expect...\\n\\n\r\nChiaki's death made me sad but it wasn't as tearjerking as it could have been.   All of her exploits of keeping the class together were just told to us and mostly off screen.  The build up to her execution was poor by having everyone passing around the idiot ball to have plot happen.  Also throughout it all, I couldn't hold back my disbelief on how Junko managed to configure all those traps and build the trial room all in the span of at least days, and none of the authoritative figures in the school or the board of directors noticed, either because they will either ignore it anyway or are grossly incompetent.\\n\\n\r\nI mean I liked all the continuity nods and fanservice provided, but that's not enough to hold the story together.  When it came to the Despair arc, the fanservice and establishing ties to the Future arc were more important than telling a coherent story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I also liked was the portrayal of Junko and the resulting disillusionment for a good portion of the fanbase.  Another aspect I believe this series intended to do was really hammer home how Junko is a irredeemable character.  Mukuro was also disillusioned to many.\\n\\n\r\nDespair arc has fanservice and hit-or-miss humor going for it.  Many things happen because they need to and not if it makes any sense.  The format really limited the series as there was simply not enough time to expand on all the plot points, resulting in too much going on at once and not enough focus on the main characters, the ones the story should mainly be about.",

            "content": "As a fan of the Danganronpa games, specially the second one, I was quite looking forward to this anime. I wanted to see more about the main cast of SDR2 and learn about how they fell to despair. \r\n[This review may contain spoilers]\r\nIn my honest opinion, if it weren't for the simultaneous weekly release along with Future Arc, I think this anime would've felt way weaker. That was the purpose, after all. While it still felt a bit weak to me, I did enjoy it. I do think this anime greatly surpassed the first installment in the anime adaptations for the series. \r\nAs for thestory, we mostly knew the basics. We knew how it would go down. Starting from a slice of life, sliding into a despairful mess of chaos. What I definitely mostly enjoyed was the change into the actual title of the series - DESPAIR. However, it escalated rather quickly which made it feel less realistic, but since they had to tuck in a lot of content in such a small amount of episodes, I won't pay that much attention to that detail. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the strong point from Danganronpa are its characters. It managed to get me attatched to the new characters. The introduction of the trio investigating (Munakata, Sakakura, Chisa - being her the narrator) Hope's Academy was a good thing and created a refreshing contrast between their point of view and the students'. Also, it painted the academy in a whole new light. However this also was the cause of how apart and plain the main cast from SDR2 felt. They barely got focused (with some exceptions) on and almost felt like supporting characters. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, what mostly bugged me was how Nanami was created as a real person for the anime. While at the start it was well handled, it all went down and became a bit disappointing when she just literally became a tool for Junko. Coming from SDR2, I was expecting Junko to act like Junko and destroy every characters individually, or at least more slowly than how it went down on the anime. This both made Junko's and Nanami's character feel more lazy than they actually are. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was okay and I specially enjoyed the remakes of the original tracks from the games. It made it feel more like Danganronpa. Both OP&ED were really great and really well handled in the smallest details. The original tracks from the anime weren't specially outstanding or memorable, so I wouldn't say the music was one of the strongest points of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation: I am really picky and critical about this point. While they did a good job with the colors (contrasting with the dark palette of Future Arc) - something that gradually changed along with the tone of the anime-, the animation could've been way better. The movement was really not fluid and most of the time it felt kind of awkward. This is completely a biased opinion but I feel that the animes never really imitated Rui Komatsuzaki's art that well. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, as a whole I really enjoyed the anime. I'm still a fan and did get emotional with my favorite characters and even the new characters. It's better than the first anime and even if it has some weak points it's definitely worth watching if you're a fan of the games.",

            "content": "Welcome to the last week of this year's horror anime month. In order to wrap things up, let's look at the other instalment of Danganronpa 3, Zetsubou-hen. Is it an improvement over the other half of Danganronpa 3, just as weak or worse? I suppose the only way to find out is to watch and determine for ourselves. So, let's take a look.\r\nStory:\r\nZetsubou-hen opens with Yukizome taking a teacher's role at Hope's Peak Academy as part of an investigation into the Academy's more shady pursuits. She's assigned to the 77th class and begins her work in earnest, both as a teacher and an investigator. Allwhile events are moving towards the great world-changing event of ultimate despair.\\n\\n\r\nTherein lies the biggest flaw with the series. If you saw the first Danganronpa, you know how it's going to end. Even if you haven't, the series itself calls it a tale of hope that ends in despair. Which could work, if they built up some tension in another way. But the series never bothers. About half of it is spent on vaguely slice of life school life with very minor references to Yukizome's investigation. Then we get a bunch of episodes setting up Junko's machinations. Most of the series is just build up to a pretty disappointing climax. To make matters worse, if you happen to have watched Mirai-hen first, like I did, then you'll know the exact plot points to expect. The series also shares Mirai-hen's weakness of having a lot of bad, over-blown speeches. The only difference is that the ones in Zetsubou-hen are mostly about despair instead of hope.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I do appreciate what the series was trying to do. When it comes right down to it, it's trying to humanise the group that Naegi got called a traitor for protecting. It's trying to get you to connect with and understand them. There's just one problem with that. Let's talk about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe Danganronpa series in general isn't good at providing compelling characters. The first anime got around that by providing good mysteries. The Mirai-hen part of Danganronpa 3 tried to do the same, but ended up spending too much time with strangely absurd action sequences and puerile hope speeches. This series doesn't even have that to fall back on. We know that Junko's the villain as soon as she shows up. We see what Hope's Peak is up to before there's much investigation into it. We know that things are going to end in despair. So, what we're left with are shallow archetypical characters who spend the bulk of the series doing nothing interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs continue to be a weakness. Although this may be the part of the series that's least effected by it since a good half of it is about the students just being students. The series does have a strange habit of making the non-important characters just look like blue humanoid blobs. Maybe they didn't want normal looking people and they didn't want to bother coming up with stupid looking designs for background characters. I will credit this series for having bloody sequences that are fairly competent. Although they do use bizarre neon colouring for it. Maybe they were on a time slot where they couldn't show much blood so they worked around it by making the blood not look like blood.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThis is one area where I have to give every instalment of this franchise credit. They are good at casting. Ogata Megumi, Hanazawa Kana, Toyoguchi Megumi, Takayama Minami & Nakahara Mai are all good in this. In spite of their characters lacking any real complexity. Really, none of the actors do a bad job. They're all basically competent. The music is also decent enough.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere's a bit. Junko's sister seems to have a thing for her. I have no idea why they included that, but it's there. The photographer has a girl that she seems to have a thing with. The chef is openly bisexual and it's revealed that a certain gent is in love with another man. That being said, this stuff barely comes up and is, mostly, not important to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's Danganronpa 3: Zetsubou-hen. Ultimately, its big failing is that its whole raison d'etre is to get you invested in bland characters. In the interest of doing so, it lacks mystery and has very little that could be charitably called horror. If you're a big fan of the franchise and you really want to see the events that built up to the grand hyper worst despair-inducing situation, you might find it interesting. Maybe. For myself, I'm going to give it a 3/10. While it is pretty bad, there's nothing truly terrible about it. Next week I'll open November with a review of 91 Days. Have a happy Halloween and retain your fabulousity.",

            "content": "LA is gonna change up the format for this review as well as Mirai-hen by making it a sorta of 3-parter due to the nature of how Danganronpa 3's animes were presented so if you wanted to see LA's take on Mirai-hen and Kibou-hen then this review won't be in it.\r\nBefore LA talks about Zetsubou-hen, LA will say that both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen anime are something of a companion piece with each other giving off clues or events that transpired that lead it to how or when it happened. The obvious companion piece both these anime have is \"trying to find the traitor\" and whysome of the founders are butting heads with each other in Mirai-hen and \"how Danganronpa's franchise started\" as well as some backstory on some of the newer characters in Mirai-hen for Zetsubou-hen and both arcs gives and feeds information to each other. For anime-episode order, you should/MUST watch by starting with Mirai-hen's episode then Zetsubou-hen episode then back and forth after that for \"clarity\". Once both Mirai-hen and Zetsubou-hen have finished finishing with Mirai-hen's final episode go to Kibou-hen for the finale. Ohh and MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!...don't say LA didn't warn you! \\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way\\n\\n\r\nZetsubou-hen is at first vastly different from Mirai-hen being a bit more of a slice of life comedy highschool anime with all the eccentric characters and the daily lives of the Ultimates in Hope Peak High, but considering the obvious that this season is called \"Despair arc\"...you know that the atmosphere will drastically change.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, well if remembering the characters in Danganronpa 2, then the entire cast of 77B is back and this and more or less the first half of this anime is pure fanservice. But from this, Chiaki Nanami voiced by Kana Hanazawa, Chisa Yukizome, Hajime Hinata voiced by Minami Takayama, Nagito Komaeda voiced by Megumi Ogata as well as many of the more important newer characters from Mirai-hen do get their character development/backstory given to them in this arc, mostly because this is a prequel to the game, it's to be expected that there would be some form of development to the characters that mattered and caused what occurred in the game. Even saying it's a prequel really doesn't harm Zetsubou-hen though as LA said earlier it's fanservice to even see the characters in Danganronpa 2 animated. But one little problem comes in which is although we get mostly comedic fanservice from most of the main cast of Zetsoubou-hen mainly 77B, the focus to Zetsubou-hen goes more to the \"more important and plot forward\" characters (Hajime, Izuru Kamukura, Nagito, The Enoshima Twins, Juzo, Munakata, Chisa and Ryota to be precise) as well as giving us clarity with little subtle nods to Mirai-hen's ordeal with their newer characters as a bit of bonus (and more clue finding for Mirai-hen's part) like Seiko, Izayoi and Ruruka's own \"episodes\" and Juzo, Munakata and Chisa in detail MUCH later on. But if there was a flaw with Zetsubou-hen being a prequel is that if you've played Danganronpa 2...the prequel will ultimately leave them to their doom...*ahem* despair, the plot pre-ordianed them to this and the flaw can massively hurt as you just know they will end up like they were in the game, Class of 77B were effectively comedic fanservice until the plot told them \"they were important to move the plot forward and destined to how they become in the game\". If there was a favorite character in Zetsubou-hen it goes to Junko Enoshima, but as for the Ultimates...LA was always fond of Sonia Nevermind voiced by Miho Arakawa and Akane Owari voiced by Romi Park in the game and Chiaki Nanami voiced by Kana Hanazawa deserves top billing in the Ultimates however and it obviously was transferred into the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, well in contrast to Mirai-hen's bleaker animation palette, Zetsoubou-hen's color palette is definitely brighter and vibrant as a disguise as to what kind of despair is gonna happen sooner or later, from gaming homages and little 8-Bit vers. of the Zetsubou-hen cast to just the vibrant character designs to turn it into the dull, bleaker blood-red tinge of Mirai-hen. Ohh and the pink blood is back in Zetsubou-hen in all it's gory ahh LA means glory and it does get GORY. The animation may be \"ok\" but Zetsubou-hen can sure bring in it's aesthetic value and GORY detail when it really starts getting intense, sure the animation is slightly inconsistent but it's aesthetic detail to the later episodes makes up for that IMMENSELY.\\n\\n\r\nEssentially Zetsubou-hen is Danganronpa fanservice as well as backstory for nearly every single thing that happened in the series (as well as from Mirai-hen's characters) as a well defined prequel, which means yes, we get to see the The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History as well as how Hope Peak's Academy actually functioned before AND AFTER Junko Enoshima came in. There are ALOT of Danganronpa homage fanservice here and there which HELPS SOOO MUCH and for *ahem* ecchi fanservice, well if you like it of not Episode 2 and 7 is there if you want it. *cough* aphrodisiac curry *cough* Nagito *cough*\\n\\n\r\nAAAAND on speaking of Junko Enoshima, if there was anything LA could say about this eccentrically schizophrenic villain in the series is that she is most probably one of the greatest villains in anime, not only for her personality and pure nihilist tendencies but for what lengths she will go to for what she wants, she is one of the thee smartest, calculating, bizarrely cold hearted and eccentric villains in anime LA has seen and Zetsubou-hen shows it as raw as possible...why does LA utterly praised Junko?...well not only does she take LA's favourite character in Zetsubou-hen (Or LA is an Ultimate Despair...LA really does love the pure insane eccentric villains, why do you think LA put Nui Harime in LA's favourite characters list?) but Junko's craving for nihilism/despair as all the rest a la order is boring is a best if LA could say this as an analogy...like the Joker from the Dark Knight Trilogy. Why?...well sure you could easily say that it's quite obvious as both Junko and Joker have the same belief system. Nihilism. But even their methods are the same!. (Sorry for the tangent but this was bottled in LA and LA might as well say it now). Let's see Junko essentially toppled a hierarchy of Hope Peaks Academy by finding out all the funds from the Reserve Course was used essentially to fund human experimentation, thus breaking the order of Hope......Peak Academy, then using Izuru Kamakura the \"Ultimate Hope\" into \"despair\" by blaming the The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History on Izuru and by the end of it Izuru will see which one is harder to predict, hope or despair?. The Joker?...tried to cause chaos ultimately destroying the foundation of Gotham City and using Harvey Dent as the pinnacle of hope in Gotham and make Harvey believe that the order of Gotham needs to change...like adopt the Joker's anarchy thus becoming Two-Face. Junko Enoshima is to the Joker, as Izuru Kamakura is to Harvey Dent. <LA sighs>...Juuko Enoshima is a great villain ain't she???...aaand LA watched the Dark Knight too much.\\n\\n\r\nOk ok back on topic...what was next ohhh right! In terms of voice acting, just like Mirai-hen, we've got an excellent voice cast with reprisals from the Danganronpa 2 game at that and even though LA only watched a Let's Play of Danganronpa 2 in English on Youtube, still the Japanese voice cast is AMAZING from Kana Hanazawa to Yuu Koyabashi to Romi Park and Ai Kayano to heck even Kotono Mitsuishi. But quite eaisly, best voice actor in Zetsubou-hen goes to Megumi Toyoguchi as Junko Enoshima AND Mukuro Ikusaba as the Despair Twins.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending brought up some plot holes that just wasn't told which was a problem and really MANY things in Zetsubou-hen was retconned but considering many of the other Dangaronpa materials LA hasn't consumed yet (Danganronpa Zero etc.) so LA can take a few liberties towards it due to Zetsubou-hen bringing in some of the other material into homages to itself, but the ONLY plot hole LA really couldn't oversee is with Chiaki *MAJOR SPOILERS* and for those who have watched it, it's obvious what LA is gonna talk about, it is if Chiaki died by Junko's execution plans, Zetsubou-hen NEVER tells us how a \"real-flesh character\" like Chaiki gets turned into AI and goes into the Neo World Program, like did Chiaki plan something before it, did one of the Mirai-hen characters upload her or created her...it was NEVER explained. Nonetheless Zetsubou-hen being a prequel and bringing in a per-determined ending and with that one major plot hole, LA was still ok with this, a bit annoyed but ok.\\n\\n\r\nZetsubou-hen may have had a slow but fanservicey start, but by the end, LA thinks that Zetsoubou-hen trumped Mirai-hen if LA goes by what happens in near the finale of it fully showing the events that transpired the original and it's sequel games but where (true?) hope is in sight for Mirai-hen, Zetsubou-hen by it's title alone, you'll know it'll sink into despair as it being a prequel deemed it to happen. A prequel in ANY kind of media has it's huge problems, but LA is safe to say that Zetsubou-hen is quite safe from the deluge of problems prequels in the media have and it helps that Mirai-hen was a great companion piece anime to Zetsubou-hen to make it a unique prequel anime on it's own right and an even more complex set of animes together. Even if many things from Zetsubou-hen's timeline to the games are retconned and really for what LA \"researched\" (Only being Danganronpa 2 and Ultra Despair Girls through Youtube) for an \"anime only\" timeline following the prequel to really the launching pad for the entire franchise, LA was overall satisfied by it, retcon and plot holes and all, be it LA trying to find clues to Mirai-hen or wanting to find out how this really ALL started and that in itself was enough for LA to overlook it's flaws...but still realize it HAS these flaws.",

            "content": "This review is also based off the game Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair. (Possible very minor spoilers)\r\nThe story is about how the characters from the game Danganronpa 2 became Despairs. So the story is about what happened before Danganronpa 2 took place and how they came to be Despairs, which is obvious cause it's called the despair arc. Which I think they have did a good job of trying to accomplish this, but I have a few minor disappointments. Besides that the story is very interesting. But in my opinion it felt a bit rushed.\r\nThe art is good and is it very true to the series.But with a few disappoints such as, Gundham Tanaka and Hiyoko Saionji's hair is different. Besides those few minor details, they did a great job. Chiaki Nanami is THE Ultimate Waifu, enough with this \"Ultimate Gamer\". (she didn't deserve what happened to her in episode 10)\\n\\n\r\nI really like the opening for this animei and its pretty catchy in my opinion. I didn't hear much background music throughout the anime, so there's nothing really I can say there.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters personalities have stayed the same as in the game, so no disappointments there. They kept Peko and Fuyuhiko's relationship between them secretive as they did in the game. They did a lot of these things, such as, Hiyoko's loathful attitude towards Mikan. Akane and Nekomaru's rivalry between each other and Kazuichis one-sided love for Sonia, etc. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this series this season, definitely something worth checking out. I really recommend you watch a playthrough of the game or play it yourself before you watch this anime, it will make a little more sense if you do.",

            "content": "Man I love Danganronpa. Guys I am a BIIIIIIG Danganronpa fan ...I mean look at my name and picture.When I finished the First game I was shocked of how AWESOME that shit was.I thought there will be no way Danganrona 2 be better than the first....but i was wrong...........oh boy I was ......and thats when I have fell into ETERNAL ZETSUBOU!!!!!Ok I apologize for the long intro, what I am trying to say is that every entry in the series sets the bar so high for the next entry to overcome. When Danganronpa 3 was announced , I just couldn't wait to see it ...andi honestly I was anticipating the despair arc more than the future one and I gotta say...........I am quite dissapointed :(\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nDespair arc keeps the hyperbolic vibrant colors from the past entries and WOW it is GORGEOUS.....The abundance of cheerful colors in this anime really makes you feel the hope atmosphere,it is really beautiful.However the character drawings in some instance are really horrible compared to the game designs...I felt like the details for the characters were decreased and that honestly made it feel as if an amateur was drawing the character ...kind of reminds of higurashi. Overall the art is really beautiful...it takes the danganronpa aesthetics and applies them into a hope world where you can literally feel the solace in the scenes but I honestly preferred the future arc art which I would be reviewing later\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is actually shared between future and despair arc but each anime recycles certain past soundtracks that fits its themes. In this anime I am not gonna say I was wowed....I felt it was pretty lazy.The new tracks were honestly not as good as the ones before...But I am always a sucker for any of the past danganronpa soundtracks which i really loved hearing them again here.Last but not least....I loved the opening....DAMN I would they really made a nice choice with kami iro awasi, the song's has the feel of serenity and nostalgia,Definitely something that fits the anime perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10\\n\r\nok lets stop with the small things and get down to buisness. The thing about the 1st danganronpa adaption is that it fails to adapt the narrative style of the game. Danganronpa 1 and 2 were pretty slow but the narration was perfect...you really feel the moment of every scene but the anime adaption fail because of restricted number of episodes and as result it ended up being to fast and not as good as the game. Now they did the same risk here and I gotta say....HOLY SHIT...The narration style of this anime is GARBAGE!!!Like seriously you don`t feel as if the anime is telling a story, you feel like the anime is just a series of flashback and  and events that are transitioned sooooooooooo SHITly if such a word exist. Let's take a closer look. Honestly the first 2 episodes were PERFECT..Literally what I wanted from a prequel. It  starts of really upbeat and hopeful. You even get see how the new characters introduced in danganronpa 3 future had influence in the past events. Not to mention how you get say the times spent between Hinata and Nanami which was SOOOOOO SWEEEEET..But then everything gets broken....you see the anime goes at an EXTREMELY FAST PACE....I am not kidding, this is the worst story pacing i've ever seen in an anime. You have that episode that is entirely covering the twilight syndrome events..I honestly had goosebumps when I knew that it's finally gonna happen..but that episode had everything wrong with danganronpa 3 despair arc....It was so brief and summarized and there are certain things that I was longing to learn about from this episode wasn't there!!!!! It was awful. From this episode the anime starts to just link side stories and skim through events...and that's a big problem. Another example, there is this episode that is dedicated entirely to further build up few characters from the future arc. I do appreciate that  to some extent...but when you look at the bigger picture you will realize that it was awkwardly placed there...it is the most boring episode in the anime....and then a HUUUUUUUUUGE TIME SKIP!!!!!!!!!! The last thing that really disappointed me in this anime is the \"Master plan\" leading to the tragedy..I will not talk  in details here to avoid spoilers...But I really found it underwhelming, it wasn't as despairing as i thought it would be and...wait *SNIFF* *SNIFF*...what is this smell???.....OMG......it's PLOT HOLES????????Ok now there were some parts that were good in the story i wont lie...there were themes at least....but i still can't believe that spike chunsoft made a BROKEN and HALF-ASSED story....I am shocked seriously...Really wouldn't have lost any part of the experience had i just read the story through the wiki pages...it's the same thing....BLAND AS HELL\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\r\nOk i wouldn't say the characters are bad but it definitely was mediocre. First of all, The ENTIRE Danganronpa 2 cast were USELESS in this anime WITH few exceptions: Nanami and Hinata. I felt sometimes that those characters with the hollow figures were more interesting. I mean literally they have verrryyy little to do here...they just goof around the entire series. Although I mentioned exceptions but even those exceptions were not that good. At the beginning there were really nice relationship scenes between Nanami and Hinata, but The anime just decides to minimize it at the end in favor of including more SHIT. I even felt that Enoshima Junko was...well just Enoshima Junko..nothing new. There wasn't alot of moments were I really felt disturbed from her. Infact, she started to feel annoying. However What really saved this anime for me at least are the new characters ESPECIALLY Ryota Mitarai. I felt the anime build them up really . Actually you cant tell that there was more focus on them due to their screen time and they did a good job , but sacrificing some parts to improve others is not what a great anime does\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nThe only thing that pushed far to complete this arc is my danganronpa fetish. Honestly there are some parts that i really enjoyed from my heart but there are other parts that I forced myself to enjoy. Honestly, There are ALOOT of plot points in this anime that would've been more awesome given that would've been great had the the direction was better. I found myself thinking about the anime several times and realize...well actually that was pretty good but yeah it wasn't effective. usually Danganronpa is the type of story that will grip your heart untill the very end. but that's not the case here. The anime really failed to deliver some interesting plot points in an interesting way \\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nOk maybe it's not that bad as I have made it sound..there were some redeeming qualities..add that to your despair addiction and you will find yourself enjoying this anime at few parts. But let's be honest here...Kodaka can make PERFECT GAMES!!!but anime...there are  restriction when it comes to anime and one of them is time...We all know that danganronpa is a story that likes to take its time building a great story..but in anime this is hard. IN my personal opinion with this type of quality it would've been acceptable if despair arc was just a 2 hour movie without adding alot of shit...that way future arc would've been given more episodes and time to build itself.Future arc is WAAAY better than despair arc but it still have some issues...I will make a conclusion on the entire Danganronpa 3 series when the hope arc comes out.In the end, Dangonronpa 3 is a fair anime with a broken story elements and missed opportunities that had some enjoyment in it",

            "content": "Starting my first review, I want to make some things clear. First of all, this isn't a good anime. It's not even decent, despite my score. Danganronpa 3 is just bad. If you didn't play the game, you probably won't understand anything. And if you did play it, you will probably end up disappointed, just like me. Secondly, it's this type of anime that is just poorly arranged. It has plot holes and doesn't offer anything that haven't been in this universe before. Also there will be spoilers from the rest of the series. Okay, let's start the proper review. \r\nDanganronpa 3 was supposed tobe supplement for both Danganronpa 1 and 2. Yet it failed miserably. Well, maybe not exactly, since you do get the reasons why some characters went bad, and you do get to see Twilight Syndrome Murder Case, student council massacre and the rise of Izuru Kamukura. But it's neither well-written nor interesting. Everyone expected that anime adaptation of Twilight Syndrome Murder Case will be something with a huge impact on the characters, something tragic, something that could lead to despair. In the anime this major problem was solved in one episode, which presents almost nothing that we wouldn't know from game. It also doesn't seem like anyone remembered it for more than two weeks. \\n\\n\r\nSo how about main plot? Do we get to see an interesting manipulation that leads class 77 to despair side? Yes, we do get to see what leaded to despair. And it's probably the biggest flaw in this anime. It's just so disappointing and became objects of many memes. Seriously, I'd never thought that main flaw in Danganropa would be plot. But how about other things? Maybe we get something interesting like interactions between DR1 characters and DR2 characters? Or maybe DR/Zero characters appear? Maybe even a Hope Peak's Elementary? No, no, no, don't count on it. The whole DR/Zero is completely ignor- oh no, I forgot that they've shown two characters for like 5 seconds and that's it. Only the first two episodes were about characters, and they were honestly the best ones. \\n\\n\r\nClass 77, despite being main characters, is mostly absent, aside for fan favourites like Komaeda or Chiaki, but I didn't care about them. Why would I? Chiaki became perfect waifu that only plays games and is good-looking. And obviously every character likes her. Nagito on the other hand, while being an overally interesting character, has \"power of luck\" and talks about hope non-stop. He didn't change at all. Sometimes Mikan or Ultimate Impostor appear, but only UI gets development. Mikan only serves a cheap fanservice purpose here, which made me hate her even more. In the second half there also appears Junko Enoshima and her sister Mukuro Ikusaba, the 16th student, lying somewhere hidden in the school, the one that's called the ultimate despair. It's nice to see our main antagonist back, but instead of making her intelligent and ruthless manipulant, like she was in the game, she became an unoriginal and boring Joker-like villian. She just lost her charm.\\n\r\nThe rest of the \"main characters\" almost don't appear in show, which is another reason why I don't like this anime. Why not include more of Ibuki, another fan favourite? Why not explain Hiyoko's or Mikan's background? Why does Mahiru act like a completely different person? Seriously, it's just wasted potential. So what about new characters? In Zetsubou-hen most important new characters are Chisa Yukizome - teacher in Hope Peak - Juzo Sakakura (former ultimate boxer) and Ryouta Mitarai, another ultimate student. The first one is a typical, energetic teacher that could appear in any other anime. Frankly, I didn't quite care about her. I won't write anything about Juzo, because he's probably the best character in this anime and his story is alright. The last one, Mitarai is a whinny, weak person, whose biggest passion is anime. He's also one of the reason why the plot is so bad. There are also a few others like Munakata, but I'll write about him in my Mirai-hen review. I appreciate the fact that they tried to create new characters, but I still prefer the old cast. \\n\\n\r\nI really don't care about graphic, but for me it's decent. There are some flaws in animation but I didn't notice them while watching or I just simply ignored them. The music is really nice to listen to. There are some familiar tracks that every fan will recognize. Opening is also really pleasant to the ear. As for ending - sung by Megumi Ogata - it's not bad, but it's not my favourite either. Like every adaptation should, this one does include the original VAs. They are as good as always, despite being on screen for a short time. \\n\\n\r\nSo did I enjoyed this? While it was airing, yes. But only because of threads on 4chan or other websites and that I hoped it will have something that I mentioned earlier. Well, maybe hype ruined it, but I don't think so. It was supposed to be about class 77, relationship between them, their backstory and how they ended up as the bad guys. They tried, but failed. And now, after the year has passed, I can say that I didn't enjoyed it.",

            "content": "I N T R O D U C T I O N\r\nI've been a fan of the Danganronpa game series since 2012. In 2013, Danganronpa: The Animation came out, and honestly, it was crap. The animation and art was pitiful, the characters were barely grazed and hardly as deep as the corresponding game had it, and it was just rushed. But that's the thing with animating an entire game in 13 episodes-- it's not possible to fit every scenario, so the anime had to condense it for only the main plot points to appear.\r\nNow, why do I mention the first animation when I should betalking about the 3rd Despair Arc? You need to be aware of my disappointment for that, so that you can understand I was overall impressed with the effort put into Danganronpa 3, both sides. The Despair Arc cannot be seen without knowing the plots of the 1st and 2nd Danganronpa games, so unless you've seen it, you'll likely be thoroughly confused. But anyways, Despair Arc explains the events before the 1st game, which had me interested to see. It's like more puzzle pieces were given to the viewer, to try to fathom all of this \"hope\" and \"despair\" madness. I wasn't very disappointed with what I got, thankfully enough.\\n\\n\r\nS H O R T C O M I N G S\\n\r\nI was introduced with the students of SD2 (Super Danganronpa 2) and some characters from the Future Arc, such as the homeroom teacher, Yukizome Chisa, the leader of the later Future Foundation, Munakata Kyosuke, etc. Getting to see them animated, along with new characters that I welcomed fairly enough, was exciting. However, I only get glimpses of their personalities, it seems? My personal expectations in an anime this short isn't very high on character, but again, I felt like I got only a taste of what the students were truly like (I won't spoil anything from SD2). I honestly wish I'd gotten more. \\n\\n\r\nFor the first two episodes, you feel like you're watching a slice-of-life, ridiculous comedy with friendships and rainbows and idealistic school life (also with that one perverted cook and that fanservice of pantsus). Then, well I love this, but it all just goes downhill and you know it. However, it felt like the beginning could've been more blended to the more despairing episodes that come after. It felt a bit more sudden than what it could've. It's somewhat predictable too as a whole, but I've already known the aftermath of these events, so I suppose it can't really be helped.\\n\\n\r\nThis kind of goes back to the characters, and maybe I'm not so forgiving for unrealistic scenarios, but these characters don't make sense. When you see someone you care about get killed, you won't follow the killer and do what she wishes, right? You'd either plot revenge or try to move on, almost ignoring what had happened. Or something else. Just not follow the one who murdered someone you care about. Also, some of these character's motives, their passion, are somewhat strange. One character is so passionate about making an anime to the point of sleepless nights, skipping school entirely, and acting like a high-strung, insane, desperate person. It seems like none of these characters are normal, which is kind of the thing Danganronpa has, but IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR A SANE PERSON? And no, I don't want just the principal, that old man, and that drunk guy! And Junko, control yourself! (I was joking, don't stone me)\\n\\n\r\nWhen I watched this, I was starting to expect two things: more explanation for Enoshima Junko's motives, and more story to Kamukura Izuru. I honestly didn't get much from either, at least, things I didn't already know. Kamukura was okay, but Junko felt so stupid to me. Like, is she just evil because she's just evil? She looks like a fool, honestly. I liked her in the 1st and 2nd games because she wasn't that big of a character, sort of, but now that she's a more appearing character, with her actions open like a book, it feels like she just does ridiculous things just because. And it feels stupid! No backstory, just because. And she has everything her way. \\n\\n\r\nBut then again, WWII happened, and this might be somewhat the same deal.\\n\\n\r\nP R O S\\n\r\nI could go on for a while regarding the good points. Again, seeing SD2's characters animated was real fun to watch. I was especially curious about Komaeda Nagito, Hajime Hinata and Nanami Chiaki. And, in case you haven't noticed, I watched this first before Future Arc, and finished it first too.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I got from this was pleasantly some Ikusaba Mukuro, which for some reason I didn't expect that much of. Even though her character was somewhat dissed off, I got to see her devotion to her sister and sides of her I otherwise wouldn't have seen. I also found more importance in Chiaki. Not that she wasn't important to the second game, but I always thought she was a little strange and off. Seeing her hope throughout this anime, in the midst of despair, was impressive. I also enjoyed most of the characters, as they kept this anime light, mostly.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the little tidbits, I think I see most of the characters in Despair Arc in Future Arc. Since they aired around the same time, I could switch back and forth if I wanted, and I found that doing so will explain things in the Future Arc. It'll explain some bad and good relationships between characters there. I also appreciated the cameos of the characters in Danganronpa 1.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the art, along with the music. I was majorly impressed. The animation was well done, and the art was consistent, and effort is shown in that department. It seemed like the games' tone was split in half, creating the tones of the Despair and Future arcs. The signature pink blood remained, but the colors were much brighter and lighter. As the story progressed, the colors did change, and oh my gosh the opening changes as you watch, I loved that. It just got darker and darker, and I was warned in the beginning that the story will end in despair, but still-- it's so enticing! And hearing Komaeda's VA sing the ED was heavenly.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I didn't really like the OP and ED, and that was because it didn't feel Danganronpa-like. It didn't have that jazz-pop feel that I adored. But it started to grow on me, and it made me realize that the despairing events occur midway of this anime, so it was appropriate. Midway, the soundtrack does switch a bit more to the familiar tunes you often get with Monokuma, so I'm satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nC L O S U R E\\n\r\nThis is probably the longest review I've written, but I literally just finished this anime and it's Saturday. I've yet to finish the Future Arc, and I know I probably spoiled some things without realizing it, but it's nothing explicit and in fact, you should expect the above things already? It's Danganronpa, wake up.\\n\\n\r\nI think this animation was amazingly done, compared to the first season. This isn't based off of any game, just shows events outside of the games. I'm glad the creators made that choice, though, as these events aren't exactly game-material and more for something like this. As I learn more and more about Danganronpa's story like how Once Upon A Time shows it (present to past, to present, to past), it's like more puzzle pieces are coming and eventually, will show a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nI can't wait for that day, when I know all of it. Hope will triumph over despair, you guys. ;)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 38/50 ~ 76% ~ 8/10",

            "content": "I'm using my small introduction for reviewing both this and Future so you may see this twice.\r\nI used to be a big Danganronpa fan. I got the VITA for the sole purpose of playing the games, when SDR2 was only getting translated by some random people on the internet and the first game had just gotten localized. I've spent a lot of my time on Danganronpa, analyzing it, doing fanarts, discussing theories with other people, reading the fan-translated novels, playing Ultra Despair Girls, and although it had some flaws, I really the Danganronpa series overall.\r\nBut when I knew that they announced an anime, I justhad this bad feeling. Danganronpa: The Animation wasn't really good, as the quantity of episodes was just not enough for the hole plot and it tried to fit like 20+ hours of gameplay in 13 episodes of approximately 25 minutes. 20+ of gameplay, details, plot, characters, into less than 6 hours approximately of an animation. And obviously, the adaptation wasn't really the best. But I thought, \"Hey, they won't make the same mistake twice. Besides, two arcs? That's a total of 24 episodes, so maybe it will be different!\"\\n\\n\r\nOh, how wrong I was.\\n\\n\r\nBoth despair and future side just tried to throw in a bowl and mix a lot of characters, random plot ideas, deaths with no meaning, and terrible death flags that screamed \"hey lol i'm gonna die now\". One of the major things about Danganronpa that I liked was how ridiculous, yet interesting the plot twists were. Even if you expected some of them, it was interesting to see how the dots connected, the contradictions, the solutions, and the characters going through that trip to the truth. And sometimes the twist would make you go \"holy shit\", because you didn't really get to see them coming.\\n\\n\r\nDanganronpa 3 didn't include any of those. Instead, the supposedly \"plot twists\" were so predictable, they basically screamed to your face \"enjoy this characters because we are going to kill it\". All the raising of death flags was painful to see, it felt like watching a Blue's Clues episode of how obvious everything was. A lot of cheap and mediocre tactics to get the ratings up, including unnecessary weird fanservice (although I kind of can let that pass because almost all animes do that), fake deaths of loved characters to keep the \"cliffhanger up\", and most of the \"cliffhangers\" were basically thrown out to hell next episodes as they killed the hype.\\n\\n\r\nSupposedly, Despair side was about the class of SDR2 (which I'm not getting into as it may spoil, but if you plan on watching it, at least watch a playthrough of the game if you want to understand). It started fine, as most of the watchers are at familiar with the cast, with the typical cliche unnecessary fanservice, including a small ecchi scene, but not that terrible to throw it all to hell. But around the fourth episode, they started skipping stuff. Important stuff. Weird, unclear time skips that just didn't make a lot of sense. At first, I personally believed it was just for the sake of time, as they had other characters from the class to dig in. But I was wrong. Instead, the time was mostly spent on other characters that I won't give names, because again, it would spoil a little bit.There was almost no development on the SDR2 class, and they were mostly joke characters filling the background for some minutes.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of stuff contradicted the canon, the novels were not considered, Nanami Chiaki went basically to a whiny Mary Sue depending on Hinata Hajime despite knowing him little, looking like on of those over exaggerated cliche shoujo protagonists. Komaeda Nagito was only a \"hope boner\" instead of an interesting character with different views that were interesting to analyze. And others character didn't get the stage for more than 5 minutes. Knowing the characters from SDR2 was totally pointless, as they were made into cliche, badly \"developed\" characters, if you can call that \"development.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime just killed the essence of Danganronpa itself. No surprises, no cliffhangers, no plot twists, no character development. Just a terrible ripoff of Dora the Explorer with murder and some crappy hope vs despair plot.\\n",

            "content": "(I try to keep my reviews short and sweet and straight to the point without giving away spoilers with that said lets get this show on the road)\r\nStory- The purpose of this anime was to explain how despair spread throughout the first Danganronpa. However, I was completely let down with the story line. I felt that the story was completely rushed. Also that certain aspects of the plot jut didn't make sense. For example most of the characters are in high school and all of these \"awful & tragic\" things were happening. I started to think were are these kids parent or guardian. (Even thoughanime is not restricted, if an anime decides to use a certain genre in the story there are certain aspect and expectations that are group with that).\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound-  The art was modern, however at some points video game visuals appeared. Sound was also good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Their was a character for ever type of personality. I liked how some of the characters were relatable. Their personalities really compliments each other. However no one character stood put from the pack and made a personal impression on me. Nonetheless, they all have a role to play. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I didn't enjoy this anime because I felt that it was so bland and didn't make sense. I found myself watching it not because I wanted too but because I had nothing else to do. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- I only watched this anime due to the fact that I have seen the first Danganronpa. I essentially just wanted clarification on certain aspects of that anime. Even though this anime did give an explanation, I felt that they just pulled it out of thin air. Complete let down.\\n\\n",

            "content": "With me being such a big fan of the games and the first game anime adaption being fairly lackluster my expectations for the future and despair arc were quite mixed (although that didn't stop me from being super hyped), but now that shows over I think my hype was rightfully placed. Also quick disclaimer, you should have absolutely played the first two games before watching these.\r\nIn the despair arc the anime follows the characters of the 2nd game taking place when they first join Hope's Peak Academy before the events of either game. The show starts off fairly slow and laid back but don't befooled because the show only gets darker and darker as it progresses, you may think you've hit the peak of despair in one episode then BAM the despair hits even harder later on until we eventually hit \"The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History\".\\n\\n\r\nComing into this season I was really wondering how well they would portray the characters because I absolutely loved the cast from the 2nd game and let me say they did a spot on job capturing the unique quirkiness of all of them, right down to Mikans incredible clumsiness, Akanes never ending hunger, Hiyokos total bitchiness towards Mikan, TeruTerus pervertedness and etc. The show also does a great job throwing in nice little tidbits of information/back story at you through out, stuff like Hiyokos random growth spurt, where the Ultimate Imposter comes from and the relationship between Junko & Mukuro. Overall they do a great job with the characters and the character development, they are absolutely the shining point of this show.\\n\\n\r\nNow like I said the show starts off slow but very quickly changes into a never ending ride on the despair train with no brakes. But with that being said it never stops being entertaining to watch, whether it was watching the shenanigans of the 2nd games cast, the interactions between Junko and basically everyone else whether she be in a playful mode with her sister Mukuro or being in total despair mode and ruining the lives of everyone else. Now I will say there was one point in the show that was so dark it actually left me feeling pretty upset, since most of you should have played the 2nd game before watching this you should have known that a certain event will take place and let me just say this, prepare yourselves because I certainly was not but I do give the show props because they must be doing something right if they can make me feel this deeply about it.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end the show does a good job rapping this prequel story up and sets things up nicely to roll into the 1st games plot. Now while it did end things off nicely, that's not quite it for the story, for those who've been paying attention to the news you should already know but a new \"Hope\" arc has been announced and is said to be the end all of the story. Now that I am done with this I am definitely pretty hyped for the end of the story, although perhaps a little sad too having this big story come to an end that had me so captivated through out but all in all I do have high 'hope' for a great ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed the show, my fairly high expectations coming into this season were not let down. I guess I should also take quick note that the art is nothing special but certainly nothing bad and the music is great (aslong as you liked the soundtrack to the 2nd game that is). To anyone who enjoys the games even a little I highly recommend you watch this anime!",

            "content": "This anime should NOT be watched before playing DR1 and DR2.\r\nThis anime SHOULD be watched alongside Mirai-hen one episode at a time.\r\nDR3 appeals to quite a niche audience and they'll watch it regardless of how good it is. I know I did. Let's face it, as an anime, Zetsubou-hen is pretty mediocre and decent at best, but the story it set out to tell is still as interesting as a Danganronpa story should be. Unfortunately though, I have to review this as an anime.\r\nZetsubou-hen is equipped with fully realized characters and a good outline of a story, but its execution is...pretty poor. A lot ofit is just exposition with meager attempts to convey emotion via mundane dialogues, lacking in any sense of stakes or scale and full of cliches. The characters are treated as plot device and less as actual human beings, those of class 77 especially. The anime spends most of its time holding our hands through every bit of detail in the story, expecting us to not be able to pick them up ourselves. Frankly, I had this issue with the games as well, but it wasn't nearly as apparent then.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime appears to be a show of a turn-of-events and just that; history. Scenes are drawn out past their relevance and feel pointless where they could've been used to build characters past what we already know about them. The story rises with mostly slow pacing to a dissatisfying payoff, and most of the enjoyment was makeshift inside my head by analyzing the story and characters way past what the anime could've possibly intended.\\n\\n\r\nExpect cheap animations, sub-par screenplay, nice but underused characters, and some classic DR fanservice. If you're not into DR, why bother. If you've played or read DR material before, treat this as a 12-episode cutscene instead. It'll give you some closure to questions and loose ends you probably have, but that's the only incentive I can think of.\\n\\n\r\nLoved the opening song though. Also <3 Junko xoxo",

Asahina, Naegi, had a past, they were in Danganronpa 1, (It was the best) and this one was.. very hard to feel for the characters, Kirigiri's death had me emotional (sorry if it was a spoi- wait, if you haven't watched chapter one then shoo.

But shit I am disappointed in this chapter, I wanted main characters, :( Everytime I want a ship going these amazing people sit there like \"Dhuuur letz kill dem guyz mk?\" Not well done on their side. :/",

            "content": "This is a review simply for the Despair arc. I have not finished watching the Future arc yet, but really needed to share my thoughts on this absolutely tragic disaster of an anime.\r\nBefore I start the review, I'll say I've played Danganronpa 1+2. I liked the first game for what it was, but I did not like the second game very much, honestly, because I found the ending rather stupid. I've also seen the Danganronpa anime, which I thought was an utterly average adaptation of the first game.\r\nThis is not going to be like my other reviews, in which I talk about things I likedand disliked, because I cannot reasonably do that with this anime. There were so many instances of this anime being absolutely unjustifiably ridiculous that I'm going to talk about the entire story and point out when something I dislike happens. Which will be a lot.\\n\\n\r\n~*~*~*With that being said, spoilers start here and continue throughout~*~*~*\\n\\n\r\nThis anime arc functioned as a prequel to Danganronpa 2, explaining how the ultimate despairs came to be. It started out with a bunch of fluff to get to know the characters, a lot of which I found cringeworthy at best and difficult to watch at worst. Teruteru and Kazuichi are two characters I could not stand in the game as they were creepy and stalkerish, and this anime only exemplifies that. Regardless, this only lasted a short amount of time and it commenced with the story after a couple of episodes setting the scene.\\n\r\nSo it starts with their class of 15 students, and Hajime is in the reserve course, paying high fees to attend the world class Hope's Peak Academy. To begin with, the anime focuses a lot on Chiaki, who to begin with is very shy and somewhat aloof, until their teacher, Chisa, tells Chiaki that it's more fun to play with friends. This is how she befriends Hajime.\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Hajime, despite his friendship with Chiaki, decides he's not happy with the fact that he lacks talent like the Super High School Levels in the main course, and volunteers himself to secret Project Kamakura - a biomedical project to create a superhuman with all talents - the Ultimate Hope, who would be named after Kamakura Izuru, the founder of Hope's Peak, and could potentially save the school from all the terrible things that had been happening (THAT COULDN'T POSSIBLY GO WRONG). Terrible things, such as TWO STUDENTS BEING MURDERED, which whilst was talked about in Danganronpa 2, the game, I expected more of an explanation of in the anime. Needless to say, I didn't get said explanation.\\n\r\nIn the meantime, Komaeda Nagito gets himself suspended, as well as 3 other students expelled, which other than to set a scene for the conflict in Future arc, seemed pretty irrelevant to the story, and honestly felt like an after-thought.\\n\r\nIt was at this point where I felt the story just got really silly and I just couldn't take it seriously anymore. I kind of lost all hope (no pun intended) in this anime being any good whatsoever.\\n\r\nThe first year at Hope's Peak was over, and a new group of students had entered the school - the cast of Danganronpa 1 - including Despair Sisters. Almost immediately upon being introduced, Enoshima Junko is painted as truly, irrationally evil, and her sister just kind of watches in awe. It's very clear Makuro is a masochist, but I find the dynamic of these two honestly uncomfortable, especially given that in DR1 she was willing to be sassy and fight back with Monokuma, who she very clearly would've known was Junko. One could argue she was perfectly okay with being killed by her sister and agreed to it, but Junko said at the end of that game that it was a spur of the moment decision and she only decided to kill Makuro as she was getting in her way. Maybe it's a minor thing to be so nitpicky about, but her characterisation seemed way off.\\n\r\nJunko goes to meet with Izuru, who despite the inhumane experimentation Hajime was put through to create Izuru, was in a room by himself under no monitoring or supervision. Makes sense, right? Junko speaks to him, tries to convince him that hope is boring and despair is exciting, so he should switch to the dark side, obviously wanting to use him, as someone with as much talent as Izuru could be absolutely devastating and wreak all kinds of despair on mankind.\\n\r\nIzuru decides to meet with her, and they lock the 13 student council members (don't ask how they all agreed to meet up in that room with Enoshima, because that's never explained) and Junko & Makuro basically say \"Kill each other or we'll reveal all of your darkest secrets and everything you don't want anyone to know\". No clue how she set this up, how no one in the school noticed, and why they decided to listen to her when if they just stayed put, everyone could've been saved by teachers and Junko would've been caught, meaning the tragedy never even had to happen, but we'll roll with it for now.\\n\r\nJunko somehow just happens to run into Mitarai, the Super High School Level Animator, who for the record, had not been attending Hope's Peak, with the Imposter taking his place instead. The one time he does leave the house, he bumps into Junko, who asks him who he is, and she insults anime. So Mitarai goes \"WELL I'LL SHOW YOU, MY ANIME IS GREAT\" to literally a stranger who he's never spoken to in his life. He takes this girl he's known for 5 minutes back to HIS HOUSE and lets her watch this anime he's been making, meant to make the world a better place. His style of animation changes people's brain signals to make watchers feel any way the animator wants them to. Of course, this leads Junko to threatening him into making an anime she wants, that will invoke despair onto those who watch it. When I say anime, it's an edited video of the classroom killing between the student council members.\\n\r\nJunko takes Mitarai to her lair underneath the school, which again, for some reason exists and no one in the school knows about. How it was built? When? God knows. I don't think they thought that far ahead.\\n\r\nMikan is the first subject of the despair inducing video, and it works on her. How Mikan got wrapped up into this is something I didn't bother to explain before and certainly won't now. Anyway, Nagito, Chiaki and their teacher Chisa go to find her, and discover Junko's lair. Nagito gets shot and lives (because Nagito), and Chisa tells Chiaki to run away with Nagito and go back to their classmates.\\n\r\nChisa begins to interrogate Junko about what's going on, who shows her she has the power to brainwash people, and proceeds to a very unnecessarily uncomfortable scene of a student trying to saw off his own head with a hacksaw.\\n\r\nShe proceeds to brainwash Chisa using the video, with another uncomfortable awkward scene, where despite the fact that she's clearly being tortured and you can hear her screams, the anime thinks it's somehow appropriate timing to show close up shots of her breasts and legs. This is a huge complaint I had about Danganronpa 2, as well. Inappropriately timed jokes and fanservice. But this scene really took the cake....\\n\r\nChisa's class decide it's a good idea to go back to the lair to save their teacher. Chiaki gets separated from the bunch and meets with Chisa who she assumes is trying to help her. In actual fact, Chisa leads her to her execution, which is used to invoke despair into the minds of Chisa's class, making them all Ultimate Despairs.\\n\r\nJunko went on to brainwash all the reserve students into suicide too.\\n\r\nMeanwhile, Izuru stuck around Junko, watching, sometimes commenting, but not really doing anything, which made it really hard for me to think of him as a bad guy or as if any of this was his fault at all.\\n\r\nThose who Junko didn't brainwash, she manipulated into not speaking up, which is frankly stupid. How much power do they really think a high school girl and her masochist sister have? Not just that, but she WAS suspected, and in spite of that, they still went along with locking her in Hope's Peak, setting the scene for Danganronpa 1. I personally don't understand why, if they had the slightest bit of suspicion that Junko could've caused the Tragedy, they would lock her in the school.\\n\r\nLast of all, I'd like to add that all of this \"reserve student\" talk retcons the beginning of the first game. The whole idea was that it was purely by luck that Makoto got into Hope's Peak despite his lack of talent, when you could all along. It was very thoroughly stated in the first game that only talented individuals got into Hope's Peak. They kept insisting Makoto's talent is luck, completely retconning why his talent was luck in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, this anime is an absolute disaster because it retcons bits of canon, has absolutely illogical plot points (Junko's lair underneath the school? Basically anything Junko does?) and overall is a very lazy way to explain why Danganronpa 2 ended the way it did. \"They were all brainwashed by anime\" is honestly one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has cemented to me that Junko is somehow a Mary-Sue VILLAIN. She's perfect in every conceivable way and manages to make things happen which frankly she shouldn't have the power to, and it's utterly mind-boggling to me.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch an anime where the world goes into dystopia because of an actual reasonable threat to mankind, either watch Death Note or Devilman Crybaby. A haughty high school girl making anime does not justify the world's downfall to despair, frankly.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, it still hasn't beat Citrus as the worst anime I've ever seen.",

            "content": "The prequel has ended, and as the the anime franchise ends, it was a bit of a disappointment when, this anime ends with some plot hole at it's Kibou-hen arc.\r\nSo, let's get down to my review business of this prequel:\r\nStorywise, I give it a 7 over 10, though this prequel did performed as what the synopsis said it was, thought there were still some plot holes in this prequel, like how can such video created by Mitarai cause some Hysteria among the students of the reserve course, and how was Junko able to know who to go for her master plan. Also, scene like howPeko killed Sato wasn't added that would have give some spice to this anime's story line. Let's not forget as to how exaggerated the character's were, like why would a school like Hope Peak dabble in human experiments like cearting someone like Izuru Kamukura, when it would be better off if they make a super computer that is an advance form of AI.\\n\\n\r\nArt, If I were to choose who's the coolest among the characters in terms of illustration , I'd say, Junko would be one of them, followed by Chisa, MUnakata, Hajime and Sonia, the rest were just too plain or too dorky like \\n\r\nSouda,Gundam, Ibuki, Seiko, Andou, Peko, Yuuto, Hanamaru, Izayoi and Mikan  who were the dorksters. Others like Nidai and Owari were a league of their own which was just too rugged, btw the only fanservice one would see is Owari at the anime's opening. The rest were just too plain and having said that this category is a 7 over 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound, ok, some of the character's here weren't suppose to sound like adults, like Gundam, Owari, Sonia and Seiko, they all sounded very much like grown ups, but I still like some of the seiyuus who did their voices, some of the character's sounded too girlish, like with Mikan,Hanamaru, Andou and Miharu. of course there are thsoe who sounded just right given the character's characteristics, like Nidai, Chisa, Sato and\\n\r\nIbuki. Though, generally speaking the seiyuus who did the character's voice were ok, I'm still gonna go for a 7 over 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, I were a Mensa member( organization of people with high IQ), I would be giving this anime/manga/game original creator, Kodaka, Kazutaka a piece of my mind, let's face it the characters were very much overly done that the concept of them being this Super High School Level thing\\n\r\nkinda makes them more of an oxymoron, I mean how can such talented people be given the superlative of either Super level or Ultimate, also since when does being a House keeper have such title, when the character's occupation itself was more of a vocation than a skill or a talent, in fact such superlatives contradicts the character's themselves, let's go over them:\\n\\n\r\nJunko Enoshima the Super High School Level Fashion Diva, Super High School Level Despair / Super High School Level Analyst and her lackey Mukuro Ikusaba a so called Super High School Level Soldier. one is nothing more than a megalomaniac psychopath,  her character is one big plot-hole, since we never got to know as to why she became like that, while the other is more of a henchman than a soldier, I meant she only has a knife , but no guns,we also never get to know her past, since in the first Danganronpa, she was killed off instantly.....( I don't know if she has any background info about her from the manga).\\n\\n\r\nNagito \"The Servant\" Komaeda, the  Super High School-Level Luck, Really, luck is a talent? Man, his character was just sooo lame, should he even be in this thing? gosh, if he's that lucky maybe they should have made him as this Super Level Gambler, wtf was the original creator thinking?\\n\\n\r\nHajime Hinata the reserve course student,a.k.a Izuru Kamukura, tsk, tsk, tsk, he should be this super level envious guy, since he just entered into something that he already has, being the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nChiaki Nanami the Super High-school Level Gamer, the 1st of 77th class to die. Yuuto Kamishiro the Super High School Level Secret Agent a fat guy who for a while pretended to be Mitarai.  Ibuki Mioda a Super High-school Level Light Music Club a girl masochistic tendency after becoming one of the remnants of despair. Sonia Nevermind the Super High-school Level Princess, ok so where is her title , bodyguards and crown? some princess she was, she hardly does anything, super level primadona is what she should be.\\n\r\n HA! Should all be classified as super level lazy bones or loiterers, since what they do was very much what a lazy bone would do, waste their time for nothing.\\n\\n\r\nRyouta Mitarai, the Ultimate Animator, the chicken shit who created the despair video for Junko and Mikan Tsumiki, the weak link and a so called Super High-school Level Nurse, should both be classified as super level pussies, cu'z their both pussies, except one is a smart pussy, and the other is a stupid pussy.\\n\\n\r\nKazuichi Souda the  Super High-school Level Mechanic, Gundam \"Forbidden One\" Tanaka a so called  Super High-school Level Animal Breeder with an  eccentric and rather dark personality and Teruteru Hanamura the fat guy, with a masochistic tendency,. who happens to be this Super High-school Level Cook\\n\r\n should all be classified as the ultimate oddball trio, who probably should all see  a shrink.\\n\\n\r\nNekomaru \"Mechamaru\" Nidai the Super High-school Level Coach and big eater ,  Akane Owari a Super High-school Level Gymnast and Nidai's sparring partner also big eater, should be in a relationship and have the title the super level fighting duo, in fact they should be duking out with Peko and Makuro, too bad, creator, Kodaka, Kazutaka did thought of it.\\n\\n\r\nHiyoko Saionji the Super High-school Level Classical Dancer, how the fuck did she grew up fast after 6 months?  Mahiru Koizumi the Super High-school Level Photographer, both should be called the ultimate wall flowers, since they're just for display without any function at all.\\n\\n\r\nLet's not forget the Ultimate kick-out trio:\\n\\n\r\nRuruka Andou the Ultimate Confectioner who got got kicked out of Hope peak, along with Seiko Kimura the Ultimate Pharmacist and Sounosuke Izayoi the Ultimate Blacksmith, who is also Andou's man bitch. Whose skills and talents should not be in a high school but in college, spoiler, since they got kick out before Junko's Despair scheme , they never become part of the Remnants of Despair , never the less in Mirai-hen they're no different at all from the Remnants of Despair. But I kinda like them, since in the end they turn against each other, but it's a pity that Sieko live as a sucker and she died as a sucker, all because she can't say no to Andou, so she should have the title as the super level high school sucker, as for Andou, she should also have the title ultimate manipulator since in the most part all she does is manipulate everyone most specially Seiko and her man bitch Izayoi. Izayoi n the other hand should be this ultimate sacrificial lamb, since he's just too stupid to let himself be manipulated by Andou. \\n\\n\r\nPeko Pekoyama the Super High-school Level Swords-woman, Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu's bodyguard/ hit-woman and Fuyuhiko Kuzuryuu the Super High-school Level Gangster, both belong to the category of super level crminals in prison, since that's where the two should belong and not in Hope Peak Academy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly: \\n\\n\r\nChisa Yukizome the teacher of 77th class of Hope Peak Academy and the Ultimate Housekeeper, HOUSEKEEPER?! is someone who can be classified as the Ultimate WTF. Her role as a plain teacher would have been enough, but giving her such superlatives is crazy.\\n\\n\r\nKyousuke Munakata the vice-leader of Future Foundation and the head of the 2nd Division, who once held the title of  Ultimate Student Council President when he was a student at Hope Peak, was pretty much a well suited antihero and so as his gay admirer, Juuzou Sakakura the Ultimate Boxer,  leader of the 6th Division and in control of the Special Crime Investigation Unit. In this prequel I kinda hate that they failed to anticipate such mayhem that has ravage the school and the world, where one would have wish that they should have deal with Junko in the first palce if it weren't for Juuzo's chicken shit secret that Junko has over him.\\n\\n\r\nSo, for this category I give it a 3 over 10, since in this prequel nobody is the protagonist, every character here are an antagonist , and such oxymoronic concept of them is something I really hate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, I give it an 8 over 10, despite of the character's oxymoronic concept , this is one episode that one would enjoy from the start to the end, also the them about despair vs hope would really get to you, But.............\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it may have an pen ending given that this is a prequel, but , not getting Junko in the first place by Juuzo, is a disappointment, so this prequel is good  but not that good, so it's a 7 over 10. then again the Kibou-hen makes up for this prequel's short coming, but that's another review.\\n\\n\r\nFU,FU,FU,FUUU!!!!! \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I was jumping for joy upon the reveal of Danganronpa 3. I had fallen deeply in love with the murder mystery novel series. Then when Despair Arc was revealed I was even more ecstatic since Danganronpa 2 was my favorite. So watching this series completely and utterly broke my heart. It'd be one thing if it was a pointless and mediocre addition to the franchise but this anime actually brings down the quality of other entries into this series. I plan to review the other two \"Arcs\" of this anime as well but I'm gonna start with my most hated one. Also if you haven'tplayed the games of Danganronpa I would recommend turning back since I'm operating under the assumption that you've played them. So with that said time to start\\n\r\nStory 1/10\\n\r\nThe story of Danganronpa 3 Despair Arc is of the 77th class falling into despair. At least that's what it says on the tin. While that is detailed in a way that... I'll get to later, the story is focused more on the tragedy in general. Although the start to that doesn't begin until halfway in. The first half is focused more on plot points that go nowhere, big moments from the games that are forgotten and one of the stupidest possible reasons for Hinata taking the Kamukura project. I won't spoil it but... It's bad. But ok that's only the first half so how's the second half? Worse. The more the story goes, the more huge holes are formed and very few are addressed, in ways that feel half-hearted. Not to mention there is one plot point in particular which is probably one of the most enraging. I won't get into it now, because it contains spoilers for the anime, and it's a long rant but I've decided to give it a whole paragraph to itself later on, so look forward to that.\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10\\n\r\nOf the characters shown in Danganronpa 3 the strongest performance comes from previously unestablished characters. For the most part they are  likeable and fun, my favorites being the ultimate mom friend Chisa, the sweet cinnamon roll Seiko, the suave Kizakura and Juzo Sakakura a canonically LGBT character. Good on you guys. But the returning characters... Well, let's just say I have THOUGHTS on them. First of all let's start with the DR2 characters this was advertised as being the story of. They are made into side characters at best and plot devices at worst, and their interesting personalities and backstories were stripped away and instead their characters all consist of a single personality trait. But none have it as bad as Chiaki Nanami. Chiaki for poorly explained reasons that serve to take a massive dump on Chihiro and negate a lot of her own development is a human now, and other than design and name she is nothing like her AI counterpart. She's so devoid of personality or development, and is even acts like less of a good person than the AI. The only reason we are given to like her is the connection to her AI. This also applies to her scenes with Hajime and GOOD LORD do they mess this up. Unlike the game, Hajime and Chiaki share zero chemistry, and we're supposed to buy it, like \"yeah, this is believable.\" As Hajime is reduced to a whiny angst machine, and have his entire motivation and character rewritten to revolve around her, a lot like the rest of the cast. Mukuro Ikusaba is now incestuous even though she was never like that, Izuru Kamukura had a good run up until the end where they utterly fucked it up, rewriting his motives for the sake of his waifu, and then there's Junko. Oh Junko. Once a charismatic, manipulative, and utterly horrifying demon, is now just a sadistic valley girl who ran into someone at the right place and time. They say she ended the world stealthily and quietly, but this girl is about as subtle as a trainwreck marching around with her plans in broad daylight, and building elaborate torture dungeons under the school that somehow nobody found. Even some of the new characters are poorly handled. Ryota Mitarai is written with such a lack of personality, and is only a plot device. I did not care about him or want to see him overcome hardship. In fact considering his contribution to the plot I would gladly punch him in the face. \\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\r\nAlthough it's not as gorgeous to look at as the Future Arc, and it has errors far too often, I enjoyed the animation and art direction. Plus bonus points for keeping the pink blood that Future Arc tossed away. I wouldn't call it amazing but it's certainly a likeable art style, and special points to the opening which looks amazing to start and then changes its coloring halfway through to a darker and more forbidding style. I love that.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe catchy opening, the lovely ambient music or Mukuros cover of Tsubasa wo Kudasai, is all pure ear candy and I love it. And the seiyuus for the Japanese cast do a lovely job (Although I haven't watched the full English dub so I can't speak for them.) I can't think of many complaints in this regard\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\r\nThis show is honestly hard to watch. Due to everything being in Junkos point of view from the second half forward all plot twists are told to us before they happen, and there were times I had to legitimately shut off an episode because oh my god, the games weren't exactly free of gruesome moments but they NEVER took it this far. It goes too far, and many of these scenes can be done without. There's also the pure anger that was felt watching something I love reduced to this god awful writing. There were episodes that were completely pointless, and the entire thing is so clearly written with such a lack of soul, it's hard to feel yourself getting to invested either\\n\\n\r\nOk, so this is that paragraph dedicated to that one plot point I was talking about. If you don't want to spoil yourself just scroll down to my overall. If not then... Here goes.\\n\r\nSo apparently Junko Enoshima did not make the Super Danganronpa 2 characters fall into despair one by one using her wit, charm, and power to lead anybody to Despair. She made them watch a brainwashing video! Haha... Hahaha (flips table) this isn't just lazy writing. This is something that utterly destroys so much of what the series has created. No longer do the struggles of the Danganronpa 2 characters to come to grips with their past selves, or the shock \"oh my god, they have done awful things.\" matter because they were brainwashed. No longer does the message of being able to change yourself even if you've done wrong, a story of redemption and growth, an amazing moral matter because the only way to do wrong is through brainwashing. No longer is Junko a powerful and fearful woman who charmed people to her side to do her bidding, an absolute menace able to drive anyone into Despairful madness enough to drag the world down. She brainwashed a bunch of kids to cause destruction without putting effort in, even though Despair is the one thing she WOULD put effort in. She loved proving that anyone can and will fall into despair, that hope is fleeting but I guess she doesn't care now and is just a splatter villain. This whole plot point is a mess and destroys so much of what the series stands for.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\r\nThis anime is an insult to the franichise I hold dearly, and a terrible send off to the Hopes Peak Saga. An amazing story suddenly turned into a terrible mess with one fell sweep. I could try saying something myself but I think Chisa Yukizome summarized the experience the best \"This is a tale of hope, that ends in Despair.\"",

            "content": "I usually don't write reviews, but I feel that this anime gets a lot of undeserved hate, for not being something that it doesn't need to be in the first place.  /*contains spoilers from DR 2 */\r\nStory and Plot:\r\nIn chronological order, this is the first part of of the whole series. It follows the cast of DR 2 in their last happy months and it shows the event of the Tragedy. I think this is a part that many people don't like, as some details of it contradict what was said in the games about it. However, in my opinion, this is actually betterthan what it was supposed to be. \\n\r\nFor example, in the games, they just say that Junko was Ultimate Despair, and that's it. I just couldn't fully think that just one person was able to end the world and, even more importantly, corrupt a whole class of Ultimates and Izuru Kamukura, the Ultimate Hope. This way, even if it's different, it makes sense and, in a way, is much better ( I will talk about that later ).\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\r\nI put those two together because I really don't know what to say about either. In particular, I enjoyed every moment of Izuru; he just has some sort of casual badassery, and I also liked his internal questioning of what he should do.\\n\r\nNow, about the soundtrack, it is ok in general. What I really want to talk about is the ending theme of the song. At the beginning, I just enjoyed it normally but, after THE death at the end of ep 10, the ending just pushed the acceleration of the feels truck to the max.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI can't talk too much about the characters without getting into spoilers, but I can say that I really enjoyed all of them. We find out a bit of new stuff about Junko and there's also another major new character from class 77.\\n\r\nOf course, Junko is as brilliant and hopeless as always, earning a well-deserved nr.1 spot on my \"top villains of all-time\" list.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI think that by this point it is clear that I love this anime, but there is one more very important thing about it that I haven't said.\\n\r\nFirst of all, this part of the series doesn't have any major plot twists, and what this story is about has been spoken from the beginning of it. \\n\r\nSo, instead of having the usual tone of the series, this anime emphasizes on the slow coming of the tragedy. Seeing the members of class 77 playing around brings me both a smile and a tear, thinking of what is to come.\\n\r\nAlso, what I enjoyed the most is the way that everyone's good intentions are manipulated and used against them. In several cases, if the characters didn't care about each other and just remained still, Junko's plan would have failed (in general, she always allows her victims a way to escape). However, exactly because they care and act, trying to bring happiness to themselves and others, the characters end up being manipulated by Junko and they fall.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while I understand that some people might not enjoy this series, I personally think it's one of the best parts of the franchise and give it a personal \"Why won't the tears stop\"/11   ( 11/11 )",

            "content": "Oh, my God.\r\nFirst off, play the games first + watch in broadcast order for full enjoyment. Personally I didn't and it didn't hinder my experience, but if you want the full experience you should do that.\r\n...God damn it, what are these, tears? Other than maybe a few minor problems, DR3-D is brilliant in showing that the (obvious) villain Junko Enoshima is the worst person alive. I can't say much about what she does because of immense spoilers, but know that she is evil going in. Not knowing any better, though, you could walk right in completely unaware of the nature of DR and think it'sa boring slice of life anime. It's not. Also, no spoilers, but bring a box of tissues for episode 10.\\n\\n\r\nAs to be expected from Danganronpa, the art is beautiful. So many things are so well animated, it's just impressive. There's nothing else I can say about it.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, as to be expected, the sound is brilliant. Kami-iro Awase, the opening song, is my favorite anime OP of all time. It's ambient and calm, but has an air to it within the lyrics that fits the classic DR theme of the ultimate hope vs. the ultimate despair. Zettai Kibou Birthday may pale in comparison, but is still incredibly enjoyable. The overall sound design is incredibly varied in tone and overall is very good.\\n\\n\r\nDR3-D technically goes in with the expectation that you know the characters, but you can still learn about them solely through the anime. Considering the size of the class, it does a fairly good job at introducing them all, and you'd know any one of them just by looking at them. Their designs are all unique and their personalities clash in interesting ways, making them entertaining to watch. Allow me to reiterate that Junko Enoshima is the worst human being to ever walk this earth.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I'm biased, but I love the shit out of this anime. It's mesmerizing how it seems so innocent going in, even if you HAVE played the games, but ends up crushing your soul.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9/10\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nChiaki Nanami - Crying/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Watch this series.

            "content": "I'm normally not one to write reviews, but this show is just so terrible that I had to.\r\nThis show is part of the Danganronpa 3 trilogy of anime, with this show being a prequel to the events of the first game, Future Arc serving as a sequel to the second game, and Hope Arc wrapping up the \"Hope's Peak Saga\". \r\nIt's really hard to explain what's wrong with this show without spoiling the entirety of it, but I'll try.\r\nThe plot is unbearably slow-paced for most of the show, with nearly everything important happening in the last few episodes. All the episodes before the final feware split between nonstop fanservice, which is charming for all of five minutes before you realize how the characters are acting like exaggerated stereotypes of themselves, and crossovers with Future Arc, which painfully progress the shows plot inch by inch.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, Class 77 are nearly all horribly written, acting like Persona Q-style caricatures of their characters in Danganronpa 2. I sure hope you didn't like any characters for their hidden depths and complexities, because all depth is gone in Despair Arc. All of the characters are hit hard by this, and some of them are completely ruined by this (Soda stands out to me, given that nearly every line out of his mouth in this show begins with \"Miss\" and ends with \"Sonia\".) The only character that escapes from this is the Imposter, with him having a much more interesting and compelling character in this show than in the second game. Sadly, he gets barely any time focused on him, since most scenes he's in are those where he's with the rest of Class 77, and it's hard for his more mellow personality to stand out with how loud many of the other characters are.\\n\\n\r\nThe new characters (Juzo, Mitarai, Munakata, and Chisa) are better, but they're not very important in this show, with them getting their time to shine in Future Arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is quite good, and the voice work is downright excellent in some parts, but that's always been one of the strengths of Danganronpa. The artwork, on the other hand, has very clearly been rushed, and coming back to this series after seeing the incredible artwork in V3 is jarring.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if these were the only problems the show would still be a disaster, but I wouldn't give it a rating as bad as 1. Sadly, though, there's a twist in the last few episodes that is so bad it ruins Danganronpa 2 retroactively. Sadly, I can't discuss it here because it spoils the entire show, but trust me in saying that it's incredibly disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully, though, so little happens in the show that it's very easy to read a summary to catch up. If you want to experience Danganronpa 3, I'd say watch Future Arc, then read a summary of this show, then finally watch Hope Arc. Neither of the other two shows are very good, but they're sure better than this.",

            "content": "Generally spoiler free review, might contain a reference or two about certain events. \r\nThis is a discussion on both arcs, Future and Despair, they are meant to be watched together. I have not played any of the games, and don\u2019t plan to since I\u2019ve given up gaming a long time ago, therefore I\u2019m not going to make any parallels. \r\nBoth shows are dark, while Despair progressively becomes darker with each episode, Future is dark from the very first minute of the first episode. The art style is similar, pink blood in some scenes, red blood in others, you get used to the pink blood andbecomes as gory as the red version. Character designs are nice and unique, sometimes confusing as to which is which especially in the Despair arc. There are a lot of characters so that\u2019s why.\\n\r\nThe future arc is interesting and ties really well with the despair arc especially in the end, it does have a few plot twists which are interesting, from a psychological point of view it does tackle large organizations and corruption within them if you want. \\n\\n\r\nThe despair arc is what I enjoyed the most, especially with the symbolism presented in there. If you watch closely and analyze some Junko Enoshima tactics, you will start to see them in real life (TV brainwashing, manipulating groups, idols that people listen to, etc). For me Junko Enoshima has become one of the best villains In anime, and if you look closely there is a bit of Junko Enoishima close to you every day. I also liked very much how the best guys suffer the most, it usually happens in our societies, they don\u2019t get impaled, hacked of course, but they do get cast aside by the bad guys. I like the symbolism behind despair, it\u2019s brilliant, you can extrapolate it into real life (weather it\u2019s a villainous political entity that wins or a certain event that happens that turns the world upside down, like war, etc). The ending of the Future arc is interesting, makes you think a bit about hope (good), despair (evil) and what is best. Sadly as in real life there is no good over evil or evil vs good winners here, we all kind of loose in some way. \\n\r\nMusic is fitting for this kind of show and does set the atmosphere for certain scenes. The art is interesting, quite dark in the Future arc, does give you the horror feel. \\n\\n\r\nPlot is well developed for the Despair arc, I really loved it, the Future arc\u2019s plot however left me with a bitter taste, it was a bit predictable towards the end, and I didn\u2019t quite like part of the ending. I won\u2019t be going into details so as not to spoil it, but I think the decision to bring back a certain character was driven by fear of fans reactions. I did like the character a lot but I would have liked the show more if I would have been depressed by the ending though. \\n\\n\r\nJunko Enoshima-chan, is the best villain. Now go despair and watch the series!\\n",

I just love the characters these characters are amazing, its just amazing with the reveals of them being the villians, its pretty interesting..... then theres this anime.\r\nI watched the first bit 3 episodes. Now thats it finished I was to lazy to watch all 11 because I don't want these characters ruined for me. I heard a lot of bad things about this seen a lot of cool and dumb scenes. I don't know itsjust dropped instantly for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is so screwed up beacuse they force in the future side to. So the whole thing of having A LOT of stuff in despair and future side. Is a problem. Like theres just to much. I just skipped right to the end nothing special. I don't know, Danganronpa they could of done a great story then a back story before the third game comes out. It would of made more money and even the spin off game if that got an anime. Its really not that hard, but of course they add in EVEN THE SPIN OFFS are in the future side. Its just a mess.\\n\\n\r\nIts sad to see a good game genre (not perfect) go down the drain because of the animes. If you are reading this and you haven't played the games.

            "content": "This entry (along with Mirai-hen) was made for those that have played the first two games of the series since this helps complete the series timeline. So keep in mind that since I can't spoil here but I'll do my best to make this a good review in my capabilities, if that makes any sense. So if you haven't played the 2nd game, go do so before watching this since just watching Danganronpa the Animation isn't going to help you here.\r\nStory: The premise is on the anime's page so you can go there for that. Anyways, this is the prequel to everything that has happenedto the series starting with class 77's road to hope up to the end of where they fall into despair. What I like about the story is that they may have it at an open ending but isn't that what a prequel is supposed to do? They nailed that aspect pretty well, I'm getting a little ahead of myself so I'll go back a little.\\n\\n\r\nThe series starts with like a typical high school anime then it slowly becomes darker the more that you watch. The execution itself was a bit rushed but also brilliant as the Danganronpa franchise perfectly handles despair as well as hope itself, the two being the main themes of this series.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 9/10 for the story\\n\\n\r\nThe art uses its character designs from the series overall which is something that I never had a problem with in all honestly. Lerche does a good job with matching the atmosphere with the tone of the show, which is something that studio does very well with some of the shows they worked on the past (ie Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace). The animation isn't nothing too special but it works well for the series as it doesn't need that. The backgrounds look very nice, but nothing too special.\\n\\n\r\nScore for the art: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is a bit hard to tell since I was a bit distracted of what was going on but the tracks were very good and they sound nice on their own which is a plus in my book. The OP theme is very good with not only having different versions as the show progresses, which helps fit the tone of the story and the vocals are perfect for it too. The ED theme on the other hand....is nice with the visuals showing the various good times that class 77 have together although Nagito isn't the best singer (his seiyu sings the ED).\\n\r\nThe voice acting was very well done as the seiyu gives out the best performances they have for the characters and not once have they failed at it, haven't seen the dub for this yet so I can't compare the two at the present time.\\n\\n\r\nScore for the sound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the same ones from Danganronpa 2, so it\u2019s about them, somewhat. A few characters that took their debut in this entry as well as in the future arc (ie Chisa Yukizome according to the Danganronpa wiki) did well to serve their purposes although only one of them being Yukizome got more screentime compared to the other two characters, this will be the last time I mention the future arc in this review, so I highly apologize if you were annoyed by that. What I meant by somewhat well, only Hinata, Nagito and Chiaki Nanami mainly got the focus. I liked how the characters kept their original personalities and vice versa so that\u2019s a plus, otherwise it would be very awkward for me to watch. Part of what the light hearted tone was due to how humorous the characters interacted with each other. The more you grew attached to the characters in Class 77, the harder it\u2019ll be when it comes towards the end of the anime when a certain event happens that I obviously won\u2019t spoil. \\n\\n\r\nThe three that get the most focus on do impact on the story in a large amount of ways without them realizing it for example of how Nanami gets her class to play some video games with her (that scene is one of my favorite scenes from the first half of this entry), which affects in how closer she gets with Hinata in their friendship as they talk more as they play video games. In a way this represents hope in the atmosphere in class 77 as the less time they interact with each other due to how things end up later, which ends up making the time of the despair even closer if that makes any sense. As for Nagito, well he is just Nagito doing his best to help his class which somewhat ends up backfiring, as he does hold an impact of how events go so I\u2019ll give him credit for that. Am I allowed to mention that Junko is part of this, otherwise why else would the title be called the \u201cDespair arc\u201d anyways, and she is not only entertaining but she also did a good job at going even further as an antagonist, I\u2019ll leave it at that before this gets ugly\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the character cast, as I didn\u2019t dislike anybody, although I do have a love-hate relationship with a certain character that doesn\u2019t appear much in this arc but it\u2019s good to mention that here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters get a score of a 9, as well...no cast can be perfect after all, when it comes to the Danganronpa franchise\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis may be written a bit differently compared to the other sections as well, I\u2019m not used to writing my enjoyment on something but rather than reading on my rambling I\u2019ll just be honest here. I really loved it. Now to be a bit more specific so this won\u2019t be as vague. For instance, I really liked the humor in the chances they got, I recall laughing a lot in the first two episodes due to the situations they got in. When the show became true to its name, I wasn\u2019t prepared for it as it gave me tears, I had to take a short break while watching episode 9 to calm myself down a bit before I continued.\\n\r\nI did find a lot of enjoyment from this series, but I think it\u2019s a bit hard to describe why I like this entry other than the fact that it\u2019s something you\u2019re going to have to try for yourself, it\u2019s best I got to say, I guess\u2026.\\n\r\nScore for enjoyment: a perfect 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did like this entry into the Danganronpa franchise. Sure it isn\u2019t perfect but that I think that\u2019s what it was trying to be as it was supposed to help fill in the holes that people would have after finishing a playthrough of Danganronpa 2. Simply put, if you want some questions answered, give this a shot just remember to play Danganronpa 2 first before giving this a watch. At the time of this review, the dub for this arc isn\u2019t finished.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: a solid 9/10",

            "content": "We all need a little bit of despair in our lives.\r\nThis is a review of Despair arc of Danganronpa 3, it will dive into some major spoilers, but only in the end, after a big \"SPOILERS BELOW\" tag. This is a show you should watch simultaneously with the Future arc, switching between an episode of future and despair in that order. This is a clever way to develop characters present in both arcs and is absolutely worth your effort. You need to play all the games (except V3) in order to understand what is going on, as it is, while a chronological prequel to allgames, relies heavily on your knowledge of the universe and future events. I prefer this arc to Future's, mostly as it focuses on characters of the 2nd Visual Novel.\\n\\n\r\nI'll start with praising the Opening, as I usually do. While the song itself didn't capture me as much as Future arc's, the colours and overall visuals are very accurately picked and have plenty of references both to future and present of characters (Like Nagito and the revolver barrel on the background). It has enough obvious spoilers, but it is a given, as the show expects of viewer to already know how where the story leads. That being said, there is plenty of unexpected turns along the way. The song is rather calm, only picking up the pace in the middle, with visuals of our heroes falling into despair. And frankly, the song itself is not filling you with hope either. Overall, a very good choice for an opening.\\n\\n\r\nLets talk about characters. We see all of main cast from the 2nd game, as well as some characters we just saw in the first episode of the Future arc. If you wanted more of the friendly shenanigans between the group that were present in the game, then you'll be very happy with those, especially first couple of episodes. There is not that much depth added to them compared to VN, and we only really see Chiaki's and Hajime's development, but, strangely, the focus of the anime is not as much on them as on Junko Enoshima. Yes, the queen is back, and we finally get to see how she caused the most tragic, despair inducing yada yada you get the idea. Her personality is perhaps the most interesting in the whole series, and it is always nice to see more of her. I can't say I fully agree with how her plan was handled, but I'll speak more about it in spoilers. The only major complaint I have to characters, is that there may be a bit too much sexualisation. The game had a lot of it, sure, but it just seems out of place here at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is on par with Future arc, perfectly presenting an atmosphere of the school life as well as some really despair\u2122 moments. I'll talk more about this specific moment in the spoiler section, but this is one of the few animes that made want to turn it off from how horrible the situation unfolding was, it was really hard to look at. It is all thanks to great animation and sound design.\\n\\n\r\nStory is... complicated to talk about without spoilers. All I can say, is that it gives you a lot of somewhat satisfying answers you may had, will you be happy with those answers is another question. I rather was, but there are still some things I wish were different. The story focuses heavily on Junko and her gang, and we see how remnants of despair were turned from hope.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, its a good prequel to games, with some parts being worse than others, while still being very enjoyable to watch and fall into despair because of. Its an objective 8 and subjective 9, so I'll round it up to 9. In the next section I'll discuss some plot elements and ending.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOkay, BIG SPOILERS BELOW (for Future Arc included) time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis arc does not have a happy ending, it even says so explicitly. I really enjoy being hurt by a show. Which is why I liked ReZero so much, for example. This show is really good at giving you despair even though you already know it will do something like that, and it is really subjective, but that might be a reason why I loved watching this so much. The way it gets to the point of utter despair is a bit questionable though. To address the elephant in the room. Brainwashing. That is not the best plot device and I wish Junko would just went full charisma on the class and turned them that way. But, I don't think there was a way for her to realistically do that. And that she brainwashed them, doesn't mean her character is invalid now, as she clearly turned the Monaka gang (from Ultra Despair Girls) by that charisma before. Brainwashing gave us A) an unexpected motive for murders in Future arc, B) a logical explanation to the events of the series, C) one of the most horrifying scenes I've seen, that being Chisa's brainwashing. The specific scene from ReZero had the same effect on me, and that scene was far more brutal. In this case, the sound and visuals vibrate with despair and horror and I loved that. But, even though the plot mostly makes sense it has a lot to be desired, as with all of the series, some things make 0 sense and should be accepted as facts (Like, why are student council members so stupid and didn't try shooting Junko from the start, resorting to going insane right off the bat, why is Kamukara so bland and goes along with everything, why Mitarai didn't at least try to do something, etc) The Ultimate Animator Mitarai is good as a character, but is lacking as a device Junko used to brainwash everyone. Talking about his brainwashing, I suspect that the reason why Opening has such a colour palette, is exactly because of how big of a role colours play in this story, which I honestly loved, but anyway. The ending to the arc is horrifying, with an army of brainwashed people storming the school they were once a part of (similar to Future arc's ending, don't you think?), and Chiaki's death was truly a heartbreaking moment. It is an ending that leads us straight to the events of the first game, with us even being showed how Junko's classmates helped her barricade the building they will be soon trapped in themselves. It is a nice ending, filled with despair, exactly what was needed from this story.\\n\r\nAlso, the ED is very heartwarming, with all of class's good memories together linking to Chiaki. Its just a good ED which makes sense from the future lore perspective, and I didn't want to skip it that often.",

I watched this crap expecting absolute trash and as it turns out YES IT IS. Yeah the animation and OST in particular are nice, but I can't believe how many asspulls this series had to do to get to desired conclusion. Moreover I liked the first few episodes (sadly like in every danganronpa, the plot consistency flies out of the window). But still the story of those games is just as bad and I'm way too invested in the overall plot, so I'll have tosit through the final season.\\n\\n\r\nPS: If you're doing danganronpa marathon watch this show. (I'm sure you know the story can't get any worse)",

            "content": "This review most likely contains a million spoilers from the Danganronpa series so here's a preemptive spoiler-less TL;DR : If you love the games and expect all your questions to be answered with solid, sensical information, the mystery left by the games is probably better than what you're going to get from this anime.\r\n##SPOILERS AHEAD MAYBE?##\r\nAfter playing the Danganronpa games, specially the first one, i was full of questions. I was excited, i had a ton of questions and i had huge expectation for the rest of the story. It was only natural, those games are pretty good and they even have decent endings soyou're left with great expectations after you beat them. Specially considering they feed you with little details about what happened in the past and why the hell the games are happening. They make you want more.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, when i got into this Despair anime i was stoked about it. I was finally going to get all the juicy details the games refused to give me. My expectations were probably a little too high but i couldn't really help it. I probably spent 50 or 60 hours playing the first two games and those games kept telling me about this mysterious, brutal, super interesting backstory that would finally explain it all, make it all clear. The whole picture.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, reality rarely meets expectations when it comes to anime.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time the Despair part of the anime ended i was feeling quite disappointed. I felt like i was cheated into watching just the kind of show that i don't enjoy watching. It felt like the amazing thing the games had going for them somehow turned into some average, lazy, edgy seasonal anime show. Nothing wrong with those kinds of shows really, they're just not the kind of thing i enjoy watching or what i consider \"good anime\". And that's just how this anime felt to me; edgy stuff happening for reasons because what did you expect? Explanations? Sensical developments? Look somewhere else.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, i was probably expecting a little too much from the backstory but at the very least i wanted some sensical explanations and some legit, organic character development for the despairs, specially for Junko. I mean, by the end of the second game you know a lot about Monokuma but you barely know Junko, even though they're pretty much the same character. I know a lot of fans of the series love the character and come up with explanations for everything she does and doesn't but to me it's all just the same old bull; anime fans trying to find obscure meanings and explanations where there's only cheapness and laziness from the writers.\\n\\n\r\nJunko's ultimate title might as well be \"The Ultimate Plot Armor\". She's basically Felix Felicis incarnate. They tell you her talent is being analytical but there's tons of things they never explain how she does and why she's capable of doing. At times it just seems like she can see the future and know things there's no way she could've known. She seems to know about medicine and apparently can also learn stuff really fast and replicate it. She seems to have better detective skills than the Ultimate Detective and better luck than the Ultimate Luck. Up until the very end of the first game (could be argued being defeated and killed was also part of her perfect plans all along though) everything she does goes perfectly right even though people around her had tons of chances to ruin her plans or even stop her. She always has boxes of stuff to blackmail people (don't even get me started on the blackmail materials, they're the stupidest things ever), people that makes no sense that she even knew existed to begin with so it makes even less sense that she has intimate details about their lives and even their families lives. Who or when takes all these photos, videos, audios, collect the data, etc? Who knows? Who cares? Clearly not the writers. It's just another super convenient part of the Junko character. Like many of the things she does, it just happens and you shouldn't think about it because that's rude.\\n\\n\r\nShe brainwashes people by showing them videos and apparently introducing some metal things into their brains. Just like that, no infections, no bleeding, no operating room, it's alright, it's not rocket science people, she doesn't even need to do it herself, the one doing this is the Ultimate Soldier who should not know anything about introducing stuff into someone's brain, she reads some instructions and just does it. Easy. The whole brainwashing thing isn't consistent either. Sometimes she uses the video of the student council massacre and sometimes she uses the monokuma theater. She brainwashed the despairs by showing them a live stream of the Ultimate Gamer dying. How did she manage to use the brainwashing animation techniques in a live stream is never explained though. Add it to the list of things that Junko should't be able to do but still manages to do in the end because of reasons.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course Junko couldn't be the character she is without this whole story happening in one of these stereotypical anime iterations of Japan where there's no government, no police and teenagers have easy access to weapons and can kill people without consequences, hell, at one point Junko leaves a bomb in a taxi and makes it explode and nobody gives a flying flock about it. Stuff like this happens in Japan all the time i guess.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, if i'd known this anime was going to ruin the concept i had of the games, i would've avoided watching it. I wish someone had told me so at least i was prepared for the suckotash.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's bad specially if you're a fan of the games and expected the same kind of quality. I guess people who love edgy anime that makes no sense and offers little explanations for anything that happens could like it though.",

            "content": "Note 1: MAJOR SPOILERS FOR THE DR2 GAME AND DESPAIR ARC ANIME! DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE CHECKED THEM OUT!\r\nNote 2: This review is going to be an in depth evaluation about the Dangan Ronpa 2 game AND the Despair arc anime. It will be divided into the two sections. Skip to Section 2 (Despair arc) if you're only interested in that. \r\nNote 3: This is a continuation of my previous review. DON'T READ THIS UNTIL YOU AT LEAST KNOW THE STRUCTURE OF MY DANGAN RONPA REVIEWS.\r\nhttps://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=232992\r\n----------------------\r\nHeya. It's me, Tim. If you've read my Dr1 review, you're in for another fucking ride. That's right, people.Dangan Ronpa 2 is PRECISELY why Dr1 doesn't have a perfect score. The sequel features a much more developed cast, coupled with several characters that have rather eccentric personalities. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, this review will be dedicated in bashing the seiyu while praising the English voice acting to no end, much like my Dr1 review.\\n\\n\r\n----------Section 1: Dangan Ronpa 2 review------------------\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDangan Ronpa 2 is the BEST DR game to date. Smarter killers make it more difficult to pinpoint the blackened in the class trials, which also explain why the average duration of each trial is now increased to 2.5 hours (as opposed to Dr1 trials, which are 1.5 hours on average)... if you know what you're doing, and given that none of the voice acting is skipped. On the contrary, if you're playing this game blind, chances are that you'll take more than 3 hours to complete a trial.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDetailed in previous review.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nView my Dr1 review regarding the OST. Dr2 has several new tracks combined with Dr1 tracks, and they all blend in well perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto our FAVORITE SECTION of the entire review... let's thrash and diss the seiyu's performances!\\n\\n\r\nJapanese voice acting: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nIn Dangan Ronpa 2, instead of Makoto, we now have Hajime Hinata as the protagonist. Unlike his classmates, Hajime's talent was not revealed at the very beginning. As a matter of fact, Hajime does NOT have a talent, as revealed in Chapter 4 by Nagito Komaeda. Hajime has been cited many times as a \"typical, ordinary and talentless\" reserve course student (ie. Students that had to pay a HIGH tuition fee to attend regular school courses as opposed to the Ultimates' schoolife). Due to Hajime's characterization (and personality), I have every single reason to believe that his seiyu is seriously and motherfuckingly miscast. BIG TIME. Arguably the hugest miscast in the ENTIRE Dangan Ronpa series. Let's identify the identity of Hajime's seiyu, shall we? Her name is Minami Takayama, best known as the voice of Conan from Case Closed. Like with Megumi (oh boy, you're about to find out about her too later on), I'm going to detail EVERY SINGLE GROWN/ADOLESCENT MALE ROLE THAT SHE BUTCHERED.\\n\\n\r\n1) Mikey Kudo (Digimon Fusion - Nicolas Roye in dub)\\n\\n\r\n2) Dilandou Albatou (Escaflowne - Joel McDonald in Funimation dub)\\n\\n\r\n3) Pit (Kid Icarus - Antony Del Rio in dub)\\n\\n\r\n4) Luke (Pokemon - Billy Bob Thompson in dub)\\n\\n\r\n5) Yong Hwa (Pretty Rhythm: Dear my Future - Eric Christopher Chow in Chinese dub)\\n\\n\r\n6) Hao Asakura (Shaman King - Sebastian Arcelus in dub)\\n\\n\r\n7) Nataku (Tsubasa - Chris Burnett in dub)\\n\\n\r\n8) Hijiri Minase (Descendants of Darkness - Sam Riegel in dub)\\n\\n\r\n------------\\n\\n\r\nOk, though Minami butchered less roles than Megumi, she still fucked up a couple of them, and that's no good. I'm pretty damn sure that Hajime is the worst performance out of all of them. Think about it for a sec - Hajime is supposed to represent ordinarity, plainness, normalcy and typicality. The fact that Minami was cast as Hajime is setting up a very, very bad precedent - it means that even women are deemed suitable to voice as typical, (keyword: TYPICAL; not whiners, not effeminate guys nor crossdressers) and I mean TYPICAL MALE TEENS. The aforementioned are also suited to be voiced by grown males though, given if those are male tenors. Way to fucking go, Japan. Are you trying to make male VAs lose their jobs by letting women do a way inferior job at pretending to be a male teen, and epically failing at it, above all else? \\n\\n\r\nLUCKILY, we have Johnny Yong Bosch (Lelouch, Ichigo and Renton, etc.) as the English voice of Hajime. Besides the three roles that I've just mentioned, he's also known as several other main characters. Look him up and watch any show he's in. You're bound to be impressed with his performances. In any case, although Hajime is talentless, his strong grasp of hope and bluntness are precisely what saved the surviving Dr2 cast from despair; they were all able to log out of the game with their in game personalities retained thanks to Hajime. Dr2 proves that you don't need talent to succeed; if you have enough hope, you too could turn into a Super Saiyan and banish despair once and for all; Johnny really nailed that aspect of Hajime, along with all his other attributes. \\n\\n\r\n-------------\\n\\n\r\nNext on the shitlist is.... a middle aged woman that is nearly applicable for elderly welfare, she's none other than Megumi Ogata! Yes, people. You guessed right - I can't believe that she got yet another role in the Dangan Ronpa series, and butchering it even more than she did with Makoto. Megumi played as Nagito Komaeda. To be honest, she barely sounded like a guy most of the time. All I hear is a grandma-esque voice trying too hard to go low to sound male. Uggggh. Just... view my previous review if you wanna know how much I hate Megumi, and my lack of respect for this constantly miscast woman.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Bryce Papenbrook, whom previously voiced as Makoto, pulled off the resident hope obsessed psychopath exactly how he's meant to be. Those brilliant crazy ass laughs are very, and I mean very astonishing. Bryce was also able to portray a soft spoken Nagito before the character took a psychopathic spin. Given that Nagito is a complicated character, Bryce also managed to nail Nagito's aggressive side when he found out that he's one of the Remnants of Despair. Bryce's performance as Nagito as a whole is just more than merely impressive. He completely got Nagito right for exactly what he is - a crazy, boisterous (soft spoken in facade), sarcastic and hope obsessed freak.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is a major step up in characterization in Dr2. Several characters have way more interesting personalities, notably (besides the characters I've mentioned above): \\n\\n\r\n-Gundam: Very hammy, eccentric and dramatic\\n\\n\r\n-Hiyoko: Local bitch alongside being extremely insulting; overall a trashy person\\n\\n\r\n-Mikan: Severe lack of self esteem, and due to being bullied too much, finally freaking snapped in Trial 3 when contracted with the Despair Disease\\n\\n\r\n-Ibuki: ADHD\\n\\n\r\n-Sonia: Royalty\\n\\n\r\n-Chiaki: Derpy Kyoko\\n\\n\r\n-Fuyuhiko: Yakuza with anger management issues\\n\\n\r\n-Nekomaru: SHIT!\\n\\n\r\n-Mahiru: Feminist\\n\\n\r\n-Peko: Cold assassin and JUSTICE!\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nOh boy, did I just say that more than half of the Dr2 cast is notably good? That's precisely the point, though - Dr2's cast is way more intriguing and developed than its predecessor. \\n\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNuff said. You can't go wrong with so many memorable characters. New features added to this sequel makes it so much more enjoyable as well - Logic Dive and Rebuttal Showdown are fun minigames.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDr2 is constantly shown to be the best Dr2 game ever known to mankind, and for a very damn good reason too. Play it yourself and you'll get what I mean.\\n\\n\r\n------------------Section 2: Dangan Ronpa - Despair arc review----------------\\n\\n\r\nNote: In this section, I'll also be comparing English voices in the character category.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Despair arc serves to answer many of the questions left unanswered in the games. It details the lives of the Dr2 cast before they were plunged into despair by Junko; they were all forced to witness real life Chiaki dying right in front of them. It also explains and elaborates how one exactly falls into despair - either through witnessing gruesome massacres or excessive brainwashing; using the target's darkest memories against them. We all know that Junko Enoshima is the mastermind behind all the events that occur in the Dangan Ronpa series, but Despair arc clarifies how exactly she goes about succeeding her goals until they were thwarted by Makoto in Dr1.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDespair arc is a brilliant tie up to unanswered questions. Its occasional comedy is excellently executed as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNeed I say more?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nA couple of tracks were recycled from the games, which is a good decision because the Dr3 anime as a whole is meant to be watched by Dangan Ronpa fans. Either way, the soundtrack is marvellous.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWould have given it a perfect score if the Funimation stand ins were nearly as good as their game counterparts. Besides that, the lack of consistency with game precedents and English terminology are also things to be upset about. What I mean by that is the Eng dub of Despair arc using last names instead of first, and SHSL as opposed to Ultimate. Geez, I hate inconsistency among everything else. The acting is good though, I'll give Funimation's dub that.\\n\\n\r\nNatsumi Kuzuryu, whom is Fuyuhiko's sister is further expanded in the Despair arc. We finally find out WHY she was killed rather than just HOW she was killed. Think about it: If you repeatedly torment others and threatening to inflict harm to them, someone's bound to get pissed. In which case, Sato got pissed big time and ended Natsumi's life with a swimsuit wrapped with gravel (this was revealed in Dr2). Serves Natsumi right, to be honest - she really shouldn't have tried to threaten Mahiru, given the latter's friendship with Sato. And we all know what happened to Sato later on - Fuyuhiko murdered her in vengeance. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, Mukuro also makes an appearance, and we finally get to see her in her true personality (and appearance), rather than her pretending to be Junko. In the Despair arc, Mukuro infiltrates Hope's Peak with Junko as the Ultimate Soldier. Mukuro is shown to be a very submissive twin sister, whom does exactly as Junko commands her to; she is shown to exhibit great pleasure in following Junko's orders, even going as far as to masochistically indulge in Junko's attempts in injuring or killing her. Other than that, Mukuro's behavior is what you'd expect from a model soldier - she is the no-nonsense Despair Sister whom follows Junko's demands to the letter.  \\n\\n\r\nIn any case, let's begin the voice compare, along with some differences I've noticed in the reprisals. \\n\\n\r\n-Fuyuhiko Kuzuryu-\\n\\n\r\nGame voice: Derek Stephen Prince\\n\\n\r\nAnime voice: Aaron Dismuke\\n\\n\r\nDerek is known for several roles, mostly witty characters such as Vexen (Kingdom Hearts), Uryu (Bleach) and Ken (Digimon 02). Fuyuhiko is a very foul mouthed rotten apple, and clearly, that kind of characterization is playing against type. Not that it's a problem, to be honest. Derek is a VERY good actor, and he nailed Fuyuhiko to an effing T. The constant aggression that the character commonly exhibits and desperation before Peko was sent off for execution are attributes that are constantly praised, even by those that commonly prefer subs. As a result, Aaron had VERY BIG SHOES TO FILL IN, and sad to say, he falls short. Sure, Aaron may have been a good Alphonse, but guess what? He wasn't that great of a Fuyuhiko. Aaron's portrayal wasn't nearly as aggressive as that of Derek's, and that isn't a good thing at all. Sad to say, Aaron barely did the character justice. I vote Derek as best Fuyuhiko voice.\\n\\n\r\n-Akane Owari-\\n\\n\r\nGame voice: Wendee Lee\\n\\n\r\nAnime voice: Morgan Garrett\\n\\n\r\nAkane is a brawny big chested girl who is very impulsive, and prefers to resort to violence than peacefully sorting out situations with words. Wendee nailed those aspects of Akane, along with giving her a very suiting voice. I'm kinda disappointed with Morgan's portrayal - I don't like how Akane sounded lower pitched, along with lacking the energy that could be heard in Wendee's portrayal. I mean, I know Akane isn't supposed to be a moe girl or anything, but seriously, Morgan just gave Akane an overly low voice, and I found it to be unfitting.\\n\\n\r\n-Teruteru Hanamura-\\n\\n\r\nEng voice: Todd Haberkorn\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Todd reprised the role, he gave Teru a country accent even when he's speaking normally. As far as I'm concerned, Teru intentionally HIDES his accent to make it seem like that he's from a high class suburb. Shame on you Funimation - for not doing your homework.\\n\\n\r\n-Peko Pekoyama-\\n\\n\r\nGame voice: Janice Kawaye\\n\\n\r\nAnime voice: Clarine Harp\\n\\n\r\nAlright, no more favoring Californians this time around. This time, I'll choose the Texan Clarine. Clarine gave Peko more character (even though she's generally distant and calm) and a much more fitting deeper voice. Although I prefer Clarine's portrayal, I do have to give props to Janice for pulling off her Sparkling Justice persona - now that was simply just amazing!\\n\\n\r\n-Ibuki Mioda-\\n\\n\r\nGame voice: Julie Ann Taylor\\n\\n\r\nAnime voice: Brina Palencia\\n\\n\r\nJulie. Nuff said. Ibuki, as far as I'm concerned, is hyperactive and eccentric. Julie got those attributes down, but sadly, I'm afraid I can't quite say the same for Brina. Brina's portrayal was... bland. There just simply wasn't enough energy compared to Julie's take.\\n\\n\r\n-Gundam Tanaka-\\n\\n\r\nGame voice: Chris Tergliafera\\n\\n\r\nAnime voice: Scott Frerichs\\n\\n\r\nI choose Chris. Scott's take was around the same pitch as Chris's portrayal, but the entire composure of Gundam is his eccentricity and hamminess. I'm sorry, but Scott wasn't nearly as dramatic as Chris. Chris also had better shouts and generally gave a much more believable performance than Scott.\\n\\n\r\n-Usami-\\n\\n\r\nGame voice: Rebecca Forstadt\\n\\n\r\nAnime voice: Anastasia Munoz\\n\\n\r\nRebecca, because her voice for Usami was much more tolerable. Usami is a majorly annoying character either way, but a more soothing voice just makes the character less intolerable, you get what I mean? Anastasia is by no means a bad actress, but her Usami voice is just so awful that I was tempted to mute my tablet whenever she spoke. Seriously, Ana's other roles are much better than this.\\n\\n\r\n----------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nShould be pretty obvious by now. Flaws are listed above on what's keeping this dub from getting a perfect score.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI would have probably given this dub a 10/10 if there weren't any inconsistencies.",

            "content": "Just so you know where my review is coming from, I've never actually played any of the games myself, but I have watched all of CinamonToastKen's playthroughts of all of the Danganronpa games by the time I finally got around to watch the anime, so I was pretty up to speed on all of the events. Also, although I didn't really fell in love with the first game or its characters (although I did enjoy it a lot), it was the second Danganronpa that really did it for me. The story was amazing and the characters themselves were fantastic, to the point where I wastoo emotionally invested in all of them and wanted to know more than the game told us about them (though part of me thinks it's because the second game has a lot of underlying ships than the first one, to be honest). And that's when I stumbled upon this anime, so my review is biased, without a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I know you're supposed to watch both this arc and the future arc alternated (which I did, mind you), I'm only going to focus my review on this arc because it was my favourite. If you love the characters from the second game and you also wanted to know more about the actual story (you don't learn anything major, but you do get more details that polish up the entire Danganronpa universe), then you're going to love this. Even if the cast isn't your favourite of the two, I think it's worth watching if you're a fan of the whole concept of Despair in this universe, to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nOne warning though, especially towards the last few episodes, you get into some seriously messed up scenes. It is really not for the faint of heart and they're both extremely graphic and not at all at the same time, since everything happens sort of off screen so you don't get the full picture, but you know exactly what's going on. This arc, more so than the future one, is heavier on both the gore and the psychological side of Danganronpa's special kind of horror, which I really enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're looking to delve even further into this universe, you have to watch this. Even though we all know how it's going to end, considering this is a prequel of the whole universe the games showed us, it's still full of twists and heartache and it's one of the best times I had within the Danganronpa universe.",

It would have been perfect if it only got more explanation so it could've been the greatest prequel of the final trilogy of Danganronpa.\r\nThe story is, well to sum it up is pretty laking, we only got a few explanation about the tragedy and that's kinda it. You might say that it's a slice of life anime that ends up very badly. Kinda reminded me of some other anime in a way. \r\nThe characters are of course still enjoyable and funny as always. We actually know a little bit more about Chisa sinceher umm... yea. She's still my favorite character in DR3 though. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's an average anime for the people who want to know more about the tragedy but won't get any added explanation about the previous games.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "lots of spoilers\r\nI quite like the first couple episodes because it was refreshing to see the DR2 gang together again without a care in the world. Honestly, I probably wouldn\u2019t mind a slice of life anime with just the Danganronpa students (well, minus a few of the really, really stupid ones). Anyway, I really didn\u2019t like how it transitioned from a happy-go-lucky setting to sudden chaos and destruction. Junko somehow meets Ryoto (by this so called \u201cfate\u201d\u2026yeah, more like asspulling at its finest), and somehow makes a brainwashing anime which is totally unrealistic and unconvincing, yet the anime still went along with it. Instead ofshowing the characters gradually sink into murderous villains (and we didn\u2019t even end up seeing their heinous acts), they were magically transformed into spawns of the devil! And the audience is supposed to just accept that? Yeah, no. Oh I did like the Chiaki death scene though, I would say that was the only event in the anime that actually did a decent job of pushing someone from hope to despair.",

            "content": "!!!SUPER SUPER WARNING!!!\r\nIF YOU PLAN ON WATCHING THIS ANIME (or even reading my review) YOU NEED TO HAVE PLAYED/WATCHED THE FIRST DANGANRONPA GAME/ANIME AND HAVE PLAYED THE SECOND DANGANRONPA GAME.\r\nDanganronpa 3 \u2013 The End of Hope's Peak Academy \u2013 Despair Arc (holy fuck what a mouthful) is a prequel to the second Danganronpa game. You absolutely need to be caught up on what happens in the games in order to fully understand what is going on in this anime. What the anime accomplishes is a fun and despair filled experience that will help tell the tale of our gifted class.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nAs you hopefully alreadyknow, this anime revolves around the class that we interacted with in the second game. We are given a spotlight on how the class interacted with each other before the horrible killing event that destroyed not only Hope's Peak Academy but also most of the world. The one thing that is really holding me back on enjoying this prequel is the pacing. We start out at a good pace but then things start rushing once the first despair event comes into play. There is also a huge time skip early on that does not help with the pacing issue. Then once the anime hits its stride, it ends. The ending events just come so quickly that I found it hard to fully invest in the actions happening on screen.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI one hundred percent love the art-style. It mends very well with what I remember in the game save for Akane's and Ibuki's character models. For some reason they just look...off from what I remember from the game. The architecture is very appealing, the background shots are detailed, the eyes are of course awesome, and the characters look and move great on screen. There is a very good sense of fluid action (even though there really isn't a whole lot of action scenes).\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: I forgot to mention how awesome the OP is. It changes as the season comes closer to the end which is a really cool touch. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThey thankfully did not butcher the music from the first and second game. It is used very well in the anime in key spots as well as in non-critical scenes. Also hot damn that opening song is amazing. The voice actors retain their likeness from the games especially Junko. Overall it was a very pleasing anime to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSo due to the pacing issues I brought up in the story section the characters do feel a little flat. Some of them get a huge spotlight but a lot of them really get sidelined. Regardless though these characters do feel like their counterparts in the second game (which is a good thing). Junko however completely steals the spotlight even though she does not appear until the halfway point of the anime. Her character is just all over the place and it is just a joy to watch her inflict despair on everyone. Bonus points for another certain female character that of course steals the scene once she arrives (you know who I'm talking about).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to not over-score this anime since it really is one for the fans of the games. If you watch it without playing the games (WHICH IS A REALLY BAD IDEA DON'T DO IT) then you will probably be lost and think it is average. For the fans though I think that the anime does a pretty good job of expanding our knowledge of what we already knew. The show is not perfect (due to pacing and sidelined characters) but it is very far way from average. Great acoustic qualities, amazing visual presentation, and amazing despair make this anime a must watch for the fans of the game.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.4/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "So to start off, I have not played any of the games/read any of the manga, I have only seen the anime adaptation so this is my view of the anime as a newcomer to Danganronpa.\r\nI will cover some spoilers so you have been warned(although by the time I've seen the anime is already long past the hype and relevance so lol).\r\nI also like to start ratings at 5/10 and either increase or decrease from there.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThis is all about the Hope Peak's 77th class, and how they became the Remnants of Despair. They do. All of the kids have a super fancy skill includingthe one super muscly dude who blew up half a building die to his...trip to the bathroom?? True story. And they are all normal humans. Another guy is a good cook and a pervert who ends up doping the class with a date-rape drug so that made this awkward if I were to watch this with other people. \\n\\n\r\nJunko is also super OP and evil and also breaks the fourth wall a few times. She causes the apocalypse after she kidnaps a guy who says \"I love anime\" many times and a guy who was a loser who signed up to become a human experiment after he wanted to be less of a loser and uses their abilities to brainwash the masses and slaughter a bunch of high schoolers.(not necessarily in order, although the slaughtering high schooler's thing repeats a few times)\\n\\n\r\nJunko has a twin sister who has a kink for getting treated like dirt by Junko, she actually gets screen time here instead of the first Danganronpa animation as she gets killed off in the first episode there.\\n\\n\r\nHinata is the loser guy who gets to be the embodiment of \"Hope\" and gets long hair and red eyes as a result, he also gets regrets when his almost girlfriend dies tragically, causing all the class to become brainwashed people full of DESPAIR. \\n\\n\r\nDespair breaks the world as the result of one teenager brainwashing a bunch of kids and then society collapses pretty quick. Too bad for the world I guess, you tried?\\n\\n\r\n...That's pretty D E S P A I R - I N D U C I N G\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nA much lighter tone then the Future arc, although it gets darker as the story progresses in colour and subject matter. Also there's pink blood again, definitely nicer to look at then if there was red blood.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fine although I 'm pretty sure the gymnast girl isn't wearing a bra and her boobs would be slapping her in the face more often.\\n\\n\r\nNothing really bad or crazy good, it's decent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was pretty good, I rather liked the softer tone it had, plus the nice pastel-looking visuals. I also really liked the kind of mumble/voice speaking at the beginning.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was decent as well, I also don't remember much about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe point of this arc was to explain the characters/motivation of the Future arc, and it did a decent job. It felt rather long and plot-dependance heavy throughout the middle to end, as in the character's interactions were not present enough nor interesting enough without following the actual plot of and Junko's planning of \"The Most Despair Inducing Event in History etc\" to be good enough on their own.\\n\\n\r\nThe students all felt pretty one-dimensional, other then how they tried to develop the gamer chick Chiaki Nanami although she didn't really have enough of a personality for that so it felt forced. Also Hinata, although he was pretty boring before and after he became the embodiment of Hope.\\n\\n\r\nAlso wow you know Kyosuke, Chisa Yukizome and Juzo Sakakura are important and have deep backstories because they get a decent amount of screentime as well as they spy on people to get answers and want to create an ideal world. Also Sakakura turns out to be gay for Kyosuke and wants to stay in the closet so bad he lets Junko plunge the world into Despair. Glad they developed his character well enough for me to care. Oops.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis actually tried to explain things and cover a lot of plot, and I appreciate that. I just don't appreciate how it all turned out, it dragged in the middle and they didn't make me care enough about the characters and their relationships to believe how affected they all were by Nanami's death. Also no way she would have lived that long (JUST long enough to break down Hinata/Izuru Kamukura's emotional walls to make him cry) after being impaled that many times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOne scene that stuck with me was when Junko forced one random bg character into sawing his own head off, that was messed up. This reminds me of a certain Holme's ability to brainwash anyone after talking to them...COUGHeurusCOUGH\\n\\n\r\nAlso I felt the quippy \"we don't have enough screentime for this\" lines were a bit much. Also the whole Ryota Mitarai thinking \"all because I like anime\" like, too many times for too many \"serious\" moments.",
