            "content": "There's been a lot of strange series that debuted in 2012. If there was another to name, one would definitely be Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse. No, it's not the end of the year (yet) for us but in the world of the Total Eclipse, it's walking down that path. The series is based off a LN (light novel) of the same name and takes place in a science fiction world where mecha, aliens, and hot women with suits of iron dominating the series. It's definitely not everyday that you get to see chicks fighting otherworldly beings and still getting the time to relax. Let's lookand see for ourselves what Muv Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse has to offer:\\n\\n\r\nThe series is set in an alternative timeline where our planet Earth has been invaded by aliens forces known as the BETA. This sort of genre can be traced into many science fiction series such as Strike Witches, Gunparade March, and even Neon Genesis. The BETA has caused the Earth resistance to develop jet/mecha hybrid called Tactical Surface Fighters or TSF to eradicate them. Mankind now is in a state of war, horror, and survival where the skies rains with blood and the ground leaves the scars of battles. Muv Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse focuses on the exploration of these battles, characters' interactions, and the survival of mankind. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode isn't what we might expect. When I watched it, there's seems to be a sort of \u201cmindfuck\u201d reaction. In fact, it's not what most of us expected but a rather dark flashback with Yui in her final days of high school. To be honest, high school is never too fun for most people but in Yui's case has gotten that much grimmer. In a tragic twist, she is forced into immediate combat with her classmates for the first time against the powerful BETA. And with that, blood is spilled with a brutality of violence is presented to the viewers. If you thought this was a show about hot girls doing hot things, then think again. \\n\\n\r\nFrom there though, everything shifts to present time and we get to see the other characters of the series. It seems Yui has become that much more confident and with her status now as lieutenant. Starring opposite her though is the ever stubborn, short-tempered, confident Yuuya Bridges. He is of the Japanese American descent who follows his roles a strong soldier against the forces of the BETA. His short temper and characteristics forms a barrier between most of the other characters in the beginning with him presenting an attitude of \u201cdon't fuck with me\u201d personality. \\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of personalities, this series mixes in different characters with different characteristics. Let's take for example:\\n\\n\r\nThe Scarlet Twins - \\n\r\nCryska \"Scarlet Twin\" Barchenowa who is of the Soviet descent has a cold personality and is afraid to let people get close to her because the state of her mentality. She is the cold beauty of the series with an equally cold ability to fly the unfriendly skies of the series and doing what she does best. On the other hand, we got Inia \"Scarlet Twin\" Sestina. She is Cryska's most precious individual (and \u201csister\u201d) in that twisted world . Unlike Cryska though, Inia is much more gentler and treats other people with kindness especially Yuuya who she adores like an older brother. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in the series has different personalities as well. Tarisa Manandal, whom Yuuya teasingly calls her Chobi acts as the more comedic side of the series despite some of the more serious violence tone going on around. Later on, we also meet Cui Yifei, a pilot of the Chinese descent that brings out the inner tsundere from Yui. \\n\\n\r\nThese lovely ladies all have their different personalities but the show occasionally tries to hard. For example, some of the filler episodes involving the beach and the onsen presents us nothing more than just pure fan-service that's irrelevant to the story. Furthermore, the women of the series are drawn in a way that reflects their figures directly to the viewers with those tight suits. Who can forget those suits honestly? I bet most people here watched the trailer and added it to their PTW just from that. \\n\\n\r\nThere is more than just beyond the fan-service though for this rather underrated series. As more episodes progressed, we can see a more political side of Total Eclipse involving the various genetic heritages of the main characters. The nickname \u201cJapanese Doll\u201d given by Yuuya Bridges to Yui serves as a comedic but also political reference to his personality towards the race. The other characters' heritages also strikes a distinguishing background for the series that makes it more realistic despite being a science fiction. \\n\\n\r\nThe series traces its roots with the survival of the fittest theme although it doesn't involve any game elements. Instead, it's a military type series that involves with one force and the other. There can only be one winner on each side: mankind or the BETA. As such, the battles in the series are often intense when they happen that draws the violence, brutality, and blood from the skies. The characters drawn are visually presented well and gets their points across. However, the mecha department lacks a bit of this quality. Although crisp, the mecha themselves seems to be trying too much to become..mecha. However, the emotions and drama mixed in is a surprisingly exciting watch. It shows the dangers mankind have been and will be facing. \\n\\n\r\nYet despite the serious tone of the series, there is a lot of interactions between the main characters later on. For later on, Yuuya becomes less aggressive and more caring towards his colleagues treating them as friends rather than comrades. His interaction with Yui is one of the more dynamic focuses in the series as he inspires her that she can create a path the way she wants. This opened up new doors of opportunities for a more caring relationship between the two. Hmm, maybe not because it seems that there are also other women interested in Yuuya. In some of the later episodes, Yuuya becomes the center of attention who attracts the attention of the many other female characters in the series. It's funny in a strange way to realize that in such a dark atmosphere that the BETA has already created, there can also be some space for fun and laughter. \\n\\n\r\nAs said before, the artwork of the series is presented in a way that reflects the more serious tone of the Muv Luv world in which survival of mankind depends on these new generation of trained pilots. The pilots themselves are drawn well and those tight suits the ladies wear are the eye candies. On the other hand, the mecha drawn are less than average and focuses too much on themselves. They are just there for the military purposes of battling the BETA with not too many special characters. The BETA themselves however gives off that alien invasion like feeling with their artwork designs of the horns, teeth, stingers, etc. Their behavior in the series shows that they are there to invade and expects nothing less than a fight to the death. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall music/soundtrack for the series is above par but sometimes tries to be too forceful.  \"Go to the top\" by Kumi Koda  shows a montage of all the main characters as well as a few glances of the vicious BETA. Some of the more emotional flashbacks gives off a soft melody that reflects the sadness of the Muv Luv world. A few of the characters went through a harsh past and it ultimately made them who they are today. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Muv Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse is one of those mecha series where it tries to balance out the grim reality of the war and the drama between the main characters. The reality of the war is there as we can see from Yui's past and what she has gone through. But at the same time, there is new hope as she finds new friends and allies to move on from that past. Yuuya's interactions with the other characters also shows that he is a caring person rather than just an obnoxious self-centered pilot as some of us believed him to originally be. There is also the blushing, the potential romance, as well as what is in hope for a better future. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Muv Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse is an underrated series that some of us may have looked past this year. Perhaps if we faced a more harsher reality in today's world, we might become more self aware. But it's worth giving it a shot especially if you're digging into some science fiction drama. \\n",

            "content": "Mecha anime is sometimes for most of people would avoid this one like me. It isnt about taste matter but sometimes we find mecha anime tends to be boring and repetitive. Like, they always about battle, battle and battle. They just focussing on that matters without leaving characters to develop. But back then, i am being suggested to watch Muv Luv Alternative and i must said, it was a great experience\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nMuv Luv Alternative Total Eclipse or should i say, Muv Luv. Is one from many anime that taking mecha as their main themes. But the differences between them, is they didnt focus about mechavs mecha like gundam. but its more about Mecha vs Alien. in this anime, we called alien as BETA. The story goes when The \"BETA\" has invaded on the earth. As the humanity is on the edge, UN and Japanese Imperial make a weapon to against them. Its called TSF. Tactical Surface Fighter or we can say the name for the mecha or robot. Yui Takamura and Yuuya Bridges as the MC must against the BETA who tried to take over the earth, could they did it?\\n\\n\r\nAt the first glimpse, we can merely imagine this anime would about this giant robot destroying every BETAs easily without any problem with their lasers and moreover, thinking this anime would heavily about mecha battle. Well, you can throw away that perception after watching this. in the first episode we're being served by a really dark atmosphere. Despair, hopeless and emotional moments is blended in this one. I am pretty excited about the first time when i watch this. Well, after some episode It changes. In this anime, It doesnt always about creepy and dark moments like before but also light things like comedy and more even, romance. Though the comedy and romance isnt the prominent things in this anime but its good to balanced with the heavy story on it. Moreover, the romance isnt cheesy and cheap. Moreover, its quite touching and  naturally flowing between on each characters. The comedy isnt that bad too, though sometimes it isnt really funny but at least we would get smile by watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace in this anime is rather slow than any mecha anime that i've ever seen. They have some backgrounds story for some characters and they way how they tells each of something (like BETA and or about the plan) is quite detailed and the word that they are using for explaining things is quite easy to understand. So, it isnt really hard to follow this story.\\n\\n\r\nART (10/10)\\n\r\nThis is maybe the strongest aspects on this anime, art. Muv Luv is extremely doing it well on this aspects. They way the use 3D art on the mecha is suprisingly good. I mean, look at the movements for the mecha or TSF is so smooth and moreover it doesnt crashed with the 2D background, its  feels like they are one. Not just the 3D aspects, the picture in this anime is also vivid, beautiful and sharp. Well,it doesnt so surprising since the producer is satelight which is known for making anime with vivid color like fairy tail. Though sometimes the art in this anime is changing, like when some dramatic or despair scenes comes it turns to more darker and serious tones. Honestly, the  changing between it, isnt really matter furthermore, its increasing the atmosphere feels in that scenes. Beside of  all that, The most interesing things again about the art is the character design. You will found so many interesting  character in design aspects and of course eye-candy for men since we would see so many beautiful girls with tight clothes and moreover, the art in this anime is supporting for making this \"view\" more delicious.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8/10)\\n\r\nFrom the sound section, Honestly i love the opening song in this anime \"Go to the top\" by Kumi Koda is really suitable with the this anime. Electric tunes and slow hip hop beat in this song is really catchy. The animation that appears while the song is played is also great. Its presentating every characters that would appears and of course the great 3D mecha art is still there and for the ED, its doesnt  really memorable and honestly the song is a little bit of. Moving on to character sound, the seiyuu in this anime is actually is good. For Yuuya, he is being voiced by Ono Daisuke which is known for his role on shizuo (Durarara) and for Takamura Yui, she is being voiced by Mai Nakahara which known for her role in Nagisa (clannad). Those two seiyuu is the proof for the quality of the sound characters, They are really suitable with the roles that they have. Like Yui Voice when in dere mode, Mai Nakahara can pulling that one off. though sometimes the voice is a little bit off but its still pretty enjoyable to hear their voice.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (9/10)\\n\r\nAfter the art, the most prominent things in Muv Luv is the characters. What i love from this series is the personality that each characters has. Like Yuuya, our main lead. At the first, he is a egoistical characters that only care about himself, he do what he wants to do and doesnt really care about any people, but this negative personality is changing as long as the story goes this characters turns into the one that why this characters deserve as the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nBeside Yuuya, we have Takamura Yui. which is at the first glimpse is your really annoying one. since, as the commanders and the leader for the army she is have a harsh and strict personality that makes you want to punch her right on her head but, like Yuuya as long as the story goes this personality is changing and I can safely said Yui would make the viewers fallin in love with her. especially when she is in her dere mode.\\n\\n\r\nBeside two of those, Muv Luv have another main characters, its scarlet twins. Like its name, Scarlet twins is consists of two people, Cryska and Inia. Those two people have two big differents in personality. If inia is like your imouto type which is clingy type and sweet, Cryska is more mature and strict like Yui. She is basically just do what she is ordered. The reflection between them is what makes scarlet twins is loveable and wanna makes rooting for them.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what can i say is all the characters (not just the main characters) in this anime is really enchanting and you will ended up rooting for them, One thing that particulary that Muv Lu lack is some of them  sometimes appears just for the decoration like the three girls from UN. They appears without affecting the characters nor the story, they appears Without any use. Its being wasted i think. Beside of it, like i have mention before, the characters developments in Muv Luv is really handled very well. Every thing that happen between them is affecting their personality, like Yui that gradually have an interest with Yuuya. Anyway, We dont just see the battles but also the drama within it and what makes them changed especially in the personality like Yuuya or Yui does.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (9/10)\\n\r\nin the end, i must say i satisfied with what i have watched. spending nearly for 8 hours just for watching this series is really pays off. I even didnt realize that i had in the last episode. The art, story and the characters is the one why i can sitting down quietly watching this anime. Honestly, Mecha isnt my things. But this one is different, i felt this one is totally different from what i expect from mecha anime. The harem and romance aspects is probably the one that surprise me a lot from this series. Well, who knows that harem+mecha is turn out into a great combination? Anyway, i really recommend this anime if you seek for pleasure and great anime.\\n\\n\r\n*Feedbacks are needed, thanks!*\\n",

This review is only after seeing the first 2 episodes so my opinion may change down the road but i like what i see so far. I am not a fan of mecha .. at all. I from time to time will give it a chance to see how the story develops.  This story has the normal details of alien invasion and people flying around killing they enemy and how the world is at war. Yes im fully aware this plot hasbeen used and abused over and over. However this one is different. It gives you a further detail back story to certain characters and how friendship builds and watching your own friends die. It is extremely graphic when it comes to blood and violent death. The 2nd episode was spectacular. There were moments it make my skin crawl and i love horror anime so im use to it but the details of the story and build up is what makes it fantastic. I do not want to throw in any spoilers but i highly recommend you give this series a shot even if you dont like mecha because it may surprise you.",

            "content": "Aliens, known as the B.E.T.A, invade our planet in the year 1973. They mindlessly attack humans and devour us like food. There is no way to communicate with these B.E.T.A , so our only option left is to fight them. To do so, we humans invent giant humanoid machines called Tactical Surface Fighters (or TSFs). Pilots are trained to man these machines and fight in the front lines against the B.E.T.A forces; however, this is not a story about those who fight in the front lines. This is a side story about the test pilots who make sure the TSFs are suitable for use onthe front lines.\\n\\n\r\nA side story...most people lower their expectations when they hear this. Side stories are usually not as good because they are simply a tool used to promote the main series. This is pretty much the case for Muv-luv Alternative: Total Eclipse. It is a spin-off of the original Light Novel series, Muv-Luv Alternative. With that in mind, i walked into this anime with lowered expectations. I advise you all to do the same.\\n\\n\r\nIt all started out fine. The B.E.T.A invades Japan, and our heroine Takamura Yui fights them off with her friends. They are in turn horribly massacred by the B.E.T.A, and Yui is forced to watch as her friends get eaten alive right before her eyes. A dark and bloody atmosphere is built by the third episode... but then that atmosphere gets destroyed almost instantly. It becomes extremely obvious a few episodes later that the first two episodes were a trap.\\n\\n\r\nTotal Eclipse switches from that dark and brooding atmosphere to a beach episode in just a few episodes. It almost becomes a sort of romance/slice of life anime later on. The story then starts to become more and more inconsistent. They go from people getting eaten alive in Japan to a military base in Alaska. From there they go to a beach resort and then another military base in Russia.They eventually even end up in a hot spring somewhere and somehow. By the time we get to the halfway point of the series, almost no traces of the feeling gotten from the first two episodes remained. The inconsistency of the setting makes the plot a jumbled mess, and it becomes increasingly difficult to understand where it is going. \\n\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings towards the characters in Total Eclipse. I don't hate them, but i do not exactly like them either. Our main hero,Yuyaa Bridges is pretty much your average day superman. Nothing can get pass his thick, thick Plot Armor. He gets surrounded by hundreds of B.E.T.A? He cuts them down and leaves with a nearly broken machine. He gets surrounded by a group of other TSFs? Gets off without a scratch. It becomes harder and harder to believe that this man can get so lucky.\\n\\n\r\nYou would think that his luck would run out near the end, but it does not. Somehow, out of nowhere, this guy manages to create a Harem during the last few episodes. There is almost no prior development with any members of his harem except Yui. They all flock to him for simple generic reasons like, \"he is a nice guy\", or \"he is super talented\". It looked like the writers just wanted to mix in as many genres as they possibly could. The romance looked really force and it in turn made most of the characters look very shallow. That is not to say i hated the cast of characters. I personally found them amusing to watch despite being very generic and boring at times. By generic i mean they all fitted specific stereotypes. Yuuya was the all powerful main character. Yui was your text book example of a tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Total Eclipse can be very deceiving. A majority of the scenes would be drawn and animated very well. This puts up the appearance that the series' artwork is actually well done; however, there would always be a handful of scenes where the animators got extremely lazy. In these scenes, the characters would look like weird blobs with a face and clothes. Said scenes were done very poorly and degrades the overall quality of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nI have always been very lenient on mech animations. I like them all no matter what, and Total Eclipse was no exception. The TSFs artwork and animation were impressive, but there was one problem. All of the TSFs looked the same. The only difference was a variety in colors. Everything else about them were so similar that it was hard for me to tell which was which. A team of TSFs would all look exactly the same, so telling them apart was nearly impossible.\\n\\n\r\nMusic was the best aspect of this series for me. I loved every track from the first opening and ending to the second opening and closing song. The first opening \"Go to the top\" took a unique and different approach. It was a nice and catchy rock song that went surprisingly well with this anime. The second opening, \"Doubt the World\" gave me shivers with its epic final battle sort of feel. It was an appropriate song for the last few episodes. The ending theme, \"Revise the world\", has probably become one of my favorite ending songs. It had such a sad and intense feel to it. A wonderful song for an epic climax and conclusion to a story. Now if only the ending to Total Eclipse was not so anti-climatic ...\\n\\n\r\nIt might seem like i really hated this series, but i actually quite enjoyed it. A sort of guilty pleasure was what it was. Total Eclipse was obviously something along the lines of sub par, but i found it enjoyable all the same. After all, nothing beats aliens, giant mechs, and hot girls in tight suits.",

Characters are developed well; fear and gore appropriately conveyed. The progress (training, war) is realistic too.\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nThe art style feels old, like pre-2006 era of anime. Graphics are not sharp, though blood and dismembered body parts are shown clearly.\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nI like how the music came in at turning points, where the MC is saved. Also, the bgm create a scary ambience. Not tomention the screams -- those are portrayed well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed both episodes so far; there isn't a moment of dullness. I'd recommend Muv-Luv to anyone looking for a good wartime anime, or simply a mecha one.",

So this is one of studio Satelight's  anime for the last part of 2012 eh? So this 24 episode anime is something which was combined with \"Starship Troopers\" with the usual Jap mech, for me the plot was good, but I really don't like this anime's setting where the BETA onslaught begun in 1973 and it continue 'til 2001?????? I guess the first director, TakayukiInagaki seems to be shitting us audience. Also, I kinda hate the scenario where the cold war seems to be on, except here the coldwar  is a 4 way stand-off between the USA, Imperial Japan, China and USSR instead of the realistic 2 way. Though their animosity among the superpowers may have been put on hold due to the BETA onslaught, there is still that distrust the exist between them, and as much as I hate to say it this anime is more focus on man's distrust with one another rather than the invader, it was very obvious as the BETA's here are more like  a calamity than an enemy and the battle of the TSF against the BETA's are more of a side show than anything else. The romance and the harem element did provide a good mood as this anime's filler, but it was rather disappointing that the man's battle with the BETA's ended in a cliffhanger and so as the Yuuya's harem, instead it ended with man fighting against man , if one ask me who would I like Yuuya to be his love interest my choice is split between Cryska and Yui. About the TSF, well unlike other anime's with a mech genre, this one at least in this anime's illustrator's point of view was a bit lame, e.g. why can't those TSF take off vertically? Why don't they have any energy weapons? Why is it that they don't use medium thermonuclear rounds against those bigger BETA's? Also, though the TSF design differs from country to country, the differences are too minimal that one can't tell which is which, seems like the illustrator was more focus on the TSF's art than the mechanical aspect and the same goes for the flight suit that those so called Eishi used ( Why couldn't they just be called pilots?) in which it was design as a body hugging outfit that makes them eishi's look like that they were wearing nothing, then gain it does look good on the girls especially those with big boobs. The character are pretty much way predictable at least from episode 3 up to the end, which is safe to say that episode 1 and 2 was all on Yui, Yuuya character's is quite unique since he was portrayed as an underdog first by Yui then by the soviets and in the last episode he's now the big shot, for the most part Cryska and Inia are more like romantic teasers for Yuuya. To be honest, I can't say much about this anime since part of me says that it's overrated and one part of me tells me that it's good, but I guess it's up one's self as how he finds all the \"U-turns\" that comes with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMy rating for each category:\\n\\n\r\nSound, character, enjoyment and overall: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThis is because there are episodes that I find enjoyable, and there are episodes the where underrated.\\n\\n\r\nStory and art: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nthought the execution were a bit off the story and the plot are still good, and as for the art the 7 rating is for female character's fanservice and the way they wore their flight suit. \\n\\n",

            "content": "The first two episodes of this anime grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me around a little. It was pretty brutal, emotional and intense. It created a very dark tone, which I was pretty excited about but then I got to the third episode and everything changed. Did it change for the worst? Well that's debatable.\r\nThe first couple of eps set the scene. It's end of the world humanity is on the edge of extinction and everyone is dying. Afterwords though every episode just seems to neglect the horrid reality of the world the characters live in. Also the tone I first spoke ofis gone. Muv-luv actually seems to have trouble trying to decide what its going for. One episode it's a fight to the death with every character in danger the next its a harem party at a hot spring!? If you can get passed the inconsistencies with the story then you, like me, will enjoy muv-luv.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the reasons would be the characters. I ended up rooting for everyone and couldn't really pick a favorite. Character development is handled very well. We get enough insight into the main characters lives to really feel for them and the supporting characters are just as good even without going into the same depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was outstanding even in every episode. I loved the Mecha and character designs and the actions scenes(WHICH ARE AWESOME) are animated beautifully everything feels so smooth and is just a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the up and down story I really enjoyed Muv-Luv it was emotionally engaging at times then even hilariously funny. The mecha battles are exciting and when the story does start to lead somewhere it does actually get quite intense. It's not the best Mecha anime I've every seen but it is certainly better than a lot of others in it's field. A solid 7 a good anime and one that deserves a watch if you have the time!",

            "content": "Here is a short and sweet version.\r\nSince 1973, an alien called the BETA has been invading earth. Things to know about the BETA: we know almost nothing, There are several categories, and the first three minutes a pilot spends on the battlefield against them are known as the Three Minutes of Death, because it is rare for anyone to survive longer than that, even with giant robots. This story is not about the overall defeat of the BETA, but more like a major point amidst the chaos of the war. The setting is Alaska at a testing facility for the TFS robots and weapons. Thereare several layers of characters in this anime, such as nation, the facility, the testing groups, the characters themselves, and other entities like Refugees groups and the military. Each character/entity/group is individualized and can be viewed as a person all on his/her/its own which is very amazing feat. The main character is Yuuya Bridges. The story is mostly about him coming to terms with the Japanese part of hi Japanese-American heritage. The story does this by personifying his Japanese heritage with his Japanese test robot. Through several story arcs of different types, he slowly begins to understand how his robot works and come to grip with his heritage. To help him is his own group, and Yui Takamura, his Japanese Commanding officer with a tragic past. That is the main gist of the story. \\n\r\nHere is the detailed version.\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nWhat? An 7? Yes, an 7. The story really isn't all that original. It is your generic \"Aliens are invading, only part of the world is still inhabitable and so all of us Nations are sharing it.\" (kind of like Strike Witches, no offense to Strike Witches). But if it's so generic, why did I give it an 7? Because it is still very different. Normally, an anime like this would focus on a hero of some sort with a special machine and abilities who can kill everything, but this anime takes a different approach. Bridges is definitely an Ace pilot, just like all of the other test pilots, but he hates being a test pilot, he would rather be on the field fighting. So why pull top ranks from the field to test robots?  Because a skilled pilot is needed to test robots that could have all sorts of bugs in them. Part of this story is in fact about Bridges coming to grips with the handling and control of his Japanese style robot. Bridges himself is Japanese-American, but he despises Japan because he believes them to be cowards, and he thinks his robots fighting style is built in all wrong. His fight with learning to pilot the robot is parallel to him coming to grips with his Japanese heritage. Though the BETA are a major part in this story, they aren't the main focus. The focus is rather Bridges and his groups own personal struggle against each other and other nations. (I will talk more about this in the character section.) As well as the nations of earth fighting against each other while fighting the BETA. What do I mean? While they all want to defeat the BETA, each nation wants to cripple the other ones, that way when the BETA are defeated, then one nation will be able to stand above them all. This story also brings into view the relations of the characters as people, and as citizens of other countries, but more on that in the character section. The story is great and contains multiple smaller conflicts within overall major conflicts. It is entertaining and somewhat tragic at the same time. Also, don't be thrown off by the first few episodes. The story begins by following Yui Takamura as a High school student and it shows what happens to her platoon. While this part is horrific and scarring, it serves as an important basis for Yui's character later on and is crucial. MOVING ON!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nI love the art in this anime. The characters are drawn and animated beautifully, but more than that, i love the animation of the fights. Because we are dealing with robots, the robots are 3D and so are the BETA. this makes the fight scenes much more dramatic and capturing. Artists do a good job capturing the emotions of the characters in their faces as well as in the scripts. The BETA have very unique designs and traits that are nearly impossible to copy without blantantly ripping them off, and are very wonderfully animated. Explosions are not over done, and the blood sprays are almost beautiful, except that they are blood. NEXT!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI love the OP theme for this anime. It catches the intense action and sudden changes of this anime. It shows character motivation and it\u2019s got a good beat. The lip syncing is good, and the sound effects are also great. The cries from the BETA are easily distinguishable as cries of pain or aggression. The voice actors\u2019 portrayal of emotion in their voices is also superb. The machines whir, and the monsters scream. Swords buzz with energy and guns shout with bullets. It kept me on the edge of my seat. \\n\r\nCharacter ( my favorite\uf04a): 10\\n\r\nThis story has multiple characters, and each character exists on a different level. This is best seen in Cryska: she is Russian and is thus ultimately loyal to the Motherland. In her test group, which is her and her little sister Inia, she will do anything to help Inia and hurt anyone who gets near her including \u201cthe Motherland\u201d.  Then she exists as herself, something she has trouble doing after being raised in communist Russia. She doesn\u2019t understand her own emotions, and doesn\u2019t overall know what she wants.  If you look at Yuuya Bridges, He is loyal to America, despises Japan and Yui (cuz she is Japanese and for no other reason). He exists as the \u201cleader\u201d of his team. And as an individual does what he thinks is best on the whole, disregarding everyones\u2019 orders. There are also lots of entities in this anime. Entities fall into three or for basic categories: Russia, America, Japan, and the BETA. Russia and Japan are the big ones, and this is highlighted by the relationship between Cryska and Yuuya. America is more of just \u201cyeah we survived you guys all owe us.\u201d And the BETA are used as a rallying point to say, \u201cWe are all on the same side.\u201d They aren\u2019t actually that lame, though. \\n\r\nThis anime also does an amazing job with the side characters. Everyone from the waitress at the bar to the mechanic in the hangar manages to form a connection with you. They are round even though they barely get screen time. While there is a set group of characters, this anime does a fantastic job of integrating new people, and disposing of other ones.  Personally, I believe that the ability to connect with the characters really builds into an anime and helps direct the flow. You know what a character will do based on their mindset, and this anime does a great job of leaving you guessing without making you cringe. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI often had to take breaks while watching this anime, and I hated every moment of it. This anime always has a sense of suspense in it and in multiple ways. There is a suspense between the characters, between the BETA and the humans, and between the entities, all of which is tied together in one form or another. It left me wondering \u201cwhat happens next?\u201d without some lame dramatic reveal at the end like: \u201cwe just found her dead\u201d \u2013roll credits-. While it does have some of those cheesy romantic suspense moments like \u201cWhat do I feel for him\u201d and \u201cWhat is love?\u201d it still kept my attention and made up for it with battle scenes, in which anything that could possibly go wrong probably did. As a result, I think a 9 is pretty fair. \\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nWhy? Read the above and then watch the anime. You won\u2019t regret it. \\n",

            "content": "Prelude\r\nMuv-Luv is a franchise well known amongst westerners as \u201cthe best\u201d visual novel ever made, and has a surprisingly big fan base. But most don\u2019t know that the Visual Novel franchise is actually based on a Light Novel series, which no one has probably read outside of those who read Chinese translated books or Japanese\u2026The reason why everyone liked the whole game was because it takes itself seriously and the characters have actual motifs for their actions, not feeling like dolls that can be played around with.\r\nAnd thus, it became what it is today, but I\u2019m not here reviewing the Visual Novel, but theanimated adaption of the side Light Novel.\\n\\n\r\nReview Part: Intro Presentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTotal Eclipse is set in the year 2001 where humanity is on the verge of extinction due to encountering an unkown species, which later are named to The Beings of Extra Terrestrial origin which is Adversary of human race or shortly put (BETA).\\n\r\nThe first character to die halfway in the first episode with the phrase \u201ceh?\u201d which she states after a character blatantly warns her 5 seconds earlier that she should watch out. \\n\r\nAnd you\u2019re support to be like \u201cOH NO! WHY?!\u201d or the scene where her friend tells her \u201cShoot me!\u201d but she misses every single shot with her dying in vain, crying like a baby, which afterwards she gets saved by plot convenience to extend her role in the story, pretty bold if you ask me. \\n\\n\r\nReview Part: Characters\\n\r\nThe characters in Total Eclipse are a mix of all types of anime\\n\r\nstereotypes sexualized to the point of no return. Of course, there are a few exceptions. But the main dish just feels uneasy on the eyes or distracting to focus on the story or character motives, because you\u2019ll be staring at their huge melons or the weird spandex suit. The characters themselves are barely memorable as well. We have the MC being that arrogant pro who can\u2019t do anything because he hasn\u2019t mastered the ways of Japanese Tactical Surface Fighter, as different countries build them based on different uses. Americans brute force, Russians Maneuverability and power, Japanese mostly Maneuverability so it can jump around like Mario.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast are there to help him change his view on how he should use them. As they pretty much can\u2019t afford to lose trust between themselves. Seriously, the characters were so forgettable except one or two that I\u2019ll end up missing them entirely. VG is a notable character who cracks/does perverse jokes but has an attitude which actually hits the soft spot.\\n\\n\r\n Especially his Dub actor, he did an outstanding job to portray him. Bridges is your Eren Jaeger who has no personality or reason at all except being there causing drama or dumb plot-twists that will make you raise a brow or scratch your head. Takamura is the main female lead that is a literal tsundere, nothing much to note on her, throughout the course of the story she doesn\u2019t change. And no, her relationship with the Bridges doesn\u2019t go anywhere. Cryska and her sister are pretty much the equivalent of little sister loves MC, elder one doesn\u2019t but eventually falls in love. Yes folks, it\u2019s a love quadrangle. She\u2019s an emotionless killer who turns into a yandere because plot called it. There are of course. Much more characters, but I hardly remember what they wanted to do or their motives in the show, which leaves a very poor example of the show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nReview Part: Storytelling & Arcs\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story telling is led by a predictable outcomes and unconving reactions to be taken seriously. It constantly changes to unrelated topics about the show and its characters. First it\u2019s a training drama about surviving the beta attack and helping humanity in further developing TSFs to improve their chance of survival then all of a sudden we go to a Beach arc about how the MC is treated as shit because he\u2019s Half-Japanese I mean seriously? Oh and it gets better. Another few training sessions come in, but focus mostly their back stories which is good, but when the story does nothing so you can remember these characters you just don't want to care either way. The pacing changes from fast to slow at random, throughout the first 5 episodes where they build on relationships with characters and their motives they change to drama about going to the girls hot spring then all of a sudden into a the-military-does-not-respect-us-civilians drama. The whole testing pilot thing literally stays true for only \u00bc of the series and no more. Presenting multiple plot holes and nonsensical reasonings which of course mean nothing in the long run, because it ends up being a shonen-style storytelling where the power of believing will make the day bright again. Technically after the arcs could\u2019ve been made way better by expanding on the series for more than 26 episodes and actually do something with its themes and characters and not end up in just another forgettable cash-in.\\n\\n\\n\r\nReview Part: Production values and music\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\\n\r\nOh boy, here is the thing where it made me want the show to have been done by Sunrise and not Satelight. For a war drama that focuses mostly on robot fighting, the robot themselves are Computer-Generated meaning that half of the animation just dies, which not to say that it had any spectacular animation to begin with. So the drop in quality is quite high regardless of what you\u2019rewatching\u2026The PowerPoint presentation walking or running animation is distracting, so to save budget they mostly sit around doing nothing and talk for an eternity, even the enemies are CG it really fell flat here, there was nothing redeemable about it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Designs \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are one note and pretty basic, you have short hair mid length hair short hair differences. One note backgrounds, and semi-post apocalyptic landscape here and there. Nothing special really, they didn\u2019t even try improving the already existing designs or backgrounds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic and usage\\n\\n\r\nThe music is mostly forgettable, but fits the scenario pretty well. Considering most of the times nothing specific happens, and the overall action scenes are little. There was one insert song by Granrodeo which was a good insert song that played twice. And one at the end of ep 4, the rest is either reenacted from the VN ost mixed with anime original, and it\u2019s pretty poorly used. The 4 action scenes that actually played those 2 insert songs was nice to listen to while the fight was going in the background but in the end, it fell off the rope and went straight down the lake.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\r\nIn conclusion it\u2019s a below average production that really has nothing for you to bother wasting your time with, I have a dim recollection of the characters exactly 7 days after I finished it. Of course, it may only be worth it if you want to break it down.",

I love anime this, with a great story line, & different characters that mesh together as one.

            "content": "There is one and only one way that could have saved this series from being more than just eye candy without any thought behind it:\r\nDo not try to take a dating sim concept, and turn it into a legitimate anime by throwing in mindless racist attacks against America.\r\nThe first two episodes were good just for getting the concept behind the enemy, and the horrors of war straight. However, who in their right mind, when the species is on the line, sends a bunch of teenage girls who represent the best, brightest descendants of the Imperial heritage of Japan, out to the front lines? That iscalled STUPID! There is a reason in most American sci-fi that the best and brightest are usually saved in reserve or their talents are used to help in other areas: you want those particularly smart people to make babies for the next generation to be the best and brightest, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, nowhere in this anime is there any tactics or strategy that make any kind of sense, or offer the species any chance of survivability. The \"circling and descending\" attacks Yui brags about that the underpowered, gutless 94 Second is designed to do are the same tactical maneuvers Japanese Zero pilots used to effectively die in the gunsights of American Wildcat, Hellcat, and Corsair aviators.\\n\\n\r\nFor serious discussions on proper ACM tactics, please refer to Colonel John Boyd's \"Aerial Attack Study\", Energy-Maneuverability Theory, and the OODA Loop.\\n\\n\r\nThird: Who in their right mind builds a bunch of mecha to fight an overwhelming swarm of bugs (that of course have to have eyes, hands, heads, and mouths, even though they share no genetic similarities whatsoever to Earth lifeforms), when a simple EM cannon carried by one mecha can decimate an entire force of the enemy? Why not build a couple strategic bomber aircraft to sweep the Earth with these weapons at altitude, and avoid the messy business of killing humans unnecessarily? Oh right... because we can't have a plot driven off of anything except hand to hand combat with monsters!\\n\\n\r\nFourth: Ever since \"Blood+\" made that horrible effigy of Condoleeza Rice bragging about how Americans all want to conquer the world, I've been slowly turning off anime. This series is the straw that has broken the camel's back. Since WWII, America has profusely apologized to a nation it had to strike with two nuclear devices because the Imperial military was so hell-bent on fighting to the last man, over a quarter of the Earth's population would have been lost by the end of the war. Nevermind a pacifist movement in Japan's own citizens were cheering for America's resolution to drop the bomb, but even after over 60 years of rebuilding and peacetime, the Japanese still do not understand why they lost the war, and blame the \"blue eyed devils\" for all their problems.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, Muv-Luv is an exercise to duplicate the fanbase of Hetalia by stereotyping certain cultures in the series, and somehow trying to rewrite history to show Japan as an Imperialist nation would be feasible in the modern world.\\n\\n\r\nAll that's missing is Yui saying \"and I would have gotten away with it, if it weren't for you meddling kids, and your dog!\"",

Well I turned out to be a bit wrong about this one. While the first 2 episodes of the series were what I was looking for things then took a hard left turn. The episodes after number 2 have been on the development of another main character and pushing the main of the first 2 episodes to the side somewhat. It also has taken away the dark aspect and made it more of a lighter hey look at me andsee what I am learning how to do. While I still like the mecha aspect of this anime the story development has left me confused and wondering if I wish to continue this anime. Well we shall see!\\n",

            "content": "----------NO SPOILERS PAST EPISODE 1-----------\r\nSet in the past. Better technology then we have now? How could anything so ridiculous sounding be great? Well read this if your just looking for a good anime to watch, or if you want to know the answer to my question. This is a review of the Fall 2012 anime: Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse. Enjoy \r\nStory: 10\r\nMuv-Luv Alternative : Total Eclipse was a very unique anime. It is set in a past that has scientifically passed our current age technology. They have mecha-bots called TSF's which they use to fight the BETA. An alien species that is just bent ondestroying the earth and wiping out the Humans. When I read the mecha tag I thought here we go again, another mecha anime, but surprisingly this one turned out to be extremely different. Yuuya Bridges is a Half American Half Japanese ensign, a TSF pilot. Being one of the top American TSF pilots he is sent to Alaska to work on a joint American Japanese TSF research project. There he meets the Japanese lady named Yui Takamura, who teaches Yuuya many things. About him and fighting the BETA.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe character art was amazing, but whenever the BETA came around they looked way too realistic. They looked amazing, but when ever people where getting hurt the graphics looked to realistic. When the bullets hit the flesh the blood coming out was to realistic. They were the only fully 3d object in the 2d world of Total Eclipse. Out of place but amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThis anime is like most anime, I can only remeber 2 OST's from this anime. The only reason I gave this a 7 was for the first opening \"Go To The Top\"  In my opinion the this was a really great opening. Other then that was the OST playing in the last episode while he was being a bada**.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe character development was simply put amazing. Each main character has their own specific background story that somewhat ties into the anime and how its told. Sometimes it may seem like its somewhat confusing, but sooner than later it will make complete sense. The main character is a great one and I hope you'll come to like him just like I did (not in a yaoi way lol).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement 9\\n\r\nSundays at 7, thats when it came out subbed on the sight that I watched it on. Every Sunday I would make sure I had time to see Total Eclipse. I followed it everyday and the only episode I watched late was the 20th, which was a recap episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 \\n\r\nFrom a non biased point of view this anime deserves an 8 when I take into consideration all of the points that make up this anime. All in all this was a great anime, that most people need to watch one time or another. Also, A warning, this anime is addicting. :)\\n\\n\r\n-StellerScale",

            "content": "To Start off If you havent read the Muv Luv Visual Novel you for the most part wont understand this world of Muv luv. To make it as short as possible, this is an alternate universe where historical events played out differently and humans put their backs out during the space age. Leading to humans first encountering the BETA, on Mars, then going to war against them on the Moon, until finally they landed on Earth back in 73'(at the height of the Cold War). This anime starts in 1998, by this time the BETA have already taken(which means they have eaten eveyone and everythingin their path) the whole continent of Eurasia(and the Soviets retreated to Alaska)\\n\\n\r\n____________Visual novel Spoilers (this info isnt in the anime) __________\\n\\n\r\nBETA:\\n\r\nAre biological machines sent out to planets to collect resources for their silicone based lifeform creators.\\n\\n\r\nThe BETA also recycle everything they eat including dead BETA (so they eat their dead, our dead, The plants, animals, even the dirt, and rocks, and they make more BETA.)\\n\\n\r\nThe BETA consume everythin and in the terriortories that the BETA overrun the land is stripped bare to the point where once there was a forest all thats left is sterile dirt.\\n\\n\r\nIf your wondering why they dont just nuke the BETA its because beyond the blast and heat Nukes have no effect on BETA(probably because they can operate just fine even in outter space)\\n\\n\r\nIf your wondering why they dont just shoot missiles or use air support. Its because a BETA type known as the Laser Class which are able to fire lasers with pen point accuracy and can/will shoot down anything(Birds, planes, missiles) in the thats going slower then speed of light from a extreme distance\\n\\n\r\nIf your wondering why the humans are losing the BETA war. \\n\\n\r\n1. BETA have eaten more then Half the Human Population(to the point where even 12 year olds are drafted into the military)\\n\r\n2. BETA with their laser class Control the skies\\n\r\n3. In the Alternte universe humans have waged even more wars on eachother even after the BETA landing on earth\\n\r\n4. The US is making TSF's that are made to fight other TSFs (dumbasses)\\n\r\n5. The BETA Keep coming in greater and greater numbers\\n\r\n6. The average survival time for a new TSF pilot is 8 minutes\\n\r\n7. It takes BETA only Months to replace their losses\\n\r\n8. The BETA vanguard units(Destroyer Class) are over 20 meters tall and have Armor thats Mohs hardness 15(which is 5 levels above diamond) and run at 170 kph\\n\r\n9. The Height of the BETA is between 2.3 meters to over 100 meters (most of the time they are fighting the ones that are 15+ meters tall and are bigger then a 2 story house (though the Tank class is the size of a tank it has the strength to rip off a turret of a tank and eat the goodies inside...))\\n\\n\r\nFun fact Most TSF use Names from actual Military aircraft (It is an alternate universe after all) the very first TSF was the F-4 Phantom\\n\\n\r\nG-material is mentioned at the end of the series but no explanation is given.\\n\\n\r\nG-Material is what the BETA process gathered material into and is used as a power source\\n\r\nG-Material was collected by humans when the second BETA landing pod touched down in Cananada and the US nuked the hell out of them before they could start creating laser class in any number. All that was left was the BETA G-material and most of Cananda bacame radio-active.(which is far better then letting the BETA live)\\n\\n\r\nHumans use G-Material to create G-bombs(basically Blackhole bombs), which are insanely effective against the BETA however their side effect are just as bad as letting the BETA live or worse(nuke radiation is like nothing compared to it)\\n\r\nAfter effects include:\\n\r\n- Steriliazation of the land\\n\r\n- Complete loss of everything within the blast radius\\n\r\n- Creating Tidal waves Miles high\\n\r\n- Sinking land/raising land from the ocean\\n\r\n- Completely blocks almost any kind of signal\\n\r\n- Gravity anomalies\\n\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly being nuked is far far far far better then being G-bombed\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nThis story takes place during the BETA assualt on Japan the first 2 episodes are dark and gloomy, however after that the anime becomes far more light hearted. The real story takes place in Yukon 2 years later, where TSF(giant robots) manufactures(Argos Test Flight is a Japanese development team, which this story is focused on) are testing and improving weapons to fight the beta. Argos Test Flight is thrown into different situations on purpose or not trying to make the Japanese TSF the Shiranui 2nd into the best TSF it can possibly be for fighting the BETA. If you wanted more of what the first 2 episode are like watch the spin off Schwarzesmarken.\\n\\n\r\nThe 3D models of the TSFs stand out alot in some scene and the work really well in others, The Art style is typical early 2010's. (theres also a very high amount of blood, mainly BETA blood)\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds of the TSFs fairly average and surprisingly unlike most animes with giant monster that eat people the BETA for all intensive purposes do not make vocial sounds period. The opening theme is also extremely fitting for the tone of the first 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a very mixed bag.\\n\\n\r\nYui Takamura - we see her in her first battle then see becomes a hard ass at the end of episode 2. However the instant she meets Yuuya Bridges she goes from Bitch to Bitch in heat in less time then it took the BETA to eat her friend in episode 2.\\n\\n\r\nYuuya Bridges - hes a very different character from most animes MC's. This one a a Racists who hates the japanese even though hes half japanese. At first he utterly Hates Yui but then his character shifts just as fast as Yui's, Though he still hates being called japanese.(hes also a really good TSF pilot( or so they say...))\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the Scarlett sisters. They are just two Soviet girls who were raised together and one of them is an Esper. (and what do ya know they also fall for Yuuya)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - This anime can be intense one moment and totally light hearted the next. This anime has a decent anmout of fan service, and a decent amount of gore and a LOT of blood(Mainly BETA blood)\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you want to see some fanservice while also fearing that your fav character might get eaten this is the anime for you.",

The dramatic action-packed opening quickly loses momentum and eventually enters love-comedy-harem territory.

Finally it picks right back up again for the last few episodes to give some form of an ending that leaves you scratching your head.\r\nThe mech action is OK but not altogether memorable. The Beta do not leave you with a sense of dread that they should.

            "content": "When somebody says the word \"mecha\", we would immediately think action and robot vs robot flying and fighting each other. Yes, muv-luv did have these elements, but it also included the mindset of the characters in it.\r\nI'll get straight to the point, Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse was a great anime that was overlooked by a lot of people. \r\nI'll first mention why I really loved this anime.\r\nStoryline:\r\nI feel like the storyline for Muvluv is very original especially since we get to see and experience what is happening in the backlines during an all-out war.\r\nIt starts off  by giving us a feeling of despair anddarkness because even the most advanced mechas get taken down by the B.E.T.A.. However, after the first two episodes it shifts the point-of-view of the anime towards the events happening in the back lines of the fight. Because of this view, we are given front row seats to see the character relationships and experience the character development more in depth. Although the action is lacking compared to some other mecha anime, MuvLuv makes up for it by showing us the mindset of the people and why they do what they do. But nevertheless, the action scenes were still gorgeous. The story not only tackles issues that are personal, it also ponders national and even global themes. I really love how accurate they show human reaction especially during the brink of despair. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters were very dynamic in a sense that even the interactions were very entertaining. Also, the character development was very interesting to watch, especially for our three \"main\" characters. Yuuya Bridges, Yui Takamura, and Cryska Barchenowa. First about Yuuya, he starts off as a cocky young pilot who thinks he is the best in the world, but then after experiencing near death situations with his comrades, he began to develop not only a sense of humility but also a sense of caring and responsibility. Yui Takamura, a member of the japanese guard on the other hand started off acting like a stuck-up woman to her comrades especially Yuuya. She always was pushing others away and testing them because it was her job. But as the series goes on she eventually removes herself from isolation and accepts the help of others and even make others her role model.\\n\r\nCryska, a member of the soviet flight, started out as a really cold persona, all she cared about was doing the job that was set-out for her and taking care of her \"sister\" Inia. Though, through interactions with the other characters in the story she gradually changes ad in the end found something very worthwhile for her to protect. However, thats not all, the side characters were also very interesting. They were not only there to serve as side characters, a lot of them became catalysts so that the main characters can act on something of have more development. Another addition is that all of the actions of the characters have a drive for it, not just done without just reason.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: The art used in this anime is really beautiful considering the budget allotted for it. The character designs were very detailed and the mechas looked awesome, even the aliens looked crisp and colorful. As for the sound, the first opening, \"Go to the Top\" was very catchy and was destined for this series.\\n\\n\r\nSlight Nuances(spoilers):\\n\r\nThe love triangle that is Yui, Yuuya, and Cryska felt a litle forced at times but was never an actual hindrance to the story. If they wanted to highlight this relationship, they should have done so otherwise utting it to the side might not be a bad idea. They also could have improved the fight scene music to give it a more \"epic\" feeling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: MuvLuv contains enjoyment that is not found in the surface level. You have to look at the intricacies of the characters and the story itself. Ultimately this was still a very good show that gives us a new view of things both personally and beyond.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy mecha anime that involves much mindset and character development this show is a definite much watch.",

            "content": "There's been a lot of strange series that debuted in 2012. If there was another to name, one would definitely be Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse. No, it's not the end of the year (yet) for us but in the world of the Total Eclipse, it's walking down that path. The series is based off a LN (light novel) of the same name and takes place in a science fiction world where mecha, aliens, and hot women with suits of iron dominating the series. It's definitely not everyday that you get to see chicks fighting otherworldly beings and still getting the time to relax. Let's lookand see for ourselves what Muv Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse has to offer:\\n\\n\r\nThe series is set in an alternative timeline where our planet Earth has been invaded by aliens forces known as the BETA. This sort of genre can be traced into many science fiction series such as Strike Witches, Gunparade March, and even Neon Genesis. The BETA has caused the Earth resistance to develop jet/mecha hybrid called Tactical Surface Fighters or TSF to eradicate them. Mankind now is in a state of war, horror, and survival where the skies rains with blood and the ground leaves the scars of battles. Muv Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse focuses on the exploration of these battles, characters' interactions, and the survival of mankind. \\n\\n\r\nThe first episode isn't what we might expect. When I watched it, there's seems to be a sort of \u201cmindfuck\u201d reaction. In fact, it's not what most of us expected but a rather dark flashback with Yui in her final days of high school. To be honest, high school is never too fun for most people but in Yui's case has gotten that much grimmer. In a tragic twist, she is forced into immediate combat with her classmates for the first time against the powerful BETA. And with that, blood is spilled with a brutality of violence is presented to the viewers. If you thought this was a show about hot girls doing hot things, then think again. \\n\\n\r\nFrom there though, everything shifts to present time and we get to see the other characters of the series. It seems Yui has become that much more confident and with her status now as lieutenant. Starring opposite her though is the ever stubborn, short-tempered, confident Yuuya Bridges. He is of the Japanese American descent who follows his roles a strong soldier against the forces of the BETA. His short temper and characteristics forms a barrier between most of the other characters in the beginning with him presenting an attitude of \u201cdon't fuck with me\u201d personality. \\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of personalities, this series mixes in different characters with different characteristics. Let's take for example:\\n\\n\r\nThe Scarlet Twins - \\n\r\nCryska \"Scarlet Twin\" Barchenowa who is of the Soviet descent has a cold personality and is afraid to let people get close to her because the state of her mentality. She is the cold beauty of the series with an equally cold ability to fly the unfriendly skies of the series and doing what she does best. On the other hand, we got Inia \"Scarlet Twin\" Sestina. She is Cryska's most precious individual (and \u201csister\u201d) in that twisted world . Unlike Cryska though, Inia is much more gentler and treats other people with kindness especially Yuuya who she adores like an older brother. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in the series has different personalities as well. Tarisa Manandal, whom Yuuya teasingly calls her Chobi acts as the more comedic side of the series despite some of the more serious violence tone going on around. Later on, we also meet Cui Yifei, a pilot of the Chinese descent that brings out the inner tsundere from Yui. \\n\\n\r\nThese lovely ladies all have their different personalities but the show occasionally tries to hard. For example, some of the filler episodes involving the beach and the onsen presents us nothing more than just pure fan-service that's irrelevant to the story. Furthermore, the women of the series are drawn in a way that reflects their figures directly to the viewers with those tight suits. Who can forget those suits honestly? I bet most people here watched the trailer and added it to their PTW just from that. \\n\\n\r\nThere is more than just beyond the fan-service though for this rather underrated series. As more episodes progressed, we can see a more political side of Total Eclipse involving the various genetic heritages of the main characters. The nickname \u201cJapanese Doll\u201d given by Yuuya Bridges to Yui serves as a comedic but also political reference to his personality towards the race. The other characters' heritages also strikes a distinguishing background for the series that makes it more realistic despite being a science fiction. \\n\\n\r\nThe series traces its roots with the survival of the fittest theme although it doesn't involve any game elements. Instead, it's a military type series that involves with one force and the other. There can only be one winner on each side: mankind or the BETA. As such, the battles in the series are often intense when they happen that draws the violence, brutality, and blood from the skies. The characters drawn are visually presented well and gets their points across. However, the mecha department lacks a bit of this quality. Although crisp, the mecha themselves seems to be trying too much to become..mecha. However, the emotions and drama mixed in is a surprisingly exciting watch. It shows the dangers mankind have been and will be facing. \\n\\n\r\nYet despite the serious tone of the series, there is a lot of interactions between the main characters later on. For later on, Yuuya becomes less aggressive and more caring towards his colleagues treating them as friends rather than comrades. His interaction with Yui is one of the more dynamic focuses in the series as he inspires her that she can create a path the way she wants. This opened up new doors of opportunities for a more caring relationship between the two. Hmm, maybe not because it seems that there are also other women interested in Yuuya. In some of the later episodes, Yuuya becomes the center of attention who attracts the attention of the many other female characters in the series. It's funny in a strange way to realize that in such a dark atmosphere that the BETA has already created, there can also be some space for fun and laughter. \\n\\n\r\nAs said before, the artwork of the series is presented in a way that reflects the more serious tone of the Muv Luv world in which survival of mankind depends on these new generation of trained pilots. The pilots themselves are drawn well and those tight suits the ladies wear are the eye candies. On the other hand, the mecha drawn are less than average and focuses too much on themselves. They are just there for the military purposes of battling the BETA with not too many special characters. The BETA themselves however gives off that alien invasion like feeling with their artwork designs of the horns, teeth, stingers, etc. Their behavior in the series shows that they are there to invade and expects nothing less than a fight to the death. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall music/soundtrack for the series is above par but sometimes tries to be too forceful.  \"Go to the top\" by Kumi Koda  shows a montage of all the main characters as well as a few glances of the vicious BETA. Some of the more emotional flashbacks gives off a soft melody that reflects the sadness of the Muv Luv world. A few of the characters went through a harsh past and it ultimately made them who they are today. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Muv Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse is one of those mecha series where it tries to balance out the grim reality of the war and the drama between the main characters. The reality of the war is there as we can see from Yui's past and what she has gone through. But at the same time, there is new hope as she finds new friends and allies to move on from that past. Yuuya's interactions with the other characters also shows that he is a caring person rather than just an obnoxious self-centered pilot as some of us believed him to originally be. There is also the blushing, the potential romance, as well as what is in hope for a better future. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Muv Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse is an underrated series that some of us may have looked past this year. Perhaps if we faced a more harsher reality in today's world, we might become more self aware. But it's worth giving it a shot especially if you're digging into some science fiction drama. \\n",

            "content": "Mecha anime is sometimes for most of people would avoid this one like me. It isnt about taste matter but sometimes we find mecha anime tends to be boring and repetitive. Like, they always about battle, battle and battle. They just focussing on that matters without leaving characters to develop. But back then, i am being suggested to watch Muv Luv Alternative and i must said, it was a great experience\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nMuv Luv Alternative Total Eclipse or should i say, Muv Luv. Is one from many anime that taking mecha as their main themes. But the differences between them, is they didnt focus about mechavs mecha like gundam. but its more about Mecha vs Alien. in this anime, we called alien as BETA. The story goes when The \"BETA\" has invaded on the earth. As the humanity is on the edge, UN and Japanese Imperial make a weapon to against them. Its called TSF. Tactical Surface Fighter or we can say the name for the mecha or robot. Yui Takamura and Yuuya Bridges as the MC must against the BETA who tried to take over the earth, could they did it?\\n\\n\r\nAt the first glimpse, we can merely imagine this anime would about this giant robot destroying every BETAs easily without any problem with their lasers and moreover, thinking this anime would heavily about mecha battle. Well, you can throw away that perception after watching this. in the first episode we're being served by a really dark atmosphere. Despair, hopeless and emotional moments is blended in this one. I am pretty excited about the first time when i watch this. Well, after some episode It changes. In this anime, It doesnt always about creepy and dark moments like before but also light things like comedy and more even, romance. Though the comedy and romance isnt the prominent things in this anime but its good to balanced with the heavy story on it. Moreover, the romance isnt cheesy and cheap. Moreover, its quite touching and  naturally flowing between on each characters. The comedy isnt that bad too, though sometimes it isnt really funny but at least we would get smile by watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace in this anime is rather slow than any mecha anime that i've ever seen. They have some backgrounds story for some characters and they way how they tells each of something (like BETA and or about the plan) is quite detailed and the word that they are using for explaining things is quite easy to understand. So, it isnt really hard to follow this story.\\n\\n\r\nART (10/10)\\n\r\nThis is maybe the strongest aspects on this anime, art. Muv Luv is extremely doing it well on this aspects. They way the use 3D art on the mecha is suprisingly good. I mean, look at the movements for the mecha or TSF is so smooth and moreover it doesnt crashed with the 2D background, its  feels like they are one. Not just the 3D aspects, the picture in this anime is also vivid, beautiful and sharp. Well,it doesnt so surprising since the producer is satelight which is known for making anime with vivid color like fairy tail. Though sometimes the art in this anime is changing, like when some dramatic or despair scenes comes it turns to more darker and serious tones. Honestly, the  changing between it, isnt really matter furthermore, its increasing the atmosphere feels in that scenes. Beside of  all that, The most interesing things again about the art is the character design. You will found so many interesting  character in design aspects and of course eye-candy for men since we would see so many beautiful girls with tight clothes and moreover, the art in this anime is supporting for making this \"view\" more delicious.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (8/10)\\n\r\nFrom the sound section, Honestly i love the opening song in this anime \"Go to the top\" by Kumi Koda is really suitable with the this anime. Electric tunes and slow hip hop beat in this song is really catchy. The animation that appears while the song is played is also great. Its presentating every characters that would appears and of course the great 3D mecha art is still there and for the ED, its doesnt  really memorable and honestly the song is a little bit of. Moving on to character sound, the seiyuu in this anime is actually is good. For Yuuya, he is being voiced by Ono Daisuke which is known for his role on shizuo (Durarara) and for Takamura Yui, she is being voiced by Mai Nakahara which known for her role in Nagisa (clannad). Those two seiyuu is the proof for the quality of the sound characters, They are really suitable with the roles that they have. Like Yui Voice when in dere mode, Mai Nakahara can pulling that one off. though sometimes the voice is a little bit off but its still pretty enjoyable to hear their voice.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (9/10)\\n\r\nAfter the art, the most prominent things in Muv Luv is the characters. What i love from this series is the personality that each characters has. Like Yuuya, our main lead. At the first, he is a egoistical characters that only care about himself, he do what he wants to do and doesnt really care about any people, but this negative personality is changing as long as the story goes this characters turns into the one that why this characters deserve as the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nBeside Yuuya, we have Takamura Yui. which is at the first glimpse is your really annoying one. since, as the commanders and the leader for the army she is have a harsh and strict personality that makes you want to punch her right on her head but, like Yuuya as long as the story goes this personality is changing and I can safely said Yui would make the viewers fallin in love with her. especially when she is in her dere mode.\\n\\n\r\nBeside two of those, Muv Luv have another main characters, its scarlet twins. Like its name, Scarlet twins is consists of two people, Cryska and Inia. Those two people have two big differents in personality. If inia is like your imouto type which is clingy type and sweet, Cryska is more mature and strict like Yui. She is basically just do what she is ordered. The reflection between them is what makes scarlet twins is loveable and wanna makes rooting for them.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what can i say is all the characters (not just the main characters) in this anime is really enchanting and you will ended up rooting for them, One thing that particulary that Muv Lu lack is some of them  sometimes appears just for the decoration like the three girls from UN. They appears without affecting the characters nor the story, they appears Without any use. Its being wasted i think. Beside of it, like i have mention before, the characters developments in Muv Luv is really handled very well. Every thing that happen between them is affecting their personality, like Yui that gradually have an interest with Yuuya. Anyway, We dont just see the battles but also the drama within it and what makes them changed especially in the personality like Yuuya or Yui does.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (9/10)\\n\r\nin the end, i must say i satisfied with what i have watched. spending nearly for 8 hours just for watching this series is really pays off. I even didnt realize that i had in the last episode. The art, story and the characters is the one why i can sitting down quietly watching this anime. Honestly, Mecha isnt my things. But this one is different, i felt this one is totally different from what i expect from mecha anime. The harem and romance aspects is probably the one that surprise me a lot from this series. Well, who knows that harem+mecha is turn out into a great combination? Anyway, i really recommend this anime if you seek for pleasure and great anime.\\n\\n\r\n*Feedbacks are needed, thanks!*\\n",

This review is only after seeing the first 2 episodes so my opinion may change down the road but i like what i see so far. I am not a fan of mecha .. at all. I from time to time will give it a chance to see how the story develops.  This story has the normal details of alien invasion and people flying around killing they enemy and how the world is at war. Yes im fully aware this plot hasbeen used and abused over and over. However this one is different. It gives you a further detail back story to certain characters and how friendship builds and watching your own friends die. It is extremely graphic when it comes to blood and violent death. The 2nd episode was spectacular. There were moments it make my skin crawl and i love horror anime so im use to it but the details of the story and build up is what makes it fantastic. I do not want to throw in any spoilers but i highly recommend you give this series a shot even if you dont like mecha because it may surprise you.",

            "content": "Aliens, known as the B.E.T.A, invade our planet in the year 1973. They mindlessly attack humans and devour us like food. There is no way to communicate with these B.E.T.A , so our only option left is to fight them. To do so, we humans invent giant humanoid machines called Tactical Surface Fighters (or TSFs). Pilots are trained to man these machines and fight in the front lines against the B.E.T.A forces; however, this is not a story about those who fight in the front lines. This is a side story about the test pilots who make sure the TSFs are suitable for use onthe front lines.\\n\\n\r\nA side story...most people lower their expectations when they hear this. Side stories are usually not as good because they are simply a tool used to promote the main series. This is pretty much the case for Muv-luv Alternative: Total Eclipse. It is a spin-off of the original Light Novel series, Muv-Luv Alternative. With that in mind, i walked into this anime with lowered expectations. I advise you all to do the same.\\n\\n\r\nIt all started out fine. The B.E.T.A invades Japan, and our heroine Takamura Yui fights them off with her friends. They are in turn horribly massacred by the B.E.T.A, and Yui is forced to watch as her friends get eaten alive right before her eyes. A dark and bloody atmosphere is built by the third episode... but then that atmosphere gets destroyed almost instantly. It becomes extremely obvious a few episodes later that the first two episodes were a trap.\\n\\n\r\nTotal Eclipse switches from that dark and brooding atmosphere to a beach episode in just a few episodes. It almost becomes a sort of romance/slice of life anime later on. The story then starts to become more and more inconsistent. They go from people getting eaten alive in Japan to a military base in Alaska. From there they go to a beach resort and then another military base in Russia.They eventually even end up in a hot spring somewhere and somehow. By the time we get to the halfway point of the series, almost no traces of the feeling gotten from the first two episodes remained. The inconsistency of the setting makes the plot a jumbled mess, and it becomes increasingly difficult to understand where it is going. \\n\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings towards the characters in Total Eclipse. I don't hate them, but i do not exactly like them either. Our main hero,Yuyaa Bridges is pretty much your average day superman. Nothing can get pass his thick, thick Plot Armor. He gets surrounded by hundreds of B.E.T.A? He cuts them down and leaves with a nearly broken machine. He gets surrounded by a group of other TSFs? Gets off without a scratch. It becomes harder and harder to believe that this man can get so lucky.\\n\\n\r\nYou would think that his luck would run out near the end, but it does not. Somehow, out of nowhere, this guy manages to create a Harem during the last few episodes. There is almost no prior development with any members of his harem except Yui. They all flock to him for simple generic reasons like, \"he is a nice guy\", or \"he is super talented\". It looked like the writers just wanted to mix in as many genres as they possibly could. The romance looked really force and it in turn made most of the characters look very shallow. That is not to say i hated the cast of characters. I personally found them amusing to watch despite being very generic and boring at times. By generic i mean they all fitted specific stereotypes. Yuuya was the all powerful main character. Yui was your text book example of a tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Total Eclipse can be very deceiving. A majority of the scenes would be drawn and animated very well. This puts up the appearance that the series' artwork is actually well done; however, there would always be a handful of scenes where the animators got extremely lazy. In these scenes, the characters would look like weird blobs with a face and clothes. Said scenes were done very poorly and degrades the overall quality of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nI have always been very lenient on mech animations. I like them all no matter what, and Total Eclipse was no exception. The TSFs artwork and animation were impressive, but there was one problem. All of the TSFs looked the same. The only difference was a variety in colors. Everything else about them were so similar that it was hard for me to tell which was which. A team of TSFs would all look exactly the same, so telling them apart was nearly impossible.\\n\\n\r\nMusic was the best aspect of this series for me. I loved every track from the first opening and ending to the second opening and closing song. The first opening \"Go to the top\" took a unique and different approach. It was a nice and catchy rock song that went surprisingly well with this anime. The second opening, \"Doubt the World\" gave me shivers with its epic final battle sort of feel. It was an appropriate song for the last few episodes. The ending theme, \"Revise the world\", has probably become one of my favorite ending songs. It had such a sad and intense feel to it. A wonderful song for an epic climax and conclusion to a story. Now if only the ending to Total Eclipse was not so anti-climatic ...\\n\\n\r\nIt might seem like i really hated this series, but i actually quite enjoyed it. A sort of guilty pleasure was what it was. Total Eclipse was obviously something along the lines of sub par, but i found it enjoyable all the same. After all, nothing beats aliens, giant mechs, and hot girls in tight suits.",

I never watched any mecha prior to muv luv, so do pardon me.\r\nStor/Characters: 8/10 & 7/10\r\nIn the short span of 2 eps, I can already feel the depth of the story. Characters are developed well; fear and gore appropriately conveyed. The progress (training, war) is realistic too.\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nThe art style feels old, like pre-2006 era of anime. Graphics are not sharp, though blood and dismembered body parts are shown clearly.\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nI like how the music came in at turning points, where the MC is saved. Also, the bgm create a scary ambience. Not tomention the screams -- those are portrayed well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed both episodes so far; there isn't a moment of dullness. I'd recommend Muv-Luv to anyone looking for a good wartime anime, or simply a mecha one.",

So this is one of studio Satelight's  anime for the last part of 2012 eh? So this 24 episode anime is something which was combined with \"Starship Troopers\" with the usual Jap mech, for me the plot was good, but I really don't like this anime's setting where the BETA onslaught begun in 1973 and it continue 'til 2001?????? I guess the first director, TakayukiInagaki seems to be shitting us audience. Also, I kinda hate the scenario where the cold war seems to be on, except here the coldwar  is a 4 way stand-off between the USA, Imperial Japan, China and USSR instead of the realistic 2 way. Though their animosity among the superpowers may have been put on hold due to the BETA onslaught, there is still that distrust the exist between them, and as much as I hate to say it this anime is more focus on man's distrust with one another rather than the invader, it was very obvious as the BETA's here are more like  a calamity than an enemy and the battle of the TSF against the BETA's are more of a side show than anything else. The romance and the harem element did provide a good mood as this anime's filler, but it was rather disappointing that the man's battle with the BETA's ended in a cliffhanger and so as the Yuuya's harem, instead it ended with man fighting against man , if one ask me who would I like Yuuya to be his love interest my choice is split between Cryska and Yui. About the TSF, well unlike other anime's with a mech genre, this one at least in this anime's illustrator's point of view was a bit lame, e.g. why can't those TSF take off vertically? Why don't they have any energy weapons? Why is it that they don't use medium thermonuclear rounds against those bigger BETA's? Also, though the TSF design differs from country to country, the differences are too minimal that one can't tell which is which, seems like the illustrator was more focus on the TSF's art than the mechanical aspect and the same goes for the flight suit that those so called Eishi used ( Why couldn't they just be called pilots?) in which it was design as a body hugging outfit that makes them eishi's look like that they were wearing nothing, then gain it does look good on the girls especially those with big boobs. The character are pretty much way predictable at least from episode 3 up to the end, which is safe to say that episode 1 and 2 was all on Yui, Yuuya character's is quite unique since he was portrayed as an underdog first by Yui then by the soviets and in the last episode he's now the big shot, for the most part Cryska and Inia are more like romantic teasers for Yuuya. To be honest, I can't say much about this anime since part of me says that it's overrated and one part of me tells me that it's good, but I guess it's up one's self as how he finds all the \"U-turns\" that comes with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMy rating for each category:\\n\\n\r\nSound, character, enjoyment and overall: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nThis is because there are episodes that I find enjoyable, and there are episodes the where underrated.\\n\\n\r\nStory and art: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nthought the execution were a bit off the story and the plot are still good, and as for the art the 7 rating is for female character's fanservice and the way they wore their flight suit. \\n\\n",

            "content": "The first two episodes of this anime grabbed me by the shoulders and shook me around a little. It was pretty brutal, emotional and intense. It created a very dark tone, which I was pretty excited about but then I got to the third episode and everything changed. Did it change for the worst? Well that's debatable.\r\nThe first couple of eps set the scene. It's end of the world humanity is on the edge of extinction and everyone is dying. Afterwords though every episode just seems to neglect the horrid reality of the world the characters live in. Also the tone I first spoke ofis gone. Muv-luv actually seems to have trouble trying to decide what its going for. One episode it's a fight to the death with every character in danger the next its a harem party at a hot spring!? If you can get passed the inconsistencies with the story then you, like me, will enjoy muv-luv.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the reasons would be the characters. I ended up rooting for everyone and couldn't really pick a favorite. Character development is handled very well. We get enough insight into the main characters lives to really feel for them and the supporting characters are just as good even without going into the same depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was outstanding even in every episode. I loved the Mecha and character designs and the actions scenes(WHICH ARE AWESOME) are animated beautifully everything feels so smooth and is just a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the up and down story I really enjoyed Muv-Luv it was emotionally engaging at times then even hilariously funny. The mecha battles are exciting and when the story does start to lead somewhere it does actually get quite intense. It's not the best Mecha anime I've every seen but it is certainly better than a lot of others in it's field. A solid 7 a good anime and one that deserves a watch if you have the time!",

            "content": "Here is a short and sweet version.\r\nSince 1973, an alien called the BETA has been invading earth. Things to know about the BETA: we know almost nothing, There are several categories, and the first three minutes a pilot spends on the battlefield against them are known as the Three Minutes of Death, because it is rare for anyone to survive longer than that, even with giant robots. This story is not about the overall defeat of the BETA, but more like a major point amidst the chaos of the war. The setting is Alaska at a testing facility for the TFS robots and weapons. Thereare several layers of characters in this anime, such as nation, the facility, the testing groups, the characters themselves, and other entities like Refugees groups and the military. Each character/entity/group is individualized and can be viewed as a person all on his/her/its own which is very amazing feat. The main character is Yuuya Bridges. The story is mostly about him coming to terms with the Japanese part of hi Japanese-American heritage. The story does this by personifying his Japanese heritage with his Japanese test robot. Through several story arcs of different types, he slowly begins to understand how his robot works and come to grip with his heritage. To help him is his own group, and Yui Takamura, his Japanese Commanding officer with a tragic past. That is the main gist of the story. \\n\r\nHere is the detailed version.\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nWhat? An 7? Yes, an 7. The story really isn't all that original. It is your generic \"Aliens are invading, only part of the world is still inhabitable and so all of us Nations are sharing it.\" (kind of like Strike Witches, no offense to Strike Witches). But if it's so generic, why did I give it an 7? Because it is still very different. Normally, an anime like this would focus on a hero of some sort with a special machine and abilities who can kill everything, but this anime takes a different approach. Bridges is definitely an Ace pilot, just like all of the other test pilots, but he hates being a test pilot, he would rather be on the field fighting. So why pull top ranks from the field to test robots?  Because a skilled pilot is needed to test robots that could have all sorts of bugs in them. Part of this story is in fact about Bridges coming to grips with the handling and control of his Japanese style robot. Bridges himself is Japanese-American, but he despises Japan because he believes them to be cowards, and he thinks his robots fighting style is built in all wrong. His fight with learning to pilot the robot is parallel to him coming to grips with his Japanese heritage. Though the BETA are a major part in this story, they aren't the main focus. The focus is rather Bridges and his groups own personal struggle against each other and other nations. (I will talk more about this in the character section.) As well as the nations of earth fighting against each other while fighting the BETA. What do I mean? While they all want to defeat the BETA, each nation wants to cripple the other ones, that way when the BETA are defeated, then one nation will be able to stand above them all. This story also brings into view the relations of the characters as people, and as citizens of other countries, but more on that in the character section. The story is great and contains multiple smaller conflicts within overall major conflicts. It is entertaining and somewhat tragic at the same time. Also, don't be thrown off by the first few episodes. The story begins by following Yui Takamura as a High school student and it shows what happens to her platoon. While this part is horrific and scarring, it serves as an important basis for Yui's character later on and is crucial. MOVING ON!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nI love the art in this anime. The characters are drawn and animated beautifully, but more than that, i love the animation of the fights. Because we are dealing with robots, the robots are 3D and so are the BETA. this makes the fight scenes much more dramatic and capturing. Artists do a good job capturing the emotions of the characters in their faces as well as in the scripts. The BETA have very unique designs and traits that are nearly impossible to copy without blantantly ripping them off, and are very wonderfully animated. Explosions are not over done, and the blood sprays are almost beautiful, except that they are blood. NEXT!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI love the OP theme for this anime. It catches the intense action and sudden changes of this anime. It shows character motivation and it\u2019s got a good beat. The lip syncing is good, and the sound effects are also great. The cries from the BETA are easily distinguishable as cries of pain or aggression. The voice actors\u2019 portrayal of emotion in their voices is also superb. The machines whir, and the monsters scream. Swords buzz with energy and guns shout with bullets. It kept me on the edge of my seat. \\n\r\nCharacter ( my favorite\uf04a): 10\\n\r\nThis story has multiple characters, and each character exists on a different level. This is best seen in Cryska: she is Russian and is thus ultimately loyal to the Motherland. In her test group, which is her and her little sister Inia, she will do anything to help Inia and hurt anyone who gets near her including \u201cthe Motherland\u201d.  Then she exists as herself, something she has trouble doing after being raised in communist Russia. She doesn\u2019t understand her own emotions, and doesn\u2019t overall know what she wants.  If you look at Yuuya Bridges, He is loyal to America, despises Japan and Yui (cuz she is Japanese and for no other reason). He exists as the \u201cleader\u201d of his team. And as an individual does what he thinks is best on the whole, disregarding everyones\u2019 orders. There are also lots of entities in this anime. Entities fall into three or for basic categories: Russia, America, Japan, and the BETA. Russia and Japan are the big ones, and this is highlighted by the relationship between Cryska and Yuuya. America is more of just \u201cyeah we survived you guys all owe us.\u201d And the BETA are used as a rallying point to say, \u201cWe are all on the same side.\u201d They aren\u2019t actually that lame, though. \\n\r\nThis anime also does an amazing job with the side characters. Everyone from the waitress at the bar to the mechanic in the hangar manages to form a connection with you. They are round even though they barely get screen time. While there is a set group of characters, this anime does a fantastic job of integrating new people, and disposing of other ones.  Personally, I believe that the ability to connect with the characters really builds into an anime and helps direct the flow. You know what a character will do based on their mindset, and this anime does a great job of leaving you guessing without making you cringe. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI often had to take breaks while watching this anime, and I hated every moment of it. This anime always has a sense of suspense in it and in multiple ways. There is a suspense between the characters, between the BETA and the humans, and between the entities, all of which is tied together in one form or another. It left me wondering \u201cwhat happens next?\u201d without some lame dramatic reveal at the end like: \u201cwe just found her dead\u201d \u2013roll credits-. While it does have some of those cheesy romantic suspense moments like \u201cWhat do I feel for him\u201d and \u201cWhat is love?\u201d it still kept my attention and made up for it with battle scenes, in which anything that could possibly go wrong probably did. As a result, I think a 9 is pretty fair. \\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nWhy? Read the above and then watch the anime. You won\u2019t regret it. \\n",

            "content": "Prelude\r\nMuv-Luv is a franchise well known amongst westerners as \u201cthe best\u201d visual novel ever made, and has a surprisingly big fan base. But most don\u2019t know that the Visual Novel franchise is actually based on a Light Novel series, which no one has probably read outside of those who read Chinese translated books or Japanese\u2026The reason why everyone liked the whole game was because it takes itself seriously and the characters have actual motifs for their actions, not feeling like dolls that can be played around with.\r\nAnd thus, it became what it is today, but I\u2019m not here reviewing the Visual Novel, but theanimated adaption of the side Light Novel.\\n\\n\r\nReview Part: Intro Presentation\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTotal Eclipse is set in the year 2001 where humanity is on the verge of extinction due to encountering an unkown species, which later are named to The Beings of Extra Terrestrial origin which is Adversary of human race or shortly put (BETA).\\n\r\nThe first character to die halfway in the first episode with the phrase \u201ceh?\u201d which she states after a character blatantly warns her 5 seconds earlier that she should watch out. \\n\r\nAnd you\u2019re support to be like \u201cOH NO! WHY?!\u201d or the scene where her friend tells her \u201cShoot me!\u201d but she misses every single shot with her dying in vain, crying like a baby, which afterwards she gets saved by plot convenience to extend her role in the story, pretty bold if you ask me. \\n\\n\r\nReview Part: Characters\\n\r\nThe characters in Total Eclipse are a mix of all types of anime\\n\r\nstereotypes sexualized to the point of no return. Of course, there are a few exceptions. But the main dish just feels uneasy on the eyes or distracting to focus on the story or character motives, because you\u2019ll be staring at their huge melons or the weird spandex suit. The characters themselves are barely memorable as well. We have the MC being that arrogant pro who can\u2019t do anything because he hasn\u2019t mastered the ways of Japanese Tactical Surface Fighter, as different countries build them based on different uses. Americans brute force, Russians Maneuverability and power, Japanese mostly Maneuverability so it can jump around like Mario.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast are there to help him change his view on how he should use them. As they pretty much can\u2019t afford to lose trust between themselves. Seriously, the characters were so forgettable except one or two that I\u2019ll end up missing them entirely. VG is a notable character who cracks/does perverse jokes but has an attitude which actually hits the soft spot.\\n\\n\r\n Especially his Dub actor, he did an outstanding job to portray him. Bridges is your Eren Jaeger who has no personality or reason at all except being there causing drama or dumb plot-twists that will make you raise a brow or scratch your head. Takamura is the main female lead that is a literal tsundere, nothing much to note on her, throughout the course of the story she doesn\u2019t change. And no, her relationship with the Bridges doesn\u2019t go anywhere. Cryska and her sister are pretty much the equivalent of little sister loves MC, elder one doesn\u2019t but eventually falls in love. Yes folks, it\u2019s a love quadrangle. She\u2019s an emotionless killer who turns into a yandere because plot called it. There are of course. Much more characters, but I hardly remember what they wanted to do or their motives in the show, which leaves a very poor example of the show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nReview Part: Storytelling & Arcs\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story telling is led by a predictable outcomes and unconving reactions to be taken seriously. It constantly changes to unrelated topics about the show and its characters. First it\u2019s a training drama about surviving the beta attack and helping humanity in further developing TSFs to improve their chance of survival then all of a sudden we go to a Beach arc about how the MC is treated as shit because he\u2019s Half-Japanese I mean seriously? Oh and it gets better. Another few training sessions come in, but focus mostly their back stories which is good, but when the story does nothing so you can remember these characters you just don't want to care either way. The pacing changes from fast to slow at random, throughout the first 5 episodes where they build on relationships with characters and their motives they change to drama about going to the girls hot spring then all of a sudden into a the-military-does-not-respect-us-civilians drama. The whole testing pilot thing literally stays true for only \u00bc of the series and no more. Presenting multiple plot holes and nonsensical reasonings which of course mean nothing in the long run, because it ends up being a shonen-style storytelling where the power of believing will make the day bright again. Technically after the arcs could\u2019ve been made way better by expanding on the series for more than 26 episodes and actually do something with its themes and characters and not end up in just another forgettable cash-in.\\n\\n\\n\r\nReview Part: Production values and music\\n\r\nAnimation \\n\\n\r\nOh boy, here is the thing where it made me want the show to have been done by Sunrise and not Satelight. For a war drama that focuses mostly on robot fighting, the robot themselves are Computer-Generated meaning that half of the animation just dies, which not to say that it had any spectacular animation to begin with. So the drop in quality is quite high regardless of what you\u2019rewatching\u2026The PowerPoint presentation walking or running animation is distracting, so to save budget they mostly sit around doing nothing and talk for an eternity, even the enemies are CG it really fell flat here, there was nothing redeemable about it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Designs \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are one note and pretty basic, you have short hair mid length hair short hair differences. One note backgrounds, and semi-post apocalyptic landscape here and there. Nothing special really, they didn\u2019t even try improving the already existing designs or backgrounds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic and usage\\n\\n\r\nThe music is mostly forgettable, but fits the scenario pretty well. Considering most of the times nothing specific happens, and the overall action scenes are little. There was one insert song by Granrodeo which was a good insert song that played twice. And one at the end of ep 4, the rest is either reenacted from the VN ost mixed with anime original, and it\u2019s pretty poorly used. The 4 action scenes that actually played those 2 insert songs was nice to listen to while the fight was going in the background but in the end, it fell off the rope and went straight down the lake.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\r\nIn conclusion it\u2019s a below average production that really has nothing for you to bother wasting your time with, I have a dim recollection of the characters exactly 7 days after I finished it. Of course, it may only be worth it if you want to break it down.",

            "content": "There is one and only one way that could have saved this series from being more than just eye candy without any thought behind it:\r\nDo not try to take a dating sim concept, and turn it into a legitimate anime by throwing in mindless racist attacks against America.\r\nThe first two episodes were good just for getting the concept behind the enemy, and the horrors of war straight. However, who in their right mind, when the species is on the line, sends a bunch of teenage girls who represent the best, brightest descendants of the Imperial heritage of Japan, out to the front lines? That iscalled STUPID! There is a reason in most American sci-fi that the best and brightest are usually saved in reserve or their talents are used to help in other areas: you want those particularly smart people to make babies for the next generation to be the best and brightest, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, nowhere in this anime is there any tactics or strategy that make any kind of sense, or offer the species any chance of survivability. The \"circling and descending\" attacks Yui brags about that the underpowered, gutless 94 Second is designed to do are the same tactical maneuvers Japanese Zero pilots used to effectively die in the gunsights of American Wildcat, Hellcat, and Corsair aviators.\\n\\n\r\nFor serious discussions on proper ACM tactics, please refer to Colonel John Boyd's \"Aerial Attack Study\", Energy-Maneuverability Theory, and the OODA Loop.\\n\\n\r\nThird: Who in their right mind builds a bunch of mecha to fight an overwhelming swarm of bugs (that of course have to have eyes, hands, heads, and mouths, even though they share no genetic similarities whatsoever to Earth lifeforms), when a simple EM cannon carried by one mecha can decimate an entire force of the enemy? Why not build a couple strategic bomber aircraft to sweep the Earth with these weapons at altitude, and avoid the messy business of killing humans unnecessarily? Oh right... because we can't have a plot driven off of anything except hand to hand combat with monsters!\\n\\n\r\nFourth: Ever since \"Blood+\" made that horrible effigy of Condoleeza Rice bragging about how Americans all want to conquer the world, I've been slowly turning off anime. This series is the straw that has broken the camel's back. Since WWII, America has profusely apologized to a nation it had to strike with two nuclear devices because the Imperial military was so hell-bent on fighting to the last man, over a quarter of the Earth's population would have been lost by the end of the war. Nevermind a pacifist movement in Japan's own citizens were cheering for America's resolution to drop the bomb, but even after over 60 years of rebuilding and peacetime, the Japanese still do not understand why they lost the war, and blame the \"blue eyed devils\" for all their problems.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, Muv-Luv is an exercise to duplicate the fanbase of Hetalia by stereotyping certain cultures in the series, and somehow trying to rewrite history to show Japan as an Imperialist nation would be feasible in the modern world.\\n\\n\r\nAll that's missing is Yui saying \"and I would have gotten away with it, if it weren't for you meddling kids, and your dog!\"",

Well I turned out to be a bit wrong about this one. While the first 2 episodes of the series were what I was looking for things then took a hard left turn. The episodes after number 2 have been on the development of another main character and pushing the main of the first 2 episodes to the side somewhat. It also has taken away the dark aspect and made it more of a lighter hey look at me andsee what I am learning how to do. While I still like the mecha aspect of this anime the story development has left me confused and wondering if I wish to continue this anime. Well we shall see!\\n",

            "content": "----------NO SPOILERS PAST EPISODE 1-----------\r\nSet in the past. Better technology then we have now? How could anything so ridiculous sounding be great? Well read this if your just looking for a good anime to watch, or if you want to know the answer to my question. This is a review of the Fall 2012 anime: Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse. Enjoy \r\nStory: 10\r\nMuv-Luv Alternative : Total Eclipse was a very unique anime. It is set in a past that has scientifically passed our current age technology. They have mecha-bots called TSF's which they use to fight the BETA. An alien species that is just bent ondestroying the earth and wiping out the Humans. When I read the mecha tag I thought here we go again, another mecha anime, but surprisingly this one turned out to be extremely different. Yuuya Bridges is a Half American Half Japanese ensign, a TSF pilot. Being one of the top American TSF pilots he is sent to Alaska to work on a joint American Japanese TSF research project. There he meets the Japanese lady named Yui Takamura, who teaches Yuuya many things. About him and fighting the BETA.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe character art was amazing, but whenever the BETA came around they looked way too realistic. They looked amazing, but when ever people where getting hurt the graphics looked to realistic. When the bullets hit the flesh the blood coming out was to realistic. They were the only fully 3d object in the 2d world of Total Eclipse. Out of place but amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThis anime is like most anime, I can only remeber 2 OST's from this anime. The only reason I gave this a 7 was for the first opening \"Go To The Top\"  In my opinion the this was a really great opening. Other then that was the OST playing in the last episode while he was being a bada**.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe character development was simply put amazing. Each main character has their own specific background story that somewhat ties into the anime and how its told. Sometimes it may seem like its somewhat confusing, but sooner than later it will make complete sense. The main character is a great one and I hope you'll come to like him just like I did (not in a yaoi way lol).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement 9\\n\r\nSundays at 7, thats when it came out subbed on the sight that I watched it on. Every Sunday I would make sure I had time to see Total Eclipse. I followed it everyday and the only episode I watched late was the 20th, which was a recap episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 \\n\r\nFrom a non biased point of view this anime deserves an 8 when I take into consideration all of the points that make up this anime. All in all this was a great anime, that most people need to watch one time or another. Also, A warning, this anime is addicting. :)\\n\\n\r\n-StellerScale",

To make it as short as possible, this is an alternate universe where historical events played out differently and humans put their backs out during the space age. Leading to humans first encountering the BETA, on Mars, then going to war against them on the Moon, until finally they landed on Earth back in 73'(at the height of the Cold War). This anime starts in 1998, by this time the BETA have already taken(which means they have eaten eveyone and everythingin their path) the whole continent of Eurasia(and the Soviets retreated to Alaska)\\n\\n\r\n____________Visual novel Spoilers (this info isnt in the anime) __________\\n\\n\r\nBETA:\\n\r\nAre biological machines sent out to planets to collect resources for their silicone based lifeform creators.\\n\\n\r\nThe BETA also recycle everything they eat including dead BETA (so they eat their dead, our dead, The plants, animals, even the dirt, and rocks, and they make more BETA.)\\n\\n\r\nThe BETA consume everythin and in the terriortories that the BETA overrun the land is stripped bare to the point where once there was a forest all thats left is sterile dirt.\\n\\n\r\nIf your wondering why they dont just nuke the BETA its because beyond the blast and heat Nukes have no effect on BETA(probably because they can operate just fine even in outter space)\\n\\n\r\nIf your wondering why they dont just shoot missiles or use air support. Its because a BETA type known as the Laser Class which are able to fire lasers with pen point accuracy and can/will shoot down anything(Birds, planes, missiles) in the thats going slower then speed of light from a extreme distance\\n\\n\r\nIf your wondering why the humans are losing the BETA war. \\n\\n\r\n1. BETA have eaten more then Half the Human Population(to the point where even 12 year olds are drafted into the military)\\n\r\n2. BETA with their laser class Control the skies\\n\r\n3. In the Alternte universe humans have waged even more wars on eachother even after the BETA landing on earth\\n\r\n4. The US is making TSF's that are made to fight other TSFs (dumbasses)\\n\r\n5. The BETA Keep coming in greater and greater numbers\\n\r\n6. The average survival time for a new TSF pilot is 8 minutes\\n\r\n7. It takes BETA only Months to replace their losses\\n\r\n8. The BETA vanguard units(Destroyer Class) are over 20 meters tall and have Armor thats Mohs hardness 15(which is 5 levels above diamond) and run at 170 kph\\n\r\n9. The Height of the BETA is between 2.3 meters to over 100 meters (most of the time they are fighting the ones that are 15+ meters tall and are bigger then a 2 story house (though the Tank class is the size of a tank it has the strength to rip off a turret of a tank and eat the goodies inside...))\\n\\n\r\nFun fact Most TSF use Names from actual Military aircraft (It is an alternate universe after all) the very first TSF was the F-4 Phantom\\n\\n\r\nG-material is mentioned at the end of the series but no explanation is given.\\n\\n\r\nG-Material is what the BETA process gathered material into and is used as a power source\\n\r\nG-Material was collected by humans when the second BETA landing pod touched down in Cananada and the US nuked the hell out of them before they could start creating laser class in any number. All that was left was the BETA G-material and most of Cananda bacame radio-active.(which is far better then letting the BETA live)\\n\\n\r\nHumans use G-Material to create G-bombs(basically Blackhole bombs), which are insanely effective against the BETA however their side effect are just as bad as letting the BETA live or worse(nuke radiation is like nothing compared to it)\\n\r\nAfter effects include:\\n\r\n- Steriliazation of the land\\n\r\n- Complete loss of everything within the blast radius\\n\r\n- Creating Tidal waves Miles high\\n\r\n- Sinking land/raising land from the ocean\\n\r\n- Completely blocks almost any kind of signal\\n\r\n- Gravity anomalies\\n\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly being nuked is far far far far better then being G-bombed\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nThis story takes place during the BETA assualt on Japan the first 2 episodes are dark and gloomy, however after that the anime becomes far more light hearted. The real story takes place in Yukon 2 years later, where TSF(giant robots) manufactures(Argos Test Flight is a Japanese development team, which this story is focused on) are testing and improving weapons to fight the beta. Argos Test Flight is thrown into different situations on purpose or not trying to make the Japanese TSF the Shiranui 2nd into the best TSF it can possibly be for fighting the BETA. If you wanted more of what the first 2 episode are like watch the spin off Schwarzesmarken.\\n\\n\r\nThe 3D models of the TSFs stand out alot in some scene and the work really well in others, The Art style is typical early 2010's. (theres also a very high amount of blood, mainly BETA blood)\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds of the TSFs fairly average and surprisingly unlike most animes with giant monster that eat people the BETA for all intensive purposes do not make vocial sounds period. The opening theme is also extremely fitting for the tone of the first 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a very mixed bag.\\n\\n\r\nYui Takamura - we see her in her first battle then see becomes a hard ass at the end of episode 2. However the instant she meets Yuuya Bridges she goes from Bitch to Bitch in heat in less time then it took the BETA to eat her friend in episode 2.\\n\\n\r\nYuuya Bridges - hes a very different character from most animes MC's. This one a a Racists who hates the japanese even though hes half japanese. At first he utterly Hates Yui but then his character shifts just as fast as Yui's, Though he still hates being called japanese.(hes also a really good TSF pilot( or so they say...))\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the Scarlett sisters. They are just two Soviet girls who were raised together and one of them is an Esper. (and what do ya know they also fall for Yuuya)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - This anime can be intense one moment and totally light hearted the next. This anime has a decent anmout of fan service, and a decent amount of gore and a LOT of blood(Mainly BETA blood)\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you want to see some fanservice while also fearing that your fav character might get eaten this is the anime for you.",

            "content": "When somebody says the word \"mecha\", we would immediately think action and robot vs robot flying and fighting each other. Yes, muv-luv did have these elements, but it also included the mindset of the characters in it.\r\nI'll get straight to the point, Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse was a great anime that was overlooked by a lot of people. \r\nI'll first mention why I really loved this anime.\r\nStoryline:\r\nI feel like the storyline for Muvluv is very original especially since we get to see and experience what is happening in the backlines during an all-out war.\r\nIt starts off  by giving us a feeling of despair anddarkness because even the most advanced mechas get taken down by the B.E.T.A.. However, after the first two episodes it shifts the point-of-view of the anime towards the events happening in the back lines of the fight. Because of this view, we are given front row seats to see the character relationships and experience the character development more in depth. Although the action is lacking compared to some other mecha anime, MuvLuv makes up for it by showing us the mindset of the people and why they do what they do. But nevertheless, the action scenes were still gorgeous. The story not only tackles issues that are personal, it also ponders national and even global themes. I really love how accurate they show human reaction especially during the brink of despair. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters were very dynamic in a sense that even the interactions were very entertaining. Also, the character development was very interesting to watch, especially for our three \"main\" characters. Yuuya Bridges, Yui Takamura, and Cryska Barchenowa. First about Yuuya, he starts off as a cocky young pilot who thinks he is the best in the world, but then after experiencing near death situations with his comrades, he began to develop not only a sense of humility but also a sense of caring and responsibility. Yui Takamura, a member of the japanese guard on the other hand started off acting like a stuck-up woman to her comrades especially Yuuya. She always was pushing others away and testing them because it was her job. But as the series goes on she eventually removes herself from isolation and accepts the help of others and even make others her role model.\\n\r\nCryska, a member of the soviet flight, started out as a really cold persona, all she cared about was doing the job that was set-out for her and taking care of her \"sister\" Inia. Though, through interactions with the other characters in the story she gradually changes ad in the end found something very worthwhile for her to protect. However, thats not all, the side characters were also very interesting. They were not only there to serve as side characters, a lot of them became catalysts so that the main characters can act on something of have more development. Another addition is that all of the actions of the characters have a drive for it, not just done without just reason.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: The art used in this anime is really beautiful considering the budget allotted for it. The character designs were very detailed and the mechas looked awesome, even the aliens looked crisp and colorful. As for the sound, the first opening, \"Go to the Top\" was very catchy and was destined for this series.\\n\\n\r\nSlight Nuances(spoilers):\\n\r\nThe love triangle that is Yui, Yuuya, and Cryska felt a litle forced at times but was never an actual hindrance to the story. If they wanted to highlight this relationship, they should have done so otherwise utting it to the side might not be a bad idea. They also could have improved the fight scene music to give it a more \"epic\" feeling.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: MuvLuv contains enjoyment that is not found in the surface level. You have to look at the intricacies of the characters and the story itself. Ultimately this was still a very good show that gives us a new view of things both personally and beyond.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy mecha anime that involves much mindset and character development this show is a definite much watch.",

            "content": "I'm curious as to why people have such opposite ratings for this anime. Even if an anime is not that good, I highlight the positive aspects in the best way I can. In my opinion, this anime is great, despite the slow start after the first couple episodes. \r\nStory-7 \r\nTotal eclipse is supposedly based off of a huge group of monsters from another planet which they call BETA and the world is trying to save their world from them. Surprisingly, it doesn't seem to revolve around the BETA itself. The love between Yui and Yuuya was mature and boring, and I just wanted them toget together already. Even so, the involvement with other countries was questionable. I'm not sure why they did it, but it seemed to work out with the story. There were many internal conflicts within the countries because it was mainly between us, Russia, and Japan, all of which were enemies prior to BETA invasion. Rightfully so, they showed the existing tensions, but brought the countries together to end a worldwide catastrophe. Controversial, but acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9 \\n\r\nNothing beats art like mobile suits. I have to say, even if gundams are the dominant looks of mobile suits, muv-luv incorporates their own ideas that I find interesting. Duel blades and dual assault rifles make different fighting styles possible. What I really liked was the animation for the type 99 em radiation cannon. One of the craziest rail guns I've ever seen in my life. Animations are great. Being a first timer to mecha anime, this really captivated me to watch even more. I will say though that there is a lot of gore, mainly due to the TSFs killing the beta. A lot of blood is present, so if you are not a fan of gore, this anime is not for you\\n\\n\r\nSound- 6\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are adequate. They aren't the best, but they do fit the themes in total eclipse. Even after listening to a few times, I just can't seem to like it. Sure, the first opening has a catchy tone don't get me wrong, but it's not a song I would listen to while doing homework or art. The soundtrack is also moderately good. Considering half this anime was romance, a lot of slow tones were present. At like the 3rd or 4th episode, it got really boring because it was a slow conversation, and to top it off, there was no background music to liven up the situation. Wish they had better music\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 8\\n\r\nIt's hard to say whether to like the characters or not. Yui-Hime is definitely awesome and very beautiful, but they make her passive later on since they focus on Yuuya. Yuuya was a complete ass in the beginning, but he knows his place and changes dramatically over time. There are so many characters present it's hard to describe each of them. I think this might even be a harem because cryska, inia, tarisa, and cui all have feelings for Yuuya. I'm not even sure what they are saying about Americans, Russian, and the Chinese in general. Are they good people, or bad based on their claims? I understand that they really try to unify all these countries together, but the choice of people is questionable. Still, some if not most of the elements make sense historically. Please keep in mind the date period in which this anime takes place. US is still in the Cold War against USSR.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall- 9/8\\n\r\nDefinitely entertaining to watch when it comes to the action. My only concern is that when they make a second season, if they do, is that Yui becomes passive again. I will hate that. She is a badass princess and can fight really well. I don't want her to keep depending on Yuuya to save her life. Overall, the anime is fun to watch. Shooting and slicing monsters is something I look forward to later on, as well as the new tactics and strategies that the UN will prepare for next season. If you're into strategic-like action, this is definitely a great anime to watch. To some it is a disappointment. I believe this anime has potential. It's underrated for unknown reasons, even as some reasons I agree, but this anime is entertaining nonetheless. I l look forward to season 2!",

            "content": "Well, my review contains some spoilers:-\r\nThis show is decent from my prospective, It got decent amount of romance, but mainly forwarded to action only, Story is good enough to keep you stick until the last episode, its about aliens which invaded the earth and one by one taking over the countries. Humans are trying everything they can to protect their homeland, they are using high tech mecha's.\r\nIn the beginning i expected the main protagonist (yuya) to be the strongest guy as how he anticipated that there were two mecha just by hearing the voices in the air in his first appearance on the plane. Buthe was weak, he maybe elite in US but it was never showed how good was he...\\n\\n\r\nThe main female has a crush on the main guy, but again until the last episode, she never confessed to him, not even once tried to. \\n\\n\r\nThe guy's personalty is somewhat complicated, sometimes he acts like a pro, and sometimes totally stupid. Yui maybe his love interest but he never made his move, all the other girls in love with him.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part which still in my mind and keeping me frustrated is that story is hanging even on the last episode, Nobody ended up nowhere, Yui went back to japan, the silver haired girl admitted that she loves Yuya and says to Yui that she is her love rival? and starts the ending credits. Is this the hint of second season? I really hate these kinds of anime with senseless ending...\\n\\n\r\nSo if you are into action then this anime definitely for you. If you are into romance stuff then don't even bother watching its trailer, its worthless waste of time. If you want to watch anyway then be prepared to bear the frustration .\\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you",

            "content": "I went in knowing nothing about the story or source material. And so should you if possible. Thus I will do this without spoilers. Also, depending on what type of anime you want to watch, you should either start at episode 3, and go to episode 24, or start at episode 1 and go to episode 2. Really I should be writing two separate reviews on here. I watched subbed, and dubbed, and in my opinion subbed is the only one worth watching.\r\nHumm... what to say... Well I'll start with my favorite parts of the anime. Episodes 1 and 2. And parts like when the\"American\" talks in english (I died laughing... probably one of the funniest scenes of bad voicing ever). I much prefer an anime with character development driving the plot and other parts being secondary, but episodes 1 and 2 throw you right into the fray. It was awesome. I would rate them a 9.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 3-24 get a 5. Much like the visual novel, they revolve around a love story and have less to do with mecha fighting. Not that this is terrible, it just detracts (in my opinion) from the significance of the fighting. Anyways, give it a go if you like mech anime, and try not to throw up as the bodies of the female characters jiggle like gelatin. It worth a watch and hopefully you don't get put off as much as I did if you keep waiting for it to be back like the first two episodes.",

            "content": "I made it 15 episodes in before abandoning ship due to terrible pacing and a plot that goes absolutely nowhere, with the whole series focusing on the wrong character while dragging itself around like an ass-tumor.\r\nOriginally, Muv-Luv is centered on Yui, a trainee forced into the middle of a war with googly-eyed aliens intent on making crunchy snacks of humanity. Then, a couple episodes in, everything shifts over to Yuuya, a boring, monotone, useless moron whose sole reason for existing is to be a Mary Sue for the \"narrative\" to vortex around like a tornado taking an already-wrecked train and wrecking it even more. Yuiis a character with depth, but Yuuya is just another mopey anime doofus with the personality of a marshmallow that's been farted on too many times. In fact, every single other character is more interesting than him, including the French bartender with gravity-defying boobies who only makes rare cameos.\\n\\n\r\nNot only that, but there are super-long dialogue exchanges at the worst possible times. Yuuya and his blond-haired butt buddy finally get through jammed communications, but instead of immediately relaying the information he needed, said butt buddy swoons over Yuuya's health. Then, magically, the communications are re-jammed right as he starts to finally get to the point. Even worse, Yui gets a boo-boo on her arm, and in the middle of a firefight with thousands of toothy alien booger-legs, Yuuya stops everything to give her a band-aid. The delay obviously causes more issues. This pattern repeats itself in every episode, be it pointless exchanges during battle, or lengthy internal monologues that serve absolutely zero purpose other than extending each episode. The straw that broke me was episode 15, where in the middle of a war that's about to literally wipe out humanity, they decide to hold a team competition for bragging rights. OK, neat.\\n\\n\r\nAll I wanted was a cool show with big robutts punching each other, but this is an embarrassment of atrocious pacing. Avoid.",

            "content": "Muv-Luv Alternative: Total Eclipse is an adaptation of a spin-off of a sequel to a sequel to the adaptation of a visual novel, not to be confused with the billions of parallel universes and other media entities sharing either the same name or variations thereof.  I think.  Actually figuring out that chain of evidence was a more rewarding experience than watching the show, and I haven\u2019t even bothered to do it correctly.\r\nThis review contains moderate spoilers for the first two episodes, and perhaps some very broad spoilers for the rest of the show, but I refrained from giving away explicit details and nothinghere should impact your overall experience of the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe first couple of episodes treat us to some of the most slapdash, miserable attempts at background-building and tone-setting you\u2019re likely to see, with a thoroughly uninteresting and uninterested lens shone on brief flashes of antecedent action that become irrelevant immediately after Kyoto gets saturation bombed into a microscopic fragment of a story beat.  The show tries to harvest some pathos right off the bat without having earned anything and for the sole purpose of prepping the audience for more violence once the real story begins.  It\u2019s sloppy and feels more edgy than meaningful.  You couldn\u2019t accurately call Yui Takamura the show\u2019s main character after those first few episodes anyway (one of them, certainly, though the primary protagonist is clearly Yuuya Bridges), so having two whole episodes dedicated to her back story before abruptly shifting into entirely different circumstances only makes the show confusing from the very beginning.\\n\\n\r\nTotal Eclipse focuses on test pilots and support staff operating well behind the lines, telling stories that don\u2019t pertain to the main conflict in which the world is embroiled, at least until the final arc.  That\u2019s a legitimate approach to take \u2013 not every story has to be about heroes in the trenches who win the ultimate victory \u2013 but the show vacillates between high-stakes front-line action and whimsical diversions that seem meaningless by comparison.  If in the first two episodes Yui Takamura experiences the loss of her friends, command structure, and homeland, engages in highly traumatizing and gory combat, and then suffers physical wounds and an emotional breakdown, it doesn\u2019t feel like that big of a deal if the next few episodes focus on her not getting along with her new subordinates.  If one episode throws the characters into a pitched battle resulting in massive casualties and the loss of important territory, I can\u2019t get seriously invested in the inconsequential mock tournament mini-arc that starts the next episode.  Instead, it makes me raise my eyebrows and wonder, \u201cWait, is THIS what this show is about?\u201d  \\n\\n\r\nThe tone of the show is so wildly fickle it boggles the mind.  One minute, you\u2019re watching gargantuan alien monsters rip some unfortunate teenage girl to shreds in a very explicit manner, and the next, you\u2019re watching two verified ice queens pout at each other in their government-issued swimsuits over which one of them gets to play house with Handsome Jock Pilot.  Cryska\u2019s hammer-and-sickle bikini is truly one of the silliest things I\u2019ve ever seen onscreen.  The show starts out in the realm of bloody total war in an edgy sci fi universe based in alternative history, but after a few episodes of knocking out some of the kinks in the back story (and installing dozens of new ones), the show remembers that, ultimately, somewhere down the line, deep in the murky depths of its past, it comes from a romance-based visual novel.  I just love seeing characters flirting over secure military channels meant for important communications before and after a pitched, deadly battle.  Yuuya accumulates a harem as the narrative bulldozes onwards, naturally, as one does, and there IS a hot springs episode, in case you were worried that was more original than it appears to be.  It\u2019s impossible to gauge just how silly this show wants to be, how silly it is prepared to be, and how silly it really should be.\\n\\n\r\nI do think that Total Eclipse needs to reign in its dark side, since the show simply isn\u2019t equipped to handle content of a certain level of maturity, but the show\u2019s major weakness isn\u2019t purely an inconsistent tone; the show tries to do too many things in too little time.  The show has a lot of ideas it tries to expound on and a lot of plot threads it tries to follow, but it simply doesn\u2019t have the time for everything; some of the questions raised are too big to address in the time allotted.  One arc gets abandoned to make room for another before its resolution; plots initiate and peter out with little warning and never come to fruition.  The show always has to move on to the next thing, which means that none of the characters, themes, conflicts, or stories become fully developed, and the show tries to make up for lost time by inflating the humor and exacerbating the violence.  The combat and more serious arcs turn gruesome and heavy-handed enough to come off as dumb and edgy, the light-hearted and romance-centered arcs fall back on stereotypes and get ridiculous, and the stuff in between falls short of going anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nI refuse to believe that in the middle of a planet-wide war for the very existence of humanity itself the UN (which still exists and is in charge of the situation?) would shell out to send its most experienced test pilots and valuable support staff to a tropical paradise for a leisurely vacation/bikini photoshoot, even if it IS for \u201cmorale-building purposes.\u201d  And not the morale of the test pilots, mind \u2013 the morale of the other military/general UN personnel who purchase the resulting photographic evidence of said swimsuit competition.  Seems a bit far-fetched under normal circumstances, but when Eurasia is dominated by massive, hostile alien hordes and the last vestiges of organized human resistance are reeling on the brink of defeat, it seems downright ludicrous and irresponsible.  That\u2019s without mentioning how uncomfortable and creepy it is for the UN to repeatedly exploit its distinguished female officers for various lecherous purposes.  Speaking realistically, the show just wants its fair share of fan service, but the in-universe justifications don\u2019t sit right.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation doesn\u2019t seem expressive enough to capture the emotions intended to show through, and the setup for each scene bungles the atmosphere perfectly.  I often felt that characters were oddly placed in the shots and the visual composition of the scenes never allowed the show to take full advantage of the situations it was supposed to be harvesting for emotions \u2013 to say nothing of the fact that learning to like or care about any of the characters onscreen was a lengthy, arduous process only made possible by the sheer length of time I spent with them (24 episodes can be one heck of a long time).  The animation, aside from being appended to a horribly unappealing style of art, suffers from a lack of fluidity and a number of poor decisions in spacing, framing, or execution that make some scenes laugh-inducing, including a few that definitely shouldn\u2019t be comedic.  Characters\u2019 motions sometimes don\u2019t gel with their vocalizations \u2013 not in terms of actual audio-visual synchronization, but in terms of the expressions or actions simply not being animated dramatically or subtly enough to convey the feelings demanded by the performance, dialogue, or circumstances.  The animation isn\u2019t terribly consistent and though it manages to avoid being downright ugly most of the time I could never couch calling this a good-looking show.  The TSFs and BETA are computer-generated and stand out from the two dimensions of everything else, but while their movements are much cleaner, the fight choreography generally leaves something to be desired, and I\u2019m not a big fan of their designs.  In fact, while the TSFs are usually passable, I found the BETA horrendously ugly and could hardly stand to watch them.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all look like plastic, and their personalities and animations follow suit.  Nobody has real conversations; every other line is some pointed accusation followed by a grave repartee and a series of teeth clenching, shocked gasps, and dramatic head turns as the combatants try to determine who has the biggest chip on their shoulder.  The constant drama becomes wearisome.  Despite the fact that a homicidal alien swarm has apparently conquered and devastated a vast portion of Earth and left humanity\u2019s greatest nations struggling to stay their inevitable annihilation, most of the show centers around political drama (those darn Soviets) or standard harem hijinks (because interplanetary war can never defeat the flame of love, or, more accurately, the flame of it\u2019s not like it\u2019s love or anything).  Half the giant robot fights are simulated battles between training units that ultimately don\u2019t amount to anything except more excuses for the pilots to get huffy with each other in the bars.  \\n\\n\r\nAt the very least, the show begins to pick up in the second half and starts throwing out new ideas for story lines that could be engaging.  As I mentioned earlier, none of them reach a conclusion and they look silly in retrospect for their abortive meanderings, but I have to credit the show for having some good ideas in the first place.  For example, Yuuya Bridges is a Japanese-American pilot who struggles with his liminal status in society and his sense of self-worth as a result of his mixed heritage, for which he faces discrimination.  He comes into conflict with Yui, who regards him as an American and reminds him of everything he has learned to hate about the Japanese, and his Japanese-American former wingmate, who deals with the pressures differently.  Over time, Yuuya undergoes coherent changes as he learns his way around accepting his heritage and his role in life, and while he still isn\u2019t a brilliantly written character, watching Yuuya deal with racial issues you don\u2019t find too frequently in anime is somewhat rewarding.  Similar threads of racial tension and class conflict surface throughout the show under various guises.  As I said previously, I don\u2019t believe that Total Eclipse has the space or the smarts to adequately address such weighty issues, even for a main character, but at least it tries, and that\u2019s worth something.\\n\\n\r\nWorth noting is that this show delivered the first Georgian and Kazakh anime characters I\u2019ve ever seen, and likely the last.  They were all assholes.  I could probably say the same for a lot of other nationalities, but I\u2019d really rather not.  While we\u2019re in that same realm, I don\u2019t believe I have ever been more bothered by a large cast of characters all speaking the same language.  Given the vast number of nationalities represented in the show, communication must at least be extremely burdensome to accomplish fluidly and at most utterly impossible.  Fine, the Georgians and the Russians can speak Russian to each other, the Japanese and the Japanese-Americans can speak Japanese to each other, and it stands to reason that some number of characters must speak English as a second or third language, but suggesting that a large cast representing a vast portion of Europe, Asia, and the Americas can joke, trade insults, issue commands, argue, banter, read reports, attend lectures, flirt, and perform drills and training exercises in the same language with all the poise and subtlety of native speakers stretches the bounds of plausibility slightly more than an invasion of murderous video game aliens from Mars.  Even if all of these individuals have a strong enough grasp of one common language (probably English, unless the UN officially adopted Esperanto in this alternate timeline) to communicate functionally with each other, how can they all speak with such ease and fluidity as to receive orders, make snap decisions, and navigate life-or-death situations on the battlefield in a foreign language?  That sounds like a recipe for disaster.  What genius cobbled together a squad comprising Japanese-American, Italian, Swedish, and Nepalese members under the command of Japanese and Turkish officers with a heavily international support staff, working alongside units from Russia, China, and America, among other places?  It is truly a miracle that anything gets done around here.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is clunky and dim-witted.  The scene transitions are awkward and hurried.  The main characters are all prickly, arrogant, testy, and frustrating, while the side characters are one-note punchlines or space-fillers; their designs are forgettable and about as unlikable as the personalities they are attached to.  Nearly all of their interactions, in any context, feel stilted and unrealistic.  The \u201cplot\u201d switches gears at the drop of a hat and, for all the backstory and gratuitous gore crammed into the first few episodes, doesn\u2019t seem to have any real bearing on the universe it takes place in (these are the TEST pilots, keep in mind; if they ever see combat, it\u2019s an accident).  The action sequences are underwhelming and the animation of the BETA is off-putting.  The soundtrack, while actually pretty decent, is often overbearing and too frequently recycled.  Were I the kind of person to drop shows, I would have been very tempted to do so early on.  I wouldn\u2019t write off the show as a complete wash, however.\\n\\n\r\nOn rare occasions, Total Eclipse does manage to hit the mark and deliver something that\u2019s emotional without being melodramatic and just as significant as it should be.  You\u2019ll have to dig for these moments, but they are there.  Perhaps this has something to do with the length of time it took me to carve my way through the show, as familiarity makes us more forgiving, but eventually Total Eclipse won me over with its incurable stupidity.  I began to feel concern for the characters when they found themselves in danger and intrigued by the admittedly realistic way the show portrays international relations in the midst of interplanetary war.  Total Eclipse manages to perform poorly in areas where plenty of other terrible shows/films don\u2019t even think to screw up, but it is endearingly dumb; it is, to borrow some of its own stellar dialogue, \u201cextremely fine.\u201d\\n",

            "content": "Humans have made contact with aliens while exploring planet Mars. Now Earth is fighting a losing war against them who they now called the \"BETA\". The war is going so badly that even new trainees are being sent straight to the battlefield before completing their training. Yui Takamura, daughter of a renown family, is the last survivor from her team. Three years later, still haunted by the cruel demise of her friends she reaches the rank of liutenant and leads a team of test pilots as part of the UN Pacific Force's Project XFJ, an initiative for developing the Japanese Imperial weaponry further so thatthey can get an edge on their alien enemies. Like Yui, the test pilots are comprised of those who lost their home and loved ones to the BETA. Amongst them is rash American born Yuuya Bridges who isn't proud of his half Japanese roots and so can't see eye-to-eye with the native Yui. Yet somehow, they must set aside their differences.\\n\\n\r\nThe show starts gets off to quite a rough start. First two episodes felt like a quick crash course on the plot because the direction felt really rushed. Fight scenes were too quick and you didn't really have any time to warm up to Yui's friends to get a sense of her despair other than the gorey scenes. However, the pacing is much better afterwards. Less rushed fighting scenes and more focus on character development.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the first two episodes, the art and character design is generally good. BETA alien designs don't look that impressive and the 3D models style stand out too much from the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nYour cast of characters are your cliche Anime personalities but as usual, the clash between them makes them fun to watch. There's a fair amount of fan service during the first half of the show such as scenes showing girls changing into and wearing tight body suits, abundant shower scenes etc which might put some people off. It gets pretty silly as usual with all the girls falling for the same guy. There's even your cliche stuck on a desert island scenario. It's based on a dating sim so I guess you kind of expect it - it's a prequel set 11 years before the events of Muv Luv Alternative.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the story doesn't get on too badly afterwards as we watch the characters grow through a lot of internal conflict amongst the remaining human population. There's suddenly no more fan service scenes either (well... maybe another episode's worth of your obligatory hot springs). Unfortunately the BETA don't get much focus in the show so they kind of feel like an after thought loosely put together. It doesn't wrap-up that great either and feels more like a teaser to go buy the game or read the light novels.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not quite as funny but it does kind of remind me of Full Metal Panic. If you don't mind the heavy fan service aimed at the male audience during the first couple of episodes and some brief gore it's probably worth a watch.",
