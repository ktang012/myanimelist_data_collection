            "content": "\"At the end of the day, at the end of the day when all was for naught, I can at least take pleasure in knowing that my little sister is waiting at home with open arms and a warm bosom.\" \u2014 Sophocles\r\nSince the Armory Show of 1913, the state of Western Civilization has been one of decline. Though the rise of Modernist Art might not seem terribly significant to the average uneducated reader, the paradigm shift from Representational Art to Abstract Art planted the Seeds of Degeneracy that sprouted into the base and rotten Popular \"Culture\" that we are all so familiar with today. Indeed,with shameless and vile works like Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey standing proudly at the vanguard of a modern Literary Movement that panders and coddles its audience, Western Literature has never been in more dire a state. What happened to authors who challenged their readers like real writers do? Where is the bravery? What happened to Subversive Literature like Great Expectations, a veritable seven-part Landmark Masterwork by David Copperfield about an orphan who goes to a secluded school that straddles the edge between \"magic\" and \"reality\"? And this horrible trend of dumbed-down throw-away culture is not limited to the realm of Literature (if horrible books like Twilight can even be called as such). We no longer have true artists like Fragonard whose shockingly honest and realistic depictions of the harsh reality of daily life were barred from the Paris Salon of 1863. But where the West has fallen, the East will rise, and today I am going to talk about the work that will undoubtedly serve as the herald of the most important Literary Movement of the new millennium: the Japanese animated television series \"As Long as There's Love, It Doesn't Matter If He is My Brother, Right?\"\\n\\n\r\nThere is a genre of writing called Allegorical Fiction. Considered by the vast majority of Rational and Moral Enlightenment thinkers to be the Highest form of Literature, the great Dutch librettist Voltaire famously said, \"Give me not a story about a man who does deeds, but one where the man becomes the deeds.\" However, it is not nearly as accessible as a conventional linear narrative with wish-fulfillment elements like Fifty Shades of Grey and as it is very rare to find a work of Allegorical Fiction these days, it is an exceptionally rare treat to be fortunate enough to experience one. As such, we should be very thankful that the underground Japanese Literary Movement known as \"Imoutocore\" is giving us the opportunity to once again experience works from this all-but-forgotten genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe heart of Imoutocore is Family Values. Yes, these are the same Family Values that have been so savaged abandoned by the vulgar abomination that is Western Popular Culture, and it is a miracle that a small group of Japanese writers were somehow able to remember these vaunted Family Values after almost an entire century of Western Degeneracy. As Saint Thomas Aquinas so eloquently proclaimed on his deathbed, \"As men there is much for which we should be thankful, but above all things, it is not the opportunity to know God for which I am most thankful, but the opportunity to know the bosom of my little sister.\" Thus, as Aquinas was one of the discoverers of Western Morality, we can infer that the central tenet of Family Values is the ability for one to love one's little sister.\\n\\n\r\nThough the seminal Japanese light novel (\"light\" is short for \"en-light-enment\") \"My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute\" (Oreimo for short) is arguably the founding work of the Imoutocore Movement, the animated television adaptation of the light novel \"As Long as There's Love, It Doesn't Matter If He is My Brother, Right?\" (OniAi for short) will undoubtedly be remembered as the most important for both its deep and meaningful narrative and the sublime art and animation that was wrought from the hands of the maestros of Studio FUNimation. The crux of the story is what the early 20th century (aka. Pre-Degeneracy) Russian philosopher Edsger Dijkstra called \"The Teapot of False Choice.\" Although Akito is living in the same house as his rightfully beloved little sister, he is surrounded by temptation in the form of other women. However, as this a work of Allegorical Fiction, the reader is not to think of them as \"real\" women. Instead, one is best served to think of each as a False Choice that together compose the metaphysical structure that Dijkstra termed \"The Spout of Deontology.\" As for Akito, although it is tempting to think of him as some sort of Reader Avatar of sorts, he is what translators have varying called \"The Cap of Moral Righteousness\" or just \"The Cap of Justice.\" When the Cap of Justice is in place, the only way for tea to escape the teapot is by following the Path of False Choices on the Spout of Deontology. Or in layman's terms, Akiko is best girl and a perfect miracle of the universe and MC is an ignoble gentleman for ignoring her and consorting with other females.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Visual Art is the most corrupted aspect of contemporary Western Civilization\u2014recall that the Seeds of Degeneracy were planted by Modernist Artists in the first place\u2014the Japanese arthouse film collective Studio FUNimation was able to shed the weight of one hundred years of Degenerate Art and produce what can objectively be called nothing less than a feast for the eyes. Drawn in the style of Socialist Realism that was favoured by Russian masters like Lu Xun and Ai Weiwei, a complete mastery of the female anatomical form is not only demonstrated in the art of \"As Long as There's Love, It Doesn't Matter If He is My Brother, Right?\" but employed as a key element of its unique style of visual storytelling. Indeed, even the Greeks were not fully confident in their mastery of the human form and frequently used lewd distractions like exposed genitalia in order to distract viewers from anatomical imperfections. Furthermore, they, nor any culture that followed were skillful enough to use the female form in such a bold way as the Siscons (the term that Imoutocore artists use to refer to themselves) do in this work. Boldly bringing new meaning to the term \"False Choice,\" Akito's temptation is profoundly palatable in each and every scene where the talented artists of Studio FUNimation grace the screen with their powerful depictions of the components of The Spout of Deontology.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I started this review with a quote from the great Roman tragedian Sophocles is simple: \"As Long as There's Love, It Doesn't Matter If He is My Brother, Right?\" is a tragedy. In the end, Akito is unable to make the right choice, is unable to love his little sister, and is unable to uphold Family Values within his household. The ending of this story is perhaps the very saddest in Literature, as the heart of any viewer should wrench during the highly emotional climax and somber aftermath. And after everything, when we realize that his little sister will never truly know the love of her older brother, we also realize that just as Akito is doomed, Western Civilization is as well. But as the Korean sociologist Watari Wataru added to the end of one of his treatises recently, \"My wife might have left me and I didn't get tenure, but goddamn am I glad that OniAi is getting a second season.\"",

            "content": "Tsundere Right? Follow me. I don't like you one bit. Not at all\r\nReply: I don't see you as a love interest one bit. Not at all.\r\nThat wasn't Tsundere!\r\nEvery anime has its own priorities, or goals. If every anime was aiming for the same thing then there would be little variety. Shounen anime like one piece or naruto are meant to make the watchers enjoy awesome fights and power ups through a long adventure and Key productions such as Clannad and Angel beats are meant to be a romance story that could make a grown man cry.\r\nOniAi(this anime) does not aim for a romance or action.Comedy is the only goal. If you expect a plot or a goal then this is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nOniAi is an anime aiming to be a romantic comedy. Do not let the word romance fool you. It uses romance as comedy, there is no actual romance development.\\n\\n\r\nOK. After all I have said it may sound I am a huge critic who hates this show. Not at all. In fact, I love it. It does its job splendidly making me smile and laugh so much throughout an episode I need to calm down because my face hurts due to smiling ( I am doing so as of now ). \\n\\n\r\nStory-9\\n\r\nThe story is the little sister trying to win her brother's heart (kind of... the methods are... strange). It is hilarious with all the obstacles and events she has to overcome and how she gets past them. \\n\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nThe art is very nice, colorful and fits with the mood of happiness and laughter. The pictures bring out the best of each characters. However I have a tiny problem with the eyepatch which reminds me of evil pirates so it's an 8.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nThe sound is very well done and the characters voices could give you a good idea of what is going on, even if you don't understand ( trust me I tried ). The sound blends well with the show and amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\r\nThis is perhaps my favorite part of the show. The characters are all unique, though quite unrealistic and symbolizing a strange trait or characteristic their interactions are simply hilarious. I also love how the characters react to different situations and their strange attract to Akito ( the main character ). Best of all there is no stupid male perv that ruins moments by acting stupid stupid stupid. The introduction of new characters is equally enjoyable as you get to see new characters representing something you may like or would of liked to see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nA smile is much easier to make than a frown is so false. It usually takes a ton to make me laugh out loud. However, if it takes a ton to make me laugh out loud then this show would be like a trillion tons of comedy and happiness. I laugh at every moment and it does not make me sad, angry or depressed at all. This is pretty much laughing gas compressed and packed in an anime. Super duper enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to smile, laugh, have fun. Or just take a break from your stressful life, watch this. If you are simply looking for a story with a great plot or something this won't have it. I would consider this a masterpiece at what is does, which is comedy however I really do not expect much of a story. If you have seen one of those harems where the indecisive male lead gets nothing accomplished, expect it. However, this is not due to indecisiveness but to the uniqueness of the situation and how the anime would actually lower in grade due to plot. The comedy would greatly reduce if anything was actually accomplished and the unstable situation is what causes the laughter and happiness to overflow (kind of like how unstable ions can make explosions or something). \\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely a good watch for having fun. Try it! (if you read books it's kind of life Dr.Seuss books vs the Hunger Games or Harry Potter except this anime is wayyyyy funnier)",

            "content": "Guilty pleasures...things you know are bad but like them regardless. This show would have to be one of my biggest guilty pleasures of 2012. So generic, so predictable, yet funny and entertaining at the same time. \r\nOnii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne, or OniAi, is yet another fan service heavy romance anime. An incestuous tale about about a high-school girl who, after six long years, finally gets to see her beloved brother. After some random unexplained developments, the story develops into a harem in just the first episode. \r\nFrom there, the plot becomes extremely predictable to the point of just being plain sad.A mere copy and paste of every other bland romantic comedy. As if having one of those every season now isn't bad enough. At least add some twists to it like Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru did.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just as predictable. You have your normal guy main character who just wants a quiet life. Then you have your cast of horny, hot, and cute girls. All of which fall into generic anime stereotypes. Examples? Well you have your brother complex little sister, childhood friend, rich blond girl, and mature/seductive girl. I can't say they were not funny though. It is always amusing to watch anime chicks do crazy things for the one they love. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much i can say for the sound, except that i think the voice actors did a good job. They portrayed the cute cast of girls very well. The opening song and its suggestive scenes were pretty good too. Not to mention it was very erotic.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the artwork in OniAi. Silver Link and their bright animations always gave me a pleasant feeling inside. The backgrounds were colorful, and the characters looked very attractive.\\n\\n\r\nOniAi severely lacks in originality and effort to keep the viewers interested. Fan service and cliche jokes were the only thing that kept me watching. Honestly, that was all it took. Boobs and lame jokes had me watching this all the way to episode twelve. Sometimes, that is all it takes to make an anime enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOniAi was an OK anime overall. Like i said in the beginning, this is a guilty pleasure. There are obviously many faults with it, but that does not mean you should completely condemn this series without giving it a shot.  Lower your expectations and bit, and enjoy it for what it is.",

            "content": "*sniff sniff* I smell Harem!\r\nStory:\r\nOnii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne tells the story of how Akito and Akiko, two twins separated at birth, are finally reunited after 6 years. The two of them live together in an old dorm with three other females and the five of them make up the student council of their school. Now this seems all fine and dandy except for one problem though: while Akito seems pretty normal, his sister developed this very, VERY serious brother complex. Combine this with the fact that the other three girls are attracted to Akito in some way shape or form andyou\u2019ve got yourself a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nRomantic Comedies (especially harems) are tricky due to idea of unoriginality and stereotypes. I\u2019m not going to lie to you, ALL the characters are stereotypes. Despite that, I so far find the series enjoyable in how they execute their humor. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAkito- The male protagonist and object of affection of the girls around him. Aside from being the landlord, he is also the student counsel's \"vice-assistant of proxy of secretary\". A pretty normal high schooler who wants to lead a peaceful life. (Note: something VERY interesting gets discovered about him at the beginning of episode 2)\\n\\n\r\nAkiko- Akito's sister and the secretary of the student counsel. She is constantly (and i mean CONSTANTLY) trying to seduce her brother despite his refusals and obvious uninterest. She even comes up with all these clich\u00e9 setups for her brother to follow since they live together. She doesn\u2019t even try to hind it and is in fact proud of it.\\n\\n\r\nAnastasia or Ana for short (youll get the joke after the first episode)- is the vice-president of the student council and the rich, stoic expression wearing stereotype. Because of her background, she can\u2019t do chores like cleaning and cooking but she can say the most ridicules things with a straight face.\\n\\n\r\nGinbee- the accountant of the student counsel and Akito's childhood friend. She looks and sounds rather boyish and seems forever friend zoned by Akito\\n\\n\r\nArashi- the president of the student council. She has red hair, an eye patch, and caries around a wooden sword (nothing stereotypical about that). She seems like the cougar of the group\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe artwork seems very bright and colorful to fit the upbeatness of the story. My only complaint is that everyones mouth looks like a triangle\\n\\n\r\nOP-ED:\\n\r\nAlthough I didnt enjoy the music for the opening OR ending, it did seem catchy so it might grow on you. The VISUALS for the OP, however, could not make me stop laughing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nOne stereotype the series DOESN'T follow is how the main character responds to the girls advances. In fact, it\u2019s HOW he responds that attributes too much of the comedy in the series. While Akito seems as normal as they come, the way he flat out DENIES the advances of the girls around him develops a good dose of humor. If you enjoy a good comedy with a simple plot then give this show a try. If your turned off by incest, stereotypes, and harems, then look away.",

            "content": "What i like most about this show just overall is it breaks conventions. It treads boldly on the taboo subject of a incestuous relationship. For once it broke the general cliche half siblings so its ok to love each other story line, in this they really go for it in blood related sibling relationship. I don't have a particular interest in that Genre of plot but i respect the fact they are boldly going somewhere new with the plot.\r\nThe story is very episodic in nature and only really continues the plot in that it develops the relationships of all the characters. There is no realantagonist or conflict so far which is kinda interesting for once. It splits up the episodes pretty evenly among all the characters and gives us a little more of them each time we see them. It is a harem style anime so its very perverted in nature with lots of adult themed jokes and such. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this show all together are a lot more bold with whats happening. You have dead pan and mono toned girls saying blunt and indecent statements and you have very high strung characters displaying obsession quite openly. With a abundance of sexual innuendo and tension it becomes very amusing. Each character is different in pretty much every way and they may not exactly be a new concept they are a lot more unique than first glance. I liked the fact the perverted character in this show isn't the brother, its all the girls in the show that are always trying to seduce him. \\n\\n\r\nThis show just seems very comfortable with itself and is not trying to go out of its way to conform to every other generic harem plot line and character. It delivers adult humor with such a casual demeanor that i cant help but be amused by it. It could be even more adventurous with its plots and overall story but its doing great for what it is and i would like it if a few other shows took notes about how to get outside the box.\\n\\n\r\nSome people may disagree with me but i think its the little things in this anime that make it worth watching. If your a fan of more adult humor and like cute slice of life styled atmosphere you may really enjoy this. I can understand people with a extreme moral fiber may be put off completely by the idea of a incestuous relationship or the amount of suggestive content but for a general audience i think they may appreciate it.",

This is a perfect example a bunch of girls that love the main guy as well as live in the same dorm as he does and they mess with him all the time but that is because they love him. This is the point of this series is sheer ecchi harem comedy, it doesn't deliver anything else.\r\nSo while many people may not find this reassuring I found it refreshing as to how they compete against each other for the protagonist's attention.\r\nIf by any chance you arelooking for something to cheer you up and ecchi harem comedies are your type then this series is waiting for you.",

            "content": "(Before you plan to absolutely downvote this review & start saying something against this anime because of 9 points I gave it,please read this review first,thank you:D)\r\n(*Comedy+\r\nbrocon-\r\nLikeness meter=?*)\r\nEcchi anime have been quite popular lately.Every season,there are 2-4 ecchi manga+novels which get an adaptation.Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai Yo Ne(Yup,this is its full name:O)is one of those highly ecchi anime which get an adaptation & become quite popular among a certain group of people.\r\nThis is a hit or miss kind of anime.Its wonderful if you watch it for its comedy & characters(Which are lovable) &  overly-disgusting if you get offended by the bro-con.So watchit if you can bear implemented FALSE bro-con & are a big comedy lover & also if u like to see harem anime.Don't watch it if you are only going to say,\"How disgusting it is...there is bro-con\" without even completing it first(as there is a TWIST) so with this introduction,lets begin:D\\n\\n\r\nStory:-(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe story,huh..I guess it is about a sister wanting to marry with her brother or what if I say it is about a bunch of high-schoolers living in the same building,two of them being brother where the brother has full harem(ofcourse,including the sister).Either way,story is not this anime's strong point.\\n\\n\r\nWe have Akiko,who loves her brother,Akito in a romantic way.She has been separated from her brother for quite a long period of time.Now finally she is able to stay at his place for completing her high school studies & is overjoyed because of it as she may now be able to spend much more time but suddenly her plans get ruined when the student council presiden,Arashi,Vice president,Anastasia(Ana for short) & Accountant,Ginbei also come to stay there.So it is about her STRUGGLE on dealing with them & still getting her brother to love her..huh...\\n\\n\r\nFor me,this is a cliche but a nice story but It is easily one of the best comedic harem anime I have ever seen.You will get some good laughs,some great laughs & some loud laughs till you get tired of having them:)\\n\\n\r\nArt:-(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nAbout 95 percent of this anime is spent in the building in which our main cast lives(just like in seitokai no ichizon)The remaining 5 percent is spent in school(mainly in student council) & there are some rare scenes outside plus at Akito's part time job as a incest novelist(yeah incest..)I\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of this,this anime has done a great job in art department.All the girls are just beautifully drawn & are Moe-kyun worthy=).I just love Ana & Akiko's expressions.Akiko for numerous faces she makes & Ana for that...straight face.\\n\\n\r\nI think it is a bit unique too in this department since I have not seen these kind of character designs before so it is different..Its colorful,vibrant plus animation is fluid which is a plus for anyone.\\n\\n\r\nSound:-(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song..............is soo soooooo goood.I just adore it.I could listen it for hours & still not be bored.I don't think so there has been a single episode in which I didn't hear it AT LEAST twice.This is one of those reasons,I love this anime.The ending song...is the opposite of opening song.I don't feel anything for it.It is just okay..Bgm is also nice.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-actors have done a great job(I really mean it)Their could not be a better choice for each character's respective voice actor.Akiko's voice actor has done that cute voice which her character demands.I can't believe it is her debut,She sounds so professional.Ana's voice actor has done the same which goes well with her straight face.Ginbei's boyish voice & Arashi's aggressiveness goes well with her respective seiyuu's voice.\\n\\n\r\nSo,this anime is great even in sound department.Voice-acting & opening songs is a big plus.I am cutting 1 point because of its ending song as it is a disappointment:(\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:-(10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOh my God,this anime has some lovable characters.Totally one of the strongest points of this series.Each character has a unique personality although some are explained more & others less which is a bit disappointing as it is a lovable series but all of them are great.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all,Akito is a pretty nice protagonist.I actually like him.For once,there is a good protagonist in an harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nAkiko has those cute expressions & that ever-echoing laugh in my ears\"Guhehehe,guhe\"I don't know how much I love that.Her aggressiveness is also notable.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to aggressiveness,no one can beat Arashi.She is really a storm(Arashi means Storm:D).She wears an eye-patch which is attractive,I guess.\\n\\n\r\nGinbei has those boyish features & she is actually childhood friend of Akito due to which she believes that she will be forever in the friends zone with him..\\n\\n\r\nFinally Ana,the silent queen.She is just so charming with that straight face & is usually  calm but when that wall of calmness is broken,a totally new Ana appears who is so cute as well.Her name is a joke as well(see the series for more information...)\\n\\n\r\nThere are also some side-characters.Arisa who is fiancee(I just love this word) of Akito due to SOME circumstances.A young loli who is a genius & can do anything from cooking to ...all other things.Jinno is Akito's editor & has a misunderstanding about Akito as she thinks that he is a sis-con AND a loli-con....\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is just intriguing when it comes to characters.I just love each & everyone of them but my favorite is still Akiko.2nd is ofcourse Ana.\\n\\n\r\nSo,10/10 for this:D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:-(10/10)/(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is amazingly done.Too bad it ended with a unexpected twist.\\n\r\nI just love,no...adore it.That comedy & of course Akiko's laugh,I am going to miss so much.Guhehehehe.I love how the preview is done.A really good anime for me.\\n\\n\r\nSo my last advice is that do not watch this anime if you can not handle..again..FALSE bro-con(as I call it) & if you are a comedy lover(like me),want some great anime with outstanding characters & don't mind lack of action,story then I strongly suggest it.So I hope you will watch this anime & my review will be able to attract you to this anime.Don't watch it if you are just going to leave it incomplete forever in your list....\\n\\n\r\nSo I guess this is time to....answer my own question which is in the beginning of this review.\\n\\n\r\nComedy+\\n\r\nCharacter+\\n\r\nLikeness meter=Full!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"I love you Onii-chan!\"\r\n\"No, we cant, we related by blood\"\r\nMaybe thats two sentence was almost appear in every episode of this anime, and from that sentences we can presume that this anime was about brocon, what is brocon? Brocon is when your little sister is falling in love with your big brother.seems weird heh? but i dont think so.\r\nas far as we can see, when we thinks about brocon or even siscon anime, we're gonna like \"Uhhhh, thats disgusting, i hate it\" or maybe \"thats broke the law of nature!\" oh okay, relax. On my perspective on watching anime, i always thought do not ratedthe anime if we havent finished the series yet, and thats why i thought this anime WAS UNDERRATED.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, this story was simple, its about Akiko Himenokouji that loves his brother Himenokouji Akito, yeah, you can said Akiko has a serious brocon complex,  and the problem is that his brother is didnt accept his love except he loves her as just as his sister. thats reasonable for me, not only that, more problem was waiting for her since all member in dormitory was in love too with Akito, and of course they are competing to get Akito attention. so basically, this was a harem anime which add some brocon in the story. simple. Furthermore, i found the joke really hit the spot, as for me, it was funny. it doesnt exaggerating and even imposing the jokes, so the jokes itself was flowing naturally.\\n\\n\r\nLike other harem anime, we can presume that this anime will lack of character,  hmm... i dont really think so. Every character in this anime has their own story why she was falling in love with the Akito. and thats make sense and sounds reasonable for me why they fallin in love with him. and more, what makes me think this harem anime was special is, there was a flashback for some character. i think, its rare to see the flashback for the character in harem, especially harem will always feature the fanservice and pantsu event of course. Honestly, this anime has a lot of fanservice too, but the fanservice itself is related with the story and again not too exaggerate it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, i cant said too much on this, but what i love from this was the coloring. it was beautiful and each character is well made. and more, i love the smile from each girl, its so cute, like K-on character. i thinks that a plus for  the smile, since silver link really know how to make a character looks more cuter.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the sound, i find this was amazingly good. they (the seiyuu) really embedded the feelings into the character and its very well made. moreover, the seiyuu for Akiko is a newcomer, but she performs like a pro seiyuu. especially the laughter from Akiko is really unique, they made their own (KUHEHEHE~), same as the famous sound \"Tutturu~\" from Mayuri, steins;gate. and as for the OP, it was good too. it really fits with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the conclusion was, as we know, this anime mainpoint was comedy, so i thought the purpose was to entertain the viewer, and as for me, they had completed that purpose, i had fun watching this anime. and furthermore, i thought why this anime was score so low, well, each people have their own perspective about what anime they likes, and for me, i found this anime was UNDERRATED. and once again, dont judge this anime if you havent watched all the series, your perspective about this anime is brocon will vanished.",

            "content": "Well now there are many ways to approach this anime review. I could review it based solely on the anime or I could compare it to the light novel and inform you what was lost in the \u201ctranslation\u201d. For the sake of giving the anime a fair shot, I will score it based only on the anime itself but I will be injecting notes on what the anime could have done better in comparison to the light novel.\r\nSo the anime does a pretty piss poor job of explaining what is going on and keeping your feelings invested towards the characters. The plot is essentially areuniting of Akito and his sister Akiko after a long separation. They end up living in the same house along with the student council at their high school and the usually boy x girl events happen. The anime unfortunately comes across as a generic harem while the light novel feels more like a serious drama. The anime has all the typical harem scenes that we have experienced in the past; the shower scene, the mall scene, etc. I hate to say it but the anime really looks and feels as if it was put together very half-hazardly and was trying to ride on the success of the light novel. Please understand that this is NOT a faithful adaptation of the light novel.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is somewhat a mixed bag; it looks great in some scenes but the overall quality is somewhat lower than what I would expect from a 2012 anime. The characters are visually appealing but the show lacks a certain visual aspect that sets itself apart from all the other anime. This lighting is not done very well, you see many instances where proportions do not really match up, ext. The animation just comes off as generic for eighty percent of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming quality for this anime in the sound department are the voice actors\u2019 performances. Each character\u2019s voice actor did a superb job injecting their feelings into their characters. Anastasia has a cold, monotone personality that is expressed well by her voice actor. Even the annoying but too cute Akiko\u2019s voice actor did an amazing job making Akiko a loved and disliked character. Other than the voice acting though the anime falls pretty low on the bar as far as sound goes. The background music is forgettable and generic but the intro and ending songs are quite catchy.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of this anime work very well with each other even if most of them are forgettable. Akito, Akiko and Anastasia were for me the stars of the show. Akito\u2019s strong will and intellect, Akiko\u2019s annoying but super cute personality, and Anastasia\u2019s cold and cool attitude created so many funny and unique scenes throughout the entire anime. My personal favorite character was Anastasia because even though her personality withheld most of her true feelings from everyone else, it was easy to always tell what was on her mind. Also her interactions with Akito were the most fun to watch. The other characters however were either boring or just not appealing. I especially found Arashi just out of place and a bother to the whole chemistry of the group. The young house leader was also quite annoying and off putting. Overall the main three characters really helps make the show shine but a couple others bring it back down.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime adaptation of Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne (what a mouthful) is just generic. After reading some of the light novel a couple months before the airing of the anime, I was very excited to see the brother sister romance issue unfold with the student council. What unfortunately occurred here was taking a great drama with very thought provoking and witty conversations and turning it into another generic and barely passable harem anime. I advise that you steer clear from the anime and just read the light novel. It is much better than the anime and it will have you craving for more.",

            "content": "Oh wow, I have to admit, I never expected to enjoy this anime so much! \r\nThis series' full name is 'Onii-Chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai Yo Ne!' Oh how is loosely translates in English, 'It Doesn't Matter If He's My Big Brother, As Long As I Love Him, Right?'  This anime was adapted from the light novel series of the same name written by Daisuke Suzuki and the artwork was by Gekka Uruu. Now the author has written another light novel series before writing this one which was also made into an anime. \u201cGoshuushou-Sama Ninomiya-Kun\u201d And like this series, that one is alsoan ecchi harem series but it doesn't have the incestuous love element that this series has. I haven't seen Goshuushou-Sama Ninomiya-Kun but if it's anything like this series then I'm sure I'll enjoy it! \\n\\n\r\nTo tell the truth, I've only read the first 3 of the 8 light novels that are out but those are the only ones I could find with an english translation, and even then, I was going to try my hand at reading the original Japanese novels but I couldn't find them anywhere online so I just had to settle for the first three novels to learn from. I've also read the manga adaption but once again, I didn't have much to read since there were only 5 chapters out online. \\n\\n\r\nNow I feel like I have to warn you right now if you want to check out this anime that it's rated 16+ it's got plenty of ecchi moments and there are scenes were characters get completely naked but there's censorship around the really naughty bits. And if you're really close-minded and absolutely hate the idea of an incestuous relationship, then I don't suggest watching this. \\n\\n\r\nStory- The plot for this anime is pretty simple. These incest-related light novel series seem to have plots like this. But even though the plot is pretty simple, that doesn't stop this from being an enjoyable romantic comedy anime. Through the whole anime, nothing much really happens, it's just comedy for comedy's sake with a bunch of fanservice thrown in. But for what it's worth, the plot may be simple but if you're into comedy anime or slice of life anime, or even enjoy a good harem anime series then you're going to enjoy this.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The animation work on this anime was done by Silver Link, they are best known for animating the \u201cBaka To Test' anime, and I have to admit, I really like the way they animated this series. One point that I really liked was that the eyelashes were colored to match the character's hair colors, which I think is a little unrealistic but it does bring a nice bit of depth to the character's eyes and made them really pop to me. I also loved the little bit of shine that they added to the character's skin, even though that's a common trait to find in ecchi anime like this. \\n\\n\r\nSound- The opening theme for this anime is called \u201cSelf-Producer\u201d and it's sung by Minori Chihara, who is the voice of Anastasia Natsuhara. And I just love how much energy is in this song! And considering that there isn't a full English translation here online yet, I'm going to be working on translating it into English the best that I can even though I'm not 100% fluent in Japanese. And the ending theme song is called \u201cLife Ru Is Love Ru\u201d and this is sung by the female cast of the show, the main 4 female characters sing this ending song. And once again, this song is just full of energy and is just addicting to me and I can't get enough of it! The voice cast are all pretty well known in the anime community and they all did a wonderful job with voicing the characters for this anime! I found no faults with them here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- All of the characters in this anime are all vibrant and interesting to say the least, these characters all have their own quirks that make you love them, and I had no issues with any of them, which is rare since I tend to find an issue with every any character I find in an anime like this but not this one and I commend the author for creating such wonderful characters! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- This anime had a lot of good moments, moments that made me go 'aww' or made me laugh, this anime was very enjoyable to me and I was looking forward to each episode. And one of the quirks about the episodes is that we see focus on pretty much every character and no one is left out, which i find rather hard to balance with harem series like this with more then one female lead but this was executed really nicely, the jokes were all funny and the ecchi moments weren't too over the top either. Overall, I enjoyed the anime through and through and didn't get bored at all and was thoroughly entertained!\\n\\n\r\nOverall- I would recommend this anime for anyone who loves the slice of life genre like I do, or anyone who loves comedy or fan service or even ecchi anime like this, but like before if you don't like incest or don't like ecchi and are very close-minded then I wouldn't advise this anime, but if you can get past those little details then you'll find a very funny and enjoyable anime out of OniAi! I would especially recommend this to anyone who loves the romantic comedy genre of anime.

            "content": "I'll start off by saying that i dropped this anime at episode 4...but I do have a pretty good understanding of the story. At least as much as you can get in 4 episodes.\r\nStory-4\r\n-----------\r\nThe summary of the show didn't particularly draw me in, but I do find ecchi shows to be funny and enjoyable, and the incest love thing was at first thought sickening to me, but then I decided to look past that and just enjoy it. That just became impossible because of how boring the show is though. I found episode 1 to be the most interesting and it got boring fast startingat 2 and by 4 I just couldn't stand it anymore.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt-6\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe art is probably the best thing about this show, and that's not saying much. It's bland and typical. I'm mostly referring to the characters of course because everything else is just meh.\\n\\n\r\nSound-6\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nThe OP/EDs of the show are enjoyable, but not anything I would download and listen to in my free time. The voice actors are good, but it's sad they got put on a show like this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-1\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are the show, and they're not the best.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-3\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nI got some enjoyment out of the show, for the weird take on a harem, but it was just not a show I could bring myself to finish or miss.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall-5\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nThis show could have been something interesting. Instead, the only thing i'm taking away is Japan has no limits to where they are willing to go, perverted wise. That's what makes a lot of anime great, but it's the only thing that makes this anime exist and it just isn't enough.",

            "content": "Hi! Another Robert's Too Late Review coming to assault your eyes! This time we're going to be looking over Oniichan dakedo Ai sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne. The first point of note is good lord could they not come up with a shorter name??? Guess not. In all honesty I came across the title as being something similar to Kissxsis, and not believing anything *not* hentai could be like that title, I started the first episode with a somewhat cynical eye. I mean, I have no problems with taboo subjects, I did thumbs up Yosuga no Sora after all, but I didn't expect much fromthis 'Oni ai' or what have you. I absolutely did not imagine it would be in consideration for a spot on the RTLR wall of indecency! \\n\\n\r\nBut not half way in, I knew I had to see this series, and I can say I honestly had a blast watching it. There are reasons why the review scores aren't higher than a statement like that would seem to warrant and we'll get into it, but by and large let me assure you this is *not* like Kissxsis or even Yosuga no Sora. This is much more odd-paired humor with ecchi touches joined to a story about a guy who will do ANYTHING to avoid committing incest with his sister, or even avoid the appearance of impropriety. In doing so, hijinks ensue! \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThe premise is somewhat interesting, I will leave the synopsis to explain the finer details of that. The issue I have with the story premise is the 'why' of it all. Why do the siblings have to live in an old dorm? Why does the 3 other Student Council members (and an eventual 4 girl) have to live in there as well? No explanation is really given, not one that has a whit of impact or meaning at the very least. It's just 'they are living together in a dorm, without proper adult supervision, because well they just are, and if you don't like it, we can take it outside' at which point I reassured the show that I wasn't judging it and offered to buy the next round of drinks. Of course the Council members are all girls, and attractive in their own ways. Not a guy to be found, other than our lucky (unlucky?) main, who has to not only fend off his perverted sister, but the rest of the babes as well. \\n\\n\r\nOf course the main is a gentleman, of course avoiding incest (as I'd like to think we ALL would) but he also doesn't enter into a romantic relationship with any of the girls in the dorm with him. He even has an opening (not guaranteed like the dorm girls, but a chance I think) to hook up with his adult publisher boss, and he even passes on that. I know from experience there is an anime for nearly any taste out there, sometimes I think I'd like to see one like this where the guy jumps on the busty president or takes the athletic best friend to bed and then deals with the drama around having a sexual relationship with one (or more) of the housemates. I imagine something like that is out there, I just haven't browsed the proper places. But anyway, the guy is surrounded by these beautiful girls (and his sex obsessed sister) and in his attempt to keep pure a number of hijinks occur, as the girls launch plan after plan to nab him. This provides most of the entertainment for the show, of how the poor guy is going to avoid the man-eating girls around him.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned the whole issue of explaining why they were in that situation to start with, well there's another few knocks that can be rightfully rapped against the title. One of them being the 'who' of the household. Yes it's the Student Council, but there's a glaring problem with the blonde vice president. She's the daughter of a hugely rich industrial tycoon, and is so out of touch with real life she doesn't know how to unpack, and even spends a couple of episodes without underwear, not only because she doesn't know how to do laundry, but its shown that she doesn't know how to even put *anything* away. She just drops things where she is when she's done with them, and is basically non-functioning. How would a super rich girl who clearly has lived her whole life with servants end up alone in an 'old' (as often pointed out) dorm with no one to help her? She's there because she's deadpan, out of touch with real life, and a good fulcrum for a lot of the jokes, that's why. That's really part of the biggest complaint I have, many things are the way they are purely because the show says so, and again it'll kick your ass if you don't like it. \\n\\n\r\nThey don't bother to explain anything that doesn't fit the whimsical or helps set up a joke/ecchi scene. This lowers the score for me on a lot of levels because in moments between funny scenes I couldn't help but ask why the situation even existed. But that also is part of the appeal of the show, there aren't many moments where we have time for such questions. The jokes flow quickly and the wackiness rarely lets up. You don't have time to wonder why the huge breasted president has an eye patch when she's doing everything in her power to expose said breasts to the guy in an attempt to seduce him. The rapid fire jokes, ecchiness, and silliness leave little room for serious consideration on why things are the way they are. \\n\\n\r\nBut there is enough time for those thoughts to surface here and there, so the lower score, even though I openly admit enjoying the show. Humor is good, but sometimes a tiny bit of logic really makes a difference. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI found the anime to have good art, I really like the styling they used to draw the eyes, the girls are all detailed for the most part, and their personality is evident through the art. There are playful visual gags and jokes which I found humorous, and overall the art flows well. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI loved the opening and ending songs, they are silly, light and fun. The odd thing about the opening was that at times the show would be literally half over before they would spin the song. Not something I've seen before. The voices are all well done. The main guy has a voice I'd classify as 'normal' which in a lot of these ecchi type shows can be unusual, as the guys often sound like dolts or other variations of idiots. This guy sounded intelligent enough and was articulate. The girls had great voices for the most part. The 'sister's voice was slightly shrill and loud, but considering she's demanding an incestuous relationship, she should sound like that, I believe. The busty president always confident and eager, the rich girl has an awesomely creepy monotone, and the sporty (and likely closest to 'normal' girl) has a bright voice. Everyone sounds great, and the music is fun. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe characters are fun, but somewhat over the top, and the show would not have suffered if they would have dialed some of it back. To start the main guy is really normal, and not a slobbering idiot, which as I said in an ecchi is always a plus, but for some reason they make him a part time writer. Not only does he attend high school, but he also writes romance novels on the side. Of course he doesn't write normal romance, he writes, surprise surprise, incest novels. Why a guy who literally has to fend off his sister's CONSTANT sexual advances would write such seems nothing more to me than a less than funny joke. I can get down with silly humor, but that's just cliche to the point it hurts. Also, it seems that he is made to be a part time writer purely to bring in yet another woman, his adult managing editor, who, under the guise of making sure he's not actually committing incest, becomes a short term member of the harem. She doesn't seem to have much other use, and his writing career seems to be there to facilitate yet another woman to lust after him. \\n\\n\r\nThe president is very sexually aggressive, though not as much as the incest obsessed sister, but pretty close. She uses her huge breasts and physical maturity to intimidate the other girls out of trying for the main, but also to attempt to seduce him as well, as one might expect. The problem becomes that EVERYTHING for her becomes part of her sexual aggression. She's mentioned to be bisexual once or twice, which is not a thing, but she uses the same '(wo)maneater' mentality about everything, and it gets a little predictable by the end. She's still fun, just kind of one note, something a lot of the girls suffer from. \\n\\n\r\nThe vice president, the rich monotone blonde seems to alternate between wanting to bed the main and being sexually attracted to first the 'sporty' girl, who has a slight build, and later when the last member arrives, a very young girl, she becomes the blonde's target. So I guess the rich girl swaps between the main and being a bit of a pedophile. This is a bit on the creepy side, clearly. We already have the whole incest vibe to deal with, we could go without also having one cast member being turned on by a 12 year old. The blonde also has a joke she repeats nearly every episode of the show it seems. It's related to her name, and it would take longer to explain than it does to tell the joke, so I'll pass on the details. Just know that it was slightly groan inducing the second time, and annoying as hell by the 10th. \\n\\n\r\nThe sporty girl is a very long time friend of the main, and would by my estimation have the most 'rights' to have a crush on him, but she is overshadowed by the rest of the cast. She isn't odd in the sense of having an outrageous feature like the other girls, but that makes her get lost in the cast very easily. Her issue is that she's in high school, and yet has small breasts and isn't stacked like the president or the other girls. That's first a normal thing for some girls to worry about which doesn't seem to fit this over the top anime, and secondly it doesn't stand out nearly as much as being a sexual predator or being obsessed with incest or being a closet bisexual that prefers her girls to have child-like builds (if not be actual children). So sporty gets lost in the shuffle pretty easily. \\n\\n\r\nIncest sister's issues are kind of apparent, she will do nearly anything to 'cross the line' with her brother. She hides in his futon, forces him to bathe with her and the girls, you name it. While this  could be considered the crux of the humor of the show, it depends on your viewpoint. Either you find it hilarious that she's so very determined, or you'll be weary by her endless antics. Of course if you find yourself wearied at her beating that dead horse, then this isn't the show for you. But I would note that there are moments you do want to tell sister to just give it a rest. \\n\\n\r\nThe final member of the harem appears several episodes in, and is a 12 year old girl as I mentioned in the rich girl's section. Not only does the young girl have to fend off rich girl, she speaks of herself in third person. Robert has no love in his heart for those that speak in third person! (har har)\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of these character flaws, they do all come together and balance out better than it would seem. It's not high art, nor is it the top of comedy, but its still a good time. I just want to make sure that I don't forget the shortcomings, and I'm known to do. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI laughed out loud at this anime several times. I did enjoy myself, but in a silly, 'I can't believe they did that' kind of way. It wasn't something that took very much thought, but it also wasn't something that appealed only to the lowest denominator (which is VERY easy to do with ecchi) and it didn't throw nudity around purely for attention. It isn't highbrow by any means, but it could have been much more childish. It was, well, a seven of ten. Not a waste of time, and being only a 12 episode series, short enough to be tolerable, and not so long as to really wear out its welcome. Its one of those series you just have to take what they give you, i.e. the setup, certain other things at face value and not ask questions, and just roll with the jokes as they come. If you don't try to deconstruct it, and overthink it, it can be a pretty good time. I wouldn't say big thumbs up, but I do recommend watching if you want to laugh at a fairly silly show. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the great RTLR wall of peer review, the group as a whole scored a spot for one reason: the end. Pay attention to the last 20 seconds or so of the show, as one hell of a kicker is dropped that made the show even funnier, in my opinion.",

Let's talk about this anime, a cringeworthy, so predictable, trashy and unfunny anime. Yes, I'm honestly saying that I almost hated this anime, thinking it was just a funny anime with an incest background like Oreimo, but I was expecting too much.\r\nOk, first of all, let's start with the story. (there will be possibly spoilers of the first episode only)\r\nWe have this girl, Himenokoji Akito, that after years of not seeing his brother, Himenokoji Akito, she finally reunite with him. They livetogheter under the same roof, they go to the same school together, shit like that, ok. But the fun fact is that Akiko, the sister, has an incestuous complex with her brother. But her brother doesn't care anymore, he's just, y'know, she loves her as a sister, she must protect her, bla bla bla. So yeah, we have this anime, with this annoying girl that this Akiko is, trying to flirting her brother, to have sex with him/marry him, in short, I N C E S T. And also in the first episode, we also have OTHER AMAZING CHARACTERS! EXACTLY, A HAREM WITH OTHER 3 GIRLS (and not only) TIPS FROM NOTHING.\\n\\n\r\nI gave to the story a 3, because y'know it's just a simple slice of life anime (one of my favourites genres in anime to be honest), but it's filled with so many ecchi scenes (yep, those ecchi anime scenes that I don't see since Sora no Otoshimono, that it's actually better), so many things I didn't understand because the anime didn't explain it very well - expecially the fucking ending, that made me fucking cry for anger, BECAUSE IT'S SO STUPID - and also, the main thing: it's not funny, for me at least. I literally felt embarassed every minute, in every scene I saw. I actually laugh in anime like this, but this anime didn't make laugh at all. It's so ridicolous, predictable, and already seen.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art I gave it a 7 because honestly, they did a pretty good job. Nothing else to say.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, yea, the opening is fine (nah) and I didn't listen to the ending because who fucking cares (at least for me for this anime).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, aaah, the characters. So predictable, unfunny, cringeworthy, stupid, and so on.\\n\r\nLet's see what we have.. hmmm..\\n\r\nThe little and cute sister, a crazy and autistic girl to be honest. She didn't see his brother since long time and she went just crazy. Literally, C R A Z Y.\\n\r\nThe stupid fucking brother, a light novel writer, and guess what? (spoilers, probably, don't read these words) He writes incestuous light novels, based on his real sister and him. Oh god.\\n\r\nThe apathetical tsundere.\\n\r\nThe.. pirate? Samurai? Girl with an eye patch? I don't fucking know, probably she's autistic too.\\n\r\nThe childhood friend.\\n\r\nThe loli.\\n\r\nThe editor of the amazing Brother. (I don't know, I honestly liked only this character, It's neutral, beside these ones).\\n\\n\r\nI will let you imagine how I enjoyed watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I gave this anime a straight up 3. Didn't enjoy watching it. I actually do enjoy lots of anime I watch, with the most simple plots too, but this anime is an exception. If you wanna watch this anime for having just a few laughs (you won't) or at least wasting your time, do it, you'll lose all your precious time, when you can rather watch some good anime, with ok, a simple plot? But definitely better than this.\\n\\n\r\n*drops mic*\\n\\n",

First i though it's just like a normal daily life, but it turn out to be so much different than i have predicted.\r\nThe story is kind of irregular, there was no clear-conclusion where the plot will take us. It's more like a collection of short stories of what kind of life that Akito have.\r\nThe art is good, the color used is fit with the genre of the anime.\r\nThe sound, i love the voice actors! Each characters have their own unique method oftalking and their own unique accent (you'll know if you watch it), especially when Akiko make a \"guhehehe\" sounds, it's right to the spot. I don't really like the op and ed songs though.\\n\r\nThe characters, personally i just like Akiko, Anastasia, and Arashi. They have their unique characters and their designs is great too. For the other heroines, i think the personalities they inherit is too simple, so it really doesn't leave a mark.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime for those who love comedy, daily-life, harem, romance and ecchi.\\n\r\nThis anime is made for those who want to laugh, but please remind that there are so many dirty jokes among them. So for those who dislike ecchi stuff, it's better to not watch this. Not just the dirty jokes, there are also many fanservices in this anime so watch your back when you watch this! XD\\n\r\nThis anime focused more on the harem parts than the romance parts, so you'll found just a few doki-doki emotions from the heroines (many of them come from Anastasia which make her very cute).\\n\r\nThe easy daily-life with many comedy parts make this anime fun and no-tiring to watch. Altough the plot is unclear, the entertaintment is enough to make up for it.",

            "content": "This one is hard. Definitely a guilty pleasure.\r\nOverview:\r\nI came to this after reading the light novels it was based on. I won't say I loved the novels, I sometimes had to skip over the parts with Anna in them, but I admired their depictions of Akito as a very sound minded kind of guy. He's stuck in a very moe situation, I won't say harem, but very close to it, and unlike most harem heroes, he keeps his head about him. Very little really freaks this guy out. Three girls including his sister are coming onto him hard and he stays relatively cool and caneven be very charming and insightful. A lot of times his dialogue, just his ability to keep calm and say the right things to break up the moe and keep it real honestly impressed me at times. \\n\\n\r\nIt went so far I had to believe I was misreading the novels. After all it was a translation and it was just writing. Maybe the author intended that Akito was really screaming these lines. Could he really be this cool? I seriously doubted it. And I want to thank this anime, because without it, I would never have been sure just how cool the character of Akito could be. As it turns out, he was everything I dreamed he was and more. I love this character and his depiction in the anime, I have to say pretty much borders on perfect.\\n\\n\r\nNow is when I should probably bring up that the disgust generated by this anime caused the people who were working tirelessly translating the light novels to drop them completely.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem I think is that the studio was looking for a harem anime to capitalize on Oreimo's success and well, the novels just weren't quite moe enough. I can't help going into some detail on the changes they made, I'm sorry. If you want the short version, they messed it up both in big ways - really freaking huge ways - and in small subtle ways as well.\\n\\n\r\nPremise:\\n\r\nThe story starts just after Akito has spirited his twin sister Akiko away in the night from the estate of her adopted parents to the run down old fashioned shack of a house he rented because he's a freaking hero and he can't help it. Only in this version he just kind off bought what looks like a mansion and waited there for her to come to him after shipping most of her stuff. \\n\\n\r\nOkay no more details. It's been seven years since Akito and Akiko were adopted and split up by rival families because their parents died and these rivals saw an opportunity to eliminate the opposition. Akito at that time swore to Akiko that one day they would be reunited. They would live under the same roof again, retake their family name, and no one would ever force them apart again. And seven year's later he's finally done it. \\n\\n\r\nOnly Akiko, reflecting for seven years on the words he spoke to her has come to believe that the two of them were desperately in love with eachother as children and his oath was a declaration of love and his intent to effectively marry his sister. And now the time has come and she is all for it. Akito's feelings can be summed up in his line, \"I love you more than anyone else in the world - as a sister.\"\\n\\n\r\nNow the anime jumps I don't know how many months ahead and has very little else to do with the novels from now on. Akito, Akiko and three other girls now all live together in this mansion as the four girls compete for Akito's affection. It has turned ito a full on harem fanservice anime and you only really have to watch the opening to get the picture. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI'm not going to explain all the characters for you, Ana and Arashi are mostly the same as they were in the book (that is to say, fanservice characters) only a whole hell of a lot less subtle about it. The anime also completely omits the family politics thing that kinda gave Ana and Asrashi a good reason to be here, so pretty much just fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nAkiko is fairly well depicted though they cut a lot of her best dialogue short. Akito is beautifully depicted, though he narrated the novels so of course a lot of his best stuff had to be cut out. But they actually added in a bunch of great dialogue for him so I won't complain\\n\\n\r\nIt's Ginbei that really gets my goat. In the novels, I loved Ginbei, especially her downright eloquent phone conversations with Akito. And in the anime we skip over all those phone conversations and she's a Tsundere. You will notice, Ginbei is not mentioned among the characters and voice actors above, and that is right. For me, there is no Ginbei in most of this series.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nStill, I have to say, there are a lot of good bits to this anime. The first episode, the beginning of the second episode. The flashback episode (Akito was already a goddamn hero when he was just ten years old). There a little snippet when Akito is sick that's definitely worth watching. It's just great to see some of these scenes depicted on screen. They do take certain scenes from the novels and throw them around here and there without screwing up the dialogue too much and those scenes are genuinely pretty good. Even some of the added scenes, like Psudo-Ginbei's moe shtick with the kitten, are pretty darn decent. This is one of those animes which are honestly painful for me to watch from beginning to end, but now that I've finished watching it, I go back to it all the time just to watch an episode or a scene that I just can't get out of my head. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know if I can recommend it. I give it a four because I think maybe four tenths of the series are worth watching and re-watching. iIf you're not cool with incest, there isn't any but you'll probably want to skip this anyway. If you like incest romances at all, go read the novels, or at least the volumes that were translated and if you like those, go ahead and watch the series.",

The incest factors of the anime were a little off putting and being unaware of what Ecchi was at the time some scenes came as a pleasant surprise. In the end I did end up enjoying the anime though and recently picked it backed up and enjoyed it just as much a second time.\r\n Like most SOL anime the series starts out like it has a plot but doesn't reallytake it anywhere. Most episodes just consist of the girls competing to try and win over Akito and others are them going out and having fun with each other. I myself don't need to have a strong plot in every anime I watch so personally I found all the episodes to be enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\n The art is very pleasant to look at with bright colors and detailed backgrounds. The sound track was also a great part of the anime with catchy upbeat music and I don't think I skipped over the intro once while watching the series.\\n\\n\r\n If you're wondering if you should watch this series I would definitely recommend it.

            "content": "\"At the end of the day, at the end of the day when all was for naught, I can at least take pleasure in knowing that my little sister is waiting at home with open arms and a warm bosom.\" \u2014 Sophocles\r\nSince the Armory Show of 1913, the state of Western Civilization has been one of decline. Though the rise of Modernist Art might not seem terribly significant to the average uneducated reader, the paradigm shift from Representational Art to Abstract Art planted the Seeds of Degeneracy that sprouted into the base and rotten Popular \"Culture\" that we are all so familiar with today. Indeed,with shameless and vile works like Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey standing proudly at the vanguard of a modern Literary Movement that panders and coddles its audience, Western Literature has never been in more dire a state. What happened to authors who challenged their readers like real writers do? Where is the bravery? What happened to Subversive Literature like Great Expectations, a veritable seven-part Landmark Masterwork by David Copperfield about an orphan who goes to a secluded school that straddles the edge between \"magic\" and \"reality\"? And this horrible trend of dumbed-down throw-away culture is not limited to the realm of Literature (if horrible books like Twilight can even be called as such). We no longer have true artists like Fragonard whose shockingly honest and realistic depictions of the harsh reality of daily life were barred from the Paris Salon of 1863. But where the West has fallen, the East will rise, and today I am going to talk about the work that will undoubtedly serve as the herald of the most important Literary Movement of the new millennium: the Japanese animated television series \"As Long as There's Love, It Doesn't Matter If He is My Brother, Right?\"\\n\\n\r\nThere is a genre of writing called Allegorical Fiction. Considered by the vast majority of Rational and Moral Enlightenment thinkers to be the Highest form of Literature, the great Dutch librettist Voltaire famously said, \"Give me not a story about a man who does deeds, but one where the man becomes the deeds.\" However, it is not nearly as accessible as a conventional linear narrative with wish-fulfillment elements like Fifty Shades of Grey and as it is very rare to find a work of Allegorical Fiction these days, it is an exceptionally rare treat to be fortunate enough to experience one. As such, we should be very thankful that the underground Japanese Literary Movement known as \"Imoutocore\" is giving us the opportunity to once again experience works from this all-but-forgotten genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe heart of Imoutocore is Family Values. Yes, these are the same Family Values that have been so savaged abandoned by the vulgar abomination that is Western Popular Culture, and it is a miracle that a small group of Japanese writers were somehow able to remember these vaunted Family Values after almost an entire century of Western Degeneracy. As Saint Thomas Aquinas so eloquently proclaimed on his deathbed, \"As men there is much for which we should be thankful, but above all things, it is not the opportunity to know God for which I am most thankful, but the opportunity to know the bosom of my little sister.\" Thus, as Aquinas was one of the discoverers of Western Morality, we can infer that the central tenet of Family Values is the ability for one to love one's little sister.\\n\\n\r\nThough the seminal Japanese light novel (\"light\" is short for \"en-light-enment\") \"My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute\" (Oreimo for short) is arguably the founding work of the Imoutocore Movement, the animated television adaptation of the light novel \"As Long as There's Love, It Doesn't Matter If He is My Brother, Right?\" (OniAi for short) will undoubtedly be remembered as the most important for both its deep and meaningful narrative and the sublime art and animation that was wrought from the hands of the maestros of Studio FUNimation. The crux of the story is what the early 20th century (aka. Pre-Degeneracy) Russian philosopher Edsger Dijkstra called \"The Teapot of False Choice.\" Although Akito is living in the same house as his rightfully beloved little sister, he is surrounded by temptation in the form of other women. However, as this a work of Allegorical Fiction, the reader is not to think of them as \"real\" women. Instead, one is best served to think of each as a False Choice that together compose the metaphysical structure that Dijkstra termed \"The Spout of Deontology.\" As for Akito, although it is tempting to think of him as some sort of Reader Avatar of sorts, he is what translators have varying called \"The Cap of Moral Righteousness\" or just \"The Cap of Justice.\" When the Cap of Justice is in place, the only way for tea to escape the teapot is by following the Path of False Choices on the Spout of Deontology. Or in layman's terms, Akiko is best girl and a perfect miracle of the universe and MC is an ignoble gentleman for ignoring her and consorting with other females.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough Visual Art is the most corrupted aspect of contemporary Western Civilization\u2014recall that the Seeds of Degeneracy were planted by Modernist Artists in the first place\u2014the Japanese arthouse film collective Studio FUNimation was able to shed the weight of one hundred years of Degenerate Art and produce what can objectively be called nothing less than a feast for the eyes. Drawn in the style of Socialist Realism that was favoured by Russian masters like Lu Xun and Ai Weiwei, a complete mastery of the female anatomical form is not only demonstrated in the art of \"As Long as There's Love, It Doesn't Matter If He is My Brother, Right?\" but employed as a key element of its unique style of visual storytelling. Indeed, even the Greeks were not fully confident in their mastery of the human form and frequently used lewd distractions like exposed genitalia in order to distract viewers from anatomical imperfections. Furthermore, they, nor any culture that followed were skillful enough to use the female form in such a bold way as the Siscons (the term that Imoutocore artists use to refer to themselves) do in this work. Boldly bringing new meaning to the term \"False Choice,\" Akito's temptation is profoundly palatable in each and every scene where the talented artists of Studio FUNimation grace the screen with their powerful depictions of the components of The Spout of Deontology.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I started this review with a quote from the great Roman tragedian Sophocles is simple: \"As Long as There's Love, It Doesn't Matter If He is My Brother, Right?\" is a tragedy. In the end, Akito is unable to make the right choice, is unable to love his little sister, and is unable to uphold Family Values within his household. The ending of this story is perhaps the very saddest in Literature, as the heart of any viewer should wrench during the highly emotional climax and somber aftermath. And after everything, when we realize that his little sister will never truly know the love of her older brother, we also realize that just as Akito is doomed, Western Civilization is as well. But as the Korean sociologist Watari Wataru added to the end of one of his treatises recently, \"My wife might have left me and I didn't get tenure, but goddamn am I glad that OniAi is getting a second season.\"",

Not at all.\r\nThat wasn't Tsundere!\r\nEvery anime has its own priorities, or goals. If every anime was aiming for the same thing then there would be little variety. Shounen anime like one piece or naruto are meant to make the watchers enjoy awesome fights and power ups through a long adventure and Key productions such as Clannad and Angel beats are meant to be a romance story that could make a grown man cry.\r\nOniAi(this anime) does not aim for a romance or action.Comedy is the only goal. If you expect a plot or a goal then this is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nOniAi is an anime aiming to be a romantic comedy. Do not let the word romance fool you. It uses romance as comedy, there is no actual romance development.\\n\\n\r\nOK. After all I have said it may sound I am a huge critic who hates this show. Not at all. In fact, I love it. It does its job splendidly making me smile and laugh so much throughout an episode I need to calm down because my face hurts due to smiling ( I am doing so as of now ). \\n\\n\r\nStory-9\\n\r\nThe story is the little sister trying to win her brother's heart (kind of... the methods are... strange). It is hilarious with all the obstacles and events she has to overcome and how she gets past them. \\n\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nThe art is very nice, colorful and fits with the mood of happiness and laughter. The pictures bring out the best of each characters. However I have a tiny problem with the eyepatch which reminds me of evil pirates so it's an 8.\\n\\n\r\nSound-9\\n\r\nThe sound is very well done and the characters voices could give you a good idea of what is going on, even if you don't understand ( trust me I tried ). The sound blends well with the show and amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10\\n\r\nThis is perhaps my favorite part of the show. The characters are all unique, though quite unrealistic and symbolizing a strange trait or characteristic their interactions are simply hilarious. I also love how the characters react to different situations and their strange attract to Akito ( the main character ). Best of all there is no stupid male perv that ruins moments by acting stupid stupid stupid. The introduction of new characters is equally enjoyable as you get to see new characters representing something you may like or would of liked to see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\r\nA smile is much easier to make than a frown is so false. It usually takes a ton to make me laugh out loud. However, if it takes a ton to make me laugh out loud then this show would be like a trillion tons of comedy and happiness. I laugh at every moment and it does not make me sad, angry or depressed at all. This is pretty much laughing gas compressed and packed in an anime. Super duper enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to smile, laugh, have fun. Or just take a break from your stressful life, watch this. If you are simply looking for a story with a great plot or something this won't have it. I would consider this a masterpiece at what is does, which is comedy however I really do not expect much of a story. If you have seen one of those harems where the indecisive male lead gets nothing accomplished, expect it. However, this is not due to indecisiveness but to the uniqueness of the situation and how the anime would actually lower in grade due to plot. The comedy would greatly reduce if anything was actually accomplished and the unstable situation is what causes the laughter and happiness to overflow (kind of like how unstable ions can make explosions or something). \\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely a good watch for having fun. Try it! (if you read books it's kind of life Dr.Seuss books vs the Hunger Games or Harry Potter except this anime is wayyyyy funnier)",

            "content": "Guilty pleasures...things you know are bad but like them regardless. This show would have to be one of my biggest guilty pleasures of 2012. So generic, so predictable, yet funny and entertaining at the same time. \r\nOnii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne, or OniAi, is yet another fan service heavy romance anime. An incestuous tale about about a high-school girl who, after six long years, finally gets to see her beloved brother. After some random unexplained developments, the story develops into a harem in just the first episode. \r\nFrom there, the plot becomes extremely predictable to the point of just being plain sad.A mere copy and paste of every other bland romantic comedy. As if having one of those every season now isn't bad enough. At least add some twists to it like Kono Naka ni Hitori, Imouto ga Iru did.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just as predictable. You have your normal guy main character who just wants a quiet life. Then you have your cast of horny, hot, and cute girls. All of which fall into generic anime stereotypes. Examples? Well you have your brother complex little sister, childhood friend, rich blond girl, and mature/seductive girl. I can't say they were not funny though. It is always amusing to watch anime chicks do crazy things for the one they love. \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much i can say for the sound, except that i think the voice actors did a good job. They portrayed the cute cast of girls very well. The opening song and its suggestive scenes were pretty good too. Not to mention it was very erotic.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the artwork in OniAi. Silver Link and their bright animations always gave me a pleasant feeling inside. The backgrounds were colorful, and the characters looked very attractive.\\n\\n\r\nOniAi severely lacks in originality and effort to keep the viewers interested. Fan service and cliche jokes were the only thing that kept me watching. Honestly, that was all it took. Boobs and lame jokes had me watching this all the way to episode twelve. Sometimes, that is all it takes to make an anime enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOniAi was an OK anime overall. Like i said in the beginning, this is a guilty pleasure. There are obviously many faults with it, but that does not mean you should completely condemn this series without giving it a shot.  Lower your expectations and bit, and enjoy it for what it is.",

            "content": "*sniff sniff* I smell Harem!\r\nStory:\r\nOnii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne tells the story of how Akito and Akiko, two twins separated at birth, are finally reunited after 6 years. The two of them live together in an old dorm with three other females and the five of them make up the student council of their school. Now this seems all fine and dandy except for one problem though: while Akito seems pretty normal, his sister developed this very, VERY serious brother complex. Combine this with the fact that the other three girls are attracted to Akito in some way shape or form andyou\u2019ve got yourself a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nRomantic Comedies (especially harems) are tricky due to idea of unoriginality and stereotypes. I\u2019m not going to lie to you, ALL the characters are stereotypes. Despite that, I so far find the series enjoyable in how they execute their humor. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAkito- The male protagonist and object of affection of the girls around him. Aside from being the landlord, he is also the student counsel's \"vice-assistant of proxy of secretary\". A pretty normal high schooler who wants to lead a peaceful life. (Note: something VERY interesting gets discovered about him at the beginning of episode 2)\\n\\n\r\nAkiko- Akito's sister and the secretary of the student counsel. She is constantly (and i mean CONSTANTLY) trying to seduce her brother despite his refusals and obvious uninterest. She even comes up with all these clich\u00e9 setups for her brother to follow since they live together. She doesn\u2019t even try to hind it and is in fact proud of it.\\n\\n\r\nAnastasia or Ana for short (youll get the joke after the first episode)- is the vice-president of the student council and the rich, stoic expression wearing stereotype. Because of her background, she can\u2019t do chores like cleaning and cooking but she can say the most ridicules things with a straight face.\\n\\n\r\nGinbee- the accountant of the student counsel and Akito's childhood friend. She looks and sounds rather boyish and seems forever friend zoned by Akito\\n\\n\r\nArashi- the president of the student council. She has red hair, an eye patch, and caries around a wooden sword (nothing stereotypical about that). She seems like the cougar of the group\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe artwork seems very bright and colorful to fit the upbeatness of the story. My only complaint is that everyones mouth looks like a triangle\\n\\n\r\nOP-ED:\\n\r\nAlthough I didnt enjoy the music for the opening OR ending, it did seem catchy so it might grow on you. The VISUALS for the OP, however, could not make me stop laughing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nOne stereotype the series DOESN'T follow is how the main character responds to the girls advances. In fact, it\u2019s HOW he responds that attributes too much of the comedy in the series. While Akito seems as normal as they come, the way he flat out DENIES the advances of the girls around him develops a good dose of humor. If you enjoy a good comedy with a simple plot then give this show a try. If your turned off by incest, stereotypes, and harems, then look away.",

            "content": "What i like most about this show just overall is it breaks conventions. It treads boldly on the taboo subject of a incestuous relationship. For once it broke the general cliche half siblings so its ok to love each other story line, in this they really go for it in blood related sibling relationship. I don't have a particular interest in that Genre of plot but i respect the fact they are boldly going somewhere new with the plot.\r\nThe story is very episodic in nature and only really continues the plot in that it develops the relationships of all the characters. There is no realantagonist or conflict so far which is kinda interesting for once. It splits up the episodes pretty evenly among all the characters and gives us a little more of them each time we see them. It is a harem style anime so its very perverted in nature with lots of adult themed jokes and such. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this show all together are a lot more bold with whats happening. You have dead pan and mono toned girls saying blunt and indecent statements and you have very high strung characters displaying obsession quite openly. With a abundance of sexual innuendo and tension it becomes very amusing. Each character is different in pretty much every way and they may not exactly be a new concept they are a lot more unique than first glance. I liked the fact the perverted character in this show isn't the brother, its all the girls in the show that are always trying to seduce him. \\n\\n\r\nThis show just seems very comfortable with itself and is not trying to go out of its way to conform to every other generic harem plot line and character. It delivers adult humor with such a casual demeanor that i cant help but be amused by it. It could be even more adventurous with its plots and overall story but its doing great for what it is and i would like it if a few other shows took notes about how to get outside the box.\\n\\n\r\nSome people may disagree with me but i think its the little things in this anime that make it worth watching. If your a fan of more adult humor and like cute slice of life styled atmosphere you may really enjoy this. I can understand people with a extreme moral fiber may be put off completely by the idea of a incestuous relationship or the amount of suggestive content but for a general audience i think they may appreciate it.",

This is a perfect example a bunch of girls that love the main guy as well as live in the same dorm as he does and they mess with him all the time but that is because they love him. This is the point of this series is sheer ecchi harem comedy, it doesn't deliver anything else.\r\nSo while many people may not find this reassuring I found it refreshing as to how they compete against each other for the protagonist's attention.\r\nIf by any chance you arelooking for something to cheer you up and ecchi harem comedies are your type then this series is waiting for you.",

            "content": "(Before you plan to absolutely downvote this review & start saying something against this anime because of 9 points I gave it,please read this review first,thank you:D)\r\n(*Comedy+\r\nbrocon-\r\nLikeness meter=?*)\r\nEcchi anime have been quite popular lately.Every season,there are 2-4 ecchi manga+novels which get an adaptation.Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai Yo Ne(Yup,this is its full name:O)is one of those highly ecchi anime which get an adaptation & become quite popular among a certain group of people.\r\nThis is a hit or miss kind of anime.Its wonderful if you watch it for its comedy & characters(Which are lovable) &  overly-disgusting if you get offended by the bro-con.So watchit if you can bear implemented FALSE bro-con & are a big comedy lover & also if u like to see harem anime.Don't watch it if you are only going to say,\"How disgusting it is...there is bro-con\" without even completing it first(as there is a TWIST) so with this introduction,lets begin:D\\n\\n\r\nStory:-(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe story,huh..I guess it is about a sister wanting to marry with her brother or what if I say it is about a bunch of high-schoolers living in the same building,two of them being brother where the brother has full harem(ofcourse,including the sister).Either way,story is not this anime's strong point.\\n\\n\r\nWe have Akiko,who loves her brother,Akito in a romantic way.She has been separated from her brother for quite a long period of time.Now finally she is able to stay at his place for completing her high school studies & is overjoyed because of it as she may now be able to spend much more time but suddenly her plans get ruined when the student council presiden,Arashi,Vice president,Anastasia(Ana for short) & Accountant,Ginbei also come to stay there.So it is about her STRUGGLE on dealing with them & still getting her brother to love her..huh...\\n\\n\r\nFor me,this is a cliche but a nice story but It is easily one of the best comedic harem anime I have ever seen.You will get some good laughs,some great laughs & some loud laughs till you get tired of having them:)\\n\\n\r\nArt:-(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nAbout 95 percent of this anime is spent in the building in which our main cast lives(just like in seitokai no ichizon)The remaining 5 percent is spent in school(mainly in student council) & there are some rare scenes outside plus at Akito's part time job as a incest novelist(yeah incest..)I\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of this,this anime has done a great job in art department.All the girls are just beautifully drawn & are Moe-kyun worthy=).I just love Ana & Akiko's expressions.Akiko for numerous faces she makes & Ana for that...straight face.\\n\\n\r\nI think it is a bit unique too in this department since I have not seen these kind of character designs before so it is different..Its colorful,vibrant plus animation is fluid which is a plus for anyone.\\n\\n\r\nSound:-(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song..............is soo soooooo goood.I just adore it.I could listen it for hours & still not be bored.I don't think so there has been a single episode in which I didn't hear it AT LEAST twice.This is one of those reasons,I love this anime.The ending song...is the opposite of opening song.I don't feel anything for it.It is just okay..Bgm is also nice.\\n\\n\r\nVoice-actors have done a great job(I really mean it)Their could not be a better choice for each character's respective voice actor.Akiko's voice actor has done that cute voice which her character demands.I can't believe it is her debut,She sounds so professional.Ana's voice actor has done the same which goes well with her straight face.Ginbei's boyish voice & Arashi's aggressiveness goes well with her respective seiyuu's voice.\\n\\n\r\nSo,this anime is great even in sound department.Voice-acting & opening songs is a big plus.I am cutting 1 point because of its ending song as it is a disappointment:(\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:-(10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOh my God,this anime has some lovable characters.Totally one of the strongest points of this series.Each character has a unique personality although some are explained more & others less which is a bit disappointing as it is a lovable series but all of them are great.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all,Akito is a pretty nice protagonist.I actually like him.For once,there is a good protagonist in an harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nAkiko has those cute expressions & that ever-echoing laugh in my ears\"Guhehehe,guhe\"I don't know how much I love that.Her aggressiveness is also notable.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to aggressiveness,no one can beat Arashi.She is really a storm(Arashi means Storm:D).She wears an eye-patch which is attractive,I guess.\\n\\n\r\nGinbei has those boyish features & she is actually childhood friend of Akito due to which she believes that she will be forever in the friends zone with him..\\n\\n\r\nFinally Ana,the silent queen.She is just so charming with that straight face & is usually  calm but when that wall of calmness is broken,a totally new Ana appears who is so cute as well.Her name is a joke as well(see the series for more information...)\\n\\n\r\nThere are also some side-characters.Arisa who is fiancee(I just love this word) of Akito due to SOME circumstances.A young loli who is a genius & can do anything from cooking to ...all other things.Jinno is Akito's editor & has a misunderstanding about Akito as she thinks that he is a sis-con AND a loli-con....\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is just intriguing when it comes to characters.I just love each & everyone of them but my favorite is still Akiko.2nd is ofcourse Ana.\\n\\n\r\nSo,10/10 for this:D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:-(10/10)/(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is amazingly done.Too bad it ended with a unexpected twist.\\n\r\nI just love,no...adore it.That comedy & of course Akiko's laugh,I am going to miss so much.Guhehehehe.I love how the preview is done.A really good anime for me.\\n\\n\r\nSo my last advice is that do not watch this anime if you can not handle..again..FALSE bro-con(as I call it) & if you are a comedy lover(like me),want some great anime with outstanding characters & don't mind lack of action,story then I strongly suggest it.So I hope you will watch this anime & my review will be able to attract you to this anime.Don't watch it if you are just going to leave it incomplete forever in your list....\\n\\n\r\nSo I guess this is time to....answer my own question which is in the beginning of this review.\\n\\n\r\nComedy+\\n\r\nCharacter+\\n\r\nLikeness meter=Full!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

On my perspective on watching anime, i always thought do not ratedthe anime if we havent finished the series yet, and thats why i thought this anime WAS UNDERRATED.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, this story was simple, its about Akiko Himenokouji that loves his brother Himenokouji Akito, yeah, you can said Akiko has a serious brocon complex,  and the problem is that his brother is didnt accept his love except he loves her as just as his sister. thats reasonable for me, not only that, more problem was waiting for her since all member in dormitory was in love too with Akito, and of course they are competing to get Akito attention. so basically, this was a harem anime which add some brocon in the story. simple. Furthermore, i found the joke really hit the spot, as for me, it was funny. it doesnt exaggerating and even imposing the jokes, so the jokes itself was flowing naturally.\\n\\n\r\nLike other harem anime, we can presume that this anime will lack of character,  hmm... i dont really think so. Every character in this anime has their own story why she was falling in love with the Akito. and thats make sense and sounds reasonable for me why they fallin in love with him. and more, what makes me think this harem anime was special is, there was a flashback for some character. i think, its rare to see the flashback for the character in harem, especially harem will always feature the fanservice and pantsu event of course. Honestly, this anime has a lot of fanservice too, but the fanservice itself is related with the story and again not too exaggerate it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, i cant said too much on this, but what i love from this was the coloring. it was beautiful and each character is well made. and more, i love the smile from each girl, its so cute, like K-on character. i thinks that a plus for  the smile, since silver link really know how to make a character looks more cuter.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the sound, i find this was amazingly good. they (the seiyuu) really embedded the feelings into the character and its very well made. moreover, the seiyuu for Akiko is a newcomer, but she performs like a pro seiyuu. especially the laughter from Akiko is really unique, they made their own (KUHEHEHE~), same as the famous sound \"Tutturu~\" from Mayuri, steins;gate. and as for the OP, it was good too. it really fits with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the conclusion was, as we know, this anime mainpoint was comedy, so i thought the purpose was to entertain the viewer, and as for me, they had completed that purpose, i had fun watching this anime. and furthermore, i thought why this anime was score so low, well, each people have their own perspective about what anime they likes, and for me, i found this anime was UNDERRATED. and once again, dont judge this anime if you havent watched all the series, your perspective about this anime is brocon will vanished.",

            "content": "Well now there are many ways to approach this anime review. I could review it based solely on the anime or I could compare it to the light novel and inform you what was lost in the \u201ctranslation\u201d. For the sake of giving the anime a fair shot, I will score it based only on the anime itself but I will be injecting notes on what the anime could have done better in comparison to the light novel.\r\nSo the anime does a pretty piss poor job of explaining what is going on and keeping your feelings invested towards the characters. The plot is essentially areuniting of Akito and his sister Akiko after a long separation. They end up living in the same house along with the student council at their high school and the usually boy x girl events happen. The anime unfortunately comes across as a generic harem while the light novel feels more like a serious drama. The anime has all the typical harem scenes that we have experienced in the past; the shower scene, the mall scene, etc. I hate to say it but the anime really looks and feels as if it was put together very half-hazardly and was trying to ride on the success of the light novel. Please understand that this is NOT a faithful adaptation of the light novel.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is somewhat a mixed bag; it looks great in some scenes but the overall quality is somewhat lower than what I would expect from a 2012 anime. The characters are visually appealing but the show lacks a certain visual aspect that sets itself apart from all the other anime. This lighting is not done very well, you see many instances where proportions do not really match up, ext. The animation just comes off as generic for eighty percent of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming quality for this anime in the sound department are the voice actors\u2019 performances. Each character\u2019s voice actor did a superb job injecting their feelings into their characters. Anastasia has a cold, monotone personality that is expressed well by her voice actor. Even the annoying but too cute Akiko\u2019s voice actor did an amazing job making Akiko a loved and disliked character. Other than the voice acting though the anime falls pretty low on the bar as far as sound goes. The background music is forgettable and generic but the intro and ending songs are quite catchy.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of this anime work very well with each other even if most of them are forgettable. Akito, Akiko and Anastasia were for me the stars of the show. Akito\u2019s strong will and intellect, Akiko\u2019s annoying but super cute personality, and Anastasia\u2019s cold and cool attitude created so many funny and unique scenes throughout the entire anime. My personal favorite character was Anastasia because even though her personality withheld most of her true feelings from everyone else, it was easy to always tell what was on her mind. Also her interactions with Akito were the most fun to watch. The other characters however were either boring or just not appealing. I especially found Arashi just out of place and a bother to the whole chemistry of the group. The young house leader was also quite annoying and off putting. Overall the main three characters really helps make the show shine but a couple others bring it back down.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime adaptation of Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne (what a mouthful) is just generic. After reading some of the light novel a couple months before the airing of the anime, I was very excited to see the brother sister romance issue unfold with the student council. What unfortunately occurred here was taking a great drama with very thought provoking and witty conversations and turning it into another generic and barely passable harem anime. I advise that you steer clear from the anime and just read the light novel. It is much better than the anime and it will have you craving for more.",

            "content": "Oh wow, I have to admit, I never expected to enjoy this anime so much! \r\nThis series' full name is 'Onii-Chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai Yo Ne!' Oh how is loosely translates in English, 'It Doesn't Matter If He's My Big Brother, As Long As I Love Him, Right?'  This anime was adapted from the light novel series of the same name written by Daisuke Suzuki and the artwork was by Gekka Uruu. Now the author has written another light novel series before writing this one which was also made into an anime. \u201cGoshuushou-Sama Ninomiya-Kun\u201d And like this series, that one is alsoan ecchi harem series but it doesn't have the incestuous love element that this series has. I haven't seen Goshuushou-Sama Ninomiya-Kun but if it's anything like this series then I'm sure I'll enjoy it! \\n\\n\r\nTo tell the truth, I've only read the first 3 of the 8 light novels that are out but those are the only ones I could find with an english translation, and even then, I was going to try my hand at reading the original Japanese novels but I couldn't find them anywhere online so I just had to settle for the first three novels to learn from. I've also read the manga adaption but once again, I didn't have much to read since there were only 5 chapters out online. \\n\\n\r\nNow I feel like I have to warn you right now if you want to check out this anime that it's rated 16+ it's got plenty of ecchi moments and there are scenes were characters get completely naked but there's censorship around the really naughty bits. And if you're really close-minded and absolutely hate the idea of an incestuous relationship, then I don't suggest watching this. \\n\\n\r\nStory- The plot for this anime is pretty simple. These incest-related light novel series seem to have plots like this. But even though the plot is pretty simple, that doesn't stop this from being an enjoyable romantic comedy anime. Through the whole anime, nothing much really happens, it's just comedy for comedy's sake with a bunch of fanservice thrown in. But for what it's worth, the plot may be simple but if you're into comedy anime or slice of life anime, or even enjoy a good harem anime series then you're going to enjoy this.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The animation work on this anime was done by Silver Link, they are best known for animating the \u201cBaka To Test' anime, and I have to admit, I really like the way they animated this series. One point that I really liked was that the eyelashes were colored to match the character's hair colors, which I think is a little unrealistic but it does bring a nice bit of depth to the character's eyes and made them really pop to me. I also loved the little bit of shine that they added to the character's skin, even though that's a common trait to find in ecchi anime like this. \\n\\n\r\nSound- The opening theme for this anime is called \u201cSelf-Producer\u201d and it's sung by Minori Chihara, who is the voice of Anastasia Natsuhara. And I just love how much energy is in this song! And considering that there isn't a full English translation here online yet, I'm going to be working on translating it into English the best that I can even though I'm not 100% fluent in Japanese. And the ending theme song is called \u201cLife Ru Is Love Ru\u201d and this is sung by the female cast of the show, the main 4 female characters sing this ending song. And once again, this song is just full of energy and is just addicting to me and I can't get enough of it! The voice cast are all pretty well known in the anime community and they all did a wonderful job with voicing the characters for this anime! I found no faults with them here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- All of the characters in this anime are all vibrant and interesting to say the least, these characters all have their own quirks that make you love them, and I had no issues with any of them, which is rare since I tend to find an issue with every any character I find in an anime like this but not this one and I commend the author for creating such wonderful characters! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- This anime had a lot of good moments, moments that made me go 'aww' or made me laugh, this anime was very enjoyable to me and I was looking forward to each episode. And one of the quirks about the episodes is that we see focus on pretty much every character and no one is left out, which i find rather hard to balance with harem series like this with more then one female lead but this was executed really nicely, the jokes were all funny and the ecchi moments weren't too over the top either. Overall, I enjoyed the anime through and through and didn't get bored at all and was thoroughly entertained!\\n\\n\r\nOverall- I would recommend this anime for anyone who loves the slice of life genre like I do, or anyone who loves comedy or fan service or even ecchi anime like this, but like before if you don't like incest or don't like ecchi and are very close-minded then I wouldn't advise this anime, but if you can get past those little details then you'll find a very funny and enjoyable anime out of OniAi! I would especially recommend this to anyone who loves the romantic comedy genre of anime. I honestly don't see why this anime gets bad reviews, I've seen my share of bad anime before and this one wasn't one of them!",

            "content": "I'll start off by saying that i dropped this anime at episode 4...but I do have a pretty good understanding of the story. At least as much as you can get in 4 episodes.\r\nStory-4\r\n-----------\r\nThe summary of the show didn't particularly draw me in, but I do find ecchi shows to be funny and enjoyable, and the incest love thing was at first thought sickening to me, but then I decided to look past that and just enjoy it. That just became impossible because of how boring the show is though. I found episode 1 to be the most interesting and it got boring fast startingat 2 and by 4 I just couldn't stand it anymore.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt-6\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe art is probably the best thing about this show, and that's not saying much. It's bland and typical. I'm mostly referring to the characters of course because everything else is just meh.\\n\\n\r\nSound-6\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nThe OP/EDs of the show are enjoyable, but not anything I would download and listen to in my free time. The voice actors are good, but it's sad they got put on a show like this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-1\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are the show, and they're not the best.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-3\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nI got some enjoyment out of the show, for the weird take on a harem, but it was just not a show I could bring myself to finish or miss.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall-5\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nThis show could have been something interesting. Instead, the only thing i'm taking away is Japan has no limits to where they are willing to go, perverted wise. That's what makes a lot of anime great, but it's the only thing that makes this anime exist and it just isn't enough.",

            "content": "Hi! Another Robert's Too Late Review coming to assault your eyes! This time we're going to be looking over Oniichan dakedo Ai sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne. The first point of note is good lord could they not come up with a shorter name??? Guess not. In all honesty I came across the title as being something similar to Kissxsis, and not believing anything *not* hentai could be like that title, I started the first episode with a somewhat cynical eye. I mean, I have no problems with taboo subjects, I did thumbs up Yosuga no Sora after all, but I didn't expect much fromthis 'Oni ai' or what have you. I absolutely did not imagine it would be in consideration for a spot on the RTLR wall of indecency! \\n\\n\r\nBut not half way in, I knew I had to see this series, and I can say I honestly had a blast watching it. There are reasons why the review scores aren't higher than a statement like that would seem to warrant and we'll get into it, but by and large let me assure you this is *not* like Kissxsis or even Yosuga no Sora. This is much more odd-paired humor with ecchi touches joined to a story about a guy who will do ANYTHING to avoid committing incest with his sister, or even avoid the appearance of impropriety. In doing so, hijinks ensue! \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nThe premise is somewhat interesting, I will leave the synopsis to explain the finer details of that. The issue I have with the story premise is the 'why' of it all. Why do the siblings have to live in an old dorm? Why does the 3 other Student Council members (and an eventual 4 girl) have to live in there as well? No explanation is really given, not one that has a whit of impact or meaning at the very least. It's just 'they are living together in a dorm, without proper adult supervision, because well they just are, and if you don't like it, we can take it outside' at which point I reassured the show that I wasn't judging it and offered to buy the next round of drinks. Of course the Council members are all girls, and attractive in their own ways. Not a guy to be found, other than our lucky (unlucky?) main, who has to not only fend off his perverted sister, but the rest of the babes as well. \\n\\n\r\nOf course the main is a gentleman, of course avoiding incest (as I'd like to think we ALL would) but he also doesn't enter into a romantic relationship with any of the girls in the dorm with him. He even has an opening (not guaranteed like the dorm girls, but a chance I think) to hook up with his adult publisher boss, and he even passes on that. I know from experience there is an anime for nearly any taste out there, sometimes I think I'd like to see one like this where the guy jumps on the busty president or takes the athletic best friend to bed and then deals with the drama around having a sexual relationship with one (or more) of the housemates. I imagine something like that is out there, I just haven't browsed the proper places. But anyway, the guy is surrounded by these beautiful girls (and his sex obsessed sister) and in his attempt to keep pure a number of hijinks occur, as the girls launch plan after plan to nab him. This provides most of the entertainment for the show, of how the poor guy is going to avoid the man-eating girls around him.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned the whole issue of explaining why they were in that situation to start with, well there's another few knocks that can be rightfully rapped against the title. One of them being the 'who' of the household. Yes it's the Student Council, but there's a glaring problem with the blonde vice president. She's the daughter of a hugely rich industrial tycoon, and is so out of touch with real life she doesn't know how to unpack, and even spends a couple of episodes without underwear, not only because she doesn't know how to do laundry, but its shown that she doesn't know how to even put *anything* away. She just drops things where she is when she's done with them, and is basically non-functioning. How would a super rich girl who clearly has lived her whole life with servants end up alone in an 'old' (as often pointed out) dorm with no one to help her? She's there because she's deadpan, out of touch with real life, and a good fulcrum for a lot of the jokes, that's why. That's really part of the biggest complaint I have, many things are the way they are purely because the show says so, and again it'll kick your ass if you don't like it. \\n\\n\r\nThey don't bother to explain anything that doesn't fit the whimsical or helps set up a joke/ecchi scene. This lowers the score for me on a lot of levels because in moments between funny scenes I couldn't help but ask why the situation even existed. But that also is part of the appeal of the show, there aren't many moments where we have time for such questions. The jokes flow quickly and the wackiness rarely lets up. You don't have time to wonder why the huge breasted president has an eye patch when she's doing everything in her power to expose said breasts to the guy in an attempt to seduce him. The rapid fire jokes, ecchiness, and silliness leave little room for serious consideration on why things are the way they are. \\n\\n\r\nBut there is enough time for those thoughts to surface here and there, so the lower score, even though I openly admit enjoying the show. Humor is good, but sometimes a tiny bit of logic really makes a difference. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI found the anime to have good art, I really like the styling they used to draw the eyes, the girls are all detailed for the most part, and their personality is evident through the art. There are playful visual gags and jokes which I found humorous, and overall the art flows well. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI loved the opening and ending songs, they are silly, light and fun. The odd thing about the opening was that at times the show would be literally half over before they would spin the song. Not something I've seen before. The voices are all well done. The main guy has a voice I'd classify as 'normal' which in a lot of these ecchi type shows can be unusual, as the guys often sound like dolts or other variations of idiots. This guy sounded intelligent enough and was articulate. The girls had great voices for the most part. The 'sister's voice was slightly shrill and loud, but considering she's demanding an incestuous relationship, she should sound like that, I believe. The busty president always confident and eager, the rich girl has an awesomely creepy monotone, and the sporty (and likely closest to 'normal' girl) has a bright voice. Everyone sounds great, and the music is fun. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe characters are fun, but somewhat over the top, and the show would not have suffered if they would have dialed some of it back. To start the main guy is really normal, and not a slobbering idiot, which as I said in an ecchi is always a plus, but for some reason they make him a part time writer. Not only does he attend high school, but he also writes romance novels on the side. Of course he doesn't write normal romance, he writes, surprise surprise, incest novels. Why a guy who literally has to fend off his sister's CONSTANT sexual advances would write such seems nothing more to me than a less than funny joke. I can get down with silly humor, but that's just cliche to the point it hurts. Also, it seems that he is made to be a part time writer purely to bring in yet another woman, his adult managing editor, who, under the guise of making sure he's not actually committing incest, becomes a short term member of the harem. She doesn't seem to have much other use, and his writing career seems to be there to facilitate yet another woman to lust after him. \\n\\n\r\nThe president is very sexually aggressive, though not as much as the incest obsessed sister, but pretty close. She uses her huge breasts and physical maturity to intimidate the other girls out of trying for the main, but also to attempt to seduce him as well, as one might expect. The problem becomes that EVERYTHING for her becomes part of her sexual aggression. She's mentioned to be bisexual once or twice, which is not a thing, but she uses the same '(wo)maneater' mentality about everything, and it gets a little predictable by the end. She's still fun, just kind of one note, something a lot of the girls suffer from. \\n\\n\r\nThe vice president, the rich monotone blonde seems to alternate between wanting to bed the main and being sexually attracted to first the 'sporty' girl, who has a slight build, and later when the last member arrives, a very young girl, she becomes the blonde's target. So I guess the rich girl swaps between the main and being a bit of a pedophile. This is a bit on the creepy side, clearly. We already have the whole incest vibe to deal with, we could go without also having one cast member being turned on by a 12 year old. The blonde also has a joke she repeats nearly every episode of the show it seems. It's related to her name, and it would take longer to explain than it does to tell the joke, so I'll pass on the details. Just know that it was slightly groan inducing the second time, and annoying as hell by the 10th. \\n\\n\r\nThe sporty girl is a very long time friend of the main, and would by my estimation have the most 'rights' to have a crush on him, but she is overshadowed by the rest of the cast. She isn't odd in the sense of having an outrageous feature like the other girls, but that makes her get lost in the cast very easily. Her issue is that she's in high school, and yet has small breasts and isn't stacked like the president or the other girls. That's first a normal thing for some girls to worry about which doesn't seem to fit this over the top anime, and secondly it doesn't stand out nearly as much as being a sexual predator or being obsessed with incest or being a closet bisexual that prefers her girls to have child-like builds (if not be actual children). So sporty gets lost in the shuffle pretty easily. \\n\\n\r\nIncest sister's issues are kind of apparent, she will do nearly anything to 'cross the line' with her brother. She hides in his futon, forces him to bathe with her and the girls, you name it. While this  could be considered the crux of the humor of the show, it depends on your viewpoint. Either you find it hilarious that she's so very determined, or you'll be weary by her endless antics. Of course if you find yourself wearied at her beating that dead horse, then this isn't the show for you. But I would note that there are moments you do want to tell sister to just give it a rest. \\n\\n\r\nThe final member of the harem appears several episodes in, and is a 12 year old girl as I mentioned in the rich girl's section. Not only does the young girl have to fend off rich girl, she speaks of herself in third person. Robert has no love in his heart for those that speak in third person! (har har)\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of these character flaws, they do all come together and balance out better than it would seem. It's not high art, nor is it the top of comedy, but its still a good time. I just want to make sure that I don't forget the shortcomings, and I'm known to do. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI laughed out loud at this anime several times. I did enjoy myself, but in a silly, 'I can't believe they did that' kind of way. It wasn't something that took very much thought, but it also wasn't something that appealed only to the lowest denominator (which is VERY easy to do with ecchi) and it didn't throw nudity around purely for attention. It isn't highbrow by any means, but it could have been much more childish. It was, well, a seven of ten. Not a waste of time, and being only a 12 episode series, short enough to be tolerable, and not so long as to really wear out its welcome. Its one of those series you just have to take what they give you, i.e. the setup, certain other things at face value and not ask questions, and just roll with the jokes as they come. If you don't try to deconstruct it, and overthink it, it can be a pretty good time. I wouldn't say big thumbs up, but I do recommend watching if you want to laugh at a fairly silly show. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the great RTLR wall of peer review, the group as a whole scored a spot for one reason: the end. Pay attention to the last 20 seconds or so of the show, as one hell of a kicker is dropped that made the show even funnier, in my opinion.",

Let's talk about this anime, a cringeworthy, so predictable, trashy and unfunny anime. Yes, I'm honestly saying that I almost hated this anime, thinking it was just a funny anime with an incest background like Oreimo, but I was expecting too much.\r\nOk, first of all, let's start with the story. (there will be possibly spoilers of the first episode only)\r\nWe have this girl, Himenokoji Akito, that after years of not seeing his brother, Himenokoji Akito, she finally reunite with him. They livetogheter under the same roof, they go to the same school together, shit like that, ok. But the fun fact is that Akiko, the sister, has an incestuous complex with her brother. But her brother doesn't care anymore, he's just, y'know, she loves her as a sister, she must protect her, bla bla bla. So yeah, we have this anime, with this annoying girl that this Akiko is, trying to flirting her brother, to have sex with him/marry him, in short, I N C E S T. And also in the first episode, we also have OTHER AMAZING CHARACTERS! EXACTLY, A HAREM WITH OTHER 3 GIRLS (and not only) TIPS FROM NOTHING.\\n\\n\r\nI gave to the story a 3, because y'know it's just a simple slice of life anime (one of my favourites genres in anime to be honest), but it's filled with so many ecchi scenes (yep, those ecchi anime scenes that I don't see since Sora no Otoshimono, that it's actually better), so many things I didn't understand because the anime didn't explain it very well - expecially the fucking ending, that made me fucking cry for anger, BECAUSE IT'S SO STUPID - and also, the main thing: it's not funny, for me at least. I literally felt embarassed every minute, in every scene I saw. I actually laugh in anime like this, but this anime didn't make laugh at all. It's so ridicolous, predictable, and already seen.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art I gave it a 7 because honestly, they did a pretty good job. Nothing else to say.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, yea, the opening is fine (nah) and I didn't listen to the ending because who fucking cares (at least for me for this anime).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, aaah, the characters. So predictable, unfunny, cringeworthy, stupid, and so on.\\n\r\nLet's see what we have.. hmmm..\\n\r\nThe little and cute sister, a crazy and autistic girl to be honest. She didn't see his brother since long time and she went just crazy. Literally, C R A Z Y.\\n\r\nThe stupid fucking brother, a light novel writer, and guess what? (spoilers, probably, don't read these words) He writes incestuous light novels, based on his real sister and him. Oh god.\\n\r\nThe apathetical tsundere.\\n\r\nThe.. pirate? Samurai? Girl with an eye patch? I don't fucking know, probably she's autistic too.\\n\r\nThe childhood friend.\\n\r\nThe loli.\\n\r\nThe editor of the amazing Brother. (I don't know, I honestly liked only this character, It's neutral, beside these ones).\\n\\n\r\nI will let you imagine how I enjoyed watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I gave this anime a straight up 3. Didn't enjoy watching it. I actually do enjoy lots of anime I watch, with the most simple plots too, but this anime is an exception. If you wanna watch this anime for having just a few laughs (you won't) or at least wasting your time, do it, you'll lose all your precious time, when you can rather watch some good anime, with ok, a simple plot? But definitely better than this.\\n\\n\r\n*drops mic*\\n\\n",

            "content": "In my opinion\r\nIt's kind of shocking when i watch this anime, i really doesn't expect that this anime will show many heavy-ecchi parts. First i though it's just like a normal daily life, but it turn out to be so much different than i have predicted.\r\nThe story is kind of irregular, there was no clear-conclusion where the plot will take us. It's more like a collection of short stories of what kind of life that Akito have.\r\nThe art is good, the color used is fit with the genre of the anime.\r\nThe sound, i love the voice actors! Each characters have their own unique method oftalking and their own unique accent (you'll know if you watch it), especially when Akiko make a \"guhehehe\" sounds, it's right to the spot. I don't really like the op and ed songs though.\\n\r\nThe characters, personally i just like Akiko, Anastasia, and Arashi. They have their unique characters and their designs is great too. For the other heroines, i think the personalities they inherit is too simple, so it really doesn't leave a mark.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime for those who love comedy, daily-life, harem, romance and ecchi.\\n\r\nThis anime is made for those who want to laugh, but please remind that there are so many dirty jokes among them. So for those who dislike ecchi stuff, it's better to not watch this. Not just the dirty jokes, there are also many fanservices in this anime so watch your back when you watch this! XD\\n\r\nThis anime focused more on the harem parts than the romance parts, so you'll found just a few doki-doki emotions from the heroines (many of them come from Anastasia which make her very cute).\\n\r\nThe easy daily-life with many comedy parts make this anime fun and no-tiring to watch. Altough the plot is unclear, the entertaintment is enough to make up for it.",

            "content": "This one is hard. Definitely a guilty pleasure.\r\nOverview:\r\nI came to this after reading the light novels it was based on. I won't say I loved the novels, I sometimes had to skip over the parts with Anna in them, but I admired their depictions of Akito as a very sound minded kind of guy. He's stuck in a very moe situation, I won't say harem, but very close to it, and unlike most harem heroes, he keeps his head about him. Very little really freaks this guy out. Three girls including his sister are coming onto him hard and he stays relatively cool and caneven be very charming and insightful. A lot of times his dialogue, just his ability to keep calm and say the right things to break up the moe and keep it real honestly impressed me at times. \\n\\n\r\nIt went so far I had to believe I was misreading the novels. After all it was a translation and it was just writing. Maybe the author intended that Akito was really screaming these lines. Could he really be this cool? I seriously doubted it. And I want to thank this anime, because without it, I would never have been sure just how cool the character of Akito could be. As it turns out, he was everything I dreamed he was and more. I love this character and his depiction in the anime, I have to say pretty much borders on perfect.\\n\\n\r\nNow is when I should probably bring up that the disgust generated by this anime caused the people who were working tirelessly translating the light novels to drop them completely.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem I think is that the studio was looking for a harem anime to capitalize on Oreimo's success and well, the novels just weren't quite moe enough. I can't help going into some detail on the changes they made, I'm sorry. If you want the short version, they messed it up both in big ways - really freaking huge ways - and in small subtle ways as well.\\n\\n\r\nPremise:\\n\r\nThe story starts just after Akito has spirited his twin sister Akiko away in the night from the estate of her adopted parents to the run down old fashioned shack of a house he rented because he's a freaking hero and he can't help it. Only in this version he just kind off bought what looks like a mansion and waited there for her to come to him after shipping most of her stuff. \\n\\n\r\nOkay no more details. It's been seven years since Akito and Akiko were adopted and split up by rival families because their parents died and these rivals saw an opportunity to eliminate the opposition. Akito at that time swore to Akiko that one day they would be reunited. They would live under the same roof again, retake their family name, and no one would ever force them apart again. And seven year's later he's finally done it. \\n\\n\r\nOnly Akiko, reflecting for seven years on the words he spoke to her has come to believe that the two of them were desperately in love with eachother as children and his oath was a declaration of love and his intent to effectively marry his sister. And now the time has come and she is all for it. Akito's feelings can be summed up in his line, \"I love you more than anyone else in the world - as a sister.\"\\n\\n\r\nNow the anime jumps I don't know how many months ahead and has very little else to do with the novels from now on. Akito, Akiko and three other girls now all live together in this mansion as the four girls compete for Akito's affection. It has turned ito a full on harem fanservice anime and you only really have to watch the opening to get the picture. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI'm not going to explain all the characters for you, Ana and Arashi are mostly the same as they were in the book (that is to say, fanservice characters) only a whole hell of a lot less subtle about it. The anime also completely omits the family politics thing that kinda gave Ana and Asrashi a good reason to be here, so pretty much just fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nAkiko is fairly well depicted though they cut a lot of her best dialogue short. Akito is beautifully depicted, though he narrated the novels so of course a lot of his best stuff had to be cut out. But they actually added in a bunch of great dialogue for him so I won't complain\\n\\n\r\nIt's Ginbei that really gets my goat. In the novels, I loved Ginbei, especially her downright eloquent phone conversations with Akito. And in the anime we skip over all those phone conversations and she's a Tsundere. You will notice, Ginbei is not mentioned among the characters and voice actors above, and that is right. For me, there is no Ginbei in most of this series.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nStill, I have to say, there are a lot of good bits to this anime. The first episode, the beginning of the second episode. The flashback episode (Akito was already a goddamn hero when he was just ten years old). There a little snippet when Akito is sick that's definitely worth watching. It's just great to see some of these scenes depicted on screen. They do take certain scenes from the novels and throw them around here and there without screwing up the dialogue too much and those scenes are genuinely pretty good. Even some of the added scenes, like Psudo-Ginbei's moe shtick with the kitten, are pretty darn decent. This is one of those animes which are honestly painful for me to watch from beginning to end, but now that I've finished watching it, I go back to it all the time just to watch an episode or a scene that I just can't get out of my head. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know if I can recommend it. I give it a four because I think maybe four tenths of the series are worth watching and re-watching. iIf you're not cool with incest, there isn't any but you'll probably want to skip this anyway. If you like incest romances at all, go read the novels, or at least the volumes that were translated and if you like those, go ahead and watch the series.",

In the end I did end up enjoying the anime though and recently picked it backed up and enjoyed it just as much a second time.\r\n Like most SOL anime the series starts out like it has a plot but doesn't reallytake it anywhere. Most episodes just consist of the girls competing to try and win over Akito and others are them going out and having fun with each other. I myself don't need to have a strong plot in every anime I watch so personally I found all the episodes to be enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\n The art is very pleasant to look at with bright colors and detailed backgrounds. The sound track was also a great part of the anime with catchy upbeat music and I don't think I skipped over the intro once while watching the series.\\n\\n\r\n If you're wondering if you should watch this series I would definitely recommend it.

The other heroines - as decent as they are, seem to be just put into this anime at random to fill the spots in the usual harem party. \r\nThis started quite nicely in the first episodes but become less intresting with letter episodes when the other heroines got more of the screentime. Enjoyable but leading nowere and dissapointing.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end it is just another schematic harem anime with a huge amount of echii in form of skirt lifting, noughty dialogs and ocasional sexual innuendos. Nothing really disturbing though. No actual h-scenes (even mild).\\n\\n\r\nIf you hurting for a things to do and you want a title that you can watch without giving much thoughts to the story, expecting some laughs in return, this anime will provide you with a decent entertaiment. Just dont expect too much.\\n\\n\r\n+ Nice and unique main heroine -Akiko\\n\r\n+ technicaly well done\\n\r\n+ still provides decent amusement\\n\\n\r\n- plot that doesnt go anywere (ar isnt there at alll)\\n\r\n- other heroines added just for the sake of diversity\\n\r\n- plain simple schematical \\n\\n\r\nScores:\\n\r\nStory                3\\n\r\nArt                    8\\n\r\nSound               6\\n\r\nCharacters       5    (75 %value  for Akiko)\\n\r\nEnjoyment        7\\n\r\nOverall              6\\n\\n\r\nHave fun \\n\r\nOmatase !",

            "content": "Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeneinai Yo Ne! (in short OniAI, and yes a long named anime) is a fairly generic Ecchi Harem. The story is rather plain with the slight change that is Akiko (MC Akito's Sister) wants to be with him like, well, incest. Three other characters join by the end of the episode basically to make it a harem I guess. Those characters (with description) are Arashi the student council president at the school they all go to, all the while being most sexualized with having tits that look like water balloons, Anastasia who is the Vice President and basically a Kuudere,and Ginbei who is the student council treasurer, and in my opinion my favorite character even though all of them are awfully written. You also have characters that show up later such as Jinno who is Akito's editor for his story and Arisa who is just a loli side character. The animation was done by studio Silver Link, which has done other anime that I will not state because honestly look it up, and they did a pretty nice job on making this garbage something to look at when it came around for the Ecchi scenes. The sound is unmemorable as I can't remember anything other than the opening, which just like a lot of Ecchi anime has sexualization. I really did not like this anime despite a few laughs here and there mostly being \"wtf\" moments. Nothing happens for most of this anime anyways other than a couple backstories that didn't change anything about the characters that we already knew. In all if you are looking for something that fits taste of a masochist, give it a shot. If not, completely avoid this!",

            "content": "As most harem style anime the only reason to watch it will be the ecchi or romance scenes. Since this anime doesn't contain real romance and only has 'showoff ecchi' I can't be praising this anime at all. Since the sound and art are quite good I have something positive about this anime. But because of this I can't rate this anime that good.\r\nWhen we see a romance anime we always have some parts that should be filled up, they chose like most romance animes to add comedy in the anime for the fill up.\r\nSince the comedy in this anime is making fun of somebodyand tricking them, you might find this boring and not interesting at all. I did not like to comedy.\\n\\n\r\nNote: You can have a different opinion on everything I say.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nA romance story most of the time contains: Explaination of the characters or an explanation of their living situation or both in rare cases.\\n\r\nOnii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne! did both and that's really good of them, but the story itself isn't good at all. The explanation is really bad and show a lack of info. The living situation is so poorly explained i don't even know why he has that super large house for himself. But that is like the main place so it doesn't matter I guess. (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nSweet art which shows the more friendly side of the anime. The background work is done well and the general art is decent. Nothing to complain.(7/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound pack of this anime is not really satisfying at all. The voice acting is quite good and that's it. That Could use some work, but is decent. (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nWhenever I see a romance anime it's needed to be really good and should explain a couple of things about them like: Housing, Personality, Age, Extra info and History. Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne! only did the housing and age part. Which is Frigging bad. Besides that the characters are all the same. They look different and that's it. It's just horrible.(1/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWell if you love a bad character design and story with decent art & sound I guess you would love this. But it's just not enjoyable and I waited out for something to happen. Nothing happened so I dropped it. With a lot of fan service and many filler I guess it might be enjoyable by some, but in general it's not really satisfying.(3/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nA harem ecchi anime focusing on 'showoff ecchi' with a bad character design and story making it not enjoyable and not recommendable to anybody.\\n",

I would like to say that this, is extraordinary.\r\nBecause who the heck doesn't want a little sister that wants to marry her own blood brother?  Hmm?\r\nSo let's get down to business on why this anime is worth watching to those siscons out there, and the rest of you little closet perverts around.\r\nFirst of all, the story is about a this guy's little sister wanting to marry him. Seems easy to solve doesn't it? Just hit her chances down and explain the World Constitutional Law on Marriage to herright? Nope. She's hell bent on making him marry her. Best of all she has NO INTENTION of hiding of her Bro Complex whatsoever. So some laughs guaranteed.\\n\\n\r\nArt is as you expected from an anime in the 21st Century. Nothing much to explain here.\\n\\n\r\nThe Studio has done a good job on making the characters as appealing as possible. A high-artistrocat, a loli and much much more. Character-wise their actions are accordingly to their aura. In other words, what you think they will do, they will do.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know why, but I really enjoyed watching this anime. I wouldn't mind rewatching this in a succeeding year-time or so. I probably enjoyed this because of the really new (and non cliche too) storyline and I hope for a season two also.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up. Siscons, Brocons, LoliCons, rejoice! This is an anime worth of your time.\\n\\n",

            "content": "What an atrocity. I understand that there's the ecchi tag associated with it. I know there's the harem tag associated with it. \r\nThis takes the concept of story and throws it out the window. The premise seems alright, seems like it could be leading somewhere within five minutes of the show and opening. I got a similar feeling to a Key Anime beginning, something like the intro of many good Anime titles like Ai Yori Aoshi, or Kanon (2006) or Air. \r\nBoy does it fool you real quick. Within minutes of establishing what could possibly be an interesting plot, it proceeds to shit the bed.\\n\\n\r\nI mean this takes cliches of the harem and ecchi tag/genre to the extreme.\\n\\n\r\n- Halfwit MC? Check\\n\r\n- Weird BroCon Moe younger sister? Check\\n\r\n- Randon harem of girls that are SOOO into the MC, probably because all their brain matter got stored in their breasts? Checkerony \\n\\n\r\nNow you might be saying, but bonobear, whats wrong with that? You gotta have some suspension of disbelief here, this is a work of fiction right. And this is an ecchi harem, I mean you're expecting too much. Do I expect some Kubrick-esque qualtiy of media here? No of course not, its a friggen ecchi harem. But there are ecchi harems, and then there are ecchi harems and then there is this. \\n\\n\r\nFirst you want a harem with at least some semblance of plot? Try Shuffle. \\n\r\nYou want some quality incest is wincest anime that isn't some shit ecchi tag half measure? Try Yosuga no sora\\n\r\nYou want an actual discussion on a taboo subject handled maturely? Try Koi Kaze. \\n\\n\r\nWhat, you mean you want all three, but really you just want another FRIGGEN HAREM you say? Well luck be it for you, this series is not it. \\n\\n\r\nSeriously, go watch My sister is among them. At least that has some semblance of plot and mystery. \\n\\n\r\nBack to OniAi which we will now refer to as VoidOfContent or VOC if  you will. So VOC in its short span of 24 minutes of a typical episodes proceeds to:\\n\r\n- introduce a completely random harem of girls, with no explanation outside of using overplayed tropes, and tits. Lots of tits. No background story, no explanation as to their driving force behind the attraction to the MC. Nope just tits. And some desire to feed him, go AHHHHH and shove the food in his mouth, much like VOC shows its empty media into your brain. Seriously, one character is some tall busty samurai with an eye patch, no explanation. The hell sort of highschool is this? In fact scratch that, you call this sad excuse a story and character design. WHEN THERE ARE HENTAI's WITH BETTER STORIES, YOU DONE MESSED UP SON. \\n\\n\r\n- A sister meeting her brother after a long period of time, and trying to sleep with him within in moments of meeting. Look guys I get it, you're used to MC's waking up with some moechan younger sister that looks like she's a college aged girl but is apparently only 14 somehow screaming and waking you up saying ONNIIICHAN. No respect for knocking on doors, or locks, or windows or the laws of physics, no no, like clockwork your little imoto will be waking you up with your morning blowjo... i mean alarm clock. I mean do we know why she's so in love with her brother? Is it the weakest reason ever, absence makes the heart grow fonder. or is it some lame excuse for plot that the team behind this marvelous piece of art came up with? The world will never know. \\n\\n\r\n- a sad attempt at a slice of life. We've seen it done to death folks and this may be the worst iteration yet. I'm talking, random high school club with everyone somehow having officer status with no membership to speak off, combined with a combination of a boarding room management system. Are these guys adults, managing high school, chasing after MC and a whole friggen dorm all by themselves. Truly Japan is the nation of productivity. I mean come one is this really a joke? \\n\\n\r\nThis anime feels like its parodying the ecchi and harem genre but somewhere a long the lines it took itself too seriously and what was fact and what was fiction got blurred.",

I've noticed that other reviews give scores of (8 or higher) OR (3 and lower).  Its not very logical but that shows you how the fans see this anime and why its unfortunately ranked at #3000.

You look at the episodic themes and situations with the comedy and its characters.\\n\\n\r\nI HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS to anyone who likes this type of anime,  YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED and if your not a fan please do not watch 3 episodes and give it a shitty score.  At least watch the whole series before you judge. \\n\\n\r\nIt is my pleasure to have written this review and share this AWESOME ANIME with you. :)",

There is something that makes it quite unique compared to other harem anime genre, so we do not just say, \"Ah, that here again ....\". Perhaps because of the way to introduce the character of thegirls who walk backwards. Rather than bring them together with the main character Akito one by one in a most awkward situation, this anime directly collectthem around before then recounted their past to engage with Akito. Or maybe because the moments of romance that feels a little different. Doesnot mean completely new, but presented its own peculiar way. Or maybe it's comedy. Not the funniest, but still be able to make anyone smile amused. Although still far from being regarded as a good work, anime story is still capable of being entertaining interlude in the midst of busy.",

            "content": "Warning: This review is coming from someone who has probably watched a lot less anime than you. All the same, hope you find something in it :3\r\nThis is honestly the best romantic anime I've ever seen...yeah, if you look at my anime list there's not a whole lot to compare it to. But honestly this one blew me out of the water.\r\nI feel the problem with a lot of ecchi (if this even counts as that) is that it will subordinate everything for the sake of fanservice. I'll admit, I was drawn towards this anime based on the fact that it was, yknow, hot -but I stayed for completely different reasons.\\n\\n\r\nFor a start the art is superb. Yeah, it's not too stylistic, but definitely not a rushed job either. The music was nice too (especially the closing song omg), but what this anime really has going for it is the characters.\\n\\n\r\nLike, just to start, Akito's relations with the girls actually seem real enough for him not to want to go further with them. Like, he either has an obsessive sister, a pyschopath, his best friend, a nymphomaniac, a small girl or his boss XD It really sucks in harem anime where you're just like \"Jesus Christ why are you not going for this girl?\" The important thing to remember is that this anime doesn't exploit the idea of a brother-complex, but more so makes fun of it. Like, Akiko is annoying and dumb, but like, that's the whole point.\\n\\n\r\nBut all the girls themselves are pretty interesting. As far as I can tell none of them (except maybe Akiko) are too stereotypical. In fact if you look at it by the time you get halfway through the show isn't really about the incestuous relationship in the title. The best part of the whole series BY FAR has to be Gin's backstory with Akito, about the way the became friends. It was just so cute and funny and heartwarming and ugghghghghhg.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that I thought the whole thing was genuinely funny. The humour wasn't confined to obvious \"oops I slipped and landed on oni-chan's crotch\" jokes; there was a good mix of funny animations and well written humour. Ana was particularly well done, being so deadpan and confusing really added something to the show.\\n\\n\r\nTbf the only negative things I would say are that the final episode didn't really wrap things up too well (though there might be second season?) and that it became a little bit fan-servicey at some points...just some angles left me thinking about how unnecessary they were.\\n\\n\r\nSO, if you're looking for a lighthearted but well done romantic thing (and also don't mind the idea of incest) then I'd say definitely check this one out! :D",

            "content": "Some minor spoilers ahead:\r\nOkay, I'm going to start off by saying this is my first review and I am only actually doing this because a lot of the other reviews are kind of harsh and don't take something into consideration. Now, I consider myself pretty open minded and watch a good amount of ecchii and harem comedies so its not like I get surprised very often, but this one did catch me off guard, in a good way.\r\n*~Story~*: This...is pretty basic and bland for the majority of the series. Its so cookie cutter, I wouldn't normally consider giving this above a 6 usually and Iwould say other's reviews are justified, HOWEVER, this did something rather unique. You have the incestuous sister, 3 additional heroines who have no real story of showing up except to suddenly be there as a way to get into the sister's way of pursuing her forbidden love and eventually even the teacher who seems smitten for the MC for no other reason than she just has to be to lead him on a proper path. Jokes ensue and its really nothing special from whats ever been done before, except...the ending. The ending had a couple of hooks in it that I found very novel and I will admit I was surprised and didn't see them coming. You find out there ARE deeper motives to these girls that had supposedly just shown up and there is more to just falling for the MC just for the sake of plot. To me, the ending is a very integral part of the show, there have been very many that were fantastic and really superior only to drop the ball at the very end. This is a rare exception in where it did the total opposite. The ending actually redeemed the rest of the show, it made the previous 9 episodes or so of watching it worth it.\\n\\n\r\nStory score: 8. I'd rate this higher if there was some notable things throughout the story, but as highly as I rate the ending its not everything, especially when you might lose most your audience before they even get to see it.\\n\\n\r\n*~Art~*: This is cute. While its not spectacular by any means, nor does it particularly have anything to make it take itself serious or engaging, the characters themselves seem oddly disproportioned/designed. This isn't really a bad thing though, it really fits with the easy going nature of the show and are easy on the eyes. Each of the characters is distinct save the MC himself who is made so painstakingly generic it can only be done on purpose. \\n\\n\r\nArt score: 7\\n\\n\r\n*~Sound*~: This is probably the weakest part of my review because if I am honest, I don't have much of an ear for music. That said, nothing stood out to me nor did anything particularly bother me, I didn't even think of it at all as I watched. Leavening me to say it left no impression either way.\\n\\n\r\nSound score: 7\\n\\n\r\n*~Character~*: Okay, this is where a show like this is usually made or broken. I mentioned that many of the girls just pop up with no real purpose, love the MC for no real reason, and frankly are...very typical. There is nothing about them that should make this particularly stand out, however I don't want to give anything away, but the ending reveals a depth to them that is not at all apparent through the majority of the show. The are mainly eye candy and there to compromise the MC's standing with the little sister and pursue deviant like activities with the protagonist because...plot. The main issue I have is that there is no real depth or unique traits to any of the heroines unitl...said plot device happens. It actually happens so abruptly and without actual warning, I can't help but feel it was just kinda added as a last minute idea and as far as that goes it was a great one. The characters are mildly funny and each is great in the delivery of the role they portray keeping this rather simple and easy to enjoy\\n\\n\r\nCharacter score: 7\\n\\n\r\n*~Enjoyment~*: This is a very simple comedy/ecchii, you don't have to think too hard about. Its not going to really stand out as a great title, but its something that is a nice break when you are on a horror/suspense binge or perhaps just need a comedy with a bit of sex appeal to it. I personally like titles like this since I am all over the board with what I watch, and some shows can be very emotionally draining, so a simple comedy with pretty girls to look at is nice. I know I keep harping on it, but I was floored by the ending. As someone that watches a lot of ecchii/comedy/harems and still being took by surprise was quite novel, and I enjoyed the reason behind the girls that much. As pointless as it started out to be, the ending gives you a very good clean up of it, but only if you're the type that will be patient to get that far in the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment score: 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I gave it an 8. Many people are right, this show is pretty lack luster, but its simple and you can turn your brain off for it. Its not something I'm gonna say people need to rush to go see, however, it offers a unique take on the harem genre I found refreshing. So much so I at least decided it didn't deserve all the harshness a majority of the reviews say. You won't be missing much by passing on this, but I can't help that this title got wasted somewhat. That ending brought together such an intriguing plotline to it, it feels like the mediocrity that lead up to it doesn't do it justice and that with better planning or story management, this could have been a very epic anime in its own right. Sadly, one great idea is useless when nobody will get to the point to appreciate it because of tedious/poor lead up.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want ecchii/comedies that might stand out because of being slightly beyond the norm and have better story throughout, I suggest to try\\n\r\nRokujouma no Shinryakusha or Boku Ha Tomodachi Ga Sukunai",

            "content": "\"Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne!\" was a pretty decent anime. I can't wait until the Special comes out. \r\nI didn't expected the ending would be so plain. I expected a more erotic ending scene to finish of the storyline. Unfrounatley, I didn't get what I wanted. The Charters were pretty good. I don't like how they placed the characters' characteristics , personalities, etc. I find watching Akiko, Akito and Arashi interesting. Other than that, others i never find it very interesting. It was appealing. Akito is the spotlight of the show because he is the main. The character showed very appealing thoughts.Akiko was also interesting because she was attached to Akiko. Arashi was good. I wished Arashi was more token depth while making the storyline. She is good looking anime character. She also has a mix personality, very appealing.\\n\\n\r\nI am assuming there will be more and better erotic scenes in the Special. Which right now is not released yet or I am unable to finid it. I hope so , soon. \\n\\n\r\nI give this 8 , overall. A little above average anime show. Looking forward to the special.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. there may be errors in this review . Sorry.",

It is packed with a lot of dirty jokes. and many more that might be considered adult piece. But be aware it is not a hentai anime! \r\nStory/Enjoyment:\r\nIt has a great story. It has a lot of funny scenes. The jokes were never boring. And I cant say that it has a clear plot. Because it did not really stay on a clear path for each character. Well its still fun to watch. Especiallywhen you are bored and just want to laugh hard. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nIt has a great art. It really made the show watchable. Sound is great. the OP and ED is great. Voice actors are good. Nevertheless it made the show great!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe most loved part of the anime. Each characters is packed with different personalities. In this anime every character was shown off. Although Ana and Akiko did get a lot more dedicated episodes of them. Either way every character is great! Down to the design and their characteristic. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt is a great anime to watch especially if you are a fan of harem's. I think. I will rate this Mild. Parental Guidance might be needed. It has a lot of dirty jokes. But that what it makes it fun :))\\n\\n\\n\r\nN.B.\\n\r\nSorry for the redundant info's in each categories.

OniAi tells the story of Himenokouji Akito, a regular and responsible young man, hoping to live a regular and responsible life, whose younger sister, Himenokouji Akiko (the two having names that are a single letter apart can create confusion but it's a minor complain) is highly incestuous, demanding that Akito does some romantic thing with her at any given time. Other members of the harem which Akito does not acknowledge or recognise the existence of include his tomboyish childhood friend, seito kaichou and sexual predator as well as the ojou-sama who acts more unlike one than any othercharacter.\\n\\n\r\nOniAi is, above all else, a comedy, where the writing is of utmost importance. Fortunately for OniAi, this is where it shines. Whilst there are definitely better examples of writing in a comedy out there, OniAi has strong writing, and the comedy is strong and consistent, and while some episodes do appear to have prioritisation of the ecchi over the comedy, it still remains solid throughout, with no significantly bad episodes or parts.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, OniAi is a good watch. The humour and characters are good, the animation is well-done, and the interactions between the characters, especially those with Akiko never fall short. It's not groundbreaking, but it's definitely not bad. I'd recommend OniAi any day of the week.",

One of the reasons that this anime is so good is because of the MC. That dude is the definiton of self control. He is not a pussy like Rito from to love ru nor is he a complete pervert like Issei from High school DXD. Basically his character is just really likeable.\r\nAnother character that is just so loveable is his cute little imouto Akiko. If brocon of the year awardwas a real thing then she would win for sure. Her obsession with her older brother is just hilarious. Now i will say that this anime is sorely lacking in the character development department. Yes i know it is short and that there is only so much you can do with 12 episodes however i expected more character development. I will say though that there are some backstories in the second half of the show which gives some depth to the characters, but its not really enough.\\n\\n\r\nSo should you watch this? I would say yes if you like comedy ecchi animes. This is only my personal opinion but OniAi is my second favorite ecchi/comedy/harem anime. Dont take the anime too seriously, just sit back, relax and enjoy.",

That's right, the roles are reversed as this series tackles more on the female's perspective and does it in a hilarious manner.\r\nIn regards to plot... There's no plot. It's just one of those anime which would've been better as an OVA. But still, it's interesting to see why the little sister of the series is so obsessed with her brother.\r\nCharacters are... disposable. The MC is your typical ecchi/harem MC surrounded by beautiful girls who all want a shot at him.Also, the little sister resembled the heroine from Sankarea. Not really original, in my opinion. There is, however, one character that I personally liked: Anastasia. Now she's a character who's hard to define. She's not a kuudere because she sometimes act like a tsundere who is also quite perverted.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was... okay. The opening theme was hilarious and the ending theme was cute.\\n\\n\r\nWas it enjoyable? Yes, it was funny. And if I weren't a harsh critic, I would've given this anime a higher score.

Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne is a harem that's basically it but the thing is the main character doesn't love the girls back. I found it fun at some points and dull at some point. my main dislike about it is that the character design is a basic harem you have a friend, a foreigner, a sister, and a senior at the school. What I think could have made it better if they made the girls background a little better then the regular harem background. But there not tosay there isn't good parts. Some of the best parts where the weird scene where one girl want to have sex with him but he always fights his way out in a funny way that ends with someone finding them in a weird way that is totally not what he was trying to do. So I would recommend Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne to some of my anime friends the ones that like a regular harem.",

            "content": "Onii-chan dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne! is the generic of generic harem rom coms, with brocon thrown in. Ill start by saying I did not enjoy this anime, and i only watched it for the female heroine, Akiko. But some people enjoyed it so i guess you might like it? Lets see.\r\nStory-3/10\r\nNormally. i would give stories like this a 1/10. But harems don't need a good story. Basically, a brother lives in a house with a bunch of girls and his sister that all have the hots for him, and they get in all these ecchi situations. Basics of the basics.\r\nArt-7/10\r\nDidn't wow me,but it was good. The art alone isn't worth watching this by a long shot.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7/10\\n\r\nIt was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-3/10\\n\r\nIll start of by saying any characters besides Akiko are generic as hell. Not memorable, and for the most part, not really likable either. I found myself getting annoyed at them most of the time. ESPECIALLY the male protagonist. He is the nicest of harem males, the mormon at your school, or the neighbour you figured was too nice. He reacts very poorly to the ecchi situations and acts so disinterested in love, and dense that he takes my spot for the worst harem male lead ever. Akiko is what lifts the heavy anchor to a 3/10 instead of a 1/10. She unlike the others, is original, cute and very likable, the saving grace of the show. She was the only reason i kept watching, but i was also hoping to see a payoff, a scene where she gets to have beautiful romance with her brother. Unfortunately, that NEVER happens, the most you get is a cute scene, no kissing or any real ecchi moments between them that are worthwhile. Overall, everyone is poor besides Akiko.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-3/10\\n\r\nI said before, i did not enjoy the anime. The characters are the worst part of the anime, and it's also the most important really. Without good characters, i don't really see this worth watching. Akiko is the only reason and probably isn't enough. The ecchi situations are generic, and only a few were good. I found myself getting annoyed frequently, and there is no real strong climax of the series. Quite lackluster really.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-3/10\\n\r\nI didn't like this anime. The characters were weak and the whole thing was very generic. Akiko for me, is the only reason you could watch the show, otherwise stay away. The brotherly love is meh however. If you want more intimate brocon, watch Kissxsis. If you want more romantic brocon, watch Oriemo. While i didn't like the rest of the characters, others might and so if you like generic characters with brocon thrown in you may like this generic harem.\\n",

            "content": "***This review may contain information that might be regarded as mild spoilers***\r\nWell now there are many ways to approach this anime review. I could review it based solely on the anime or I could compare it to the light novel and inform you what was lost in the \u201ctranslation\u201d. For the sake of giving the anime a fair shot, I will score it based only on the anime itself but I will be injecting notes on what the anime could have done better in comparison to the light novel.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nSo the anime does a pretty piss poor job of explaining what is going on andkeeping your feelings invested towards the characters. The plot is essentially a reuniting of Akito and his sister Akiko after a long separation. They end up living in the same house along with the student council at their high school and the usually boy x girl events happen. The anime unfortunately comes across as a generic harem while the light novel feels more like a serious drama. The anime has all the typical harem scenes that we have experienced in the past; the shower scene, the mall scene, ext. I hate to say it but the anime really looks and feels as if it was put together very half-hazardly and was trying to ride on the success of the light novel. Please understand that this is NOT a faithful adaptation of the light novel.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is somewhat a mixed bag; it looks great in some scenes but the overall quality is somewhat lower than what I would expect from a 2012 anime. The characters are visually appealing but the show lacks a certain visual aspect that sets itself apart from all the other anime. This lighting is not done very well, you see many instances where proportions do not really match up, ext. The animation just comes off as generic for eighty percent of the time.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming quality for this anime in the sound department are the voice actors\u2019 performances. Each character\u2019s voice actor did a superb job injecting their feelings into their characters. Anastasia has a cold, monotone personality that is expressed well by her voice actor. Even the annoying but too cute Akiko\u2019s voice actor did an amazing job making Akiko a loved and disliked character. Other than the voice acting though the anime falls pretty low on the bar as far as sound goes. The background music is forgettable and generic but the intro and ending songs are quite catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of this anime work very well with each other even if most of them are forgettable. Akito, Akiko, and Anastasia were for me the stars of the show. Akito\u2019s strong will and intellect, Akiko\u2019s annoying but super cute personality, and Anastasia\u2019s cold and cool attitude created so many funny and unique scenes throughout the entire anime. My personal favorite character was Anastasia because even though her personality withheld most of her true feelings from everyone else, it was easy to always tell what was on her mind. Also her interactions with Akito were the most fun to watch. The other characters however were either boring or just not appealing. I especially found Arashi just out of place and a bother to the whole chemistry of the group. The young house leader was also quite annoying and off putting. Overall the main three characters really helps make the show shine but a couple others bring it back down.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime adaptation of Onii-chan Dakedo Ai Sae Areba Kankeinai yo ne (what a mouthful) is just generic. After reading some of the light novel a couple months before the airing of the anime, I was very excited to see the brother sister romance issue unfold with the student council. What unfortunately occurred here was taking a great drama with very thought provoking and witty conversations and turning it into another generic and barely passable harem anime. I advise that you steer clear from the anime and just read the light novel. It is much better than the anime and it will have you craving for more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "I don't care about incest, harems, fan service, lolis, or any other crap: what I want is a funny show that entertains me to the point I forget how shit IRL is. Anything else is a pleasant bonus surprise. Oniichan makes two critical mistakes that prevent it from being interesting:\r\n1) It's not lewd enough\r\n2) The entire point of the series gets boring about halfway through\r\nAs for the first point, even watching the uncensored version there weren't enough lewd moments to keep my interest, and because of the second point I actually began to nod off during the last couple episodes. I really don't know whyI kept on with it, except maybe avoiding work or the fact I was generally starving for harems.\\n\\n\r\nSeries like DxD or Monmusu maintain their lewdity from start to finish and also have good stories to tell while there aren't cartoon tiddies flopping back and forth. It's fun to stay involved in both senses. Oniichan doesn't have consistent fan service and the \"slice of life\" feel it tries hard to maintain doesn't present any interesting scenarios. There's a bikini judging contest towards the end of the series that was so utterly boring I don't think it could have been done any worse even if there was a free-entry contest called \"design the worst bikini judging contest and win five billion dollarioos.\" The last couple episodes are also quite heavy on flashbacks, and those aren't interesting either because I couldn't have given less of a fuck how these people met as kids since I just watched ten episodes of them being friends already. \\n\\n\r\nThe spicy incest angle is also boring to watch because the brother never once slips up in refusing advances and the sister is obnoxious in all ways. She isn't sexy or alluring or possessing of a funny, witty personality: she's a bratty bitch who never stops whining about everything. Supporting characters in the \"harem\" (it's weak and nothing at all like DxD, etc) have various angles to them but no depth to speak of. I also think the legitimate loli was gross, although maybe that's just my puritanical upbringing clawing its way through my adult facade.\\n\\n\r\nWhy not a 1? Because I still finished it. The premise was decent, and what little lewd scenes there were at least made me pay attention. I don't particularly regret watching either, but I definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone else unless you're like me and just about out of new harem shows that actually have some \"plot\" to them.",
