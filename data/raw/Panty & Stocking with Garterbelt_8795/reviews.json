            "content": "I'm not going to mince words here, gentlemen. This right here is what is commonly referred to as an \"orgasm of excellence\". This series is so good it'll probably kill you by the time it's done. As in, this thing Gainax has made here can roughly fall under the definition of autoerotic asphyxiation. But that's just a summary of the show's quality as a whole, let's break this shit down:\r\nPREMISE:\r\nTo put it plainly, the entire point of this show is to take the illusions otaku have surrounded themselves with for the last 10 years and annihilate them through a wanton, infinite assault  of sexand Western style. This show is not Sora ga Otoshimaru Hime Desu Beats! or whatever the hell it is you people watch nowadays. This is about a gun-toting whore and her diabetic goth friend slashing and shooting giant monsters literally comprised of shit, armies of dead sperm soldiers and their especially polite and well-mannered rivals, and when they're not doing something like that they're getting into some other shenanigans which may or may not involve parodying Transformers. Oh yeah, they're Angels or something under the command of Black Dynamite and have Gir as their sidekick and have to collect coins by killing monsters to get back into Heaven. But honestly, who cares? There are panties in this show that turn into guns and it's funny as fuck. \\n\\n\r\nBehind all this exquisite and sophisticated comedy is probably one of the most feminist morals ever, another thing that separates P&S from your average animu. Through the entire series, the female main characters do what they want, when they want, how they want while the male lead is useless, flaky and gets captured a lot. This motif boils down to \"It's okay to be a bitch. Live free and if you screw up have a man clean up after you.\" As you can see, this show's driving message has all the modesty of its main duo.  It's fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, that token Gainax ending. It's there and as wonderful as ever.\\n\\n\r\nIt's entirely episodic like a US cartoon, but with an overarching point. There are actually 26 episodes, but they're all 12 minutes long. Each episode is two episodes. That's right, this show has a 2x Quality Multiplier.\\n\\n\r\nTHEM GRAPHICS:\\n\\n\r\nThis show oozes with style that has pretty much never been tried before in the Eastern world. Think Dead Leaves (if you haven't seen this, take 40 minutes away from that time vampire Korean MMO I'm sure you have minimized in the corner and watch it. Dubbed only. It'll be the best thing you'll see all month) meets Power Puff Girls. The art and animation quality are as incredible as they are unique, using a potent blend of patented hand-drawn Imaishi scribbles, CGI and actual, real-life explosions at the end of each battle. The comic-styled on-screen sound effects from Dead Leaves also make a return here in full force, and they make the whole thing such a cool and unique experience. Another, minor thing I like is that the girls change clothes every episode, a subtle but welcomed touch that more cartoons should employ.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, it should be noted that this isn't an \"ecchi comedy\" (Those aren't funny or even passable as entertainment. If you came here looking for one of those and are now reading this review with a twisted expression of shock on your face, it should be noted that I personally and sincerely hate you and several things that look like you). Yes, there are more sex jokes than I've ever seen in a 12 minute cartoon segment, but the girls themselves are not fappable. That's the point. If something along the lines of \"UNFAPPABLE ANIME GIRLS?! WHAT IS THIS\" just escaped the blubber of your face, this isn't the show for you. In fact, most shows and animation in general isn't for you. As said in the previous section, this show was designed to be the antithesis of every ecchi moe series that has ruined anime in the last decade.\\n\r\nThe punchline is that there are often scenes where Panty and Stocking become similar to standard, over-proportioned anime women to cocktease otaku, and there are people here who're actually going \"i don't get it, why wasnt the whole show like that?\". Jesus christ\\n\\n\r\nTHOSE CHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nThis won't be hard. We have /eight/ main characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nPANTY: She loves sex and violence. Her panties turn into a gun named Backlace. In episode 1, she banged four or five guys. I love Panty.\\n\r\nSTOCKING: She loves sweets and goth frills, not to mention looking down on her sister's bad habits. \"Serves you right! I hope you shit out all your organs! Hahaha!\" Also her stockings turn into katanas and she has a bondage fetish. I love Stocking.\\n\r\nGARTERBELT: A large, angry, black afropriest who tries his hardest to make the derelict angels do their jobs. Dude is awesome and intense. Also, a pedophile.\\n\r\nCHUCK: literally Gir\\n\r\nBRIEF: The nerd who follows Panty around, the anime everyfan that the show makes fun of. \\n\\n\r\nSCANTY & KNEESOCKS w/ FASTENER: Creating a beautiful parallel to our lustful and gluttonous heavenly duo(along with terabytes of more fan art), these two demonic siblings are just grand and add a much-needed team of villains for P&S to unknowingly beat each episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOH LORD THAT SOUNDTRACK:\\n\\n\r\nUpon beginning this show, I got five seconds in. I hit stop. I hit play. \\n\r\nYes, my brain said, the theme song is, in fact, electrorock \"PANTY STOCKING, PANTY PANTY STOCKING YEOW!!\" \\n\r\nAs expected from a Gainax original series, this soundtrack is godlike and like Gurren Lagann's, it's extremely varied. The ED alone makes the whole thing worth getting.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is out now btw. It's missing a few good tracks so gainax can release another one later for more $$$ or something though. Still, it's just swell.\\n\\n\r\nTO SUMMARIZE:\\n\\n\r\nGainax is trollan' weaboos hardcore while simultaneously resurrecting the entire medium with Imaishi's bare, tired hands. If you like style, great music and actual humor then you'll probably like this a lot. Oh yeah, and it's easily a contender for Anime of the Year, right next to Rainbow, DRRR and Sym-Bionic Titan.\\n\\n\r\nTruly a work of art, the only setback is that it isn't dubbed, and due to crunchyroll's indescribable faggotry, it won't be for a while.  I have a strong feeling, that with a patented Funi gag dub(WHICH IS COMING IN 2012 OH MY GOD), this show's quality will burst into dimensions the human mind can't even acknowledge.\\n\\n\r\n(editor's note 2013: the dub is great)",

            "content": "\"So what's the point?\"\r\nThe main argument as to why Panty & Stocking is a masterpiece are all embellished ways of saying \"funny,\" \"it's a parody,\" and \"cool art.\" Some people go as far as to say that Panty & Stocking is actually genius scripting - a juxtaposition between today's current moe anime standard and hardcore \"American pop culture.\" I've even come across the explanation that Panty & Stocking is \"a new level of anime,\" one that doesn't require intricate or meaningful plot, characters, or story - essentially an anime that thrives on emotion and it's acute sense of humor.\r\nThat my friends, is complete bullshit.\r\nPanty &Stocking is an anime that relies on swears, penis jokes, and violence as its selling point. Now many anime have capitalized on at least one of these points before and have succeeded (Detroit Metal City, Seitokai Yakuindono, and Baccano! in respective order). So Panty & Stocking tried to do all three simultaneously. I found this not only moronic, but offensive. Never before have I actually been ashamed of watching anime. I am a male, and I have even strapped myself to a chair and watched such titles as Boku no Pico, Bible Black, the Ghost Stories dub, and a high amount of other borderline disturbing anime and media with radical content and ideas and not ever have I felt what I felt when watching Panty & Stocking. \\n\r\nI felt stupid.\\n\r\nWhat do I mean by that? I mean that Panty & Stocking insulted my intelligence and grouped me in the level of humor that one would find in such riveting pieces of American glory like \"Family Guy\" and \"Superjail.\" I personally watch anime because I view it as a medium that has great qualities that other media culture could learn from. I openly started Panty & Stocking with hopes that it would verily mock the troupes one could find in American media in a way that had not been done before. What I received was a trashbin of repetitive storylines combined with zero-dimensional characters that did nothing but yell about phallus's and excrement. The attempt on grasping American culture (even today's pop culture, which is what I believe Panty & Stocking wanted to poke fun at) disgusted me. Not once did I find the use of references to famous American films appropriate. Not only did the references have nothing to do with the episodes at hand, I felt that Panty & Stocking tried to take such references and use them as a tool of manipulation trying to coax viewers into thinking that Panty & Stocking was legitimately a smart piece of composition. I can easily see where people would be misled, that is with the art looking similar to various cartoons in America, Panty & Stocking must be a parody! Not at all. In fact, Powerpuff Girls had a stronger plot to begin with, and to even group this anime together with that cartoon would be slander to Craig McCracken. The animation may be new to Japan, but it has been seen before in cartoons, and it's been seen better so all exclamations like \"The art is weird so it's good!\" and \"Different art just isn't appreciated!\" are false. Gainax, one of the most acclaimed and profitable animation studios in Japan, truly abused the art style to boot. Watching only a few episodes you can see where corners were cut (which is extremely noticeable in episodes 10, 11, and 12.) A recap in a thirteen episode anime, should never be necessary. How is it that anime such as Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Monster, and Glass Mask, spanning over fifty episodes each never used a single recap episode in its main series, yet Gainax has the balls to put one in a thirteen episode /comedy/ series? Truly outrageous.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Panty & Stocking might as well have been pieces of shit or drivels of snot. Oh I must have forgotten. They are pieces of shit and drivels of snot. Nearly every antagonist, save the demon sisters whom I will touch upon in a moment, makes the characters from Mars of Destruction look creative. They exist solely to be discarded, and even worse, to swallow precious moments of your time away. The demon sisters who are introduced halfway through the series actually shined a beam of light down onto this hellhole of a production, but only briefly. They were first brought into play standing for everything that Panty and Stocking opposed and after their episode had ended, I hoped for more episodes similar to theirs to occur. But what do I get? A conflict that builds between the antagonists and protagonists for one episode, and then the demon sisters regress into Team Rocket. Never again are the demon sisters relevant as antagonists and most of the proceeding episodes are focused on them releasing some sort of monster and then failing as they fly into the sky. Now the supporting characters might as well be called the crippling characters, because that is really all they do to the overall story. Garterbelt does nothing but hinder the story and abuse the stereotypical \"all priests are gay child molesters.\" If this was meant to be a way to confront the issue in the Vatican, it failed, and if it was meant to be a funny comment on the church's political standpoint, then well, it failed again. Garterbelt assumes the role of mentor to Panty & Stocking but ultimately ends up being a total eyesore and teaches the protagonists nil. And then there's Chuck who is likened by many to Gir from the Invader Zim series. The main difference between the two is that Gir was actually funny. I really don't think I have to go into much detail on Chuck's character design because all he says is Chuck and is then squashed by a larger object. He plays absolutely no role at any point in the series, but there exists an episode in which he is the focus. After watching this episode I was very much tempted to sign up for lessons in Japanese so I could write angry letters to the writer in his native language begging him to quit his career in animation and move onto a medium that won't suffer from his obvious mental deficiency. Then is the character named Brief, who portrays the cliched disgusting otaku with no merits other than his apparently large penis. His atrocious character design is only overshadowed by Panty's single trait - how much of a gigantic unlovable disease infested whore she is. Both her and Stocking are obvious fodder for prepubescent virgin teenagers attracted to the sheer idea of sex. I would even go as far as saying that if this anime did not contain explicit transformation scenes in which characters remove their undergarments it would be nowhere near as acclaimed as it is. That is to say, the fanbase consists of perverts striving to find some deeper meaning in their anime which they try to defend by explaining that if you don't like it, then you must have a poor sense of humor or need to \"loosen up.\" Compare Panty & Stocking to Mitsudomoe - both anime including large amounts of sexual content used as jokes - Mitsudomoe has characters that possess qualities beyond \"she likes sweets\" and \"a huge bitch\" though. Panty & Stocking can't actually even compete with Mitsudomoe on a scale larger than sex jokes, because the characters and story are so disabled that it merely strives to fill the void with even more moments of mediocrity. I don't find Panty & Stocking unfunny because it doesn't suit my humor, I find it unfunny because there is no humor to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the canon discontinuation. Anyone who tries to makes sense of the abominable ending or any one of the episodes all together deserves to have themselves locked into a sanitarium. Another reviewer describes the two eleven minute episodes per episode as a \"times two multiplier\" but I would I disagree and say that it's actually a divided by two denominator. The split episodes merely reflect the inconsistency and the lack of coherency that Panty & Stocking exclusively has. One moment the entire cast is zombified, the next everyone is on the beach being sexually violated by sea monsters. Not ever will the story amount to anything beyond not having one.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Panty & Stocking, I will cede, is very good. The ending song, performed by Lisa, is wonderful and regrettably has very little to do with the anime. In the ending sequence a scene that appears to be a vague backstory on both Panty & Stocking exists, and alas once more, Gainax turned their noses away from such a sweet smelling idea. Even cartoons for the youngest of children have stories explaining the origination of their characters. Dora the Explorer had more character development than Panty & Stocking. Beyond the ending are numerous in episode tracks, whilist very enjoyable, I felt that many of them were overplayed and often unfitting (I can recall about four episodes ending with the song that includes the lyrics \"Clap your hands.\") The opening is closest thing to piece of satirical work - the song is a shout-out to all cartoons which only repeat the characters name over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you've actually read this far, I believe you've come to the conclusion that I hate Panty & Stocking. If you thought anything but that, then you're wrong, because I detest Panty & Stocking more than a Red Sox fan from Boston hates the Yankees. It is an insult to the medium of anime almost as much as is when someone says \"You like anime? Then you must love anime porn,\" and I will end this review saying Panty & Stocking does nothing but encourage statements like that. It gives a foul name to anime, for it lacks the fineness that geniuses like Tezuka and Kon worked themselves to death to bring us. When it comes to Panty & Stocking, I am disturbed with anime being associated with it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for people who may find this review too serious and that I must not have \"understood the point\" of this show I would like to say that I did not miss the point. You just made up a point yourself, because this anime lacks one.",

            "content": "If you're going to watch this show, you should know a few things right off the bat:\r\nIt is a not a sophisticated series.\r\nAs an anime in general,  its selling point is not a deep and compelling story with fleshed out characters, exploring various philosophical issues in order to deliver a good message. \r\nAs a comedy anime, its humor is not very classy. Its laughs are not derived from insider knowledge (well, most of them) or sublime writing.\r\nSo what exactly is the appeal of this anime, you ask?\r\nIn Gainax's own words, \"vulgar and indecent jokes\".\r\nThis is usually not a good selling point for anything, becausehonestly potty humor is very rarely an effective form of comedy. It is quite possible you will not find this series appealing even if you legitimately give it a try. That's fine.\\n\\n\r\nHowever if you're anything like me, you'll find the result is surprisingly entertaining and one of Gainax's best (if strangest) shows. \\n\\n\r\nThe refuge in vulgarity works fantastically, and the numerous references to western animation/movies, slick animation, awesome music, zany characters, and blatant abuse of engrish makes for a very fun experience; if you've ever played Conker's Bad Fur Day, it's very similar. it's honestly one of the most entertaining anime I have seen in a long time. In typical Gainax fashion, the ending will involve you tearing your hair out.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a very love or hate series; either you will find it fun as hell or you'll hate it and find it a disgusting waste of animation cells. I'd at least give it a try, but you should know what to expect before you watch it.",

            "content": "Out of all shows that have been presented in Fall 2010, it seems there is no show like Panty and Stocking which has so decisively split viewer opinions into clear cut groups that either believe it's the best thing that's ever happened since sliced bread, or have banished it to the depths of utter disdain. The question I ask right now and will answer in this review is if one or even both sides are justified.\r\nFirst thing that one should wonder is what this show was trying to accomplish.  I'm not a fan of Gainax, and thus I am not extremely acquainted with theirworks. However it's pretty apparent that Gainax was trying to do something that would be different.  What they have isn't a complicated or redeeming story.  Far from it. The two main characters Panty and Stocking are impulsive and obsessed with sex and sweets respectively.  That's all there is to the main characters, and that never changes throughout the show. The most development you ever see from the story or characters is in the priest Garterbelt, who is given a moderately interesting backstory in one episode complete with some decent use of dramatic and comedic elements. Outside of that, the show cannot be praised for its plot and characters alone. For the most part, the show progresses episodically more or less simply because there is a lack of a cohesive plot.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that the show is really not aiming to please its audience with traditional story elements, the main option remaining is clearly humor. Probably one of the biggest factors in creating split opinions among viewers (aside from the deliberately shallow plot) is the decision of the show to choose crude and vulgar humor as its primary form of entertainment.  Now please do not take this the wrong way.  Crude and vulgar humor alone doesn't ruin a show, but at the same time, there is in fact a right way to do it so that it actually is entertaining. The way I see it, P&S both fails and succeeds simultaneously in this department.\\n\\n\r\nThe way P&S fails at humor comes down to how at least half the time, the jokes have nothing to do with anything in the plot.  The perfect example of this is Panty's Engrish profanity.  You should be ashamed of yourself if you find it funny, because it really doesn't serve any purpose and has no relevance to anything that actually happens. A lot of extremely brief references to pop culture all around the world are made throughout the series, and they might as well not exist since again, virtually none of them have any relevance to anything that happens as Panty and Stocking are destroying things, indulging in worldly desires, playing volleyball, showing off as idols, etc.\\n\\n\r\nOn the good half of humor however, some of the show's mini plots do in fact turn out to be truly entertaining and original. Part of the originality comes through the amazing production alone. By itself, the concept of sperm soldiers on a mission to enter the womb might only raise brows at best (given that particular concept has definitely been done at least once by Family Guy as I recall, and only god knows what South Park hasn't covered), but it's the imagination of the developers that truly brings such a concept and a few others to life with vibrant colors, eye catching motions/effects, and sweated detail where it counts. P&S's art style is a bit unusual, comparable more to that of western animation as opposed to what is commonly used in anime. The almost bouncy object designs however work perfectly for this series, which tries its best to be unafraid of venturing into dangerous territory that no other group (besides Gainax presumably) would dare lay eyes upon. It's fair to say that the times that P&S does come up with something original, it is genuinely well presented.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the latter half of the series, while P&S never truly abandons trying to come up with more and more of these good and bad mini-plots, an attempt to create an actual plot direction occurs, but this is extremely brief and intermittent. This isn't to say that there was any extra legitimate plot or character development. However post-introduction of the demon sisters, the quality of action scenes goes from decent to astounding during several interactions between the conflicting angels and demons. Again, the plot and characters really can't be praised for much, but it's at least apparent that Gainax is trying, and it shows in how detailed and well scripted some of the fights become.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I feel the biggest problem with P&S is consistency.  What I believe Gainax was trying to accomplish was anything but a simple task. Being \"different\" especially in a day and age where there are uncountable records for every original concept that has ever existed is a tall order. Was Gainax trying to be funny? Were they in the end actually trying to make a new kind of story? Or were they just trolling everyone? It doesn't seem far off that they were probably going for a combination of all three, and that resulted in sacrifices in certain areas, or times where they simply just ran out of really good ideas.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, P&S does have its moments, both good and bad, and generally it will be easy for most people to focus on either the good things or the bad things, but not both. To its credit though, it is different. Ultimately I would personally look towards American sitcoms, probably South Park in particular if you're looking for something actually funny. Otherwise it is up to you to decide where your tastes lie when considering this show.",

            "content": "\"Fuck if I have a clue.\" -Panty\r\nI'm not one to normally start off a review with a quote, but from my perspective nothing summed up this show quite so perfectly. Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is the anime parody of western cartoons. To put it accurately, you take the Powerpuff Girls and cross them with South Park. The result, an amalgamation of crude humor, sex jokes, false ecchi, monsters of the week, Team Rocket, and two \"Angels\" who may just be the antithesis of angels. Allow me to say that it was fucking incredible. \r\nStory: ???\r\nYeah, I'm not really certain of how I should labelthis aspect of the show. I mean, c'mon, you read the description, what the fuck is this? How can I possibly score that? It's a bit easier to talk about it rather than apply a numerical value. The story on it's own is fairly solid, our two bitches with halos have to fight big monsters throughout the city to try and get back to heaven. The specifics have a flare of creativity about them, but the basic concept is nothing even remotely new (not that it's trying to be). I won't deny that after two or three episodes this unoriginal concept started to feel pretty damn stale. The monsters and their respective renditions of chaos certainly did not provide a reason to watch this show. This does change for a little while when the monster of the week scenario is coupled with Team Rocket's nefarious plans to enact evil upon the city, through the use of weekly monsters. I say Team Rocket but really they're just a group with the exact same dynamic as team rocket (this is a parody show). The entry of this evil trio also eventually felt stale because the question of \"what's their plan and how is it going to fail\" can only hold one's interest for so long. But ultimately, the monsters and nefarious stratagems are not why we're supposed to watch this show. \\n\r\nOh, and fuck Gainax endings. That one after-credits scene didn't happen until they decide to announce another season. I'm fairly certain that the studio was just delivering us with a pointed jab in reference to their reputation, but honestly, fuck that.... >.>\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art style is just like what we 90's kids (and older) used to watch on Saturday mornings. It sustains a cartoonish feel from the character designs to the panoramic shots of the city. The action is balls-to-the-walls and over the top with big explosions and bold faced text. What's so bloody amusing about having this art-style is the fact that this show is still an ecchi, but the art-style prevents sexual arousal in any format whatsoever. Sorry guys, you'll have to look elsewhere to get your fix. Parodying the ecchi aspect of anime by using western styles is honestly rather brilliant, but with that said, I wasn't a fan of it. Throughout the show we occasionally see an abrupt change in animation style. The only recurring instance of this is when our two Angels undergo a \"magical girl outfit change\" of sorts. The animation adopts the modern anime style and showcases the girl's removing their signature garment in a lewd fashion, all the while being next to a stripping pole. This serves as a tease of sorts to the audience with the creators taunting us by saying: \"Heh heh heh, look what you DON'T get to see.\" The reason why I disliked the cartoonish feel prevalent throughout most of the series is because I don't think it added anything. I do not believe incorporating that style was a bad-idea, this is meant to be a parody show through and through, but I would have preferred a balance between how the show was drawn. The initial fun of seeing that manner of art with the anime influence lost its charm after the first few episodes. Throw an episode of cartoon here and original there, maybe incorporate one episode meant to be like Gurren Lagann or any other anime with a distinctive method of animation.  They could have parodied other anime along with the western cartoons. Beyond the modern anime design we occasionally got art reminiscent of Transformers, South Park, and even a 1/2 episode that almost looked akin to rotoscoping (I'm not entirely sure if that was the method they used, an eye for art is not my forte).\\n\r\nThe actual quality of the art is a bit difficult for me to judge, but I am going to say it was very solid on the whole. It was simple, but I never picked up on any instances where the animation seemed choppy or distorted, the overall quality seemed consistent throughout the entirety of the 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is surprisingly awesome. I never would have imagined that this little parody could produce a genuinely good musical score. Featuring a heavy amount of electronica that blends perfectly with the feel of the show.  A few of these tracks quickly found their way into my musical library. \\n\r\nThe true standout aspect of the sound however is most definitely the English dub. At this point the dub has become rather famous, sticking true to the parody aspect, a HEAVY abundance of crude humor and profanity is draped over the dialogue. I'm not one to instantly say that swearing=humor, but in this scenario it is a concept that works beautifully. Adding in a few \"fucks\" every sentence isn't a good recipe on it's own, thankfully Funimation pulled out their A-game to present us with an excellent cast to accompany the profanity ridden dialogue. With Jaimie Marchi and Monica Rial at the helm, Cristopher Sabat as first mate, and Joel Mcdonald as the cabin boy, the respective performances of Panty, Stocking, Garterbelt, and Brief were positively stellar. The supporting cast also did fantastic as well, Cherami Leigh and Colleen Clinkenbeard as the demon sisters were particularly memorable as their haughty arrogance and composure in the face of ridiculousness provided a hilarious dichotomy. Though I do give special applause towards Monica Rial for playing Stocking. Not necessarily because her voice-work was more impressive, but rather due to the fact that Stocking is juxtaposed to nearly every other role Rial is cast in. On most occasions Rial is employed by playing the sweet and kind characters with the high pitched voice and lovable demeanor. Sure, Stocking has the high pitched voice, but when her first line is \"Fuck off! Don't talk to me till I've had my sugar!\" Damn it all, we're in for a treat. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nHaha, oh damn, these characters. To start this off let's talk about the two Angel sisters, or the two hoe-bags, hookers, cum-dumpsters, etc, etc. Just think of a derogatory name generally applied to females and these two are likely called it at some point or another. Panty and Stocking Anarchy, the two seem to be the personification of Lust and Gluttony (respectively), which is a bit ironic considering they're you know, ANGELS. Panty is the blonde, sex obsessed slut. She loves taking the spotlight and is generally more rude than her sister, employing a higher amount expletives and bearing a persona with a vast increase in crudeness. Stocking is the goth angel with an unparalleled love for sweets. She's a bit more calm than her older sister, though she is definitely capable of outbursts due to rage. She is masochistic and though no where near as addicted to sex as Panty (she prefers to be a bit of a tease), she is far from innocent. You can draw quite a few parallels between their personalities and their names. Panty who is far more outright, with removing one's panties being effect simile of an invitation for sex. And Stocking, the more tame sister with a tendency to tease, and removing one's leggings is more of a teasing aspect. A not so subtle interplay between character names, designs, and their personalities. \\n\r\nYou also have Garterbelt, the splendiferous, afro-wearing preacher that serves as the caretaker of Panty and Stocking. He's constantly annoyed and exasperated with the Sister's antics, and insulting them is their primary form of interaction. For being a preacher he's quite amoral, but when you have angels like Panty and Stocking, who the fuck knows what religion we're dealing with. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis is honestly one of the best comedy anime I have ever seen in my life. I felt like I was watching a brilliantly scripted and acted abridged series as opposed to a legitimate production. The dialogue is so foul and outrageou the entire show was a goldmine for one-liners. I'm certain that I'll have to go back and rewatch the show a few times just to ensure I didn't miss anything while laughing. The pop-culture references littered throughout the dialogue added an extra dose of hilarity as it ensured the jokes never got too stale . References like referring to the View as \"Four bitter lesbians\".  \\n\r\nIf I had to name one aspect that I didn't enjoy it would have to be the pervasive amount of toilet humor. I reach a threshold where jokes about shit, vomit, piss, and picking one's nose aren't funny (said threshold generally being one joke). I understand that the creators were taking a no-holds-barred approach, but it got stale very, very quickly. Luckily, even when these odious elements took center stage, the dialogue not pertaining to the vileness that permeated the scene salvaged the episode on the whole. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis oddball of a show is certainly deserving of a nine. You have to rate it on a certain scale, but for what it was trying to accomplish it was approaching perfection. Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is a peculiar comedy that should honestly be watched by anyone who has ever laughed at a joke from South Park.",

            "content": "So yeah, to be completely honest, this anime offends me. Not a single thing about it didnt offend me. Its so bad I felt its needed that I tell everyone that its an abomination and I cant even be nice about it. Now here comes why...\r\nStory - None, this is an episodic series with no progression in site. It follows the same plot every time, something goes wrong and it a ghost's fault so the protagonists must stop it. there's nothing beyond this format to be seen.\r\nArt - Its a poor attempt of taking Cartoon Network cartoon styles like PowerPuff Girls and throwing a bitof Japanese style in there. Its nothing new, even the pet dog, Chuck, is a rip off of GIR from Invader Zim. Green dog, black ears and a zipper, drawn somewhat differently but obviously refers to that.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The music in general is almost the best part about the series, its not totally bad at some points while others once again try to twist the nipple of western culture leaving it weeping and violated.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The characters are as one dimensional as you can get. \\n\r\nPanty - A sex crazed bitch\\n\r\nStocking - Sweets loving bitch\\n\r\nGarterbelt - their boss and a gay priest\\n\r\nChuck - a spastic non-important dog\\n\\n\r\nNone of these characters show any traits beyond this, they dont ever develop and it doesnt seem like it ever will.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - The attempt at humour was abhorrent. It attempted to use western humour and failed...miserably. It threw in at a non-stop rampage of vulgarities, sexual and bathroom humour to the point it has no meaning or general punchline. It angered me, Ive watched plenty of anime and cartoons in various genres and this series really falls out as so far the worst.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Its depressing that GAINAX had its hands in this. As a fan of their works its sad to see them spiral downwards with more and more sub-par works. This has hit rock bottom. This anime is so bad I cannot even produce a counter argument so I can show that I can be reasonable about this.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you are forced to watch it, don't.",

            "content": "Critic\u2019s Log - Earthdate: November 24, 2013. Review #69: Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt\r\nWarning: This review contains subject matter that is not appropriate for young children.\r\nNovember 23, 2013 was a very special day, Yesterday was The Day of The Doctor. It was the 50th Anniversary of the longest Science-Fiction series Doctor Who. Pffft, fuck that! *ahem* Actually, I really enjoy Doctor Who and I was just joking, But this day should also be honoring all doctors of all fields, you know\u2026 the doctors that give you your checkups to see that you are healthy. Also, let\u2019s not forget the teachers that teach high school studentsSex Education. Hold on, Teachers are not doctors. Even with what I was told in High School, I did a lot of researching. Why? Because any young adult would have. Hell, it was bound to happen after someone goes through puberty. Who am I kidding? Why the hell am I bringing this all up!? Well, this review I am about to start is an anime that\u2019s going to blow your mind without squeezing your eyeballs like popping cherries. Get ready to get turned on and aroused with Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt!\\n\\n\r\nIn a town named Daten City there is a group of ghosts that move in that are taking advantage of human greed. In Daten City there also lives Two angels (as well as sisters), Panty and Stocking, are sent from heaven to exterminate them. However ,in  reality they got kicked out for naughty behavior.\\n\\n\r\nOh dear, where do I begin? Well, this is a Studio Gainax production and this is by far their most interesting show to talk about, as random as it gets. I remembered watching how silly, manly, awesome, and badass Gurren Lagann was and I remembered how cool FLCL was. With Panty and Stocking, this is a little different. Before you say that the animation is decent, well this show will trick you right there. The animation may not look like much, but that is exactly what Gainax intended. Gainax payed homage to American animation and even some other stuff. The style is unorthodox compared to the typical anime viewing we tend to get. Panty and Stocking succeeds strongly here. The animation is inconsistent intentionally and I swear this is one of the most over the top anime that Gainax has produced. Dead Leaves is crazy, Gurren Lagann is awesome, FLCL is fun. Panty and Stocking is pretty much all of that rolled into one. Also, the explosions are fucking hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nBut the biggest highlight of the animation is the transformation sequence. Enough said. Am I the only one that thinks that Gainax really got a little too carried away with these scenes. I mean they made Panty and Stocking look pretty. fucking. hot. With a show like Panty and Stocking, Gainax sure had a lot of fun making this show and they made this show awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Taku Takahashi and TCY Crew is also pretty damn good. Like the show\u2019s nature, the soundtrack is crazy, loud, and just way too fun. Well\u2026 for the most part. The soundtrack compliments the show and it is a soundtrack worth listening to outside the show. The opening is a rare anomaly when it comes to anime. It\u2019s only 30 seconds long. As for the closing,  it\u2019s pretty nice. The highlight song is undeniably \u201cFly Away\u201d by TeddyLoid. This song kicks ass and it makes the transformation scenes or any other scene that the song is used in worth watching. This soundtrack is great and another strong factor to this show.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to voice acting, The Japanese cast is over-the-top like you would expect. Arisa Ogasawara is a blast as Panty, Mariya Ise is also great as Stocking. Kouji Ishii is hilarious as Garterbelt. Hiroyuki Yoshino plays Brief well. Yuka Komatsu and Ayumi Fujimura are great as Scanty and Kneesocks, and Shigeru Chiba is over-the-top as Corset. The Japanese cast is well-casted because of the show\u2019s nature. As with the English Dub, Jamie Marchi is a riot as Panty. Monica Rial was a huge surprise for me. If you thought she gives her characters whiny voices, Think again! That is actually her normal voice on a everyday basis, well...for the most part. Beside that, She is fucking hilarious as Stocking. As far as English Dubs go, Stocking is one of my favorite roles that Monica Rial has voiced. Chris Sabat does the voice of Garterbelt which I swear is either awkward or just too damn funny. A white guy voicing a character that is Black. I\u2019ll let you be the judge on this one. The only thing that Chris Sabat is lacking is the over-the-top quality that Ishii-san pulled off well. Even though Garterbelt is played by an Asian man and a white man. The voices are still pretty good, but I must admit\u2026 I think Kouji Ishii had the better performance. There were a couple of moments that Chris Sabat botched. The fact that he\u2019s a white guy, he does give a convincing performance in the dub. Joel McDonald is terrific as Brief. Colleen Clinkenbeard and Cherami Leigh are pretty good as Scanty and Kneesocks. Chris Ayres is okay as Corset. Know you\u2019re probably wondering why I\u2019m not mentioning Takashi Nakamura and Ian Sinclair when it comes to Chuck. That\u2019s because they don\u2019t need to do a whole lot of work with that character. Just saying. They were both good. As much as I like the Dub, I will say that the Subtitled Version has one advantage over the Dub, and that is even though the language in Japanese, most of the profanity is spoken in English\u2026Allow me to correct myself, it is spoken in ENGRISH. But even if the Subtitled Version has one advantage over the dub. I will compliment Colleen Clinkenbeard for her credit in the ADR direction and taking the liberties to stay true to the original Japanese script despite some differences in dialogue even though it\u2019s insensitive either way. It is still a Dub worth listening to, but I strongly recommend watching the Subtitled Version before or after watching the dub if you want a good laugh.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of good laughs, The characters are a riot. Panty is not the stereotypical dumb blonde. She\u2019s just very selfish, She\u2019s very rebellious, rude, easily angered, and very bitchy. She is also a sexaholic. All she cares about is finding men to fuck and she likes to help her friend \u201cPinkie Pie\u201d.Yeah, I just went there. Stocking is a complete opposite to Panty even though she has her own \u201cinterests\u201d. She likes to eat sweets (hmm, interesting), she can be just as rude when pissed off, and she compliments Panty very well when it comes to appearance, personality, etc\u2026 Garterbelt is also a great character to watch alongside Panty and Stocking. His \u201cinterests\u201d sure are interesting but not for everybody. The entire trio is a riot. Scanty and Kneesocks are pretty much Panty and Stocking\u2019s counterparts as well as archenemies. The same goes for Garterbelt\u2019s archenemy. But they compliment eachother fittingly. But here\u2019s a kicker, the main characters aren\u2019t the only fun characters, so are the episode exclusive ones as well and a couple interesting ones as well. Oh let\u2019s not forget Chuck. He is awesome, Why? Because if you remember Invader Zim and loved GIR, then you\u2019ll love Chuck.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe show has appreciative animation, the show has kickass music, the show has funny characters, and should the story be important? Pfft, fuck no! The show contains shit jokes, penis jokes, boob jokes, women jokes, men jokes, sperm jokes, weight jokes, nose-picking, vomiting, Ass-kicking action, robots, Zombies, sex toy jokes, lawyers, the Beach, relationships, Chuck, backstories, a music video, transformation scenes, Movie homages, video game homages, TV show homages, Movie title parodies, TV show title parodies, sex jokes and a bunch of other shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits that this show has offer.This show is socially insensitive, insensitive on gender, and it is religiously offensive to a certain degree, and guess what? This show does not give two fucks about all that. This show is very sporadic, yet it was done on purpose. And\u2026That\u2019s why Panty and Stocking is an awesome anime. Here\u2019s the one important kicker. This is not a Hentai anime even though it has a lot of sexual jokes and moments. There\u2019s even a few sex scenes albeit not as explicit as a Hentai anime. Let\u2019s remain mature, shall we? He he\u2026 Giggity. Anyway the show is pretty awesome in the long run. That is until\u2026\\n\\n\r\nPanty and Stocking with Garterbelt is available by Funimation.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is a crude series that was intentional since Day One. It is an awesome anime once you turn your brain off, On second thought\u2026 Let this anime fuck your brians out. The animation is appreciative, the soundtrack is bitching, the characters are out of this world, and fuck the plot. The show is not perfect, but it is still awesome.\\n\\n\r\nI give Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt a 9.2 out of 10, it is EXCELLENT!\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment, and REPENT MOTHERFUCKERS!",

Dazzling animation or a gripping story?\r\nWell Gainax definitely chose animation over everything with PSG.\r\nSTORY: It's about two fallen angels, Panty and Stocking, who got kicked out of heaven and are now trying to work their way back by defeating ghosts by using their namesake items (a pair of panties that transforms into a gun,and stocking socks that transform into swords) to combat them and to try to earn coins so they can return back, all in a episodic rate.\r\nWell that's pretty much the gist of the plot.\r\nThis is also, by the way, a comedy... a very rauchy, gross, and repeatative one infact. \\n\r\nPanty's intire joke throughout each episode is \"Oh boy am I a slut,\" that's even her character. While Stocking is a goth loli girl (Well dresses like one) who loves sweets, who doesn't seem to have anything else that would be considered interesting about her character. \\n\r\nAll Panty really does is remind you is she a total slut, and has sex in every episode. Well that is, unfortunately, the anime's signature run on joke.\\n\\n\r\nWith lots of cursing, sex jokes, and very gross situations (Panty gets literally covered in shit in the first episode, and is also a slut, in case you haven't heard me the first time, because the anime won't let you forget and neither will I) some would say this is like South Park. However South Park is actually funny and can be very smart satire (When it's not being gross or even when it's gross), award winning satire in fact, while PSG is just run on gags and gross toilet humor, it's more like a rauchier, gross, adult version of the powerpuff girls.\\n\\n\r\nThere's really nothing redeeming or creative about this anime EXCEPT-\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: -This is some of the most awe inspiring animation that even people who complain about Japan does nothing different with animation will be left with their jaws dropping to the ground, but the whole transformation pole dancing scenes (Yeah you read that right, oh yeah, Panty's also a slut) are just there to be models for obvious figurines to market off of, but does feature incredible animation for said scenes. \\n\r\nAnd when Panty and Stocking defeat a ghost, it does a live action sequence where a model of the ghost gets blown up, which only adds to uniqueness of the animation direction. \\n\r\nVery gutsy and highly experimental animation, though many will be turned off by it, more will be turned off by it's so called plot.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Very catchy background music and a great ending theme song. \\n\r\nThe opening theme though, I found it annoying to say the least. \\n\r\nThough it was amusing to hear the characters swear in english, the dialogue is highly offensive and can be just as gross as it's subject matter.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Great Animation, something totally bizarre yet inspiring.\\n\r\n+ Catchy Music, specifically the ending theme song.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Repetitive comedy that only rely on low brow humor.\\n\r\n- Very gross, The first episode alone is disgusting.\\n\r\n- Story?\\n\r\n- Highly Offensive to all audiences.\\n\\n\r\nPSG, is the amazing animation and catchy music worth it to keep people watching? For me, no way in hell (Though I can see myself visiting it again, oh yeah and reminder: Panty's a slut), but this is something that will definitely get a cult following for sure.\\n\r\nThe story and comedy are uninspiring and annoyingly repetitive, and is quite disappointing from the same studio who produced FLCL, Gurren Lagann, and Neon Genesis Evangelion, but this is (surprisingly) something I would reccomend anyone to check out for the animation alone and ultimately let you decide if it's worth your time or not.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nThere are certain opinions that are accepted on MAL, and certain opinions that stir up lots of anger. Certain anime series can't be praised and others can't be criticized without creating an absolute hailstorm of \"unhelpfuls\". I don't mean to come across as a mean spirited contrarian and kick any sacred cows, but I have to be honest. This is one of my least favorite anime comedy series. I don't think I laughed once the entire time. That's an accomplishment! I'm pretty easy to make laugh. YES, I understand that the director intended the series to parody the crass stupidity of American comedy and showwhat American comedy feels like to a Japanese audience. The problem is that this is NOT a good parody/spoof of American stupidity. It is just a very lazy and totally ineffectual copy of it. Mike Judge's Idiocracy with the short \"film\" OW My Balls! was a parody. Panty and Stocking is just like watching a bottom 50% episode of Family Guy or a bottom 10% episode of South Park where Trey and Matt are really off their game that week. I don't actually hate Hiroyuki Imaishi and I KNOW that he can do better, but this series simply wasn't one of his best efforts.\\n\\n\r\nPlot and character: 2/10: \\n\\n\r\nThere is no real engaging plot obviously. The basic premise is that 2 naughty girl angels get kicked out of Heaven and must use lingerie items as weapons in order to fight ghosts and eventually buy their way back into heaven with the requisite number of award points. To be frank, the plot to Ren and Stimpy was better than this! Panty and Stocking is highly episodic in nature and each episode is as painfully unfunny as the last. The characters are insanely obnoxious, unfunny, and have none of the appeal of the characters in South Park, Family Guy, or any of the shows that this allegedly is spoofing. This is NOT coming from someone who thinks Family Guy is a well written show BTW. I HATE Family Guy! I just happen to hate Panty and Stocking a LOT more. Why? Because Family Guy can on very rare occasion still make me laugh, unlike this giant shit monster! Did anyone else think the Giant Shit Monster in episode 1 was an allusion to the show itself? The thought certainly crossed MY mind.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually pretty decent. It is a long way from the best Gainax is capable of, but it is clearly the highlight of the series for what its worth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are few things in life worse than sitting through a comedy that's extremely unfunny. This is like watching a version of \"Meet the Spartans\" that lasts for 6 hours!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nSo what could this series have done differently? Could it have been saved and remade to actually be funny? The answer to this previous question is YES! Panty and Stocking has plenty of potential, but it was highly flawed in its execution. Firstly, the 2 main characters are simply WAY too annoying. It is acceptable to have a comedy with a fairly annoying protagonist, but there is a certain line in the sand where once you cross it, the comedy becomes un-watchable. This is why nobody liked The Love Guru, Freddy Got Fingered, or Biodome. If the characters just grate on your every nerve, 100% of the time they are on screen, it stops being funny and starts becoming an absolute chore to watch. Secondly, Panty and Stocking really needed to better develop its own sense of humor, more like Imaishi's other works Gurren Lagann and Inferno Cop. There is a difference between \"homage\", \"spoof\", and lazy ripoff. This felt like a lazy ripoff. Lastly, Imaishi's high energy absurdist humor can quickly begin to wear on the viewer's nerves. Much like Seth McFarland's style of comedy, it can be decent in small doses and VERY annoying in large doses. Panty and Stocking would have massively benefited from having much shorter episodes in the style of Imaishi's later work Inferno Cop.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: If you want a goofy Hiroyuki Imaishi anime, please skip this one and go watch Inferno Cop instead. You will be very glad you did!",

            "content": "WARNING: This review contains mature language and content that may not be acceptable for all readers. \r\nPanty and Stocking is a unique anime in the sense that in not only has some of the fastest jokes I've ever seen in an anime, but this is the dirtiest, sluttiest, grossist, most foul mouthed anime I've ever seen, including hentai!!!\r\nStory: The story is your basic monster-of-the-week story with Panty and Stocking fighting a different ghost in each episode and each ghost having his own unique powers. However, I will point out that because this is such a short anime, the episodical nature of the story doesn't wearyou down as much as it would for animes with 100 episodes or more.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I don't want to spoil anything, but by the final episodes the story gets much more climatic and you have to keep watching to the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I can describe Panty and Stocking in one word, \"bitches\". If you search the words \"Angel + Bitch\", Panty and Stocking will be the first things to pop-up. However, I love Panty and Stocking because they're bitches! I love watching them argue, I love watching them neglecting their responsibilities, I love watching Stocking eat sugar and Panty hump every man that walks down the street. I can't explain it, but if Panty and Stocking actually behaved like angels this anime wouldn't be anywhere near as good!\\n\\n\r\nI also love the side characters. I love watching Garterbelt scream at Panty and Stocking for not doing their jobs, I love how Brief is so hopelessly in love with Panty, and Panty and Stocking's enemies, Skanty and Kneesocks, I love them too because they're the complete opposite of Panty and Stocking as in they're both behaved, polite, intelligent, and demonic.\\n\\n\r\nI would've liked this anime more if it was a slice-of-life instead of action. My favorite episode of the anime is when Panty and Stocking just spend the whole episode just hanging out in their living room eating junk food and watching TV. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the one thing I didn't like about this anime was the gross-out humor. Panty and Stocking fight a ghost made of poop, a ghost made of snot, a ghost made of sperm, a ghost made of vomit, a ghost that ate people's underwear, and a ghost that shot milk from her boobs. That was too over the top for my taste :(\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you are at least 17 years old, then watch this anime immediately! It was funny and it had great unforgettable characters! Also, make sure you keep watching to the end because the ending is amazing! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Gainax decides to take on Western media and produces some interesting results.\r\nAs always, my reviews are spoiler free.\r\nStory - 3/10\r\nPanty and Stocking, a pair of angel sisters are rejected from heaven due to their questionable natures.  In order to get back in, they must kill ghosts to collect heaven coins.  It seems like a pretty simple story, and that's because it is; each episode (with a few exceptions) is divided into two halves, each killing a ghost wreaking some sort of havoc in the city.  This havoc is usually directly involved with some sort of crude humor (the tissue factory has beentaken over so men can't \"relieve their frustrations, all of the city's sewer waste has been possessed, etc.).  Panty and Stocking will show up and, with an interesting incantation and poll-dancing mahou shoujo transformation sequence, destroy the ghost with their weapons made out of their... panties and stockings.  There really isn't so much fighting as their are one liners.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is a comedy anime, but not the average one.  It relies almost entirely on dirty jokes, which can get old pretty quickly.  On the other side of the heaven coin, however, there are many witty scenes and parodies to appreciate.  A favorite of mine was sperm soldiers assaulting a beach with a certain \"mound\" being their final goal.  Therefore, we have a mixed bag of stale sex and bathroom humor and relatively thoughtful parody, although the former certainly dominates the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is totally different from any other anime I have seen.  Many say it is like South Park, but I would say it looks much closer to cartoons like Invader Zim.  It is likely going to be a very polarizing factor, but I liked it.  They will occasionally change the art style to a more traditional anime or chibi style for various purposes (meaning sex appeal or comedy).  Overall, I liked the change of pace, with a nice color pallet and comic book sound effects written into the backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you enjoy the humor or animation of the show, most people would agree that the soundtrack for this show is superb.  I want to also mention in this section that the dub would be far superior to native English speakers.  I found the Japanese audio with subtitles to be totally unfunny, but the banter between Panty and Stocking is much more entertaining in English, profanity and all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nPanty, Stocking, and Garterbelt are not particularly good characters in their own right.  However, when they are combined together, the situations they get themselves into can prompt some hilarious dialog.  The arguments between the sisters are brutal but funny, and Garterbelt's attempts to keep the two in check never go as planned.  Each of the characters has a few overarching personality traits.  Panty is completely sex crazed (her goaling being to sleep with 1000 men on earth before returning to heaven) and lazy in her ghost killing duties.  Stocking's adoration for sweets is unbelievable, but she is the more serious of the two in both daily life and ghost killing.  While she is not a total whore like Panty, she shows strange interest in the opposite sex and is into some exotic bedroom activities, like bondage and electrocution.  Garterbelt doesn't act like the priest he is in any way, other than the stereotype of enjoying... younger company.  Together, they make a good comedy trio.  The other characters are essentially useless.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5?/10\\n\\n\r\nHow much you enjoy this show will depend entirely on how much you like the characters and if you like the crude humor.  I liked the characters, but not so much the humor.  \\n\\n\r\nOther Thoughts\\n\\n\r\n-You will probably like this show if you enjoy Western cartoon aimed towards adults.  \\n\r\n-It contains a large amount of crude humor, foul language, and sexual themes.\\n\r\n-Watch the dub (another strange exception to my Japanese language preference).",

            "content": "Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt is the most obscene, vulgar, and over the top anime that I\u2019ve ever seen. That is what makes this series so unique and enjoyable. It does, and says things that you\u2019d never expect to see in an anime, and it does it all really well. But with that said, Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt is not without its problems.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story in this series revolves around the Anarchy sisters, Panty and Stocking. They are angels that got kicked out of heaven because couldn\u2019t follow the rules. A handler named Garterbelt accompanies them on their mission to obtain the currency of heavencalled Heaven Coins. Their goal is to collect enough Heaven Coins to buy there way back into heaven, but the only way to obtain the coins is by killing ghosts. The story of this series is really difficult to judge. Not only because the actual plot of the anime is very simple and straightforward, but also because it is comedy series. And not just any comedy series, but it\u2019s a parody comedy series. Each episode is named after a movie or television series. Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt will take elements and ideas from those shows and movies, and implement them into the episodes. They chose from a variety of different types of series\u2019, from High School Musical, to Night of the Living Dead. If you\u2019ve seen the particular show or movie, it makes the episode that much more funny to watch. But that\u2019s not the only reason I considered it a parody. The series could be taken just as an anime portrayal or parody of the western animation style and humor, but it\u2019s a little deeper than that. This series also juxtaposes several elements and themes throughout the series. From angels that aren\u2019t very angelic, to demons that aren\u2019t incredibly demonic. The animation itself is in contrast to the themes of the show. While this series is animated like something you\u2019d see on the Cartoon Network on Saturday mornings, the language and themes used in the series are far from kid friendly. Even with a plot that isn\u2019t incredibly original or complex, the comedy, and contrast that the show provides makes it extremely interesting and engaging. With all of that said, the ending of the story was terrible. The story had flowed very nicely and was on the road to a satisfying conclusion, but at the last minute they decided to ruin it by throwing in a cliffhanger as a tease for the next season. And since, to my knowledge, there is no news about the second season, there will probably never be any sort of resolution for the gigantic curve ball they threw us at the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this series is obviously inspired by American animation, and it is really well done. The animation reminds me of shows that I would watch on Saturday mornings when I younger. While the style isn\u2019t what you would typically see in an anime, it really fits this series well. The characters and backgrounds are both animated really well, but the best parts of the animation are the fight scenes. Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt was produced by Gainax, the same studio that produced Gurren Lagann, so it\u2019s safe to say that they are used producing some crazy and over the top action scenes. They also mix in some more traditional anime style animation, as well as live action explosions at the end of each battle, which adds to the comedic effect of the show. The entire series is all really well animated and entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this series is excellent. It\u2019s definitely something that I\u2019ve never heard in an anime before. It\u2019s a mixture of dance and electronic, which are two genres of music that I\u2019ve never really listened to. This show served as a good introduction to those genres of music, and I really enjoyed it. The music also really fits the overall style of the show, as well as the tone and atmosphere of the scenes where they are used. The opening and ending are both really well done. They both are catchy, and really enjoyable to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis series has four main characters. Panty, a sex addict who is able to transform her panties into ghost slaying pistols, Stocking, Panty\u2019s sister, who has a serious love of anything sweet, and can transform her stockings into swords, their handler, Garterbelt, who is a priest with a violent past and questionable interests, and Briefers, a want-a-be ghost hunter who has a crush on Panty. Instead of giving these characters a lot of development, this series gives them all lots of personality. The characters are all very funny and likable. The way the characters interact with each other is hilarious, and very fun to watch. There are several side and supporting characters, but most of them are only in one or two episodes. The ones that show up multiple times also have lots of personality and are very fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nPanty & Stocking with Garterbelt was a breath of fresh air for the comedy anime genre, and I really enjoyed watching it. It isn\u2019t trying to be anything really deep, or thought provoking; it\u2019s just pure entertainment. Even though it wasn\u2019t anything spectacular, the way it contrasted several different things in the series did give me something to think about while I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict & Breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3.2/5\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/5\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4.4/5\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3.5/5\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3.8/5\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 3.8/5\\n\\n\r\nPanty & Stocking with Garterbelt isn\u2019t for everyone, but if you can tolerate ridiculous amounts of vulgarity, sexual jokes, a story that isn\u2019t serious, you should definitely give this series a try.",

            "content": "Now, Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is not your typical anime.  This is one of the most profane and dirty shows I haved watched probably in my entire lifetime, but you know what, it works.  Panty and Stocking is one of those shows you're uncomfortable with watching at first, but then you just accept the fact that you're watching something of its caliber.  Gainax, you truly know how to experiment.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nNow I know I shouldn't be expecting much from a comedy show, and I didn't going in.  Every episode is a new little story that tells us of the coarse adventuresthat Panty and Stocking go on regularly.  Now there are recurring plot points (I mean if you could even call them that) that pop up here and then.  For example, starting with episode 6, the two demon sisters, Scanty and Kneesocks, make appearances here and there in future episodes.  By episode 12, we get a new plotpoint where Corset, the mayor of the city, wants the find Hell's monkey, whose key is in the form of Brief's genitalia.  This key basically releases the forces of hell itself onto earth and whatnot, but I don't want to get into too much details.  It was trying to aim for I guess a half decent plot at the end, but what I'm I saying?  We are dealing with the studio infamous for bad endings.  Who knows if we'll ever see a P&S season 2?\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\n\"Oh the nerve!\" You're probably thinking as you type away furiously at the keyboard.  \"This art is awful! How could you give it anything higher than mediocrity!\"  Well kind sir, I'll tell ya.  Gainax was trying to make it have an American type artwork.  I mean, this show is far from Japanese, I assure you.  It parodies a lot of different artwork in the show like the old G1 Transformers, Southpark, and the very Powerpuff Girls style that is prevalent throughout the show.  It depicts a popular view of what the Japanese think of our culture.  Now I know it's not the most appealing to the eyes, and that's why I'm not giving it masterpiece status.  When going into this show, try to understand what they were going for, and above all pay attention more to the humor than the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nStarting with the intro, I think it brings a nice atmosphere to what this show is about to unravel for your little mind: sex, profanity, and much more.  It's simple lyrics and flashy colors bring you into the moment, for what you're about to experience is something you have never seen before in an anime.  The ending credits is a nice serene and catchy song that kept me from skipping it at the end of the episode.  Now this is coming from a guy who will skip any end outro just from hearing a couple seconds from it.  So this was a nice change of pace.  The songs within the show could be hit or miss.  One song will have you listen to the very promiscuous sounds of a girl moaning, and really no other song really stood out to me.  I'd say definitely my favorite of the bunch was the song that played during P&S's transformation scene, \"Fly Away.\"  A very catchy song that fit the two angels to a tee.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10 \\n\r\nThe characters in this show were great.  I wanna say I enjoyed every single character in the show.  By far, my favorite was Garterbelt.  I mean who doesn't love a big black preacher who has the Lord in his heart, but still swears like a sailor and is into bondage.  I know I did.  Between the two sisters, I think Panty wins by just a minimal amount.  A sex obsessed angel who's not afraid to get down to business when the time comes, she definitely proves to get my vote between these two characters.  Nothing against Stocking, I just think she was a bit underplayed.  Most of the shine went towards Panty, and when Stocking did get screen-time it was only for a short amount of time before Panty started to do her thing.  The two sisters were a nice add-on to the rest of the series and proved to be just as good of characters as P&S.  Brief, well, he's just kinda there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI didn't know too much about what I was getting myself into, until I was finally into it.  I thoroughly enjoyed this show and found myself laughing at many of the inappropriate moments in the episodes.  This was a treat to myself considering it broke the usual norms of an anime and gave me something a little more fresh this summer.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 8/10\\n\r\nDefinitely check out this show if you haven't already.  You won't regret the time you put into watching this hilarity.  It's only 13 episodes, so you don't have much to lose, am I right? This is one of those shows to watch with friends just to get a kick out of all the sex jokes ans so forth.  Oh and keep this far away from your parents, trust me.  You'll thank me later.\\n\\n\r\nHave a wondrous day.",

            "content": "You think you\u2019ve seen everything in entertainment that would make you wide eyed in disbelief in its various forms of hedonism and debauchery? I\u2019ve got one show for you to feast your eyes on and, to no surprise, it is thanks to Gainax,  by the lead people who were responsible for Gurren Lagann unsurprisingly. The name of this title is Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. Now if you think I use the terms hedonism and debauchery in any negative fashion, trust me when I say, it molds those two things into one glorious package.\r\nA way to describe Panty and Stocking in a nutshell isto think of the show as Japan\u2019s answer to western animated TV shows, particularly in America. They are open about it right to the aesthetics of the animation and art style it encompasses that feel right at home to some of Gainax\u2019s more wackier creations. Directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi, creator of the aforementioned Gurren Lagann and Kill La Kill, he has once again managed to pull off more of his balls out creativity with Panty and Stocking. The imaginative process that he most likely had in mind for Panty and Stocking would be, \u201cWhat if I made a sexual and vulgar version of a Looney Tunes cartoon?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIf you were to watch it all verbatim, there are some influences of those cartoons in terms of how the humor is displayed in its pacing and visuals. Jokes that involve, say, having sex with multiple guys at once, abortion, strippers, masturbation, gluttony, and toilet humor aren\u2019t exactly for the faint of heart. Fast-paced animation fits very well with that style of humor because of the overall nature to those aspects all combined together. Especially since the humor is generally featuring slapstick antics between characters. With Panty and Stocking, it manages to make most of the jokes work without having them rely on redundant situations each episodes. They all depend on the racy writing and how they intertwine them with witty charisma from our two main protagonists and the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nI would start by analyzing the plot of Panty and Stocking as I do with every review, but what plot is there to be given this treatment? This is, by and large, an episodic formula that mostly follows among two parts each episode that follow a specific type of theme. There\u2019s not much in terms of character growth for Panty or Stocking, but it is, in essence, a show that wants to be up-in-your-face with its attempts at being crazy and nonsensical. Normally this would serve as a problem if the comedy only works half the time, yet Panty and Stocking manages to prove itself exceptional to this rule. I\u2019ve already mentioned in detail how great the humor works and it does not skip a lot of beats in keeping them feeling fresh. Hell, there is one plot arc that just involves Panty and Stocking sitting on a couch doing nothing but going about their day. No extreme battles take place, no nothing, and it managed to still be delightfully humorous as the rest considering that it\u2019s so different in tone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters range from the painfully awkward and downright insane in the personality range. Either way, most of them possess many qualities from their personalities to make them lovable, at least with our two main ladies. That is not to say the rest are mediocre by any stretch but they are not as attention-grabbing visually or verbally speaking. Garterbelt is still good from his pretty funny attempts at trying to keep both Panty and Stocking in check from having too much fun from their respective duties. The \u201cnerd\u201d of the cast, Rock Briefers, is funny on occasion, especially with one moment involving him on a toilet. Numerous side characters crop up from every direction and fill in their roles with the amount of screentime they are needed.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the main dish of the course, Panty and Stocking, the girls themselves, that is. They embody the entirety of what makes the show phenomenal from beginning to end. Their constant barrage of quick and snappy dialogue are always a splendor to experience. Excess in sexual body fluids and constantly berating each other for their physical appearance are but a few that these two have to offer. Even with the moments that might make them, in hindsight, unlikable from the context of their actions, they still invoke stellar charm in their chemistry. What is also noticeably poignant to them is their voice actresses, which I would argue are great both in the English and Japanese dubbed tracks.\\n\\n\r\nAfter mentioning how the art and animation helps the humor by themselves, they are very unique compared to what most anime studios generally draw. I also like how it\u2019ll sometimes morph characters into different sizes based on what is happening at that particular moment. Sometimes they are small and chibi and sexually drawn in a realistic fashion when they do that striptease transformation sequence. Making it have a multifaceted look lets Panty and Stocking feel special in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nTo say that Panty and Stocking shows no boundaries is an understatement at the utmost highest level. Anyone with the tolerance levels of vulgarity at the lowest level possible would most likely drop the show from the very first minute of it. With the lengths it goes to shock people, it is hard to not admire it for doing so. Many conceive comedy to have the tendency to go far with its material and delve deeper to the point where it almost makes the audience uncomfortable, which makes a good comedy a brilliant one. The only thing that keeps Panty and Stocking from being perfect is that it didn\u2019t go far enough.",

If you haven't remember or paid attention to the details of it, it's very much no connecting story for every episode; as each episode had its own scenario for itself, and did not drag on. This is the purpose of Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt, except it's not for the kids anymore. So yes, your cartoons as a kid, did finally grow up along with you.\r\nTo be forewarned, Panty and Stocking are not for the faint of heart, or even the intelligent. As GAINAX is clearly making the point that this is clearlya man's anime, it does have a manly intellect behind it. Violence, sex, sexy characters, bad language, humor, and no confusing storyline to have you needing a score card to keep track of the events. If you even object to any of the mentioned, you might want to reconsider watching this series, because it contains a massive amounts of the mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nThis is, overall, the best anime I have seen for 2010. I can finally now enjoy watching something that is themed around the same direction as the cartoons from my childhood, except since I'm older, the content is older as well.

            "content": "Warning:  this review contains some foul language.  If you can't handle that, then this review is over...  don't watch Panty and Stocking.\r\nPanty and Stocking with Garterbelt... A title I\u2019m going to shorten from this point on... Is a show about two angels who\u2019ve been expelled from heaven, and must destroy ghosts in order to be accepted back through the pearly gates. They follow the lead of a mysterious black priest named Garterbelt, who shelters them, manages them, and aids them in finding their targets. However, now that they\u2019re living new lives as mortals, what will be more important to them... Their questto return to their old home, or the vices and sinful pleasures of their new home?\\n\\n\r\nOur central character is Panty Anarchy, the older of the two sisters. She\u2019s obsessed with sex, and has become addicted to the feeling of human intercourse. Her weapon, appropriately, is a pair of panties that can turn into an angelic gun. Her little sister is Stocking Anarchy, who has become obsessed with sugary sweets, which she consumes almost as voraciously as Panty consumes men. They\u2019re both greedy, selfish, arrogant, basically the exact opposite of how you\u2019d expect an angel to act.\\n\\n\r\nThey have a dog named Chuck, who is constantly abused, thereby justifying his existence. They also obtain a sidekick named Brief, an introverted virgin boy who acts as the group\u2019s moral center, to absolutely no avail. Their manager, Garterbelt, is a priest, and... Do I really need to explain him any further than that?\\n\\n\r\nTheir archenemies, Scanty and Kneesock, are a pair of demonic sisters, who oddly act like the exact opposite of our heroes... Stuck up, reserved, dignified, but just as selfish and arrogant.\\n\\n\r\nSo, hearing this plot description, you\u2019re probably thinking that a bunch of bored, overworked middle-aged men must have come up with this scenario via committee while drunk off their asses. And if you\u2019re thinking that, well... Yes. That\u2019s exactly what this is, and that\u2019s exactly what happened.\\n\\n\r\nThe Gainax team took a well deserved vacation after they wrapped their work on Gurren Lagann, they all came up with this gem while drinking together. The plot, the characters, and almost every other detail was cooked up by people too wasted to cook, and yes, that includes the art style and tone.\\n\\n\r\nLike all alcohol fuelled get-togethers, the conversation inevitably diverted towards dirty jokes and adult humor, which they of course decided would be the focus of the show. They committed themselves to it, and if nothing else, you have to admire their tenacity. Panty and Stocking is vulgar all the way through, containing more fucks and shits than any televised show could be expected to have. They used these words in English to get them past the Japanese censors, but even without the foul language, there are entire episodes devoted to sex, bodily fluids, and often both.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for those of you who\u2019ve gotten this far into the review while thinking the material may be tastefully done, think again... Taste, as it turns out, is the one word that seems to have been banned from the script. Unless of course Panty\u2019s complaining that her food would taste better with some jizz on it.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an episode where they fight a shit ghost... One where they fight a puke ghost... There\u2019s a nose picking ghost who they have to fight with their nosebleeds... And yet the only episode that ever offended me was the one where they have to fight a platoon of sperm ghosts who died storming the beaches of vaginal Normandy. Don\u2019t blame me for being offended, I have a Grandpa who fought in that war.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this approach isn\u2019t the fact that it\u2019s offensive... It\u2019s that it isn\u2019t funny. The humor relies entirely on shocking you, but it doesn\u2019t take long for that shock to wear off, and the content on screen to become... Well, dull, if you can believe it. And since the actual writing is bare bones and lazy at best, that shock value is really the only thing it has to try and keep you engaged with.\\n\\n\r\nWell, almost. There\u2019s also the art style, which is based primarily on the work of Genndy Tartakovsky. Think outlines, bright colors, consistent angles, and character designs that could almost trick you into thinking it was flash animated. And that\u2019s not the only western property that Panty and Stocking touches on... The references to western culture are constant and merciless, with America as it\u2019s favorite plaything. There are entire episodes playing around with Romero movies, Michael Bay\u2019s Transformers reboot, and even a late nod towards X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Episode titles will be puns on American movies, even when the episode itself has nothing to do with said movie.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime that tries it\u2019s damnedest to inspire cries of \u2018What the Fuck,\u2019 the only WTF question it really deserves to be asked is \u2018Why the Fuck?\u201d It isn\u2019t so much \u2018What the Fuck are they doing, it\u2019s \u2018Why the Fuck are They Doing It?\u2019 As well as, \u2018What the Fuck Were They Trying to Accomplish?\u2019 And the answer, I believe, comes back to Excel Saga.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to believe one of those Gainax executives was an Excel Saga fan. Because this show reeks of Excel Saga.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, take a look at the similarities. You have two eccentric heroines, a blonde-haired extrovert and a blue-haired introvert with larger breasts (Excel and Hyatt) who work for a mysterious individual who\u2019s constantly assigning them bizarre missions (Il Palazzo), and they have an abnormal dog who\u2019s always in constant danger (Menchi, although he looks like Gir), and they eventually take on a third member who has trouble fitting in with them as they consistently get abused... And come from a surprisingly affluent background... (El Gala, for those of you who read the manga). And they have to battle an opposing syndicate lead by a corrupt mayor(OH FUCKING COME ON!). The difference is that instead of being well-meaning girls who are out to conquer the city, we have self-serving girls who are out to save the city.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this blatantly obvious... Um, we\u2019ll call it an influence... Isn\u2019t always a bad thing. I may criticize it for probably stealing it\u2019s basic plot structure from Excel Saga, but if there\u2019s one thing I can give it credit for, it\u2019s for successfully stealing it\u2019s bold, experimental tone as well. Excel Saga was a blank slate anime that used every episode to do something entirely different, depending on the whims of it\u2019s creators. It would drive it\u2019s unique characters through absurd situations on some days, and lampoon the crap out of another series/genre on the other day. Panty and Stocking is the only anime I can think of that was able to steal this tone, and make it their own.\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned before, I have no ear for Anime music. But I loved this anime\u2019s music. There\u2019s a lot of electronic music in this title, and while I don\u2019t know enough about electronic music to describe it very well at all, I can say that I found it very enjoyable. Even the autotuned tracks... And there are many... Are ridiculously catchy. But the highlight, for me, was the ending theme, an entirely english song called Fallen Angel. I\u2019ll let the song speak for itself, but I honestly can\u2019t see any other song working as well when placed in the background of an ending video that features chibi bobbleheads in a number of perilous situations. The result is just... Adorkable. A word I don\u2019t even like.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, we have the English dub. Good lord, do we have the English dub.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub takes the vulgarity of the series, as well as the pop culture references, and cranks them up to eleven. And after hearing how much Jamie Marchi enjoys reading her extra-perverse lines, it doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that she\u2019s the one who wrote the damn thing. Mostly.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I love Jamie Marchi as an actor... For the record, I think the majority of her performances are fun and full of life... I\u2019ve never liked her as a script writer. I think she\u2019s one of those rare writers whose quality declines if she\u2019s given too much freedom with it. I already talked about her in my Yamada\u2019s first Time reviews, calling her one of the most try-hardiest writers in the anime genre, and with the amount of dirty jokes and movie quotes she managed to jam into this dub, I can imagine her primary tool being not a pen, but a crowbar. although the engrish swearing in the sub was pretty damn funny, I only laughed about a dozen times while watching the dub... Which consists of thirteen episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe casting is perfect, the actors do their best, but in the end, no amount of sincerity can make it sound like anything other than suppressed writers laughing at their own jokes. you simply can\u2019t saver writing that\u2019s this bad.\\n\\n\r\nAll vulgarity and no wit makes Panty and Stocking a dull boy.\\n\\n\r\nOh, while we\u2019re on the subject of the dub, this one kills me as a voice-chaser, as it\u2019s a prime example of Cherami Leigh mimicking Luci Christian\u2019s voice.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I fail to appreciate this anime as a comedy, I actually really respect it from an artistic perspective, and i\u2019m not just talking about the addictive art and animation style. By following Excel Saga\u2019s experimental example, Panty and Stocking makes room for some surprisingly bold artistic decisions. The art style becomes hyper-realistic during the puke episode, a brief change that will leave many first time viewers wondering if they\u2019ve wandered into a different show. There\u2019s an entire episode done in one continuous shot, save for some time skips. And my favorite episode of all is Chuck to the Future, an episode where the dog Chuck goes through what can only be called a David Lynch style story, told through barely any dialogue, as he battles his arch-nemesis Fastener. And since they had time left over after this segment, the writers just said \u201cFuck it,\u201d and did a music video that parodies a huge chunk of the western popular music scene.\\n\\n\r\nBut that loose style also carries a huge drawback. The thing I hate the most about this show is that it knows how plotless and irrelevant it is, and by coating itself in a thick shell of non-existent fucks, it safeguards itself from criticism. you can\u2019t ask why the writing is so bad, because it\u2019s Panty and Stocking. You can\u2019t ask why there\u2019s so much about it that doesn\u2019t make any sense, because it\u2019s Panty and Stocking. You can\u2019t bring any arguments about consistency, logic, continuity, or character development because it\u2019s fucking Panty and Stocking!\\n\\n\r\nOne of the creators has cited Drawn Together(and other adult cartoons) as a primary inspiration for the vulgarity and overall tone this show, but considering how little fucks it gives about it\u2019s own presentation, I\u2019d be a little quicker to finger Tom Green as it\u2019s inspiration. It doesn\u2019t try to give us anything more than whatever the fuck it wants to give us, and in doing so, it can\u2019t possibly fail. And in a weird way, as much I hate this, I can actually kind of respect it.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and there\u2019s also an eight minute OVA called Sanitarybox, but it\u2019s entirely pointless, and if you don\u2019t want to think about discarded foreskins every time you eat a Funion, don\u2019t even bother with it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Panty and Stocking will be different things to different people. Some of us will find it hilarious, some of us will find it an intriguing art piece, and some of us will just roll our eyes and be alienated the entire time. As far as i\u2019m concerned, these are all valid reactions to one of the most original anime shows to come out in the last decade. It looks great, despite it\u2019s best efforts, and it sounds great, also despite it\u2019s best efforts, and even if you can\u2019t call it enjoyable, if nothing else, you can at least call it unforgettable.\\n\\n\r\nI give Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt a 6/10.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "ah Panty & Stocking, probably one of the most controversial shows from Gainax in quite a while, and since they made good ol' Evangelion, that's saying quite a bit. P&SwG at heart is a love-letter/parody/pastiche/you name it/ to/of Western pop culture. Filled to the brim with toilet humor, references, asinine plot elements and even more inane characters, it's like I sat down to watch some animu and ended up watching something on Adult Swim/Comedy Central. Is it a show everyone can enjoy? Definitely not, it's pretty  much cut right down in the middle between lovers: people who absolutely adore it and everything it standsfor, and haters; people who wonder how this show even managed to crawl its way out of the depraved minds of the people who thought this insanity up. Will you enjoy it? You can probably just watch the first 2 minutes or so of the first episode and decide whether its an anime for you or not. Unlike many other shows, Panty & Stocking won't win over the people who didn't like it in the later episodes, but at the same time it will not alienate the people who originally liked it when it started up. It doesn't make any compromises and sticks to its guns through thick and thin. Still it's not possible to write off all the flaws simply because its different, nor is it possible to write off the show entirely for its presentation. It can be looked at through an *GASP* objective point of view despite being absurdity-incarnate.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the art and animation. It's been stated maaany times before, but the art is a fusion of the classic PowerPuff Girls and Dead Leaves with a tinge of South Park thrown in for good measure. The result? A wildly memorable art design and a slick sense of style. Yes they look like something out of a Western cartoon but that's definitely not a bad thing in my book, rather it makes the whole thing stick out from the rest of the generic shit that gets pumped out year after year. Gainax being the enormous fanboys of Western culture as they are, shamelessly throw in god-knows how many references to cartoons such as Courage the Cowardly Dog, Samurai Jack and even Ren & Stimpy. In this regard, I'd consider PSG to be quite the innovation at least in its art and content, something that hasn't been seen in Japan since well.....ever. Not that its the first of its kind, Dead Leaves had tread this ground years ago, and Gainax has always been doing wacked out stuff for as long as its been in the business. Nevertheless, PSG still manages to be fresh and bold with its simplistic and outrageous artstyle. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation...oh lord where to begin...\\n\\n\r\nI can imagine it now, right when Hiroyuki Imaishi had the brain fart that created this travesty. He rounded up all of the giants among Gainax's in-house animators and proposed to them PSG's premise and let them off their leashes. Yup, similar to Parallel Works, we've had just about every notable animator over at Gainax giving their shot at PSG, even getting some notable freelancers such Ryotimo and Hironori Tananka to do some directing and animating. Basically they all got together, circle-jerked onto some paper and called it animation. The result is JEEBUS CUHRISHT GLORIOUS!!!!!111!!1! Easily some of the most colorful, high-frame, excellently directed and cut animation I've seen all year. Half the freaking hype for this show came from the sakugafags who were frothing at the mouth just thinking about the prospective animation staff for the next episode. I take my hat off to Gainax, they really do a good job with the animation and never fail to disappoint in this category in their original works. A special note for the CGI work that was done, especially in episodes 6, 10 and 13. Its the single most impressive implementation of 3D with 2D animation I've ever seen. Obviously Gainax is known to work some magic with 3D animation but they really outdid themselves here. I didn't even notice how many of the car-on-car action scenes were 3D until someone pointed it out, it's THAT good! The only other anime I can think of that has animators going crazy this year is probably Tatami Galaxy (another great anime worth checking out).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound needs no real praise from me since its been universally praised to hell and back. I'm jumping on the bandwagon and saying that its equally as excellent as the visual design. All the tracks that get played are memorable and that's definitely something worth commending. The techno is FABULOUS~ and really accentuate the whimsical nature of the show. All the tracks are overflowing with energy, hell I catch myself singing some of songs under my breath everyone now and then. The OST comes out on the 29th, so get your wallets/piratin into gear, it'll be one helluva an OST to remember. Fly away now~, Fly away now~, FLY AWAY!~\\n\r\nOn a similar note, all the voice actors/actresses did a terrific job with the script (or lack of). What I really enjoyed is the fact that Panty & Stocking themselves had very unique voices despite me having heard the same VAs in different roles. A shout out to all the Engrish that went into this show, it made some of the scenes hysterical (looking at the zombie episode in particular!), ah the Japanese cussing in Engrish, it truly never gets old.   \\n\\n\r\nNow lets wind this down and come to some of the problems I had with the show concerning the characters and plot. \"Plot\" he says? \"Character\" he says? \"In PSG\" he says? Yeah I'm off my rocker but hear me out for a second. PSG is structured like most Western cartoons in that it's split into mini-episodes into the 24-minute run. So in reality most episodes were about 11 minutes in length, 2 per airing. So each episode has a radically different director, storyboard, and content to it. What does create? You named it, a rather large fluctuation in quality and a lack of consistency. Don't get me wrong, this style is largely what made PSG so different in the first place and its probably PSG's greatest strength. This structure allows for each director to be experimental and that's arguably what makes up PSG's strongest episodes. Episodes like \"Vomiting Point\", \"Nothing to Room\" and \"Once Upon a Time in Garterbelt\" are examples of this, and what a haphazard style of directing can create. On the flip side, its also its biggest weakness as this style can create episodes with little to no direction and lack of coherence, episodes like \"The Runny\", \"If Angels wore Swimsuits\" and segments of \"Chuck to the Future\" are examples of the latter. Nonsensical events and shenanigans is what this show is about and is good at. It works up till a certain degree, until it becomes too much and stale.Which is why plot and direction become exceedingly important, it keeps things moving and changes everything up, maintaining a firm grip on the audience's attention. Consider episode 6 \"Les Diaboliques\". It was a perfect mesh of good sound design and appropriate tracks at the right times, awesome animation during the climax and subsequent fights, a balance between crazy and well-written humor (RUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRs anyone?), and just enough direction and plot intrigue (the introduction of the Demon Sisters). Best of all, I didn't feel that they sacrificed anything in favor of the madness that made up such a large part of previous episodes. Rather this madness was still there but actually had rhyme and reason to it now. Thinking back to it, IMO its the best episode of any anime this year. A great example of what could (and could not be) done with this show.\\n\\n\r\nFast-forward to the finale, and I was absolutely ecstatic at what was going to happen after what episode 12 had set-up. This would be episode 6 but a much larger scale right? Going back to the idea that PSG needed to strike a balance between its more absurd qualities and a more tried-and-true approach, it makes it all the more frustrating to see them find that balance as demonstrated in episode 6 only to get lost in their own cesspool of ideas during the finale. It wasn't bad by any stretch of the word but it was underwhelming compared to what episode 6 had accomplished before it. Without any coherence, everything was just a whole load of Gainax animators animating their insanity before I could properly register the hell I ended up watching. I can only remember awesome bits and pieces that happened in 13, if you asked me describe the whole episode in detail, I'd be hard-pressed to think of a proper synopsis. In effect, the whole thing was a blur to me, in contrast I can pretty much describe all the scenes in episode 6 quite well. That sums up my gripes with PSG, a lack of consistency (which could not have been avoided given its structure) and a lack of proper direction (could have been dealt with). Its nice to see all the Gainax animators working up a frenzy to create some mind-blowing material but sometimes it really ends up being their own scribbles. \\n\\n\r\nAnd a final mention of the last two minutes, those moments were just Gainax being so unabashedly Gainax that it was truly a sight to behold (we don't get much of that these days so cherish it!). I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't get a second season since this is Gainax we're talking about but I'd absolutely love to see more. Despite my personal feelings on the subject, this show was a breath of fresh air and reminded me how much fun anime could be. Yeah it could have been better, but than again, it was already incredibly entertaining and charming (never thought I'd use that word to describe this anime) to begin with.",

            "content": "I'm not going to mince words here, gentlemen. This right here is what is commonly referred to as an \"orgasm of excellence\". This series is so good it'll probably kill you by the time it's done. As in, this thing Gainax has made here can roughly fall under the definition of autoerotic asphyxiation. But that's just a summary of the show's quality as a whole, let's break this shit down:\r\nPREMISE:\r\nTo put it plainly, the entire point of this show is to take the illusions otaku have surrounded themselves with for the last 10 years and annihilate them through a wanton, infinite assault  of sexand Western style. This show is not Sora ga Otoshimaru Hime Desu Beats! or whatever the hell it is you people watch nowadays. This is about a gun-toting whore and her diabetic goth friend slashing and shooting giant monsters literally comprised of shit, armies of dead sperm soldiers and their especially polite and well-mannered rivals, and when they're not doing something like that they're getting into some other shenanigans which may or may not involve parodying Transformers. Oh yeah, they're Angels or something under the command of Black Dynamite and have Gir as their sidekick and have to collect coins by killing monsters to get back into Heaven. But honestly, who cares? There are panties in this show that turn into guns and it's funny as fuck. \\n\\n\r\nBehind all this exquisite and sophisticated comedy is probably one of the most feminist morals ever, another thing that separates P&S from your average animu. Through the entire series, the female main characters do what they want, when they want, how they want while the male lead is useless, flaky and gets captured a lot. This motif boils down to \"It's okay to be a bitch. Live free and if you screw up have a man clean up after you.\" As you can see, this show's driving message has all the modesty of its main duo.  It's fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, that token Gainax ending. It's there and as wonderful as ever.\\n\\n\r\nIt's entirely episodic like a US cartoon, but with an overarching point. There are actually 26 episodes, but they're all 12 minutes long. Each episode is two episodes. That's right, this show has a 2x Quality Multiplier.\\n\\n\r\nTHEM GRAPHICS:\\n\\n\r\nThis show oozes with style that has pretty much never been tried before in the Eastern world. Think Dead Leaves (if you haven't seen this, take 40 minutes away from that time vampire Korean MMO I'm sure you have minimized in the corner and watch it. Dubbed only. It'll be the best thing you'll see all month) meets Power Puff Girls. The art and animation quality are as incredible as they are unique, using a potent blend of patented hand-drawn Imaishi scribbles, CGI and actual, real-life explosions at the end of each battle. The comic-styled on-screen sound effects from Dead Leaves also make a return here in full force, and they make the whole thing such a cool and unique experience. Another, minor thing I like is that the girls change clothes every episode, a subtle but welcomed touch that more cartoons should employ.\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah, it should be noted that this isn't an \"ecchi comedy\" (Those aren't funny or even passable as entertainment. If you came here looking for one of those and are now reading this review with a twisted expression of shock on your face, it should be noted that I personally and sincerely hate you and several things that look like you). Yes, there are more sex jokes than I've ever seen in a 12 minute cartoon segment, but the girls themselves are not fappable. That's the point. If something along the lines of \"UNFAPPABLE ANIME GIRLS?! WHAT IS THIS\" just escaped the blubber of your face, this isn't the show for you. In fact, most shows and animation in general isn't for you. As said in the previous section, this show was designed to be the antithesis of every ecchi moe series that has ruined anime in the last decade.\\n\r\nThe punchline is that there are often scenes where Panty and Stocking become similar to standard, over-proportioned anime women to cocktease otaku, and there are people here who're actually going \"i don't get it, why wasnt the whole show like that?\". Jesus christ\\n\\n\r\nTHOSE CHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nThis won't be hard. We have /eight/ main characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nPANTY: She loves sex and violence. Her panties turn into a gun named Backlace. In episode 1, she banged four or five guys. I love Panty.\\n\r\nSTOCKING: She loves sweets and goth frills, not to mention looking down on her sister's bad habits. \"Serves you right! I hope you shit out all your organs! Hahaha!\" Also her stockings turn into katanas and she has a bondage fetish. I love Stocking.\\n\r\nGARTERBELT: A large, angry, black afropriest who tries his hardest to make the derelict angels do their jobs. Dude is awesome and intense. Also, a pedophile.\\n\r\nCHUCK: literally Gir\\n\r\nBRIEF: The nerd who follows Panty around, the anime everyfan that the show makes fun of. \\n\\n\r\nSCANTY & KNEESOCKS w/ FASTENER: Creating a beautiful parallel to our lustful and gluttonous heavenly duo(along with terabytes of more fan art), these two demonic siblings are just grand and add a much-needed team of villains for P&S to unknowingly beat each episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOH LORD THAT SOUNDTRACK:\\n\\n\r\nUpon beginning this show, I got five seconds in. I hit stop. I hit play. \\n\r\nYes, my brain said, the theme song is, in fact, electrorock \"PANTY STOCKING, PANTY PANTY STOCKING YEOW!!\" \\n\r\nAs expected from a Gainax original series, this soundtrack is godlike and like Gurren Lagann's, it's extremely varied. The ED alone makes the whole thing worth getting.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is out now btw. It's missing a few good tracks so gainax can release another one later for more $$$ or something though. Still, it's just swell.\\n\\n\r\nTO SUMMARIZE:\\n\\n\r\nGainax is trollan' weaboos hardcore while simultaneously resurrecting the entire medium with Imaishi's bare, tired hands. If you like style, great music and actual humor then you'll probably like this a lot. Oh yeah, and it's easily a contender for Anime of the Year, right next to Rainbow, DRRR and Sym-Bionic Titan.\\n\\n\r\nTruly a work of art, the only setback is that it isn't dubbed, and due to crunchyroll's indescribable faggotry, it won't be for a while.  I have a strong feeling, that with a patented Funi gag dub(WHICH IS COMING IN 2012 OH MY GOD), this show's quality will burst into dimensions the human mind can't even acknowledge.\\n\\n\r\n(editor's note 2013: the dub is great)",

        {
            "content": "\"So what's the point?\"\r\nThe main argument as to why Panty & Stocking is a masterpiece are all embellished ways of saying \"funny,\" \"it's a parody,\" and \"cool art.\" Some people go as far as to say that Panty & Stocking is actually genius scripting - a juxtaposition between today's current moe anime standard and hardcore \"American pop culture.\" I've even come across the explanation that Panty & Stocking is \"a new level of anime,\" one that doesn't require intricate or meaningful plot, characters, or story - essentially an anime that thrives on emotion and it's acute sense of humor.\r\nThat my friends, is complete bullshit.\r\nPanty &Stocking is an anime that relies on swears, penis jokes, and violence as its selling point. Now many anime have capitalized on at least one of these points before and have succeeded (Detroit Metal City, Seitokai Yakuindono, and Baccano! in respective order). So Panty & Stocking tried to do all three simultaneously. I found this not only moronic, but offensive. Never before have I actually been ashamed of watching anime. I am a male, and I have even strapped myself to a chair and watched such titles as Boku no Pico, Bible Black, the Ghost Stories dub, and a high amount of other borderline disturbing anime and media with radical content and ideas and not ever have I felt what I felt when watching Panty & Stocking. \\n\r\nI felt stupid.\\n\r\nWhat do I mean by that? I mean that Panty & Stocking insulted my intelligence and grouped me in the level of humor that one would find in such riveting pieces of American glory like \"Family Guy\" and \"Superjail.\" I personally watch anime because I view it as a medium that has great qualities that other media culture could learn from. I openly started Panty & Stocking with hopes that it would verily mock the troupes one could find in American media in a way that had not been done before. What I received was a trashbin of repetitive storylines combined with zero-dimensional characters that did nothing but yell about phallus's and excrement. The attempt on grasping American culture (even today's pop culture, which is what I believe Panty & Stocking wanted to poke fun at) disgusted me. Not once did I find the use of references to famous American films appropriate. Not only did the references have nothing to do with the episodes at hand, I felt that Panty & Stocking tried to take such references and use them as a tool of manipulation trying to coax viewers into thinking that Panty & Stocking was legitimately a smart piece of composition. I can easily see where people would be misled, that is with the art looking similar to various cartoons in America, Panty & Stocking must be a parody! Not at all. In fact, Powerpuff Girls had a stronger plot to begin with, and to even group this anime together with that cartoon would be slander to Craig McCracken. The animation may be new to Japan, but it has been seen before in cartoons, and it's been seen better so all exclamations like \"The art is weird so it's good!\" and \"Different art just isn't appreciated!\" are false. Gainax, one of the most acclaimed and profitable animation studios in Japan, truly abused the art style to boot. Watching only a few episodes you can see where corners were cut (which is extremely noticeable in episodes 10, 11, and 12.) A recap in a thirteen episode anime, should never be necessary. How is it that anime such as Legend of the Galactic Heroes, Monster, and Glass Mask, spanning over fifty episodes each never used a single recap episode in its main series, yet Gainax has the balls to put one in a thirteen episode /comedy/ series? Truly outrageous.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Panty & Stocking might as well have been pieces of shit or drivels of snot. Oh I must have forgotten. They are pieces of shit and drivels of snot. Nearly every antagonist, save the demon sisters whom I will touch upon in a moment, makes the characters from Mars of Destruction look creative. They exist solely to be discarded, and even worse, to swallow precious moments of your time away. The demon sisters who are introduced halfway through the series actually shined a beam of light down onto this hellhole of a production, but only briefly. They were first brought into play standing for everything that Panty and Stocking opposed and after their episode had ended, I hoped for more episodes similar to theirs to occur. But what do I get? A conflict that builds between the antagonists and protagonists for one episode, and then the demon sisters regress into Team Rocket. Never again are the demon sisters relevant as antagonists and most of the proceeding episodes are focused on them releasing some sort of monster and then failing as they fly into the sky. Now the supporting characters might as well be called the crippling characters, because that is really all they do to the overall story. Garterbelt does nothing but hinder the story and abuse the stereotypical \"all priests are gay child molesters.\" If this was meant to be a way to confront the issue in the Vatican, it failed, and if it was meant to be a funny comment on the church's political standpoint, then well, it failed again. Garterbelt assumes the role of mentor to Panty & Stocking but ultimately ends up being a total eyesore and teaches the protagonists nil. And then there's Chuck who is likened by many to Gir from the Invader Zim series. The main difference between the two is that Gir was actually funny. I really don't think I have to go into much detail on Chuck's character design because all he says is Chuck and is then squashed by a larger object. He plays absolutely no role at any point in the series, but there exists an episode in which he is the focus. After watching this episode I was very much tempted to sign up for lessons in Japanese so I could write angry letters to the writer in his native language begging him to quit his career in animation and move onto a medium that won't suffer from his obvious mental deficiency. Then is the character named Brief, who portrays the cliched disgusting otaku with no merits other than his apparently large penis. His atrocious character design is only overshadowed by Panty's single trait - how much of a gigantic unlovable disease infested whore she is. Both her and Stocking are obvious fodder for prepubescent virgin teenagers attracted to the sheer idea of sex. I would even go as far as saying that if this anime did not contain explicit transformation scenes in which characters remove their undergarments it would be nowhere near as acclaimed as it is. That is to say, the fanbase consists of perverts striving to find some deeper meaning in their anime which they try to defend by explaining that if you don't like it, then you must have a poor sense of humor or need to \"loosen up.\" Compare Panty & Stocking to Mitsudomoe - both anime including large amounts of sexual content used as jokes - Mitsudomoe has characters that possess qualities beyond \"she likes sweets\" and \"a huge bitch\" though. Panty & Stocking can't actually even compete with Mitsudomoe on a scale larger than sex jokes, because the characters and story are so disabled that it merely strives to fill the void with even more moments of mediocrity. I don't find Panty & Stocking unfunny because it doesn't suit my humor, I find it unfunny because there is no humor to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the canon discontinuation. Anyone who tries to makes sense of the abominable ending or any one of the episodes all together deserves to have themselves locked into a sanitarium. Another reviewer describes the two eleven minute episodes per episode as a \"times two multiplier\" but I would I disagree and say that it's actually a divided by two denominator. The split episodes merely reflect the inconsistency and the lack of coherency that Panty & Stocking exclusively has. One moment the entire cast is zombified, the next everyone is on the beach being sexually violated by sea monsters. Not ever will the story amount to anything beyond not having one.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in Panty & Stocking, I will cede, is very good. The ending song, performed by Lisa, is wonderful and regrettably has very little to do with the anime. In the ending sequence a scene that appears to be a vague backstory on both Panty & Stocking exists, and alas once more, Gainax turned their noses away from such a sweet smelling idea. Even cartoons for the youngest of children have stories explaining the origination of their characters. Dora the Explorer had more character development than Panty & Stocking. Beyond the ending are numerous in episode tracks, whilist very enjoyable, I felt that many of them were overplayed and often unfitting (I can recall about four episodes ending with the song that includes the lyrics \"Clap your hands.\") The opening is closest thing to piece of satirical work - the song is a shout-out to all cartoons which only repeat the characters name over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you've actually read this far, I believe you've come to the conclusion that I hate Panty & Stocking. If you thought anything but that, then you're wrong, because I detest Panty & Stocking more than a Red Sox fan from Boston hates the Yankees. It is an insult to the medium of anime almost as much as is when someone says \"You like anime? Then you must love anime porn,\" and I will end this review saying Panty & Stocking does nothing but encourage statements like that. It gives a foul name to anime, for it lacks the fineness that geniuses like Tezuka and Kon worked themselves to death to bring us. When it comes to Panty & Stocking, I am disturbed with anime being associated with it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for people who may find this review too serious and that I must not have \"understood the point\" of this show I would like to say that I did not miss the point. You just made up a point yourself, because this anime lacks one.",

            "content": "If you're going to watch this show, you should know a few things right off the bat:\r\nIt is a not a sophisticated series.\r\nAs an anime in general,  its selling point is not a deep and compelling story with fleshed out characters, exploring various philosophical issues in order to deliver a good message. \r\nAs a comedy anime, its humor is not very classy. Its laughs are not derived from insider knowledge (well, most of them) or sublime writing.\r\nSo what exactly is the appeal of this anime, you ask?\r\nIn Gainax's own words, \"vulgar and indecent jokes\".\r\nThis is usually not a good selling point for anything, becausehonestly potty humor is very rarely an effective form of comedy. It is quite possible you will not find this series appealing even if you legitimately give it a try. That's fine.\\n\\n\r\nHowever if you're anything like me, you'll find the result is surprisingly entertaining and one of Gainax's best (if strangest) shows. \\n\\n\r\nThe refuge in vulgarity works fantastically, and the numerous references to western animation/movies, slick animation, awesome music, zany characters, and blatant abuse of engrish makes for a very fun experience; if you've ever played Conker's Bad Fur Day, it's very similar. it's honestly one of the most entertaining anime I have seen in a long time. In typical Gainax fashion, the ending will involve you tearing your hair out.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a very love or hate series; either you will find it fun as hell or you'll hate it and find it a disgusting waste of animation cells. I'd at least give it a try, but you should know what to expect before you watch it.",

            "content": "Out of all shows that have been presented in Fall 2010, it seems there is no show like Panty and Stocking which has so decisively split viewer opinions into clear cut groups that either believe it's the best thing that's ever happened since sliced bread, or have banished it to the depths of utter disdain. The question I ask right now and will answer in this review is if one or even both sides are justified.\r\nFirst thing that one should wonder is what this show was trying to accomplish.  I'm not a fan of Gainax, and thus I am not extremely acquainted with theirworks. However it's pretty apparent that Gainax was trying to do something that would be different.  What they have isn't a complicated or redeeming story.  Far from it. The two main characters Panty and Stocking are impulsive and obsessed with sex and sweets respectively.  That's all there is to the main characters, and that never changes throughout the show. The most development you ever see from the story or characters is in the priest Garterbelt, who is given a moderately interesting backstory in one episode complete with some decent use of dramatic and comedic elements. Outside of that, the show cannot be praised for its plot and characters alone. For the most part, the show progresses episodically more or less simply because there is a lack of a cohesive plot.\\n\\n\r\nGiven that the show is really not aiming to please its audience with traditional story elements, the main option remaining is clearly humor. Probably one of the biggest factors in creating split opinions among viewers (aside from the deliberately shallow plot) is the decision of the show to choose crude and vulgar humor as its primary form of entertainment.  Now please do not take this the wrong way.  Crude and vulgar humor alone doesn't ruin a show, but at the same time, there is in fact a right way to do it so that it actually is entertaining. The way I see it, P&S both fails and succeeds simultaneously in this department.\\n\\n\r\nThe way P&S fails at humor comes down to how at least half the time, the jokes have nothing to do with anything in the plot.  The perfect example of this is Panty's Engrish profanity.  You should be ashamed of yourself if you find it funny, because it really doesn't serve any purpose and has no relevance to anything that actually happens. A lot of extremely brief references to pop culture all around the world are made throughout the series, and they might as well not exist since again, virtually none of them have any relevance to anything that happens as Panty and Stocking are destroying things, indulging in worldly desires, playing volleyball, showing off as idols, etc.\\n\\n\r\nOn the good half of humor however, some of the show's mini plots do in fact turn out to be truly entertaining and original. Part of the originality comes through the amazing production alone. By itself, the concept of sperm soldiers on a mission to enter the womb might only raise brows at best (given that particular concept has definitely been done at least once by Family Guy as I recall, and only god knows what South Park hasn't covered), but it's the imagination of the developers that truly brings such a concept and a few others to life with vibrant colors, eye catching motions/effects, and sweated detail where it counts. P&S's art style is a bit unusual, comparable more to that of western animation as opposed to what is commonly used in anime. The almost bouncy object designs however work perfectly for this series, which tries its best to be unafraid of venturing into dangerous territory that no other group (besides Gainax presumably) would dare lay eyes upon. It's fair to say that the times that P&S does come up with something original, it is genuinely well presented.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the latter half of the series, while P&S never truly abandons trying to come up with more and more of these good and bad mini-plots, an attempt to create an actual plot direction occurs, but this is extremely brief and intermittent. This isn't to say that there was any extra legitimate plot or character development. However post-introduction of the demon sisters, the quality of action scenes goes from decent to astounding during several interactions between the conflicting angels and demons. Again, the plot and characters really can't be praised for much, but it's at least apparent that Gainax is trying, and it shows in how detailed and well scripted some of the fights become.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I feel the biggest problem with P&S is consistency.  What I believe Gainax was trying to accomplish was anything but a simple task. Being \"different\" especially in a day and age where there are uncountable records for every original concept that has ever existed is a tall order. Was Gainax trying to be funny? Were they in the end actually trying to make a new kind of story? Or were they just trolling everyone? It doesn't seem far off that they were probably going for a combination of all three, and that resulted in sacrifices in certain areas, or times where they simply just ran out of really good ideas.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, P&S does have its moments, both good and bad, and generally it will be easy for most people to focus on either the good things or the bad things, but not both. To its credit though, it is different. Ultimately I would personally look towards American sitcoms, probably South Park in particular if you're looking for something actually funny. Otherwise it is up to you to decide where your tastes lie when considering this show.",

            "content": "\"Fuck if I have a clue.\" -Panty\r\nI'm not one to normally start off a review with a quote, but from my perspective nothing summed up this show quite so perfectly. Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is the anime parody of western cartoons. To put it accurately, you take the Powerpuff Girls and cross them with South Park. The result, an amalgamation of crude humor, sex jokes, false ecchi, monsters of the week, Team Rocket, and two \"Angels\" who may just be the antithesis of angels. Allow me to say that it was fucking incredible. \r\nStory: ???\r\nYeah, I'm not really certain of how I should labelthis aspect of the show. I mean, c'mon, you read the description, what the fuck is this? How can I possibly score that? It's a bit easier to talk about it rather than apply a numerical value. The story on it's own is fairly solid, our two bitches with halos have to fight big monsters throughout the city to try and get back to heaven. The specifics have a flare of creativity about them, but the basic concept is nothing even remotely new (not that it's trying to be). I won't deny that after two or three episodes this unoriginal concept started to feel pretty damn stale. The monsters and their respective renditions of chaos certainly did not provide a reason to watch this show. This does change for a little while when the monster of the week scenario is coupled with Team Rocket's nefarious plans to enact evil upon the city, through the use of weekly monsters. I say Team Rocket but really they're just a group with the exact same dynamic as team rocket (this is a parody show). The entry of this evil trio also eventually felt stale because the question of \"what's their plan and how is it going to fail\" can only hold one's interest for so long. But ultimately, the monsters and nefarious stratagems are not why we're supposed to watch this show. \\n\r\nOh, and fuck Gainax endings. That one after-credits scene didn't happen until they decide to announce another season. I'm fairly certain that the studio was just delivering us with a pointed jab in reference to their reputation, but honestly, fuck that.... >.>\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art style is just like what we 90's kids (and older) used to watch on Saturday mornings. It sustains a cartoonish feel from the character designs to the panoramic shots of the city. The action is balls-to-the-walls and over the top with big explosions and bold faced text. What's so bloody amusing about having this art-style is the fact that this show is still an ecchi, but the art-style prevents sexual arousal in any format whatsoever. Sorry guys, you'll have to look elsewhere to get your fix. Parodying the ecchi aspect of anime by using western styles is honestly rather brilliant, but with that said, I wasn't a fan of it. Throughout the show we occasionally see an abrupt change in animation style. The only recurring instance of this is when our two Angels undergo a \"magical girl outfit change\" of sorts. The animation adopts the modern anime style and showcases the girl's removing their signature garment in a lewd fashion, all the while being next to a stripping pole. This serves as a tease of sorts to the audience with the creators taunting us by saying: \"Heh heh heh, look what you DON'T get to see.\" The reason why I disliked the cartoonish feel prevalent throughout most of the series is because I don't think it added anything. I do not believe incorporating that style was a bad-idea, this is meant to be a parody show through and through, but I would have preferred a balance between how the show was drawn. The initial fun of seeing that manner of art with the anime influence lost its charm after the first few episodes. Throw an episode of cartoon here and original there, maybe incorporate one episode meant to be like Gurren Lagann or any other anime with a distinctive method of animation.  They could have parodied other anime along with the western cartoons. Beyond the modern anime design we occasionally got art reminiscent of Transformers, South Park, and even a 1/2 episode that almost looked akin to rotoscoping (I'm not entirely sure if that was the method they used, an eye for art is not my forte).\\n\r\nThe actual quality of the art is a bit difficult for me to judge, but I am going to say it was very solid on the whole. It was simple, but I never picked up on any instances where the animation seemed choppy or distorted, the overall quality seemed consistent throughout the entirety of the 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is surprisingly awesome. I never would have imagined that this little parody could produce a genuinely good musical score. Featuring a heavy amount of electronica that blends perfectly with the feel of the show.  A few of these tracks quickly found their way into my musical library. \\n\r\nThe true standout aspect of the sound however is most definitely the English dub. At this point the dub has become rather famous, sticking true to the parody aspect, a HEAVY abundance of crude humor and profanity is draped over the dialogue. I'm not one to instantly say that swearing=humor, but in this scenario it is a concept that works beautifully. Adding in a few \"fucks\" every sentence isn't a good recipe on it's own, thankfully Funimation pulled out their A-game to present us with an excellent cast to accompany the profanity ridden dialogue. With Jaimie Marchi and Monica Rial at the helm, Cristopher Sabat as first mate, and Joel Mcdonald as the cabin boy, the respective performances of Panty, Stocking, Garterbelt, and Brief were positively stellar. The supporting cast also did fantastic as well, Cherami Leigh and Colleen Clinkenbeard as the demon sisters were particularly memorable as their haughty arrogance and composure in the face of ridiculousness provided a hilarious dichotomy. Though I do give special applause towards Monica Rial for playing Stocking. Not necessarily because her voice-work was more impressive, but rather due to the fact that Stocking is juxtaposed to nearly every other role Rial is cast in. On most occasions Rial is employed by playing the sweet and kind characters with the high pitched voice and lovable demeanor. Sure, Stocking has the high pitched voice, but when her first line is \"Fuck off! Don't talk to me till I've had my sugar!\" Damn it all, we're in for a treat. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nHaha, oh damn, these characters. To start this off let's talk about the two Angel sisters, or the two hoe-bags, hookers, cum-dumpsters, etc, etc. Just think of a derogatory name generally applied to females and these two are likely called it at some point or another. Panty and Stocking Anarchy, the two seem to be the personification of Lust and Gluttony (respectively), which is a bit ironic considering they're you know, ANGELS. Panty is the blonde, sex obsessed slut. She loves taking the spotlight and is generally more rude than her sister, employing a higher amount expletives and bearing a persona with a vast increase in crudeness. Stocking is the goth angel with an unparalleled love for sweets. She's a bit more calm than her older sister, though she is definitely capable of outbursts due to rage. She is masochistic and though no where near as addicted to sex as Panty (she prefers to be a bit of a tease), she is far from innocent. You can draw quite a few parallels between their personalities and their names. Panty who is far more outright, with removing one's panties being effect simile of an invitation for sex. And Stocking, the more tame sister with a tendency to tease, and removing one's leggings is more of a teasing aspect. A not so subtle interplay between character names, designs, and their personalities. \\n\r\nYou also have Garterbelt, the splendiferous, afro-wearing preacher that serves as the caretaker of Panty and Stocking. He's constantly annoyed and exasperated with the Sister's antics, and insulting them is their primary form of interaction. For being a preacher he's quite amoral, but when you have angels like Panty and Stocking, who the fuck knows what religion we're dealing with. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis is honestly one of the best comedy anime I have ever seen in my life. I felt like I was watching a brilliantly scripted and acted abridged series as opposed to a legitimate production. The dialogue is so foul and outrageou the entire show was a goldmine for one-liners. I'm certain that I'll have to go back and rewatch the show a few times just to ensure I didn't miss anything while laughing. The pop-culture references littered throughout the dialogue added an extra dose of hilarity as it ensured the jokes never got too stale . References like referring to the View as \"Four bitter lesbians\".  \\n\r\nIf I had to name one aspect that I didn't enjoy it would have to be the pervasive amount of toilet humor. I reach a threshold where jokes about shit, vomit, piss, and picking one's nose aren't funny (said threshold generally being one joke). I understand that the creators were taking a no-holds-barred approach, but it got stale very, very quickly. Luckily, even when these odious elements took center stage, the dialogue not pertaining to the vileness that permeated the scene salvaged the episode on the whole. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThis oddball of a show is certainly deserving of a nine. You have to rate it on a certain scale, but for what it was trying to accomplish it was approaching perfection. Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is a peculiar comedy that should honestly be watched by anyone who has ever laughed at a joke from South Park.",

Its so bad I felt its needed that I tell everyone that its an abomination and I cant even be nice about it. Now here comes why...\r\nStory - None, this is an episodic series with no progression in site. It follows the same plot every time, something goes wrong and it a ghost's fault so the protagonists must stop it. there's nothing beyond this format to be seen.\r\nArt - Its a poor attempt of taking Cartoon Network cartoon styles like PowerPuff Girls and throwing a bitof Japanese style in there. Its nothing new, even the pet dog, Chuck, is a rip off of GIR from Invader Zim. Green dog, black ears and a zipper, drawn somewhat differently but obviously refers to that.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The music in general is almost the best part about the series, its not totally bad at some points while others once again try to twist the nipple of western culture leaving it weeping and violated.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The characters are as one dimensional as you can get. \\n\r\nPanty - A sex crazed bitch\\n\r\nStocking - Sweets loving bitch\\n\r\nGarterbelt - their boss and a gay priest\\n\r\nChuck - a spastic non-important dog\\n\\n\r\nNone of these characters show any traits beyond this, they dont ever develop and it doesnt seem like it ever will.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - The attempt at humour was abhorrent. It attempted to use western humour and failed...miserably. It threw in at a non-stop rampage of vulgarities, sexual and bathroom humour to the point it has no meaning or general punchline. It angered me, Ive watched plenty of anime and cartoons in various genres and this series really falls out as so far the worst.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Its depressing that GAINAX had its hands in this. As a fan of their works its sad to see them spiral downwards with more and more sub-par works. This has hit rock bottom. This anime is so bad I cannot even produce a counter argument so I can show that I can be reasonable about this.\\n\\n\r\nUnless you are forced to watch it, don't.",

            "content": "Critic\u2019s Log - Earthdate: November 24, 2013. Review #69: Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt\r\nWarning: This review contains subject matter that is not appropriate for young children.\r\nNovember 23, 2013 was a very special day, Yesterday was The Day of The Doctor. It was the 50th Anniversary of the longest Science-Fiction series Doctor Who. Pffft, fuck that! *ahem* Actually, I really enjoy Doctor Who and I was just joking, But this day should also be honoring all doctors of all fields, you know\u2026 the doctors that give you your checkups to see that you are healthy. Also, let\u2019s not forget the teachers that teach high school studentsSex Education. Hold on, Teachers are not doctors. Even with what I was told in High School, I did a lot of researching. Why? Because any young adult would have. Hell, it was bound to happen after someone goes through puberty. Who am I kidding? Why the hell am I bringing this all up!? Well, this review I am about to start is an anime that\u2019s going to blow your mind without squeezing your eyeballs like popping cherries. Get ready to get turned on and aroused with Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt!\\n\\n\r\nIn a town named Daten City there is a group of ghosts that move in that are taking advantage of human greed. In Daten City there also lives Two angels (as well as sisters), Panty and Stocking, are sent from heaven to exterminate them. However ,in  reality they got kicked out for naughty behavior.\\n\\n\r\nOh dear, where do I begin? Well, this is a Studio Gainax production and this is by far their most interesting show to talk about, as random as it gets. I remembered watching how silly, manly, awesome, and badass Gurren Lagann was and I remembered how cool FLCL was. With Panty and Stocking, this is a little different. Before you say that the animation is decent, well this show will trick you right there. The animation may not look like much, but that is exactly what Gainax intended. Gainax payed homage to American animation and even some other stuff. The style is unorthodox compared to the typical anime viewing we tend to get. Panty and Stocking succeeds strongly here. The animation is inconsistent intentionally and I swear this is one of the most over the top anime that Gainax has produced. Dead Leaves is crazy, Gurren Lagann is awesome, FLCL is fun. Panty and Stocking is pretty much all of that rolled into one. Also, the explosions are fucking hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nBut the biggest highlight of the animation is the transformation sequence. Enough said. Am I the only one that thinks that Gainax really got a little too carried away with these scenes. I mean they made Panty and Stocking look pretty. fucking. hot. With a show like Panty and Stocking, Gainax sure had a lot of fun making this show and they made this show awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Taku Takahashi and TCY Crew is also pretty damn good. Like the show\u2019s nature, the soundtrack is crazy, loud, and just way too fun. Well\u2026 for the most part. The soundtrack compliments the show and it is a soundtrack worth listening to outside the show. The opening is a rare anomaly when it comes to anime. It\u2019s only 30 seconds long. As for the closing,  it\u2019s pretty nice. The highlight song is undeniably \u201cFly Away\u201d by TeddyLoid. This song kicks ass and it makes the transformation scenes or any other scene that the song is used in worth watching. This soundtrack is great and another strong factor to this show.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to voice acting, The Japanese cast is over-the-top like you would expect. Arisa Ogasawara is a blast as Panty, Mariya Ise is also great as Stocking. Kouji Ishii is hilarious as Garterbelt. Hiroyuki Yoshino plays Brief well. Yuka Komatsu and Ayumi Fujimura are great as Scanty and Kneesocks, and Shigeru Chiba is over-the-top as Corset. The Japanese cast is well-casted because of the show\u2019s nature. As with the English Dub, Jamie Marchi is a riot as Panty. Monica Rial was a huge surprise for me. If you thought she gives her characters whiny voices, Think again! That is actually her normal voice on a everyday basis, well...for the most part. Beside that, She is fucking hilarious as Stocking. As far as English Dubs go, Stocking is one of my favorite roles that Monica Rial has voiced. Chris Sabat does the voice of Garterbelt which I swear is either awkward or just too damn funny. A white guy voicing a character that is Black. I\u2019ll let you be the judge on this one. The only thing that Chris Sabat is lacking is the over-the-top quality that Ishii-san pulled off well. Even though Garterbelt is played by an Asian man and a white man. The voices are still pretty good, but I must admit\u2026 I think Kouji Ishii had the better performance. There were a couple of moments that Chris Sabat botched. The fact that he\u2019s a white guy, he does give a convincing performance in the dub. Joel McDonald is terrific as Brief. Colleen Clinkenbeard and Cherami Leigh are pretty good as Scanty and Kneesocks. Chris Ayres is okay as Corset. Know you\u2019re probably wondering why I\u2019m not mentioning Takashi Nakamura and Ian Sinclair when it comes to Chuck. That\u2019s because they don\u2019t need to do a whole lot of work with that character. Just saying. They were both good. As much as I like the Dub, I will say that the Subtitled Version has one advantage over the Dub, and that is even though the language in Japanese, most of the profanity is spoken in English\u2026Allow me to correct myself, it is spoken in ENGRISH. But even if the Subtitled Version has one advantage over the dub. I will compliment Colleen Clinkenbeard for her credit in the ADR direction and taking the liberties to stay true to the original Japanese script despite some differences in dialogue even though it\u2019s insensitive either way. It is still a Dub worth listening to, but I strongly recommend watching the Subtitled Version before or after watching the dub if you want a good laugh.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of good laughs, The characters are a riot. Panty is not the stereotypical dumb blonde. She\u2019s just very selfish, She\u2019s very rebellious, rude, easily angered, and very bitchy. She is also a sexaholic. All she cares about is finding men to fuck and she likes to help her friend \u201cPinkie Pie\u201d.Yeah, I just went there. Stocking is a complete opposite to Panty even though she has her own \u201cinterests\u201d. She likes to eat sweets (hmm, interesting), she can be just as rude when pissed off, and she compliments Panty very well when it comes to appearance, personality, etc\u2026 Garterbelt is also a great character to watch alongside Panty and Stocking. His \u201cinterests\u201d sure are interesting but not for everybody. The entire trio is a riot. Scanty and Kneesocks are pretty much Panty and Stocking\u2019s counterparts as well as archenemies. The same goes for Garterbelt\u2019s archenemy. But they compliment eachother fittingly. But here\u2019s a kicker, the main characters aren\u2019t the only fun characters, so are the episode exclusive ones as well and a couple interesting ones as well. Oh let\u2019s not forget Chuck. He is awesome, Why? Because if you remember Invader Zim and loved GIR, then you\u2019ll love Chuck.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe show has appreciative animation, the show has kickass music, the show has funny characters, and should the story be important? Pfft, fuck no! The show contains shit jokes, penis jokes, boob jokes, women jokes, men jokes, sperm jokes, weight jokes, nose-picking, vomiting, Ass-kicking action, robots, Zombies, sex toy jokes, lawyers, the Beach, relationships, Chuck, backstories, a music video, transformation scenes, Movie homages, video game homages, TV show homages, Movie title parodies, TV show title parodies, sex jokes and a bunch of other shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits that this show has offer.This show is socially insensitive, insensitive on gender, and it is religiously offensive to a certain degree, and guess what? This show does not give two fucks about all that. This show is very sporadic, yet it was done on purpose. And\u2026That\u2019s why Panty and Stocking is an awesome anime. Here\u2019s the one important kicker. This is not a Hentai anime even though it has a lot of sexual jokes and moments. There\u2019s even a few sex scenes albeit not as explicit as a Hentai anime. Let\u2019s remain mature, shall we? He he\u2026 Giggity. Anyway the show is pretty awesome in the long run. That is until\u2026\\n\\n\r\nPanty and Stocking with Garterbelt is available by Funimation.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is a crude series that was intentional since Day One. It is an awesome anime once you turn your brain off, On second thought\u2026 Let this anime fuck your brians out. The animation is appreciative, the soundtrack is bitching, the characters are out of this world, and fuck the plot. The show is not perfect, but it is still awesome.\\n\\n\r\nI give Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt a 9.2 out of 10, it is EXCELLENT!\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment, and REPENT MOTHERFUCKERS!",

We all knew that it will be a good anime which will include \"PowerPuff Girls\" and \"Dead Leaves\" in it, that it will be a bit of fanservice, but... BUT GAINAX, I LOVE YOU, you just made my morning with it - it was higher-higher-higher of all my expectations. PanSto just made of win.\r\nIf you don't like shit, sex and sluts - just don't watch that. I don't wanna see anymore of you whoread annotations and watched it anyway.\\n\r\nIt has good stand-alone art, SUDDEN opening and SUDDEN ending; this ED just adds some humor, if you think about WHY so good song is the ending of THIS anime and not the ending of some slice of life or shoujo. \\n\r\nJust sit back, enjoy and laugh as you can.",

            "content": "What's more important? Dazzling animation or a gripping story?\r\nWell Gainax definitely chose animation over everything with PSG.\r\nSTORY: It's about two fallen angels, Panty and Stocking, who got kicked out of heaven and are now trying to work their way back by defeating ghosts by using their namesake items (a pair of panties that transforms into a gun,and stocking socks that transform into swords) to combat them and to try to earn coins so they can return back, all in a episodic rate.\r\nWell that's pretty much the gist of the plot.\r\nThis is also, by the way, a comedy... a very rauchy, gross, and repeatative one infact. \\n\r\nPanty's intire joke throughout each episode is \"Oh boy am I a slut,\" that's even her character. While Stocking is a goth loli girl (Well dresses like one) who loves sweets, who doesn't seem to have anything else that would be considered interesting about her character. \\n\r\nAll Panty really does is remind you is she a total slut, and has sex in every episode. Well that is, unfortunately, the anime's signature run on joke.\\n\\n\r\nWith lots of cursing, sex jokes, and very gross situations (Panty gets literally covered in shit in the first episode, and is also a slut, in case you haven't heard me the first time, because the anime won't let you forget and neither will I) some would say this is like South Park. However South Park is actually funny and can be very smart satire (When it's not being gross or even when it's gross), award winning satire in fact, while PSG is just run on gags and gross toilet humor, it's more like a rauchier, gross, adult version of the powerpuff girls.\\n\\n\r\nThere's really nothing redeeming or creative about this anime EXCEPT-\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: -This is some of the most awe inspiring animation that even people who complain about Japan does nothing different with animation will be left with their jaws dropping to the ground, but the whole transformation pole dancing scenes (Yeah you read that right, oh yeah, Panty's also a slut) are just there to be models for obvious figurines to market off of, but does feature incredible animation for said scenes. \\n\r\nAnd when Panty and Stocking defeat a ghost, it does a live action sequence where a model of the ghost gets blown up, which only adds to uniqueness of the animation direction. \\n\r\nVery gutsy and highly experimental animation, though many will be turned off by it, more will be turned off by it's so called plot.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Very catchy background music and a great ending theme song. \\n\r\nThe opening theme though, I found it annoying to say the least. \\n\r\nThough it was amusing to hear the characters swear in english, the dialogue is highly offensive and can be just as gross as it's subject matter.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ Great Animation, something totally bizarre yet inspiring.\\n\r\n+ Catchy Music, specifically the ending theme song.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- Repetitive comedy that only rely on low brow humor.\\n\r\n- Very gross, The first episode alone is disgusting.\\n\r\n- Story?\\n\r\n- Highly Offensive to all audiences.\\n\\n\r\nPSG, is the amazing animation and catchy music worth it to keep people watching? For me, no way in hell (Though I can see myself visiting it again, oh yeah and reminder: Panty's a slut), but this is something that will definitely get a cult following for sure.\\n\r\nThe story and comedy are uninspiring and annoyingly repetitive, and is quite disappointing from the same studio who produced FLCL, Gurren Lagann, and Neon Genesis Evangelion, but this is (surprisingly) something I would reccomend anyone to check out for the animation alone and ultimately let you decide if it's worth your time or not.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nThere are certain opinions that are accepted on MAL, and certain opinions that stir up lots of anger. Certain anime series can't be praised and others can't be criticized without creating an absolute hailstorm of \"unhelpfuls\". I don't mean to come across as a mean spirited contrarian and kick any sacred cows, but I have to be honest. This is one of my least favorite anime comedy series. I don't think I laughed once the entire time. That's an accomplishment! I'm pretty easy to make laugh. YES, I understand that the director intended the series to parody the crass stupidity of American comedy and showwhat American comedy feels like to a Japanese audience. The problem is that this is NOT a good parody/spoof of American stupidity. It is just a very lazy and totally ineffectual copy of it. Mike Judge's Idiocracy with the short \"film\" OW My Balls! was a parody. Panty and Stocking is just like watching a bottom 50% episode of Family Guy or a bottom 10% episode of South Park where Trey and Matt are really off their game that week. I don't actually hate Hiroyuki Imaishi and I KNOW that he can do better, but this series simply wasn't one of his best efforts.\\n\\n\r\nPlot and character: 2/10: \\n\\n\r\nThere is no real engaging plot obviously. The basic premise is that 2 naughty girl angels get kicked out of Heaven and must use lingerie items as weapons in order to fight ghosts and eventually buy their way back into heaven with the requisite number of award points. To be frank, the plot to Ren and Stimpy was better than this! Panty and Stocking is highly episodic in nature and each episode is as painfully unfunny as the last. The characters are insanely obnoxious, unfunny, and have none of the appeal of the characters in South Park, Family Guy, or any of the shows that this allegedly is spoofing. This is NOT coming from someone who thinks Family Guy is a well written show BTW. I HATE Family Guy! I just happen to hate Panty and Stocking a LOT more. Why? Because Family Guy can on very rare occasion still make me laugh, unlike this giant shit monster! Did anyone else think the Giant Shit Monster in episode 1 was an allusion to the show itself? The thought certainly crossed MY mind.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is actually pretty decent. It is a long way from the best Gainax is capable of, but it is clearly the highlight of the series for what its worth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are few things in life worse than sitting through a comedy that's extremely unfunny. This is like watching a version of \"Meet the Spartans\" that lasts for 6 hours!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nSo what could this series have done differently? Could it have been saved and remade to actually be funny? The answer to this previous question is YES! Panty and Stocking has plenty of potential, but it was highly flawed in its execution. Firstly, the 2 main characters are simply WAY too annoying. It is acceptable to have a comedy with a fairly annoying protagonist, but there is a certain line in the sand where once you cross it, the comedy becomes un-watchable. This is why nobody liked The Love Guru, Freddy Got Fingered, or Biodome. If the characters just grate on your every nerve, 100% of the time they are on screen, it stops being funny and starts becoming an absolute chore to watch. Secondly, Panty and Stocking really needed to better develop its own sense of humor, more like Imaishi's other works Gurren Lagann and Inferno Cop. There is a difference between \"homage\", \"spoof\", and lazy ripoff. This felt like a lazy ripoff. Lastly, Imaishi's high energy absurdist humor can quickly begin to wear on the viewer's nerves. Much like Seth McFarland's style of comedy, it can be decent in small doses and VERY annoying in large doses. Panty and Stocking would have massively benefited from having much shorter episodes in the style of Imaishi's later work Inferno Cop.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: If you want a goofy Hiroyuki Imaishi anime, please skip this one and go watch Inferno Cop instead. You will be very glad you did!",

            "content": "WARNING: This review contains mature language and content that may not be acceptable for all readers. \r\nPanty and Stocking is a unique anime in the sense that in not only has some of the fastest jokes I've ever seen in an anime, but this is the dirtiest, sluttiest, grossist, most foul mouthed anime I've ever seen, including hentai!!!\r\nStory: The story is your basic monster-of-the-week story with Panty and Stocking fighting a different ghost in each episode and each ghost having his own unique powers. However, I will point out that because this is such a short anime, the episodical nature of the story doesn't wearyou down as much as it would for animes with 100 episodes or more.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I don't want to spoil anything, but by the final episodes the story gets much more climatic and you have to keep watching to the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I can describe Panty and Stocking in one word, \"bitches\". If you search the words \"Angel + Bitch\", Panty and Stocking will be the first things to pop-up. However, I love Panty and Stocking because they're bitches! I love watching them argue, I love watching them neglecting their responsibilities, I love watching Stocking eat sugar and Panty hump every man that walks down the street. I can't explain it, but if Panty and Stocking actually behaved like angels this anime wouldn't be anywhere near as good!\\n\\n\r\nI also love the side characters. I love watching Garterbelt scream at Panty and Stocking for not doing their jobs, I love how Brief is so hopelessly in love with Panty, and Panty and Stocking's enemies, Skanty and Kneesocks, I love them too because they're the complete opposite of Panty and Stocking as in they're both behaved, polite, intelligent, and demonic.\\n\\n\r\nI would've liked this anime more if it was a slice-of-life instead of action. My favorite episode of the anime is when Panty and Stocking just spend the whole episode just hanging out in their living room eating junk food and watching TV. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the one thing I didn't like about this anime was the gross-out humor. Panty and Stocking fight a ghost made of poop, a ghost made of snot, a ghost made of sperm, a ghost made of vomit, a ghost that ate people's underwear, and a ghost that shot milk from her boobs. That was too over the top for my taste :(\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you are at least 17 years old, then watch this anime immediately! It was funny and it had great unforgettable characters! Also, make sure you keep watching to the end because the ending is amazing! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Gainax decides to take on Western media and produces some interesting results.\r\nAs always, my reviews are spoiler free.\r\nStory - 3/10\r\nPanty and Stocking, a pair of angel sisters are rejected from heaven due to their questionable natures.  In order to get back in, they must kill ghosts to collect heaven coins.  It seems like a pretty simple story, and that's because it is; each episode (with a few exceptions) is divided into two halves, each killing a ghost wreaking some sort of havoc in the city.  This havoc is usually directly involved with some sort of crude humor (the tissue factory has beentaken over so men can't \"relieve their frustrations, all of the city's sewer waste has been possessed, etc.).  Panty and Stocking will show up and, with an interesting incantation and poll-dancing mahou shoujo transformation sequence, destroy the ghost with their weapons made out of their... panties and stockings.  There really isn't so much fighting as their are one liners.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is a comedy anime, but not the average one.  It relies almost entirely on dirty jokes, which can get old pretty quickly.  On the other side of the heaven coin, however, there are many witty scenes and parodies to appreciate.  A favorite of mine was sperm soldiers assaulting a beach with a certain \"mound\" being their final goal.  Therefore, we have a mixed bag of stale sex and bathroom humor and relatively thoughtful parody, although the former certainly dominates the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is totally different from any other anime I have seen.  Many say it is like South Park, but I would say it looks much closer to cartoons like Invader Zim.  It is likely going to be a very polarizing factor, but I liked it.  They will occasionally change the art style to a more traditional anime or chibi style for various purposes (meaning sex appeal or comedy).  Overall, I liked the change of pace, with a nice color pallet and comic book sound effects written into the backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you enjoy the humor or animation of the show, most people would agree that the soundtrack for this show is superb.  I want to also mention in this section that the dub would be far superior to native English speakers.  I found the Japanese audio with subtitles to be totally unfunny, but the banter between Panty and Stocking is much more entertaining in English, profanity and all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nPanty, Stocking, and Garterbelt are not particularly good characters in their own right.  However, when they are combined together, the situations they get themselves into can prompt some hilarious dialog.  The arguments between the sisters are brutal but funny, and Garterbelt's attempts to keep the two in check never go as planned.  Each of the characters has a few overarching personality traits.  Panty is completely sex crazed (her goaling being to sleep with 1000 men on earth before returning to heaven) and lazy in her ghost killing duties.  Stocking's adoration for sweets is unbelievable, but she is the more serious of the two in both daily life and ghost killing.  While she is not a total whore like Panty, she shows strange interest in the opposite sex and is into some exotic bedroom activities, like bondage and electrocution.  Garterbelt doesn't act like the priest he is in any way, other than the stereotype of enjoying... younger company.  Together, they make a good comedy trio.  The other characters are essentially useless.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5?/10\\n\\n\r\nHow much you enjoy this show will depend entirely on how much you like the characters and if you like the crude humor.  I liked the characters, but not so much the humor.  \\n\\n\r\nOther Thoughts\\n\\n\r\n-You will probably like this show if you enjoy Western cartoon aimed towards adults.  \\n\r\n-It contains a large amount of crude humor, foul language, and sexual themes.\\n\r\n-Watch the dub (another strange exception to my Japanese language preference).",

            "content": "Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt is the most obscene, vulgar, and over the top anime that I\u2019ve ever seen. That is what makes this series so unique and enjoyable. It does, and says things that you\u2019d never expect to see in an anime, and it does it all really well. But with that said, Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt is not without its problems.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story in this series revolves around the Anarchy sisters, Panty and Stocking. They are angels that got kicked out of heaven because couldn\u2019t follow the rules. A handler named Garterbelt accompanies them on their mission to obtain the currency of heavencalled Heaven Coins. Their goal is to collect enough Heaven Coins to buy there way back into heaven, but the only way to obtain the coins is by killing ghosts. The story of this series is really difficult to judge. Not only because the actual plot of the anime is very simple and straightforward, but also because it is comedy series. And not just any comedy series, but it\u2019s a parody comedy series. Each episode is named after a movie or television series. Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt will take elements and ideas from those shows and movies, and implement them into the episodes. They chose from a variety of different types of series\u2019, from High School Musical, to Night of the Living Dead. If you\u2019ve seen the particular show or movie, it makes the episode that much more funny to watch. But that\u2019s not the only reason I considered it a parody. The series could be taken just as an anime portrayal or parody of the western animation style and humor, but it\u2019s a little deeper than that. This series also juxtaposes several elements and themes throughout the series. From angels that aren\u2019t very angelic, to demons that aren\u2019t incredibly demonic. The animation itself is in contrast to the themes of the show. While this series is animated like something you\u2019d see on the Cartoon Network on Saturday mornings, the language and themes used in the series are far from kid friendly. Even with a plot that isn\u2019t incredibly original or complex, the comedy, and contrast that the show provides makes it extremely interesting and engaging. With all of that said, the ending of the story was terrible. The story had flowed very nicely and was on the road to a satisfying conclusion, but at the last minute they decided to ruin it by throwing in a cliffhanger as a tease for the next season. And since, to my knowledge, there is no news about the second season, there will probably never be any sort of resolution for the gigantic curve ball they threw us at the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this series is obviously inspired by American animation, and it is really well done. The animation reminds me of shows that I would watch on Saturday mornings when I younger. While the style isn\u2019t what you would typically see in an anime, it really fits this series well. The characters and backgrounds are both animated really well, but the best parts of the animation are the fight scenes. Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt was produced by Gainax, the same studio that produced Gurren Lagann, so it\u2019s safe to say that they are used producing some crazy and over the top action scenes. They also mix in some more traditional anime style animation, as well as live action explosions at the end of each battle, which adds to the comedic effect of the show. The entire series is all really well animated and entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this series is excellent. It\u2019s definitely something that I\u2019ve never heard in an anime before. It\u2019s a mixture of dance and electronic, which are two genres of music that I\u2019ve never really listened to. This show served as a good introduction to those genres of music, and I really enjoyed it. The music also really fits the overall style of the show, as well as the tone and atmosphere of the scenes where they are used. The opening and ending are both really well done. They both are catchy, and really enjoyable to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis series has four main characters. Panty, a sex addict who is able to transform her panties into ghost slaying pistols, Stocking, Panty\u2019s sister, who has a serious love of anything sweet, and can transform her stockings into swords, their handler, Garterbelt, who is a priest with a violent past and questionable interests, and Briefers, a want-a-be ghost hunter who has a crush on Panty. Instead of giving these characters a lot of development, this series gives them all lots of personality. The characters are all very funny and likable. The way the characters interact with each other is hilarious, and very fun to watch. There are several side and supporting characters, but most of them are only in one or two episodes. The ones that show up multiple times also have lots of personality and are very fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nPanty & Stocking with Garterbelt was a breath of fresh air for the comedy anime genre, and I really enjoyed watching it. It isn\u2019t trying to be anything really deep, or thought provoking; it\u2019s just pure entertainment. Even though it wasn\u2019t anything spectacular, the way it contrasted several different things in the series did give me something to think about while I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict & Breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3.2/5\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 4/5\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4.4/5\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3.5/5\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3.8/5\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 3.8/5\\n\\n\r\nPanty & Stocking with Garterbelt isn\u2019t for everyone, but if you can tolerate ridiculous amounts of vulgarity, sexual jokes, a story that isn\u2019t serious, you should definitely give this series a try.",

            "content": "Now, Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is not your typical anime.  This is one of the most profane and dirty shows I haved watched probably in my entire lifetime, but you know what, it works.  Panty and Stocking is one of those shows you're uncomfortable with watching at first, but then you just accept the fact that you're watching something of its caliber.  Gainax, you truly know how to experiment.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nNow I know I shouldn't be expecting much from a comedy show, and I didn't going in.  Every episode is a new little story that tells us of the coarse adventuresthat Panty and Stocking go on regularly.  Now there are recurring plot points (I mean if you could even call them that) that pop up here and then.  For example, starting with episode 6, the two demon sisters, Scanty and Kneesocks, make appearances here and there in future episodes.  By episode 12, we get a new plotpoint where Corset, the mayor of the city, wants the find Hell's monkey, whose key is in the form of Brief's genitalia.  This key basically releases the forces of hell itself onto earth and whatnot, but I don't want to get into too much details.  It was trying to aim for I guess a half decent plot at the end, but what I'm I saying?  We are dealing with the studio infamous for bad endings.  Who knows if we'll ever see a P&S season 2?\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\n\"Oh the nerve!\" You're probably thinking as you type away furiously at the keyboard.  \"This art is awful! How could you give it anything higher than mediocrity!\"  Well kind sir, I'll tell ya.  Gainax was trying to make it have an American type artwork.  I mean, this show is far from Japanese, I assure you.  It parodies a lot of different artwork in the show like the old G1 Transformers, Southpark, and the very Powerpuff Girls style that is prevalent throughout the show.  It depicts a popular view of what the Japanese think of our culture.  Now I know it's not the most appealing to the eyes, and that's why I'm not giving it masterpiece status.  When going into this show, try to understand what they were going for, and above all pay attention more to the humor than the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nStarting with the intro, I think it brings a nice atmosphere to what this show is about to unravel for your little mind: sex, profanity, and much more.  It's simple lyrics and flashy colors bring you into the moment, for what you're about to experience is something you have never seen before in an anime.  The ending credits is a nice serene and catchy song that kept me from skipping it at the end of the episode.  Now this is coming from a guy who will skip any end outro just from hearing a couple seconds from it.  So this was a nice change of pace.  The songs within the show could be hit or miss.  One song will have you listen to the very promiscuous sounds of a girl moaning, and really no other song really stood out to me.  I'd say definitely my favorite of the bunch was the song that played during P&S's transformation scene, \"Fly Away.\"  A very catchy song that fit the two angels to a tee.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10 \\n\r\nThe characters in this show were great.  I wanna say I enjoyed every single character in the show.  By far, my favorite was Garterbelt.  I mean who doesn't love a big black preacher who has the Lord in his heart, but still swears like a sailor and is into bondage.  I know I did.  Between the two sisters, I think Panty wins by just a minimal amount.  A sex obsessed angel who's not afraid to get down to business when the time comes, she definitely proves to get my vote between these two characters.  Nothing against Stocking, I just think she was a bit underplayed.  Most of the shine went towards Panty, and when Stocking did get screen-time it was only for a short amount of time before Panty started to do her thing.  The two sisters were a nice add-on to the rest of the series and proved to be just as good of characters as P&S.  Brief, well, he's just kinda there.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI didn't know too much about what I was getting myself into, until I was finally into it.  I thoroughly enjoyed this show and found myself laughing at many of the inappropriate moments in the episodes.  This was a treat to myself considering it broke the usual norms of an anime and gave me something a little more fresh this summer.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 8/10\\n\r\nDefinitely check out this show if you haven't already.  You won't regret the time you put into watching this hilarity.  It's only 13 episodes, so you don't have much to lose, am I right? This is one of those shows to watch with friends just to get a kick out of all the sex jokes ans so forth.  Oh and keep this far away from your parents, trust me.  You'll thank me later.\\n\\n\r\nHave a wondrous day.",

            "content": "You think you\u2019ve seen everything in entertainment that would make you wide eyed in disbelief in its various forms of hedonism and debauchery? I\u2019ve got one show for you to feast your eyes on and, to no surprise, it is thanks to Gainax,  by the lead people who were responsible for Gurren Lagann unsurprisingly. The name of this title is Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. Now if you think I use the terms hedonism and debauchery in any negative fashion, trust me when I say, it molds those two things into one glorious package.\r\nA way to describe Panty and Stocking in a nutshell isto think of the show as Japan\u2019s answer to western animated TV shows, particularly in America. They are open about it right to the aesthetics of the animation and art style it encompasses that feel right at home to some of Gainax\u2019s more wackier creations. Directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi, creator of the aforementioned Gurren Lagann and Kill La Kill, he has once again managed to pull off more of his balls out creativity with Panty and Stocking. The imaginative process that he most likely had in mind for Panty and Stocking would be, \u201cWhat if I made a sexual and vulgar version of a Looney Tunes cartoon?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIf you were to watch it all verbatim, there are some influences of those cartoons in terms of how the humor is displayed in its pacing and visuals. Jokes that involve, say, having sex with multiple guys at once, abortion, strippers, masturbation, gluttony, and toilet humor aren\u2019t exactly for the faint of heart. Fast-paced animation fits very well with that style of humor because of the overall nature to those aspects all combined together. Especially since the humor is generally featuring slapstick antics between characters. With Panty and Stocking, it manages to make most of the jokes work without having them rely on redundant situations each episodes. They all depend on the racy writing and how they intertwine them with witty charisma from our two main protagonists and the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nI would start by analyzing the plot of Panty and Stocking as I do with every review, but what plot is there to be given this treatment? This is, by and large, an episodic formula that mostly follows among two parts each episode that follow a specific type of theme. There\u2019s not much in terms of character growth for Panty or Stocking, but it is, in essence, a show that wants to be up-in-your-face with its attempts at being crazy and nonsensical. Normally this would serve as a problem if the comedy only works half the time, yet Panty and Stocking manages to prove itself exceptional to this rule. I\u2019ve already mentioned in detail how great the humor works and it does not skip a lot of beats in keeping them feeling fresh. Hell, there is one plot arc that just involves Panty and Stocking sitting on a couch doing nothing but going about their day. No extreme battles take place, no nothing, and it managed to still be delightfully humorous as the rest considering that it\u2019s so different in tone.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters range from the painfully awkward and downright insane in the personality range. Either way, most of them possess many qualities from their personalities to make them lovable, at least with our two main ladies. That is not to say the rest are mediocre by any stretch but they are not as attention-grabbing visually or verbally speaking. Garterbelt is still good from his pretty funny attempts at trying to keep both Panty and Stocking in check from having too much fun from their respective duties. The \u201cnerd\u201d of the cast, Rock Briefers, is funny on occasion, especially with one moment involving him on a toilet. Numerous side characters crop up from every direction and fill in their roles with the amount of screentime they are needed.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the main dish of the course, Panty and Stocking, the girls themselves, that is. They embody the entirety of what makes the show phenomenal from beginning to end. Their constant barrage of quick and snappy dialogue are always a splendor to experience. Excess in sexual body fluids and constantly berating each other for their physical appearance are but a few that these two have to offer. Even with the moments that might make them, in hindsight, unlikable from the context of their actions, they still invoke stellar charm in their chemistry. What is also noticeably poignant to them is their voice actresses, which I would argue are great both in the English and Japanese dubbed tracks.\\n\\n\r\nAfter mentioning how the art and animation helps the humor by themselves, they are very unique compared to what most anime studios generally draw. I also like how it\u2019ll sometimes morph characters into different sizes based on what is happening at that particular moment. Sometimes they are small and chibi and sexually drawn in a realistic fashion when they do that striptease transformation sequence. Making it have a multifaceted look lets Panty and Stocking feel special in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nTo say that Panty and Stocking shows no boundaries is an understatement at the utmost highest level. Anyone with the tolerance levels of vulgarity at the lowest level possible would most likely drop the show from the very first minute of it. With the lengths it goes to shock people, it is hard to not admire it for doing so. Many conceive comedy to have the tendency to go far with its material and delve deeper to the point where it almost makes the audience uncomfortable, which makes a good comedy a brilliant one. The only thing that keeps Panty and Stocking from being perfect is that it didn\u2019t go far enough.",

If you haven't remember or paid attention to the details of it, it's very much no connecting story for every episode; as each episode had its own scenario for itself, and did not drag on.

So yes, your cartoons as a kid, did finally grow up along with you.\r\nTo be forewarned, Panty and Stocking are not for the faint of heart, or even the intelligent. As GAINAX is clearly making the point that this is clearlya man's anime, it does have a manly intellect behind it. Violence, sex, sexy characters, bad language, humor, and no confusing storyline to have you needing a score card to keep track of the events. If you even object to any of the mentioned, you might want to reconsider watching this series, because it contains a massive amounts of the mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nThis is, overall, the best anime I have seen for 2010.

            "content": "Warning:  this review contains some foul language.  If you can't handle that, then this review is over...  don't watch Panty and Stocking.\r\nPanty and Stocking with Garterbelt... A title I\u2019m going to shorten from this point on... Is a show about two angels who\u2019ve been expelled from heaven, and must destroy ghosts in order to be accepted back through the pearly gates. They follow the lead of a mysterious black priest named Garterbelt, who shelters them, manages them, and aids them in finding their targets. However, now that they\u2019re living new lives as mortals, what will be more important to them... Their questto return to their old home, or the vices and sinful pleasures of their new home?\\n\\n\r\nOur central character is Panty Anarchy, the older of the two sisters. She\u2019s obsessed with sex, and has become addicted to the feeling of human intercourse. Her weapon, appropriately, is a pair of panties that can turn into an angelic gun. Her little sister is Stocking Anarchy, who has become obsessed with sugary sweets, which she consumes almost as voraciously as Panty consumes men. They\u2019re both greedy, selfish, arrogant, basically the exact opposite of how you\u2019d expect an angel to act.\\n\\n\r\nThey have a dog named Chuck, who is constantly abused, thereby justifying his existence. They also obtain a sidekick named Brief, an introverted virgin boy who acts as the group\u2019s moral center, to absolutely no avail. Their manager, Garterbelt, is a priest, and... Do I really need to explain him any further than that?\\n\\n\r\nTheir archenemies, Scanty and Kneesock, are a pair of demonic sisters, who oddly act like the exact opposite of our heroes... Stuck up, reserved, dignified, but just as selfish and arrogant.\\n\\n\r\nSo, hearing this plot description, you\u2019re probably thinking that a bunch of bored, overworked middle-aged men must have come up with this scenario via committee while drunk off their asses. And if you\u2019re thinking that, well... Yes. That\u2019s exactly what this is, and that\u2019s exactly what happened.\\n\\n\r\nThe Gainax team took a well deserved vacation after they wrapped their work on Gurren Lagann, they all came up with this gem while drinking together. The plot, the characters, and almost every other detail was cooked up by people too wasted to cook, and yes, that includes the art style and tone.\\n\\n\r\nLike all alcohol fuelled get-togethers, the conversation inevitably diverted towards dirty jokes and adult humor, which they of course decided would be the focus of the show. They committed themselves to it, and if nothing else, you have to admire their tenacity. Panty and Stocking is vulgar all the way through, containing more fucks and shits than any televised show could be expected to have. They used these words in English to get them past the Japanese censors, but even without the foul language, there are entire episodes devoted to sex, bodily fluids, and often both.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for those of you who\u2019ve gotten this far into the review while thinking the material may be tastefully done, think again... Taste, as it turns out, is the one word that seems to have been banned from the script. Unless of course Panty\u2019s complaining that her food would taste better with some jizz on it.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an episode where they fight a shit ghost... One where they fight a puke ghost... There\u2019s a nose picking ghost who they have to fight with their nosebleeds... And yet the only episode that ever offended me was the one where they have to fight a platoon of sperm ghosts who died storming the beaches of vaginal Normandy. Don\u2019t blame me for being offended, I have a Grandpa who fought in that war.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this approach isn\u2019t the fact that it\u2019s offensive... It\u2019s that it isn\u2019t funny. The humor relies entirely on shocking you, but it doesn\u2019t take long for that shock to wear off, and the content on screen to become... Well, dull, if you can believe it. And since the actual writing is bare bones and lazy at best, that shock value is really the only thing it has to try and keep you engaged with.\\n\\n\r\nWell, almost. There\u2019s also the art style, which is based primarily on the work of Genndy Tartakovsky. Think outlines, bright colors, consistent angles, and character designs that could almost trick you into thinking it was flash animated. And that\u2019s not the only western property that Panty and Stocking touches on... The references to western culture are constant and merciless, with America as it\u2019s favorite plaything. There are entire episodes playing around with Romero movies, Michael Bay\u2019s Transformers reboot, and even a late nod towards X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Episode titles will be puns on American movies, even when the episode itself has nothing to do with said movie.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime that tries it\u2019s damnedest to inspire cries of \u2018What the Fuck,\u2019 the only WTF question it really deserves to be asked is \u2018Why the Fuck?\u201d It isn\u2019t so much \u2018What the Fuck are they doing, it\u2019s \u2018Why the Fuck are They Doing It?\u2019 As well as, \u2018What the Fuck Were They Trying to Accomplish?\u2019 And the answer, I believe, comes back to Excel Saga.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to believe one of those Gainax executives was an Excel Saga fan. Because this show reeks of Excel Saga.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, take a look at the similarities. You have two eccentric heroines, a blonde-haired extrovert and a blue-haired introvert with larger breasts (Excel and Hyatt) who work for a mysterious individual who\u2019s constantly assigning them bizarre missions (Il Palazzo), and they have an abnormal dog who\u2019s always in constant danger (Menchi, although he looks like Gir), and they eventually take on a third member who has trouble fitting in with them as they consistently get abused... And come from a surprisingly affluent background... (El Gala, for those of you who read the manga). And they have to battle an opposing syndicate lead by a corrupt mayor(OH FUCKING COME ON!). The difference is that instead of being well-meaning girls who are out to conquer the city, we have self-serving girls who are out to save the city.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this blatantly obvious... Um, we\u2019ll call it an influence... Isn\u2019t always a bad thing. I may criticize it for probably stealing it\u2019s basic plot structure from Excel Saga, but if there\u2019s one thing I can give it credit for, it\u2019s for successfully stealing it\u2019s bold, experimental tone as well. Excel Saga was a blank slate anime that used every episode to do something entirely different, depending on the whims of it\u2019s creators. It would drive it\u2019s unique characters through absurd situations on some days, and lampoon the crap out of another series/genre on the other day. Panty and Stocking is the only anime I can think of that was able to steal this tone, and make it their own.\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned before, I have no ear for Anime music. But I loved this anime\u2019s music. There\u2019s a lot of electronic music in this title, and while I don\u2019t know enough about electronic music to describe it very well at all, I can say that I found it very enjoyable. Even the autotuned tracks... And there are many... Are ridiculously catchy. But the highlight, for me, was the ending theme, an entirely english song called Fallen Angel. I\u2019ll let the song speak for itself, but I honestly can\u2019t see any other song working as well when placed in the background of an ending video that features chibi bobbleheads in a number of perilous situations. The result is just... Adorkable. A word I don\u2019t even like.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, we have the English dub. Good lord, do we have the English dub.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub takes the vulgarity of the series, as well as the pop culture references, and cranks them up to eleven. And after hearing how much Jamie Marchi enjoys reading her extra-perverse lines, it doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that she\u2019s the one who wrote the damn thing. Mostly.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I love Jamie Marchi as an actor... For the record, I think the majority of her performances are fun and full of life... I\u2019ve never liked her as a script writer. I think she\u2019s one of those rare writers whose quality declines if she\u2019s given too much freedom with it. I already talked about her in my Yamada\u2019s first Time reviews, calling her one of the most try-hardiest writers in the anime genre, and with the amount of dirty jokes and movie quotes she managed to jam into this dub, I can imagine her primary tool being not a pen, but a crowbar. although the engrish swearing in the sub was pretty damn funny, I only laughed about a dozen times while watching the dub... Which consists of thirteen episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe casting is perfect, the actors do their best, but in the end, no amount of sincerity can make it sound like anything other than suppressed writers laughing at their own jokes. you simply can\u2019t saver writing that\u2019s this bad.\\n\\n\r\nAll vulgarity and no wit makes Panty and Stocking a dull boy.\\n\\n\r\nOh, while we\u2019re on the subject of the dub, this one kills me as a voice-chaser, as it\u2019s a prime example of Cherami Leigh mimicking Luci Christian\u2019s voice.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I fail to appreciate this anime as a comedy, I actually really respect it from an artistic perspective, and i\u2019m not just talking about the addictive art and animation style. By following Excel Saga\u2019s experimental example, Panty and Stocking makes room for some surprisingly bold artistic decisions. The art style becomes hyper-realistic during the puke episode, a brief change that will leave many first time viewers wondering if they\u2019ve wandered into a different show. There\u2019s an entire episode done in one continuous shot, save for some time skips. And my favorite episode of all is Chuck to the Future, an episode where the dog Chuck goes through what can only be called a David Lynch style story, told through barely any dialogue, as he battles his arch-nemesis Fastener. And since they had time left over after this segment, the writers just said \u201cFuck it,\u201d and did a music video that parodies a huge chunk of the western popular music scene.\\n\\n\r\nBut that loose style also carries a huge drawback. The thing I hate the most about this show is that it knows how plotless and irrelevant it is, and by coating itself in a thick shell of non-existent fucks, it safeguards itself from criticism. you can\u2019t ask why the writing is so bad, because it\u2019s Panty and Stocking. You can\u2019t ask why there\u2019s so much about it that doesn\u2019t make any sense, because it\u2019s Panty and Stocking. You can\u2019t bring any arguments about consistency, logic, continuity, or character development because it\u2019s fucking Panty and Stocking!\\n\\n\r\nOne of the creators has cited Drawn Together(and other adult cartoons) as a primary inspiration for the vulgarity and overall tone this show, but considering how little fucks it gives about it\u2019s own presentation, I\u2019d be a little quicker to finger Tom Green as it\u2019s inspiration. It doesn\u2019t try to give us anything more than whatever the fuck it wants to give us, and in doing so, it can\u2019t possibly fail. And in a weird way, as much I hate this, I can actually kind of respect it.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and there\u2019s also an eight minute OVA called Sanitarybox, but it\u2019s entirely pointless, and if you don\u2019t want to think about discarded foreskins every time you eat a Funion, don\u2019t even bother with it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Panty and Stocking will be different things to different people. Some of us will find it hilarious, some of us will find it an intriguing art piece, and some of us will just roll our eyes and be alienated the entire time. As far as i\u2019m concerned, these are all valid reactions to one of the most original anime shows to come out in the last decade. It looks great, despite it\u2019s best efforts, and it sounds great, also despite it\u2019s best efforts, and even if you can\u2019t call it enjoyable, if nothing else, you can at least call it unforgettable.\\n\\n\r\nI give Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt a 6/10.  \\n\\n",

            "content": "ah Panty & Stocking, probably one of the most controversial shows from Gainax in quite a while, and since they made good ol' Evangelion, that's saying quite a bit. P&SwG at heart is a love-letter/parody/pastiche/you name it/ to/of Western pop culture. Filled to the brim with toilet humor, references, asinine plot elements and even more inane characters, it's like I sat down to watch some animu and ended up watching something on Adult Swim/Comedy Central. Is it a show everyone can enjoy? Definitely not, it's pretty  much cut right down in the middle between lovers: people who absolutely adore it and everything it standsfor, and haters; people who wonder how this show even managed to crawl its way out of the depraved minds of the people who thought this insanity up. Will you enjoy it? You can probably just watch the first 2 minutes or so of the first episode and decide whether its an anime for you or not. Unlike many other shows, Panty & Stocking won't win over the people who didn't like it in the later episodes, but at the same time it will not alienate the people who originally liked it when it started up. It doesn't make any compromises and sticks to its guns through thick and thin. Still it's not possible to write off all the flaws simply because its different, nor is it possible to write off the show entirely for its presentation. It can be looked at through an *GASP* objective point of view despite being absurdity-incarnate.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the art and animation. It's been stated maaany times before, but the art is a fusion of the classic PowerPuff Girls and Dead Leaves with a tinge of South Park thrown in for good measure. The result? A wildly memorable art design and a slick sense of style. Yes they look like something out of a Western cartoon but that's definitely not a bad thing in my book, rather it makes the whole thing stick out from the rest of the generic shit that gets pumped out year after year. Gainax being the enormous fanboys of Western culture as they are, shamelessly throw in god-knows how many references to cartoons such as Courage the Cowardly Dog, Samurai Jack and even Ren & Stimpy. In this regard, I'd consider PSG to be quite the innovation at least in its art and content, something that hasn't been seen in Japan since well.....ever. Not that its the first of its kind, Dead Leaves had tread this ground years ago, and Gainax has always been doing wacked out stuff for as long as its been in the business. Nevertheless, PSG still manages to be fresh and bold with its simplistic and outrageous artstyle. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation...oh lord where to begin...\\n\\n\r\nI can imagine it now, right when Hiroyuki Imaishi had the brain fart that created this travesty. He rounded up all of the giants among Gainax's in-house animators and proposed to them PSG's premise and let them off their leashes. Yup, similar to Parallel Works, we've had just about every notable animator over at Gainax giving their shot at PSG, even getting some notable freelancers such Ryotimo and Hironori Tananka to do some directing and animating. Basically they all got together, circle-jerked onto some paper and called it animation. The result is JEEBUS CUHRISHT GLORIOUS!!!!!111!!1! Easily some of the most colorful, high-frame, excellently directed and cut animation I've seen all year. Half the freaking hype for this show came from the sakugafags who were frothing at the mouth just thinking about the prospective animation staff for the next episode. I take my hat off to Gainax, they really do a good job with the animation and never fail to disappoint in this category in their original works. A special note for the CGI work that was done, especially in episodes 6, 10 and 13. Its the single most impressive implementation of 3D with 2D animation I've ever seen. Obviously Gainax is known to work some magic with 3D animation but they really outdid themselves here. I didn't even notice how many of the car-on-car action scenes were 3D until someone pointed it out, it's THAT good! The only other anime I can think of that has animators going crazy this year is probably Tatami Galaxy (another great anime worth checking out).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound needs no real praise from me since its been universally praised to hell and back. I'm jumping on the bandwagon and saying that its equally as excellent as the visual design. All the tracks that get played are memorable and that's definitely something worth commending. The techno is FABULOUS~ and really accentuate the whimsical nature of the show. All the tracks are overflowing with energy, hell I catch myself singing some of songs under my breath everyone now and then. The OST comes out on the 29th, so get your wallets/piratin into gear, it'll be one helluva an OST to remember. Fly away now~, Fly away now~, FLY AWAY!~\\n\r\nOn a similar note, all the voice actors/actresses did a terrific job with the script (or lack of). What I really enjoyed is the fact that Panty & Stocking themselves had very unique voices despite me having heard the same VAs in different roles. A shout out to all the Engrish that went into this show, it made some of the scenes hysterical (looking at the zombie episode in particular!), ah the Japanese cussing in Engrish, it truly never gets old.   \\n\\n\r\nNow lets wind this down and come to some of the problems I had with the show concerning the characters and plot. \"Plot\" he says? \"Character\" he says? \"In PSG\" he says? Yeah I'm off my rocker but hear me out for a second. PSG is structured like most Western cartoons in that it's split into mini-episodes into the 24-minute run. So in reality most episodes were about 11 minutes in length, 2 per airing. So each episode has a radically different director, storyboard, and content to it. What does create? You named it, a rather large fluctuation in quality and a lack of consistency. Don't get me wrong, this style is largely what made PSG so different in the first place and its probably PSG's greatest strength. This structure allows for each director to be experimental and that's arguably what makes up PSG's strongest episodes. Episodes like \"Vomiting Point\", \"Nothing to Room\" and \"Once Upon a Time in Garterbelt\" are examples of this, and what a haphazard style of directing can create. On the flip side, its also its biggest weakness as this style can create episodes with little to no direction and lack of coherence, episodes like \"The Runny\", \"If Angels wore Swimsuits\" and segments of \"Chuck to the Future\" are examples of the latter. Nonsensical events and shenanigans is what this show is about and is good at. It works up till a certain degree, until it becomes too much and stale.Which is why plot and direction become exceedingly important, it keeps things moving and changes everything up, maintaining a firm grip on the audience's attention. Consider episode 6 \"Les Diaboliques\". It was a perfect mesh of good sound design and appropriate tracks at the right times, awesome animation during the climax and subsequent fights, a balance between crazy and well-written humor (RUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRs anyone?), and just enough direction and plot intrigue (the introduction of the Demon Sisters). Best of all, I didn't feel that they sacrificed anything in favor of the madness that made up such a large part of previous episodes. Rather this madness was still there but actually had rhyme and reason to it now. Thinking back to it, IMO its the best episode of any anime this year. A great example of what could (and could not be) done with this show.\\n\\n\r\nFast-forward to the finale, and I was absolutely ecstatic at what was going to happen after what episode 12 had set-up. This would be episode 6 but a much larger scale right? Going back to the idea that PSG needed to strike a balance between its more absurd qualities and a more tried-and-true approach, it makes it all the more frustrating to see them find that balance as demonstrated in episode 6 only to get lost in their own cesspool of ideas during the finale. It wasn't bad by any stretch of the word but it was underwhelming compared to what episode 6 had accomplished before it. Without any coherence, everything was just a whole load of Gainax animators animating their insanity before I could properly register the hell I ended up watching. I can only remember awesome bits and pieces that happened in 13, if you asked me describe the whole episode in detail, I'd be hard-pressed to think of a proper synopsis. In effect, the whole thing was a blur to me, in contrast I can pretty much describe all the scenes in episode 6 quite well. That sums up my gripes with PSG, a lack of consistency (which could not have been avoided given its structure) and a lack of proper direction (could have been dealt with). Its nice to see all the Gainax animators working up a frenzy to create some mind-blowing material but sometimes it really ends up being their own scribbles. \\n\\n\r\nAnd a final mention of the last two minutes, those moments were just Gainax being so unabashedly Gainax that it was truly a sight to behold (we don't get much of that these days so cherish it!). I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't get a second season since this is Gainax we're talking about but I'd absolutely love to see more. Despite my personal feelings on the subject, this show was a breath of fresh air and reminded me how much fun anime could be. Yeah it could have been better, but than again, it was already incredibly entertaining and charming (never thought I'd use that word to describe this anime) to begin with.",

            "content": "Vulgar humor has long been a controversial form of comedy. Bible-thumping conservative call it \"immoral.\" Politically-correct liberals call it \"offensive.\" And a good number of people in the middle call it \"immature.\" However, I think that if done right, dirty shows such as South Park can indeed be quite funny. Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt is one of these shows.\r\nThat said, this anime is definitely not for everyone. If you hate shows like Family Guy or Ren & Stimpy, I can't possibly imagine you'd like PSG.\r\nThe story (well, I'd call it more a concept than a story) is basically about these two ultra bitchy angelsthat get kicked out of heaven, and need to collect heaven coins to buy their way back. An episode usually has about 2 stories each, similar to shows like Spongebob or The Fairly Odd Parents. Like I said, it's more of a concept. There's no character development or plot twists. There's no sense of continuity, so it's perfectly fine to watch it out of order.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, PSG is full of over the top action. Panty uses her panties that transform into a pistol, while Stocking uses her, you guessed it, stockings that transform into katanas. If that's not crazy enough for you, there's also the monsters-of-the-week. One of them is literally a massive glob of shit.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also full of ecchi moments. I'm not really a fan of the ecchi genre, but in PSG it's meant to be played for laughs instead of be erotic.\\n\\n\r\nSo let's talk about the characters. PSG has a very colorful cast of characters. There's the titular Panty and Stocking. Panty is obsessed with sex, and Stocking is obsessed with sweets. Like I said before, they're complete skanks. Despite that, I found them to be very enjoyable characters. I guess it's because they seem to parody the \"Jersey Shore\" type girls that the mainstream media tries to idolize these days.  Stocking is my personal favorite, mainly because of her character design. I LOVE her hair. :3\\n\\n\r\nThe next to characters that stick out in my mind are Scanty and Kneesocks. They are devils with similar abilities to Panty and Stocking. I find them really ironic, and that definitely added to my enjoyment of this anime. Devils are commonly associated with chaos and lust. And in PSG, the devils are all about rules and order. Meanwhile, angels are associates with rules and order while the angels in PSG are constantly causing chaos and having sex.\\n\\n\r\nThe one criticism I have for Scanty and Kneesocks though is that they're never really separated as characters. They're not much different in terms of personality. You never think of them as \"Scanty\" and \"Kneesocks\" but as \"Scanty & Kneesocks.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe only character I don't really like is Chuck. He's supposed to be an expy of GIR from Invader Zim. And even though I love GIR, I found Chuck to be more stupid than funny. I flat out hated the episode dedicated to him.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most notable things about PSG, aside from the humor, is the art style. The show as a LOT of western influence. At a first glance, you might think it was something out of the minds of The Powerpuff Girls. However, what really amazed me the most was when the art shifts to a more traditional anime style, such as the transformation sequences. They contrast heavily with the super-deformed characters and the cel-shaded coloring that the show usually boasts, but they look beautiful and add to the humor. Gainax really outdid themselves with the art in PSG.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in PSG is amazing. The music is insanely catchy. My personal favorites are \"Fly Away\" and the ED theme \"Fallen Angel.\" The Japanese voice work is also stellar. In terms of the English dub, most of the cast is good, but I honestly did not like Stocking's English voice at all. Her voice sounded kinda raspy and she didn't sound cute or moe like she did in the Japanese original. Monica Rial is a good voice actress, but PSG certainly isn't the best example.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed watching this show. But not every moment. I mentioned I didn't like the episode focusing on Chuck. I was also a little grossed out by the episodes about shit and semen. And then there's the episode about this one office worker guy. The art is shifted to intentionally make everyone look unappealing. I wouldn't say I disliked this episode, but it was still kinda icky.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, this anime isn't for everyone. If you're expecting anything mature from this show, don't even consider it. But if it doesn't bother you, Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt is a great example of a show that successfully pulls off dirty jokes and sexual humor.",

            "content": "The main outlines of this show are angels, getting Heaven coins to go back to Heaven. However, the lack of creativity within the episodes are absolutely dreadful, so they have to parody other popular show in order to get better publicity. The characters are also major stereotypes and have no real plot devlopment thrown at them, just make them completely one-sided and that's it. Going back to the story, there's not much devlopment for the characters or story, which proves to have a bunch of pointless and uninteresting fillers. Also, the main \"humor\" parts of the show are sexual references, not like the occasional sexjoke, this show is swamped with them, and engrish. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think the story is bad, uncreative, and does not put up to the standard it set. The animation is pretty good, as the characters are colorful, but strays from it at times and make it look either lazy or sexual. Some of the music was enjoyable, but there were annoying sound effects that have to go with it and therefore ruin the couple good tracks altogether.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this show, unless you're the type of person that thinks parodies of overrated shows, mixed in with bad story development, sex jokes and people of different language trying to say english is funny.",

            "content": "Well. This was an experience. \r\nPSG is essentially Powerpuff Girls meets South Park, without the social commentary (mostly). The vulgarity is ramped up to 11--so much so that at parts it even made me a bit uncomfortable. (Not an easy thing to do!) If you think that today's crop of adult TV animation is boundary-pushing, then you haven't seen anything yet. The series follows two fallen angels (Panty and Stocking) as they attempt to buy their way back into heaven by eliminating numerous earthly 'ghosts,' which are constructed from the regrets of those who have died. Unfortunately, a lot of these regrets are based aroundvarious unsavory elements, which means that Panty and Stocking, when they're not clashing with one another, are fighting giant shit monsters, giant snot monsters, giant vomit monsters, giant lactate monsters, giant sperm monsters, etc. Things do vary a bit--there are monsters based on high school cliques and even one duo of ghosts that mimic the relationship between a prostitute and her pimp, but by and large the show aims for nonstop gross-out.\\n\\n\r\nWhen there's not action on the screen, we mostly follow the lives of Panty and Stocking, who begin the show as being very unlikable, and end it as being only marginally more likable. Panty is a sex-obsessed blonde, convinced of her superior beauty--she wields the power to turn undergarments into firearms. (As you can imagine, this leads to some pretty interesting 'transformation' sequences.) Stocking is a lolita-goth girl whose love for sweets may even exceed Panty's love for sex. She can turn stockings into swords. The two lack any other noteworthy talents, other than being exceptionally adept at hurling insults at one another. There are other characters as well, the two most important being Garterbelt, who acts as their guide and mentor, and Brief--a regular guy who falls hopelessly in love with Panty.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are bound and determined to watch this, allow me to suggest that you do so with the English dub on. Who would have guessed it, but the Japanese were even more limited in their vulgarity than the English dubbing crew was--the director himself prefers the inventive vulgarity of the English script. (That said, the Japanese version does have its charms, and is well worth watching, as well.) Things do get off to a bit of a rough start in the early proceedings, but about halfway through a surprisingly decent sense of continuity is established, and it does honestly build to a hell of a concluding chapter. Let me just say that this anime ends with the Gainax ending to end all Gainax endings--stick around after the credits have rolled and be prepared for the most ridiculous, over-the-top, shocking stinger of all time. I genuinely hope this show gets a second season. It needs one.\\n\\n\r\nDoes this show have any redeeming values? Mmmm. Depends. It is vulgar and juvenile yes, but the action sequences are frequently jaw-dropping, and, believe it or not, there are a couple moments that actually generate real pathos or sweetness. PSG is more than just caffeine-fueled sex-obsessed juvenile wanking--it's got a heart in there somewhere. (Buried very, very, very, very, very deeply.) And some of the tributes it pays to various other films and anime are genuinely very well done. All that aside--you're not going to enjoy this unless you've got a strong stomach and an open mind. I hate to admit it, but I found myself enjoying it quite a lot, especially as it moved past the half-way point. And a couple of the experimental episodes (particularly one that takes place entirely in a single room with only one static background) are pretty exceptional--they work way better than they have any right to. All told, it's sort of a wonder to behold.",

Only because of this anime's unique and amazing(some say orgasmic) qualities I am even bothering to create this review.\r\n Never have I seen anything this strange become something this amazing. It's like the ugly food that you never wanted to try, but once you've tried it you taste the sweet nectar of its sheer brilliance.\r\nNow please enjoy.\r\nStory:\r\nStory is its weakest point, and that is a compliment. This anime isn't meant for the story yet the episodes keep you interested. You don't watch this anime to understand the twisted plotline. You watch it to enjoy theroller coaster ride that is the twisted plotline. The laughs, the sexual jokes and ecchi, the action! There is so much well played mindless comedy its amazing. The ecchi is a lot more comedic than it usually is. It just works!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is about two fallen angels, Panty and Stocking. To get back to heaven they must collect enough heaven coins. Now there's also the big mean bad boss and arch rivals and such. But you'll see that for yourself, i'm not gonna go into detail about that.They aqcuire these by killing ghosts.Guess what they use to kill the ghosts? Their panty and stockings! Wierd, i know.  Now here's your basic episode. \\n\\n\r\nGhost appears--->ghost is killed.\\n\\n\r\ndoesn't seem to interesting does it? But you know what? Its gold, they make it work. The stuff that happens in between. The ride of that arrow between \"appears\" and \"ghost\" is one of the most enjoyable comedies I have EVER watched. I laughed every episode many times. I don't think i've laughed that much since school rumble.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole thing is a \"wtf\" show, and it works! \\n\\n\r\nOnly thing i didn't like was the ending, but hey when you watch it you'll understand. I'm not gonna spoil. If you do watch it and finish it please message me with your reaction. I flipped!!!\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very very western. Aside from a few scenes its like a lot of western cartoons. Remember power puff girls? Dexters lab? The art is A LOT like that. It's not bad at all! They make it work. And there are some very well made sequences that don't like like western cartoons, I would like to note that KEY supervised the animation. Yes those people who made the amazing clannad, angel beats, and so forth. You can tell which part they really helped in!! \\n\\n\r\nSound:.\\n\\n\r\nMY favourite part of the show. Amazing amazing amazing. You don't even understand. You probably won't be able to appreciate how the sound and ESPECIALLY the music makes this show exponentially better. The music is amazing, (the OP is kinda Meh). Not just the ED or OP, but the background music is amazing. You don't even notice it and you find yourself humming the tune or hearing it your head! I had to download so much music because of this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI love the characters, theres very few shows where i don;t hate any characters and this is one of them. They all serve their purposes and are very very funny. You know that feeling when you want a character off the freaking screen? Ya, you won't get  that here.\\n\\n\r\nNow i could tell you what the characters are like, or you can go look at the character pages yourself. lol\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is so unique. It combines american styles with anime styles. It makes a near perfect hybrid. I actually didn't want to watch this, but I'm glad i did. Remember that food analogy i made up there? think about it. Don't judge a book by its cover.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode was not too amazing, watch 2 or 3 eps. If you don't like it then. You won't like it at all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow go forth, watch this anime, love the ride, maybe hate the ending idk. You'll have to see for yourself. And don't forget, tell em your reaction for the ending. I would love to hear it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Supposedly, Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt was created when the staff of Gurren Lagann got drunk together and ranted about how they wanted to try something different. (At least that's what I gathered from looking up information about it). The result is a series with the theme being \"vulgar and indecent\" jokes inspired by American adult animation. How does it fare? Let's take a look at Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. \r\nThis is another comedy without a major overarching story. Rather, it's very episodic with most of the episodes having nothing to do with each other except for using the same characters and humour. Thesetting is that two angels are on earth, fighting supernatural monsters called ghosts to earn heaven coins so that they can return home. Moving on to the important question, is it funny? Well, the humour is based largely on bodily fluids, pop culture references, and sex. It's pretty juvenile for being targeted toward adults. It kind of reminds me of a cross between Conker's Bad Fur Day and Ren & Stimpy. It's fine for what it is, but it certainly isn't intelligent humour.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty one-dimensional tropes. The main protagonists have personalities that revolve mostly around their vices (sweets and sex). The supporting characters generally get a few personality traits and that's it. None of the characters get developed or fleshed out over the course of the anime either. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is mostly exaggerated and reminiscent of a children's cartoon. The few moments where they use a more traditional anime form are used exclusively for fan-service. I'm not necessarily against their usual art, even if it does come across as pretty lazy, but why couldn't they at least be consistent? Do we really need a bunch of fan-service moments? Did they just figure that if the show's theme was designed for extremely immature young men they might as well give them something to ogle? It's this sort of thing that makes me hate being lumped together with other members of my demographic. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting tends toward exaggeration. Although not as much as you might think. One other issue is that the random Engrish seems out of place. It's almost like they just wanted to throw random expletives in because expletives are somehow funny? Other than that, the voice acting isn't the strongest I've ever heard, but it's fine. The music varies from bad techno to actually well sung music with a good beat. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 2/10. The demon sisters have one short incest scene but there's nothing aside from that.\\n\\n\r\nIs Panty and Stocking good? Well, if you like that sort of crude humour you'll probably enjoy it. As for me, I have to give it a 3/10. I outgrew laughing at body fluids and considering sex funny a long time ago. As such, the jokes come off as crass and generally pretty stupid but it's a mostly harmless type of stupidity.",

I don't believe that it will become anymore complex than this as it's only going to be 13 episodes long, but it's a decent concept and I wouldn't expect no surprises from this studio.\r\nThe art is unique. It might be a turn down and it might be something refreshing. I think it's actually very nice and finally something new.  It might not be your taste. At first Ihad the same feelings about it and I never expected myself to watch it when I saw it in the fall anime list. I'm sure happy that I did.

Unique like the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a bit... over the top stereotypical. You have a blond slut and a sugar loving goth.

            "content": "Basically, I tried watching this show when it came out. And I absolutely hated it. But after tossing and turning the thought around, I finally decided to re-watch it, and I absolutely loved it.\r\nI do NOT suggest watching this show if you are easily annoyed by excessive sexual references, profanity, and if you take every little thing too seriously. Also if you're those types of people who like to nitpick at anime which is...\r\nBUT I DIGRESS.\r\nSTORY:\r\nBasically it takes place is Daten City, a place between Heaven and Hell, and you've got Panty and Stocking who are two angels who kill ghosts to collect Heaven Coinsto get back to Heaven. Although this show has completely randomness in every single episode that usually don't follow one another, the entire plot still shines through the whole time (i.e collecting Heaven Coins to get to Heaven) and although most episodes are WTF crazy they still make...as much sense as this series possibly can make (overall you won't feel confused after the end of an episode or during the middle).\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe artwork...is breathtaking. Now I know it's drawn in a huge cartoony (reminds me of PPG) kinda way, there are scenes where it breaks away from that and it's absolutely lovely. The animation is also flawless.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nSound is amazing. Don't even get me started on the soundtrack. I think the soundtrack just makes the series all the more better. And it's all so addicting...\\n\r\nI still get numerous songs stuck in my head throughout the day. Watch the series and you'll see what I mean (I'm actually listening to it right now).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nYou've got Panty Anarchy who is a bitch whore angel. Her panties turn into a gun named Back Lace (or Black Lace..? Black Lace just seems better to me haha). Her favorite thing in the universe is f*cking which is extremely apparent in the first episode. I used to find Panty's character to be very annoying, but needless to say she grew on me. The show would not be the same without her.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's her sister Stocking Anarchy whose stockings turn into Katanas (Stripe I & II). She's a goth bitch who'd rather acquire the worst case of diabetes than do anything else. Stocking is kinda my favorite character so I can't say much without being biased...haha\\n\r\nOh and did I mention that she's into bondage?\\n\\n\r\nThey live with Garterbelt, a big black afropriest who happens to love little boys. That's another thing with this show: EXPECT. STEREOTYPES. But keep in mind they're only poking fun at said stereotypes.\\n\r\nThey also have this....dog thing...who very much resembles Gir. His name is Chuck, and thats usually all he does is run around yapping his name, but I wasn't at all bothered by this.\\n\r\nThey drive a Jeep named See Through. This Jeep has no personality whatsoever so there isn't much to say. EXCEPT IT'S A PINK JEEP OKAY.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Brief who...is a nerdy otaku obsessed with Panty and is a complete pusscake. But hey, it's okay.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there are the Demon Sisters, Scanty and Kneesocks. They're proper demons who believe highly in rules and often talk down to Panty and Stocking for being improper whores; not that they really give a shit. They become Panty and Stockings enemies for obvious reasons.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think the characters are great. None of them really seem to be plot devices which is always nice. All of them add their own spice to the show and make it what it is.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALLLLLLLLLLLL:\\n\r\nThis show is great especially if you love whores, angels on dance polls, amazing electronic music, chocolate, and bitches. And, well, I happen to love all of those things a lot.\\n\r\nBut in all seriousness, if you like goofy shows with ecchi, amazing characters, amazing art/animation style, and amazing music definitely try to sit past the first few episodes. But as I said earlier, try not to take it too seriously! If you do it WILL ruin the show for you.",

            "content": "In Japan animation is a diverse storytelling medium, but in the West it's a different story. While there are some exceptions, there are pretty much two types of shows Westerners are comfortable seeing animated: children's shows and unrestrained adult comedies. Panty & Stocking is essentially both mashed into one. Just from looking at its character designs you might not even realize it was made in Japan, they're nearer those Saturday morning cartoons we all grew up on. As a further similarity, most of the episodes are broken into two vignettes like an American cartoon. Unlike those cartoons we grew up on, though, this show isfilled to the brim with profanity, sex jokes and toilet humor. A show like this could only have come from the creative minds of studio Gainax.\\n\\n\r\nWith a couple of exceptions, Gainax as an artistic group has historically been best-suited to more cartoonish and exaggerated art styles. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that they're right at home and having a big party. The character models are stubby and wide-eyed, in keeping with the \"Saturday morning cartoon\" style I mentioned earlier. The show defaults to a soft-lined, bright pastel-shaded aesthetic, but its repertoire is far from limited to that. Like FLCL, another noteworthy Gainax series, Panty & Stocking is an animator's playground--it doesn't stand out so much for its high budget (though it does have good production values) as its wide variety of memorable styles and techniques, paying homage to several other works on both sides of the Pacific. With only a few slip-ups this show looks consistently good-to-great, artful even. Ghost designs range from atrocious to repugnant, but that's the point. This series knows how to show its audience something gross, and conversely its eye candy dazzles just as effectively. Episode 6 and the finale in particular pull out all the stops.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is even better. I'm not really a fan of electronic or hip-hop music, but I can appreciate that it's a well-made score. Pretty much every piece sounds great on its own, but it was written for the show and fits it seamlessly, ranging from lighthearted piano to seductive jazz to the bouncing notes of curiosity to the high-energy leitmotifs that punctuate all the major battles. Of particular note is the series' signature piece \"Fly Away\" (that's a Japanese euphemism for jizz, fun fact) which plays during Panty and Stocking's transformation sequences. It probably wouldn't sound out-of-place coming from a local strip club, and this is the only show I can think of where that's actually a compliment. To the musically inclined, I'd recommend giving the soundtrack a listen even if you have no interest in the show itself. Also, the ending theme is equal parts adorable and disquieting.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as voice acting goes, I'm inclined to recommend the dub over the sub, but the reason for this is a cultural one that has little to do with actual performance quality. Japanese is traditionally thought of as a softer, more understated language than English, but the seiyuu cast does its darnedest to prove that notion wrong. It's an enthusiastic, appropriately raunchy and over-the-top performance that definitely did the show's tone justice. Still, crude and crass dialog only has so much punch in a language you don't speak, and that's where the dub comes in. It couples equally bombastic and cartoony performances with an adaptive script that colors the dialog with more f-bombs than the now-legendary Black Lagoon dub, I am not hyperbolizing. Profanity is no substitute for wit, of course, but all of the lines are modern and in-character, and they fit the show's overall tone. Just as importantly, it's clear that the folks at Funimation had a blast dubbing this show.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've gotten the show's technical pedigree out of the way, let's set them aside and look at the story on its own merits. At the very least it's a pretty unique concept, the fusion of children's cartoon and adult cartoon tropes is different enough to make this show stand out, but it still leaves the question of what the selling point is. Raunchy comedy being what it is, the humor here is fairly predictable. The characters are flat and the jokes are in-your face rather than subtle, so most of the humor comes purely from catching its audience off-guard. I understand why some people get immature giggles out of this, and I'll admit it even got me a couple of times, but for the most part that brand of comedy doesn't impress me. As I mentioned above, profanity and offensive content aren't a substitute for genuine humor, and I've already established in my Pani Poni Dash! review that weak hit-or-miss comedy isn't enough to warrant a recommendation from me. There are some genuinely clever moments, such as Panty being unable to remove her Panties because she's wearing shorts, but these moments are few and far.\\n\\n\r\nI know that many people will find this show repulsive and I don't blame them. For those readers who are still blissfully unaware, the ghosts Panty and Stocking fight include a gigantic turd that haunts toilets, an enormous woman who produces super-fattening milk, and a penis the size of a skyscraper, I am not making this up. Those are probably the worst of the bunch, but the rest of the show is far from tame in that regard. There is simply no way to make this series sound dignified, not with that kind of content. If hygiene is important to you, stay away from this show at all costs. At the opposite end of the spectrum, this show is peculiar in that it dabbles into just about every fetish imaginable and yet outside of a few glamour shots Panty & Stocking is never really \"sexy\". On one hand it's refreshing that it doesn't go for cheap exploitation, but on the other, if you're going to cram this much suggestive subject matter into thirteen episodes, I can't help but feel that the least you could do is make it appealing. Just a thought.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing behind this series is far from impressive either. I'm not talking about the disjointed storytelling, that's perfectly forgivable given the episode structure, and leaving a vignette with a problem unresolved (such as a zombie horde or their dog-like pet Chuck losing his brain) is also something I'm willing to let slide--again, this series pays tribute to Western cartoons. I'm talking about the underlying arc they create. Yes, they really do try to weave all the story elements (at least, starting around episode 6) into a coherent plot, tying together the Daemon sisters Scanty and Kneesocks, Panty's hopeless suitor Brief, and Garterbelt's mysterious past. This series may be aimed at an adult audience content-wise, but much like its predecessor Gurren Lagann the plot is, to put it bluntly, stupid. One episode Panty and Stocking will be fighting a ghost in public and regarded as superheroes, the next they'll go \"undercover\" as high school students. Why, when Scanty and Kneesocks are introduced as \"the mayor's daughters\", do they never investigate said mayor? I assure you that's just the tip of the iceberg.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the numerous issues I have with this series, however, there are two reasons I can't bring myself to write it off completely. My first reason comes back to the show's artistry and production values, and I think that's where most of this show's appeal (if you could call it that) comes from. On one level it's nostalgic, hearkening back to those 90's Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon and Warner Brothers shows many viewers grew up on; even if this show fails at wit, I think there's still some merit to its cartoony slapstick comedy. The characters, conflicts and fights are simple, but the presentation is striking and the battles, at their best, are high-energy and genuinely fun. At the same time, this series isn't completely derivative either; there's one segment animated in a style reminiscent of the likes of Tekkonkinkreet, focusing on a typical Japanese salaryman trying to make it through his day job and still be a hero on his daughter's birthday. Another half-episode is shot entirely from a single camera angle, and there are quite a few other moments in the series that stand out in their own rights purely for the creativity poured into them.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, what really struck me about this show is that no matter how crass and stupid it got, it still felt genuine. The writing may be a muddled mess, but when all was said and done I never saw Panty not being Panty or Stocking not being Stocking. The jokes in this series might not be my cup of tea, but Panty & Stocking doesn't care. Getting back to Gainax as a creative studio, I think that the spirit in which this series was made is one they need to adopt more often. It's not trying too hard to impress its audience with wit or subtlety, it's just having a good old time, and anyone who wants to join is welcome. If nothing else, Panty & Stocking is a labor of love. The coda at the end of the show basically takes the entire plot, throws it into a blender and hits the switch without covering the lid. I'm pretty sure someone at Gainax stood up and said \"hey, wouldn't this be a cool idea for a sequel?\" and they threw it in at the end without a second thought. I feel like this should piss me off to no end, but I can't muster any rage against it. It was a stupid and immature ending, but that fits the show perfectly. If they ever turned that idea into a second season, I'd probably watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Panty & Stocking was made for a very specific audience, and it definitely won't work for a lot of people. If the premise repulses you to your very core, the execution will do nothing to change your mind. Still, if anything about this show piques your interest I'll tip the scale in its favor. For those who're doubtful, I'd recommend watching episode 6 to gauge your reaction, and unless you really love what you see you can ignore everything that came before (except the latter half of episode 5, which is actually pretty good). It's a stupid and pointless show, but unforgettable execution and sincerity are enough to earn a passing grade from me.",

            "content": "Anime has had a really strong influence in western animation in at least the last decade. Many cartoons have adopted the art style, direction and humour from classic anime to present their story; that's why many people worship the importance of anime in pop culture. That being said, is weird seeing anime taking inspiration from cartoons; it just not something that appeals to  the common anime demographic, especially because these always turn out to be an interpretation of the western culture instead of a way to accentuate or elevate the concept as a whole.\r\nThis however, cannot be applied to Panty and Stocking With Garterbelt.Even the name has this ridiculous double entendre that pretty much describes the zaniness and quirckiness of the show. \\n\\n\r\nPanty and Strocking follows the two titular characters, a pair of angels with a racy behaviour that are buying there way back to heaven being guided by Garterbelt, an over the top priest. They all locate this creatures known as ghosts to cleanse Earth from evil. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself takes the structure of a normal cartoon, with one episode having two different segments each one with a different plot. This works for the advantage of the show, because it allows for more self contained stories that can be put in their own different canon; allowing for really creative stories along its run. The problem with these structure is that almost all of the development is taken away from the characters, the last moments of the show being the exception. This is a huge misunderstanding of cartoons, because even the ones made for kids use development to the strenght of the plots. All in all, the story isn't the most attractive thing in the world but it's execution through the offensive yet playful dialogue is masterfully done, the banter between the characters and the way they interact with each other is both clever and funny on its own. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the writing can be quite funny at times, it can also stumble in some pretty clich\u00e9 ideas overused in 90 percent of cartoons. It can also be, to put it plainly, quite disguting at times; using farts, vomit and other shit like that as focal points for an episode. Other major flaw of the show, is the lack of interest it presents on turning its two main characters into something likeable, it's pretty common feeling as if the show was trying to make you hate the pair because of their horrible behaviour towards the poeple around them which can get annoying in some parts of the show where the issues they're dealing could be solved easily if they weren't complete assholes, trait that is emphisized by the limited traits the pair has.\\n\\n\r\nStrangely enough, that doesn't stop the show of being really entertaining. Besides the quirky dialogue, the show packs a really stylized art that's oozing with some style(see the main characters for further proof). Every frame in the show comes to life using some visual onomatopeia and using an attractive combination of colours. This is accentuated, or ruined depending on how you see it,  with a smooth change of art styles throughout the episodes or segments (with varying levels of quality), which can make the art feel a bit inconsitent. The only department where the art can be guilty of being poor is during some of the animation sequences that look either rushed or unfinished. \\n\\n\r\nWhen the art department and the animation sync in the right way, the show can be a blast to watch and it gives the audience the show's most memorable sequences, each accompanied by an ost inspired by Jpop that, while it's limited, it's quite delightful in it's own right. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, when the pieces are working well together the show can be an exciting and really entertaing show just to watch but due to technical limitations caused by a really apparent low budget, some poor writing decisions and characterization. That being said, if you want an anime with a unique style and an accelerated pace, and can handle racy or flat out gross writing or imagery; you'll probably enjoy Panty And Stocking With Garterbelt. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Panty and Stocking... what do I say? There's certainly no string of profanities I could use to describe it that aren't used in the show (not that I would anyway, for I quite enjoyed it). If one couldn't tell, this show, despite how it appears on the outside, is NOT for children. A relentlessly crass and profane show, but at the same time absolutely funny. I call it Powerpuff Girls mixed with South Park with a healthy dose of Gainax.\r\nStory: 6\r\nEpisodic, which is not all bad for a 13 episode series. Each episode is split into two short 12 minute segments, a la Powderpuff Girls/Dexter'sLaboratory. They're mostly non-sequential, so watching all but the last few out of order makes little difference to the plot. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nAgain, I really liked the art in this show. It's refreshing to see a show animated in a different form from what one typically expects from Japanese animation. It's colorful, explosive, and in your face.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack to this show is phenomenal. A groovy blend of synth/dance pop, electro house, rock, and  infectious hooks will have you dancing despite the insanity happening onscreen. (actually bought the OST for this one.)\\n\r\nI feel like the dub/sub argument should be made here, as well. D-U-B all the way on this one. The original Japanese audio is fine, but the English really takes it to the next level. The way the VA's play off each other and their chemistry in English is top notch, and the jokes are taken to the next level.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nYou've got two salacious sisters, the degenerate angels Panty and Stocking Anarchy. They have their vices, sex and sweets respectively, and these are exploited throughout the series to the fullest extent, even becoming themes for particular episodes. Their foil, Garterbelt, is a felonious priest charged with  trying to control the two angels and get them to clean up the monsters plaguing the city, to _some_ avail.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThe humor is sophomoric, the visuals brought me back to my childhood watching the old Cartoon Network classics, and the music kept me bobbing my head the entire time. I laughed, I was grossed out, and even I shouted \"WTF\" at the screen a couple of times. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 ( would give an 8, but some of it just falls a bit flat)\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the art in this one. I read that some of the crew at Gainax got drunk one night and watched some American cartoons and decided to base the look of this show off of them (Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Lab influences very obvious). The childish/western looking animation with the very adult humor and language made a good dynamic that served to make the show even funnier. The gross outs and gags that are typically pulled in such children's cartoons were turned up to 11, stood on their head, and kicked into the next dimension.",

            "content": "Panty and Stocking is the perfect example of something I didn\u2019t know I wanted until I watched it. Watching a pair of foul-mouthed sisters \u2013 one an oversexed blonde and the other a sugar-addict goth - use garments as weapons to defeat an array of perverse ghosts may sound like something a kid comes up with for a laugh. Don\u2019t be fooled. Gainax have used a crazy combination of thick-line art, wacky animation plus some genuinely funny humour to deliver this premise in style and do so while making a fun nod to many western films and TV series. While some P&S episodes are noticeableweaker than others, this crass, deranged piece of madness builds to a bizarre and awesome climax. The longer and harder you get invested into it the more the excitement builds until you can\u2019t contain it anymore. Is my share of obligatory puns now accounted for? Excellent, let\u2019s press on. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a tale of two angels, the Anarchy sisters, looking to fight their way back to heaven by killing ghosts. Panty is a sex-addict with a low tolerance for work that doesn\u2019t take place in bed while her sister Stocking would rather put pastries before people. With the assistance of the priest Garterbelt they try to earn their coins to buy their way back to heaven, but the path there is one filled with demons and ghosts that have a strange list of fetishes to overcome.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s little background for the leading pair. You\u2019re strapped in and taken on a ride from minute one. It doesn\u2019t matter though that there\u2019s little substance behind the lead women. Panty & Stocking as a show only ever strives to be entertainment with a pinch of absurdity. There\u2019s nothing ground breaking to see here in the story but who really cares? It\u2019s not what you\u2019re in it for. A lot of the fun in the anime doesn\u2019t come from originality in its plot structure but its ability to combine offensiveness and adventure into something unique. Action comes thick and fast plus certain scenes and dialogue draw plenty of inspiration from famous film scenes. It\u2019s the closest experience you can get to watching a \u2018Western\u2019 anime. Its brand of crass humour usually works in its favour but there is the odd episode or scene where it started to not necessarily go too far, but rather trade too much substance for silliness.\\n\\n\r\nWith an episodic formula that worked well enough, it wasn\u2019t like the show needed a main antagonist to maintain my interest. There was enough entertainment stemming from the bizarre enemies featured each episode to keep me content. However when the show did deliver an opposing force for our lead duo it not only kicked the show up another gear but it provided a hilarious contrast for our \u2018angels\u2019. Normally the polite and well-spoken characters are who we should cheer for but the vulgar methods and dialogue of both Panty and Stocking keep you in their corner. It\u2019s a cast full of energy, taking a standard hero against villain formula and manage to keep it feeling fresh. This is a show where the protagonists don\u2019t give a damn. It bucks the trend of what heroes should be like. The two fight only for themselves, not for the benefit of humanity. They couldn\u2019t care less about what gets damaged on their road to completing a mission. This is an anime of reckless abandon both in writing and in animation. Have no fear because the writers don\u2019t push things so far so that Panty & Stocking become unlikeable. There\u2019s always this weird charm to their carefree attitude, and yes, that even includes beating someone over the head with a dildo. Panty & Stocking eventually build a great rapport where each provides something to the team the other cannot. Stocking\u2019s level-headedness makes up for Panty\u2019s habit of acting without forethought, but Panty\u2019s ability to take control and get creative assists the (slightly) quieter Stocking. \\n\\n\r\nI personally preferred the action-oriented episodes which were able to do a splendid job at showing the capabilities of Gainax. The studio have over the years proven themselves kings of using exaggerated movements and expressions to bring out humour. Opting for the thick-line animation prevalent in Western animation seems like match made in heaven with the brains at the studio. Car chases, objects crashing all over the scene and fists flying all over the place are a joy to watch. Some scenes are jaw dropping with how well they\u2019re directed and how much action they can fit into one frame. Splashes of text all over the screen to represent onomatopoeia are another addition that add to the western influence, they\u2019re great and never once looked out of place. The stylised look in character and environment give Gainax plenty of room to get creative and they use the canvas well.\\n\\n\r\nI began the show watched the subtitled version before trying out the dub and boy does the English improve the experience. Jamie Marchi (Panty) and Monica Rial (Stocking) do such a great job it\u2019s one of those times you can\u2019t imagine a more perfect voice to suit each character\u2019s design and personality. The soundtrack is also excellent, a collection of catchy pop and thumping electro tunes which add to the energy already present in the animation.\\n\\n\r\nPanty & Stocking isn\u2019t for everyone and it\u2019s definitely one of those shows that if someone told me \u201cthat was garbage\u201d I\u2019d politely nod and think \u201cThat\u2019s fair enough\u201d. It\u2019s a brand of humour I\u2019d tell someone that I\u2019d grown out of as I puff my chest out in pride. P&S stocking pulled my mind back into the gutter and pressed my face into the filth that lied there. And I liked it. \\n\\n\r\nRepent, motherfucker!",

            "content": "Panty and stocking hmm... if your in to messed up,funny and diabolic anime, i definetly recommend you with this +*%#. I just discovered this anime show recently, by searching up anime blurays in amazon; i saw a cartoon animated bluray that has a age rating of 18+. WTF why would a cartoon animated anime be 18+. I had to accept reality when i realised that when i started to watch it. This anime has so much sex jokes, that it will blow your mind (mainly about d%$ks) WELL WHAT DO YOU ESPECT! ITS FREAKIN 18+ AND BASED IN AMERICA! Dont be mistaken by the coverin to thinking it is a child freindly cartoon, somes scenes are like watching a hentai-ish stuff. (WITHOUT THE DAMN NUDITY) In other words, this anime is like a hentai, but without nudity... wat dat does not even make sense?\\n\\n\r\nStory 10\\n\r\nI found the story to be incredibly unique and not cliche. Its set in a fucked up city called daten city where fucked up stuff occur. One day two fucked up angels (actually one) called Panty and Stocking come down to the city as a punishment of not behaving in the heavens. Their task is to kill ghosts in the city and collect heavens to return back to the heavens aswell as protect daten city from this fucked ghosts. With their supervisor Garterbelt a lot of chaos and action occur in this anime. To be honnest there a main plot skimmed in and out the episodes, but majority of the anime consists of them killing the ghosts and sex jokes... yup sex jokes.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation 10\\n\r\nThe reason that i score the art a 10 is, because its different to normal anime that uses the manga art style. Its not normal that studios create anime with cartoon american art. So yep im being biased here, because in reality the art is okay, but because its an anime work i rate it 10.\\n\r\nAswell as there were some unique live action shots used when panty and stocking killed a ghost. However there was a fucked up live action emerge with the animation towards the end of the last episode that did put the WTF factor over the roof.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\r\nI have to admit that the opening/endings and soundtrack are AWESOME!! Composed mainly by Teddyloid comes DJ soundtrack with a good rhythm. Insert songs are sung in english and with a fucked and good tone. *She sings Fly away now* FLY AWAY NOW!!!!!!!!!. Another good insert song that matched the theme was \"D city rock\". It matched with the belverly hills atmosphere. The ending theme \"fallen angel\" was reminiscent of Guilty crown \"release my soul\" to me, because the same artist sang the song. Strange to me, i was shocked to find that out. Well i posted some trivia.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8\\n\r\nEvery single character is lovable in this anime (even the demon sisters), there were astonishing character designs such as Garterbelt and Panty- well every character designs in the anime fitted perfectly for their role. The negatives were that the character relationship was rushed, especially between Breif and Panty. Their relationship pissed me of, because Panty fucks alot of men during the show and SPOILER, SPOILER...\\n\r\nThe characters personalties were one of a kind. \\n\\n\r\nPanty is an angel who likes sex and fucking men. This has no shame at all. Shes 100% shameless. \\n\r\nStocking is a goth who like sweet,delicious and mouth watering snacks and are in to trampy men.\\n\r\nGarterbelt is a black preist with a sad past and is quite muscular.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement 8\\n\r\nThrough out the anime i enjoyed a vast majority of episodes, that were funny, until a episode arrived with basically Panty and Stocking watching TV and the pet (i dont know his name) get raped and abused to death, by the devils pet...\\n\r\nYep that episodes wasted 21 mins of life that i cant get back, aswell as there were awkward sex jokes. Very awkward if you watch with some one else.However the action,sound and characters combined made this anime very enjoyable thus fucked up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7\\n\r\n100% matched for the seinen demographic (older men) due to the overdose of sex jokes and sex humour, however any other audience will enjoy this if they are mature enough to watch this hillarious and teardropping anime. Definetly worth watching for a laugh and not for serious audiences, because there wasn't great plot development. Its just another comedy anime to pass the time.\\n\\n\r\nPositives\\n\r\n.Unique character design and animation\\n\r\n.Dj based soundtrack and awesome insert songs\\n\r\n.Epic opening\\n\r\n.Very vivid\\n\r\n.Awesome live action-ish scenes\\n\r\n.Different storyline to usual anime\\n\r\n.Loads of WTF factor (is this even a positive)\\n\\n\r\nNegatives\\n\r\n.Below average plot development\\n\r\n.Character realationships pissed me off\\n\r\n.Character development occurs at later episodes\\n\r\n.Some filler episodes\\n\r\n.Cliche's of sex jokes through out the series, that make it awkward to watch\\n\r\n.SHITTY ENDING ...\\n\r\nwell wat did me expect, studio Gainax did create this anime *cough,cough and cough* \\n\r\n(Also from the same studio creaters of Neon Genesis Evangellion and FLCL)\\n\r\n.Fucked up live action scene towards end of last episode\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review, plus there may be grammer mistakes; sorry if there is ever any.\\n\\n",

            "content": "English Version.\r\nPut in a blender toilet jokes, protagonists whores and references to American franchises and gives you this fucked up\r\nHistory (2/10):\r\nThe series has absolutely nothing less than the starring Panty and Stocking, the entire stories of the series are one of two: 1) Parody to an American franchise. 2) P & S day stories making only sex jokes ... That's basically the whole series; The worst of the case is that the series instead of just \"reference\" finish, the entire frames of the chapters, the episodes have no difference, the original stories are only inserting a panty and stocking in it; When the series aspiredto something better was when the demon sisters showed up making them look like some interesting antagonists but were relegated to a rocket team more.\\n\\n\r\nThe red humor of the series is horrible, it does not laugh unless it is a teenager who laughs with things like \"Shit, sex, sex, pee, shit, vomit, semen\" all his comedy stagnates in the first episode since they repeat the same routine of the joke throughout the series and never make it as fresh as in Ebichu\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2/10)\\n\r\nAll are also a piece of shit, Panty the only thing she does in the series is to be a whore and the series loves to repeat it over and over again in the face that she is a whore, Stocking is boring, Garterbell is even more forgettable if it were not Due to the fact that he is black, gay and masochistic, Chuck is tolerable between such a obnoxious cast, the diablas are the best of the series but it is potentially wasted and they are only longer in the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nCreative and quite striking. What attracts of the series is its style of American cartoons turning it the style remaining identifiable and the best thing is periods of transformation when P & S change of cartoons to an animated style (SEXY); The series plays quite a lot with many styles of animation from the end when they kill their enemies by turning everything back to the mache paper mock up to 3D scenes, achieving less than the Imaishi direction in the series is the same as their other works based on more the dynamism and the camera movements at atmospheric level turning in periscope to better appreciate the scene\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10).\\n\r\nThe best of the series from afar, is music that can be used in a club and would be excellent, the soundtrack is a combination of sex with electro that while most of the film is innocent, the instrumental accompaniment with eccentric and moved rhythms. Easy becomes one of your favorite OST\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10).\\n\r\nI finished it by obligation waiting for something good and ended up with something horrible, I will only keep the memory of that excellent soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10).\\n\r\nI do not give the 2 for the soundtrack and the animation for more than the whole series is bad, that two factors can keep you hooked to look at it\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nVersion en Espa\u00f1ol\\n\\n\r\nMete en una licuadora chistes de inodoro, protagonistas putas y referencias a franquicias estadounidenses y te da de resultado este bodrio\\n\\n\r\nHistory (2/10):\\n\r\nLa serie no tiene absolutamente nada original excepto que lo protagonizan Panty and Stocking, las historias enteras de la serie son una de dos: 1) Parodia a una franquicia americana. 2) Historias del dia a dia de P&S haciendo \u00fanicamente chistes de sexo\u2026 Eso es b\u00e1sicamente la serie entera; Lo peor del caso es que la serie en vez de \u00fanicamente \u201creferenciar\u201d  termina robando, las tramas enteras de los cap\u00edtulos parodiados no tienen nada de diferencia a las historias originales solo insertando a panty and stocking en ella; Cuando la serie aspiro a algo mejor fue cuando presento a las hermanas demonios haci\u00e9ndolas ver como unas interesantes antagonistas pero fueron relegadas a un team rocket mas.\\n\\n\r\nEl humor rojo de la serie es horrible, no da risa a menos que sea un prepuberto que se rie con cosas como \u201cMierda, sexo, sexo, pipi, popo, vomito, semen\u201d toda su comedia se estanca en el primer episodio ya que repiten por toda la serie la misma rutina del chiste y jamas lo vuelven fresco como en Ebichu\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2/10)\\n\r\nTodos son igualmente un pedazo de mierda, Panty lo \u00fanico que hace en la serie es ser puta y le encanta a la serie repet\u00edrtelo una y otra vez en la cara de que es puta, Stocking es aburrida, Garterbell es aun mas olvidable si no fuera por el hecho de que es negro, gay y masoquista, Chuck es tolerable entre un cast tan detestable, las diablas son lo mejor de la serie pero fue tremendo potencial desperdiciado y las volvieron solo unas personajes m\u00e1s en la serie.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10).\\n\r\nCreativo y bastante llamativo. Lo que atrae de la serie es su estilo cartoon americano volvi\u00e9ndolo suyo el estilo quedando identificable y lo mejor es los lapsos de transformaci\u00f3n cuando P&S cambian de cartoon a un estilo anime (SEXY); La serie juega bastante con muchos estilos de animaci\u00f3n desde los finales cuando matan a sus enemigos volvi\u00e9ndolo todo a maqueta de papel mache hasta escenas de 3D, podr\u00eda mencionar igual que la direcci\u00f3n de Imaishi en la serie es la misma de sus otras obras bas\u00e1ndose mas en el dinamismo y movimientos de c\u00e1mara a nivel atmosf\u00e9rico girando en periscopio para apreciar mejor la escena\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10).\\n\r\nLo mejor de la serie de lejos, es m\u00fasica dance que f\u00e1cilmente puede ser usada en un antro y quedar\u00eda excelente, el soundtrack es una combinaci\u00f3n de sexo con electro que mientras la mayoria de la lirica es inocente (Fly away) lo instrumental lo acompa\u00f1a con ritmos exc\u00e9ntricos y movidos. Facil se vuelve uno de tus OST favoritos\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10).\\n\r\nLa termine por obligaci\u00f3n esperando algo bueno y termine con algo horrible, solo me quedare con el recuerdo de ese excelente soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10).\\n\r\nNo le doy el 2 por el soundtrack y la animaci\u00f3n por mas que la serie entera es mala, eso dos factores te pueden mantener engancho a mirarla\\n",

They're potentially funny (but probably not) when juxtaposed with something incongruous or unexpected, but they can't just tossed around like they're a free pass to instant comedy.

            "content": "The hype surrounding this series caused me to go in with a cheerful look of joy and hope, awaiting humor that I expected to make me be throwing my head back in laughter. I ended the series slumped in my chair with a face of dread and fatigue. \r\nStory:\r\n----------------------------------\r\nSimply put, there is barely any story to be found in Panty & Stocking. Two angels kill monsters made out of shit or vomit and bitch at each other. I just summarized the entire show, oops spoiler alert! The show is actually two different \"stories\" or 'mini episodes' in the 23 minute run time. At the startof each mini episode, a monster is introduced. Then, for the next 9 minutes, Stocking calls Panty a slut, and Panty calls Stocking a diabetic fatass. The humor has zero deviation and it gets extremely stale after the 2nd episode, because the show is absolutely saturated with these 'jokes'. The final minute of a mini episode is the monster making some dick or vagina related joke and then getting destroyed like he's made out of fresh Elmers Glue in 3 seconds. This repeats OVER and OVER again and I found myself drifting off and falling asleep 2 or 3 times an episode after episode 5. \\n\\n\r\n1/10\\n\r\n----------------------------------\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very fitting for the show. While I'm not very fond of it, I don't feel like this show could have \"worked\" with any other art style (I use the term 'worked' extremely loosely). The animation is nothing impressive, and is quite standard. However, the simple nature of the art can give the illusion that it's animated better than the run of the mill anime. As I said, it's not my cup of tea, but I have to give credit where credit is due.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\n----------------------------------\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was actually quite good. The music was very catchy and fit the up-beat nature of the show and everything that happened usually had a very fitting effect to accompany it. \\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\n----------------------------------\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOh christ. Where do I begin? Each character is a worthless blob of shit. There is zero development, and the dialogue is absolutely stagnant. Stocking eats a lot of sweets, and Panty loves to fuck, that's it. It is all the two main characters do throughout the entire show. The entire show is so fulled to the brim with sex 'jokes' and 'insults' that it feels like you're just watching a terrible stand up comedy act than an anime. The insults are almost completely irrelevant because they are all true. Panty IS a slut, Stocking SHOULD BE a diabetic fatass (But, y'know, anime). The sex jokes are all the same and just reworded and plastered back in after a few episodes. Even the most redundant \"That's what she said\" moments are taken to the extreme and treated as actual humor. The only redeeming character in the entire show is Garterbelt, simply because the voice actor in the english dub is excellent and actually managed to get a chuckle out of me, but other than that the characters are as horrible as it gets. \\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\r\n---------------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to like this show, but the double episodic nature, mind numbing 'humor', and horribly stale characters left me with an extremely foul taste in my mouth. The only thing compelling me to continue was the music and the confidence to write a complete and objective review on such a god-awful piece of media.\\n\\n\r\n2/10\\n\r\n---------------------------------\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you haven't progressed past the pre-pubescent stage in your life, I can understand the appeal of this show, but beyond that it baffles me. If you are past that stage in your life though, feel free to listen to some of the soundtrack if you want a taste of the show but don't want to gruel your way through this awful sludge of an anime.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n",

The sound track is also outstanding and helps make certain scenes much more enticing for the watcher.\r\nOverall this is one of my favourite shows as no matter that amount of times i re-watch it, it's still funny. This is probablyone of the best comedy's you can find and i recommend it to anyone (Except children) that enjoy laughing (Especially at crude and over sexualised humour).",

            "content": "Some people use the term cartoon to differentiate certain animated works from the more mature arts. If such arrangement is to be held, Panty and Stocking is a cartoon.\r\nIt deploys abusive language, violence, sexual vulgar and disgust, apparently a play on North American culture, for comedic effect. At the same time, it does not present a readable storyline, contains no conflicts, stage characters with no characters. The fun (in an alternative sense) thus comes hollow. This all is perhaps allowable, but does not raise its artistic value in my opinion.\r\nCompared to some other perhaps of-the-same-genre cartoons, for example, Family Guy and South Park, Panty andStocking is more outright with sexuality and violence, while containing less satire with depth. Not at fault at all, but not particularly interesting either.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT:\\n\\n\r\nI just saw some comparisons between Panty & Stocking and The Simpsons as a justification to the excellence of P&S,  and then some praises to the lack of story in P&S as its strength in story-telling.\\n\\n\r\nBut, really?\\n\\n\r\nSure P&S serves just right for some people as entertainment. Its defiance against mainstream culture standard is probably quite able to create some echoes too. (well, not mainstream anymore, judging from P&S's reception.)  But no story means a score of 0 on story. No character development means a score of 0 on character. A series may not have to have those. Yet lacking such depth for a story-telling art form is just like lacking intelligence in a person - nothing exemplary.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the comparison against The Simpsons. The comment claims Simpsons is purposeless and therefore the excellence of P&S, which is somehow connected, is justified.  Again, REALLY??  How innocent one has to be to dismiss the socio-political satire Simpsons pranks on? Or are sarcasm and humour ONLY supposed to be shallow and sexual nowadays?\\n\\n\r\nSome comments praise the series' energy and unserious fun. Sure. And it's very logical and sufficient to use these to exalt the series as \"masterpiece\", because there had been no comedies in Japanese anime history, absolutely no series that were upbeat and airy.\\n\\n\r\nI do not have the wish to proceed any further. It's not like P&S has never been done before. It's not like outright sexuality is a novelty. Just like smoking pot in public is not any symbol of defiance. Disgust is not for the first time used  in cartoons, nor is randomness. \\n\\n\r\nI appreciate how some people are enjoying the series, but feel straight offended by comments like \"some people who has trouble liking the series should learn to ENJOY themselves once after a while\". If you are smart enough to come up with a grammatic structure complicated as such, then you shouldn't be as idiotic as to being unable to understand that your standard of fun is insured to apply to yourself only.\\n",

            "content": "\"O pitiful shadow lost in the darkness, O evil spirit born of those drifting between heaven and earth, may the thunderous power from the garments of these holy, delicate maidens strike down upon you with great vengeance and furious anger, shattering your loathsome impurity and returning you from whence you came. Repent, you motherf**ker!\"\r\nWhen I first saw the preview for this, I instantly thought that this was going to spiral downward. People were gonna hate it, and there would be no chance that this would be any good at all. That's what I thought, at least. But then I started watching it. I don't knowif it was the profanity, the humor, the crude and sexual remarks... either way, this was actually a really good watch. The only other anime that I'd ever seen that could actually be crude and sexual with it still being funny in a mature way was Seitokai Yakuindomo. Very rarely do you find something similar in the anime world. You might find it on modern day television, but Japan has never been one to make animes like this. So without further ado, let's get this review started.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about 2 angels that are kicked out of Heaven due to their inappropriate behavior. One of them, Panty, is addicted to sex and her goal is to fool around with 1000 men. The other, Stocking, is the gothic candy eater. Together with the help of the sassy black priest Garterbelt and their... dog, Chuck, the two angels fight ghosts in order to collect enough angel coins to get back into heaven, while still taking time to do their own things. There isn't really any major plot in this series other than the last 2 episodes, but each episode is filled with action, humor and fun. It was really entertaining to watch as these foul-mouthed bitches fight their way to heaven.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first started watching, I was wondering if this was really considered an anime. The artwork was that of something in an american cartoon, but at closer glance, this is totally anime, but a totally different kind. If you watched Astro-Boy as a kid, you might think of it in terms of artwork. Back then, anime like Astro-Boy looks nothing like the anime of today's generation. Panty and Stocking is similar, only it's nice to have a change. Overall this artwork was actually fantastic! A lot of the time it has the same look as the poster you can find on this page, but once they start transforming their weapons, it goes to a sexy hot everyday anime style. As for the action scenes... awesome. They were awesome. I don't know how to describe them, they were just... awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSo. Much. Profanity. But it's hilarious. I know it's horrible to say that swearing made the entire show hilarious from start to finish, but it's honestly true. Anyways, I loved all the voice actors and actresses in Panty and Stocking. We have Jamie Marchi as Panty, Monica Rial as Stocking, Christopher Sabat as Garterbelt, and a few others that really were totally awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were awesome as well. I don't really have anything bad to say about them. They all have different personalities which made them lovable, but my overall favorite had to be Garterbelt. One of my favorite lines of his is what made me love him so much:\\n\\n\r\n\"PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE! SHUT THE F**K UP YOU BITCHES!\"\\n\\n\r\nThat made me drop to the floor, laughing my ass off. I don't think I've cried out of laughter that much since I had watched Seitokai Yakuindomo. Garterbelt was a brilliant character. As for Panty, she might be a slutty bitch, but she had that lovable side to her as well. Stocking was awesome, loved her sweet cravings, and she's pretty badass when wielding swords. Overall, a good character selection.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this entire show. There might have been one episode that was a little bit boring, but other than that, I was laughing every minute. Overall, this was an awesome show. If you enjoy the crude, sexual humor of Seitokai Yakuindomo or any other show similar to that, you'd love this.

            "content": "As you watch anime for a while, you begin to notice a distinction that some specific anime feature. That distinction is spirit, and it gives a show its personality. It's the difference between great anime and the rest. That spirit is proudly on display in Panty & Stocking, a show that is beautifully original, fearless, and witty. Plus, a show has to have a little bit of swagger when it announces a second season right after the last episode.\r\nPanty & Stocking with Garterbelt is the most recent project from Gainax director Imashi Hiroyuki, known for his previous anime Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Panty & Stockingis a show unlike any of Gainax's other projects, in fact it's unlike anyone's other projects. Panty (cv. Ogasawara Arisa) and Stocking (cv. Ise Mariya) are two \"angels\" that are charged to fight ghosts so they can earn coins and return to Heaven. Panty's weapon of choice is her panties, which magically turns into a handgun called \"Backlace\", while Stocking's stocking turns into a katana called \"Striped\". If you couldn't guess by now, the show is literally filled to the brim with sexual innuendos and crass jokes. When the first episode featured a giant poop monster that covers the town in feces and makes everyone vomit, I knew I was in for a rather unique anime experience. Panty & Stocking seemingly challenges itself to be more over the top than you could imagine. Counter-intuitively, despite the myriad indecent vulgarities the show steers away from arousal or eroticism, forgoing the moe aesthetic. Panty & Stocking makes no attempt to win viewers over with moe or cuteness, focusing instead on its content. This anime, folks, is serious business.\\n\\n\r\nThe most distinguishing and obvious feature of Panty & Stocking is the art style. Panty & Stocking looks like a 90's American cartoon and very much feels like it, too. I loved watching cartoons when I was a kid in the 90's, so the nostalgia factor must also have gotten to me as well. The bold, colorful style and exaggerated visuals take me right back to Cartoon Cartoon Friday. I would describe Panty & Stocking as The Powerpuff Girls with the grit of Ren and Stimpy and Courage the Cowardly Dog. All of this is infused with Imashi Hiroyuki's in-your-face, intense, fast paced animation style to create a unique pacing to the show.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode of Panty & Stocking is usually split up into two smaller stories, not unlike many American cartoons. While the structure of a few episodes tends to go along the line of \"heroines go about their normal lives, something happens, it's revealed that a monster is causing it, kill monster, celebrate\" they still manage to be refreshingly unique. In one episode, Stocking's love of sweets gets to her, as she starts to gain weight, quickly ballooning into a giant obese blimp the size of a house. Turns out a monster was lacing cakes and sweets with an agent that makes women fat. The visual gag of cute little Stocking becoming a giant tub entertained me greatly. Additionally, this show loves to have fun with itself -- parodies range from Transformers to 12 Angry Men.\\n\\n\r\nEven though Panty and Stocking are very unconventional roles, Ise Mariya and Ogasawara Arisa are at their best. Our heroines' voices sound spunky and full of energy, cusses and sexual epithets alike come out with exceptional enthusiasm. Overall, Panty & Stocking is extremely well voice acted. The music adds immense flavor to the show, heavily featuring electrosynth and house beats and some hip hop infusion.\\n\\n\r\nNow it's not perfect -- I do have nitpicking to do, that's my job right? Without giving anything away, I thought the ending in general was weak. Rather, it could have been better. I could feel it developing a few episodes before, but it still feels like the final two episodes just came out of nowhere. Also the last 2 minutes of the final episode was plain inane. It doesn't even make sense, but that still means there are 297 minutes of a damn good show. Gainax strikes gold again.\\n\\n\r\n(originally posted at http://kevo.dasaku.net/?p=1814 )",

And this is already one of the most unique things about PSG, our...protagonists...if we can even call them that.\\n\\n\r\nThe Angels, Panty and her sister Stockings, are everything but your typical Anime main character, they're rude, lazy, anarchistic, shameless and despite all these traits they are Angels! in comparison to a couple of this series major villains The Demon Sisters, Scanty and Kneesocks which are orderly, polite, (though a tad arrogant) and will alway's follow the Rules (or in their words the RURU!) These switchups make the characters stand out a great deal and in my case made me root for the villains a lot more then I probably should. but thats simply because Panty and Stockings can get so hateful at times. In a comedic way ofcrouse, but still, since they don't care about humanity, or saving the world. all they want is getting the coins get back to heaven and lead their sinful life.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very simple (aside from the fanservice transformation scenes) but in contrast the animation is a RIOT to watch.\\n\r\nespecially the chase or combat scene's are astonishingly dynamic and fastpaced, along with beautiful angles. But what deserves my respect the most is that for the majority of episodic villains they switch to a reallife clip where they blow up a handmade statue of the villain of that episode.\\n\r\nIt works greatly as a comedic factor and gets a lot of respect from me for the time it must take to craft all those statues.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music is incredibly addicting, And I easily have 4 memorable tracks from the ost that made it to my mp3 player. and i'm saying this while it's not even a genre I tend to favor.\\n\\n\r\nIn Overall, PSG is a crazy ride that makes use of it's tools the best way it can, It wants to be a saturday morning cartoon, but it's to dirty and rude to ever be one, and it's doesn't give a shit about it! the plot aside, this is a show you watch for the simple reason of \" oh geez, what are they going to do next! \" \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to point out one major flaw, it's the ending. I won't spoil it, but it ends on a major cliffhanger and up till this day we don't have a sequel. it's a typicial case of \"oh you want to know what happens next? THEN BUY THE MANGA! \" fuck you PSG, give me my second season!",

            "content": "*NOTE: This review will refrain from any spoilers that could effect your experience of the plot. All details mentioned pertaining to the plot will likely be addressed in the first few episodes. If you are looking for a complete surprise, however -- be warned.*\r\nNotes: I watched the English Dub in Blu-Ray format.\r\nThis show is very NSFW!\r\nOnto the REVIEW!:\r\nToday I finished a very... strange anime called Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. The synopsis explains all you need to know about the story...\r\nSTORY: ...which is fairly nonexistent. It basically serves as a reason for the show to explain its action sequences and a reason for its lazycharacters to get off their asses and do something. The story doesn't seem out of place or anything, but it is rather mediocre. *AUTHOR'S NOTE: There is actually 26 episodes of this anime because each episode contains 2 episodes, dividing the episode itself in half for two different events. Just thought it was worth mentioning.* 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nART: Basically a well-done parody of The Powerpuff Girls' art style. The animation itself is very fluid, and especially eye-catching is the transformation scenes where our protagonists take a more modern look and, uh... strip basically. But hey, this site says it's an ecchi anime for a reason. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Fantastic OST. It's a mix of electronica that fits nicely with the craziness happening on the screen, especially the track 'Fly Away', which has become one of my favorite songs as of late. Also noteworthy is the English dub, which I found fantastic and immensely enjoyable. There is TONS of profanity in this dub by the way, and for the most part the dialogue it works but it can occasionally seem forced. Also, the sex noises are incredibly loud... which I guess is OK for some of you (you know who you are ayylmao), but I am personally not a fan. 9/10!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Pretty stereotypical to be fair, but they are very funny even so. Stocking is probably the highlight character here, as she seems to be the most level-headed of the bunch while also having the best sarcastic lines in the show. I'm not going to defame the other characters in this section, but do know that they aren't as spectacular. *EDIT: -1 point to characters for show's ending.* 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: The most important category, in my opinion, but also the most subjective. I personally enjoyed this anime a lot, but this feeling swung like a pendulum from episode to episode. For example, there were very uncomfortable and somewhat disgusting episodes, for example one where there was a booger ghost made from a nose-picking therapy session, and another episode where semen was personified into military soldiers climbing a vagina hill. Yes, you read that correctly. Then there were golden episodes, like where our characters are just chilling on a couch and being themselves as a camera stays stationary in the living room the entire episode, and this episode was by far my favorite as it contrasted all the action of the other episodes very well, while also providing some of the best comedy in the series. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL/SUMMARY: This anime is not for the light-hearted OR the mature -- it is very childlike in every way, yet disturbingly dark at the same time. It takes your childhood memories of western cartoons and smashes them with the metaphorical hammer of adulthood. I would recommend this anime to anyone that is over 16 years old and that is OK with South Park-like comedy and dark themes. 6.8/10, rounded to a 7/10 overall score.\\n\\n\r\nIf you found this review helpful or not at all, feel free to rate. Until next time, peace!",

            "content": "A big bucket of WTF. Ok, I get where Gainax was going with this, and I suppose there are lots of fans of this kind of humour. But this constant bombardment of colour, chatter, explosions and random events is not my cup of fun. I tried to watch it in japanese, but the hysterical tempo made it impossible to keep track of the subtitles, so I quickly switched to the english dub. Which actually was really good. The voice acting was totally fine and the dialogue was freely translated and greatly improved upon. That, combined with the western-style art style, made me forget that thiswas actually made in Japan in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nBackground music and sound effects are top notch and fits perfectly with the bombastic animation. Opening and ending songs are a bit more bland. The art style is cool and very well executed. I love the foul language and the indecent theme. But it all is too much and it comes at you totally at random. I like poop, foul language and sex just as much as the next guy, but when it's all presented so methodically erratic, I have a hard time enjoying it to the fullest.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem I have with this show is that, although it nearly kills you with the epileptic seizure-inducing intensity that it blasts all of this at you, it still holds back when it comes to sex. The main character's name is Panty, a nymphomaniac. As anime fans, we are constantly bombarded with unmotivated panty shots, and when we finally get a show where they would actually fit in perfectly with the theme, Gainax holds back. It's not like I feel robbed of a masturbation session, it's that it feels so insincere by the creators.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all... sure, I liked it, it was pretty funny. But much of the humor was just not my thing. Too bad, the first episode really got my hopes up.",

Yet, it is one scandously enjoyable show as it parodies pop culture in a way that is entertaining and fun to watch. Additionally making very strong political statements about traditional values and censorship. \r\nStory: \r\nThis follows a very basic structure to those of magical girls genre as the story follows two angels by the name of Panty and Stocking. They collect Heaven Coins by defeating materialized evil created out of human. \r\nPersonally this somehow ties to the popular American cartoon 'Powerpuff Girls' as an episode is normallymade up of two mini stories featuring our beloved 'Protagonists' (A term I use very loosely to say the least).\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of production quality and character designs this show is top notch. The show has a very American animation whilst sometimes mixing with different animation styles that vary from graphically unpleasant to soothing eye candy. It also uses live action clips that detaches the audience and adds on the perception that what is scene on the show is merely fiction.\\n\\n\r\nThere are however faults in the show as the audience might often feel embarrassed. Episodes like the 'booger' & 'vomit' episode are notable examples of revolting imagery.",

            "content": "Flawless Victory!\r\nGetting straight to the point, coming from Studio Gainax, we were never expecting a clear-cut, easy-to-follow series.\r\nBut what we did get was glorious! Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt proves that you don't need a heavy plot or complex story-lines to make something truly special.\r\nEverything from the title of the anime to the f and c-bombed dialogue shows that this anime doesn't care who it offends. And it does. This is one of the most controversial series I've ever witnessed. The toilet jokes, profanity in every sentence, and episode themes make for a disgusting experience.\r\nThe use of puns are timed perfectly, and the pop-culture referenceskeep the whole experience current and relatable, and over-exaggeration keeps the anime upbeat and funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is gorgeous. Bold colours and little detail keeps the animation easy on the eyes, and the character design is wacky and non-serious.\\n\r\nThe characters are positively adorable, and it's so easy to feel completely immersed in the situation they are in.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the biggest draw is the audio. The soundtrack is strong on every track. The OST is a joy to the ears, and the perfect timing and perfect choice of track really make the scene in several episodes, particularly \"D City Rock\" and \"Fly Away\".\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this is a fun, beautifully drawn animation that doesn't take itself seriously. It knows it's not up there with the big-guns - and it doesn't try to be. It achieves everything it tries to, and excels at it.\\n\r\nAnything more would be overkill.",

            "content": "Well... Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt (I\u2019ll call it PSG in this article) was a delicious experience for me. I really appreciate all the non-sense work further combined with dirty jokes, direct and referential humor, a pinch of black humor and... bitching (laughs). By this mean, I bought the joke, the idea (more easily). However, those wasn\u2019t the only reasons that formatted my admiration. \r\nOther factors that pleased me was the animation, the art, the OST, the background of the series and the possible hidden ideas. The animation was incredible appealing, it was fluid and admirable with all those camera angles well worked and alluringto the eyes that had provided scenes that I can only describe as fascinating and out of the common.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was one of the series\u2019 strongest point. It served to soften all the visual aggression present among it. It contributed greatly for an appealing sense of humor and it has a gorgeous cartoon trace. It\u2019s crooked, shocking and\u2026 \u201cout of proportion.\u201d Allowing the execution of the slapstick comedy, bizarre and exaggerated expressions together with the character\u2019s design that can only be described as hideous.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is truly wonderful in behalf of the perfectly combination made within the scenes. Consecutively intensifying the exceptional feeling of that moment. A first-class example is the transformation scene (ow jeez, that is sooo beatiful). The music used on this part (Fly Away Now) gave with a correct sense the sexy and provoking sensation of the moment.\\n\\n\r\n Other interesting point is the dub eng, since the actor\u2019s voices combined with the characters simultaneously. Besides that, they had \u201cjokes\u201d with the way they talk. With completely caught me. Also, the way they used the onomatopoeia concept was amusing to my ears. In general, PSG is astonishing. However, in some points, the animation can lack behind. \\n\\n\r\nPSG follows an episode structure, and it got to define well the protagonist couple (Panty and Stocking) all together in the first frames. An interesting thing about it is the dichotomy between the characters, both in personality and in outfit (with caveats). Even the Garterbelt and the Chuck was defined as \u201cgenesis\u201d. Although it\u2019s not necessary. The structure is well functional because of the intriguing things that keep happening. For example, the dichotomous between epi 9 and the perception of boredom from the duo on epi 10-11. Apart from that the structure contributes (a little) with the main purpose: to be crazy; to attack YOU. Well... let\u2019s talk about this.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the PSG\u2019s humor is something dichotomous as I said previously. In other words, you love it or you hate it. The humor used on the series is eschatological, direct, purely aggressive, douchebag and... referential. IT IS VERY GOOD! Because Imaishi execute it sensationally. While growing, the series keep getting crazy (catarrh monster ----- > final plot twist). The structure in some episodes is half \u201cWTF?!\u201d as we can see at epi 10. The referential humor helps with the bizarre sensation as it gives a more comical air at the same time. However, the Japanese public disagree. WHY?\\n\\n\r\nWell... The answers are just theory. I even have my own. The more acceptable is that they didn\u2019t get the occidental referential humor and the final joke: \u201cWHY YOU KILLED MIIINEEE PANTY?!!\u201d. The other is that the post-credit scene is only Gainax\u2019s joke. And mine is... the Panty. She comes out completely away from the Japanese woman stereotype. and what they hate the most: Strong independent women who dominate their own sexuality. Based on that, the final was a \u201cpleasure\u201d to the public, representing this: \u201cthe (sick) woman pattern> the \u201calternative and bizarre kind\u201d woman pattern.\u201d HOWEVER, IT ARE JUST THEORIES.  \\n\\n\r\nPanty & Stocking with Garterbelt is astonishing. If you like non-sense things as South Park this anime CAN be for you. I appreciated soooo much the PSG series that it entered on mine top 5 animes of all time. I hope you enjoy it too(with this bullshit). See ya!      \\n",

However, after seeing a clip of the show on Jamie Marchi's (Panty's VA) Twitter, my sides were aching and i was begging for MORE!\r\nIts really hard to describe what makes this show funny. Its not only the jokes, but how the way the characters express themselves. The script writers and voice actors show true mastery of expression through spoken words here, and express only one goal: To make this as funnyas they possibly can. Its truely a show you have to see to believe.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is unorthodox, however it is very well done. Not to mention that its actually gorgeous as hell.  Honestly, dont turn this show down just for the art style like i did. I regret it so bad! I wish I had watched this show 5 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, the OP is kinda blah, however thats the only thing that i have to gripe about in terms of music.

            "content": "A good friend of mine suggested this anime to me, which I watched with an open mind. I thought it would be a good anime, but boy, was I wrong. \r\nEVERY SINGLE CHARACTER is unlikable. Especially Panty, who seems to get the most airtime, despite her swearing every five seconds and screwing practically every male she lays eyes on (only to treat them like dirt) . We get it, she's meant to be a slut. Stocking was rather boring, Garterbelt wasn't much better; at least Chuck provided a tiny amount of comic relief. The most promising characters were the Demon Sisters, Scanty and Kneesocks, butafter the love scene between them, that is when I stopped watching the show altogether. Of all the unlikable characters I've seen in anime, I would put Panty at number one. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, I don't see what is so 'genius' about this anime. Japan, if you think that the only thing Western humour relies on is swearing, sex jokes and toilet humour, you couldn't be more wrong. It's almost like you are basically trying to out-swear South Park. And even Family Guy has better humour. Panty is basically a complete rip-off of Yamada, the main character from the anime B Gata H Kei, which is superior in many ways. The sex jokes were stolen from Seitokai Yakuindomo, another superior (and underrated) anime. And the swearing (and sex jokes) get old so fast it's not funny. Seitokai Yakuindomo uses lots and lots of sex jokes, and, despite the fact they get repetitive, they actually work well, within the story. I can't explain how, but it's just the way I see it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only interesting thing about this anime which stuck with me was the artwork.",

This will be my shortest review on MAL because quite frankly, there's not a lot to go into. \r\nTo begin with, this series is far from controversial. DIVISIVE perhaps, but not controversial. I've seen worse from Aqua Teen Hunger Force for the love of god.\r\nThere is no animation like PSG. It's a fresh, new face in a medium where the norm is so much of the same. There's no moe characteristics here. No \"pure and innocent\" girls, made for theviewer to fall in love with. Quite frankly, Panty and Stocking are pretty much just hardcore bitches and to many a self-proclaimed \"otaku\", that must seem very threatening. At the same time, its western style (the show has more in common with western series like \"Venture Bros\" and \"Archer\" than any japanese animation I've seen) turns off many people who are devoted to japanese animation.\\n\\n\r\nPSG is either for you, or not. If it's NOT for you, then I think there's something wrong with YOU and not the series, but I digress. How do you decide which it is? Well, you could try watching it, but for your convenience, here's little guide. \\n\\n\r\nAre you not easily offended? Do you like animation regardless of where it's from? (again, PSG turns off many with its western style) Are you able to just sit back and ENJOY something every once in awhile? Are you tired of more of the same from your japanese animation? Most importantly: do you like to have a little something called FUN? Then PSG is for you.\\n\\n\r\nAre you very easily offended? Do you watch japanese animation because you feel that it is \"superior\" in some way to western animation? Do you watch japanese animation so that you can pretend you're into a superior medium than others? Does everything you watch need to be, or pretend to be \"deep\"? Then PSG is not for you. \\n\\n\r\nAs previously stated though, watch it yourself and form your own opinion. Or be easily offended and click \"not helpful\" on this review. All the same, really.",

You must not be offended by ecchi or swearing.\r\nNow I can start this review of Panty and Stocking.\r\nStory: The Story of Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt is about two angels called Panty and Stocking who are kicked out of Heaven for being foul mouthed and for also just being a bunch of bitchy angels in general . They are sent down earth to a church in the city called \"Daten City\". They have to collect enough Heaven Coins from ghosts they have tokill until there allowed back in heaven \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style is like a Western Cartoon. I really enjoyed how they adapted that kind of art into Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt to use this type of style was just amazing. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: Oh man. That soundtrack was amazing to Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. I mean just the opening song took me away. They did an excellent job for every single scene. Heck I had just to get soundtrack it was that good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The Characters, well there 8 main characters in total:\\n\\n\r\nThe Angel Sisters: Okay Panty and Stocking are both are in the title, they both use weapons that are guns and swords which were from Panties and Stockings. Stocking's weapon is a Sword while Panty's weapon is a Gun. They also have a pet called Chuck that looks like GIR from Invader Zim.\\n\\n\r\nThe Demon Sisters: Scanty and Ms. Kneesocks are the demon sisters. They are rivals of the Angel sisters. They also use the same kind of weaponry as the angel sisters. They also have pet like Chuck but he is called Fastener\\n\\n\r\nGarterbelt: Garterbelt is the church owner and high priest, also he looks after Panty and Stocking\\n\\n\r\nBreif: Breif or more commonly known as \"Geek-boy\" . He helps Panty and Stocking on some of their missions. He also loves Panty.\\n\\n\r\nCorset: Corset is the main bad character for Panty and Stocking. He is aslo the mayor of Daten City and he is the boss for the Demon Sisters. I can't say much about him, because it would spoil the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I had a blast with Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt, from the Story to Art to Soundtrack. I just loved it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I had a really great time with this anime and I'm giving Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt a 9/10\\n",

            "content": "Panty And Stocking With Garterbelt.... Just saying the title out loud can already describe the messed-up weirdness of this show. Created by GAINAX, the creators of FLCL and Gurren Lagann, Panty And Stocking is a wild, fast-paced and raunchy anime comedy that will blow your logical senses through the window.\r\nThe story takes place in Daten City, a town that's located between Heaven and Hell and ghosts always pop out to terrorize the citizens. That's where Panty And Stocking come in, 2 angels who fight against ghosts and exterminate them for good. They live in the church with a priest named Garterbelt, who's like a combinationof the personalities of Afro Samurai and Black Dynamite in one and a green dog named Chuck, but in reality they got kicked out of Heaven due to their bad attitude and must kill ghosts in order to gain \"Heaven Coins\" if they want to go back to Heaven. The story in the show is not always straight-forward like in most animes, but for me it's OK, cause this show is no even meant to be taken seriously and it's mostly about Pant And Stocking killing ghosts and earning their Heaven Coins, but don't let this text fool you by thinking that is boring. The various ghosts that they encounter in the series are so fucking messed up, like in the first episode where Panty And Stocking must fight a ghost who is made out of poop. Yes you heard me... A ghost that was created by our own shit... Mother of god. The characters are also fucked up, Panty is an angel who has an incredible ability to fuck a lot of hot men and without ever getting an infection, while Stocking is a goth chick who loves to eat sweets but somehow she doesn't get diabetes and did I mention that their weapons are clothes? Stocking's weapon can turned into a katana and Panty's weapon can turn into a powerful gun with infinite ammo that makes Dante's weapons from Devil May Cry look shit in comparison. The other characters like Garterbelt are even more messed up than Panty and Stocking, as Garterbelt likes too.... Uh.. likes too..... You know what? I'll let you see the show and figure out yourself instead.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can probably guess by now, Panty And Stocking is full of sexual humor and pop culture references from the West. Hell, the animation in the show feels more like a cartoon in the US than Japan. The sexual humor is actually pretty funny, but only if you can handle this kind of humor cause not many people like this sort of thing and other sexual jokes can get a little too sensitive in later episodes and it also makes fun of popular movies like Indiana Jones, High School Musical and even Transformers gets mocked in one episode. The animation by GAINAX is surprisingly solid and I'm actually glad that the animators went for a more western style on the animation but with a little bit of anime style flavor too. The backgrounds look nice and the models are well animated with good animation movements in the action scenes. It also uses live action scenes with the each ghost that gets defeated and ends up exploding into pieces and it just awesome to look at. The action scenes are phenomenal, every action set-piece is thrilling and non-stop excitement that the sense of fun always will get you pumped for the nest one, but the finale in the series is the real show-stealer but I will not spoil it... Sorry. The music in Pant and Stocking is pretty cool, it offers some very solid music tracks that fits the show's badass attitude and the song \"Fly Away\"... Well, it makes wanna dance on a stripper pole for hours to come. The voice acting is solid, but the English dub by Funimation is definitely the best. The English script offers far more funnier dialogue than the Japanese version and the cast is better, since this show is more for western audiences than Japanese audiences. Jamie Marchi and Monica Rial are incredibly fun to listen as the main heroines and their performances are incredibly rich and strong in their roles. Christopher Sabat was awesome as Garterbelt with his tough-ass attitude that he gives to his character and the rest of the cast did solid with their roles they had to perform with their voices for the chosen characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't had the chance to see this show, I recommend this to anyone who wants to have a hell of a good time with this series. Panty And Stocking is just so damn entertaining that words are incredibly weak to describe the awesomeness of this show. If you want some negatives for this show, here are 2 negatives that I had with this show: 1. The plot is hit or miss and it confusing to understand it and 2. There's a lot of sexual humor and it may turn off some anime fans. But whatever, go see this show, cause it kicks so much ass that you won't even care for the problems for the issues the show has.",

            "content": "I had high expectations for this anime after reading the raving reviews about Panty and Stocking. Unfortunately after watching the first episode, I was too bored to watch. Panty and Stocking is probably the only anime to date I have dropped after watching the first episode, although I watched the second episode before writing this review to reaffirm my hatred.\r\nPanty and Stocking has the same fatal flaw many live action comedy films fail in theaters. It\u2019s purely a comedy series, yet it is not funny. Without humor the show has absolutely nothing. Some of the bits, such as blatantly obvious model monster explosions could haveworked for me if the rest of the show wasn\u2019t so dull. A successful comedy should have you laughing more often than not. The momentum of hilarity can be more important than the value of a joke. Instead of laughing at the humorously overdone death animations, I was left spiting it along with the rest of the show. The sex jokes were overdone and I\u2019ve grown past the age where I would laugh at something just because it was a piece of shit.\\n\r\nThere is a large group of people who believe Panty and Stocking is a parody of how a majority of the animes produced are moe kawaii trash. One reviewer puts it as this: \u201cTo put it plainly, the entire point of this show is to take the illusions otaku have surrounded themselves with for the last 10 years and annihilate them through a wanton, infinite assault of sex and Western style\u201d  \\n\r\nReally?\\n\r\nNot being a K-on, Strike Witches, or To Love-Ru automatically makes it a parody of stereotypical otaku culture? The show does nothing to address anything about waifus. It is just different. \\n\r\nAnd Panty and Stocking does have fanservice. Chuck is Gir. What other purpose does he serve other than reminding viewers of Invader Zim. Don\u2019t pretend that just because the transformation scene could be a parody of other animu is enough to separate it from all the other scenes in animu just to please viewers.\\n\r\nYes I hate Panty and Stocking. I could have found some of the other aspects of the show, such as it\u2019s western style animation and music interesting but I don\u2019t care because it failed to be funny. If there was any plot, at least there would be reason to watch more, but Panty and Stocking bet everything on humor and it didn\u2019t work for me.\\n",

The characters are all epic. There's the wild party-type girl, Panty. The cutesy gothic girl, Stocking. The strict girl, Kneesocks. The snob, Scanty. The nerdy boy, Brief. The pet animal thingy, Chuck. And then last but notleast, the priest with alot of things sterotyped as \"very unreligious\". \\n\r\nI reccomend this if you really want some LOLs.",

            "content": "This isn't going to be an actual overall review of Panty and Stocking as much as a talking point on something about it that I came out with very mixed feelings about which is, for the lack of a better way to call it, the meta aspect of this show.\r\nFirst to give some structure to this, because if not I'm going to be all over the place, Panty and Stocking is a show that iterates between one of either 3 states: one of them is being very, very provocative either by being sexually charged, vulgar or just really nasty, the second state is when it'sbeing action packed, energetic, striking and a blast to watch and the last state it's when the show feels like it's just straight up trolling and laughing at its audience. That last part is mainly what I kind of mean by the \"meta\" aspect of it because this show demonstrates plenty of times that it can be exactly what the audience came for: a very provocative, over the top, action packed show with super striking visuals and an amazig soundtrack that pays plenty of homage to western cartoons and western media in general, and it feels like the creators know this and decided to sometimes tear it all apart in front of the audience for a while just to laugh at them for thinking that they're going to get what they want. A lot of people may think that I'm reading too much into it and that the \"trolling\" parts are the show trying to be funny or provocative in some way but failing spectacularly, being an overall hit or miss, and don't get me wrong I do think there are many moments in which the show is pretty hit or miss but there are many others like the mucus episode or the overly simplified flash-like animation of the beach episode (which Gainax normally uses for comedic effect as it clashes with the better looking scenes but here just felt incredibly pointless) or the first 80% of episode 10 which are moments that feel like the creators are knowingly trolling the audience, precisely in episode 10 after all of what felt like a completely inconsequential waste of time the show just so happens to end with one of the best moments of the entire series with the anarchy sisters song as to, again, remind us that it is completely capable of being great. (also, this is 2010 Gainax with none other than Hiroyuki Imaishi directing it, I could hardly think of a better staff capable of making a high quality show). Lastly, for one of the more indirect examples is Stocking's dating episode, looking at both Panty and Stocking it's not too hard to imagine that Stocking was going to be the fan favourite girl as she's a clear reference to all the \"goth girl\" archetype characters in western cartoons with the typical stand-offish action girl attitude so on the dating episode it's revealed that she has a huge genuine crush for really nasty, bad-mannered fat men without even really diving into why because the whole point of it was to crack her image and once again troll it's audience (to be honest that was one of the few moments in which I liked the trolling because I found it hilarious).\\n\\n\r\nMy whole point with this is that even if I think most of those moments were not good or enjoyable (because not being good was pretty much what they were designed to be) I have to admit I respect what Gainax went for, you know you have to get to someone's level when they are able to so effortlesly make something which could've been genuinely amazing that they just decide to every once in a while tear it apart just for the hell of it because who cares, I'm just kind of disappointed they chickened out and decided to actually give it a good proper ending instead of taking a metaphorical bat and breaking the whole show down like I was expecting them to do.",

            "content": "When I first went to watch this anime, the only review I read of it called it \"an R-rated version of Power-Puff Girls.\" This is still the most succinct and accurate description of this show, but I'll try to add a bit more detail to that fantastic synopsis.\r\nThe premise is almost exactly like Power-Puff Girls - a group of girls (albeit 2 instead of the 3 in PPG) under the direction of a teacher fight evil ghosts in mini episodes, and typically there are 2 \"episodes\" in a 24 minute segment. The animation, style, and story are very similar to the American version, and itclearly takes a lot of inspiration from American cartoons. The big difference is in the R rating, and boy does this show enjoy riding that R rating to its limit. Even though I'm a seasoned anime viewer, there were still moments in this anime that were almost too much for me to handle - from an episode of tissue paper ghosts that prevent men from wiping themselves after ejaculating, endless sexual jokes that go to the extreme, and any obscene material you can think of. Panty and Stocking relishes in offensive material, but if you're able to handle some crude and disgusting jokes, it pulls it off pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters are Panty - a girl constantly having sex who uses her panties as a weapon - and Stocking, a girl who uses her stockings as a weapon and is addicted to sweets. The two have a contentious relationship and are held (somewhat) in check by their handler, Garterbelt, who does his best to keep the girls focused on their missions but often loses his temper. This makes for a hilarious dynamic between the characters, and it is very amusing to watch as various missions get derailed by Panty's horny nature or Stocking's insatiable need for sweets. The voices are perfect for the characters as well, Panty being the classic \"bad girl\" anime voice with Stocking having  the \"smart/aloof\" stereotype.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is almost exactly like a PowerPuff Girls remake, so while I can't give it points for originality it does a great imitation and I like that style so no complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a fun, hilarious show that I really enjoyed, and other than a few weird episodes that maybe went a bit too far - one episode about a beaten down corporate worker that seemingly had little to do with the rest of the show and was strangely dark kind of threw me off - most of the show was light, entertaining, and hilariously raunchy. Would definitely reccomend for fans of American cartoons or raunchy humor. 8/10",

It just sounded so outlandish and my curiosity got the better of me! Within the first couple seconds I had my opinion--this is a disgustingly crude version of the Powerpuff Girls! But what else would you expect from the name? But still, I was giggling! So I paused the episode and went to look it up here on MAL, andthe reviews were surprisingly good. I thought, well, what do I have to lose except 30 minutes? Might as well finish the episode, since I was kinda giggling anyway...So I did. :)\\n\\n\r\nThis series is HIGHLY reminiscent of Powerpuff Girls in both premise and style (one of my very fave shows when I was younger), and so maybe this was a big appeal for me...But everything from the introduction to each episode to the awkward pauses and fast paced humour reminded me of PPG! Of course, wiiiiiiiith a dash of Spongebob Squarepants-esque humour (and random live action scenes), Ren & Stimpy crudeness (which I was never a fan of, and which I'm still not really a fan of in this show but I digress), with a pinch of Drawn Together shock humour, all with Japanese comic flare!\\n\\n\r\nThe art is done amazingly well--while I can't say I'm a huge fan of all of the character designs (the dog thing grosses me out), the animation is very clear and fluid. I haven't noticed the sound much yet, but their \"angels fly away\" song or something when they transform sounded pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was surprisingly enjoyable to watch. It was almost like I wasn't watching an anime at all with the Western style and humour, but subtle hints did remind me. I definitely found myself laughing when I expected to not like the series AT ALL when I first saw it. I give it an overall rating of 8 for its sheer enjoyable-ness! But I also take away points for the crudeness I don't really find appealing.",

            "content": "Well, when I first heard that Gainax was creating an anime with a lot of american-style animation, and with an absurd title that included the words \u201cPanty and stocking\u201d, I literally had no idea what to expect. However, considering how almost all anime nowadays seems to be playing things safe (moe, fanservice stuff that sells and makes money), Panty and Stocking turned out to be a refreshing experiment to see in action.\r\nAdmittingly, this show definitely is not for everybody; there is plenty of blatant sex, ghosts based on fecal matter or semen, panties and stockings raining down from the sky. Yea, this show is verydaring with it\u2019s content, has a ton of fanservice, and is quite innuendo heavy. Even so, I\u2019m more surprised with the fact that Gainax actually went ahead and made a show like this (which, at times, was actually almost stopped from being aired), and it turning out rather good.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was definitely a huge experiment, breaking plenty of stereotypes and implementing some pretty absurd (yet new) ideas. It\u2019s clearly visible that there is a lot of influence from American cartoons, prevalent in both the art style and the story format in each episode. There really wasn\u2019t much of an overarching plot for this show (well, except for the last few episodes), but each episode served to parody a ton of different pop culture references. We got a Transformers parody, an Invader Zim homage, and a lot more random parodies and references. Not to mention, the soundtrack for this series was pretty darn good, with quite a few great pieces throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll admit that a good amount of the parody episodes were just for some cheap laughs, but there were a few rare gems amidst everything, such as Stocking\u2019s romance episode as well as the final arc involving Panty and Brief. That being said, the main characters (Panty and Stocking) were a little one-dimensional and one sided, with not much variety in their actions and mannerisms.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, they were a rather charming duo to watch, especially during the episodes in which their characters really do shine. The main problem here was that there was very little changes in the actual characters, which meant that the only pillar of support for the story was the sheer level of energy, as well as odd plot twists, that kept the show going.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the animation in this show was excellent, with a great visual direction during certain key scenes. The battle scenes were especially something to look forward to, with some amazing over the top battles throughout the series. All in all, this show has created it\u2019s own little niche in a sense, though it did also lack direction with it\u2019s one-dimensional characters. This show definitely could have used some improvements (such as a more coherent overall plot, perhaps), but in the end Panty and Stocking turned out to be a surprisingly solid show, and most important of all, it was rather charming and fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nProduction Quality: 9.0/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.0/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSetting: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 8.0/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nFeedback and comments (as well as criticisms) are always welcome :)",

            "content": "One of the most admirable things about this show as a whole, to me, is its refusal to take anything seriously. The characters, the situations they find themselves in, the script, down to the very plot - everything is chopped, screwed, and stretched to the extreme. If you're looking for something serious, or with a basic level of consistency, you should look elsewhere.\r\nAnd yet, because of its fast-and-loose approach, it's managed to pull a fiercely loyal fanbase and maintained its place among the pantheon of in/famous shows since its release. It's incredibly crude, very silly to the point of being obnoxious, and features characters whohave continued to exist beyond the show. It's often cute, pretty funny, and features strong female characters. I didn't walk away from this with any major investment in it, nor am I one of the many left pining for a second season, but I do think there's something more interesting than the basic gross-out humor and ridiculousness of the show, and that something might be worth your attention for 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe first part of that something is its playfulness. My introduction to the show was as an extremely crude take on the Powerpuff Girls, where cute, benevolent heroes are replaced by selfish, stupid angels who defeat evil incidentally or only after being prodded enough. Many people will pant over their 'sexy' transformation scenes, but no sooner will you see them naked than they will be submerged in literal waves of shit, piss and vomit. Sexuality isn't sexy here - it's cheap, silly, and over-the-top, tempting fanboys looking for naked chicks while offering an ironic or humorous edge that gives it more substance.\\n\\n\r\nTheir selfishness, their hard individualism, makes Panty and Stocking stand out as characters - Panty may often wield her sexuality like her eponymous weapon, but the show makes it clear she's her own person no matter how many men she hooks up with. While Stocking is the more responsible of the two, she's hardly self-sacrificing and would rather be eating sweets than saving the world. They may not be nice, but their antisocial behavior has what I'd call a subversive sheen to it, something that rebels against what we're supposed to be, regardless or perhaps because of how stupid an nonsensical it all is.\\n\\n\r\nI will point out that, despite these interesting elements, this show receives a rather modest 7 from me. There are some episodes that dragged, or humor that missed the mark. The ghost of a metaplot regarding the two demon sisters was light on content while also managing to take up space that could have been used other ways. I'm more than happy to go with plot elements that seem confusing or contradictory, but there are a few times when I think it hurt how the episodes played out. Outside of Panty and Stocking the characters are pretty bland. The soundtrack was pretty good outside of a few acerbic pieces (Fly Away will be forever scratched into my memory), and the English voice-acting was flat and uninteresting - my suggestion would be to stick with the Japanese original.",

            "content": "\"Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt: An Exercise in Just Being Fun\"\r\nWhile I usually reserve the 8-9-10 tier of movies and TV for strictly intelligent and clever productions, I recently watched a show that was so well executed and so enjoyable that it practically left me no choice but to rethink my grading scale. \r\nThat show was none other than Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt, a fun little answer to the Powerpuff Girls released back in 2010 by Gainax. Panty and Stocking takes the Saturday morning cartoon approach of being episodic in nature and not having a continually flowing narrative. The big difference between Panty andStocking and your average kid's cartoon show though, is massive, and it's what sets it apart from the rest of the fodder.\\n\\n\r\nPanty and Stocking is raunchy and vulgar as fuck. It doesn't give a shit about being smart or being emotional; this show just wants to have a great time and take anyone bold enough to join it on one hell of a ride. This is also an anime that personally I prefer the dubbed version over the subtitled. Reason being is that the voice acting in the American version is so shamelessly over the top that I can't get enough of it. It's fucking wonderful and fun, just as it should be. I understand that people really like the \"RURURURU\" thing from the subtitled version, but honestly I just prefer it dubbed. Personal preferences, I suppose. \\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of Panty and Stocking that sticks out is its visual appeal. The art style on display here is far more Americanized than your average anime, if you will. Action is fast-paced, violent, and loose, and the overall structure of the world and characters is lined with sharper edges and borders than you're used to. What I mean by that is that it abandons any notion of a realistic art style and puts all its chips on \"cartoony as fuck\" and again, I feel this was the perfect approach for this production. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters and story aren't really the stronger areas, but I'll brush over them briefly. Panty is a slut and Stocking loves chocolate. Garterbelt has a fetish I can't even talk about on this site, and Brief is a nerdy and awkward kid hiding a huge secret underneath those messy bangs of his. Those are the only characters that really matter, so there. I'm ignoring Scanty and Kneestocks here mostly because I can't really describe them as having significant personalities; they feel more like accessories to the plot. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, it isn't really all that interesting. The angels (Panty and Stocking) have to collect 100 coins or something to get back into heaven. It's more of a token plot to move characters and production along, so don't think as though I'm ignoring it because I find it boring. No, the overall plot just doesn't matter. It's rarely brought up and is pretty much swept under the rug for most of the episodes. While I do feel that this was probably the right approach, I still think it could have been done better. Really though, I'm pleased with what I got and I can't complain too much about the story.\\n\\n\r\nNow where this anime truly shines is the music. Holy fucking shit, the soundtrack is amazing. Nearly every song will make you want to dance, and I can easily say the entire soundtrack is worth buying. It's that damn good. Both the opening and closing songs are amazing, and the angel transformation song, \"Fly Away Now\", is so much fun that it practically steals the show every time it's placed in the show. All in all, a fantastic soundtrack that perfectly fits this show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. It's fun, raunchy, aggressive, unique, creative, and a breath of fresh air. If I'm being completely honest here, P&S is actually my favorite of the golden age Gainax productions (TTGL, NGE, P&S, and FLCL being the cream of the crop here). Watch Panty and Stocking if you want to see what it's like when a production focuses on and succeeds at just being fun and enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nPanty and Stocking with Garterbelt earns an 8/10.",

            "content": "SPOILERS ARE IN THIS REVIEW. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO READ ANY SPOILERS FOR THIS ANIME, PLEASE DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER!!\r\n(I also compare Panty and Stocking to a few western cartoons, because the creators got a lot of influence from western animation and culture. It only made sense to me to do so.)\r\nPanty and Stocking with Garterbelt follow the adventures of two angels that have been sent to Earth for being jerks. Now, their only way back is to earn \"heaven coins\", once they earn enough, they can make it back through the pearly gates.\r\nPanty, a sex-crazed rebel, and Stocking, a sugar lovinggoth, have to earn these heaven coins by taking out demons in a \"demon-of-the-week\" fashion, with the help of Brief, a geeky klutz, and Garterbelt, a very\u2026very weird priest with a mysterious past. Along the way, they encounter demonic sisters, and a man named Corset, the mayor of the town, and they plan on ridding the world of Panty and Stocking and taking over the world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt is a simple premise, but man does the show do a lot with it!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s discuss why Panty and Stocking is so great.\\n\\n\r\n While it doesn't always seem the most appealing, I feel Panty and Stocking isn't trying to be the best-looking anime out there. It is trying to parody what is commonly expected in the animation department for anime, which can lead to the show flipping between animation genres frequently. Panty and Stocking can jump into flash, live action, hand drawn, CGI, and all of these things can literally be in the span of a few seconds. It is quite impressive! \\n\\n\r\nPanty and Stocking parody popular anime, movies, western animation and culture in general...like, Transformers, Phoenix Wright, They \"briefly\" mention Indiana Jones, Dirty Harry, Ghostbusters, The Powerpuff Girls, South Park, Ren and Stimpy, Barbie Dolls, Sex and the City, Death Race 2000, Dawn of the Dead, Star Wars...So. Many. Things. Some of it is very sneakily put in as well, which can really catch the viewer off guard. \\n\r\nWhile the show's gross out humor, and overuse of sexual jokes can be a turn off to some, I think the very idea of gross out humor is put on full display here. Something gross in, say, Spongebob, is an episode like the Splinter\u2026In Sanjay and Craig, giving birth to a fart, or Stimpy from Adult Party cartoon having one poop joke be the entire premise behind an episode...\\n\\n\r\nWhile these shows do not portray this kind of gross out through the entire run, except for Adult Party Cartoon, they still show the wrong way to do gross-out humor, in my opinion. Gross-out humor should over-exaggerate the grossness of a scenario to make it funny; the situations in the episodes I brought up however simply do nothing with the fact that something gross is happening on screen, they each take the situations and play them realistically. Which is boring.\\n\r\n Panty and Stocking, however, goes WAY over the top with its gross out humor, making a lot of it work. Also, when something gross is on screen, it is never there for too long. Say for instance, the episode \"The Runny\" which is all about...picking boogers!\\n\\n\r\nBecause of course it is. Just bear with me for a sec.\\n\\n\r\nPanty and Stocking are invited onto the blimp of a man named \"Oscar H. Genius\", voiced by none other than Vic Mignogna.\\n\\n\r\nPanty and he form an unusual bond...but, Panty soon finds out Oscar is a demon named Ugly Snot, trying to get everyone to fetishize picking their nose, which will inevitably blast them off to the moon using the knock back power of their own nosebleeds.\\n\r\nIs the plot gross? Yes, but nothing shown on screen is that disgusting, and everything moves by so fast, with a barrage of jokes and character interactions, I didn't seem to mind. Plus, the scenario is so far out of the realm of plausibility, you can look past the gross stuff, and laugh at how far the entire thing is going. \\n\r\nFor a better look into why I believe Panty and Stocking\u2019s gross out works, let\u2019s look into another episode!\\n\\n\r\n\"Vomiting Point\", is a gross episode toward the end, but it has such an amazing story from the start, you get easily sucked into what is going on. Let me run it by you really quick, so you can see it from my point of view.\\n\\n\r\nIn this episode, the main character is an older man named Terao, and he is having a rough life; both at work and at home. At work, Terao is hassled by his boss, and at home things seem mundane and unexciting. This is all played realistically, even down to the art style. \\n\r\nWhile Terao is at home, his young daughter asks for an autograph from \"Panty and Stocking\" for her birthday the next day, and Terao finds out about who they are. Terao goes back to work, is hassled even more, and winds up having to drink an entire tower of beer, which leads him to vomit, and a ghost that had been possessing him takes over that puke and starts terrorizing the city. \\n\r\nPanty and Stocking show up near Terao to defeat this ghost, and he tries talking them into coming to his house to see his daughter. Panty and Stocking decline, weirded out by the old man, but decide to give him an autograph for the heck of it. Terao's daughter receives this from him, and the end has Terao, again, begin hassled by his boss. It is hinted that Terao\u2019s is respected a bit more, but it is only something I can assume; not something I am entirely sure of because of where the episode leaves off.\\n\\n\r\nNow, why would I like this episode since I said earlier that I do not like gross out being portrayed realistically? Well, towards the end of this episode the entire scenario is played up for its absurdity; where this episode passes the others, like Spongebob\u2019s the splinter and Adult Party Cartoon, is how it is set-up. Where Adult Party Cartoon and Spongebob started on the same level of gross and weird throughout, and threw in a slight bit of realism, Vomiting Point was realistic until the situation comes to a head, and the gross out becomes absurd. Also, the \u201cvomit\u201d sequences aren\u2019t on the screen too long, and aren\u2019t really that gross to begin with. \\n\r\nHow does this episode justify the gross scenarios then? Well\u2026\\n\r\nIt is such a sad episode, and really does throw you off the first time seeing it. I think Vomiting Point is more of a play on realism vs. escapism, and how real life is tough; sometimes, the best you can do is grin and bear it...the cartoons that you love will never be around long enough to save you from how tough life can be, and you should celebrate your tiniest victories no matter what they are. Remember what you are living for, put those you love first. At least that is what I thought.\\n\r\n It is visually interesting, and really thought provoking. All of that from an episode with a pretty gross premise. If you aren\u2019t a fan of gross out humor, I still strongly suggest you give Panty and Stocking a try. It does a lot with its look, and there is more to it than what might appear on the outside.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise, Panty and Stocking does have a story; to stop the demon sisters from taking over the world, which progressively becomes a bigger threat as the series continues, and to bust the weekly ghost. It is a little more to it than that later in the series, but that is pretty much it. Unlike most anime that follows a story, Panty and Stocking is mostly episodic; they can die one episode, be brought back, and die again the next episode. The story's, while not the most amazing stories ever told, are funny, fast-paced, silly, and really feel like you are stepping into the lives of these goofball characters. The story does pick up a bit more and become more important as the first season continues, but for the most part the series does remain episodic.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, a lot of the people in Panty and Stocking are really wacky, colorful, weird, incredibly disturbing, and I love every bit of it. Please trust me when I say this show has incredibly endearing, likable, and charming characters, despite the gross and weird nature of the episodes these characters get stuck in. While Panty and Stocking are rather mean, they still hold a very charming and enjoyable presence with them.  My favorite characters are probably \"The Demon Sisters\", though Scanty and Kneesocks. They make for an excellent foil for Panty and Stocking; Where Panty and Stocking are gross, nasty, foul mouthed angel's, Kneesocks and Scanty are respectable, rule following, demons who love morals. Scanty and Kneesocks, are the hero's you want, but you are left with Panty and Stocking; these rude, jerks...it is clever, and adds for a nice change of pace from regular shows, where the hero is typically nice and respectable, and the major villains typically aren't. Some may find Panty and Stocking\u2019s jerkishness to be a bit jarring, but these characters do get there commupins for being so horrible; and as the series progresses, you do see changes in the characters. Panty and Stocking learn to appreciate Brief and Garterbelt better in a very subtle and charming manner. You also learn why these character\u2019s act the way they do, and you\u2019re even presented with a sweeter side of each of them. Like, for Stocking in \u2018Ghost; The Phantom of Datencity\u201d and for Panty in \u2018Panty and Brief\u2019. Pretty much, what Panty and Stocking lack in story, they make up for in character; and they go well above the call of duty the show really loves that kind of humor too; any situation that Panty and Stocking can show their butts in, both literally and figuratively, they will do it and exaggerate it to a whole new level of weird. \\n\\n\r\nThe over the top action...goodness...let me just say, this show has incredible action. When Panty and Stocking first meet Scanty and Kneesocks, the fight goes from underground in the sewers, to the bathroom, to driving up a building, two cars racing and tearing through the thin halls of a high school, to the roof of Datencity High. I can't do it justice, but know these episodes are eleven minutes long and all of this was put into that short span of time. Kudos, writers! This action is entertaining, quick, and filled with different animation types and one-liners. It's great, and adds for some tense, weird action. Trust me when I say weird. One action scene involves Panty\u2019s weapon of choice getting stuck to the face of a ghost disguised as a vehicle; and the action with this scene lasts the entire length for the episode, besides the opening sequence. And that is the second episode of the show!\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe last point I am going to be making here is about the end of series. So, if you don\u2019t want a major spoiler, just know\u2026SPOILERS ARE AHEAD... AGAIN.\\n\\n\r\nSo, toward the end of the series after Corset has been defeated and Stocking returns from heaven\u2026well\u2026Stocking just kills Panty. In a very brutal, over the top fashion; she dices her in cubes, says she is a ghost and runs away with Corset (who is like\u2026a jellybean thing?) to try to take over the world elsewhere. \\n\r\nA lot of people seem to really hate this because of how quickly the event happened, but I didn\u2019t have that much of a problem with it. \\n\r\nWhy? A few reasons. For one, this felt more like a parody on how some shows will leave you dangling on this massive cliffhanger without any response at all. Judging by the other character\u2019s interactions about this, I can only see this being that; a parody. The violence was so over the top and foolish too, of course it will catch you off guard, but that is the joke. Plus, Panty and Stocking have died in previous episodes, or have found themselves on the rough end of a situation, for only the episode to end like that. It is meant to be exaggerated and played for laughs.\\n\\n\r\nIf that excuse doesn\u2019t work for you, there is an episode that kind of foreshadowed these events, \u201cGhost; the Phantom of Datencity\u201d a season two? Stocking falls in love with a ghost that all the humans, and angels find disgusting. Something that apparently isn\u2019t too common. COINCIDENCE? I THINK NOT!\\n\\n\r\nInteresting enough, there are hints floating around that Panty and Stocking might get a second season, though, this has not been fully confirmed yet by Studio Gainax, but just now that there is a HIGH..HIGH possibility that a second season is underway. And the creators enjoy the idea of sticking with Stocking being a demon, Scanty keeping her sex-juice-induced scar on her face\u2026. Lots of that can be found in the wiki article linked below.\\n\\n\r\n[SEASON TWO OF PANTY AND STOCKING INFO|http://psg.wikia.com/wiki/User_blog:B\u00fctterfly/The_OVA_and_Season_2\\n\\n\r\nIf that wiki article isn\u2019t enough for you, how about the actual Japanese voices for for Panty and Stocking discussing season 2 as their characters?\\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-5ZN-ed8AA\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s just say, I wouldn\u2019t worry about the ending too much for any longer.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI love this series, and I proudly say it is my favorite anime of all time. It is fun, and even if it is a bit crass and vulgar, I think it is an anime that everyone should check out. It is something different, and dares to stand out. There is a sea of anime that I sometimes have trouble telling apart from other anime. But, Panty and Stocking will always be something I can recognize; both because of the art style and the dialogue. It came at a time when I needed to laugh the most, and it did that with spades.\\n\\n\r\nWith that underway, thank you all for reading this! Have a good day.\\n",

            "content": "VERY MINOR SPOILER ALERT\r\nPanty & Stocking with Garterbelt is a western adult cartoon inspired series about two fallen angels; sisters Panty and Stocking Anarchy. They must hunt and destroy ghosts on Earth to earn their way back into Heaven with the help of their caretaker (of sorts), Garterbelt, and their dog, Chuck. This series pushes the limit on just about every topic it can. The series is crude, explicit to the extreme, borderline pornographic... and it's glorious. The Anarchy sisters have certainly earned their surname. I fell in love with all the main characters instantly, and I enjoyed seeing the ridiculous (and gross) ghosts theyhad to face. \\n\\n\r\nI feel as though they could've introduced Scanty and Kneesocks sooner, because until they came around, all conflicts with ghosts seemed completely random, but perhaps that give the series a bit more element of surprise.\\n\\n\r\nAfter episode six, there is a bit too much filler for my tastes. Much of it wasn't even enjoyable filler. It felt as though the creators were attempting to make the viewers as confused and/or grossed-out as much as they possibly could before an intense final 2-3 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nI was immensely satisfied with the final episode right up until the final minute or so, where a shocking (and nonsensical, if you ask me) end awaits you, should you watch past the closing song. Supposedly, it is a playful nudge at studio Gainax endings, but I personally was very upset.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style for 90% of the series is initially... disgusting. There are a few shots throughout the series of gorgeous animation, \\n\\n\r\nbut it's not nearly enough to save you from the pure cringe of the main art style. That said, it actually fits the entire series very well, and the art style will become more and more charming as you bond with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the main points preventing it from being one of my favorites is the extreme amount of gross-out scenes, the dragging bits of filler, and the ending. Regardless, I still enjoyed the series as a whole, and I haven't lost any love for the characters or atmosphere of the series.\\n\\n",

I have rewatched it several times and I always find it just as enjoyable as the first time, it always manages to crack me up, and its one of the few shows where I prefer the dubbed version over the subbed. The art is different from the more \"traditional\" artstyles, it has more of a cartoon-ish feel but I think it works very well with this one. Anyways, I would 100% recommend thisto someone with perhaps a more crude sense of humor.",

It's a great parody of American culture through the eyes of a Japanese person. It's a must watch to any American, but as a European I still enjoyed it. It was incredibly crazy and off the wall, but in a good way. The characters are incredibly fun and the story doesn't exist, but it doesn't haveto be. There are tonne of references to American culture. See if you can spot them all.",

            "content": "I'm going to start this review off with a precursor: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt is a show that originally came out when I was 14. A lot of my friends at the time really enjoyed it, however, I never watched it because I was a dumb kid who couldn't figure out how to.\r\nNow, as an adult, I often go into the entertainment trade store and check the World Cinema section, which as you can imagine, has anime. I saw the DVD and decided to pick it up, and finally give this anime a go.\r\nAs you can tell by my score, it wasn't to mytaste.\\n\\n\r\nFirst things first, I want to address a point. Whenever someone dislikes this anime, the thing that's often brought up is \"Is it because of it's similarities to Western cartoons or its art style?\" It's neither. I actually thought the art was stylish, fun and quirky. Same can be said about the music, albeit I wouldn't listen to it outside of this anime because most of it is arguably not very good. It did fit in with the vibe of the anime though, and I can definitely give it props for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that I didn't enjoy about it was the humor. I was expecting a show that satirised Western cartoons, but rather what I got was the exact same lowbrow humor that can be found in Western primetime cartoons. I'm not saying I went into Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt expecting anything intellectually stimulating, but rather, I expected something executed with a bit more finesse, and focus on parody rather than reinforcing the same tropes that I feel it was trying to mock.\\n\\n\r\nI'm fine with crude humour. I enjoyed Space Dandy. I'm fine with sex jokes. I found B-gata H-kei endearing and funny and it essentially relied on them. So what's my issue with Panty & Stocking?\\n\\n\r\nIt's simple: The humor is far too obtuse to a point where it's not funny or relatable, and at times, is flat out unwatchable. Many of the jokes just left me wincing, and others were so disgusting they were difficult to stomach. For many of the jokes, the punchline was simply how vulgar or ridiculous the scenario or dialogue of the titular characters is. It's shock based humor, which after being on the internet for 8 years, and frankly, growing into a mature adult, does nothing for me.\\n\\n\r\nPanty & Stocking was at its best in episodes that didn't rely on toilet humor as its one and only gag, but they were so few and far between that they were essentially non-existent. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think I was too late for the trend, and 14 year old me would've found this show funnier and more enjoyable than 21 year old me.",

            "content": "Hello ladies and gentlemen of the internet, my name is Luis and today I\u2019ll be reviewing Japan\u2019s racist yet somehow accurate view of America better known as \u201cPanty & Stocking with Garterbelt\u201d.\r\nThere's a video version of the review in the link below if you don't feel like reading\r\n(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCIG1fBmNAQ)\r\nPanty & Stocking are two fallen angels that are forced to buy their way back into heaven due to their sinful nature. In other words Panty is a gigantic whore that will fuck anything that has a dick and Stocking is a would-be lardass due to all of the sweets she consumes on a daily basis, except thatand I quote: \u201call of her weight goes to her boobs\u201d. Well that pretty much concluded every will I had of cursing for the rest of the video. Oh that\u2019s another thing, the characters of this anime curse as easily as you breathe keep that in mind.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters & Synopsis:\\n\r\nOutside of the aforementioned Panty & Stocking, the series also has Garterbelt a stereotypical black catholic priest that likes little boys, a wannabe dog named Chuck that looks like Gir from Invader Zim, Briefers a weakling nerd that is in love with Panty but only ends up as the sex toy of Garterbelt most of the time, and finally the Demon sisters Scanty and Kneesocks which only live to try to be better than Panty and Stocking but failing every single time. With that said, the premise of the show is as stated before with a monster of the week kind of thing in the early episodes and a little story arc towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Soundtrack:\\n\r\nStudio Gainax is famous for always experimenting around with their works and this anime was no exception as Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt is the most Americanized anime of all times, to the point that if it was aired on Comedy Central along with South Park nobody would know that this is an anime. With that said, the animation fits the show down to a tea as the show is nothing more than a satire of everything American, or \u2018Murica to those overly proud of the motherland.\\n\r\nAs with the animation, the soundtrack for Panty & Stocking is nothing special anywhere outside of the show itself but it fits it very well. A special notice should be made to the song performed in episode 10 titled \u201cD City Rock\u201d by TeddyLoid and Debra Zeer, outside of the song being extremely catchy and perverted just like the rest of the series, it is a gigantic homage to a huge numbers of artists and rock bands like Def Leppard, Nirvana, Queen, KISS, Lady Gaga, Jimmy Hendrix and others.\\n\r\nAs for whether this anime is better subbed or dubbed it really comes down to your own taste but the dubbed is done in such a wonderfully fitting way that I find it hard to believe anyone that would choose the subbed version.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Scores:\\n\r\nAs for final ratings I give Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt a Critical Score of 7.3 out of 10, a Personal Enjoyment Score of 8.5 out of 10 and a Rewatch Value of 4.0 out of 5.\\n\r\nFor alternate animes recommendations I suggest the other Gainax What The Fuck Am I Watching work known as FLCL as both shows simply make want to say What The Fuck at least once in every episode and both have over-the-top characters that would never fit into the fabric of reality.",

            "content": "It's really hard to rate this anime because it really is between horrible and incredibly good.\r\nAnd this is a fact for every aspect that you can rate :\r\n-Story :For the first 6 episodes, nothing happens, the stories are not related to each other and if you skipped episode 2,3,4,5,6 you wouldn't even notice it. But after the introduction of (minor spoiler ahead) the demon sisters who are reversed mirror images of Panty and Stocking the story begins to have some real interesting twists, but it still isn't a great story that will change your world.\r\nBut let's be honest, you do not watch this anime forthe story, I actually don't know why you would watch this anime, I still don't know why I watched it. Because this anime is just full of sex and other dirty jokes, in a weird way this anime is more perverted than a hentai, you don't see anything that would be NSFW, but what is said is so much more intense. It can be funny to some people (including myself) but sometimes it is just so ridiculous that I almost dropped the episode. For example : (I'm about the story of 2 episodes but this can hardly be counted as a spoiler) \\n\r\nIn the very first episode the enemy is a ghost who is eating people by sucking them into the toilets, this is one of the worst enemies in this anime but in another one P&S are fighting dead fapping soldiers' ghosts who are destroying tissues because they couldn't fap anymore or some weird ridiculous sh*t like that. These weren't even funny anymore, they were just ridiculous (and I mean this in a bad way), but overall somehow this anime is entertaining enough to keep you from dropping it.\\n\\n\r\n-Art : I think I never saw that much different art styles in a single anime ! The usual style used is an art resembling american cartoons and I actually thought that P&S was a weird anime made by an american studio (even though I watched it in japanese). This is only my opinion, buy it took me sometime to accept this style, I really found it ugly and not at all pleasing to watch, but after some episodes I got used to it. But then there are other art styles that you can divide in 2 categories :\\n\r\nThe reference/serious art style which is used for secondary characters to make a reference to another anime or game or comic etc or to give an ambiance to the scene that will make it look more serious than the usual (which is really hard considering that the perverted and dirty jokes are still there)\\n\r\nThe attractive art style which is used for Panty, Stocking and the 2 demons. Once again I will be revealing some stuff about the anime but you learn this in the first episode so it still isn't a real spoiler. So that being said Panty is called so because the uses her panties to make a weapon and Stocking is called so because she uses her stockings to make a weapon. So almost every time they use their \"weapons\" we get to watch a couple of seconds of how they transform themselves in an art style where they actually look hot and attractive and which is more like the usual way anime characters are represented. \\n\r\nThis mashup of styles is a bit weird some times but isn't disturbing and adds a bit of atmosphere to the anime\\n\\n\r\nSound : I actually don't care that much about sound in animes and especially in this one, the voices are good (at least in japanese) except the one of Garterbelt who for some reason annoys me every time he speaks. The opening is short and the music is not really remarkable but the music when P&S are transforming is actually pretty catchy\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : There aren't many main characters in this anime so let's make this quick.\\n\r\nPanty is a sex addict, and it also took me some time to find her interesting because in the first episode that's all what is shown about her : rude and craving for sex at any moment. But while she still is always looking for sex, she gets a bit more of character especially in her fights with her sister which makes her look a bit more interesting\\n\r\nStocking is a sugar addict and is actually one of the main reasons for why I watched this show. She is kind of cute thanks to her voice and how she is behaving when she can eat, and she achieves to be funny and not in some perverted way. Her reactions to situations are maybe what makes her the most interesting ; she stays cold and still in many situations but totally freaks out when she can't get her pudding or cake.\\n\r\nGarterbelt is playing the role of the father of P&S but I don't know why he annoys me, his voice is unpleasing and he doesn't bring much, he's just the one giving the missions and is also the \"useful plot twister\" if I can say so\\n\r\nThere are other characters but I won't reveal them, but to say a quick word about them, they get interesting personalities and if they will not surprise you, they are entertaining and funny enough\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment + Overall: Well as long as Garterbelt is not talking and the monsters are not completely ridiculous. It is the weirdest yet one of the funniest animes I ever watched. I had a very good time watching this anime, I also had many WTF moments where I really didn't really understand what was happening and most importantly why it was happening but it still was funny. This anime is rude filled with perversion and foul elements but it amazing how the most random elements put together made such an incredible anime thus making it an outstanding masterpiece to me.",

            "content": "If South Park had to be produced by Gainax, this would be the result.\r\nThis FLCL-like show had me skeptical, as the old saying goes: \"Never judge a book by its cover.\" \r\nI must confess, the soundtrack (rave/club songs for the most part, but GOOD, colorful, music nonetheless, I cannot get enough it now, and I'm an avowed metal fan.) was what got me motivated, not so much interested, to give the show a shot. Midway through the first episode, I was convinced this was not a run-of-the-mill show. It breaks all walls, rules, and I became hooked. \r\nThe story is something I don't think anyperson can make up off the top of their head: two protagonists, Panty and Stocking, are angels sent by Heaven, turning panties into guns and stockings into swords and fighting evil. Their \"boss\" is a black priest with an afro named Garterbelt who has a penchant for young boys and sexual fetishes. Every character is named after an undergarment of some sort. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, I really wish I was making this up.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation speak for themselves; VERY stylized and diverse, through and through. I don't think I've seen any other show implement the approach seen in the show.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a well-executed, incredibly fun show that does not take itself seriously at all and really pushes the envelope in terms of sexual innuendo. The more you watch in shock, the less you even notice it anymore. It becomes all the more normal; an interesting phenomenon. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want a wild and crazy comedic anime that knows no rules, you've found it.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Panty and Stocking is not your usual anime. I know many of you have read this before but it is true. The characters, the artwork-everything about it manages to stand out from most animes. \r\nStory: 7\r\nPretty much, Panty and Stocking are fallen angels who are kicked out of heaven for being bitches and to get back they must kill all of the ghosts haunting Daten City. These ghosts are not your usual floating bed sheets. These ghosts are composed of actual crap, throw up, and one even has breasts that squirt some sort of cream. If you don't have a strong stomach, I wouldn't recommendwatching this series. Aside from the ghost hunting, Panty and Stocking tend to get themselves in pretty silly situations. One whole episode is dedicated to them sitting in their living room, complaining about their hunger, and having random conversations. That's all there is and it still managed to be one of my favorite episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nIf you've seen the main image for this anime, you would know that the characters aren't the slightest bit close to the usual anime style. Panty and Stocking are short with thick legs, exaggerated hair, huge hands, and not all that curvacious bodies. Even though it doesn't follow the usual \"kawaii-desu\" style most animes try to pull off, it's beautifully drawn and it's not like Panty and Stocking are unappealing to look at. Then we have the girl's transformation scenes when the girls are given revealing outfits to barely cover their suddenly tall, statuesque, and overall sexy forms. This style of art occurs rarely, almost playing as a cock tease for all the otakus and weeaboos who are displeased that these girls aren't always drawn this way. \\n\\n\r\nThe scenery is also fairly cartoonish. Daten City is the slightest bit similar to Townsville with tall buildings and plenty of clouds. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nOh god, that soundtrack. Panty and Stocking surely isn't an anime filled with bubblegum pop themes. They scrap this for techno meets electronic meets dance music filled with literal sex moans. Yes, you heard me right. Try looking up \"Pantscada\" and having a drinking game over how many moans you here. No, better yet look up \"Juice\". \\n\\n\r\nThe OST still has a few mellow songs. \"Chocolat\" is appropriately sweet and cute with some gracious French. \"Fallen Angel\" is definitely one of the best ending themes I've heard a long with a strangely cheery animation of Panty and Stocking being put through death traps while they bob their heads to the music.  What I love about the music is that not a single song is even in Japanese. Each one is fairly well spoken Engrish which may be a reference to how Panty and Stocking at times speak.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nPanty and Stocking would be nothing without it's outrageous characters. Panty is the oldest of the two and is a violent, underwear gun totting, nymphomaniac, who says \"fuck\" at least three times per episode. There's also Stocking who is a gothic lolita who adores sweets and has magical socks that turn into katanas. \\n\r\nThe supporting characters involve Gaterbelt (who appropriately wears a garter belt). He's a black, afro priest, who also happens to be a pedophile. Chuck is practically Gir on more drugs and Brief is the awkward, Panty obsessed loser. Then there's Scanty and Kneesocks who play as evil but more well mannered counterparts to the angel sisters. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not meant to be looked up to as role models. All the characters are mainly composed of flaws and that's what keeps them interesting. What I love about Panty and Stocking is that they are practically mock the moe-moe-kawaii desu-oops my underwear's showing for the twentieth time-characters. They aren't meant to be super cute or moe and that's what makes them likeable. They aren't tsuderes or the overly clumsy girl, they're them. You can't label these girls under a specific stereotype. If you do, I would surely love to know how in the world it was possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe only downside to the characters is that they never develop. I guess this is supposed to be a part of it's comedy but it's a bit of a downer to see the characters start and finish the way they always were. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nBoy does this show entertain you. There's always a plethora of dirty joke after dirty joke for the viewers and the action is fairly generous and well animated. Unlike High School of The Dead or Rosario Vampire, Panty and Stocking doesn't need to give you handfuls of fanservice every five seconds to keep you watching. They use their crude sense of humor to carry on the plot. The jokes do get overwhelming though and I did at times wish for a joke that wasn't filled with innuendos and swears. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nA great anime series for anybody looking for something fun, raunchy, and different to watch. If you want to find an anime filled with cute, fapable characters, with all the waifu material in the world, you're looking for the wrong show. \\n",

            "content": "Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt had to be one of the most enjoyable, unique anime I have stumbled upon. However it is not for the easily disturbed conservative. To me it most resembles a more adult humored version of the Powerpuff Girls and the random scattered nature of Fooly Cooly. It pushes the boundaries towards hentai without any nudity or sex actually shown. The stories are short, two 10 minute chapters in each episode. Everyone one of them had me laughing at some point from the exaggerated reactions and ridiculous stories. Some moments had me awkwardly uncomfortable that I could watch such perverted humor andstill find it funny, but I even enjoyed those moments. The last episode left me hanging and I can't wait for another season (assuming what the cliffhanger it ended with was leading to another season)\\n\\n\r\nThe style is a unique comic book style, again that I can only relate to the Powerpuff Girls. It was simple, unlike the usual detailed style of anime, but was visually fun with hugely exaggerated shapes and lines creating detailed chaos as hectic crazy stories unfolded. The soundtrack had some killer tunes that made you want to dance and feel bad ass at the same time. The dubbing however, as usual, had chosen the most frustrating of voice actors, I recommend watching the subbed over the dubbed English. They rarely get English voice actors correct in my opinion when it comes to anime so I wasn't expecting anything here.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were wonderfully constructed, Panty the badass slutty angel, Stocking the goth girl with an epic sweet tooth, Garter the black afro priest with a fetish for kink. Stocking's design had to be my favorite, just because I tend to like things on the darker side while I loved Panty's sass. Garter was humorous as a character that was everything he shouldn't be. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a laugh, and can stand overly perverted humor, borderlining on taking it too far and becoming hentai then this anime will do ya just fine.",

Caution: Massive amounts of sexual references in this anime, as well as cursing.\r\nStory: The story is one that is unique from any other, each episode has a different story and the things they come up with always puts me in a surprise!\r\nArt: The art is quite childish, almost reminding me of my childhood show, The Powerpuff Girls. Except, of course, that this anime is absolutely lewd. In a hilarious context! There are scenes here and there with the typical anime drawings, but otherwise, it's mostly drawn like a kid's anime.\r\nSound: Hmm.. Nothing that I can complain about here! The soundtrackis just as good, and makes this anime more better than it already is. The voice actors and voice actresses did an amazing job portraying their characters, without annoying me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are really something different! They are quite realistic, but an EXTREMELY exaggerated realistic. Their personalities are similar to the personalities of people in the US, so then it has a higher chance of relating more with US watchers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This anime was pure joy to watch through each episode, I have to say that I have no regrets at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt is in the end, one that can be deemed a legend.

            "content": "First Impression & Bias:\r\nSo you look at the title and ask what is up with the undergarments? I will say that I find ecchi in bad taste, but if I was looking for something even worst I found it. Disgusting, morally insulting, and cartoonish art. To tell the truth I don't know why I picked this up. However, this show was able amaze me a few times, and its uniqueness for sure caught me for the ride.\r\nExpectation: 4 Bad\r\nEpisode Scores: -,-,-,7,4,4,10,7,6,9,7,4,8,10\r\nActual: 7 (Good)\r\nSo the story has a slut, a sweet loving goth, a homosexual afro-priest, and the first episode has a giant monster composed ofhuman feces. While I was on the verge of vomiting through the first episode, I forced my way through and eventually saw the light. There is nothing truly redeeming about this show, but like taking a shot in the dark it started to find the target. Yes, this show is awesome because it is so bad. Is that possible? There is a point where my disgust boiled right back over into enjoyment; so awkward and horrible that I praised it and enjoyed it for it. Of course, there was plenty of times when it failed to cross the threshold. Yet, as it destroyed my brain more and more the show became better and better.\\n\r\nThe introduction of the twins made this show a lot more bareable in the second half. After witnessing one of the best action scenes I have seen, a whole five minutes of non-stop fighting that matches this shows extreme nature, I was speechless. Yet, they kept reappearing offering a new better dynamic to the show.\\n\r\nThis is a hard show to write for. I don't think there is much that can even compare to the elements of this plot, as it is unique. They touch upon as many subjects as they can: from Transformers to zombies. From losing weight to falling in love. From sperm fighting against tissues to  gambling. Oh there is also a music video in there too. This show is ludicrously random, and will leave you expecting what is coming next. It makes you disgusted, confused, and it almost even made me cry.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\r\nThis show has been the most sporadic of anything I have ever watched. Given me the biggest emotional reactions, a mix of love and hate fused into one show; just as all the others have taken up either one of those sides. While I am neutral there are plenty of people that will praise this as the best, and others the worst. So, which side will you pick dear reader? It is worth a test!\\n",

            "content": "This review may contain foul language!\r\nPanty & Stocking with Garterbelt, or simply PSG. From the very first minute this show strikes you with overwhelming craziness and vulgarity. It's a totally brainless, insane and bizarre comedy without even a single serious moment. The whole show is just one big parody of western animated series like South Park. It will make you giggle over dirty jokes, drop your jaw to over-the-top action scenes and admire its visual madness - well, unless you hate everything insane and lewd.\r\nLet's take a closer look at the show.\r\nStory\r\nPSG is driven by action and humour, so the story doesn't really matter thatmuch here. It's absolutely worthless to look for logic or any common sense in what's happening - you'd better just turn your brains off and follow the bizarre adventures of Anarchy sisters, Panty and Stocking, the two main protagonists of the series. All episodes are full of adrenaline and high-paced action scenes that can easily blow your mind. Though the most of episodes follow the same template and are somewhat repetitive (sisters locate their enemies, fight and eventually defeat them), several eps completely break out of this scheme, like \"We are Angels\" which is more like a music video. Feels refreshing and inventive.\\n\r\nThe humour in the show is represented mostly with lewd jokes about sex, shit, the list goes on (which are actually done excellently and make you laugh your ass off, if you're into that type of humour of course), but there's also a plenty of parodies and references to western culture (especially hollywood cinema and american TV), most of them are done nicely.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nWell, it wouldn't sound like exaggeration to state that PSG has one of the most unique visual styles that any anime ever had. It's very bright, contrast and reminiscent of western animation. At first it can seem pretty offbeat if compared to general anime style, and not very detailed, but it's not hard to get used to it since this kind of animation is very appropriate for the overall feel of PSG.\\n\r\nThe other great thing about art is how they combine absolutely different visual styles in the show. There are several scenes (like renowned Anarchy sisters' transformation sequence, which is amazingly cute and hilarious) and even whole episodes (\"Vomiting Point\") drawn completely dissimilar to the main cartoony style of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for PSG is represented by various styles of dance electronic music like house, techno and breakbeat. And it fits the atmosphere perfectly, helping viewers to feel the extreme pace of the storytelling. Some of songs are pretty memorable and most likely will spin in your mind for long time after you finish watching PSG - for example, famous Anarchy sisters' transformation theme \"Fly Away\", music video score \"D City Rocks\" and lyrically romantic dubstep-influenced track \"Chocolat\".\\n\r\nThe other thing done great is voicing, both original and official english dub. Characters yell like crazy all the time and swear a lot just like some freaks like them should. I personally consider the english dub being somewhat even better than the original dub. The voices of Anarchy sisters sound even more naughty and characters' speech involves even more swearing (\"Repent, motherfuckers!\"), and that's definitely better - hey, it's PSG we're speaking of.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nProbably characters are not the best aspect of PSG -  it's pretty hard to sympathize with any of them because protagonists and antagonists both are mostly depraved freaks, they barely get any development in the series and their behaviour and personalities are quite random. Nevertheless, all the characters really funny and memorable, and that appears to be enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nHard to speak of it clearly, cause this show is very controversial. Of course, PSG is not appropriate for everyone, even more than this - I'm pretty sure the majority of anime watchers wouldn't enjoy it. I can understand those who disliked or even hated the show - there are a plenty of reasons for this, like unappealing art, stupid dirty jokes and nonsense story. But if you're OK with that, PSG will impress you with its freshness and originality, unforgettable visual style, lots of well-made parodies, great sound and mesmerizing action scenes. What's beyond any doubt - there is not a single boring moment in the whole show, and it keeps you entertained till the last minute.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what do I have to say in conclusion? Yes, this show is stupid, yes it lacks common sense big time, its story and characters are not perfect. But you know what? There will hardly ever be another show like PSG - with its striking freshness, amazing action and crazy comics-like feel. So in my opinion it's worth a 8 at least. \\n\r\nAlso, if you enjoyed Dead Leaves or Detroit Metal City - I would strongly recommend you to watch PSG as well, and vice versa.\\n\\n\r\nPlease notify me if there's any mistakes, or leave feedback. Stay cool!",

From the art style to to the music and the writing it's just a wonderful mesh of botheastern and western animation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd give it a 9/10 Kudos Japan.",

This show actually shows quite a bit of origonality in its episode plots, and maintains the theme it establishes in episode 1 thoughout the series only getting better as it progresses.\r\nStory: Panty and Stocking are angles who were kicked out of heaven for bad behavior (you already know this dont you).  That is pretty much the gist of it, but worry not for the overall story is definatly not why you watch this show.  That said each episode maintains its own story well, anddue to the episodes short nature, you are usually droped straight into the action which only ramps up in 10 mintues what most anime fail to do in 23.\\n\\n\r\nArt: At first I was skeptical to call this a real anime, but dont let the art fool you like it fooled me, while it may not appere to be a traditional anime on the outside, the art style they chooce is perfect for the tone they are trying to set thoughout the show.  There are a few moments were the charecters appere to be more traditional anime charecters.  (and those sences will blow your mind...)\\n\\n\r\nSound: From the random noises to the awsome music selection this show keeps up the quality with music to match its other aspects.\\n\\n\r\nCharecters:  Although they are ham handedly charecterized, panty and stocking feel like real charecters with there own personality quirks.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 hands down, go watch and episode and youll see.",

            "content": "Well I may not be the extreme anime expert but one things for sure is that Panty and Stocking is a very solid anime unlike some garbage that floats around now a days......\r\nAnyway I did not expect this animated show to be so enjoyable to actually watch in fact it kills me that some of these reviews are calling it out for its \"bad\" lewd humor.Its none sense and then having the guts to compare it to Family guy and American dad (in my opinion a sad excuse of a adult cartoon) which are no where near as close as to Panty and stockings wayon DELIVERING a joke (lewd humor one too).  \\n\\n\r\nYou cant just say just because the premise of a damn show has a lot of lewd humor which was intended originally is blatantly disgusting and insults you and offends you (seriously... you get offended by a damn show...) is horrible in every way that Family guy is. That is basically putting sexual innuendo shows in a trash bin because it has sexual innuendos. \\n\\n\r\nThere is shows that are good with delivering innuendos and shows that are terrible at it but this show isn't terrible at it. \\n\r\nJust saying if you have a personal preference or hatred towards that form of comedy and you force yourself to watch shows you know your not going to like regardless if its good or not. Then you shouldn't being saying this show sucks because of its form of comedy. Thats like me hating fruits and yet forcing myself to eat fruits and then saying that fruits suck and taste awful and that no one should eat them. (weird analogy)\\n\\n\r\nUnlike family guy, Panty and stocking is a show that doesn't need to rely on its lewd joke delivery every 2 seconds. It makes it a great show to watch and enjoyable for it Parodies, character developments, and just about the premise all around.  \\n\r\nI can say the story was lacking a little and that the premise felt a little rushed at the end.\\n\r\nThe characters are enjoyable and aren't trash or nails on the chalk board. They actually have an interesting design to them that keeps the flow of the anime alive. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave it a solid 9 because it damn well deserves it. if anything it was a enjoyable anime, had a simple plot, and brought something interesting to the table. \\n\\n\r\nI have a point and so does this damn anime, the point is that this anime is great to watch and to say that its dirty side is the reason for it's so called \"failure\" and the fact that it makes jokes because it was meant for that purpose to entertain... and ya it may not entertain some people, but it entertains those whio are willing to enjoy and or watch it and not compare it some trash.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHonestly watch it yourself instead of listening to these garbage reviews that are one sided all the time. I'm sure you will have a better time watching it and gathering your own opinion rather then hearing rambles of people who do nothing more then take a square dump on actually good anime. \\n\\n\r\n~Laundingo\\n",

            "content": "Humans have always tried to use various media to convey and general theme or message towards an audience. Whether that theme or message is true is irrelevant, but what is true is that humans definitely seek to reach a higher understanding with the art it creates. Incomes Gainax, blending stylistic origins to create a show that somehow defies a tradition that has persisted since the beginning of media itself. Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt doesn't try to reach for something higher. It contents itself with the cesspool that is basic entertainment and makes it tolerable, almost numbingly enlightening in the end. In the end, manywould call P&S a satire comedy, and I'm inclined to agree with them on most of the definition. However, unlike Kill la Kill, Trigger's attempt at satire, P&S doesn't become the very tropes it satirizes, and it strikes a healthy balance between the absurdity of the mundane and the comedy of the absurd.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 8/10\\n\r\nThe story of P&S is neither episodic nor chronological, but rather something else entirely. While events of one episode may influence another, some episodes would be considered tragic endings in other shows. Deaths do not matter, as the show moves on with a sort of carefree leisure that is rarely seen of a story. It is as if the story satirizes all other stories with the way it moves so effortlessly forward, looking at possible plot holes with a snicker and walking away without patching it at all. While some would say that this is just bad script writing, the plot holes feel left open with purpose, not just because an overworked script writer said \"Screw it\" and smashed together a couple of plot devices to create a working story. The story is incoherent and random on purpose, and that gives most of the story a sense of freshness and exhilaration, allowing the viewer to focus solely on the art, the sound, and the badassery of the characters. Only at the end does the masterful styles of Gainax writing shine through, while at the same time laughing at themselves for repeating a very significant and memorable trope throughout their other shows. The story of P&S is nothing outstanding, only because it doesn't try to take center stage and let the other elements of the media shine through.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nA beautiful weave of westernized influences and traditional anime styles, P&S combines two worlds that would've never met before, taking the best from both and making an art style that is uniquely Gainax and no one else's. From the animation of the opening to Panty and Stocking's transformations to the art style of episode 5, every moment feels planned out and detailed to perfection. The art in this show is definitely the strongest point, and may also be its most important point, as the wonderful palette and color combinations evoke a sense of brilliance and splendor like nothing else. Every moment is eye candy, and sometimes that is meant more literally than figuratively as we focus on the sweets that Stocking consumes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nOnly slightly lacking behind art, the OST for P&S included the works of TeddyLoid, a wonderfully talented individual within the dance/electronica genre. Even now, Fly Away (Now) still rings in my ears as the beat pulses in the background of extremely auto-tuned vocals, almost a perversion of the normal human voice, but superbly catchy and beautiful in its own right. The opening and ending are among the best I've heard, with the opening taking a different approach by trying to imitate its western counterparts, opting for a shoutout of the titular characters backed by electronica rather than a true OP that most anime enjoy. The ending featuring Aimee B is one of innocence and bliss, almost like a palette cleanser after each beautifully vulgar episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nSince P&S is a satire, it doesn't necessarily follow the rules of normal character progression either. Most of the characters stay generally the same throughout the series, with the main characters Panty and Stocking remaining static in their embodiment of lust and gluttony respectively. It is only at the end that Panty starts to change slightly and act differently towards Briefs, and it is only at the \"ending\" that Stocking shows anything else other than her undying affection for sweets. However static the characters might be, they are still extremely entertaining in their own right, as the characters are instead thrust into different plots and subplots instead of being stuck in a plot and forced to adapt episode after episode. Each episode is like a breath of fresh air with a little of the leftover dinner taste remaining, to remind you that the same old characters you loved are still here, and are still willing to kick anything's ass to get their way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nPanty & Stocking with Garterbelt isn't your standard anime affair. It's like the bastard child of Adult Swim and Trigger, combining the best of both parents while also inheriting some of the worst. Watch P&S if you want a good laugh without having to worry about something of a higher echelon, if you want to throw yourself into a mind-boggling array of colors and electronic beats, if you want to enjoy everything the East and West has to offer without having to choose between them.",

            "content": "Let's play another game of \"You Got It All Wrong,\" shall we? Well, firstly, this wasn't meant to be compared to other anime. Really, the show has a completely different spirit so shut up. Secondly, it's not a parody. It's more of a fusion of ideas, a loveletter to cartoons in general. This is the fusion of The Powerpuff Girls, Ran and Stimpy, also has the spirit of El Superbeasto and also includes some best parts of anime aside from its aesthetics while avoiding its many cliches. This fusion can also be seen in the OST which is eclectic and fully represents the spirit ofthis wild anime. Thirdly, the vulgar humor wasn't supposed to be funny EVERYTIME. They use the same method as El Superbeasto, throwing jokes rapidly until one of them hits and hits hard. This wasn't made because the authors are unfunny (the whole anime would suck otherwise) but more because the authors wanted to create that wild, over-the-top atmosphere that the show has. If a joke doesn't hit, it at least feels weird and doesn't annoy you like those cheap comedians on TV. Fourthly, the fanservice is not intrusive and wasn't supposed to grab your attention all the time. It is here because of the characters themselves. Just lay back and don't bother. You won't notice most of it because of the show's pacing. Maybe you'll even feel sad, heheh! Fifthly, the art style is not bad. In fact, it's extremely detailed and beautiful. It just has this PPG style which is completely alien to Gainax anime as much as Gainax style is completely alien to Western cartoons. It's awesome but not everyone will get its beauty. I completely don't get why. Sixthly, no, this Japanese cartoon doesn't suck because it doesn't have a consistent plot. Come on! It's about two wacky sisters going on adventures. This is a SatAM format. It's completely different. It's about watching bizarre, fun stories, not about going through a plot. And seventhly, you mustn't analyze it. This show is all about fun and adventures. So just relax, take it with an open heart. Don't listen to bad reviews. Don't listen to good reviews. You must FEEL this show. You must UNITE with this show. That means, you must experience it by yourself. You see, when you think it's a bad anime, you'll instantly drop it without giving it any chanse. When you think it's a good anime, you'll overhype it and think that it's the most hilarious thing ever yada-yada-yada and find things that aren't really there.\\n\r\nAll in all, I think this is a great anime that is just unlike anything else, especially for a man who grew up not on Naruto or Eva but on SpongeBob, Kim Possible, Tom and Jerry and many many other gems. This is my favorite anime but it's probably because a have a soft spot for Western cartoons. I just love 'em and if I see that Japanese try to replicate their fun, wild, imaginative spirit just feels my heart with joy. My words to all haters: give it another chanse. Look at it from another angle. It's not just a bunch of juvenile jokes. It's more of an evolution of Western cartoons that touches the ground no other Western adult cartoon did (except Samurai Jack, of course. Good night, sweet prince). That is merging the fun and imagination of children cartoons with adult themes. Hope my review helped you make your decision whether watch this toon or not and maybe soften your opinion about this TV show.",

            "content": "Gurren Lagann and Kill la Kill are undeniably the most famous creations of Hiroyuki Imaishi, but the two of them are topped in terms of sheer batshit insanity by their oft-overlooked middle sibling, Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is very straightforward: two angels known as the Anarchy Sisters are kicked out of Heaven, and must fight their way back by killing Ghosts, supernatural creatures born from the regrets of the deceased. The older Anarchy Sister, Panty, is a blonde whore, who has the ambitious goal of having sex with 1000 men before returning to heaven, while the younger one, Stocking, is a blue andpink-haired goth with a massive sweet tooth. To combat Ghosts, they turn their lingerie into weapons; Panty turns her panties into a pistol, and Stocking turns her stockings into twin katanas. Other characters include Garterbelt, their mission control and stereotypical pedophile priest with a BDSM fetish; Brief, an unlucky high schooler in love with Panty; Chuck, a stuffed animal who exists solely to die; and their rivals, Scanty and Kneesocks, demons who seek to take over the city they reside in. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot is much in the vein of 90's cartoons, in that each episode is made up of 2-3 skits, with little to no continuity in between. The premise itself is mostly an excuse for Panty and Stocking to do badass things, which is by no means a bad thing; the action scenes far outweigh the need for a deep story.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe show from, an aesthetic standpoint is unique; nothing, from the characters to the background, looks like it belongs from an anime. Instead, the show takes cues from 90's cartoons, most notably The Powerpuff Girls. This unique artstyle is extremely satisfying to the eye, and goes hand-in-hand with some incredibly well-done fight scenes. There are some points in the series where the viewer can tell the animators used Flash, but the Western-inspired graphics don't make this a major problem.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nWhile the artstyle is very appealing, the soundtrack is the crown jewel of the series. Every track is frenetic techno, devoted to finding their own perfect-fitting place in the show's fast-paced section. Some highlights include the Anarchy and Demon Sisters' respective themes, \"Fly Away\" and \"I Want You\", \"Corset Theme\", the leitmotif of the eponymous villain, and \"Ghost Town\", a track not heard in the series itself, instead only being released on an extra songs album.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nHere is where the show gets divisive. While the visuals and music are top-notch, the plot pieces are extremely offensives. Panty and Stocking, for lack of a better word, are not good people. They care only for their own interests, and they go through any means necessary to fulfill them. In every nook and cranny is a sexual innuendo, minus the innuendo part. Several beloved franchises, such as Barbie and Transformers, are bastardized to caricatures of themselves. Fortunately, the show is so offensive that, for some people, it becomes hilarious again. The show's episodic nature also adds to its rewatch value.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the subbed version isn't half bad, the dub is what gives Panty & Stocking its own identity. Every sentence is filled with a cluster bomb of profanity, with snark added in for good measure. The voice actors themselves give it their all in playing their characters. Ever wanted to see Christopher Sabat play a black guy? look no further.\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\nWhile the Demons' introduction episode is nothing short of amazing, they kind of bring the show down during its later half. No longer is the show about defeating ghosts, but dealing with their Team Rocket-esque shenanigans, which isn't as entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, while the series gives them equal billing, the story is clearly Panty's in the end, as Stocking is removed late in the series for the sake of Diabolus ex Machina.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not that much of a serious con, the series's obligatory Gainax ending can leave a bad taste in one's mouth. Without spoiling too much, the show sets up the premise of a second season. However, it's left ambiguous whether or not it was supposed to happen, as Imaishi left Gainax months later to form Trigger. Regardless, the show has been stuck in limbo.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nOverall, Panty & Stocking is insanity incarnate. It crosses every line in the book with an extremely crude blend of profanity and sexuality. It's clearly not for everyone, but if you're a fan of Hiroyuki Imaishi, then you'll find that his signature application of craziness, awesomeness, and fanservice shines though most in Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt.",

            "content": "Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt.  Just read the title.  It's not a deep or intellectually stimulating show.  It's mindless comedy and fun.  Thing is, that's just what I love sometimes.  I just let the immature side of me enjoy all the sexual jokes and swearing and I was not disappointed.  Anyways, onto the breakdown of my score.  PSG has somewhat of an overarching story, but it really flourishes with its episodic nature.  So the story is really weak, but still enjoyable, for me, anyway.  I give it a 7.  The art is fantastic.  Honestly,Gainax went ham on this and I love the way it looks.  The colors, the animation, and the cartoon-esque style are all so stimulating and beautiful to look at.  I have to give it a 10.  Speaking of 10s, Teddyloid did an amazing job with the OST for PSG, with its electronic feel.  It's addictive and fits the series overwhelmingly well.  The characters, while not very deep, are extremely fun to watch.  So, I give them a 9 as they are part of what makes PSG PSG, but lack very much development (except for Panty who gets a lot of the spotlight toward the end and the only development that could really be seen at all in the series).  I enjoyed this show a ton.  I turned my brain off and laughed so damn hard while watching it that it's one of the most enjoyable shows I've seen with the only bad episode I can remember being Chuck to the Future (seriously, what the hell was that?).  Grinding all of these scores together into the package known as PSG has me giving it a 9.  It's worth the watch and one of the most enjoyable comedy anime out there as long as you can enjoy the immature humor, references, and mindless fun.",

Two disgraced angels forced to \"community service\" in a city of sinners so that they can get back to heaven. But what was born out of thatsimplicity is something I haven't seen before.\\n\\n\r\nIf you decided to watch it you'll embark on a quest with two fallen angels in a city of sinners in an absurd journey filled with hilarious characters, ludicrous situations , a couple of gratuitous moe-ments, an array of lewd subjects, and satirical depictions ranging from other media to sexual things told through a super stylistic art and dynamic scenes that makes the action sequences pop. *draws breath\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet with its heavy load(tehehehe) of lewd materials, the show successfully managed not to break the hymen of hentai and delivered an orgasmic experience anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAlso the music really fits the whole thing, which is always good.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is what it is. It's completely honest with itself and doesn't try to be more than what it is; a light, lewd, fun, comedy anime full of absurd things. That is why I think this anime is wonderful, because it's different and it's proud of it's uniqueness.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIs it for everyone?\\n\\n\r\nHeeeelll No!!\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it when your family members are around without earphones on?\\n\\n\r\nHeeeelll No!!\\n\\n\r\nIs it good?\\n\\n\r\nHeeeelll Yes!!",

Since I was a fucked up 9 year old, I understood most of the dirty jokes and innuendos made throughout each episode. I've rewatched this anime multiple times in both English and Japanese. In my opinion the English Dub is better than the Sub.\r\nThe soundtracks in this anime is one of the best I've heard aswell. I don't know what it is about the soundtracks but they're just so....catchy....The ending of this anime blew my mind and still blows my mindas the 15 yo I am today, I still can't get over it. But, hey....that's Gainax for you, always coming up with best ways to troll you.\\n\\n\r\nI must say though....this anime I guarantee won't be everyone's cup of tea if they have a more mature sense of humour, they may also be slightly grossed or uncomfortable with some scenes in this anime. Anyways, for those who are debating on whether or not to watch PASWG, beware of the ending 'cause OH BOI! it actually pissed me off.",

They are angels who use their clothing to fend off evil beings.\r\nI thought this anime would have a feminism kind of feel, it didn't take many episodes to prove me wrong. Panty and Stocking say, do, and be whatever they want without giving a crap about what anyone says.\r\nThe art style reminds me of... Dead Leaves and Afro Samurai. There is also a Dexter Laboratory/Power Puff girls feel in the artwork (but that'sjust me). One thing I did notice is that Gainax wasn't that smart with censorship at some scenes. There were some scenes with a beam of light magically popped out and it was just a little frustrating trying to figure out what was going on. There were other times when they played the censorship card in a smart way (I wont explain just watch). With all the vulgar humor coming around every minute or so, you'll eventually forget about the explicit scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe only two characters I'll mention are of course, Panty and Stocking. Panty is quite the interesting character she enjoys sex and her clothing turns into a gun. Unlike Stocking, she enjoys external pleasure. Stocking however, enjoys alone time eating sweets as she scolds her sister's actions throughout most of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIt is hard to decide the underlying message(s) of this show. If there is one I would mention it's that your first time with your partner should be a special moment (It's hard to pick up but watch the anime with a keen eye and clear mind).\\n\\n\r\nIf you like vulgar humor, girls that use clothing to fend off evil, and\\n\r\nunique art style to an anime then this anime is for you.

            "content": "Panty and Stocking: With Garter-Belt (or PSG for short) is quite possibly the worse anime of all time, and I\u2019ll explain why. \r\nSeemingly in accordance with Gainax tradition, PSG contains many deep themes of religion, sin, and the struggle between morality and evil. However, it lacks angelic mechs and forehead-limbs. And unlike another religion-themed Gainax title, this show is disappointingly shallow and paralyzingly uncreative. It is pretty much the Japanese equivalent of South Park. (indeed, one segment of the show is done in a \u201cSouth Park\u201d animation style) With sex-jokes, racism, swearing, and more fan-service and innuendo than some hentai titles all throughout the show,PSG is as unmodest as it is bad. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, PSG had potential, lots of it, but the way PSG's creators put (or rather, threw) things togeather fail horribly. I forget where I read it, but I once saw something that claimed PSG\u2019s creators were often drunk or getting drunk during the show\u2019s production. Now, I don\u2019t know if this is true or not, and I kind of doubt they were intoxicated ALL the time, but after watching a few episodes of PSG on the internet, I could see the creators being under the influence of some kind of drug at one point during this show\u2019s creation. And really I only watched one episode. That was all I could muster. Anything else and I think my face would have exploded after turned redder than Scanty's skin. \\n\\n\r\nI have to give one thing to Panty and Stocking: it has quite an awesome Original Sound-Track (OST), which consists mainly of techno and dance music, as well as some pop-rockish stuff. The songs play at various points throughout the show to increase the impact of the scene. PSG's sound-track it one of its few redeeming features.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I gleaned from this show was probably the only truly thought-provoking theme of the show, and that is the division between East and West. \\n\\n\r\nTraditional Japanese animation won\u2019t be found in this show, because PSG looks something like a combination of two American cartoons: Invader Zim and The Power-Puff Girls. This is the struggle between Eastern animation and Western animation. Panty, a bona-fide WASP in a red dress and high-heels loves sex and has the dirtiest mouth this side of the Pacific Ocean. Plus she is proud of it and doesn't hide this fact. If anything, she goes out of her way to let people know just how raunchy she is. \\n\\n\r\nPanty is a stereotype of the West, while the relatively quiet and much more modest Stocking represents the East. Stocking's gothic/lolita attire is also a theme of East-Asian, or more specifically, Japanese culture, as such garb is popular among cosplayers of all sorts.\\n\\n\r\nIn that regard, Hiroyuki Imaishi, the \"creator\" of Panty and Stocking had a Panty-like character in his 2002 Title, \u201cMagical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi.\u201d The American, as this guy is called, is a blatant stereotype of Americans. This guy is on screen for less than a minute, but he\u2019s by far my favorite character in the show. Due to his brand of humor being jam-packed into >60 seconds, it is so much funnier than the humor of PSG, which overdoes its crude humor by shoving it down your throat every single damn episode. Panty is funny for about a minute, then becomes overplayed, drawn-out, and forced.\\n\\n\r\nThe f**king American was a lot f**king funnier. F**k yeah! \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Panty and Stocking with Garter-Belt has more cons than pros. It\u2019s few redeeming features are ok in their own regard, but them being stuck in a crap show like this hinders their impact. Only watch this show if you don't mind losing a few I.Q. points, or your virginity for that matter. \\n\\n\r\n/end gigantic wall of text review. \\n",

            "content": "I thought this anime was very fun, positive, and a wonderful thing to watch to lift your spirits after an eight hour shift at work.\r\nThe storyline reminded me of a typical American cartoon that I would watch as a child. In general, two fifteen minute novella like episodes tied into one thirty minute actual episode. It was a nice setup, and I found that if I walked away for a second to grab a drink, or answer a phone call, I wouldn't be completely lost and wondering what was going on. Each episode held its own. The relationship between two sisters, angels even, was nothingnear heavenly and I appreciated that the creators made the sisters fight, make up, toss insults, and back each other up. Every time they fought together against the Ghosts, I nearly giggled with delight. And that each Ghost was downright silly was even better. Nothing too serious here. The vomit episode, anyone?\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were amazing. I enjoyed the varying designs and styles of drawing found in each episode, as well as the blowing-up animation of defeated Ghosts. The transitioning from each style was fairly smooth, and it added to the overall appearance of the show. The transformation song of Panty and Stocking reminded me of something I had heard on the radio long ago.\\n\\n\r\nEach character had their own unique story, background, style of dress, and even skin color - ranging from completely normal to abnormal and questionable. I loved it. Panty was a fun-loving slut, Stocking loved sweets, and so on and so forth. The fact that there was a black character, as a main character even, made me very happy. I found that I could relate to each character, at least a little, and grew to love Scanty and Stocking as my favorites. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this. It was a walk in the park compared to all of the other dramatic, feels-inducing anime I've seen lately. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a break from serious life, or just someone looking for some more mature humor without having to be committed to a drawn out storyline.",

            "content": "Right off the bat: this is a very polarizing series. People generally tend to think P&S is either zany and hilarious with a crude but palatable sense of humor, or an incomprehensible jumble of bright colors and jokes written for the lowest of brows. As evidenced by my ratings, I fall into the first category. \r\nTo rate the art style of the series feels a bit insufficient, as there exist at least three separate art styles. The first of which is the Powerpuff Girls-esque style in which most of the series is done an in which body proportions are a bit skewed, another more \"realistic\"style used primarily in the transformation scenes, one which was used exclusively in one episode that reminiscent of \"indie surrealist anime\" (for lack of a better description), and live action (mostly models of ghosts being destroyed). The switch between the visual styles underscores how light hearted and completely not serious the series is, and can almost be seen as a treat. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing, but given that this is a Gainax work, that shouldn't be surprising. Of the more notable musical entries are the transformation scenes with their bass-heavy strip-club air about them, the ending song that is light and much more tame than the rest of the series, and even a slow love song that Stocking delivers. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are certainly colorful, even if they lack depth. The main cast consists of a nymphomaniac with anger issues, a goth with a sweet tooth, a priest with an absurd hairstyle and a share of fetishes, an introverted \"geek\" who allows himself to be strung around by the aforementioned nymphomaniac, and  a mascot character that looks suspiciously like Gir from Invader Zim. Speaking of Invader Zim, references in this series abound from Transformers (an episode that doubled as the Gainax contractual requirement for mecha in a series), Fight Club, Back to the Future, and even Ren and Stimpy.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to relay any major critiques of the series, it's that P&S refused to end properly. Without wishing to spoil anything, the final 3 minutes of the last episode set up another arc and a major plot twist with no intention of actually delving into it (well, perhaps there will be a second season). \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Panty and Stocking with Garderbelt is a series that is best enjoyed for the spectacle that it is. It's not particularly deep and it may be immature, but that's all part of the charm of the series. If nothing else, you won't see anything else like it and should at least give it a shot.",

            "content": "Back when Gainax produced Neon Genesis Evangelion and changed mecha anime history forever, they say the artists were so tired of the gloomy mood they got while working at that (I can feel for them), they decided to went for something fast, funny, and random as hell for their next series. Now Gainax produced Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, changing mecha anime history forever AGAIN, and even though that's certainly not gloomy, and these series were not produced back-to-back, I suppose it was time for yet another bit of fast, funny, and RANDOM AS ALL OF HELL anime from our favourite trolls. Enter Panty & Stocking(with Garterbelt).\\n\\n\r\nThis show, you'll get it by reading all other reviews, is a polarizing one. On a first layer, it's a funny bit of potty comedy that will have you laughing in a very silly way. Watch it from the point of view of someone who feels too adult and mature for this stuff and looks for depth and profound messages (or ecchi moe girls) in anime, and it'll feel like a bunch of bad, unfunny jokes stuck together. But watch it being someone who already went and saw most of what anime has to offer and is getting tired of its clich\u00e9s, and be willing to go beyond the obvious, and you'll find out that it's a series brimming with originality, audacious in giving the middle finger and trolling the hell out of the viewers' expectations and of the rest of the anime industry, fast, well made, chockfull of parodies and cultural references, and ultimately with a powerful moral/political statement to be made (but not in an exceedingly serious way). Oh, and it's got a lot of excellent potty comedy too.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is easily laid down: we got two angel sisters, Panty and Stocking, who instead of being the epitomes of purity are a little on the sinful side. They've been kicked out of Heaven (one has to admit their vices make them not very effective at their jobs) and have to earn their way back in by killing evil spirits. In this task they are assisted by a priest of dubious morals known as Garterbelt and a weird pet who takes on the role of the resident Kenny (that is, he gets inconsequentially killed every now and then), and who they tell me looks like someone from something called \"Invader Zim\". I wouldn't know, never watched that show. But I digress.\\n\\n\r\nPanty and Stocking will fight Ghosts and Demons using the eponymous pieces of underwear as weapons. They will confront spirits who are the manifestation of things like poop, snot, and sperm. They will eat sweets. They will fight between themselves.  They will have sex (not between themselves. Yeah, sorry, guys, I know I just killed your hopes). They will just slack off, sometimes. And in all of this they will manage to look much more real characters than you'd usually get in anime - because they act like real people,  if maybe with some comedic exaggeration, not amorphous, fantasy-fulfilling moeblobs. You want to fap to the 2D image of a pure, chaste girl who will depend entirely on you and do whatever you want her to? \"Screw you,\" says Gainax \"here you get a heroine who can kick your butt multiple times around the Earth and will only care about the size of your junk to decide whether she cares about you or not. Deal with it.\" At which point, the writers put on their sunglasses and drive into the sunset with the sport cars they bought with the income of the mass sellings of alluring Rei Ayanami figurines to ronery otakus, while the \"Trolololo\" song plays in the background.\\n\\n\r\nI think this show is genius. It is for the creativity of very episode: they are all different, even in art style sometimes, and the more different they are, the more I liked them! It is for the very premise and concept. It is for the simple idea that Heaven and Hell represent Order and Chaos... only with Heaven being actually the Chaos side. It is because it's an enormous statement about freedom from social judgement, and boy, do we need some of that! It is because of the ending... no, wait. F**k the ending. Not that. Damn you Gainax. You trolled me again. \\n\\n\r\nStill better than End of Evangelion though.\\n\\n\r\nBut yeah. Not gonna spoil, but it's a bit of a mindscrew (which kind of makes sense since at that point in the series we already got ALL OTHER KINDS OF SCREW HUMANLY CONCEIVABLE). Doesn't ruin the series though, also because of its episodic nature which never really develops a full-fledged plot.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the art is excellent - american style but incredibly detailed and fluid - and the music is friggin' amazing. Obligatory technical note.\\n\\n\r\nWell, if you read my review and thought it raised your interest, go watching P&S nau. If you thought that I was just trying to rationalize and justify with grand words a bunch of potty humour, or worse, if you thought that you don't want to watch a show whose main protagonist is a \"slut\" (don't listen to them, Panty, I love you! Wait, why is there an used condom on your bedside table...?), well, if you thought that, then you'll probably be better off not watching it. All the rest of you, have fun with the most unique anime series of all time.",

But getting away from the critical synopsis if you walking into a show withcharacters named Panty, Stocking and Garterbelt and expect Shakespeare than you really need to adjust your viewing habits. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like potty humor and attractive females that drop into action sequences with guns blaring this is you, if not run run far far away.  Think excel saga meets powerpuff girls vs 1 night in paris and your right about where this anime starts off. Enjoy!",

            "content": "Ladies and Gentlemen let me give you the 411  on one of my favorite anime's. . . . Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt. \r\nNow coming from a women's prospective I find this anime to be orgasmic, why? Well it's simple, because panties and stockings are used as weapons I mean come on, can it get any better then that? \r\nPanty & Stocking with Garterbelt is a must see you will probably pee your pants from laughing so much and most likely get sexually aroused depending on how perverted you are. It's the perfect combination of comedy and flat out  pervertedness. Its basically acouple of explicit  sex/tentacle scenes away form being a hentai.\\n\\n\r\nLets get serious though, Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt reminded me of a grown up version of the Powerpuff Girls. I absolutely loved every second of it. The story mostly revolves around the Anarchy sisters Panty and Stocking. \\n\\n\r\n-Anarchy Panty, the older of the two, is a loud mouthed sex addicted angel. She has low standards in men and is usually unsatisfied after its all said and done. Panty, unlike Stocking, doesn't take her job as a ghost-hunter seriously, she mainly focuses on fulfilling her personal goal of sleeping with one thousand men during her stay on Earth. Panty is able to weaponize not only panties but boxers and briefs into guns. However the power of the weapon for male underwear depends on well. . .you'll figure it out. \\n\\n\r\n-Anarchy Stocking on the other hand, is a some what rude but level-headed and intelligent girl. Stocking enjoys indulging herself in various desserts and sugary food while still managing to stay skinny (she assures all the fat goes towards her breasts). Stocking can weaponize stockings into katanas and she has quite the bondage fetish.\\n\\n\r\nThey were banished from Heaven due to their bad behavior and sent to Daten City, a place located on the edge of Heaven and Earth where their supposed to spend their days hunting down and killing the Ghosts while also collecting Heaven Coins so they can buy their way back into Heaven.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOver all, I loved all the characters and the story line although I have to admit I was a little confused at times (plus the art wasn't exactly the best). I definitely enjoyed the OST and I absolutely adored the voice acting in English and Japanese, well done.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this anime to anyone 18+ or maybe 14+ if you're mature. I only wish there was a  second season, episode 13 was a horrible cliff hanger.",

            "content": "Wow, I ehhhh, don't know where to even begin with this.    This show is one of the best shows I've seen yet worse ones at the same time.    So much to like yet so much to hate.\r\nStory:    The story of Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt is basically about two Angels named Panty and Stocking who go around and destroy ghosts in order to gain Heaven Coins.  Through out the series, the various events happen and the over arcing story is kind of lost but thats fine.    Also, the weapons that the maintwo use are Panty using her panty as a gun, and Stocking using her stockings as a blade.   How silly is that lol.   Aside from that, there is not much else to say about the story itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:    This is one where some will like it or hate it.   The art style is unique to anime IMO, but the art style is very similar to some old cartoons I watched as a kid on cartoonnetwork. There are certain parts where the art takes on a more realistic form and the characters look very nice.    The setting of the show has a very whimsical sort of feel and things have very sharp edges and curvy points.    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:    The music is what kept me going because of how catchy and funky it was.  Just listen to Fly Away from the OST or watch half of the first episode and you will hear it when Panty and Stocking are transforming.    If you like electronic type of style and tracks with good downbeats,then you should like the music here.    Also, there are many songs that are used from other films like Rocky and Space Odyssey 2001 or are very slightly altered to avoid copyright issues.    Strong point for the series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:   This is another part that will make or break the show for people.  The main two characters are basically very very sleazy girls who bang a ton of guys, especially Panty since Stocking has a slight bit better sense of taste and is not as open as Panty is.   They also swear a LOT, and I mean a LOT, and not just things like shit or damn, but like flat out, f bombs and other very suggestive things as well.   To me, it was over the top and got stale, but at times, it was right on and funny.   Still, its not common to hear that sort of language too often.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:    Personally, I kept watching because of the music, the lewd jokes that I could partially relate to, and the outrageousness of the whole show.  There are times where it was annoying and I would skip a bit just to get past an annoying scene or two, but outside of that, it was funny from beginning to the end. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:   If you can handle the very strong coarse language and the overwhelming amount of penis and sex jokes in general, then you should give this a shot.   If anything, watch the first episode and wait til the transformation scene.     And since I rarely rarely consider watching the dub for shows, Ill also add that the dub version of this show, is very well done.    Language seems to be even more over the top, but the voice actors nailed the roles pretty well, even the small characters.",

            "content": "Panty & Stocking is an interesting anime. I found out about it from a GIF of Stocking eating pudding and everyone in a forum raging about it. It looked cool enough and was apparently amazing so I tried it out. This anime is not amazing. I found myself bored more then half the time. It only got better near the end then the ending sort of disappointed me. Here is why.\r\nThe plot is simple. Two fallen angels are given the chance to go back to Heaven by collecting Heaven Coins. These Heaven Coins are retrieved from defeating ghosts that walk the surface. That's pretty muchit. It's one of them monster of the week things going on except more cool. I will not deny it's coolness coz this show is cool. Just not cool enough.\\n\\n\r\nSo the story is shallow and you get really don't anything until the end. However the end plot was kind of WTF?? and didn't make much sense to me. Well it did in the end but you know. Some of the mini plots were cute, some were funny, some were hilarious and some were just boring. It's mainly the two angels just indulging themselves. Story was definitely the weakest point.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was awesome. It was like eye candy!! Soo pretty and everything even though it is comparable to the art style of the Powerpuff Girls. Most of the animation screamed western style with a touch of eastern style. Even so, it was pretty cool. I thought it was beautiful and a nice change from what your typical anime looks like. \\n\\n\r\nSound was even better then the art. Every song was sooo catchy. I LOVE the ending soo much. The OP reminded me of those cartoons you'd watch as a little kid and sing along with cept this time I sang in my head. The transformation theme songs were cool. I liked it..quite a bit :)\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was fine to me. Stocking sounded so cute and Panty sounds just like a stuck up whore. Mind you, she does have her kind moments. I'm not dissing Panty. I like her as much as Stocking. I'm just saying. Brief had an annoying voice which sort of suited his character. So yeah, sound is all good.\\n\\n\r\nHmmm..characters. The characters are shallow. I didn't like them that much even though I found them pretty awesome. Pretty contradictory huh? I think that's just the show. Some bits are awesome, some bits are terrible. Anyways, I would say, one of the best characters would be Chuck. I loved Chuck. At first I found him annoying but I grew to think he was better. Stocking was pretty cool as well. The characters don't have much of a back story. You do get a bit of a back story during the 2nd or 3rd last episodes. No-one's really explained properly and I'm still iffy on a few things.\\n\\n\r\nI got bored. A lot to be honest. I watched through pretty much every episode wondering 'when is it ever gonna become awesome?'. That never really happened. Like I said before, some episodes were great but most were meh. There's a bit of fanservice in here but that doesn't appeal to me. \\n\\n\r\nI believe that this series depended on its 'awesomeness' to get the viewers. It doesn't go into any big details. TTGL was sort of the same (both are made by Gainax) so in a way, I guess I'm not really surprised. I was disappointed in this series. I went in with high expectations and didn't get that much out of it. I guess, if you're gonna watch it, don't do what I did and go in with high expectations. I don't think you can make a good anime based on how 'awesome' it is. Panty & Stocking as not good but it was somewhat entertaining. Just go in with a shallow mind and you should be fine :)",

            "content": "Welp, this is a really hard anime to review as much of it is really dark humor and parodies. It\u2019s sort of like trying to review \u2018South Park\u2019 in that way. People will love it or hate it. I actually might be a mix though of both liking it and hating it strangely enough. It\u2019s not that I really like that type of crude humor that they do, its just\u2026 for some reason I actually like the main characters and how simple they are. I know that is odd for me to say, but this one is one of those anime that is probably bestwatched without thinking to much. For example, their first episode has people being sucked down toilets and the main characters have to fight a large poop monster. It\u2019s just something better left without thinking to much on it. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really simple to talk about as each character is pretty one personality. The first character is Panty. Yes, her name is the same name as the garment that woman wear, and pretty much the aspect that defines her the most. She is a slut to put mildly, sleeping with every man she can get her hands on. Well almost anyone, there is like two male characters she doesn\u2019t touch throughout the show but other then that she has probably slept with them. She just seems to not be able to get enough of it. Her weapon of choice is her Panty/gun named Blacklace which seems to end up in every color but actually black. \\n\\n\r\nThe next character would be Stocking, Panty\u2019s gothic sister. Her main gimmick is being really into sugar treats. I mean really into them to where she will consume a large amount in one sitting. Other then that, the only time she seems to have sexual urges like her sister is when it has something to do with BnS based like being tied up. Where Panty dresses as a high class party girl, Stocking is more into the darker Lolita fashion. Her weapons of choice are her stockings/Katanas Stripe I and Stripe II. \\n\\n\r\nBrief is basically a geeky ghost hunter type guy who seemed to end up following the girls around and \u2018trying\u2019 to help them as they fight the ghosts and demons of that world. He is actually a bit more complex of a character then the other two girls but most of that comes later on in the episodes. Basically the only reason why I think he actually seems to follow the girls around is that he has feelings for Panty though she never looks his direction. I thought of him as the most innocent of any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have Garterbelt, the Anarchy sister\u2019s guardian and a reverend of the church they live in. He\u2026 he makes me really uncomfortable. His characteristics are based off of \u2018Black Dynamite\u2019 I think as he has a large black afro and has dark skin as well as a incredible deep powerful voice. He um\u2026 he likes little boys with his eyes sort of set on Brief for some reason and also seems to have a hobby in being a dominatrix. Ya\u2026 he scares me.\\n\\n\r\nSo for this next character, I have to bring up \u2018Invader Zim\u2019. You remember the little robot named Gir from that show and the dog outfit he would wear. Well, Chuck is pretty much him in this show. He is goofy, a punching bag, and pretty much something to abuse in the show. That\u2019s just his character it seems. Why he doesn\u2019t just end up running off is beyond me.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is really heavy handed on the Parody part of their comedy, especially in the English Version. If you watch any version at all, I would suggest the English one, partly because of the voice actors and partly because the comedy seems to get lost in the Japanese if you don\u2019t know all of there parody stuff. They did take things from both areas, both the east and west but without having the English version of the parody, I didn\u2019t really get it myself. Sometimes the parody is easy to figure out, and sometimes it\u2019s really hidden.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is really jagged and got a style similar to a lot of the stuff we been seeing here in America lately. I don\u2019t really think I saw any character that actually had a rounded shape except for the large afro that Garterbelt has. In fact, everything seems to change shape, style, and sometimes personality depending on the parody they were trying to go for. We can go from a crazy card board cut out look to a black and white episode with normal anime style thrown in for the strip tease transformations that they do. Ya, the transformation into an angel is pretty much them poll dancing.\\n\\n\r\nI love the English voice actors and sound track. Again, this seems to be like Hetalia in that both Japanese and English are good though it\u2019s much easier to get the jokes if you\u2019re watching your native language. I have to say, hearing Vic Mignogna as the boogie ghost Oscar H. Genius is pretty funny as well as hearing both Jamie Marchi and Monica Rial curse every few seconds. I kid you not, they did a awesome job with that and when she first started talking, I was just staring at my screen in shock. Here is a little known fact for those who do not know a lot of voice actors. The voice actor for Garterbelt is Christopher Sabat, and surprisingly he is not black. That might sound racist, but I\u2019m not trying to be. The character seriously sounds like a black man the way they portrayed him and I give Christopher props for being able to pull that off. The opening music is pretty fun with an upbeat sort of rap song though its way to short and just has the person saying the characters names over and over again. The ending song is where my love of the music is. The song is called \u2018Fallen Angel\u2019 and I just fell in love with the soft sad lyrics. I also have a little bit of a love for the transformation song that they use too.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, the ending pretty much throws the whole show into a 180 and actually has a really awesome story at the end. Warning, watch all the way to the end of the last episode and after the credits, there is something special that you may miss if you don\u2019t! It hints of a new season to come (Although I haven\u2019t heard anything about another one coming out).\\n",

            "content": "Fuck it, LET'S ROLL!\r\nSTORY: \"Continuity? Who gives a fuck?!\"\r\nPanty & Stocking w/ Garterbelt or PSG as I would like to call it in the duration of this review, is a show not meant to be taken seriously from the get-go. You can probably already guess it from the title itself. Anyway, to the story - it's pure menace. To sum it all up, it's pretty erotic and gross at the same time. The producers went all out putting into manifestation all the crazies they can come up with, joking about sex and shit, literally. But it all works fine; the result is downright comedy whetheryou laugh it from the Anarchy Sisters' bitchiness or the Western culture references that pop-up once in a while. Scratch that - this show is a pure lashback at everything Western. But perhaps I am still looking for a decent story in this show and by taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture, I can say that its probably the weakest part of the PSG, but don't let that get you a bad impression of what PSG tells; overall, it's funny, it's dark, quite gross and entertaining to watch if you don't mind sheer amount of vulgarity and sex references.\\n\\n\r\nWatch out for that ending though. Obligatory for a Gainax ending, you'll be mind fucked.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: \"Angel bitches are fun.\"\\n\r\nProbably the biggest driving force of the show's comedy and story are its characters. I love Panty's sex-hungry persona and Stocking's somewhat down-to-earth mentality. Either way, these girls are wild, overbearing and entertaining to watch when they blow-up stuff and argue amongst themselves. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters are notable as well; Garterbelt is a black-afro priest who I like for being the straight-man within the girls misadventures. The two demon sisters for being cunning but constantly failing in their plots. Brief was a great male lead and so much so especially in the last episodes. And the bad guy (no, not the ghosts) who I barely give a fuck about until he showed up...\\n\\n\r\nAESTHETICS & AUDIO: \"Holy hell, it's Powerpuff Girls in crack and aphrodisiac!\"\\n\r\nThe one thing that makes PSG distinguishable from the moe-blobs of today is its visual style, and holy shit it's tasteful and simply remarkable. If you've watched a lot of Cartoon Network as a kid, you can probably point out where Gainax took their inspiration from, but then slapped it with all the nitty-gritty of hentai and super sentai explosions. It's not the best visual style of anime I've seen out there, but it's downright memorable and rightfully so. \\n\\n\r\nThe same can be said for the soundtrack. I'm not much of a sound guy but all the music and noises in the show are great and a treat to hear. The songs aren't obviously sung in \"Engrish\" fortunately since they're not awkward to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice acting, I'll just say right off the bat that I'm glad to watch PSG first in full-dub, because if it wasn't I would be able to grasp the overall tone of the show. The voice actors of each respective language did great giving voice and personality to their characters but I just have to applaud the dub for having an awesome set of voice actors and the rich script. You can hate me all you want for saying this, but for an anime like this, it's better suited to watch it in English since, in my opinion, feels natural considering the visual style. \\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: \"Fuckin' A!\"\\n\r\nPanty & Stocking w/ Garterbelt sticks out like a sore thumb from all the anime I've watched thus far, and for good reasons. The wacky story, zany characters, and unconventional visual style makes PSG a must watch. Things to consider though are the vulgarity, over-the-top antics, unserious story and even the overall look. The appeal of PSG may not apply to all. but in my experience it was one hell of a show. Now, if they'd delivered in there promise of giving us a second season, I'd go all out for this show. C'mon Gainax!",

            "content": "Panty: Being a bitch is about living freely. Nothing holds a bitch down - nothing can. \r\nAfter my first viewing of Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt - which was during my high school years - my impression was: it looks like a show that I'd watch during a 1990's/early 2000's Cartoon Network Block but feels like a show I'd watch during late night block of Comedy Central or Adult Swim. Due to that impression, I tended to devalue everything about the show. Panty and Stocking were two simple minded characters interested in nothing but sex and sweets respectively. Garterbelt taken fused from the blaxploitation filmsof the 1970s and the head honcho of Charlie's Angels slathered with sexual fetishes that I'm not talking about. And Chuck the punching bag. I'm writing this review because I had to reassess my thoughts on this show after a second viewing. Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt comes off as style over substance but that style is grounded with a very simple but effective thematic foundation. Naysayers, I ask you, what are Panty and Stockings last names...Anarchy. Break anarchy into its root words - a(n): not, without / arch: first, to rule - and you get without rulers. Now what does that imply within context of the show. Doing what every the fuck you want without fear of the consequences from preconceived notions/symbols/figures of authority. This point cemented in my mind when a pair of antagonists ask (I'm paraphrasing) if they have any rules or codes of conduct they follow, Panty replies: \"You idiot. 'Rules' exist to be broken\" This quote sums up what this show strives for and successfully obtains. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe preconceived notion is that Panty, Stocking, and other recurring characters are one note characters that lack depth; I disagree for two reasons. The first reason, Panty and Stocking are static characters; meaning that they will have the same personality from start to finish. And outside of certain regressions and reconstructions, the duo you see is what you get and that's not a bad thing. Because their ideology of anarchy is the catalyst for other character's growth. The easiest example I have to back up this claim are the daemon sisters, Scanty and Kneesocks. When first introduced, they are the anarchy sister's polar opposites with their strict self-discipline, a code of conduct, and polite public personas. But after their first battle we start to see them absorb a bit from Panty and Stocking's ideology and set traps, frame, cheat, and generally ignore the rules they held in high standard, all in an attempt to achieve their goals. They fail of course but I thought it was interesting that the protagonists forced the antagonists to grow. You see smaller but similar developments in Brief, Chuck, and Gaterbelt around the time of the final episodes. If it wasn't for the Anarchy sisters the others wouldn't grow and the show would amount to what many people already criticize it for boring/pointless.\\n\\n\r\nThe second reason: we observe static personalities in extreme situations which allows us to see glimpses of hidden depths. After the routine the show has lulled us into we see Panty and Stocking, two badass angels who don't break a sweat when it comes to physical combat, fall into vulnerable positions that challenge them on a individual level and their place in the world. The particular challenge that Stocking faces deals with love and we see what she's willing to sacrifice in order to pursue it; which might surprise you since the show does portrayed her in a self-absorbed, selfish, hedonistic light. Panty goes through her own struggle and we even see a small glimpse of how she'd act if her personality did a complete 360. I argue that these struggles are connected with the anarchy theme stated earlier. These women do whatever they want no matter what the consequences will be and when pushed to the logical conclusion they can be very courageous as individuals and heroines. We see other recurring character go through their own smaller struggles at least once and those struggles wouldn't be as impactful if their development was in tandem with the story. What I'm trying to say is static personalities are just as good if they fit the story your trying to tell, and they fit for what this show is trying to do. Two bad ass angels breaking the rules and doing whatever they want. \\n\\n\r\nVisually, the show is just as chaotic as the ideology the sisters represent. Along with the hard-line 2D visual style popular in many 90's cartoon network shows you'll get visual styles ripped straight from from other well known properties (South Park and Transformers for example), a realistic style, a chibi style, a fan service empathizing style, CGI, you understand my point. And this show is so energetic that multiple styles may be used during a episode. At times, it feels like all these shifts wouldn't make a cohesive package but the crazy part is that they fit with the thematic core; 'Rules are made to be broken.' Art style can shift if it fits the artistic vision. If this was a average anime I'm unsure it would fit but this isn't an average anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe music, man this music... I'd unironically recommend this music to friends; The music is that catchy. I want to dance every time I hear my favorite tracks. But the stipulation I put with this great music is that even the calmer tracks (Chocolat and Beverly Hills Cock Part 2 for example) are energetic and if you expect this show to have moments of peace to level out the excitement you will be disappointed. This show is not calm period.  \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: To say this show is polarizing is an understatement. And the reason (I think) that is, is because  some people have certain exceptions when viewing anime and this show will break those expectations. I think if view this show with the mindset of anarchy you'll come to appreciate it even if you don't think its a masterpiece. \\n",

            "content": "Panty and Stocking wins the award for most unique anime I have ever seen. It takes on animation rivaling that of the Powerpuff Girls, it has mad cool techno beats, it is outrageously perverse, even more so than South Park or Family guy, and its script style feels more like a cartoon than an anime. However, just because its so unique, doesn't mean I thought it was wondrous. \r\nMy first complaint is that the humor isn't really all that funny. Directed towards teens most likely, the jokes of Panty and Stocking boil down to poop jokes, sex jokes, fat jokes, and other such jokes. Myselfbeing a teenager who laughs at such jokes all the time, I strangely didn't find the humor in Panty and Stocking to be that funny. I believe the reason is that there's no subtlety in the jokes. They're all blunt and in your face. While cryptic sex jokes from other franchises can make me crack up laughing, most of the sex jokes in this anime just left me wide jawed thinking \"wow\". However, thats not to say none of the humor in this anime is funny. I thought many things were funny, like the Objection! lawyer monkey, the reference to Transformers, and the episodic explosion of a real life clay sculpture of the monsters killed in the anime. There's lots of good humor in this anime, its just coupled with blatant out there jokes.\\n\\n\r\nMy second problem is the characters. I love character development in my anime, particularly of the backstories of characters. I especially love it when these backstories reveal beautifully why certain characters behave the way they do. There is no such thing in Panty and Stocking. Panty is a slut who thirsts for sex for some unknown reason. Stocking has a love of sweets and has a thing for smelly, fat old men for some unknown reason. These two are chosen to destroy the monsters and whatnot for some unknown reason. Considering how shallow the plot already is, it amazes me how little is actually explained. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the final thing I dislike about this anime is its episodic plot. Panty and Stocking feels more like a cartoon because every episode's plot ends inside that episode. In other words I could easily watch only a fraction of the total episodes and not have a problem. The opposite of this is strictly linear anime which has a core plot that is divided unto the episodes of the anime. The latter option generally gives deeper plot in anime and more desire to want to watch the next episode. With Panty and Stocking, upon finishing an episode, I rarely had very much desire to watch the next episode, and that partially is because the plot in the episode I just watched was over already. \\n\\n\r\nThese complaints really don't matter, however, because that's not the kind of anime Panty and Stocking is. P&S is an experiment, completely out of the norm for anime. It does what it likes how it wants to and that is perfectly fine. I enjoyed watching P&S. I didn't get the same kind of entertainment that I usually expect from anime, but instead got something completely out of my comfort box. I am looking forward to the second season; I just wish they wouldn't be so out there with their obscene jokes.",

I have the feeling that this was something America threw out after it was rejected and Japan inherited it. It's got that kind of terrible American animation feel to it (no offense).\r\nBut I cannot say that this is entirely retarded (again, no offense). Watching these 13 episodes made me realize something that I have not thought about: Is this really how I waste my time? I mean, seriously now. 24 minutes times 13 episodes makes a total of 5 hours and 12 minutes more or less. Withthat time one can probably do something constructive at least. If not, then maybe something that is educational or emotionally intriguing. This is, for lack of a better word, pointless. If not pointless, then this is just fuel to the stereotyping of the Japanese anime. But I'm not writing this for stereotyping awareness or something like that. I am just pointing out that simply this series made me question procrastination. And I am thankful for that.\\n\\n\r\nBut overall, I don't want to watch anymore of this style of anime; it's simply mindless orgies of insanity.",

Also Fallen Angel was done buy a 100% English vocalist. Which i also thought was funny mainly beside Evangelion 2.0 i never heard a English vocalist in a anime OST.\\n\r\n-I own Higurshi, Black Lagoon, Ninja nonsense, Azmanga Daioh and i have rewatch all of them more then 5 times. P&SwG has about as mush replay value as all the other animes i own...  And YES i buy DVD's unlike most people and i will buy this if a Dub comes out for it.\\n\r\n-Some people say the endings crap but if anyone actually payed attention to the ending it said on a black screen \"TO BE CONTINUED\" So in other word it isn't finished there going to be a second season.......UNLESS Gainax is trolling us and there wont be a 2. Also the way season 1 ended wasn't crap anything that has something that you lest expected to happen isn't crap at all... Its just your in ability to coop with anything that actually has a good plot changer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if there is going to be a dub im buying\\n\\n\r\nAlso if people say \"No story No good/To pervy/Not creative/Naruto&Bleach4EVERAAI\" Then they cant tell a good show apart from there ass and there is no salvation for them other then to be cleansed, But people that diseased will always be sick no matter how many times you try to clean them up, you must turn them all in to beautiful ashes to purge the sickness.

            "content": "So let's get this off the bat, this show is flawless in the fact that there is no anime like this out there. It is a hysterical always has you laughing anime. In other words, don't even think when watching this anime, because this show is nothing but hysterical, and such bat shit insane crazy shit happens that well, the writers had to be intoxicated while writing this.\r\nThe story to Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt is barely existent, but the story is thus. You have two angels, Panty, and Stocking. They get kicked out of heaven and in daeten city, they must redeem themselves bykilling evil ghosts. They are coached by the big black funny as shit priest, Garterbelt, who is basically the butler from batman to Panty and Stocking. The plot, although barely existent, is perfect, because i can't do this show justice in words, it's a very, ghost of the week type show, but it's also a comedy, because my god is Panty and Stocking hysterical. Although not everyone has a differnet taste in humor, which is why i rarely review shows like panty and stocking, this one was so different it needed a review. So in short, every episode, Panty and Stocking kill a ghost, and you get to laugh a shit load.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't exactly the high point of this show, because this show is a stab at western audience cartoons, hence why their dog looks like grr from invader zim. the animation looks like an american cartoon, almost boarderline teen titans go animarion. But there are times, mainly when Panty and Stocking go magical girl transformation, they use solid gainax animation, which by the way, gainax is the company that made this beautiful comedy and totally explains why it's so fucking twisted. It has them battling monsters of poop and snot for god sakes. But anyway, back on topic, the animation is what it is, and it totally worked for the look of this show. I would totally say that the animation gainax used for Panty and Stocking worked, because, for how twisted it is, and believe me this is one twisted comedy, I can't see it looking better with any other animation. \\n\\n\r\nIn the sound side of things i gotta say that the soundtrack is different, and pretty good, but it's mainly just background music. However the dub of this show is absolutely brilliant. The anime is a comedy, and it just makes that much more sense to watch the show in dub, as you won't get as high laughs in sub as you will dub. Even a dub hater should watch this in dub, it's just better for this show. Of course after reading this, I'm sure that some idiotic moron will read it and say, \"oh he's not a true anime fan, he watches dub\", which i say, your an idiot.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are easily the best part and where this show shines. Now the show has three main all important characters, all very easy to describe, very easy to grasp. Panty, who for lack of a better word, is a a complete slut, and screws everything in her path and she can transform her pantys into a pistol and that's her main weapon, and she is. Stocking is a sugar obsessed maniac, and will go crazy if her sweet tooth cravings are not satisfied. She also can transform her stockings in to katana blades, as they are her weapon. Garterbelt is there to be there coach, and has an fetist for bondage. There's also this dork kid who is obsessed with Panty, but there's not much to say there. There ya go, best comedic cast ever, simple and hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nNow this show is not for everyone, because it is very vulgar and in your face. but if your into that this show is a masterpiece. I, as you can tell, am into that, so i thought it was hysterical and watched it in a day and a half. It is an interesting take as an anime that looks like an american cartoon show, with the vulgarity of South Park. so yeah, if that grabs you, it's a must watch, if not, go somewhere else because that is all this show will offer you. Now to end this review off properly.... REPENT MOTHERFUCKER!!!",

Meet Panty and Stocking, two angels sent down to our world in this odd anime.\r\nPanty and Stocking with Garterbelt may seem like the stupidest thing you will ever watch in your life, but it's actually truly brilliant with it's story. Why? Because it's not meant to please you. It basically says, 'here's what it is, and if you don't like it, get lost.'\r\nThe art, however, seems lacking. Granted I haven't seen a style like this used in an anime, but the art seems like scribbles I draw on my notes in Chemistry class. It's really nothing special inmy eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound would be a better rating, but do to the over amount of cussing, there were numerous bleeps and bloops to censor it. I don't have a problem with cussing, but I hate so many bleeps to cover it up and can't hear most of the sentence.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are not really special either, to be honest. The girls were slutty, and it ruined it. I think that the problem is that there really was no unique-ness now that you think about it.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I didn't enjoy this show.

            "content": "Oh this show. It's shit. But it still isn't the worst anime I have watched.\r\nThe bad. I didn't like the animation style, but seeing as this comes from a company that made series like Kill la Kill and Gurren Laugen, I was extremely disappointed with it. There are a few scenes, the tranformation scenes that you rarely see, were nice, but that doesn't make up for the very minimal effort put into this animation. Their excuse may be a low animation budget, but Kill la Kill, Neon Genesis Evangelion and Gurren Laugen all had low animation budgets, and they are all up there for me.If you read any of my other reviews you'll know that a lot of fan service in a series does bring down the series for me, now if I only find these characters attractive. Fan service can work quite well, look at Queen's Blade it's got enough story that you can look past the nudity and fan service, but Panty and Stocking is a villain of the episode thing without much of a story. A bit of originality on the name part as well. Naming a group of your main characters after undergarments (looking at you DBZ). Another sore part are the jokes, the first few times you get a sexual joke it's kind of funny, but throughout the series it gets less and less funny and pretty much every other joke falls flat on it's face. So what I didn't like was the animation, the lack of story, the overuse of fan service, and unoriginal character naming, oh and unoriginal characters, forgot to mention that. The characters just felt so uninspired and it made me not care as much for them. I generally didn't give a shit about what happened to them at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe good. The soundtrack is actually pretty good, as usual with studio Trigger. But I can't think about anything else.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nAvoid this series if you can. Watch it only so you can argue why it is bad and that's really all. It's uninspired and poorly animated.\\n\\n\r\n4.25/10 (Worse than School Days)",

            "content": "Another review-slash-opinion on quite the oddball here; Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. All I have to say is......the fuck?\r\nOkay, so, story wise, I'd say it's nothing complex at all, so don't expect a riveting story from this one, although who knows, maybe it will be riveting to you. Just saying, it will most likely be more simple compared to other anime out there. For me, I liked it, but other than that, not much going on IMO.\r\nLet's jump to the characters. There is the angel Panty Anarchy, the blonde, ever-so-slutty girl who has an attitude problem and pretty much is like a diva, too fullof herself, who can also turn her panties into a powerful, anti-ghost pistol. Despite that, I still love the hell outta her. Maybe it's because she's blonde and slutty.....anyways, there's also Stocking Anarchy, the goth looking, dark-haired, sugar addicted, and curvier sister, who is less full of herself and bratty like her sister, but still is quite a handful many times. She, of course, uses one of her stockings as a katana. Their caretaker, Garterbelt, is a big, hulking black man priest who has a massive afro, and has a hilariously (IMO) stereotypical holy black man voice (in the English dub, that is). Garterbelt is way more levelheaded than the two angels but of course they always run his patience thin with all the stuff they end up doing. Then there's Brief, a nerdy looking ginger teen who is actually very nice, although is usually the butt of Panty and Stocking's abuse for obvious reasons, but is usually a helpful tag-along for the two. Then there's Chuck, who is basically GIR from Invader Zim only even less intelligent (IMO). Moving onto antagonists, each ghost that the Anarchy sisters have to go up against has their own personality to them, some more civilized than others, some more gross than others. There are also the Demon sisters, which are basically the opposite of Panty and Stocking (as in more polite, calm, composed, and well-mannered), and are constantly going against the two angels. There also other side characters who appear once or whatever (including one very random celebrity \"cameo\").\\n\\n\r\nSound is something I liked a lot. Sound effects were something I didn't care about too much here but the BG music is something I did like a lot. It was all techno and pop-like, or something like that, and seemed to match the show well enough for me. The voices of the characters, though, were fantastic to me, at least for the English dub. Panty sounded just like what I thought she would to me, Stocking sounded fitting to me, Garterbelt's voice, as mentioned before, is hilariously black to me, Brief sounds nerdy and kind, Chuck just sounds stupid (as in he sounds like he is unintelligent), the Demon sisters sound classy, and the ghosts all have distinctive voices to each of them. As for the opening intro, it's short and simple, but very catchy to me, despite the fact it could be annoying to some of y'all.\\n\\n\r\nNow moving onto one of the show's distinctive features; the art style. It looks like a blend of anime mixed with American animation. Characters move in the way similar to an anime but there are many shots that look like Flash animation seen in many American cartoons. There are also many shots that parody movies and other TV shows that change the animation style around. Overall, it is way more cartoony and flashy looking than a usual anime and that may throw some people off but for others, like me, it was a very unique thing for the series to do.\\n\\n\r\nAnother very distinctive thing about this anime is the type of humor it has. It is extremely similar to the adult humor found in many American cartoons such as South Park, Family Guy, and all that, hence adding more \"'Murican\" factor to this show. It is very profane, to the point that I'm not sure if South Park is more profane than it. It also relies heavily on sexual jokes (mainly from Panty, but even then, it is RAMPANT) so that may also be a big turn-off to some of y'all, but for some others (like me), it was gold. There is also a lot of gross humor outside of sex jokes, which may or may not remind you of South Park if you've ever seen it (which I'm sure most of you have). Racist jokes and all that are actually very absent in this show, at least IMO. The humor here is mainly vulgarity mixed in with a lot of gross, mostly sexual humor, which is of course, not for everyone, but if you like this kind of humor, then this anime has quite a lot of potential for you then. Oh, and mixing that with a slapstick style and there yah go, you have the humor of Panty & Stocking.\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict overall is......I loved this anime to death. I am really fond of South Park and Family Guy, so the fact that this show has the same type of humor as both (although more South Park-ish) meant that it was only fitting that this is the anime I enjoy the most out (sorry WataMote, move over). It also has characters that I love because I find them so funny and so unique from one another, even if the majority of them aren't the nicest (minus Brief and maybe Garterbelt). I also am a big fan of sexual stuff, and considering how slutty (especially Panty) the Anarchy sisters are, as well as the Demon sisters, this show did a very good job on turning me on. It also relies heavily on sexual humor so it was a big source of laughs for me as well. However, all this may end up being a huge turn off to y'all, so it's up to you to decide if you want to check this out or not (hell, I originally only wanted to see one episode to see how this one was and I ended up getting hooked to it). I'd say, if you like dirty, overall very vulgar humor reminiscent of South Park, and many other adult American cartoons, along with an interesting spin to the traditional style of anime, maybe you can check this one out, and maybe you'll love it like I did.",

            "content": "Now then here we have it, Panty and stocking an over the top shitter of an anime that constantly forces the same potty jokes over and over, but wait hold on a minute... is that really fair? I have a question, did you enjoy Kill la kill? How about Monogatari? Is it fair that these animes got away with your positive review when in reality they went after the same jokes? Here's what I think if you can take a step back and just don't take the anime seriously and just enjoy the episode by episode basis, you're going to laugh, it is a parodyafter all.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off I'd like to state that this series doesn't deserve a 10 the ending was atrocious, Im just sick of seeing all the butthurt offended people giving a parody a 1. \\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10: It was a pretty simple story and that's not where the anime shines. 2 angels need to kill ghosts to gather heaven coins to get back into heaven. I had the most enjoyment of the story in the middle when their greatest adversary steps in. The ending will disappoint you im afraid, if there was a season 2 it would of been better. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: I am so tired of people that expect traditional Japanese art styles and anything else they won't watch. I personally applaud anime that try to do something different, a bold move that deserves praise. Taking a page out of the book from western cartoons like Power puff girls, and I found it refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nSound 11/10: This is where the anime truly shines with outstanding voice acting keeping the viewer laughing his ass off with the well timed profanity and allowing oneself to really get to know panty and stocking. Then of course this anime has some of the greatest OST's of all time Teddyloid truly outdid himself.  With OST's like Fly away and Fallen Angel I just can't bring myself to agree with someone who watched 3 episodes and gave it a 1 because it offended them. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10: Some people might argue that the characters are one dimensional and lack character development.  This isn't entirely true the last episode does give you a bit of Character development with 2 characters. Yes they are one dimensional... but just as one dimensional as any other character in anime such as monkey d luffy and such. The characters don't take themselves too seriously though and mainly just focus on their own kinks and comedy. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10: I have only one thing to say, if you can't enjoy a simple parody anime that doesn't take itself too seriously and just tries to make you laugh, just... what is wrong with you? I found myself laughing at every single episode.  The Art was refreshing as heck and I thought it was kawai as fuck. You have no soul if you cant enjoy this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10: I can't fathom why anyone would rate below this, and give something like kill la kill a 10.",

My favorite character is probably Stocking, she is a cute, sweet-loving but gothic lolita styled girl, and those type of girls are my favs! (Except for the gothic part, but I don't disrespect goths/punks okay?!) Panty would be a better character if she didn't like sex that much, I would of taken a liking for her. The animation is very original for an anime, and I love that at the end of each episode, there is a real life figurine version of the \"ghost\" that explodes. \r\nSeriously, Idon't understand why you guys hated it so much, just because it included disgusting elements, doesn't mean it can't be a good show to watch!!!",

            "content": "TL;DR (because this review is loooooong): Panty and Stocking is a show that is very very niche, childish, and immature, but it somehow ends up still being a enjoyable comedy with hit and miss moments. Also some fightscenes are really good. I don't know if I can recommend it though.\r\nI haven't rewatched this show in a while, but it's a very memorable experience- Although my impact on the humour might change. I've rewatched an episode or two before writing this review, and from what I've seen, it still stands, although it has gotten a little worse.\r\nPanty & Stocking with Garterbelt is a lot of things-it's a fun deconstruction of anime full of sexual innuendos, great animation, blood-pumping music, funny characters, and quick wittedness. All that, and it's impossible to recommend to any of your friends because of the name and the branding! One of the DVDs came with a \"sanitary tissue box\" in japan, the characters have panties (and stockings) that turn into weapons, one of the episodes is a Saving Private Ryan parody except the soldiers are sperm, and overall there is absolutely no way you can manage to fit this insane rollercoaster ride of what I like to call \"South Park: The Anime\" into a conversation unless somebody else at the table has seen it as well. It also takes place in \"Japamerica\".\\n\\n\r\nI'm not quite sure how this anime came to be exactly, I'm really confused on how somebody could decide on making a show about reject, rebel angels (followed by a completely obvious ripoff of GIR from hot top- I mean, invader zim) exorcising massive demons led by two incestuous sisters who love rules by using their underwear and magic to create machine guns, swords, and pistols, over an artstyle that seems to be parodying The Powerpuff Girls over anything else. It's almost hard to believe what they got past the censors, and I am betting that none of the people who first conceptualized this crazy show was sober.\\n\\n\r\nI have always considered this show an extreme guilty pleasure, only because of the subject matter and the immaturity of 99% of the humour. The show really does not give a crap about what it does, and that is almost to the show's detriment- There is no way I would watch this show with another person, despite how enjoyable it is. It's something you laugh at constantly, but feel ashamed for laughing at it afterwards. For example, the \"transformation\" scenes are an obvious jab at fanservice and classic transformation scenes of the time, but cranked up to 11- the characters are literally on stripper poles performing strip teases as they spout long rambling dialogue about the battle of good and evil in the form of a long poem. But on the other hand, the first time I saw this (after my initial confusion of the random change in art style and completely insane fanservice) I couldn't stop laughing as I totally realized what they were doing and applauded them for somehow getting away with it. That's not to say that the show doesn't have completely badass moments as well- The fightscene in the second half of episode 6 goes on for the entire rest of the episode, and includes riding cars on the sides of buildings, shooting machine guns, sniper rifles, shotugns, and a matrix parody.\\n\\n\r\nBut does it hold up? Are the jokes actually funny and not just childish, and are the characters likable and not putrid?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 4\\n\r\nHonestly, there is next to no story. And actually- when story does appear, it's to the show's detriment. I didn't quite understand why the show took a sudden serious approach near the ending, and it definitely bogged down a up to then good show. There is also an episode earlier on about a possible love interest for stocking- and while it might be satire, I personally think it is the weakest episode in the series. However, the introduction to the characters is good, and the initial story is set up well. Each episode has a defined plot set out beforehand, including the one that is just one background for the entire episode- A parody of \"Filler\" episodes amped to the extreme.\\n\\n\r\nSome episodes just have bad stories too- but it's all personal taste, almost. I'm sure somebody who hasn't seen Saving Private Ryan won't appreciate the previously mentioned sperm episode, and as somebody who never watched transformers as a kid, I could care less about the transformers parody episode.\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely amazing. It's so good.\\n\\n\r\nI think what blows me away the most is the style. I've never seen anything like it, and the animation quality is superb. There's obvious \"tweening\" (probably not the actual term, but for lack of better terms) and animation shortcuts, but it's part of the overly cartoony style. Despite the animation being almost childish, it also is somehow badass. The way the curves flow into sharp points and the way the animation is pulled off during the fightscenes is like eyecandy to watch. Also, whenever a demon is killed, it turns into a clay figure of the monster beautifully (in an awful way) exploding in real life.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some minor flaws here and there, and some scenes that are randomly lower quality for no real reason, but overall, it's a pleasure to look at.\\n\\n\r\nI should note though that during the \"beach\" episode, the quality in animation drops. I highly recommend you just skip it, the jokes aren't that good either honestly.\\n\r\nSOUND: 9\\n\r\nI think this is one of the best soundtracks of any anime. I sometimes introduce it to people without even bringing up the anime, and have gotten a few people to download the soundtracks without even knowing where they come from. Even in the show it's amazing, and wonderfully put into each scene.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are a few that strike me as \"EH\". Especially ones that contain sexual moaning in the actual song. It's cheesy and although it fits the tone of the show, it really doesn't make something good to listen to. Also if you're planning on downloading the OST, you have to carefully pick through it as half the songs are just audiobooks of the characters in japanese.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices are also done well. If you choose the Japanese audio, you get hilarious engrish that almost seems intentional, and if you choose English, you get the most stereotypically black voice actor to portray the loveable child molesting priest, garterbelt.\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8\\n\r\nThe characters are hit and miss, but the ones that work work really well. The main characters of panty and stocking are lovable, but in a way where you hate them too (it's quite hard to explain). The demon sisters, the main villains, are somehow the most likable characters in the show- well thought out and smart, but somehow get foiled every time. The minor characters are the ones that are usually miss- I don't really care for brief, and garterbelt's character is kind of forced.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 6\\n\r\nI have already gone on and on about why this show is good, but let me explain in this section why I think the show is bad, because there is quite a bit to say.\\n\\n\r\nThe easiest thing to say and what this section is mainly about: the jokes sometimes go too far. One distinct example is a beach episode- obviously parodying, well, beach episodes, but it goes on and on to the point where it just becomes a generic, fanservice-filled beach episode itself as well. And while the slapstick humour about sex and toilet humour are excellently (as good as you can get) done most of the time, I find myself at least once an episode going \"ok, I get it, move on.\"\\n\\n\r\nThere actually seems to be whole episodes that I just don't like, another reason why I don't really recommend this anime to people. This anime is literally the definition of \"hit or miss\" to me, but when it's good, it's really good. I generally don't like dirty humour, and I feel like this show is a grab bag of well done bits of it, and lowbrow trash that just embarrasses me while I'm watching it.\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7\\n\r\nFor an anime where I didn't think I would have much to say going in, I can hardly believe this is probably my longest review so far. The content I've written is unusually balanced as well- I give the show overall a 7, but I talk mainly about how good it is and hardly about how bad it is. I feel like there's a certain aura to this show that just draws me to it, whether it be the style, the awful humour, or the weirdness of it all, but I have to admit- It's a pretty \"bad\" show traditionally. A show involving a whore and a candy loving goth fighting demons is a concept I would scoff and make fun of if I heard it on paper, but the way they pull off the satire and core nature of the show makes it \"special\".\\n\\n\r\nA deconstruction on anime and a satire on pretty much everything that exists, Panty and Stocking is an anime that I wouldn't recommend, would recommend, tell you to experience it for yourself, and tell you to steer clear at all times. I find myself constantly forgetting that this show exists, and it's probably for the better considering I find it extremely embarrassing I laughed a lot while first watching it in highschool simply because the humour is SO lowbrow.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, the ending is amazing.",

I\u2019m gonna be honest. I have the mind of a 14 year old, as in all I look for in anime, is swords, explosions and BIG FREAKING BOOBIES! So wouldn\u2019t this show perfectly appeal to me? NOPE. See here's the thing. I\u2019m almost 18 and I still laugh at fucking poop jokes.CAPTAIN UNDERPANTS IS MY HERO! I\u2019m not going to claim to be mature. Sex jokes, action and tities are SUPER COOL! But the thing is.This show has SEX JOKES UP THE ASS!!! This show has so many god damn sex jokes it\u2019s not even funny.\\n\\n\r\nIt was funny for the first two episodes, but after that it just get\u2019s old. I\u2019m not joking when these characters can use fucking profanity on top of fucking profanity. What a bunch of fucking shit fuck! I will admit that I like how chilled out the dialogue is. I mean, obviously in the real world PEOPLE FUCKING CUSS. But, when you do this shit every sentence it almost takes me out of it. But that\u2019s not really much of a problem I have with the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the show is it doesn\u2019t know how to use a different kind of joke limitedly. It would be like if you took tom and jerry, replaced all the slapstick humor and replaced it with sex jokes. And not only that. But MULTIPLY the amount of said joke by 5 AND THAT IS HOW OFTEN YOU SEE THESE JOKES BEING USED. Yea saying some nasty yet funny sex joke IS FUNNY. I mean that\u2019s why the angry video game nerd is funny. But the thing is. HE DOES IT IN LIMITATION. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, this show does for sex jokes what highschool DxD does for fanservice. I\u2019m starting to sound like a broken record. So I\u2019ll give this show a few props. I honestly gotta say, despite this being the worst anime ever segment, This is probably one of the BETTER anime I will review on here. This is a HELL of a lot better than getbackers, pokemon or elfen lied. \\n\\n\r\nSee what this show has that alot of shows I review lack. And that\u2019s effort. The fights in this show are incredible. These are some of the best fights gainax has made since fooly cooly (A much funnier show made by gainax). The fights in this show have some amazing cinematography for a show that looks like the japanese version of fucking south park. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is that, the jokes that are not sex jokes ARE ACTUALLY FUNNY!!! The referential humor in this show is fucking hilarious. The phoenix wright monkey scene made me laugh so hard I was crying. See this show actually can be really funny. And that\u2019s the problem\\n\\n\r\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the sex jokes that flood the show, I would actually love this show. But watching this show ACTUALLY GAVE ME HEADACHES. I\u2019m not joking. I got a headache every time I watched this damn show. It reminded me of the excalabur episodes of soul eater. Both of these gave me headaches. EXCALIBUR EXCALIBUR FROM THE UNITED KING I AM LOOKING FOR HIM I\u2019M GOING TO CALIFORNIA EXCALIBUR EXCALI-Anyways. I think I liked the excalibur episodes form soul eater more. Because despite giving me a massive headace. The type of humor was really unique. Each new excalibur episode innovated from the last one. If you watch the episodes on after the other (WITCH I DON\u2019T RECOMMEND IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR SANITY) All the jokes build off one another making the jokes increasingly funny episode by episode. As they constantly reference jokes from previous episodes that creates a snowball effect. Each joke with these episodes carry on from the last and get funnier with how ridiculus   they turn out. And the gag with excalibur being the strongest weapon but being such an annoying cunt that no one can stand him is unique and hilarious. Panty and stocking isn\u2019t that creative.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I can see why people like this show. I can honestly say despite having the humor of a 14 year old, this show is just not for me. Overall I would give this show a high 3 or a low 4 out of 10. CAN\u2019T ACCEPT I\u2019M NOT ARKADA AND DON\u2019T USE DECIMALS? WELL FUCK YOU!!! Anways please subscribe for more SEXY reviews. This has been your boy mightypie, and as always good night good bye and big balls. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt quickly became one of my favorite animes, as I knew only halfway through the first episode that it had captured my heart in a completely different way than any other anime had. From the very beginning this show will shock you with the amount of gratuitous profanity that comes out of the character's mouths, disgusting topics that often involve bodily functions, and unexpected amount of violence blend to create one of the funniest shows I've seen, and it keeps this momentum all the way through the series easily. \r\n  The first thing that will capture any viewer'sinterest is the absolutely superb art and animation which replicate the style of western cartoons rather than typical anime. Sound effects stylistically appear in literal forms as the words \"BLAM BLAM BLAM\" shoot rhythmically out of Panty's gun with each pull of the trigger. Action, like the writing, is VERY fast paced and the animation style adds to the overwhelming feeling of chaos and insanity during these action segments. When I initially picked this show up, I expected to laugh of course, but I was definitely not expecting to witness such fantastic spectacles of action alongside the crude humour. Additionally, the art style will rarely change and include live action elements and the series also employs a more traditional anime art style while Panty and Stocking get ready to duke it out with one of the various demons. \\n\r\n  The soundtrack for this show is also far better than I had initially expected, with most of the songs feeling very funky, fun, and clubby. When this show wants you to get excited, the music that kicks in always gets your blood pumping as you try to keep up with the insanely fast paced action! I quickly made sure to download this OST after I finished the series, and most of the music makes for perfect party songs. \\n\r\n  Both Panty and Stocking are extremely well written characters, and are never caught without a one-liner ready. And no matter how many swears they spurt at eachother or how many times you see Panty getting laid, they both remain very likable characters! Every episode is insanely fast paced which keeps you entertained the entire time and the 20 minute long episodes just completely blast by! Before you know it, it will be over and you'll be anxiously hoping for a second season! This show is purposefully crude and offensive, and if that's alright with you, I can not recommend it enough!",

            "content": "\u2018Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt\u2019 is an acclaimed anime series from everyone\u2019s favorite \u201cCrAzY Uncle\u201d that is studio Gainax. As such, in traditional Gainax fashion, it is a very polarizing anime. On the one hand, it, hypothetically, brings to the family table some snippets of interesting themes such as friendship, the value of modesty and humility, and the internet\u2019s favorite feministic ideals of women rising up above social constraints to live life as they see fit. \r\nOn the other hand, it slathers and drowns it all with a healthy dose of extreme, sexual \u201chilarity\u201d (ranging from tentacle rape to hardcore BDSM to pedophilia) with afew sprinkles of toilet humor and a big ol\u2019 mug of high-octane action and slap-stick comedy to help gulp it all down. PSG boils down all of its substance and wears it proudly on its sleeve, withholding nothing \u201c2deep4u\u201d from the viewer all through its 12 episode runtime. As such, it should be easy for everyone to decide if this simpleminded show is right for them, but if you\u2019re still undecided, I will gladly do my best to educate you on this eye-catching Gainax creation.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\n\tThe story of PSG is but a simple premise. In Daten City, the city that exists somewhere between Heaven and Hell, evil creatures known only as \u2018Ghosts\u2019 have begun to emerge from the shadows to fuck shit up and give zero fucks about it. Only our heroes, the fallen angels Panty and Stocking, can stop them. And they WILL stop them, because, if they ever hope to make it back to Heaven, they must collect an appropriate amount of lootable Heaven Coins and fill a stringent quota of dick jokes all in preparation for the day of their ascension back into Paradise. If this isn\u2019t your first ever flirtation with television shows, you might begin hearing the warning sirens of \u201cEpisodic Structure\u201d ringing in your brain, and you would be right. \\n\\n\r\nOnce the premise is established within the first ten or so minutes of episode 1, you can safely rest easy as you won\u2019t be expected to pay any attention to plot or continuity until about episode 12. Instead, just turn off your brain and watch these anime girls fight off some of the most blas\u00e9 foes on this side of anime. To Gainax\u2019s credit, they did at least try to give these abominations some character. For example, one of the Ghosts is born off a dead plumber whose rage intensified into a deep desire to cover Daten City in the shit that likely enveloped him on his death bed.\\n\\n\r\nAnother Ghost is born off a legion of sperm whose jealousy for developing embryos and hatred of spunk-filled, discarded tissues gives birth to an unflinching determination to forcefully end all manner of male masturbation. If you fail to be aroused by the genius, subtle, and conservative Pro-Life commentary on display in this episode, then perhaps you are not the target audience of this show. At the very least, don\u2019t expect to walk away thinking of this as any sort of masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, though, story is not what PSG is all about. Despite the fact that the ending turns out to be an ineffective, unfunny, uninteresting, total garbage plot twist that sets up and teases an inexistent sequel without even properly finishing the one, overarching plot this show actually had, nobody really cares how boring I found the story to be in retrospect\u2026not when you\u2019ve got all of these zany characters at least.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\n\tThe characters themselves don\u2019t fare much better than the story, sadly. Each one, while thankfully at least entertaining, is incredibly one-note. Panty Anarchy is the blonde bombshell in the red dress capable of seductively taking off her panties and turning them into a magic gun. Clearly inspired by the character of Lisa from Tommy Wiseau\u2019s Emmy Award-winning drama \u201cThe Room\u201d, Panty is a stock-up, selfish whore with an unquenchable desire to fuck anything that moves. Though the show tries to give Panty\u2019s character another dimension near the end, I found it to be mostly ineffective in its conclusion. When she isn\u2019t banging heaps of dudes behind dumpsters, on park benches, or anywhere else within the clear line of sight of small children, she can be found bitching about her latest sexual partner\u2019s speed/size or bragging about her progress towards her personal 1000 sexual conquests challenge. The bearer of this fascinating conversation is, typically, Panty\u2019s little sister Stocking Anarchy. \\n\\n\r\nStocking is a gothic Lolita with a foul mouth that can only be satiated by a never ending supply of sugary sweets. As such, it is only appropriate that she stars in the one episode dedicated to fat jokes and then gets largely overshadowed by her sister for most of the rest of the show. When she isn\u2019t gorging on expensive confections, she can be found having violent outbursts of sugar withdrawal or contemplating her terrible taste in men as she lazes around on the bed/couch. Also, her stockings can turn into blue, laser swords. Appropriately, for fallen angels, the two girls embody pretty much every one of the 7 Deadly Sins. Likewise, instead of remembering my detailed descriptions of these two vixens, it would be easier to remember Garterbelt\u2019s more succinct interpretation: Fucking Angel Bitches.\\n\\n\r\nGarterbelt is the overseer, taskmaster, and foil to this unlikely duo of heroes. He is big, black, loud, and profane, has a giant afro, and is a \u201cvery religious\u201d priest. While one of the more entertaining characters in the show, Garter has a criminally low amount of screen time and is usually relegated to delivering short speeches during the openings and closings of episodes. The final member of this cozy, little family is Chuck. I have seen reviewers compare him to Gir from \u201cInvader Zim\u201d. Since I haven\u2019t seen that show, I\u2019ll simply describe Chuck as a Frankenstein, corpse dog whose main purpose in this show is to be turned to roadkill by See-Through, the girls\u2019 stylish, pink jeep. Brief, otherwise known as Geek Boy, is the useless, ugly, nerdy male lead and human manifestation of Shinji Ikari\u2019s spunk-filled hand from \u201cEnd of Evangelion\u201d.  He exists solely to make fun of the people that Gainax thinks are watching this show and to be a deus-ex machina plot device for the ending. Aside from the Ghosts, Scanty and Kneesocks are the reoccurring villains of the show, though they quickly become the Pok\u00e9mon equivalent of Jesse and James as they hilariously fail in everything they do. That leaves Corset as the Giovanni equivalent of the show, a villain that appears soo late and is soo unremarkable, that you\u2019ll probably fail to remember anything about him by the time the show is finally over.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation:\\n\\n\r\n\tThere is very little in PSG that resembles an anime art style outside of the few times we see their \u201ctransformation\u201d sequences. Instead, the show is mainly presented in a Western style, typical of Nickelodeon cartoons like the Fairly-Odd Parents and Danny Phantom. Though it isn\u2019t much to look at, Gainax is good at making it ooze with style in a way that overpowers the senses and wins you over to its side. This \u201coozing\u201d, however, comes at a huge budget cost that is very evident after Episode 6. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6, presentation wise, is the highlight of the series. As the angel girls uproot the evil schemes of the demon sisters, a mesmerizing, high-budget action sequence is presented to the viewer as a reward for sticking with the show thus far. After this episode, however, the show starts to show more and more budget constraints as action scenes are reduced, and animation is relegated to mostly very stiff, cardboard-like, and minimal movements. These budget issues are made even more transparent by the confusing inclusion of a recap episode into a twelve episode comedy series with recycled jokes and next to no plot whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nMusically, the show performs fairly well. The electronic rock mixes well with the general attitude and style of the show, often enhancing the craziness of its many scenes. That said I wasn\u2019t a very big fan of the short and weak Opening Theme for PSG. Likewise, the standout song \u201cD City Rock\u201d proved to be somewhat unbearable, especially when the creators decided to dedicate an episode to it. On the positive note, the song \u201cCHOCOLAT\u201d by Mariya Ise (the voice of Stocking) was a nice, melancholy piece that really complemented Stocking\u2019s \u201ctragic\u201d love story in Episode 9. The stand out, of course, would be the ED \u201cFallen Angel\u201d by Aimee B. The song is completely unlike anything else that the soundtrack has to offer, but its sweet melody and possibly backstory explaining video do a lot to make you feel that there might be more to this show than it seems(even if that\u2019s not really the case). It\u2019s a neat illusion and the song is fantastic enough on its own to stand out among the rest of the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\n\tShamefully, I must admit that I am a simple man with very simple tastes. Sexual humor doesn\u2019t offend me like some, and I will happily laugh at it if any amount of effort was put into it. Despite the very obvious missteps and shortcomings of PSG, nothing could stop me from enjoying most of it. Though the ending turned out to be disappointing, most of the self-contained episodes were short enough and had enough substance to warrant sitting through. Despite being complete bitches without so much as a single worthwhile trait, Panty and Stocking are incredibly fun characters to watch on screen. While the humor did occasionally miss its mark, most of its jokes brought out at least a chuckle from me. It isn\u2019t a series that I would recommend anyone to rush out and watch, but if you know that low-brow humor is fine with you and you are in the mood for it, PSG is worth giving a shot.\\n",

            "content": "PSG, Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt, an ominous work of art from studio Gainax, namely the director Imaishi Hiroyuki. \r\nPSG is a western cartoon / toon styled anime about the girls \"Panty\" and \"Stocking\". They are both angels from heaven sent to protect humanity from ghosts, gaining heavenly coins for each ghost they defeat. They are mentored by ex-convict/dealer Garterbelt who more than once points out that their self-centered attitude is horrid. \r\nIndeed, Panty and Stocking both are very unconventional angels bathing in their own greed and thirst for joy. \r\nPSG has quite stereotyped character schemes with oddities mixed in to create controversial characters whilemaintaining satire towards recognizable icons. For the nature of gag series that lives of situational puns and action humour the characters aren't bad, and trust me jokes are the only reason besides fanservice you'll find to watch this, but they do come off bit plain. Overall PSG is rather ironic case. It gives you the feeling of having potential to be great story yet falls short because of it's inherent nature, that is just as it was planned. Quite honestly, angels that use their lingerie as weapons, slutty bitches, masochist priests and sex are pretty much what makes any action sell but PSG also manages to touch quite some interesting questions like sibling relationships, introspection and sexuality (like, every 20 seconds) so it comes to me as shame that the series fell short in that aspect. I mean sure I liked PSG, it was funny and nice watch. But I can also see in my head a lot longer and a lot deeper story with similar characters and setting. \\n\\n\r\nIn other hand being simple, exaggerated and down right dirty is one of the strenghts PSG has. I suppose it comes down to what you are looking for. \\n\\n\r\nArt wise PSG is quite phenomenal. Think of PowerpuffGirls or Dexter in steroids, smoother battle scenes than anything ever made in western animation before Avatar the legend: and interesting use of special effects (such as stopmotion animation and style changes) and you pretty much have the gist of PSG's style. Obviously all of that in the professional level of Gainax. I could debate again that the series would have worked better if it was made in more general anime style the whole time (which I totally stand behind) but as noted before that's up to everyone to decide for themselves. (Those angel transformations though) \\n\r\nMusic wise the series didn't strike me: Nothing major to criticize but neither did anything strike me as special. Arguably the them/tune \"Fly away\" is quite nice but, to be honest, I can't say for sure if my opinion is affected by the fact that I associate it with two hot ladies spinning around pole while stripping down. \\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a show worth a watch, I mean what do you have to lose?",

The animation is pretty good and has imaginative touches, alludes to all sorts of nifty things like the Itano circus or tokusatsu special effects or even the _Karekano_ cutouts, and the stories are funny even if there's nothing profound or worth discussing about them. (Stories can be clever, but not profound; for example, the tissue episode's little WWII subplot had a clever ending.) And as promised by the anibloggers, the demon sisters are very entertaining. I was particularly amused by the great job their seiyuus did. Right up to how Pansuto 'finished', demon sisters remained great, Stocking & her ghost loverwas an effective demi-episode more effective for not at all being what one expected from the established Pansuto formula, still not sure how I feel about the whole BriefsxPanty thing (was the ground prepared well enough? felt a bit out of left field that Panty could reciprocate), but that ending, yeesh. Feels completely half-assed. I'll leave it at an 8 - it still made me laugh more than wince and was interesting throughout.",

            "content": "Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt. Okay, where do I start... This. Show. Is .Weird. And I get it, it's a show that's not to be taken seriously, but then we have to look at it in terms of consistency. This show has great art, great style and the \"meat\" and \"skin\" of the show are both very polished. And it's the spiritual successor and reimagining of \"The Powerpuff Girls\" too. So, what is this show's problem:   \r\n1. Inconsistency, like really, it's sooo inconsistent.    \r\nYou got these 2 main heroines with awesome sexy transformation scenes in high-quality-30-frames-per-second, and they exist literallyfor 6 seconds every episodes. How is this possible? The rest of the episode got drawn into this dumb Western Animation style and i GET IT. It's just absurd how the producers thinking that teasing their viewers is a good idea.   \\n\\n\r\n2. Satire.    \\n\\n\r\nYes, this show is dipped in satirical references throughout its content. I get that it's making fun of everything, but then how can you take it seriously? Like it advertise itself with a childish cartoony looks, but it also include a STRIPING SCENE and OBSCENE language in it. The ending alone had me sleepless for nights! So you're saying this show's purpose is to disrespect its viewers then? You know what, talking about this show reminds me of somebody I had to analyze during this art history class. This guy, oh yeah, this particular guy made me rip off my hairs numerous times.    \\n\\n\r\nMaurizio Cattelan...\\n\\n\r\nYeah\\n\\n\r\nThis guy's name echoes in my worst nightmares. Seriously, what were they thinking putting this guy into the course. Like, even his nickname in the art world says everything about him: \"joker\". This guy thrives on controversy art pieces, and he makes fun of everything. EVERYTHING! Don't believe me ? Ok then let's look at his stuff real quick alright? \\n\\n\r\n\"Him\", a 2001 sculpture that looks like a child kneeling facing away from the viewers. This is one of his tamest creation. Like, when you approach it, it looks like a child right? Well sike, it's actually Adolf Hitler in the front. Shocking, right? Well his whole genius idea is about the discovery of the petite little Hitler and the shock value that comes with it. Don't you think it is a bit too cheap and too easy? Combining the image of a child and Adolf Hitler together, innocence and evil combined, that is. Also the title \"Him\", now this is where i find a lot of problem. \"Him\" is undoubtedly directed towards Hitler, but isn't this humanized him in a way? So by portraying the most evil man in the history of men, and then he decided to call him a person? Why not naming it \"It\" for even more implication? It sounds like Cattelan is contradicting himself here. \\n\\n\r\n\"La Nona Ora\" (1999) is even worse. Like, seriously, look it up. It's literally a sculpture of Pope John Paul the II got hit by A FUCKING METEOR. And AGAIN, the concept is laughably simple, like, i get it, it's religion agains science, but why do you make it so OBVIOUS. Also it disrespects the whole idea of the Pope as the avatar and the representation of god's holiness on Earth. Like, this is \"how to piss off 1.2 billions people 101\" that Cattelan is pulling. And yeah, did i mention that this was auction up to 3 MILLION DOLLARS !?\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, Cattelan is taking everything too far with his art. The guy can't seem to take anything seriously anymore. Like it PISSES ME OFF how contemporary art can make him an established artist just by getting spoon-fed controversial art every year like a blind sheep. That is utterly totally UNACCEPTABLE. Somebody NEEDS to get Cattelan a REALITY CHECK before he goes off and make dumb shallow but controversial stuff AGAIN. I mean art is subjective but come on, you can't just get away with it like that tolls free. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, it's an ok show, 5/10\\n",

            "content": "...I don't even know what's going on anymore. I'm totally re-doing this review because every single point of mine has changed from the first episode...sort of.\r\nStory: This is just so hard to.....grasp. If you read the synopsis, you can see it's a fairly basic plot, but basic doesn't always mean bad, especially when you're watching a comedy. Near the last couple episodes, the plot thickens (in the weirdest of ways), and I can't tell if it's better or worse. There's not much more I can say, to avoid spoilers AND because I'm at a loss for words, so I'll just leave it with this: It'sfreaking weird. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Now at first, I downright hated the art. It's TOO cartoon-ish, the movements are jerk-y and unappealing, but somehow you come to love it. At very few points in the anime, besides when they turn angelic-form which actually looks very nice, the art seems to get a bit more serious, but with same style. There's one particular scene that I think every female who's ever finished the anime remembers specifically, which was impressive and....extremely attractive, showing that the anime COULD look nice, they just didn't want to.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I'll admit, I love the audio. I love, love, love it. The music is all catchy, and I really can't complain about it. It's the type that you immediately want to download, because it's just that catchy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Something I still can agree on is that the characters are less than basic. The two mains, Panty and Stocking (duh), have only to traits: one loves sex, the other loves candy. Besides that, they have nothing but the fact that they're both bitches. And that's not me saying that, the characters (or at least one) themselves admit it and are proud of it! In the last few episodes, Panty gets a bit more of a personality, much needed, but Stocking is left boring and predictable...well...-cough- The only other mentionable character (on the meter of importance) is Brief, also know as Geek Boy. He was the only character that I liked in the beginning and later in the anime...damn....there's more of a reason. \\n\\n\r\nHumor: I know this isn't an actual category, but I feel it should be addressed. It's EXTREMELY controversial because it ranges only between sex jokes and potty humor only. This bothers me because even though I can take a couple innuendos, it's overused, and I can't stand potty jokes, which whole EPISODES are based around, which actually got me a bit sick. You may like it, you may not. I'm kind of in between, but if you get sick at a potty joke, this is NOT your anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: In the end, I almost enjoyed this anime. Gainax knew what they were making and what they were getting into, but you can tell they don't care! So really hating on it and saying it's the most awful thing ever is a waste, because they couldn't care less. I myself am sort of excited for a second season, especially because of...well, you know the ending. You definitely need an open mind when going into this, but I can't say I don't recommend it. To rap it all up: what. \\n\\n",

Their job is to eradicate evil ghosts and each ghost gives them a number of coins. Get enough coins, go back to heaven. Naturally, each episode is about the two angels dealing with a new ghost. Standard stuff, right?\r\nNot really...\r\nThis show is all about violence, foul language and sex. The angels are about the most tough and rough pair of girls you've seen on TV and the humour is about as low-brow as itgets. But that's a big part of why the show works. It is fully commited and takes itself completely serious. And it gets away with it. There is nothing about this show that is half-assed and a good superlative to use would be \"explosive\".\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nice. Generally it follows a very stylized aestetic, but it changes at times and every ghost is actually a real model they blow up. Sounds weird, but it works.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is suitably pumping when it needs to be and works well in other scenes as well, but it's not a soundtrack I would go hunting for.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are simplistic and do not really develop. There are a few exceptions for this near the end of the series, but in general nothing major happens with them. That being said, the angels are tough and independant and their \"no fucks left to give\"-attitude carries a lot of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe blend of crude humour, fast pacing and tough angels makes this a very enjoyable show to watch. There are many WTF-moments and if you like it a bit on the weird and wild you'll surely like it. When it goes over the top it does so for real.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is an adult show that is well worth watching if you want some quick entertainment.",

            "content": "If you are looking for an anime that has the guts to use a different aproach to animation style and uses crude humor (and a ton of it) then look no further.  If you are looking for a show with the comedy of K-ON! or the drama of Clannad then you couldn't have drifted farther away from your destination.  Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt is a roller coaster of spoofs and dirty jokes all for your enjoyment, so with that lets get on with the review!\r\nStory:  Well, to put it plainly, there isn't much of one.  The story is about twoangels, the sex crazed Panty and the sugar addict Stocking, trying to collect an unknown amount of Heaven's coins so that they can return to Heaven.  The story is pretty episodic, there aren't that many connections from episode to episode.  Although, near the end the episodes do seem to connect but only about two of them with a little flashback to previous episodes.  The story is definitely one of Panty & Stocking's weak points, so I'll give it a 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The art is extremely bold.  I haven't seen any anime with its style before (not to say there aren't any, just none that I have ever seen before).  It does remind my of American styled cartoons quite a bit, although no American cartoons that have this kind of humor ever turn out nearly as funny.  There is one episode however where they completely change the animation style, mostly for the purpose of making fun of other styles but I still found the inconsistency to be annoying.  For that inconsistency I can't give this section a 10/10, but it still lands a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Loved the soundtrack.  The intro is only 33 seconds long but it is still good and I really liked the outro.  All of the background music was very good and I found myself downloading the soundtrack after seeing just a few episodes.  For the great background music, intro, and outro, I will give sound a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Well, Panty & Stocking was a strange and fun ride, so it is easy to say that I enjoyed the anime.  However, it wasn't an anime that I could blow through all at once.  I really tried to pace myself a little when watching this anime so that I could spread out the comedy because when there isn't much of a story to follow, it's hard to go through a whole anime in one day.  This has to be one of the only anime with extensive amounts of parody episodes and a filler here and there that I enjoyed.  My enjoyment of the show comes out to a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  When looking at it from an overall perspective, the anime is pretty damn good but if you do not enjoy a great deal of trashy jokes then I would stay away from this anime.  Also, if you watch the first episode and find that you don't like how it is, then I would drop it if I were you because each episode has the same feel to it as the previous one so unless you have a change of heart and suddenly start to like crude jokes, just save your time and drop the anime.  For the amazing music and art, combined with my enjoyment for the show, the overall rating will land at a 9/10",

            "content": "Have I written a review of this anime? I don't know. I am now.\r\nAhh, Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt, the only anime with a half decent english dub. Hopefully some of you may notice me on here by now, if you've read my reviews of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, Kai, Rei, Kira, Death Note and Parasyte -the maxim-. If you haven't already, please check them out, it would really mean a lot to me.\r\nLet's get this review started, shall we?\r\nPanty and Stocking with Garterbelt takes place in a city called Daten City, where two angels have been kicked out of heaven. They need toget things called Heavenly Coins, I think it's one hundred or something, but I can't remember. But, they need a certain amount of coins to get back up into heaven.\\n\\n\r\nPanty and Stocking are harbored by a priest named Garterbelt. Everyone's name in this anime are a piece of clothing. Garterbelt, Panty, Stocking, Brief, Scanty, Kneesocks. You see what's going on here? This should be called...\\n\\n\r\nThe Angels That Are Named After A Piece Of Clothing And Every Other Character Is Also A Piece of Clothing\\n\\n\r\nThat long title. Anyway. Enough with the story, lets go to the part where I always must have a perfection. If the quality, or the animation isn't good enough... I must commit suicide.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Panty and Stocking is quite... uh... it's actually kind of bad. The animation is horrible, the mouths don't quite move with the speech and it's just not timed right. But, the only good thing about the animation is probably the transformation scene. The transformation scene is true anime-style and what every anime should look like. I shouldn't be saying this, because I actually think this is a great anime, I really do, but the animation is just... uh... ehkkk...\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is fairly decent. A lot of the soundtrack has sexual sound effects in them including Pantscada and Schranz Chase. They have sexual sound effects *coughs* probably Panty in them *coughs*. I think that's really all I have to say about the soundtrack. The soundtrack is only one hour long, which is a good amount for a soundtrack of an anime that only has 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSo. It's come to this, huh? The moment of truth, where I reveal my identi- shit. Wrong site. Characters, characters. I've explained this. Every character is mostly named after a piece of clothing. Look at these and tell me they are not clothing. Panty, Stocking, Garterbelt, Brief, Scanty, Kneesocks, Corset... Well, at least the main characters are clothing. I think the ghosts that they kill have normal names. Shit! I forgot to mention! The way Panty and Stocking get heavenly coins is by killing ghosts! Fuck, I would of messed up there. I could scroll up this review and just put it somewhere in there, but I can't be fucked as usual.\\n\\n\r\nBut, the characters are pretty vulgar. They say some pretty messed up shit. Panty and Stocking often swear a lot in the English dub, I think it's like that in the Japanese version, but I'm not sure. I've watched the Japanese version, I like it better than the English dub sometimes, but not all the times. I think the English dub has it's moments and so does the Japanese one.\\n\\n\r\nThis wasn't the greatest anime of all time, but it did get a kick out of me. But, you have to be mad at Gainax for the ending of this anime, if you haven't seen the ending, search it up on YouTube or just watch it. I didn't see it at first, because the credits came along, and I just thought \"Fuck it, credits, nobody watches after them\". Which is partly true. But, other than that, this is probably one of the funniest anime's I have watched so far, I've only watched roughly 10 anime, because I am quite new to anime. I started about a month ago, but I've watched 10 in that time. Or 9.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a 8/10. The anime has its stupid moments, it's no sense moments and its troll moments *coughs* the end *coughs* but, other than that, great anime! I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoys comedy. This is quite the humorous anime, and should get a kick out of ya.\\n\\n\r\n~ D.M",

But, it /is/ supposed to be like American cartoons in the way the episodes are laid out and how it's drawn. The art is quirky and easily recognized. Even people who haven't watched it can recognize the art style. The art style matches well with the series sense of humor and story telling. The characters are all unique and all designed perfectly.I enjoyed every aspect of the show. It was very funny and the characters ever enjoyable. 10/10 would recommend.",

            "content": "TLDR; A show comprised of 30% sugar, 40% poop, 50% underwear, and 45% dick. Does that add up to 100%? No, which doesn't make sense. Like this show.\r\nAnd I love it.\u2028\u2028\r\nStory 7/10\u2028\u2028\r\nA series that follows the typical American cartoon style of episodic plot. Pretty much every episode has the sisters fight a monster, struggle through it, and remain victorious in the end. While it may not seem like a unique premise, the execution of each episode was great. However, in the last two episodes of the show, there was a sudden change of ACTUAL plot. It felt... off and contrived.\r\nObviously, a core component to thisshow is its humor. It's chock full of gross toilet humor and crude dick jokes. Not everybody is going to enjoy that, but hey, I did. It's fun and brainless humor.\\n\r\nOne thing I will say that I enjoyed and felt was unique was the show's message in the end: Who cares if people think of you as \"just a little bitch\"? BE \"just a little bitch\", and be proud of it. The only one who can judge you is you.\\n\r\nOr maybe I was just high (like I'm sure the creators of this show were) and thought of a deeper meaning than the show actually gave. LUL.\u2028\u2028\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 6/10\u2028\u2028\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nice and colorful. I liked how they went for a Powerpuff Girls aesthetic. The occasional flashes of \"traditional anime\" were pretty awesome too. However, I give this a 6 because I felt like the animation was inconsistent. Sometimes it's fluid and awesome, while at other times, it's the same quality you'd get from a Newgrounds flash game.\u2028\u2028\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\n\u2028Ohh yeah. The best thing about this show.\\n\r\nMusic is stellar. The OP and and ED are great, but the best music are the songs that play throughout the show. The soundtrack consists of electronic, D&B, and rock music that keeps the mood exciting and fun. For example, \"Fly Away\", the song that plays when Panty and Stocking do their quintessential pole dance, is one of the many musical gems that MUST be worshipped.\\n\r\nOf course, we can't talk about sound without addressing the show's voice acting. The JPN dub is okay. Panty talks in the typical \"tough yankee\" style, while Stocking speaks in a high pitched, \"himedere\" manner. It's not bad, but it's not great either. It's simply average. However, it was still quite amusing to hear the seiyuus scream \"FAKU\" over and over.\\n\r\nThe ENG dub is what really shines. The VAs actually rewrote a lot of the dialogue in order to make everyone sound as crude and as over the top as possible. You can tell they really had fun with it!\u2028\u2028\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\u2028\\n\\n\r\nMeh. Everyone here is a cliche and trope. Nobody develops as a character at all. Even when Panty seems to show a caring side to Brief, it quickly vanishes. But I think it's fine. Remember, this show isn't something to take seriously.\u2028\u2028\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\u2028\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this show. Far more so than all of the stupidly melodramatic anime that I have seen as of late. Like I said, it's a show that doesn't take itself seriously, and neither should you. It's healthy to turn your brain off once and a while!\u2028\u2028\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\u2028\\n\\n\r\nLook, you're either going to love this show or hate it. Some people will despise its crude humor and lack of common sense. Others, however, will appreciate the mind-numbing fun that is known and Panty and Stocking.\\n\\n\r\nJust don't expect a second season :P",

The Panty&Stocking OST? OMFG PSG OST IT'S JUST THE BEST OST EVER!!!! if you like eletronic music this OST is a perfect OST for you, I donwloaded the full OST on my PC and I want to buy the CD (I plan buy the CD next month) \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWell the characters are just the best thing of all anime, I really like the character personality, like... Panty is a nymphomaniac, Stocking has an addiction in candies,Garterbelt is gay, Brief is shy and Chuck a retarded, the anime don't have chronology but the characters have what a lot of characters of chronology animes don't have... personality\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nHow I said before, the anime has the goal to make you laugh a lot, just it\\n\\n\r\nSo summarizing it's a great comedy anime, you should watch this  \\n\\n",

            "content": "Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt features two angelic sisters: Panty and Stocking, who were kicked from the pearly gates of heaven for being terrible, god-awful people. They are then forced to slay ghosts in a city that lies between heaven and earth to earn heaven coins. Upon reaching enough they will be granted access back into the high heavens.\r\nSide not: I advise that this anime be watched dubbed. The majority of the humor is in the dialogue, and it obviously has a stronger delivery with a voice rather than text.\r\nStory: \r\nWell I more or less covered the overall story in the prologue. Its interested becauseits pits angels as being immoral and indecent, whilst they're nemesis, the Demon sisters, as proper and rule-going. PSG follows a sit-com style show, you dont have to see the previous episode(s) to know whats going and who's who. The actual plot doesnt pick up until much later in the anime, but manages to actual hold strong interest and keeps you wanting to see how it ends.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nNot only is the art style and animation incredibly appealing and smooth, the show switches art styles without warning, often mocking western animations. They spare no expense in this though, and no matter the style that is chosen its manages to catch the viewers eye in every way.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe OST produced by TCY Force and Taku Takahashi is easily one the best sound tracks form any anime. The rave and EDM beats from a variety of producers manage to cover all genres to fit any situation in the anime, be it action, suspense, or even sentimental moment. Every tack in the OST is strong enough to be a hit single. The voice acting is also incredible, bringing in strong talent for every character, as they manage to deliver hilarious lines throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nThe characters of Panty and Stocking are some the most energetic, lively and amusing characters to come from any work of fiction. All of them bring they're own flavor of humor to the screen. There aren't many characters, but everyone gets plenty of screen time and they all have enjoyable moments so you won't be disappointed no matter who your favorite is. The world of PSG truly brings characters to life like no other.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nHaving seen this entire anime 7 or 8 times myself, I can safely call this one of the most enjoyable animes on the planet. Its easy to get into, the characters are always lively, the humor never gets stale, and once you start watching, you feel compelled to finish it to the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nProudly donning a 10/10, Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt continues to charm both new viewers and veterans of the series with its gorgeous art, rocking soundtrack, and side-splitting dialogue. There are very few categories where the anime doesnt go reach a perfect score, but the others easily bring it to a total 10. I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for something charming, hilarious, and just looking for a damn good watch. Warning: this is easy to pick, and very hard to put down.\\n\\n\r\n*Favorite Character:\\n\r\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, this title easily goes to Stocking Anarchy, the younger of the two angelic sisters. Stocking manages to be one of the most adorable characters ever, with her love of sweets causing more harm than good. Her badassery also knows no bounds, being able to take on the most formidable of ghosts and demons. Also bringing a variety of  humor throughout every episode, be it in her cat-fighting with Panty, or stuffing cookies in her face at inappropriate times. Stocking Anarchy is one of, if not my favorite character in all of anime. You go girl",

Overall the story is good, but the artwork could have been better even though IT WAS GOOD. I think that Panty and Stocking should have looked the way they did when they transform through the whole series but it's whatever. As we know this anime is about two angels sent down to earth for \"BAD BEHAVIOR\", and have to defeat ghost on the planet and earn these special coins to get back into heaven or they'll have to face the consequences. I really enjoyed this anime and i wantmore. Hopefully it will have a season 2 like many others hope for. \\n",

            "content": "A story about 2 angels sent from heaven to cleanse the world of ghosts and demons, it certainly takes that feel that it might be story involved, however I found that to be quite the contrary. The series is fun and the music is catchy, but.. It lacks something that I enjoy anime for and that's plot. It's true it does have one, but it's so rushed at the ending, I don't even consider it canon. It's enjoyable in that it's a guilty pleasure based anime, with lots of vulgarity and mature jokes, which are usually hit and miss, and the fan service it offers.I personally didn't mind it, but it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea. So just watch the first episode, and you'll get an idea of how the series rolls till about episode 11 when things actually get serious. Overall I gave it a fair rating just because of it's music and it's high re watch value. Definitely something I'd recommend for a guy friend who likes his fanservice. It's a short series, so it doesn't take long to finish.",

            "content": "GAINAX is like the stoner dude of Japanese anime studios that can do whatever they want and still be considered one of the greatest anime studios and also the most influenced but what if they had influence from the Western World?\r\nThat is where Panty & Stocking w/Garterbelt comes in.\r\nPanty & Stocking w/Garter belt has a lot of Western Animation influence in course of the style of animation (most of the time but sometimes go to its roots), character design and they even went the route of doing 2 11-minute segments in each episode and episode titles reference some Western pop culture property (Transformers, Death Race,Dawn of The Dead, Back to the Future, etc.) Mostly if FLCL had an orgy with Powerpuff Girls, Invader Zim & My Life as a Teenage Robot, this would be its spawn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline in here is that two angels (Panty & Stocking) needs to collect enough Heaven Coins to get back into Heaven with the help of afro-priest Garterbelt by defeating the ghosts in Daten City and they do explode in a cheap Godzilla-esque kind of way. But also happens to get side-tracked by two demon girls Scanty & Knee socks (seen later in the series) and bitchiness does ensue between the two sets of sisters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOther characters include Chuck, the pet that does indeed look like Gir from Invader Zim and yes, I find Chuck annoying as hell and completely useless in this series and Brief, the butt monkey that has a crush of Panty, despite her whoring herself around every guy she finds and bone. Mainly that is Panty\u2019s trait and Stocking\u2026\u2026..is f***ing weird. Her trait is that she wolfs down any sweets she can find but she is the most level-headed sister of the duo (which was needed). Garterbelt is the strangest character in the show and I think they had gotten the whole priest with homosexual tendencies reference.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPSG has a large amount of nonsensical surroundings and it doesn\u2019t take itself that seriously and it can get too crazy\u2026\u2026..and yet it\u2019s an okay show. I am actually glad that it was marketed as not taken too seriously but sometimes some anime that does market itself as a serious anime but when the final product arrives, it fails to do its job, considering I have watched some anime that have f**ked up its premise. But if it has too much nonsense, it will turn off some people and by that, I mean both anime and non-anime fans.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: Out of all the GAINAX shows, FLCL, this is not. Gurren Lagann, not that either but it didn\u2019t turn my brain into fresh-squeezed orange juice like Evangelion. It can turn me on and off at the same time and it did its job to entertain me despite some flaws.  The animation is very daring but also lazy at a few times and I did like the music of the show, especially the ending theme \u201cFallen Angel\u201d and \u201cFly Away\u201d, the insert song where the girls goes into magical girl mode. Unfortunately, some of the characters might get annoying to you like Panty\u2019s a bitch, Stocking\u2019s a sugar crack addict, Garter belt is, well, strange but then again, he is the one to straightened the girls out, I said enough about Chuck but Brief is also as annoying and useless as Chuck but if a Season 2 does get made, I might give that a shot.",

In order to get back in heaven, they have to battle ghosts and earn heaven coins. \r\nArt: 10. PSG is drawn in a style different from most anime. The art resembles an American cartoon in some ways, but a Japanese cartoon in other ways. The animation runs very smoothly, and the colors are very bright.\r\nSound: 10 The voices were a perfect match for the characters. The backround music wasgreat as well. Oh, and the theme song might get stuck in your head, as one of my friends say.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 The characters of PSG are unique and funny. As the series go on, their personalities develop as we learn more about them. For example, the priest Gartebelt seemed to just be there at first. After a few episodes, we learn about his past and he becomes a more important character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10. Definitely a 10. I enjoyed this anime a lot. It was funny, and it's the kind of thing that would offend my parents. I showed PSG to another friend of mine and got him hooked on the show as well! \\n\\n\r\nMy overall score for PSG is 10/10 I would highly recomend this nime to anyone who isn't offended by crude humor.\\n",
