            "content": "Relationships cannot exist without bumps along the road.  There are always conflicting viewpoints between two individuals and it would not be a healthy relationship should both parties agree with each other every single time.\r\nShakugan no Shana III, the long awaited third and final season of Shakugan no Shana, has finally made its way into light.  After a cliffhanger ending from Shakugan no Shana II, SnS III picks up some time after the cliffhanger and presents the audience some shocking details that have the possibility to make or break the conclusion to this beloved anime series.\r\nThe huge shift of Sakai Yuji's disappearance takes atoll on the romantic aspect of the story.  In fact, it runs all through the season.  No mushy lovey-dovey moments between Shana and Yuji that would be expected from the first two seasons.  There are very few \"urasai, urasai, urasai!\" moments and the ones that exist do not resemble those of the previous seasons.  The changes made to the story have deeply changed the relationship between the flame haze and the torch; and to some fans, it may be too much.\\n\\n\r\nNot all is lost with the romance of the story, however; it simply took a different form.  The conflicting views of a new world between Yuji and Shana separate the two, each unable to find a compromise.  Shana yearns to discover Yuji's motives behind his actions while Yuji refrains from spilling the beans, claiming it is for the future of him and Shana.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it sounds like the basis of the story would expand much further, it sadly does not.  Shana having her most important person as an enemy is quite an intriguing situation, but it is crushed by the lack of common sense within the quarrel.  Shana and Yuji go back and forth, with Yuji leaving Shana and the audience in the dark as to what is really going on.  It's a disappointing flaw in the story, as the grounds of the plot had so much more potential to branch out.  Instead, SnS III presents viewers a overly-complicated, unnecessarily dramatic lover's quarrel.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why this story of love is so poorly executed is due to the fact that there is simply too much trying to go on all at once.  There are a significant amount of new supporting characters as well as the return of a majority of the older supporting roles.  Many of these supporting roles have intents that add spin to the already complicated storyline.  There are numerous loose ends in the story, many of which go unsolved at the end.  While the new cast is somewhat appealing, the focus on Shana and Yuji greatly overshadows the new crew which cuts the character development to a \"hey, here's a new character; enjoy!\" kind of deal.\\n\\n\r\nThe older cast proves to have developed more, but the time gap and little explanation other than a few scenes of recap make the changes a little shaky.  Shana herself has become more powerful, able to use her flame haze powers to spawn wings, a giant fiery hand, and other flame tactics.  It is said that Shana went through rigorous training to prepare for the return of the infamous Sakai Yuji.  Speaking of which, Sakai Yuji has taken a new role as a villain, and a trashy one at that.  It seems as if the old, incapable Yuji has grown a pair and comes up with an absurd idea that the world now is not cutting it.  It truly is aggravating to watch these two dispute, and the ulterior motives of Yuji carry many degrees of ignorance.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of SnS III is about as good as SnS I and II.  The visuals and fight scenes (which were severely lackluster compared to Shana I and II) maintained a fluid and clear presentation.  The details such as Shana's flames remain just like they did in the past.  While the art and animation was nice, the big problem with this is that this season did not do a good job on capitalizing it.  The season was dialogue-heavy and the dialogue was painfully boring.  The fight scenes were few and not as suspenseful or long as Shana's previous feats.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these glaring flaws, the music of SnS III does not disappoint.  The excellent performances of Kotoko and Kawada Mami bring some nostalgic feeling to this foreign-feeling season.  The OST remains constant to the previous seasons which still suits the mood well.  The voice actors also brought their A-game this time around, showing a wide array of vocal range to differentiate the huge cast of supporting roles a bit better.\\n\\n\r\nWhile SnS III's score was a delight, it is not something that can save the plot's execution.  The notion of two lovers wanting to be together but holding their own pride between them is a probable situation, but completely irritating the way Shana III went about it.  Throughout the whole season I was questioning the point of Yuji's motives while still holding hope that the explanation would be an acceptable one.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nThe new face of Yuji does not mask the idiocy he already had within him.  The excuse for Shana and Yuji to be together was one that simply could not cut it.\\n\\n\r\nThis final season of Shana III was not a very enjoyable one.  There were too many irritants within the grand scheme of things that distracts from the great Shana fans have come to know and love.  This whole season seemed very foreign when compared  to the first two seasons.  It's as if this season was all a dream.  Many things were lacking or gone while many new things came into play.  It certainly was a new world for Shana and co. and I can't exactly say I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nThe attempt to go very deep into a story was very possible for 24 episodes yet the writers refrained from adding the most crucial step:  an explanation.  Watching Yuji and Shana's plans unfold becomes dull and dry too quickly when viewers are left in the dark.  A similar feeling would be watching a movie in a foreign language with no subtitles or ways to make out what the actors are saying other than through body language.\\n\\n\r\nShakugan no Shana III has finally made its course.  It had a great pile of potential but that pile was sadly trampled on.  Explanations to the vast number of changes could have easily been gifted, but they were held out until the very end.  Shakugan no Shana III had multiple things going for it, but there were too many bumps along the road to bear.",

            "content": "(This is my first review here on MAL, so I apologize for being an amateur at this. Also be aware, minor spoilers are included.)\r\nOh Shana, how low could you have gotten?\r\nI was a big Shana fan three years ago, and after hearing of the news of when season 3 was going to premier last Summer, I was overjoyed. Boy was I in for a surprise, massive disappointment.\r\nShakugan no Shana III (Final) is J.C. Staff's third and final adaption of the popular Shakugan no Shana light novel series written by Yashichiro Takahashi. Shakugan no Shana is a hot series for J.C. Staff, with each volume ofseason 1 and season 2 having sold 10,000+ copies total, and with great reason. Shakugan no Shana was a very entertaining and interesting series with the first two seasons. Season 3 however, is a whole different beast (It's even selling on average 4,000 copies per volume on average, not 10,000+ like the successful first two seasons.).\\n\\n\r\nWe start off with how Yuji has disappeared, and whether or not if he truly has had his flame burn out. This was interesting...for a while. One of the biggest issues early on with season 3 is time. They make no effort to explain when season 3 takes place (I.E. How long after the end of season 2.), and it proves to be a problem that just gets worse, confusing the viewer. Not to mention, something always associated with time, pacing. Shana III has an issue of making events either occur way too fast, or way too slow (Like slower than Dragon Ball Z almost at times.). This is very apparent during much of the first half, the war between the Flame Hazes, and the Bal Masque which also happens to be one of the most boring, if not the most boring war I've ever seen in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with the series is character development, and lack of explanations as to what's going on. Season 3's biggest issue is adding too many characters at once, and then not even bothering to provide any back-story, thus causing the viewer to hardly care about them. They'll only really be attached to the characters they know and love from the first two seasons, except of course Yuji (I'll get to this later.). As the show goes on, this only gets worse and worse as they try to make you care with touching moments, but due to the lack of proper character development, this does nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of explanations really is one of the biggest issues. It makes the show quite confusing, and leads to the viewer being quite bored. There are also many contradictions thanks to this.\\n\\n\r\nNow, Yuji. The Yuji you knew from seasons 1 and 2 is completely gone. For some, this may be a good thing, but for others, it's quite a bad thing. Basically early on he has The Snake of the Festival take over his body. We have no idea where Yuji was, or where The Snake of the Festival came in which goes back to the issue of the lack of explanations and time. The Snake of the Festival later takes over as leader of the Bal Masque (As he was their former boss before he was sealed away.), and his goal first is to free his old body (Which of course, is a giant snake.), and he has another thing up his sleeve (He reveals this during the war.) which I won't post about due to spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art (Well, it's not as good, but it works.) are pretty much on par with the first two seasons, and they're what help hold this show up from being a 3/10 show or lower. It helps make the show still somewhat enjoyable. They're the best things about the show, which is such a shame. The entertainment value is there, but not much. A few episodes I've found have been quite a chore to watch even.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shana III is a massive disappointment, and only devoted Shana fans will really have any reason to watch this, the main one being just to finish the story (This is the only reason why I haven't dropped it, I really want to see the end.). I may edit this after I see the end, but I don't expect this show to get much better.\\n\\n\r\nEdit 3/30/2012 after seeing episodes 23 and 24 (The original part of the review was on 1-22):\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 23 didn't really help the show (It suffered from the same problems that are very apparent in the series), but episode 24 was worth watching (It's pretty much the only episode really worth watching). We get a decent enough ending which actually resulted in some decent character development.",

It appears that the protagonist had reversed and became antagonist. With the briefly explained background information of the first episode, the viewer may have difficulties understanding the reasons behind protagonist's faction change. Although I had hoped for more details in the first episode, I think that it may be best the way it is, that is lackof a complete background introduction. Overall, this animation is enjoyable and exciting, which is true in my case, The art work and sound of S3 quality was specular, I would rate the SNS s3 a 8.5/10.",

Yes, I was waiting the third season very long!\r\nThe third season of Shana - the long-awaited project from J.C.Staff, which was expected not only to fans of the most Shana, but also people who love any art of this studio.\r\nSince I myself am a fan of Shana, I can say that the ending was totally justified. This anime made \u200b\u200bme remember all the seasons of Shana and this is good news, since not every studio can do it.\r\nIn fact, in the third season added a lot of sharp turns of the plot, which is good simple viewiers. (Story - 9)\r\nNew Shana a lot ofinteresting creatures and transformations, that is good news. New monsters, interesting buildings and various specifically can fully appreciate the scale and scope of this anime. (Art - 8)\\n\\n\r\nThe music is just great! Since the release of the anime, and to this day, I listen openings and endings. (Sound - 8)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters not really changed since the second season, of course added new ones, but they are not particularly interesting. An exception can be called Sakai Yuji. (Character - 7)\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately when watching the third season of Shana sometimes there is a desire to switch off and do not watch it, because so much is not clear, but razbratsya in all of this is very difficult, but it's still interesting to know how it ends, and how the story will turn into reality. (Enjoyment - 7)\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I would like to add that all the seasons of Shakugan no Shana made \u200b\u200ba huge impression on me, and so I want to thank J.C.Staff for taking the job. They were able to do Shakugan no Shana for what it is, and a happy ending to it - it's entirely their merit. I'm glad it ended so Shakugan no Shana!\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, not that it matter much.\r\nI address this to fans of the the series,\r\nFirstly, if you enjoyed the first two seasons because of the plot, characters and nice pace, like myself, then you can kiss those things goodbye and prepare yourself for intense confusion.\r\nNow really review this.\r\nTo be completely honest, I've watched few anime with as much of an impact as Shakugan no Shana from the start. I enjoyed the first two seasons as well as the specials thoroughly, I enjoyed the concept of existence and I enjoyed the love elements placed thought out them.\r\nIn the case of Shakugan no ShanaIII Final, it seems to have butchered everything great about the first two seasons. This is because they were replaced them with endless fight scenes and a sudden increase in cast with no backstory whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say the anime itself is bad, but because the first two seasons were incredibly similar, I must say that the change in delivering the story was a little strange. Anyway, I should talk about why this sequel wasn't as good as it could have been.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nAlright, assuming you've watched the first two seasons, you should have a thorough idea of where the plot is at. However, most characters from the past barely have any screen time and those who do hardly need an explanation about themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with a nice plot twist which adds an interesting controversy from the beginning. In truth, the first episode was very similar to the first two seasons. Even the episodes following keep a nice plot going, it didn't take long though for the action to kick in.\\n\\n\r\nThe first two seasons had an equal pace of both action and progressing with the plot and somewhat decent character development. In this case you are introduced to a short and strong plot, before delving into battles that cover endless amounts of episodes. But these scenes are so long that they ignore the plot, heck they could have been condensed into half, no, a quarter of their length really easily.\\n\\n\r\nAlongside these fights you are also introduced to a cast so large that you sometimes forget about the main characters, which isn't a good thing. Though I\u2019ll address this later alongside those damn Flame Hazes.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning of the season was great to be honest, it delivered the plot with a decent pace and flow. After that you\u2019re bombarded with action packed scenes that actually like to avoid the plot. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re bad scenes, but you\u2019ll be so adjusted to the fighting that when the story progresses you\u2019ll be a little caught off.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the plot does develop, there are usually actions that take place that are completely stupid. You will most probably find yourself dumbstruck at how unbelievably crazy the things people do in the season are, however you\u2019ll have to suck it up and remember that whatever happens is never addressed to again.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a necessarily bad story, but the lack of any progression due to the fights causes you to forget the plot. I must say though that a few episodes at the end make a nod or two towards a certain someone from the first episode of the first season which really meant something.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a 5/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nI decided to combine the two since I actually have little to say on the matter for either.\\n\\n\r\nThe art remains similar to it\u2019s prequels, here and there you notice a little more detail than usual but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nThe truly exceptional factor in the art is that no matter how fast paced things get, you\u2019re still supplied with decently fluid animation and detail. Being a twenty-six episode season there are naturally a ton of scenes and a lot that needs to be tended to during those full scale fight scenes with an entire army of people.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this I really admire the people who animated and coloured every scene throughout the season, even the computer generated snow and stuff is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound however... It took a turn for the worst. While the first two seasons gave you soundtracks with emotion, tension and meaning all I heard throughout Final was dramatic music.\\n\\n\r\nThe music wasn\u2019t anything bad, not was it anything superior to the first seasons, however I heard so many pieces for action filled scenes that I swear only ever heard a cycle of five songs or so.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed all of the OP and EDs and found \u2018Light My Fire\u2019 to be a song I really enjoy. No problems there.\\n\\n\r\nTo be truthful, I don\u2019t want to go back through the series either just to try and hear those non-dramatic pieces.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects were the same as ever, satisfying. Not much else to say.\\n\\n\r\nThe art gets a 7/10 for a decent job and consistency on demand.\\n\\n\r\nThe musical score and sounds only get a 5/10 due to playing their part in adding tension but nothing more than that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nOkay, this is where I actually begin to get annoyed since characters that played a role in the first two seasons are barely addressed to again.\\n\\n\r\nKeisaku, Eita? I think I\u2019ve heard those names before... Nope, must have been my imagination.\\n\\n\r\nPast characters who added to the plot barely got a mention during Final, which was sad since I never once disliked the cast at all. While those who did still didn\u2019t get much attention paid either.\\n\\n\r\nIn this case all there is to focus on is Sakai Yuji, Shana and an massive new cast of characters who completely stamped on any understanding you ever had of past members involved with anything at all from the plot before Final.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many new characters which really aggravated me more than anything else. Despite the issues with the plot, despite the endless fighting, the characters are what got me most.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly and fore mostly, don\u2019t bother with remembering their names. Just don\u2019t. Because you\u2019ll not only struggle with comprehending the battles and the plot, but also who you are watching make the plot happen.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is the cast incredibly large and time consuming to remember, but the story flickers between all of them constantly. At a fair few points some die and you\u2019ll either say, \u201cWho was that?\u201d or you\u2019ll forget them in a short time anyway because someone new has probably been introduced by then.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, it seems that we didn\u2019t have to bother with remembering their backstory since it is NEVER explained. Okay, maybe one person had their past told in the most unhelpful way, but constantly shifting between people in the story left it incredibly difficult to keep track of anything!\\n\\n\r\nPersonality wise... You will still be lost as the new characters reveal barely anything about themselves. Leaving you with bland characters who probably can\u2019t make an apocalypse exciting.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love Yuji and Shana however you\u2019ll be drowned in moments including them... Even if  Sairei no Hebi makes you wonder whether it\u2019s actually Yuji or not who is speaking.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love the past characters then I\u2019d advise you to keep any hopes for their appearances in firmly on the harsh reality that they\u2019re rarely referenced to if at all.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love a brand new cast of people who you really don\u2019t want to give a damn about then this will be perfect as you can kiss all those LAME characters from before goodbye and say hello to a great amount of characters with as much personality as bread!\\n\\n\r\nOkay, okay I\u2019ve had enough of a rant on the new guys, it\u2019s time for something serious here.\\n\\n\r\nThe Flame Hazes.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t really understand them from the get-go to be honest. All I knew was that they were a large group of people who killed Guze-no-Tomogara for the sake of balancing the world.\\n\\n\r\nThis made me question why they decide to kill so many throughout the season with little to no care for the so called,\u201dImbalance of Existence\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nI always assumed what they did as a job, and there\u2019s a level of understanding where taking care of these creatures is what they do for a living.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, in this case the Flame Haze are presented with the perfect opportunity to remove those whom imbalance the amount of existence. So what do they do? Rebel. Why? Because they don\u2019t want to loose purpose.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, the entire focus of the season is how Yuji wishes to remove the Flame Hazes enemies, yet the fight against the Guze-no-Tomogara based on the fact that they want to continue fighting them until they\u2019re killed.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I missed something out, maybe I\u2019ve watched to many faced paced scenes to remember the plot, maybe there\u2019d be a big imbalance of existence if they all disappeared.\\n\\n\r\nBut when you watch the ending to Final you can only facepalm at the stubbornness and idiocy of the Flame Hazes. I wont ruin the moment for you, if you want to have the living hell confused out of you then go ahead and watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result however the only form of character development involves a little bit between Yuji and Shana while the fantastic new cast introduced to the show and the Flame Hazes spoil any other enjoyment you may get out of characters.\\n\\n\r\nI end my rant here with a 2/10 since there was just enough development to gain an extra mark from the lowest possible rating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nPlease, if you just read everything before this you should now mostly how feel.\\n\\n\r\nThis is mostly a summary of what I\u2019ve previously said.\\n\\n\r\nDespite enjoying the first two seasons and specials a great deal, Final was highly disappointing. The plot was all that kept me going while I suffered through countless scenes filled with action-packed battles between people I didn\u2019t know with character traits that I couldn\u2019t understand. The musical score was repeated enough to make me feel sick, excluding \u2018Light My Fire\u2019 and the art was generally alright.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it?\\n\\n\r\nOnly during the first few episodes, episode nineteen and the final episode. (I partially enjoyed the final episode merely because it ended.)\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, 4/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it\u2019s a clunky mess of dissatisfaction. If you\u2019re watching it for the story rather than the fighting then you\u2019re going to be let down a lot and there\u2019ll be a long wait before you see the plot develop.\\n\\n\r\nAt times you may find yourself crying, either with confusion, anger or disappointment. I almost cried myself during those final few minutes at the end, because of how sad I was that something so awesome could become so bad.\\n\\n\r\nWhereas if you\u2019re a die-hard fan of the series overall then there\u2019s no doubt that you\u2019ll probably enjoy a fair part of it, what you make of the new characters is really personal preference.\\n\\n\r\nAs a sequel to the rest of the series, all of which I gave 7/10, it\u2019s ultimately inferior. Everything from beforehand is thrown out while a whole new angle for both plot and characters is taken.\\n\\n\r\nEven the resolve to the story is so stupid that I can\u2019t being to express how much my understanding has dropped.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve never truly felt let down by a sequel before today which really kicked the rest of Shakugan no Shana in the unmentionables. Again, whether you are or not is entirely up to how you feel with drastic changes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so I reach my conclusion. I\u2019ve probably left a lot out from before, mostly to avoid spoilers and also due to the fact that I never want to relive this again.\\n\\n\r\nI stand by my decision saying 3/10 is the way to go with this.\\n\\n\r\nIf it was a stand alone piece it would get about 6/10 on a good day, but when you take into account how decent the first two seasons and specials were, it\u2019s only worth your time for the plot.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m off to watch the first episode of Shakugan no Shana. Perhaps contradictory to what I\u2019ve said, but after this train wreck of a series, I\u2019ll probably be overcome with happiness and nostalgia at how much I enjoyed the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review, driven by my disappointment, I hope this has been somewhat helpful.",

Closest the what I wanted was Romeo/Juliet but it had that sad ending , and I also wanted to characters to be together all the way. I always searched , and still searching '' Anime like ''Kaze No Stigma'' With MORE ROMANCE '' , but never actually found what I was looking for. But now , it changed . Only problem is, this is the last season , and not even finished .I have to wait weeks , even months .. So if there is anyone reading this, and has the same taste like me , please , feel free to talk and recommend.\\n\r\nI am loving this so far , and writing my first review to this.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course , the anime :\\n\\n\r\nSince I only watched the first episodes (7 at the moment) Imagine me saying ''for now'' at the end of each sentences.\\n\\n\r\nMain character become powerfull ,  both mental and physical. \\n\r\nHe is now sure about his feelings , and MORE importantly , actually understands the ones around him.\\n\r\nAnd also , at last , he made his choice in that love triangle . I don't know if there is anyone loves triangles, but I don't , and in this one , It was more obvious than any other anime that who will he choose. I'm glad that everything is clear , and no more triangles (Hopefully).\\n\r\nAnd his powers, or Snake of Festival's I should say ? , makes action scenes so good , I don't think there is even a word to truly describe it.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said , I wanted something like ''Kaze no Stigma'' , which had very powerfull ( Mentally and Physically ) main character , with more romance , I think found it . Deja vu , I think it's my second time saying this but forgive me , I'm just full of happines right now.  \\n\r\nOnly thing bad about this anime = It has ''(Final)''  in it's name..\\n\\n\r\nI'm finishing this short review right now , hopefully someone will read it . Thank you for taking your time to read it .",

Man, this series is epic. The final season of the Shana and Yuuji and they became enemies, the action in this anime is awesome. I said in my previous review about Fate/Zero that F/Z is the best anime of that season, which is obviously wrong (I only watched i think 3 episodes of that series when i wrote that review, and i haven'twatched Shana III during that time). The cuteness of Shana is still there, The development of relationships of each characters, The uselessness of Kasumi is there.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just waiting right now on how will they end up the Finale of this series which excites me.",

            "content": "The following review will contain spoilers. I was a fan of this series following a recommendation to watch the first season of Shakugan no Shana. After many years of waiting, I was very excited to see that the final season was being produced and had to see how it would end. I will tell you that if you only care about action, pretty drawings, and good sound work, our opinions on this final installment of Shakugan no Shana shall be very different; however, if you actually care about story quality and proper character development, we may find solidarity in the thoughts displayed in this review.The main character, Sakai Yuji, goes from being your typical average guy that gains power and evolves as a man into an anti-villain who has, with little to no explanation, joined forces with the enemies Yuji had been fighting in the rest of the series. Even though Yuji suddenly joins bodies with the leader of Bal Masque, in the process kidnapping the two women who love him and starting a full scale war against the people viewers were lead to believe were on the side of justice, that in and of itself did not bother me. Stories always evolve and change as a series goes on. The issue that truly agitated me regarding this series was its blatant lack of proper development. New and radically different elements to the established story were constantly thrown at you without something as simple as a subtle introduction. In addition, many new characters were tossed into situations that would require sympathy from the viewer, once again, without proper development. Just being upset with the direction that the series took is not enough for me to give such a poor review. What warranted my utter rage and disappointment week after week was the drop in quality. I gave Shakugan no Shana Final a 2 rather than a 1 for the overall rating because the site says that a 1 is \"unwatchable\" and I did make it through. Not so much because it was worth it, but because I had a stubborn desire to see how a series that I really enjoyed ended.",

Oh my god, my jaw dropped, my mouth was gaping open, my eyes were rolling with disbelief when I saw the score.\r\nWhy is this anime bad? Well, let's see...\r\nThe story is poor.\r\n-> A lot of support characters were popping out of nowhere. The writer was trying to make them appear important / look like some big shots, but we viewers hardly cared about them. The reason is they don't even have a proper introduction or background story.\r\n-> How about the battle / war? There are waaay too many scenes of generic nameless characters whomnobody cared about, duked at it each other with no end in sight. While all of that happened, an old hag sat down on her chair calmly, sipping her tea and going \"Hmmmm...\"\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fair. The main characters are drawn properly, standard anime style, big eyes, small nose and chin, but those nameless characters are drawn sloppily / lazily. They could have been made faceless, and it won't make a difference.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is very good. The BGMs are done by Ootani Kou, they are good and fit the mood just like season 1 and 2. Kawada Mami and Kotoko are good singers as always. While Altima handles both of the ending songs. They are EPIC. Which Altima's song isn't?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are poor.\\n\r\n-> The motivations of the so called 'good guys' are ridiculous. They are mostly because of butthurt / unable to forgive the past. Also at least one of them was just a battle crazed freak. Also one of them was a hundreds years old obaa-san who's still trying to act cute at her age. Also one of them was a old hag in nun outfit and granny pants.\\n\r\n-> The heroine and the antagonist is even more poor. The heroine's motivation is really unclear. Is it a sense of duty? Is it some blind love? Is she simply going with the flow? Bah. Also the antagonist is one of the most awful character I have ever seen. He is supposed to be a good guy, actually, but his actions are totally opposite of that, and caused misunderstanding up until last episode.\\n\\n\r\nHow about enjoyment? Poor. I almost fall asleep because there are too many useless scenes and talks.",

I've liked it, and if I had to review it I'd say its outstanding. But for my point of view for this season. Its going to be good, I also like the voice actors, so I put outstanding on sound, Art is obviously very good so I put Great, but the new storyline isvery much not my taste so I'm not going to expect anything better. The story shows signs of the story turning into the worst case scenario, a very bad end for the character. Specifically, Sakai Yuuji. I'm not going to spoil you on what happened to him, I'll let you guys see for yourselves. Now, I'm the kind of guy who is a romanticist, so I would prefer a good end. And even if it WAS a good end. Almost all of the story has already been very much messed up. I'd say its a good anime. But the new story is definitely not my taste.\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: This isn't the first time I've reviewed on an anime, but this is the first time I've actually made such a poor review.

Enough with the introductions so let's get started!\r\nIn my point of view, Shakugan no Shana III caught me off-guard. The suddenly twist of plot from the ending of the last season. I quite hated it from the start when I was just around watching the first 3 episodes. But it gets better as you continue watching it.\r\nSTORY - 9/10 - I gave it 9 out of 10 because of how creative the story was created. Even though there are some partsthat are rather boring. But overall the story was great.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 10/10 - Shakugan no Shana excels in this aspect. I love how they change the opening theme song every arc or so. Or rather the sounds were actually 'that' good.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 9/10 - I didn't gave it 10/10 because I was quite annoyed by Yoshida Kazumi. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10/10 - Well I'm not some kind of witch but the enjoyment factor is actually based off from my opinion. But I enjoyed the series throughout. :)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 9/10 - I recommend you to watch Shakugan no Shana III. But don't forget to start from the first season! You won't regret it. Hontoni. :)\\n\\n",

And, we would all expect that in SnS III he would clarify who he wants etc. etc. And when the release was one year late, (It was supposed to be released in 2011, but the original SnS website say it will be late) I expect them to shoot out some quantum awesome thing.\r\nHowever, I was left disappointed, very very disappointed. First of all, SnS III barely touches Shana's tsundere side or even thelove triangle. The small bit of school life is also gone and the original side characters barely made an appearance. New sub characters were introduced (well, it is a war) and let me tell you, I don't even remember half of them and their purpose.\\n\\n\r\nIn SnS and SnS II, the story emphasize on Shana and Yuji fighting Tomogara and trying to make progress in their 'love'. All is lost when Yuji disappeared. In the end, they all march to war and the place looks like a permanent Fuzetsu. To make thing worst, while the first part of the war is going on, Shana is MIA (inside Yuki's castle).\\n\\n\r\nShe later appeared on while an insane amount of power, even though she have been training with Margery for what? Two weeks?\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is so boring and it revolves around a lot of talking and talking. SnS III in my opinion should just shorten itself to 12 episodes instead of dragging on for 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters seems different somehow, Shana became as she is in SnS and Yuji became ye ol' villain. Kazumi appeared once in a while and Sato and company rarely appears.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music, namely Light my Fire and One, is quite enjoyable. Well, at least they maintain the standard like Hishoku no Sora from SnS and Joint from SnS II.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is the same and the fighting sences are more pro since Shana became extremely powerful (in the second part), same goes for Yuji. So, epic fight.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, I feel that they could have done a better job. Hopefully, this does not kill all the fans of SnS, SnS II and SnS S. But, it killed me.",

            "content": "I have one question: who wrote this?\r\nI'm very sure that back in 2011 after watching SNS season 2, that it wasn't horrible as what season 3 turned out. Only because I missed some Kugi-chan action did I opt to watch this now, and was nowhere near where season 2 left. Season 3 was all plot-driven, it was all dreadful.\r\nSTORY = 2\r\nYep. Dreadful it is. I took time to read some of the high-rated reviews here and I get their main point: read the light novel, my backside. Read, because that is the original version of the Shakugan no Shana storyline. However, that's just the sameas telling me I should read the entire graphic novel of TheWalkingDead to enjoy its TV adaptation. But AMC and others concerned with the production didn't require us to do so, and the TWD TV version is as brilliant or acclaimed better than its original graphic novel. I could say JC Staff should have done something like that, too, which they didn't.\\n\\n\r\nThis is unexpectedly disappointing, however despite I understand the \"original adaptation\" thingy that Shanatards emphasize, the writer/JC Staff/whoever has the key role here did have three choices:\\n\r\na. they could continue s1 and s2's efforts, solidifying the fans' expectations, nevermind those who had known the light novels;\\n\r\nb. They should have done this \"true adaptation\" back in season 1 so we won't be wasting our time;\\n\r\nc. They can choose to just f*ck this up. Who cares about plot and story? We want the money. They said.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I guess they chose letter C.\\n\r\nThe thing is about the entire SNShana installment, is whoever tried to deviate the animation story from the original should have bet his/her entire money on seeing it through. It's what's proper, it's what should have been done. Thanks to the \"reverting to the original\" efforts, SNShana ended up 100% plot-driven. Characters Yuji and Shana seemed to have ambivalent feelings towards their choices and decisions and still, they chose something their dialogues and scripts didn't state. That goes for the entire cast of characters as well. \\n\r\nPlus, what's worse than a plot-driven story is the \"Deus ex Machina\", and this element is as bountiful as their power of existence had been.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, what I can point out to the story, and sorry to say this, but I'm totally unimpressed and eye-rolling towards the entire \"religious innuendos\". \\n\r\nMost of the side of the Flame Hazes' specifically the Crimson Lords have devilish names such as \"Behemoth\" and \"Alastor\", whereas on the other side constitutes of the \"Trinity\" and the \"god of creation\", and the rapture and the apocalyptic---pah.\\n\r\nIf I had known this was the entire plot of Shana all along, I should have watched this when I yet to age 12, because back then I enjoyed Gundam Wing and Angelic Layer, then I'm pretty sure I could have enjoyed SNShana season 3 very well; because by the time I turned 13, I know I would be focusing on better stories like Gurren Lagann for example. \\n\r\nNow that I'm older, I'm infuriating, and cussing, and pulling some of my hair, and calculating about 10hours of time wasted watching this, and 20hours more of watching both s1 and s2.\\n\\n\r\nShanatards would surely like to see all those explosions and fights, but only a child or a monkey can be fascinated by those, especially if you've spent watching season 1 and 2 with a regard of 7 or 8 rating, the \"reverting-to-the-original season3\" failed to impress even a tiny bit because it ruined the pace of execution of the story. I can assure you that even if this plot is added with the USS Enterprise, the Millennium Falcon, two Gundams, and alchemy, tyrant's eye---none of those will make me think otherwise, because the plot itself is beyond salvage, it's ruined.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART = 10\\n\r\nyes, give this a 10. JC Staff's only good side.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 7\\n\r\nSurely though, Kotoko and Mami Kawada music transmits that Shana-esque vibe, but that can't atone for the damage caused.\\n\r\nAlso, even with Ai Kayano, Yuki Kaji, Marina Inoue and Natsumi Takamori were added on the seiyuu cast, none of them matters. I'm pretty sure that they were overjoyed being casts on SNShana 3, but I can bet you that by the time they finished their voice-recording, they've all realized what a complete waste of time it had been.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERIZATION = 2\\n\r\nThe plot is dreadful, moreso the characterization. With the \"reverting of season 3 to light novel\" as claimed by Shanatards went, the characterizations were all derailed and was cut off from the progress of what season 2 left which resulted to uneven pacing and deus ex machina, and the very fact that no matter what dialogues the characters were delivering, the plot just proceeds on itself, leaving the viewer wondering why and what happened.\\n\r\nFor example, how did Sakai Yuji ever reached the conclusion that the best way to help Shana is to side with the Denizens and the trinity and a new snake-guy never heard of in season 1 and 2? If this is the s1-s2 Yuji, you know that he won't decide on that. But the s3 version of him is just what the author penned him to without a care of what/who he used to.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's worse. Adding too many characters as extras for the \"great war\" proved to be useless, unnecessary and out of context. Because here we know that there were thousands of Flame Hazes as \"merely mentioned\" in season 1, but we caught a glimpse this season 3 that apart from the main and supporting characters, these extra flame hazes are nothing more but salarymen, housewives, and otakus. They couldn't even transform into something else (yes it might be expensive to animate but this is Shana, if they could make a ton of magic circle, they could easily animate anything and anyone else more) and was not even clear if they had their own vessel/crimson lord or they were just wielding swords to look like the part. Then because there were so many extras, everyone should just have to have a screentime of 3mins and needs to die after.\\n\r\nSupporting antagonists also suffered the 3mins-fate, very few died while some others forgot they used to have roles back in season 2 and 1---and whatever happened to Hecate's feelings, all these were a gigantic pile of mess.\\n\\n\r\nAs if the mess wasn't bad enough, some characters suddenly had too much of too many powers/abilities that even if a Gundam, Saitama, Ryuuko, the Jedi council will pass in the middle of their so-called war, you'll certainly not notice them because of the barrage of whatnot powers been already displayed. Of course, the premise goes to that they had these powers inside them for a thousand years or more, but that's a flimsy and childish excuse, too lazy to elaborate and was just all too wonky to convince, unless you're a kid or those who are easily impressed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 1\\n\r\nThis is the first time I ever tried to take breaks upon finishing an episode. Usually I could finish 3-5eps straight; even Glasslip got me about 2eps before breathing out. But here in SNShana s3, I longed for the day to get this thing done, finished, and reviewed here in MAL to warn others that you go waste your time in some anime else. I mean, I watched Tamayura just to ease my mind in this SNShana s3, re-played NFSMW (2005), and listened/discovered more David Bowie songs---all these while dreading that I was about to watch the next episode soon. Now, glad that's over.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 3\\n\r\nThe power of existence of season 3 proved to be like a Ford Fiesta that was placed with a Mustang engine, in which the Ford engineers patted themselves on the back for a job well done, but Ford fans knew better as to what a Fiesta would look like with a V8. If in reality they did do something like this, Ford fans might chase them out with Camaros and Corvettes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what about a Focus on Mustang V8 engine? Sounds good, eh?\\n\\n\r\nHence, like the analogy of the Focus bridging the Fiesta to the Mustang, this is what I could have strongly suggested on SNShana 3: this could have been a season 4, or a Shana movie that bridges the gap of season 2 to 3, or some OVAs to do just those---anything that can \"bridge\" and \"provide information\" on events that will lead to season 3, not just taking the premise and leaving it out to the viewer's imagiation.\\n\r\nInstead, JC Staff and whoever wrote this proceeded that putting a great war and misaligned characters will be a huge hit, and it will be the greatest epic Shana season ever.\\n\r\nNo it isn't.\\n\r\nA monkey can clap hands on the explosions, kids can cheer on the fights, but to Shana fans (not necessarily Shanatards), this is an insult. We could have started watching season 1 as the \"default, original intended light-novel version\" and I know I'll give this an 8-10 rating; however putting a different s3 from s1 and s2 where Shana and the others' characterizations have been popularized, loved, and respected, this was a disaster in storytelling. Shana and Yuji's and the rest's power of existence were basically disregarded and ripped to be replaced with \"plot-driven characters\" who kept saying craps and pieces to which the plot just took them to what the author decided-- not from the causes and effects of their decisions. Thus, the characters you know from s1 and s2 left their souls on those previous seasons.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: could have been great, if only the storytelling of the season 3 were all made to be parallel and connecting to the previous seasons.",

            "content": "My jaw dropped after seeing the reviews for the season finale, I was really disappointed at the community and this site in general. How can you rate such a well executed and series defining season as anything less than astonishing? \r\nFirst and foremost J.C hired the author to supervise development in order to keep the lore as faithful as possible to the original work. I mean the season was actually canon compared to the bullshit scripts they used in their first two seasons. Perhaps there were a few intricate scenes that weren't added in which the fans were expecting to see but apart from suchgratuities they shouldered the light novel's burden with very few inaccuracies keeping it faithful to the books until the end.\\n\\n\r\nNow most hate originates from the sudden and vast amount of change, and I mean it's so grand that the setting itself is at threat. Tons of new characters were introduced and many returning characters who played previous core roles came back to be sparsely used and receive small insignificant ones such as Yoshida who made little appearance to the exception of the start and end of the series and even then she was vaguely there. Though there may have been many new characters, those new roles added a lot of flavour to the show incorporating many new personalities ranging from the daredevil rebecca reed to the subtle, shy rose shaped cocytus brigid. \\n\\n\r\nApart from all the added characters the two that the series depended and revolved around also underwent change. The protagonist and the heroine or should I say the antagonist and the heroine? At the beginning of the season the boy dotes upon the philosophy of change and what it would accomplish if he were given the strength to change the world and eventually under the influence of the deity Serei no Hebi(voiced by AYAMI SHOW) he takes the task to achieve a better tomorrow for his friends family and loved ones, but to the expense of the girl he loves whom he has to fight against in order to save. At that moment and as we progress through the series we get glimpses at how drastic his personality has shifted from a scared boy who let the surprise of the moment swing his mood to a daunting young man incorporated with the traits and charisma of the Snake. This was what I think J.C struggled the most with, shaping Yuji's character to one that represents his ideal self influenced by his decision to change, and the half shared by the deity. Though they are the same entity they both have distinct voice actors, one that portrays the newly reformed Sakai Yuji and the other that reflects the snake's wisdom.(Who can do a better job than AYAMI SHOW for an immortal badass snake that has lived for over a millennium?) Although they've never contradicted the other the two are easily seen as different individuals who can be distinguished even if they bore the same voice. Despite Yuji's polar change at the start of the season he also grows on certain occasions where he's given the opportunity to confront his old classmates he left behind giving a thorough speech to them on his motives and reasoning behind fighting against what they perceived as good and clearing any misconceptions the viewers may have formerly had.\\n\\n\r\nAs Sakai Yuji develops a more complex character the same can be said alongside the heroine Shana who struggles against her own insecurities the first half of the season and turns into a fine dependable young woman the next. Her personality at the start is a port from the second season as she slowly realizes her own true nature and strength which she later demonstrates against Sakai Yuji who defeated her in Misaki city. Following her defeat she learned to quell the emotions and feelings she couldn't answer and confessed to him when they met proving her own desire to change that rivalled that of Yuji's actions. Shana's change wasn't as notable as the Prota/anta but it was without a doubt more character development in 10 episodes than what you would see in 100 naruto episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWell it's true that the season lacked in the harem department but the scenes involving Shana and Yuji confessing their ideals to each other and how they fought for a better future together were more emotionally involving than the entirety of the second season. I fail to see how some found the season boring, I obviously don't share in your opinion since I remember the great deal of satisfaction I felt at each episode when the series was still airing and the yearn for episode 12 after episode 11 ended on a cliffhanger and had the next episode delayed for two weeks.\\n",

            "content": "Before reading this please note that:\r\n-This  review will be broken down into two separate reviews, one for the season and one for the overall series\r\n-This review may contain light spoilers\r\n-This review is from the standpoint of a person who loves a good romance anime\r\n**PART 1- THE SEASON**\r\nFor any reason that you are persuaded to not watch this anime, WATCH IT. This season is a direct sequel to the second season to the point where Yuuji has to choose between Shana and Kazumi. But something has gone wrong and Yuuji has disappeared. Then we learn that our main male protaganist is pursuing the role asthe leader of the Bal Masqu\u00e9. I know it sounds a little fishy and it seems that Yuuji has become corrupted but i ensure you that he has his reasons.\\n\\n\r\nStory-10/10\\n\r\nThe story is what makes this season the best season of them all in the Shakugan no shana anime. There are twists and turns. There are sad parts, parts in which you can chuckle at, parts that make you frustrated, and parts that you will remember for the rest of your life. The whole thing about Yuuji and the Bal Masque is confusing and makes you want to punch Yuuji through the computer monitor but it is well put together and i applaud an anime with plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9/10\\n\r\nI believe that i seen the same animations and quality of art through the 3 seasons (roughly 5 years) which is great but i would think that it could had changed for the better for a 2011 anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10/10\\n\r\nI'm almost always not a critic when it comes to sound but the soundtrack was AWESOME! and the English voice actors where great (like always).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-7/10\\n\r\nI believe that this season added too much characters and gives back-stories for too much of them but then again the whole 3rd season is about a giant war. Still the character of Shana always impresses me, i believe that she is a very 3-d character meaning she has outside personalities like being harsh, but in the inside she has hidden romantic feelings and leadership qualities. Yuuji on the other hand i didn't really like until this season because i think he was indecisive at times and did things that went against Shana. This season Yuuji redeemed himself stating that the reason why he does what he does is for the people that he loves, like Shana. And then that whole thing about Margery and Keisaku is really great. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10/10\\n\r\nCredit the amazing ending for the enjoyment because this season is just basically a giant cat and mouse game. Seasons one and two had a mix between comedy, romance, action, and school life. But war and romance are the only two themes in this season. Which is great for those who has came to this anime for romance (like myself) but not so great for the people who came to this anime for the sole purpose of action. Meaning that the battles were not that great like a Dragon ball battle or a Naruto battle. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-10/10\\n\r\nThis anime quickly shot up to one of my favorites of all time almost everything was spot on, the errors and bad things about this anime was quickly overshadowed by the all of the great things. \\n\\n\\n\r\n**PART 2- THE SERIES**\\n\r\nOh it's been a hell of a ride through almost 80 episodes and there was a great payoff. Seriously Shakugan no Shana was a anime that had me quite surprised but i guess i should had knew it was good because it shared a lot of the themes from the familiar of zero which is up there as one of my favorites. This is one of those anime in which your not going to be moved by it like a Clannad but you are going to deeply enjoy it and cherish the memories of watching it for as long as you live because i know i will.",

And just the start of episode one, i asked my self \"Is this even the same studio?\" I then decided to give the show a chance. Kept watching and I'm not gonna lie, I started to like this to an extent. Then when I began to get excited it was just killed. \r\nSPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!!!\r\nThen this entire thing lost me. We go through episodes at a time of this battle, watch multiple people die, then Phele shows up(DAMNIT Why didn't Yoshida die D: thanks for ruining that too.) And then after allthat, they still fail to accomplish their objective, and they then are all fine with it? I don't even understand why they resisted in the first place. I actually refuse to acknowledge this season.\\n\\n\r\nNow that that's out of my system, I will quickly cover the rest.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Art: I don't know about everyone else, but it's the same as Season 2/1(Although, the music in this seemed way more epic). In short, i left sound and art at an 8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Well i honestly thought that really no characters BUT the God of Creation made any sense in this season. Everyone else sorta just dramatically acts without making any sense. I dropped this to a 6.\\n\\n\r\nNow I usually calculate my overall by Grouping Art & Sound, Story, Character and enjoyment Twice as an average(Unless, like in this case, I feel the overall Wouldn't reflect how i feel it was). This Season was disappointing enough I didn't even calculate it, and just put a 4 for the overall. \\n\\n\r\nLong story short, If you are excited to see Season 3, well don't keep your hopes high.",

            "content": "The final series, of the Shakugan No Shana story. I personally found this one the best out of the 3, plenty of action, romance mainly focus on Yuji and Shana not that bitch Kazumi. Some people say that the 3rd series lacked romance compare to the other 2, i strongly disagree, Shakugan no Shana II almost half of the series was all useless fan service, the only bit of romance was probably the end. I admit that the 1st one probably had more romance compare to the 3rd one, but the 1st one had significantly less fights than the 3rd one.\r\nStory 9\r\nThe must unexpected twistin a story i had ever seen, never in a million years did i think that Yuji will join up with BM (Bal Masque) and fight against the FH (flame haze). Yuji  who had the God of creations, Sairei no Hebi in him, wanted to free shana from the destiny of the flame haze, a never ending fight against the tomogara. The fights between Yuji and Shana led to romance development between them which was pretty nice to watch and enjoy, Yuji FINALLY chooses a girl after 50 episodes... Season 3 is basically a war between the Tomogara and the Flame haze, Yuji who wanted to create a world for the Tomogara, meaning they will all leave the current world and flame haze wouldn't fight anymore, at the start I was thinking \"great thats good, finally peace\" so i was VERY confused on why the flame haze continued to fight even though Yuji's action will lead to peace, after rewatching those episodes several times i realised that the Flame Haze was fighting for the future while Tomogara was fighting for the present, that was the only difference. If we were playing a game, you can call the ending a \"good end\" like its literally a good end with no bad outcomes and everyones happy, very first time witnessing one. I found this ending to be absolutely amazing, even rewatching just the last 5 mins a hundred times, i still get emotional at Shana and Yuji's talk =P.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8 \\n\\n\r\nYuji's new look is pretty badass, he looks like a true villain. Most of the character design didn't really change, everybody still looks the same but i guess they can't really change much considering their clothes are part of their weapons. I think the animation of the massive fight scenes were pretty well done, most the FH looked different, but for the tomogara, you can see the same one like 10 times they didn't really put much effort in it, but i guess it'll be hard to come up with loads of unique monster designs. The new characters were also quite good as well, with the new tomogara design weird as ever and monstery like and the new flame haze well, there all very different and their clothes really match their personality.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8\\n\\n\r\nThe opening songs is as amazing as ever, even after listening to them probably about a hundred times on youtube and on my phone I'm still not bored of it. The ost is quite well done, i especially like the one in the ending, a nice slow piano theme while Yuji and Shana is talking about their relationship. The fight OST is pretty good as well. The ending songs is also as amazing as ever, i especially like what they do now where they have part of the ending song playing just before the end of the episode, for me it kinda created a cliffhanger feeling making me want to watch more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9 \\n\\n\r\nIt really is amazing to see how much Shana has changed, from a complete Tsundere into someone who can freely express her feelings but i do love the bit in the end where she uses Urusai x3 again at that point i was just thinking \"YAY shes back woooo!'. In this season she's more open towards all the character and it soon becomes clear that because of this  it has affected everyone else as well especially Wilhelmina, at the start she refused to recognise Shana as a flame haze due to Shana's feeling, but now after 2 seasons she finally accepts Shana. Plus I think she became more soft, and more opening as well. In the past 2 season's Yuji was pretty predictable, you knew what he was doing and their was nothing mysterious about him, That all changed in season 3, He became a character that is the complete opposite, and in a way Shana became more like what Yuji was before. This was actually kinda fun to enjoy for me, for Yuji who was always following Shana to actually oppose her feels like he finally became a man, but i know a lot of viewers who disliked the fact that they fight. One thing i am especially happy about is Kazumi finally being out of this love triangle, no more obstacle's between Shana and Yuji or so i thought... The introduction of new and old flame hazes/tomogara was pretty good, it shows just how large the armies of both sides was. Love seeing Khamsin again and Rebecca was a pretty interesting new character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9 \\n\\n\r\nThis anime was probably about 70% fight scenes, with about 20% romance, the fight scenes was very enjoyable to watch, the plans that the FH came up with, the sacrifices that occur. Although the comedy factor of this anime was gone, I found the new relationship developments between Yuji and Shana very enjoyable to watch, each scene was very heartwarming. I liked the story of season 3 the most, it finally felt like that story was going somewhere, in the last 2 seasons it was always the same, Bal Masque did something Flame haze stopped them. Which probably made it quite enjoyable to watch for me. Best bits of the anime was probably when Yuji's tells of his plan, and the ending. The ending is just.... words can't describe it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall I didn't think the story was lacking anywhere probably except for some character design of the minions of Tomogara, but its not a big deal, the Story is better than the other 2 although the romance was lacking but it still had more than season 2. What i found pretty amazing is the character relationships and how much it developed. The opening and ending songs still top notch. The Shakugan No Shana series is a must watch, all 3 seasons is really good in my opinion, if your a fan of Action, Romance anime then i think Shakugan no Shana is definitely for you, also with 70 something episodes you probably won't be bored for a while or at least a week =P. For people who says omg i want season 4, its not gonna happen the light novel finished so URUSA!I, URUSAI!!, URUSAI!!!!",

            "content": "After waiting three seemingly long years without even an assurance of it getting an animation again, the sequel or rather the finale of one of the most famous series in the anime world is finally here.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nAs the ending of the last season was so much of a cliffhanger, we are all wondering what happened after that. To my surprise, there\u2019s even a shocking revelation right off the very first episode. It just shows the different new storyline and plot this series has to offer for this finale. There\u2019s a major twist in the story this time because of anapparent major switching of sides of one of the main characters. It is really confusing but it\u2019s just to make the revelations at the end anticipating. A full force war is always a perfect storyline for endings. And if we\u2019re talking about war, it\u2019s always about a battle of beliefs. Who\u2019s right or wrong? What is the true peace? Whose belief will prevail at the end? As always, this series loves to use interesting yet quite confusing terminologies or names for its characters. Some terms are interesting and cool but some are quite mess-up and don\u2019t even matches to the character\u2019s personality and ability. However, I am going to admit that most of the dialogues and lines are really confusing.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nFor a new season and for a finale, there are quite a number of new characters both from protagonists\u2019 and antagonists\u2019 side. Sakai Yuji has always been the type of character with an impressive improvement. From being a weak and tiny torch, he became quite a capable fighter that even Alastor was in awe. However, this time around his character development is rather more of a shocking character development which is so unexpected. Personally, I don\u2019t even particularly like him because he can really become quite irritating but in this finale, he\u2019s not only extremely irritating but he\u2019s also really confusing.  You will see Shana\u2019s abilities like you\u2019ve never seen it before. There are few new interesting techniques.  I\u2019ve always wanted for Shana and Yuji\u2019s love story to really have a development because in the last previous seasons, it was quite in a slow pace but this is so far from what I imagine it to be. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION\\n\r\nOne of the amazing things when there\u2019s quite a gap between the previous season and the sequel is the improvement with its animation. There\u2019s non-stop explosive action from start to finish, befitting the ending of one of the most successful action-fantasy series in the anime world.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI don\u2019t find making Yuji a villain and making him fight Shana interesting. It surprises me, not in a good way. Yuji sides with the enemies because he wants to protect Shana and the people he loves. But Shana thinks differently. I know that the kind of drama that comes with that kind of storyline is very common today because it\u2019s still very much effective. Making best friends or lovers go against each other particularly in series with wars at the end is really effective because it is really interesting to see characters that are once ally\u2019s ends up becoming enemies because of their different beliefs. However, it just doesn\u2019t feel right this time. After all the battle that Yuji and Shana had been through at the end Yuji sided with the enemies and fight Shana! At the end it just turns out that all of them want the same thing. Then what\u2019s the point on making the villains so effective. I feel so irritated almost the entire time I am watching this.\\n\\n\r\nI know that because this is the finale, they are going for a different and more dramatic kind of storyline and love story but it just doesn\u2019t work for me. It is so far-fetched and so over the top.\\n",

            "content": "Relationships cannot exist without bumps along the road.  There are always conflicting viewpoints between two individuals and it would not be a healthy relationship should both parties agree with each other every single time.\r\nShakugan no Shana III, the long awaited third and final season of Shakugan no Shana, has finally made its way into light.  After a cliffhanger ending from Shakugan no Shana II, SnS III picks up some time after the cliffhanger and presents the audience some shocking details that have the possibility to make or break the conclusion to this beloved anime series.\r\nThe huge shift of Sakai Yuji's disappearance takes atoll on the romantic aspect of the story.  In fact, it runs all through the season.  No mushy lovey-dovey moments between Shana and Yuji that would be expected from the first two seasons.  There are very few \"urasai, urasai, urasai!\" moments and the ones that exist do not resemble those of the previous seasons.  The changes made to the story have deeply changed the relationship between the flame haze and the torch; and to some fans, it may be too much.\\n\\n\r\nNot all is lost with the romance of the story, however; it simply took a different form.  The conflicting views of a new world between Yuji and Shana separate the two, each unable to find a compromise.  Shana yearns to discover Yuji's motives behind his actions while Yuji refrains from spilling the beans, claiming it is for the future of him and Shana.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it sounds like the basis of the story would expand much further, it sadly does not.  Shana having her most important person as an enemy is quite an intriguing situation, but it is crushed by the lack of common sense within the quarrel.  Shana and Yuji go back and forth, with Yuji leaving Shana and the audience in the dark as to what is really going on.  It's a disappointing flaw in the story, as the grounds of the plot had so much more potential to branch out.  Instead, SnS III presents viewers a overly-complicated, unnecessarily dramatic lover's quarrel.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why this story of love is so poorly executed is due to the fact that there is simply too much trying to go on all at once.  There are a significant amount of new supporting characters as well as the return of a majority of the older supporting roles.  Many of these supporting roles have intents that add spin to the already complicated storyline.  There are numerous loose ends in the story, many of which go unsolved at the end.  While the new cast is somewhat appealing, the focus on Shana and Yuji greatly overshadows the new crew which cuts the character development to a \"hey, here's a new character; enjoy!\" kind of deal.\\n\\n\r\nThe older cast proves to have developed more, but the time gap and little explanation other than a few scenes of recap make the changes a little shaky.  Shana herself has become more powerful, able to use her flame haze powers to spawn wings, a giant fiery hand, and other flame tactics.  It is said that Shana went through rigorous training to prepare for the return of the infamous Sakai Yuji.  Speaking of which, Sakai Yuji has taken a new role as a villain, and a trashy one at that.  It seems as if the old, incapable Yuji has grown a pair and comes up with an absurd idea that the world now is not cutting it.  It truly is aggravating to watch these two dispute, and the ulterior motives of Yuji carry many degrees of ignorance.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of SnS III is about as good as SnS I and II.  The visuals and fight scenes (which were severely lackluster compared to Shana I and II) maintained a fluid and clear presentation.  The details such as Shana's flames remain just like they did in the past.  While the art and animation was nice, the big problem with this is that this season did not do a good job on capitalizing it.  The season was dialogue-heavy and the dialogue was painfully boring.  The fight scenes were few and not as suspenseful or long as Shana's previous feats.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these glaring flaws, the music of SnS III does not disappoint.  The excellent performances of Kotoko and Kawada Mami bring some nostalgic feeling to this foreign-feeling season.  The OST remains constant to the previous seasons which still suits the mood well.  The voice actors also brought their A-game this time around, showing a wide array of vocal range to differentiate the huge cast of supporting roles a bit better.\\n\\n\r\nWhile SnS III's score was a delight, it is not something that can save the plot's execution.  The notion of two lovers wanting to be together but holding their own pride between them is a probable situation, but completely irritating the way Shana III went about it.  Throughout the whole season I was questioning the point of Yuji's motives while still holding hope that the explanation would be an acceptable one.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't.\\n\\n\r\nThe new face of Yuji does not mask the idiocy he already had within him.  The excuse for Shana and Yuji to be together was one that simply could not cut it.\\n\\n\r\nThis final season of Shana III was not a very enjoyable one.  There were too many irritants within the grand scheme of things that distracts from the great Shana fans have come to know and love.  This whole season seemed very foreign when compared  to the first two seasons.  It's as if this season was all a dream.  Many things were lacking or gone while many new things came into play.  It certainly was a new world for Shana and co. and I can't exactly say I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nThe attempt to go very deep into a story was very possible for 24 episodes yet the writers refrained from adding the most crucial step:  an explanation.  Watching Yuji and Shana's plans unfold becomes dull and dry too quickly when viewers are left in the dark.  A similar feeling would be watching a movie in a foreign language with no subtitles or ways to make out what the actors are saying other than through body language.\\n\\n\r\nShakugan no Shana III has finally made its course.  It had a great pile of potential but that pile was sadly trampled on.  Explanations to the vast number of changes could have easily been gifted, but they were held out until the very end.  Shakugan no Shana III had multiple things going for it, but there were too many bumps along the road to bear.",

            "content": "(This is my first review here on MAL, so I apologize for being an amateur at this. Also be aware, minor spoilers are included.)\r\nOh Shana, how low could you have gotten?\r\nI was a big Shana fan three years ago, and after hearing of the news of when season 3 was going to premier last Summer, I was overjoyed. Boy was I in for a surprise, massive disappointment.\r\nShakugan no Shana III (Final) is J.C. Staff's third and final adaption of the popular Shakugan no Shana light novel series written by Yashichiro Takahashi. Shakugan no Shana is a hot series for J.C. Staff, with each volume ofseason 1 and season 2 having sold 10,000+ copies total, and with great reason. Shakugan no Shana was a very entertaining and interesting series with the first two seasons. Season 3 however, is a whole different beast (It's even selling on average 4,000 copies per volume on average, not 10,000+ like the successful first two seasons.).\\n\\n\r\nWe start off with how Yuji has disappeared, and whether or not if he truly has had his flame burn out. This was interesting...for a while. One of the biggest issues early on with season 3 is time. They make no effort to explain when season 3 takes place (I.E. How long after the end of season 2.), and it proves to be a problem that just gets worse, confusing the viewer. Not to mention, something always associated with time, pacing. Shana III has an issue of making events either occur way too fast, or way too slow (Like slower than Dragon Ball Z almost at times.). This is very apparent during much of the first half, the war between the Flame Hazes, and the Bal Masque which also happens to be one of the most boring, if not the most boring war I've ever seen in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with the series is character development, and lack of explanations as to what's going on. Season 3's biggest issue is adding too many characters at once, and then not even bothering to provide any back-story, thus causing the viewer to hardly care about them. They'll only really be attached to the characters they know and love from the first two seasons, except of course Yuji (I'll get to this later.). As the show goes on, this only gets worse and worse as they try to make you care with touching moments, but due to the lack of proper character development, this does nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of explanations really is one of the biggest issues. It makes the show quite confusing, and leads to the viewer being quite bored. There are also many contradictions thanks to this.\\n\\n\r\nNow, Yuji. The Yuji you knew from seasons 1 and 2 is completely gone. For some, this may be a good thing, but for others, it's quite a bad thing. Basically early on he has The Snake of the Festival take over his body. We have no idea where Yuji was, or where The Snake of the Festival came in which goes back to the issue of the lack of explanations and time. The Snake of the Festival later takes over as leader of the Bal Masque (As he was their former boss before he was sealed away.), and his goal first is to free his old body (Which of course, is a giant snake.), and he has another thing up his sleeve (He reveals this during the war.) which I won't post about due to spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and art (Well, it's not as good, but it works.) are pretty much on par with the first two seasons, and they're what help hold this show up from being a 3/10 show or lower. It helps make the show still somewhat enjoyable. They're the best things about the show, which is such a shame. The entertainment value is there, but not much. A few episodes I've found have been quite a chore to watch even.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shana III is a massive disappointment, and only devoted Shana fans will really have any reason to watch this, the main one being just to finish the story (This is the only reason why I haven't dropped it, I really want to see the end.). I may edit this after I see the end, but I don't expect this show to get much better.\\n\\n\r\nEdit 3/30/2012 after seeing episodes 23 and 24 (The original part of the review was on 1-22):\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 23 didn't really help the show (It suffered from the same problems that are very apparent in the series), but episode 24 was worth watching (It's pretty much the only episode really worth watching). We get a decent enough ending which actually resulted in some decent character development.",

SNS s3 was somewhat confusing at first impression (one minutes into the show), but the unexpected opening quickly piqued my imagination. It appears that the protagonist had reversed and became antagonist. With the briefly explained background information of the first episode, the viewer may have difficulties understanding the reasons behind protagonist's faction change. Although I had hoped for more details in the first episode, I think that it may be best the way it is, that is lackof a complete background introduction. Overall, this animation is enjoyable and exciting, which is true in my case, The art work and sound of S3 quality was specular, I would rate the SNS s3 a 8.5/10.",

Yes, I was waiting the third season very long!\r\nThe third season of Shana - the long-awaited project from J.C.Staff, which was expected not only to fans of the most Shana, but also people who love any art of this studio.\r\nSince I myself am a fan of Shana, I can say that the ending was totally justified. This anime made \u200b\u200bme remember all the seasons of Shana and this is good news, since not every studio can do it.\r\nIn fact, in the third season added a lot of sharp turns of the plot, which is good simple viewiers. (Story - 9)\r\nNew Shana a lot ofinteresting creatures and transformations, that is good news. New monsters, interesting buildings and various specifically can fully appreciate the scale and scope of this anime. (Art - 8)\\n\\n\r\nThe music is just great! Since the release of the anime, and to this day, I listen openings and endings. (Sound - 8)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters not really changed since the second season, of course added new ones, but they are not particularly interesting. An exception can be called Sakai Yuji. (Character - 7)\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately when watching the third season of Shana sometimes there is a desire to switch off and do not watch it, because so much is not clear, but razbratsya in all of this is very difficult, but it's still interesting to know how it ends, and how the story will turn into reality. (Enjoyment - 7)\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I would like to add that all the seasons of Shakugan no Shana made \u200b\u200ba huge impression on me, and so I want to thank J.C.Staff for taking the job. They were able to do Shakugan no Shana for what it is, and a happy ending to it - it's entirely their merit. I'm glad it ended so Shakugan no Shana!\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, not that it matter much.\r\nI address this to fans of the the series,\r\nFirstly, if you enjoyed the first two seasons because of the plot, characters and nice pace, like myself, then you can kiss those things goodbye and prepare yourself for intense confusion.\r\nNow really review this.\r\nTo be completely honest, I've watched few anime with as much of an impact as Shakugan no Shana from the start. I enjoyed the first two seasons as well as the specials thoroughly, I enjoyed the concept of existence and I enjoyed the love elements placed thought out them.\r\nIn the case of Shakugan no ShanaIII Final, it seems to have butchered everything great about the first two seasons. This is because they were replaced them with endless fight scenes and a sudden increase in cast with no backstory whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say the anime itself is bad, but because the first two seasons were incredibly similar, I must say that the change in delivering the story was a little strange. Anyway, I should talk about why this sequel wasn't as good as it could have been.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nAlright, assuming you've watched the first two seasons, you should have a thorough idea of where the plot is at. However, most characters from the past barely have any screen time and those who do hardly need an explanation about themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with a nice plot twist which adds an interesting controversy from the beginning. In truth, the first episode was very similar to the first two seasons. Even the episodes following keep a nice plot going, it didn't take long though for the action to kick in.\\n\\n\r\nThe first two seasons had an equal pace of both action and progressing with the plot and somewhat decent character development. In this case you are introduced to a short and strong plot, before delving into battles that cover endless amounts of episodes. But these scenes are so long that they ignore the plot, heck they could have been condensed into half, no, a quarter of their length really easily.\\n\\n\r\nAlongside these fights you are also introduced to a cast so large that you sometimes forget about the main characters, which isn't a good thing. Though I\u2019ll address this later alongside those damn Flame Hazes.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning of the season was great to be honest, it delivered the plot with a decent pace and flow. After that you\u2019re bombarded with action packed scenes that actually like to avoid the plot. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re bad scenes, but you\u2019ll be so adjusted to the fighting that when the story progresses you\u2019ll be a little caught off.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the plot does develop, there are usually actions that take place that are completely stupid. You will most probably find yourself dumbstruck at how unbelievably crazy the things people do in the season are, however you\u2019ll have to suck it up and remember that whatever happens is never addressed to again.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a necessarily bad story, but the lack of any progression due to the fights causes you to forget the plot. I must say though that a few episodes at the end make a nod or two towards a certain someone from the first episode of the first season which really meant something.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a 5/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nI decided to combine the two since I actually have little to say on the matter for either.\\n\\n\r\nThe art remains similar to it\u2019s prequels, here and there you notice a little more detail than usual but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nThe truly exceptional factor in the art is that no matter how fast paced things get, you\u2019re still supplied with decently fluid animation and detail. Being a twenty-six episode season there are naturally a ton of scenes and a lot that needs to be tended to during those full scale fight scenes with an entire army of people.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this I really admire the people who animated and coloured every scene throughout the season, even the computer generated snow and stuff is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound however... It took a turn for the worst. While the first two seasons gave you soundtracks with emotion, tension and meaning all I heard throughout Final was dramatic music.\\n\\n\r\nThe music wasn\u2019t anything bad, not was it anything superior to the first seasons, however I heard so many pieces for action filled scenes that I swear only ever heard a cycle of five songs or so.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed all of the OP and EDs and found \u2018Light My Fire\u2019 to be a song I really enjoy. No problems there.\\n\\n\r\nTo be truthful, I don\u2019t want to go back through the series either just to try and hear those non-dramatic pieces.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects were the same as ever, satisfying. Not much else to say.\\n\\n\r\nThe art gets a 7/10 for a decent job and consistency on demand.\\n\\n\r\nThe musical score and sounds only get a 5/10 due to playing their part in adding tension but nothing more than that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nOkay, this is where I actually begin to get annoyed since characters that played a role in the first two seasons are barely addressed to again.\\n\\n\r\nKeisaku, Eita? I think I\u2019ve heard those names before... Nope, must have been my imagination.\\n\\n\r\nPast characters who added to the plot barely got a mention during Final, which was sad since I never once disliked the cast at all. While those who did still didn\u2019t get much attention paid either.\\n\\n\r\nIn this case all there is to focus on is Sakai Yuji, Shana and an massive new cast of characters who completely stamped on any understanding you ever had of past members involved with anything at all from the plot before Final.\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many new characters which really aggravated me more than anything else. Despite the issues with the plot, despite the endless fighting, the characters are what got me most.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly and fore mostly, don\u2019t bother with remembering their names. Just don\u2019t. Because you\u2019ll not only struggle with comprehending the battles and the plot, but also who you are watching make the plot happen.\\n\\n\r\nNot only is the cast incredibly large and time consuming to remember, but the story flickers between all of them constantly. At a fair few points some die and you\u2019ll either say, \u201cWho was that?\u201d or you\u2019ll forget them in a short time anyway because someone new has probably been introduced by then.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, it seems that we didn\u2019t have to bother with remembering their backstory since it is NEVER explained. Okay, maybe one person had their past told in the most unhelpful way, but constantly shifting between people in the story left it incredibly difficult to keep track of anything!\\n\\n\r\nPersonality wise... You will still be lost as the new characters reveal barely anything about themselves. Leaving you with bland characters who probably can\u2019t make an apocalypse exciting.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love Yuji and Shana however you\u2019ll be drowned in moments including them... Even if  Sairei no Hebi makes you wonder whether it\u2019s actually Yuji or not who is speaking.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love the past characters then I\u2019d advise you to keep any hopes for their appearances in firmly on the harsh reality that they\u2019re rarely referenced to if at all.\\n\\n\r\nIf you love a brand new cast of people who you really don\u2019t want to give a damn about then this will be perfect as you can kiss all those LAME characters from before goodbye and say hello to a great amount of characters with as much personality as bread!\\n\\n\r\nOkay, okay I\u2019ve had enough of a rant on the new guys, it\u2019s time for something serious here.\\n\\n\r\nThe Flame Hazes.\\n\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t really understand them from the get-go to be honest. All I knew was that they were a large group of people who killed Guze-no-Tomogara for the sake of balancing the world.\\n\\n\r\nThis made me question why they decide to kill so many throughout the season with little to no care for the so called,\u201dImbalance of Existence\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nI always assumed what they did as a job, and there\u2019s a level of understanding where taking care of these creatures is what they do for a living.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, in this case the Flame Haze are presented with the perfect opportunity to remove those whom imbalance the amount of existence. So what do they do? Rebel. Why? Because they don\u2019t want to loose purpose.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, the entire focus of the season is how Yuji wishes to remove the Flame Hazes enemies, yet the fight against the Guze-no-Tomogara based on the fact that they want to continue fighting them until they\u2019re killed.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I missed something out, maybe I\u2019ve watched to many faced paced scenes to remember the plot, maybe there\u2019d be a big imbalance of existence if they all disappeared.\\n\\n\r\nBut when you watch the ending to Final you can only facepalm at the stubbornness and idiocy of the Flame Hazes. I wont ruin the moment for you, if you want to have the living hell confused out of you then go ahead and watch it.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result however the only form of character development involves a little bit between Yuji and Shana while the fantastic new cast introduced to the show and the Flame Hazes spoil any other enjoyment you may get out of characters.\\n\\n\r\nI end my rant here with a 2/10 since there was just enough development to gain an extra mark from the lowest possible rating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nPlease, if you just read everything before this you should now mostly how feel.\\n\\n\r\nThis is mostly a summary of what I\u2019ve previously said.\\n\\n\r\nDespite enjoying the first two seasons and specials a great deal, Final was highly disappointing. The plot was all that kept me going while I suffered through countless scenes filled with action-packed battles between people I didn\u2019t know with character traits that I couldn\u2019t understand. The musical score was repeated enough to make me feel sick, excluding \u2018Light My Fire\u2019 and the art was generally alright.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it?\\n\\n\r\nOnly during the first few episodes, episode nineteen and the final episode. (I partially enjoyed the final episode merely because it ended.)\\n\\n\r\nAs a result, 4/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it\u2019s a clunky mess of dissatisfaction. If you\u2019re watching it for the story rather than the fighting then you\u2019re going to be let down a lot and there\u2019ll be a long wait before you see the plot develop.\\n\\n\r\nAt times you may find yourself crying, either with confusion, anger or disappointment. I almost cried myself during those final few minutes at the end, because of how sad I was that something so awesome could become so bad.\\n\\n\r\nWhereas if you\u2019re a die-hard fan of the series overall then there\u2019s no doubt that you\u2019ll probably enjoy a fair part of it, what you make of the new characters is really personal preference.\\n\\n\r\nAs a sequel to the rest of the series, all of which I gave 7/10, it\u2019s ultimately inferior. Everything from beforehand is thrown out while a whole new angle for both plot and characters is taken.\\n\\n\r\nEven the resolve to the story is so stupid that I can\u2019t being to express how much my understanding has dropped.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve never truly felt let down by a sequel before today which really kicked the rest of Shakugan no Shana in the unmentionables. Again, whether you are or not is entirely up to how you feel with drastic changes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so I reach my conclusion. I\u2019ve probably left a lot out from before, mostly to avoid spoilers and also due to the fact that I never want to relive this again.\\n\\n\r\nI stand by my decision saying 3/10 is the way to go with this.\\n\\n\r\nIf it was a stand alone piece it would get about 6/10 on a good day, but when you take into account how decent the first two seasons and specials were, it\u2019s only worth your time for the plot.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m off to watch the first episode of Shakugan no Shana. Perhaps contradictory to what I\u2019ve said, but after this train wreck of a series, I\u2019ll probably be overcome with happiness and nostalgia at how much I enjoyed the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review, driven by my disappointment, I hope this has been somewhat helpful.",

Closest the what I wanted was Romeo/Juliet but it had that sad ending , and I also wanted to characters to be together all the way. I always searched , and still searching '' Anime like ''Kaze No Stigma'' With MORE ROMANCE '' , but never actually found what I was looking for. But now , it changed . Only problem is, this is the last season , and not even finished .I have to wait weeks , even months .. So if there is anyone reading this, and has the same taste like me , please , feel free to talk and recommend.\\n\r\nI am loving this so far , and writing my first review to this.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course , the anime :\\n\\n\r\nSince I only watched the first episodes (7 at the moment) Imagine me saying ''for now'' at the end of each sentences.\\n\\n\r\nMain character become powerfull ,  both mental and physical. \\n\r\nHe is now sure about his feelings , and MORE importantly , actually understands the ones around him.\\n\r\nAnd also , at last , he made his choice in that love triangle . I don't know if there is anyone loves triangles, but I don't , and in this one , It was more obvious than any other anime that who will he choose. I'm glad that everything is clear , and no more triangles (Hopefully).\\n\r\nAnd his powers, or Snake of Festival's I should say ? , makes action scenes so good , I don't think there is even a word to truly describe it.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said , I wanted something like ''Kaze no Stigma'' , which had very powerfull ( Mentally and Physically ) main character , with more romance , I think found it . Deja vu , I think it's my second time saying this but forgive me , I'm just full of happines right now.  \\n\r\nOnly thing bad about this anime = It has ''(Final)''  in it's name..\\n\\n\r\nI'm finishing this short review right now , hopefully someone will read it . Thank you for taking your time to read it .",

Man, this series is epic. The final season of the Shana and Yuuji and they became enemies, the action in this anime is awesome. I said in my previous review about Fate/Zero that F/Z is the best anime of that season, which is obviously wrong (I only watched i think 3 episodes of that series when i wrote that review, and i haven'twatched Shana III during that time). The cuteness of Shana is still there, The development of relationships of each characters, The uselessness of Kasumi is there.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just waiting right now on how will they end up the Finale of this series which excites me.",

I will tell you that if you only care about action, pretty drawings, and good sound work, our opinions on this final installment of Shakugan no Shana shall be very different; however, if you actually care about story quality and proper character development, we may find solidarity in the thoughts displayed in this review.The main character, Sakai Yuji, goes from being your typical average guy that gains power and evolves as a man into an anti-villain who has, with little to no explanation, joined forces with the enemies Yuji had been fighting in the rest of the series. Even though Yuji suddenly joins bodies with the leader of Bal Masque, in the process kidnapping the two women who love him and starting a full scale war against the people viewers were lead to believe were on the side of justice, that in and of itself did not bother me. Stories always evolve and change as a series goes on. The issue that truly agitated me regarding this series was its blatant lack of proper development. New and radically different elements to the established story were constantly thrown at you without something as simple as a subtle introduction. In addition, many new characters were tossed into situations that would require sympathy from the viewer, once again, without proper development. Just being upset with the direction that the series took is not enough for me to give such a poor review. What warranted my utter rage and disappointment week after week was the drop in quality. I gave Shakugan no Shana Final a 2 rather than a 1 for the overall rating because the site says that a 1 is \"unwatchable\" and I did make it through. Not so much because it was worth it, but because I had a stubborn desire to see how a series that I really enjoyed ended.",

Oh my god, my jaw dropped, my mouth was gaping open, my eyes were rolling with disbelief when I saw the score.\r\nWhy is this anime bad? Well, let's see...\r\nThe story is poor.\r\n-> A lot of support characters were popping out of nowhere. The writer was trying to make them appear important / look like some big shots, but we viewers hardly cared about them. The reason is they don't even have a proper introduction or background story.\r\n-> How about the battle / war? There are waaay too many scenes of generic nameless characters whomnobody cared about, duked at it each other with no end in sight. While all of that happened, an old hag sat down on her chair calmly, sipping her tea and going \"Hmmmm...\"\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fair. The main characters are drawn properly, standard anime style, big eyes, small nose and chin, but those nameless characters are drawn sloppily / lazily. They could have been made faceless, and it won't make a difference.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is very good. The BGMs are done by Ootani Kou, they are good and fit the mood just like season 1 and 2. Kawada Mami and Kotoko are good singers as always. While Altima handles both of the ending songs. They are EPIC. Which Altima's song isn't?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are poor.\\n\r\n-> The motivations of the so called 'good guys' are ridiculous. They are mostly because of butthurt / unable to forgive the past. Also at least one of them was just a battle crazed freak. Also one of them was a hundreds years old obaa-san who's still trying to act cute at her age. Also one of them was a old hag in nun outfit and granny pants.\\n\r\n-> The heroine and the antagonist is even more poor. The heroine's motivation is really unclear. Is it a sense of duty? Is it some blind love? Is she simply going with the flow? Bah. Also the antagonist is one of the most awful character I have ever seen. He is supposed to be a good guy, actually, but his actions are totally opposite of that, and caused misunderstanding up until last episode.\\n\\n\r\nHow about enjoyment? Poor. I almost fall asleep because there are too many useless scenes and talks.",

For people who've watched the past episodes of this series, you may be in for quite the bumper ride of your life. I've seen the past seasons. I've liked it, and if I had to review it I'd say its outstanding. But for my point of view for this season. Its going to be good, I also like the voice actors, so I put outstanding on sound, Art is obviously very good so I put Great, but the new storyline isvery much not my taste so I'm not going to expect anything better. The story shows signs of the story turning into the worst case scenario, a very bad end for the character. Specifically, Sakai Yuuji. I'm not going to spoil you on what happened to him, I'll let you guys see for yourselves. Now, I'm the kind of guy who is a romanticist, so I would prefer a good end. And even if it WAS a good end. Almost all of the story has already been very much messed up. I'd say its a good anime. But the new story is definitely not my taste.\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: This isn't the first time I've reviewed on an anime, but this is the first time I've actually made such a poor review. I am very much disappointed in the story. It kinda reminds me of the grief I had when watching \"ENDLESS EIGHT\" From the second season of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu. Its a slight let down.",

Enough with the introductions so let's get started!\r\nIn my point of view, Shakugan no Shana III caught me off-guard. The suddenly twist of plot from the ending of the last season. I quite hated it from the start when I was just around watching the first 3 episodes. But it gets better as you continue watching it.\r\nSTORY - 9/10 - I gave it 9 out of 10 because of how creative the story was created. Even though there are some partsthat are rather boring. But overall the story was great.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 10/10 - Shakugan no Shana excels in this aspect. I love how they change the opening theme song every arc or so. Or rather the sounds were actually 'that' good.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 9/10 - I didn't gave it 10/10 because I was quite annoyed by Yoshida Kazumi. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10/10 - Well I'm not some kind of witch but the enjoyment factor is actually based off from my opinion. But I enjoyed the series throughout. :)\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 9/10 - I recommend you to watch Shakugan no Shana III. But don't forget to start from the first season! You won't regret it. Hontoni. :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let's see... Shakugan no Shana III...\r\nTo start off, I would assume you watch SnS and SnS II already. As we know, our mate Yuji have been the fight of Shana and Kazumi. And, we would all expect that in SnS III he would clarify who he wants etc. etc. And when the release was one year late, (It was supposed to be released in 2011, but the original SnS website say it will be late) I expect them to shoot out some quantum awesome thing.\r\nHowever, I was left disappointed, very very disappointed. First of all, SnS III barely touches Shana's tsundere side or even thelove triangle. The small bit of school life is also gone and the original side characters barely made an appearance. New sub characters were introduced (well, it is a war) and let me tell you, I don't even remember half of them and their purpose.\\n\\n\r\nIn SnS and SnS II, the story emphasize on Shana and Yuji fighting Tomogara and trying to make progress in their 'love'. All is lost when Yuji disappeared. In the end, they all march to war and the place looks like a permanent Fuzetsu. To make thing worst, while the first part of the war is going on, Shana is MIA (inside Yuki's castle).\\n\\n\r\nShe later appeared on while an insane amount of power, even though she have been training with Margery for what? Two weeks?\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is so boring and it revolves around a lot of talking and talking. SnS III in my opinion should just shorten itself to 12 episodes instead of dragging on for 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters seems different somehow, Shana became as she is in SnS and Yuji became ye ol' villain. Kazumi appeared once in a while and Sato and company rarely appears.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music, namely Light my Fire and One, is quite enjoyable. Well, at least they maintain the standard like Hishoku no Sora from SnS and Joint from SnS II.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is the same and the fighting sences are more pro since Shana became extremely powerful (in the second part), same goes for Yuji. So, epic fight.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, I feel that they could have done a better job. Hopefully, this does not kill all the fans of SnS, SnS II and SnS S. But, it killed me.",

            "content": "I have one question: who wrote this?\r\nI'm very sure that back in 2011 after watching SNS season 2, that it wasn't horrible as what season 3 turned out. Only because I missed some Kugi-chan action did I opt to watch this now, and was nowhere near where season 2 left. Season 3 was all plot-driven, it was all dreadful.\r\nSTORY = 2\r\nYep. Dreadful it is. I took time to read some of the high-rated reviews here and I get their main point: read the light novel, my backside. Read, because that is the original version of the Shakugan no Shana storyline. However, that's just the sameas telling me I should read the entire graphic novel of TheWalkingDead to enjoy its TV adaptation. But AMC and others concerned with the production didn't require us to do so, and the TWD TV version is as brilliant or acclaimed better than its original graphic novel. I could say JC Staff should have done something like that, too, which they didn't.\\n\\n\r\nThis is unexpectedly disappointing, however despite I understand the \"original adaptation\" thingy that Shanatards emphasize, the writer/JC Staff/whoever has the key role here did have three choices:\\n\r\na. they could continue s1 and s2's efforts, solidifying the fans' expectations, nevermind those who had known the light novels;\\n\r\nb. They should have done this \"true adaptation\" back in season 1 so we won't be wasting our time;\\n\r\nc. They can choose to just f*ck this up. Who cares about plot and story? We want the money. They said.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I guess they chose letter C.\\n\r\nThe thing is about the entire SNShana installment, is whoever tried to deviate the animation story from the original should have bet his/her entire money on seeing it through. It's what's proper, it's what should have been done. Thanks to the \"reverting to the original\" efforts, SNShana ended up 100% plot-driven. Characters Yuji and Shana seemed to have ambivalent feelings towards their choices and decisions and still, they chose something their dialogues and scripts didn't state. That goes for the entire cast of characters as well. \\n\r\nPlus, what's worse than a plot-driven story is the \"Deus ex Machina\", and this element is as bountiful as their power of existence had been.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, what I can point out to the story, and sorry to say this, but I'm totally unimpressed and eye-rolling towards the entire \"religious innuendos\". \\n\r\nMost of the side of the Flame Hazes' specifically the Crimson Lords have devilish names such as \"Behemoth\" and \"Alastor\", whereas on the other side constitutes of the \"Trinity\" and the \"god of creation\", and the rapture and the apocalyptic---pah.\\n\r\nIf I had known this was the entire plot of Shana all along, I should have watched this when I yet to age 12, because back then I enjoyed Gundam Wing and Angelic Layer, then I'm pretty sure I could have enjoyed SNShana season 3 very well; because by the time I turned 13, I know I would be focusing on better stories like Gurren Lagann for example. \\n\r\nNow that I'm older, I'm infuriating, and cussing, and pulling some of my hair, and calculating about 10hours of time wasted watching this, and 20hours more of watching both s1 and s2.\\n\\n\r\nShanatards would surely like to see all those explosions and fights, but only a child or a monkey can be fascinated by those, especially if you've spent watching season 1 and 2 with a regard of 7 or 8 rating, the \"reverting-to-the-original season3\" failed to impress even a tiny bit because it ruined the pace of execution of the story. I can assure you that even if this plot is added with the USS Enterprise, the Millennium Falcon, two Gundams, and alchemy, tyrant's eye---none of those will make me think otherwise, because the plot itself is beyond salvage, it's ruined.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART = 10\\n\r\nyes, give this a 10. JC Staff's only good side.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 7\\n\r\nSurely though, Kotoko and Mami Kawada music transmits that Shana-esque vibe, but that can't atone for the damage caused.\\n\r\nAlso, even with Ai Kayano, Yuki Kaji, Marina Inoue and Natsumi Takamori were added on the seiyuu cast, none of them matters. I'm pretty sure that they were overjoyed being casts on SNShana 3, but I can bet you that by the time they finished their voice-recording, they've all realized what a complete waste of time it had been.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERIZATION = 2\\n\r\nThe plot is dreadful, moreso the characterization. With the \"reverting of season 3 to light novel\" as claimed by Shanatards went, the characterizations were all derailed and was cut off from the progress of what season 2 left which resulted to uneven pacing and deus ex machina, and the very fact that no matter what dialogues the characters were delivering, the plot just proceeds on itself, leaving the viewer wondering why and what happened.\\n\r\nFor example, how did Sakai Yuji ever reached the conclusion that the best way to help Shana is to side with the Denizens and the trinity and a new snake-guy never heard of in season 1 and 2? If this is the s1-s2 Yuji, you know that he won't decide on that. But the s3 version of him is just what the author penned him to without a care of what/who he used to.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's worse. Adding too many characters as extras for the \"great war\" proved to be useless, unnecessary and out of context. Because here we know that there were thousands of Flame Hazes as \"merely mentioned\" in season 1, but we caught a glimpse this season 3 that apart from the main and supporting characters, these extra flame hazes are nothing more but salarymen, housewives, and otakus. They couldn't even transform into something else (yes it might be expensive to animate but this is Shana, if they could make a ton of magic circle, they could easily animate anything and anyone else more) and was not even clear if they had their own vessel/crimson lord or they were just wielding swords to look like the part. Then because there were so many extras, everyone should just have to have a screentime of 3mins and needs to die after.\\n\r\nSupporting antagonists also suffered the 3mins-fate, very few died while some others forgot they used to have roles back in season 2 and 1---and whatever happened to Hecate's feelings, all these were a gigantic pile of mess.\\n\\n\r\nAs if the mess wasn't bad enough, some characters suddenly had too much of too many powers/abilities that even if a Gundam, Saitama, Ryuuko, the Jedi council will pass in the middle of their so-called war, you'll certainly not notice them because of the barrage of whatnot powers been already displayed. Of course, the premise goes to that they had these powers inside them for a thousand years or more, but that's a flimsy and childish excuse, too lazy to elaborate and was just all too wonky to convince, unless you're a kid or those who are easily impressed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 1\\n\r\nThis is the first time I ever tried to take breaks upon finishing an episode. Usually I could finish 3-5eps straight; even Glasslip got me about 2eps before breathing out. But here in SNShana s3, I longed for the day to get this thing done, finished, and reviewed here in MAL to warn others that you go waste your time in some anime else. I mean, I watched Tamayura just to ease my mind in this SNShana s3, re-played NFSMW (2005), and listened/discovered more David Bowie songs---all these while dreading that I was about to watch the next episode soon. Now, glad that's over.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 3\\n\r\nThe power of existence of season 3 proved to be like a Ford Fiesta that was placed with a Mustang engine, in which the Ford engineers patted themselves on the back for a job well done, but Ford fans knew better as to what a Fiesta would look like with a V8. If in reality they did do something like this, Ford fans might chase them out with Camaros and Corvettes.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what about a Focus on Mustang V8 engine? Sounds good, eh?\\n\\n\r\nHence, like the analogy of the Focus bridging the Fiesta to the Mustang, this is what I could have strongly suggested on SNShana 3: this could have been a season 4, or a Shana movie that bridges the gap of season 2 to 3, or some OVAs to do just those---anything that can \"bridge\" and \"provide information\" on events that will lead to season 3, not just taking the premise and leaving it out to the viewer's imagiation.\\n\r\nInstead, JC Staff and whoever wrote this proceeded that putting a great war and misaligned characters will be a huge hit, and it will be the greatest epic Shana season ever.\\n\r\nNo it isn't.\\n\r\nA monkey can clap hands on the explosions, kids can cheer on the fights, but to Shana fans (not necessarily Shanatards), this is an insult. We could have started watching season 1 as the \"default, original intended light-novel version\" and I know I'll give this an 8-10 rating; however putting a different s3 from s1 and s2 where Shana and the others' characterizations have been popularized, loved, and respected, this was a disaster in storytelling. Shana and Yuji's and the rest's power of existence were basically disregarded and ripped to be replaced with \"plot-driven characters\" who kept saying craps and pieces to which the plot just took them to what the author decided-- not from the causes and effects of their decisions. Thus, the characters you know from s1 and s2 left their souls on those previous seasons.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: could have been great, if only the storytelling of the season 3 were all made to be parallel and connecting to the previous seasons.",

            "content": "My jaw dropped after seeing the reviews for the season finale, I was really disappointed at the community and this site in general. How can you rate such a well executed and series defining season as anything less than astonishing? \r\nFirst and foremost J.C hired the author to supervise development in order to keep the lore as faithful as possible to the original work. I mean the season was actually canon compared to the bullshit scripts they used in their first two seasons. Perhaps there were a few intricate scenes that weren't added in which the fans were expecting to see but apart from suchgratuities they shouldered the light novel's burden with very few inaccuracies keeping it faithful to the books until the end.\\n\\n\r\nNow most hate originates from the sudden and vast amount of change, and I mean it's so grand that the setting itself is at threat. Tons of new characters were introduced and many returning characters who played previous core roles came back to be sparsely used and receive small insignificant ones such as Yoshida who made little appearance to the exception of the start and end of the series and even then she was vaguely there. Though there may have been many new characters, those new roles added a lot of flavour to the show incorporating many new personalities ranging from the daredevil rebecca reed to the subtle, shy rose shaped cocytus brigid. \\n\\n\r\nApart from all the added characters the two that the series depended and revolved around also underwent change. The protagonist and the heroine or should I say the antagonist and the heroine? At the beginning of the season the boy dotes upon the philosophy of change and what it would accomplish if he were given the strength to change the world and eventually under the influence of the deity Serei no Hebi(voiced by AYAMI SHOW) he takes the task to achieve a better tomorrow for his friends family and loved ones, but to the expense of the girl he loves whom he has to fight against in order to save. At that moment and as we progress through the series we get glimpses at how drastic his personality has shifted from a scared boy who let the surprise of the moment swing his mood to a daunting young man incorporated with the traits and charisma of the Snake. This was what I think J.C struggled the most with, shaping Yuji's character to one that represents his ideal self influenced by his decision to change, and the half shared by the deity. Though they are the same entity they both have distinct voice actors, one that portrays the newly reformed Sakai Yuji and the other that reflects the snake's wisdom.(Who can do a better job than AYAMI SHOW for an immortal badass snake that has lived for over a millennium?) Although they've never contradicted the other the two are easily seen as different individuals who can be distinguished even if they bore the same voice. Despite Yuji's polar change at the start of the season he also grows on certain occasions where he's given the opportunity to confront his old classmates he left behind giving a thorough speech to them on his motives and reasoning behind fighting against what they perceived as good and clearing any misconceptions the viewers may have formerly had.\\n\\n\r\nAs Sakai Yuji develops a more complex character the same can be said alongside the heroine Shana who struggles against her own insecurities the first half of the season and turns into a fine dependable young woman the next. Her personality at the start is a port from the second season as she slowly realizes her own true nature and strength which she later demonstrates against Sakai Yuji who defeated her in Misaki city. Following her defeat she learned to quell the emotions and feelings she couldn't answer and confessed to him when they met proving her own desire to change that rivalled that of Yuji's actions. Shana's change wasn't as notable as the Prota/anta but it was without a doubt more character development in 10 episodes than what you would see in 100 naruto episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWell it's true that the season lacked in the harem department but the scenes involving Shana and Yuji confessing their ideals to each other and how they fought for a better future together were more emotionally involving than the entirety of the second season. I fail to see how some found the season boring, I obviously don't share in your opinion since I remember the great deal of satisfaction I felt at each episode when the series was still airing and the yearn for episode 12 after episode 11 ended on a cliffhanger and had the next episode delayed for two weeks.\\n",

            "content": "Before reading this please note that:\r\n-This  review will be broken down into two separate reviews, one for the season and one for the overall series\r\n-This review may contain light spoilers\r\n-This review is from the standpoint of a person who loves a good romance anime\r\n**PART 1- THE SEASON**\r\nFor any reason that you are persuaded to not watch this anime, WATCH IT. This season is a direct sequel to the second season to the point where Yuuji has to choose between Shana and Kazumi. But something has gone wrong and Yuuji has disappeared. Then we learn that our main male protaganist is pursuing the role asthe leader of the Bal Masqu\u00e9. I know it sounds a little fishy and it seems that Yuuji has become corrupted but i ensure you that he has his reasons.\\n\\n\r\nStory-10/10\\n\r\nThe story is what makes this season the best season of them all in the Shakugan no shana anime. There are twists and turns. There are sad parts, parts in which you can chuckle at, parts that make you frustrated, and parts that you will remember for the rest of your life. The whole thing about Yuuji and the Bal Masque is confusing and makes you want to punch Yuuji through the computer monitor but it is well put together and i applaud an anime with plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9/10\\n\r\nI believe that i seen the same animations and quality of art through the 3 seasons (roughly 5 years) which is great but i would think that it could had changed for the better for a 2011 anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10/10\\n\r\nI'm almost always not a critic when it comes to sound but the soundtrack was AWESOME! and the English voice actors where great (like always).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-7/10\\n\r\nI believe that this season added too much characters and gives back-stories for too much of them but then again the whole 3rd season is about a giant war. Still the character of Shana always impresses me, i believe that she is a very 3-d character meaning she has outside personalities like being harsh, but in the inside she has hidden romantic feelings and leadership qualities. Yuuji on the other hand i didn't really like until this season because i think he was indecisive at times and did things that went against Shana. This season Yuuji redeemed himself stating that the reason why he does what he does is for the people that he loves, like Shana. And then that whole thing about Margery and Keisaku is really great. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10/10\\n\r\nCredit the amazing ending for the enjoyment because this season is just basically a giant cat and mouse game. Seasons one and two had a mix between comedy, romance, action, and school life. But war and romance are the only two themes in this season. Which is great for those who has came to this anime for romance (like myself) but not so great for the people who came to this anime for the sole purpose of action. Meaning that the battles were not that great like a Dragon ball battle or a Naruto battle. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-10/10\\n\r\nThis anime quickly shot up to one of my favorites of all time almost everything was spot on, the errors and bad things about this anime was quickly overshadowed by the all of the great things. \\n\\n\\n\r\n**PART 2- THE SERIES**\\n\r\nOh it's been a hell of a ride through almost 80 episodes and there was a great payoff. Seriously Shakugan no Shana was a anime that had me quite surprised but i guess i should had knew it was good because it shared a lot of the themes from the familiar of zero which is up there as one of my favorites. This is one of those anime in which your not going to be moved by it like a Clannad but you are going to deeply enjoy it and cherish the memories of watching it for as long as you live because i know i will.",

            "content": "Not gonna lie. I was excited beyond belief to start this show. And just the start of episode one, i asked my self \"Is this even the same studio?\" I then decided to give the show a chance. Kept watching and I'm not gonna lie, I started to like this to an extent. Then when I began to get excited it was just killed. \r\nSPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT!!!\r\nThen this entire thing lost me. We go through episodes at a time of this battle, watch multiple people die, then Phele shows up(DAMNIT Why didn't Yoshida die D: thanks for ruining that too.) And then after allthat, they still fail to accomplish their objective, and they then are all fine with it? I don't even understand why they resisted in the first place. I actually refuse to acknowledge this season.\\n\\n\r\nNow that that's out of my system, I will quickly cover the rest.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Art: I don't know about everyone else, but it's the same as Season 2/1(Although, the music in this seemed way more epic). In short, i left sound and art at an 8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Well i honestly thought that really no characters BUT the God of Creation made any sense in this season. Everyone else sorta just dramatically acts without making any sense. I dropped this to a 6.\\n\\n\r\nNow I usually calculate my overall by Grouping Art & Sound, Story, Character and enjoyment Twice as an average(Unless, like in this case, I feel the overall Wouldn't reflect how i feel it was). This Season was disappointing enough I didn't even calculate it, and just put a 4 for the overall. \\n\\n\r\nLong story short, If you are excited to see Season 3, well don't keep your hopes high.",

            "content": "The final series, of the Shakugan No Shana story. I personally found this one the best out of the 3, plenty of action, romance mainly focus on Yuji and Shana not that bitch Kazumi. Some people say that the 3rd series lacked romance compare to the other 2, i strongly disagree, Shakugan no Shana II almost half of the series was all useless fan service, the only bit of romance was probably the end. I admit that the 1st one probably had more romance compare to the 3rd one, but the 1st one had significantly less fights than the 3rd one.\r\nStory 9\r\nThe must unexpected twistin a story i had ever seen, never in a million years did i think that Yuji will join up with BM (Bal Masque) and fight against the FH (flame haze). Yuji  who had the God of creations, Sairei no Hebi in him, wanted to free shana from the destiny of the flame haze, a never ending fight against the tomogara. The fights between Yuji and Shana led to romance development between them which was pretty nice to watch and enjoy, Yuji FINALLY chooses a girl after 50 episodes... Season 3 is basically a war between the Tomogara and the Flame haze, Yuji who wanted to create a world for the Tomogara, meaning they will all leave the current world and flame haze wouldn't fight anymore, at the start I was thinking \"great thats good, finally peace\" so i was VERY confused on why the flame haze continued to fight even though Yuji's action will lead to peace, after rewatching those episodes several times i realised that the Flame Haze was fighting for the future while Tomogara was fighting for the present, that was the only difference. If we were playing a game, you can call the ending a \"good end\" like its literally a good end with no bad outcomes and everyones happy, very first time witnessing one. I found this ending to be absolutely amazing, even rewatching just the last 5 mins a hundred times, i still get emotional at Shana and Yuji's talk =P.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8 \\n\\n\r\nYuji's new look is pretty badass, he looks like a true villain. Most of the character design didn't really change, everybody still looks the same but i guess they can't really change much considering their clothes are part of their weapons. I think the animation of the massive fight scenes were pretty well done, most the FH looked different, but for the tomogara, you can see the same one like 10 times they didn't really put much effort in it, but i guess it'll be hard to come up with loads of unique monster designs. The new characters were also quite good as well, with the new tomogara design weird as ever and monstery like and the new flame haze well, there all very different and their clothes really match their personality.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8\\n\\n\r\nThe opening songs is as amazing as ever, even after listening to them probably about a hundred times on youtube and on my phone I'm still not bored of it. The ost is quite well done, i especially like the one in the ending, a nice slow piano theme while Yuji and Shana is talking about their relationship. The fight OST is pretty good as well. The ending songs is also as amazing as ever, i especially like what they do now where they have part of the ending song playing just before the end of the episode, for me it kinda created a cliffhanger feeling making me want to watch more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9 \\n\\n\r\nIt really is amazing to see how much Shana has changed, from a complete Tsundere into someone who can freely express her feelings but i do love the bit in the end where she uses Urusai x3 again at that point i was just thinking \"YAY shes back woooo!'. In this season she's more open towards all the character and it soon becomes clear that because of this  it has affected everyone else as well especially Wilhelmina, at the start she refused to recognise Shana as a flame haze due to Shana's feeling, but now after 2 seasons she finally accepts Shana. Plus I think she became more soft, and more opening as well. In the past 2 season's Yuji was pretty predictable, you knew what he was doing and their was nothing mysterious about him, That all changed in season 3, He became a character that is the complete opposite, and in a way Shana became more like what Yuji was before. This was actually kinda fun to enjoy for me, for Yuji who was always following Shana to actually oppose her feels like he finally became a man, but i know a lot of viewers who disliked the fact that they fight. One thing i am especially happy about is Kazumi finally being out of this love triangle, no more obstacle's between Shana and Yuji or so i thought... The introduction of new and old flame hazes/tomogara was pretty good, it shows just how large the armies of both sides was. Love seeing Khamsin again and Rebecca was a pretty interesting new character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9 \\n\\n\r\nThis anime was probably about 70% fight scenes, with about 20% romance, the fight scenes was very enjoyable to watch, the plans that the FH came up with, the sacrifices that occur. Although the comedy factor of this anime was gone, I found the new relationship developments between Yuji and Shana very enjoyable to watch, each scene was very heartwarming. I liked the story of season 3 the most, it finally felt like that story was going somewhere, in the last 2 seasons it was always the same, Bal Masque did something Flame haze stopped them. Which probably made it quite enjoyable to watch for me. Best bits of the anime was probably when Yuji's tells of his plan, and the ending. The ending is just.... words can't describe it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall I didn't think the story was lacking anywhere probably except for some character design of the minions of Tomogara, but its not a big deal, the Story is better than the other 2 although the romance was lacking but it still had more than season 2. What i found pretty amazing is the character relationships and how much it developed. The opening and ending songs still top notch. The Shakugan No Shana series is a must watch, all 3 seasons is really good in my opinion, if your a fan of Action, Romance anime then i think Shakugan no Shana is definitely for you, also with 70 something episodes you probably won't be bored for a while or at least a week =P. For people who says omg i want season 4, its not gonna happen the light novel finished so URUSA!I, URUSAI!!, URUSAI!!!!",

            "content": "After waiting three seemingly long years without even an assurance of it getting an animation again, the sequel or rather the finale of one of the most famous series in the anime world is finally here.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nAs the ending of the last season was so much of a cliffhanger, we are all wondering what happened after that. To my surprise, there\u2019s even a shocking revelation right off the very first episode. It just shows the different new storyline and plot this series has to offer for this finale. There\u2019s a major twist in the story this time because of anapparent major switching of sides of one of the main characters. It is really confusing but it\u2019s just to make the revelations at the end anticipating. A full force war is always a perfect storyline for endings. And if we\u2019re talking about war, it\u2019s always about a battle of beliefs. Who\u2019s right or wrong? What is the true peace? Whose belief will prevail at the end? As always, this series loves to use interesting yet quite confusing terminologies or names for its characters. Some terms are interesting and cool but some are quite mess-up and don\u2019t even matches to the character\u2019s personality and ability. However, I am going to admit that most of the dialogues and lines are really confusing.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nFor a new season and for a finale, there are quite a number of new characters both from protagonists\u2019 and antagonists\u2019 side. Sakai Yuji has always been the type of character with an impressive improvement. From being a weak and tiny torch, he became quite a capable fighter that even Alastor was in awe. However, this time around his character development is rather more of a shocking character development which is so unexpected. Personally, I don\u2019t even particularly like him because he can really become quite irritating but in this finale, he\u2019s not only extremely irritating but he\u2019s also really confusing.  You will see Shana\u2019s abilities like you\u2019ve never seen it before. There are few new interesting techniques.  I\u2019ve always wanted for Shana and Yuji\u2019s love story to really have a development because in the last previous seasons, it was quite in a slow pace but this is so far from what I imagine it to be. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION\\n\r\nOne of the amazing things when there\u2019s quite a gap between the previous season and the sequel is the improvement with its animation. There\u2019s non-stop explosive action from start to finish, befitting the ending of one of the most successful action-fantasy series in the anime world.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI don\u2019t find making Yuji a villain and making him fight Shana interesting. It surprises me, not in a good way. Yuji sides with the enemies because he wants to protect Shana and the people he loves. But Shana thinks differently. I know that the kind of drama that comes with that kind of storyline is very common today because it\u2019s still very much effective. Making best friends or lovers go against each other particularly in series with wars at the end is really effective because it is really interesting to see characters that are once ally\u2019s ends up becoming enemies because of their different beliefs. However, it just doesn\u2019t feel right this time. After all the battle that Yuji and Shana had been through at the end Yuji sided with the enemies and fight Shana! At the end it just turns out that all of them want the same thing. Then what\u2019s the point on making the villains so effective. I feel so irritated almost the entire time I am watching this.\\n\\n\r\nI know that because this is the finale, they are going for a different and more dramatic kind of storyline and love story but it just doesn\u2019t work for me. It is so far-fetched and so over the top.\\n",

            "content": "I'm listening to Koubou, by Kawada Mami, around half an hour past the ending of Shakugan No Shana Final. During the last couple days I begun watching the series, got caught in it's pace, and finally finished it. Rather than speaking only of the third season this review is for the whole series as that makes more sense for me.\r\nShakugan no Shana, to me, is a coming of age story smashed up with romance and lots of fantasy, or perhaps I should say romance smashed with coming of age. Regardless of that the series revolves around questions such as \"what path should I follow\" \"Whoam I?\" and \"Do I love?\" which, in contrast to the flashy animation and unrealistic setting, feel rather off time to time. \\n\r\nShakugan No Shana doesn't gave a very complicated setting. Parallel to world of humans exists the world of Guze, from which Guze no Tomogara also called Crimson Denizen, traveled to the world of humans. Being existences foreign to the world of men these creatures soon notice that they can't continue existing like they used to without ample supply of power of existence, which conveniently can be gained by devouring the existence of humans. However, some of the Tomogara soon notice that the devouring causes interference in the balance of the world. Aiming to secure the balance of the world they contract themselves with humans, creating an existence called Flame Haze, and hunt for their kind that disturb the balance. \\n\\n\r\nThe series protagonist, Flame Haze contracted to the Flame of Heaven Alastor, named Shana (after her sword Nieto No Shana) by Sakai Yuji, is a young looking girl with dark hair and eyes. When she battles her eyes and hair lit with flames and she wears a long leather cloak. \\n\r\nThe series male protagonist Sakai Yuji is an ordinary kid who gets pulled in to the world of Flame Haze and Tomogara by chance, which he later describes as fate. \\n\r\nUnder the surface Sakai and Shana are very similar characters, in sense of both development and characteristics. Both characters start of with solid footing, find themselves confused with events and feelings they don't understand, look for their own road to cope and finally arrive to conclusion. \\n\r\nLarge amount of the series rotates around the interactions of Shana and Yuji. Due to this nature whether one will enjoy the series or not comes down to connecting with the feelings of the characters. \\n\r\nTime to time I found myself irritated with the shallow feeling the series left. It could be because of the highly unrealistic setting, the art style which didn't really fit the mentality sometimes or simply because the characters didn't feel consistently genuine, but the series certainly lacked something. One major fact for me was that after the ending climax I felt like the conclusion could have been reached in much easier way. Like most of the series was pointless. \\n\r\nThen again life isn't always that easy. Sometimes things just have to be done. And in sense that's one of the points the series is trying to drive in. That love and life all full of bumps that may seem like they are ridiculous or not realistic, that there are events that should not happen yet happen, in sense that's what it's all about isn't it. Because if everything was logical and reasonable we would call them facts not feelings right?\\n\r\nShakugan No Shana is story wise lot about giving it a chance and stepping into the characters. If you keep thinking about what is plausible and what is not you will evidently miss what you could claim by rather accepting \"this is what is happening\" and then proceeding to consider the series from there on. Because albeit feeling shallow and try-hard at times Shakugan No Shana has the moments that will just leave you overflowing with emotions.\\n\\n\r\nThe series has very beautiful visuals. The scenery looks amazing from individuals to landscapes, characters are stunning, battles look great and rather than feeling like tricks are used to achieve things the series consistently delivers from beginning to end. \\n\r\nThe series has a very styled and generic anime feel to it having everything from big eyes to  clothes teared in implicate way. \\n\r\nOne of the best parts of the show are the various different special skills the Flame haze and Tomagara use in battle, rendered in visually stunning fashion with little competition. Music wise the series is solid with vocals that emphasize the story and acoustics that help build appropriate mood. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all I feel bit confused with Shakugan no Shana. In the end when I evaluate it it's nothing that special, yet the fact also remains that I feel very satisfied with the series. I suppose in the end the feeling invoked by the ending scene is worth more than any analysis of the characters or plot could be, and every viewer will have to see it for themselves.",

At first, I thought it was very well done and some really endgame kind of material that would wrap the series up very nicely, but then I realized something.\r\nFor the entire season, the two main characters, Yuji and Shana, are fighting FOR NO DAMN REASON AT ALL. This made me very mad and I found myself justrushing through the anime just to see how it ended.\\n\r\nThe ending of this anime was heavily disappointing and the writer really should have just made and episode 25 on S2 or an OVA. This season basically did nothing and accomplished nothing. I hated this and I would not even try watching this season, and I'm sorry if you had to watch S2, because that was just complete and utter garbage, just like this season.",

            "content": "After having watched the first two seasons of Shakugan no Shana, it was safe to say I became an avid fan of Shana. So, of course, I had hopes for it\u2019s third and final season. Having noticed the third season received more poor reception than it\u2019s predecessors, my hopes dropped down. However, I still kept going, thinking I could make it work.\r\nI couldn\u2019t make it work.\r\nStory/Narrative - Final starts us off right where the second season left us, or rather the aftermath of the second season\u2019s cliffhanger. Yuji seems to have disappeared right before he was able to choose between Yoshida and Shana, and nowthe rest of the cast is trying to confirm his status and where he is. However, this is only for the first few episodes, afterwards, we get the sudden plot development that the reason Yuji was gone was because he formed a contract with a being known as the Snake of the Festival or the God of Creation. This wouldn\u2019t be as bad if this God of Creation wasn\u2019t the leader of our main cast\u2019s antagonistic team whose plans they been thwarting for the past two seasons, Bal Masqu\u00e9. With this sudden realization, Shana and the gang must now oppose the person they once knew, Yuji Sakai.\\n\\n\r\nShakugan no Shana Final\u2019s plot can be described in one word: rushed. Right from the beginning of the season, we get the abrupt development that Yuji is no longer the Yuji that was slowly and carefully developed throughout in the past two seasons, he is now a completely new character with new mindsets and goals. How Yuji met the Snake of the Festival and agreed to his contract affirmatively is never thoroughly explained, or explained at all. This isn\u2019t the only time the series doesn\u2019t explain things, though, throughout the entire duration of the season important plot points that would be convenient with understanding the story and what's going on are either just casually brought up once, or never even shined upon. Now, this wouldn\u2019t be as bad if there was at least enough context to make it ambiguous to the viewers, but there isn\u2019t. Sudden changes in plot development are inevitable because of this, making them only work as a form of shock value and nothing else. Furthermore, towards the end of the series, Shakugan no Shana realizes it has to have a theme and it cops this out by having an extremely trite, and dare I say cringey one. The ending completely leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth as it feels like it\u2019s disregarding some of the themes presented in the previous seasons and aiming for a more out of character ending. The only redeemable thing about Shakugan no Shana Final\u2019s plot is that it keeps you mildly entertained as to what\u2019s gonna happen for a while, until it becomes incredibly stretched out and mundane shortly afterward. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- For better or worse, Final has to rush through its characters\u2019 development just like its plot. As stated before, all of Yuji\u2019s character development from the previous seasons is completely disregarded in place for a pretentious antagonist. One would hope that at least some parts of Yuji\u2019s original character would still be intact in his now hollow shell, but nope, he\u2019s no longer Yuji. Shana, completely confused by the sudden development, tries to self-identify herself as always. And, to be perfectly honest, her development is handled rather decently, almost appreciable in fact. If it wasn\u2019t for her having to quickly move along with the plot, she would be one of my favorite characters. Wilhelmina as well is the final character to at least get some decent conclusion to her character, which was nice see considering she was my favorite. Other characters, such as Yoshida and Margery, are put on the bus until the plot absolutely demands them to come back, and completely rushes their development to the point where it\u2019s unnoticeable. It\u2019s also important to note that a significant amount of characters are introduced in this season, such as multiple important Tomogara/Denizens and Flame Hazes. These characters are never fully established upon, they\u2019re just there. Some have implied motivations and goals, but like Final\u2019s plot points, they\u2019re never clearly explained. The pacing skipping most of these characters\u2019 development and characterization completely kills any emotional depth these characters are supposed to have, ruining several sentimental scenes, which this season contains several of. Besides a few handful, most of the characters in Final aren\u2019t ever developed with enough context to ever get to the point past bland. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - Shakugan no Shana isn\u2019t known for having spectacular animation, and this stays true in Final. For an anime made in 2011, it doesn\u2019t very look \u201cmodern\u201d, looking more like one made in 2007. Although if J.C. Staff did this for the sake of keeping the integrity of it\u2019s previous seasons, I applaud them. The fight scenes, which this season contains a ton of, could have used a bit more budget, but I digress. Shana still has that beautiful Flame Haze hair, and off models aren\u2019t an uncommon occurrence. Final\u2019s animation stayed relatively the same compared to its predecessors. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound- The soundtrack of Shakugan no Shana is reminiscent of it\u2019s previous seasons, meaning there\u2019s not any particular BGM that completely stands out as something one would listen to on it;s own, but do they do fit the mood really well most of the time. As for the OPs and EDs, \u201cLight My Fire\u201d by KOTOKO is my particular favorite, as I feel it completely fits the situations and whatever moods that Final is trying to achieve. The EDs, \u201cOne\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll Believe\u201d by ALTIMA are also pretty good, as they fade into the last few seconds of every episode they\u2019re in as an attempt to try to hype up the next episode. As for the seiyuu, they do a good job voicing their characters as always, but I really gotta hand it down to Rie Kugimiya as Shana for nailing the impact of some of her lines, really great job there. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Entering with high expectations, I tried to enjoy Final as much as I could, despite how bad it started. Once I realized that it had a bit of a big downfall, I was disappointed, which definitely clouded my enjoyment of the show. I never really wanted an episode to end, but I never really felt a need to watch the next one, albeit in the beginning I had some aspirations for the show to get better, but that never came, making the rest of Final a rather mundane experience that was just there to waste 24 minutes. 5/10 \\n\\n\r\nOverall- Shakugan no Shana Final is a disappointment. It\u2019s clearly trying to achieve something with it\u2019s significant cast of characters and big 180 plot, but it completely fails in doing so by trying to fit so much into just 24 episodes. In return for the development of a handful of characters, Final has to discard the complete development of a couple characters and not explain several character actions and plot points. Shana fans should beware of Final\u2019s flaws when watching it. People who have previously hated the past two seasons might find comedic value in the complete trainwreck that Final brings. And, as for people who just want to finish the Shana trilogy\u2026 well, the ending results are decent. Someone please tell me if the light novels at least did a better job... 4/10",

            "content": "Story - 6:\r\nRather than starting exactly where we left off in Shakugan no Shana II, Shakugan no Shana III takes place a while after the events of its prequel, though it's been about a year since the start of the entire series.\r\nWe find out that Yuji chose neither of his love interests; not Yoshida nor Shana, having disappeared the night he was to meet one of them. We soon find out why; the reason that makes this story truly unique: the hero has become the villain.\r\nI've never seen anything like this in an anime, nor can I recall seeing it in anything I've seen orread or in any video games I've played. It's an interesting twist, one which quickly draws you in. Our former protagonist, current antagonist fighting against the girl he loves, and all the while, you're wondering whether or not this is actually what he wants, or if he is under some sort of mind control.\\n\r\nUnlike previous seasons, anyone interested in this season should know that it doesn't focus on romance as much as the previous ones. Well, it does, but it's hard to develop romantic relations when you're fighting against your only love interest, so don't expect much. They are already in love, so it's more of a matter of trying to convince each other to join the other side.\\n\r\nI must say that the series, while twenty-four episodes, seems to drag on at a very slow pace. It seems like two days go by over a period of ten episodes, and that most episodes seem to just be fighting scenes, albeit with conversation going on the midst of it. It's either talk, fight, or flashback, talk fight or flashback, and the fighting especially can cause you to lose interest. While the talking can be boring at times, it can also get interesting, especially ones between the to main characters, Yuji and Shana, though it can get somewhat repetitive after a while. Still, if you stick with the plot, it's worth watching, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7: \\n\r\nThe artwork, as usual, is very good. The humanoid characters are all drawn well, though as usual, an aspect of it annoys me. This is one of those anime where the characters never change clothing. While some anime, mainly ones where the characters have to where school uniforms everyday or have little resources, can get away with it, this one has a hard time doing so. While it's not a huge aspect that takes away from the series, it always sticks out to me. Not to mention Wilhelmina's out of place maid outfit and Shana's tendency to wear her school uniform even though she doesn't go to school anymore.\\n\r\nIn addition to our regular anime characters, humans and all that, there are a lot of Tomogara, demon-like creatures, this season, and while some of the main ones are humanoid in form, others [especially insignificant extras] are demonic looking. One eye, reptilian-looking. There is a large variety in the appearance of the Tomogara, and it's interesting to see.\\n\r\nThe Serpent of the Ritual, especially, proves to have an abnormal form, and looks more three dimensional and computer generated than other characters, causing it to stick out, as it's no doubt supposed to. It looks somewhat out of place, but it works, to an extent.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7: \\n\r\nAs usual, the opening and endings are by Mami Kawada and KOTOKO, this time with the addition of ALTIMA, which performed the first OP.\\n\r\nSongs throughout the show are often repeated, especially at climactic parts, and while it works, it wouldn't have hurt to include some different songs. They only seemed to do this in the last episode, where they brought back the second season OP near the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6:\\n\r\nWhile Yuji's character change is interesting, it's also doubtlessly abrupt. Character relations are interesting, for lack of a better word, but I feel some are left with poor conclusions, not giving enough closure. There were great new characters, but we seemed to lose track of them all, and their fates were vague in description or intent.\\n\r\nWe seemed to be focusing on so many different characters at once that we never really get to know them all that well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8:\\n\r\nWhile elements were overall less than stellar, this series will always have a special place in my heart, and I kept with it no matter what. I laughed, I cried; I lived, I loved (okay, so maybe not the last one). I feel like most fans of the series will enjoy it, but not if you're the kind of person who is only in it for the romance. If that's the case, then you shouldn't bother with the series at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6: \\n\r\nShakugan no Shana, while enjoyable, has always been a fairly good series, but nothing epic. I enjoy it, as always, but if looking at it from an unbiased point of view, enjoyment and emotional attachment aside, I can only give it a six. Worth watching, but not something I'm going to add to my favorites. A great experience that I highly recommend for any fans of the series who aren't just in it for the romance. While it might not be the best series, you'll likely enjoy it.",

I was happy with the way that the characters were developing and the action scenes were quite satisfying. And if it ain't broke- never mind, that's not even close to what happened. This season would have been fine if it had progressed like the other seasons. Unfortunately that is not what happened. \r\nIn one phrase: WTF just happened?\r\nStory*2: 4\r\nThe story was quite poor because of the fact that Yuuji flipped sides. Why? And since the whole season revolved around that, the story turnedout with a lot of why? The story did have some plot holes, but not gaping ones. No GOOD plot twists, but the story was still decent. The battle scenes were somewhat fun, and because of that, I give it a 4 instead of a 2. But if you liked the whole \"half heart betrayal\" thing, this category could be a 9 for you. But the majority did not, and a 5 it is.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound*.5:  8.5 Not too concerned about this stuff, nothing out of the0+ ordinary. Fairly good art and better than average sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters*1.5: 6.5\\n\r\nEveryone acted accordingly-that is, except Yujii. I would have accepted his flip had there been some foresight or some sign he did not support what Shana did. But Yujii wanted to protect Shana so he could fight with her, not against her. The other characters were amazing and managed to bring this grade up a significant amount.\\n\\n\r\nStaying True to Genre/Show*1.5: 6.5\\n\r\nFairly important with this kind of genre, although not critical. Action was definitely there and it was pretty good. The romance, however, I did not find very good(at least for first part of season) and it lacked the true romance scenes.\\n\\n\r\nPazazz!*.5: 3\\n\r\nNot a critical part of this show, thank God, because there is not much of it. Or rather, there is attempt at it, but it fell flat in absolute. They managed to go lower than neutral by having plot twists that were less then enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment*1: 3\\n\r\n I could not even laugh about how much I didn't understand it, or how bad the plot twists were. There were some cool moments,(couldn't really enjoy them because I didn't understand what was going on) however, and that raises the score a bit; but the bad still far outweighs the good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.17 \\n\r\nI don't recommend this season. Just pretend at the end of the second season \\n\r\neveryone lived happily ever after.",

            "content": "Either your are going to like it, or not. Reason being is that the first 2 seasons focused more on character development, and hence we all get the feeling this is going to be some love romance like Zero no Tsukaima (ZnT anime is bad. You should feel bad if you enjoyed it) with a little bit of story. Season 3 is plot driven, so the people who liked the character development/romance aspect of it won't enjoy season 3 (but will watch it regardless like everyone else).\r\nI liked how everything in SnS radically changed, like season 1 and 2 were just a build up forthis (but it didn't because JC Staff sucks at adapting light novels just like Index 1&2). Visuals were nicer than season 2, at least their eyes weren't covering 65% of their face. \\n\\n\r\nDidn't like how it was compressed to 24 episodes. It does fit the quota of how the last 2 seasons were, but a lot was missed out on characters, their history, and their importance of their existance (especially the Bal Masqu\u00e9 party). Also ending wasn't as I expected. Sort of wanted a Snake of the Festival monologue to finish it off.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the story and character, art and sound is your average JC Staff stuff so you know what to expect (hayate, hidan, last 2 seasons).",

            "content": "After enjoying the first two seasons a lot I expected the final season to be just as good as the first two, more or less. However I was very disappointed after watching it. Shakugan no Shana Final decided to change things up and it didn't work out. Now there are some things that the show still maintained to the previous seasons that are present, so not everything is THAT bad.\r\nStory:4\r\nShakugan no Shana always did a good job balancing out the romance with the action. In season 3 they focused nearly everything on the story and this pissed me off a lot. So basically the storyis Yuji is working with the denisins in order to create a world solely for them so they won't need to consume humans anymore. Yuji is also taken over by the denisins' master known as the snake of festivals and chose this by his own will. Obviously the flame hazes don't agree with this and end up in war for the entire season. \\n\r\nOk why is Yuji working with the denisins all of a sudden and why would he willingly let their master take over his body? Why wasn't any of this whole \"create a new world\" talked about in the previous seasons? Why are they making the denisins seem like they were innocent throughout the season? I don't know. But those are some pretty big flaws. Another thing I disliked is that the entire season is focused on them at war, and it gets old pretty quick. \\n\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nOk, if there is one thing season 3 did right was that it continued to be beatifully animated with its fantastic visuals. The colors really pop and the effects are pretty damn good. \\n\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\r\nAnother thing season 3 did right was its soundtrack. The music is just as good as it has been with a fair amount of good tracks. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:3\\n\r\nOk, this is where I really get mad at this season. Yuji is absolutely ruined. All the development given to him from the first two seasons is gone and he feels like a brand new character, and an unlikable one at that. This might just be my biggest problem with the season. And this is coming from someone who thought he was only ok in the first two seasons. I thought he was fine. I didn't love him, but I didn't hate him. However I despise him in this season, I just hate him.\\n\r\nAnother problem is because they're at war they introduce us to so many characters almost all at once, which is never good. For the new characters I mostly thought they were meh, except a couple I ended up liking. Also because this is entirely focusing on the denisins and the flame hazes, you won't be seeing a lot of the humans in this show, which was another problem.\\n\r\nNow I actually did enjoy the returning characters in this season like Margary, Yoshida, and Shana. They continued to have their character develop and I thought they did a good job with it. But because there are so many new characters and Yuji is terrible I could only give this a 3.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:3\\n\r\nAs the season went on I grew bored of the constant action scenes, even if there were some epic moments here and there. It had few funny moments but just made me wish they followed the same formula as seasons 1 and 2. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:4\\n\r\nShakugan no Shana tried to do something new with the franchise and it DID NOT turn out good. It failed to balance out the romance and action, focused way too much on the story, ruined the main male protagonist, questionable story line, and had too many characters. Even if the animation is fantastic, the soundtrack is pretty good, and the returning characters, excluding Yuji, were still good, the season just disappointed me. They should have just stuck with the same formula as the first two seasons.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Summary: This was an excellent ending to an excellent series! Though there were some plot points I didn't quite understand (perhaps there were easier ways to get to the ending), that didn't retract from my enjoyment. I will say that the 3rd season is a big departure from the other 2 seasons and it is darker, more complex/mature and introduces many new characters and plot points. I thought this departure was refreshing and helped captivate me for the last 24 episodes of a fairly long series.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nIronically this is one of the weaker aspects of this season. I won't go into spoilers but I willsay that there are tons of new characters added, and keeping track of each of them, their motivations, and the overall arc of the story can get a bit complex. The \"good\" and \"bad\" guys blended together far more this season and by the end it was hard to really tell who was right and who was wrong, which I think was a good thing. I REALLY enjoyed how this felt more like 2 sides struggling to achieve a goal without necessarily a good/evil though the \"monsters\" were likely the supposed bad guys I found myself rooting for those same bad guys for more than half of this season. If you're willing to focus and pay close attention (and perhaps rewatch a bit) the story is solid and has interesting twists and turns.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nNothing different from the prior iterations. The art is good. Nothing amazing but definitely good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nAgain similar to prior seasons. The opening and ending themes are great (as usual) though there aren't as many memorable songs during this season as during the 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThis is where this show blows it out of the water. When you can't tell who the \"bad\" guys are and everyone comes across relatable and sympathetic you know the character development is amazing. Granted the story allows for this but I truly enjoyed getting to know each of the characters. Yuuji and Shana were both given a bunch of development, but you also learn a lot more about many key Flame Haze and Bel Masque members. There are a few characters who don't get a deep development but I found this OK because it left more room for intense fighting and more time to focus on the characters you've been building up a relationship with since the earlier seasons.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI got a ton of enjoyment from this series (and this season in particular). The fact that they went outside of the box seemed to disappoint a few of the fans but not me. I think this departure helped keep the series fresh while pushing through to what I consider a strong and satisfying ending.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nThe story had confusing moments, and the art and sound were similar to other seasons but where this REALLY stood out was the character development. I truly cared for each of the major characters (both \"good\" and \"bad\") and this is the first anime in a while where I was able to understand both sides and feel like everyone was fighting their hardest for their own beliefs and there wasn't \"good\" and \"evil\" but just differing and justified goals. I strongly suggest this season (and in fact the entire series) to anyone looking for a solid fighting/romance anime with a good deal of emotional impact.",

            "content": "After seeing the very entertaining season 2 I had high hopes for the final. Well it was a dream but nothing less than a nightmare.\r\nStory: \r\nNot only it's confusing and never really gives any answers, it almost annihilates the previous seasons. Almost nothing your learned does matter anymore because all they do, is either prepare for a fight or they're fighting. In the end you might have to fight as well but against boredom. New Characters are introduced left and right, so sometimes I couldn't even say which side they actually are. The end is neither revealing nor satisfying. If you watch the first andthe last episode you don't miss much IMO.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nAbout the same as it was. No complain here.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nGood as before and basically saves it from being a total disaster.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is the real drama of Final. The carefully built characters and relations are thrown in the trash. Besides Shana accepting that she loves Yuuji all other relationships are meaningless and Shana does only fight anyways. Kazumi loves Yuuji? You can't really tell. All other school colleagues are more or less gone and have no impact on the story. And finally Yuuji. The character you probably cared about in the first seasons: is gone! Nothing he did matters anymore. His training with Shana, well forget it. The new Yuuji/god combination is now the enemy and just annoying. Overall I could not connect to any of the cast that I liked so much before. There's simply no logic in their behaviour and nothing made sense from the beginning to the end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe whole season was torture for me. Seeing how they destroyed everything they built in former seasons was painful. A bad start, boring never ending fighting and a dull end. The series made a u-turn which I couldn't follow. I honestly envy all the people who enjoyed this. I really (\u307b\u3093\u3068) wanted to like it but as I didn't care for the story, the cast and most of all didn't laugh or even smile once, I just couldn't. Final killed Shakugan no Shana.",

            "content": "If you stumble at this review and thinking whether you should watch this anime or not, I hope my review will encourage you to watch this show. This review is also applicable to season 1 and 2.   \r\nShakugan no Shana (SnS), its a pretty much old anime, from the first generation of romance action with tsundere heroine animes era along with Zero no Tsukaima. While it was cliche at first glance, actually SnS contains more than it looks. If you look about the fight, SnS have pretty good fighting scene. It not the best but moderate as it not just scream and wintype of fight. However the selling point of this anime is not about the fight but the conflict between character and this is what SnS excel most. The character\u2019s personality and character development is the true gem of SnS. As the character pass each hurdle, they grow and become stronger not only physically, but also mind which makes them more like able.\\n\\n\r\nThe male protagonist of this series at first seems like weak, beta, and annoying type. The heroine is also no better than some typical snob tsundere. However, as they fight their enemies, they become aware about each other and become closer. Shana know Yuuji desires to become strong and his kindness, Yuuji know Shana cute trait and decided to protect her and make her suffer no longer as flame haze. This is one important thing because, in most common anime, the male protagonist is always straight and if lost or wrong, it will get fixed immediately as the heroine comfort him. However, in this anime, it is not applicable as it become the obstacle itself for the heroine. Their clash of mind is not simple and you can't even know which one is right and which one is wrong. You can sympathize with the heroine (Shana), but you can not blame Yuuji for doing that. Basically, they do it for each other and it is what makes their conflict complicated and spice up the story. In the other hand, to fully understanding their action and reasons behind it, you need to put your place in their position, since it was not stated explicitly. For those who like to dig deeper, SnS is a good choice. In fact, story like this is my favorite because it gives lingering feeling after you finished watching it and not easily forgotten. SnS is one of the anime that actually have true ending and the ending is good, it has bitter sweet feeling and warms your hearts. I almost lost count how many times I opened episode 24 just to watch the last scene and smile while watching it. The songs is perfect, how the ending song makes transition at each of episode\u2019s last scene is perfect. It blends perfectly and makes you excited. The composition is just perfect for the  that kind of scene and genre.  While SnS not shine brightly like other animes, it has its own charm. SnS may was prosecuted at the past time as generic romance action anime, but if you compare it to nowadays kind of romance anime, I will say that SnS excel them all. First, SnS have unique plot, second, SnS has true ending, third, it has deep and complicated plot that you hardly find in nowadays anime.    \\n\r\nYou may finish SnS and then watch another anime, but it may resurface in one of your free time and you think \u201cAh, I have watched a good anime back then. It was time well spent\u201d You may forget it but you can not erase it as it becomes one of your good memories. If you want to have good memories and collection, SnS is your choice. \\n",

            "content": "Now to be honest, this is my first review on any anime. It's one of my first animes, to point out, so accept my apology for doing any mistakes or giving too much talk about this exact series as a whole, and as Season 3 itself. Be aware there might be minor spoilers.\r\nStory\r\nI want to start from the story. In the beginning you get a really great introduction on what is going to happen. When I first started the anime, I didn't expect much due to the fact I was feeling worthless already from watching my previous anime. However, this got me attached more thanyou could imagine. I finished the first season faster than I thought, it got me attached immediately. I went right ahead to download the Season 2, which I couldn't stop watching either. The story was well developed for me, even though at times it was interrupted by side-stories and surrounding impacts, however, it still managed to keep it on it's way. The only thing that was bothering me the whole 2 seasons, was the stupidity of Yuji not able to use his brain to realize that Shana is in love the whole f***ing time with him. However, I loved the first 2 seasons.\\n\r\nNow comes in the 3rd Season... that's where it starts. It just launches you like a rocket into a whole new universe(no kidding). You have no idea how much time has gone through, you have no idea how nor when Yuji became the vessel of The God of Creation. Either way, the Season 3 was a whole season dedicated to fighting, and yet, the development of the story was pretty harsh on my opinion, I had a hard time to understand some of the reasons what happens here and there, regarding some points of the anime. However, it still was a very great experience, because the courage that Shana tries to show in order to save Yuji is just speechless. That's what Season 3 gave me finally. It gave me the love between the two that I was waiting for the whole 2 Seasons. The final episode is what actually gave me the chills. It was something perfect, yet, still not wrapped up. However, it was a great ending, I'm satisfied and I hope, that one day, there will be any anime as great as this one is. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nWell, I guess I don't have much to say about art. This anime is from the big-eyed character ones, it can be quite strange if you watched a more 'realistic' anime, however, after the first few episodes you will completely forget about it and will enjoy the anime as you never imagined.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI have no complains on the sound AT ALL. I loved the soundtrack, it has something to it, the piano parts especially touched me since I play the piano, the soundtrack just fit every part of the anime so well for me, and I'm definitely getting it in my playlist. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nNow this is a bit harder topic. The character development is going throughout the whole 3 seasons, and the changes of the characters can be really seen as you compared all the 3 seasons one after the other. The most character development can be seen for the main characters, however, it's really visible even on the side-characters such as Yoshida, Saito and such, i.e. those that were related to the Crimson World and the fights. Those who been in touch till the end of the anime. \\n\r\nShana, throughout the seasons, gain experience and realize her feelings, and finally gets to find her own path in her life, while at first following the path of a Flame Haze, she finally realizes what is the most important thing in her life, also as Wilhelmina too.\\n\r\nYuji realizes his feelings, and finds his path, and goal, of his life, the most visibly in the Season 3, which is the most crucial and focused on Yuji's goal, accompanied by the war between Denizens and Flame Hazes, and the side-stories, which later get involved into the main story(yes, I'm talking about you, Yoshida, ya silly). In the end, we finally get to the pinnacle of the paths, and goals, that both Shana and Yuji have decided, and they finally find their own path together. This is what I realized through watching the anime, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI can't tell anything else than... it's perfect. It's something special. If I wasn't able to enjoy this enormously well, then this review wouldn't even EXIST. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I have realized that, this anime is not just an anime, it's something special that will leave an impact on your life, you will finally realize something you weren't able before. It did for me, it will for you. If you want an anime that you will be attached to, if you want to see nothing else, but just the anime throughout the time you watch it. If you want to lock in your room for days and watch it non-stop, because you can't stop watching it, well, I have the perfect anime for you! This anime is something different, it has something special I cannot describe, but everytime I hear a song, a word, a quote from it, I just can't do anything than be powerless to the impact that it gives. It's firstly a fight between two sides, which becomes a faith of the world, driven by love that must find the path for both individuals(not mentioning the side-story love, especially Margery Daw and Keisaku, it doesn't have much development, but it reaches it pinnacle too), and you will keep questioning yourself, maybe it was destiny, maybe it's an occurance, but after all, it's a story that develops so well, that you won't be able to forget it probably for your whole life, and will never forget the lessons and the words you have heard and seen by watching it. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is any anime I can recommend, this is the anime that I want to recommend, it's the anime that forever touched me, and will touch you. It's a very great start, at least for me. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Shakugan no Shana was a pretty good monster fighting urban fantasy.  It wasn't perfect, but it had good characters, a cool setting, and some pretty impressive action.  Shakugan no Shana Second was, in my mind, a little bit of a step down.  The show dragged a little, but it was still good overall.\r\nThen comes Shakugan no Shana Final.  In my mind, Final is the perfect capstone to the Shakugan no Shana series, possessing all of the strengths of what came before and then some, along with few if any of the weaknesses.  It changes the status quo, escalates the actionand stakes, and delivers not a choppy, episodic sort of story, but a true epic that uses every minute of its 24-episode running time and manages to do so without ever dragging\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the characters.  Now, while Final does assume you know how the characters developed through Shakugan no Shana and Second, it still gives plenty of time for exploring their inner turmoil, their desires and wishes.  In fact, I dare say that our leads, at the very least, get more good focus here than they had before, and are explored as even deeper characters.  A good part of this is from one of the first major changes to the status quo.  Some might consider this a spoiler, but it's in the first two episodes, so for Final and not the series as a whole?  I think it's fair game to talk about, and it really is something that has to be addressed to talk about the season: Yuji Sakai is the villain now.\\n\\n\r\nI am dead serious.  The character that started out as a meek and fairly helpless normal boy dragged into supernatural circumstances starts this season emerging from the state of having vanished from the world now holding the reins of the group of baddies that had formerly threatened him.  This is a pretty dangerous move for a story.  At least in theory we liked Yuji Sakai as he was, and having him turn into the leader of the Bal Masque means he could be seen as somewhat divorced from the character we previously understood.  In a less well-written show, the character we see in Final would be the same person in name only, or flagrantly possessed or some other excuse to have him be unrelated to what he was before.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, Shakugan no Shana Final is well-written, and manages this plot arc with flying colors.  Much of the season is dedicated to exploring Yuji Sakai as he is now, and why he's made the choices he has, including his goals and his motivations.  No switch has flipped from decent person to cackling villain, Yuji Sakai still has the core we've come to know, and though it takes a good deal of time to fully understand what he's playing, the getting there is interesting on its own, and helps you feel for Shana and Yuji's other friends as they try to piece together what's happened to him and who he is now.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, the previous seasons of Shakugan no Shana had very definite arcs.  One story would end, and the next one would begin, and while the major heroic characters would learn and grow through each arc, there wasn't exactly a meta-plot that would hold the entire season together.  And that, sort of a variant of \u201cmonster of the week\u201d, is fine for what it is.  However, Final has one, consistent story.  It has a lot of movements that you could consider to be separate arcs, but the saga that begins with the disappearance (and, especially, reappearance) of Yuji Sakai carries the show from episode 1 of Final to episode 24 and the bitter end.  As with Yuji himself, this is something that would have been very easy to do badly.  Second was padded out and dragged in places, wouldn't final end up the same way?\\n\\n\r\nIt really doesn't.  Final's pacing is some of the best I've seen, as is its action.  Big things do take a lot of time, but the tempo remains high throughout.  Every episode has enough character drama and/or action to more than justify its running time.  The story in final is expansive and sprawling; in addition to the main characters Shana, Yuji, and Wilhelmina, we get a ton of characters, both old and new, adding to the story.  I concede that a lot of them are somewhat one-note, but they have the development they need in order to fill their roles, usually and then some.  While the tertiary characters of Shakugan no Shana final may not be great characters on their own, they are all better than they had to be.  Characters with fairly small parts like Rebecca Reed, Chiara, or Ribesal didn't need the level of interest they got, but while they aren't the heroes of this story, the story knows they have their own lives and own tales that might even deserve to be told, and they're treated as people who have their own lives as well as their involvement in the big events of Shana Final.\\n\\n\r\nIt's shocking, but I really don't have any complaints about Shana Final.  It was flawlessly paced, the plot is epic and provides a great capstone to the Shakugan no Shana series.  The characters are fleshed out, and their conflict is engaging, both in terms of the stakes of their battle for the world and the investment in the people doing the fighting.  You want to see these characters get through their struggles, and by the end you're sort of rooting for everyone involved.  Every arc has the notes it needs, and even when something tragic happenings or the story takes an unfortunate turn, it's done in such a way that it feels right, because it's what the story needed.\\n\\n\r\nReally, part of the reason why I can't quite bring myself to rate this a 10, is because it doesn't stand on its own.  To watch Shakugan no Shana Final you really need Shakugan no Shana and Shakugan no Shana Second, and that's probably 20 hours of show to chew through to get to this part.  The payoff is well worth it, especially when the first two seasons were decent to good in their own right, but this isn't something to watch on its own.\\n\\n\r\nIt is, however, something I would wholeheartedly recommend.",

Since it's been a while since I watched the first and second seasons, i'll start off with a review about the third season. Please keep in mind this is just my opinion\r\nStory:\r\nWhere the first and second season completely set up an amazing story, I think the third season just came off as a disappointment to me, i've watched the first and second season of Shakugan no Shana 2-3 times, and I have to say the story is almost a masterpiece, and I expected much more from thethird season than what it gives us. I'll avoid giving spoilers, but it comes out with some developments that don't exactly make sense or fit into the story whatsoever, the first few episodes have little to no meaning when we look at the overall story. Also, I think they made the antagonists overly weak in the third season, I was expecting to see some like super-powerful opponents, but I was greatly disappointed, nothing like watching the first season and seeing the protagonist have trouble. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe art didn't really change, I thought the first and second season's art were masterpieces, so they stuck to it, and it still works.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIn my opinion, Shakugan no Shana uses some of the best soundtracks that are fitting to the anime. From the opening (Light my Fire - KOTOKO) to the ending (I'll Believe, One - ALTIMA) Shakugan no Shana utilizes some of the best songs in Japan i've ever heard. So I believe it deserves a 10/10 in the sound department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nEh, where the first and second season always made great developments of character, the third season didn't really bring anything special. There wasn't any real character development and it sort of just went off the flow that the second season set for it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs a fan of the Shana series, I couldn't bring myself to hate this anime, with all its shortcomings, I would still give it 9/10 in enjoyment, but I have to say from an objective point of view, it was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf this anime was a standalone anime, maybe it would score higher, but going off the great momentum the first and second season built for it, I think it was just disappointing to me, and maybe ending it at the second season was the best way to go. I agree that the way the writer ended this series was heartwarming, but the way the series got to the end was disappointing. Overall, i'd definitely give it 7-8/10 and that's being generous because i'm such a big fan of the series.",

            "content": "Content:\r\nAt first I was pretty disappointed by the sudden plot reversal after season 2, since I was enjoying the first two seasons so much. Season 3 was just so vastly different from the previous seasons that it almost felt like I was watching a different anime. Despite this, the story was very well executed. I found myself constantly questioning everything: is ___ really telling the truth? Who's right and who's wrong? Who is acting deliberately and who is being mislead? What is ___'s real goal? And most of all, what is right and what is wrong? This anime is among the best I've watched inthat regard, but because of the slow progression and the total 180 from the previous two seasons I have to knock a couple points off. Score: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThere wasn't anything special about the peaceful scenes, but the fight scenes were spectacular. There was so much stuff going on that it really made me feel in awe of the fighters. However, what really set this anime apart from others is that you could always tell exactly what was going on despite the massive content, unlike many others where the action scenes end up being utter chaos. Additionally, I appreciated the way CGI was used pretty much exclusively for the robots. Score: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nThere wasn't anything unique about the soundtrack, but it was very well done. Some kind of background music was present most of the time, and it always fit the scene and set the atmosphere very well. I would give the soundtrack an 8 if it weren't for the little jingles that play before and after commercial breaks. They weren't nearly as annoying as they were in the previous two seasons, but they were still irksome. Score: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis anime does not have great character development. It's not terrible, but there's nothing special, and if anything I'd say it was subpar, considering how little the main characters developed and how long it took them to do so; it was often hard to tell that anything changed until the very last episode. HOWEVER. This anime did something spectacular in the way that it effortlessly built characters and communicated their personalities without spending much time dedicated to each of them. There is some screentime dedicated to the backstories of a couple of the main characters, which is nothing special. It's the minor characters that set this anime apart. The number of characters with no solo screentime, who only play supplementary roles, is abnormally large in this anime, and yet I felt like I knew each of them personally just through their actions and behaviors that were displayed in the background of the main characters' endeavors. I have to knock two points off for the terrible development of the main characters, but this anime really did something special in this regard. Score: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall:\\n\r\nI have to give this anime a 6 for enjoyment, just because I was disappointed by the plot shift and a little frustrated at times with how slowly things were progressing. However, this season did a lot of things very well, and it could easily deserve an 8 or even a 9 for reasons discussed. I decided to lowball it a bit since I personally didn't find the whole as enjoyable as the sum of the parts. Score: 7/10",

            "content": "Well, in spite of others saying this season is confusing and yes indeed it is, but I think that adds to the mystery and slowly watching throughout the season, pieces come to together to help with the confusion later in the series. I must say the never ending 'ending' feel of it keeps me watching and wondering: When will all of this end? The only part that I do not fully understand is how Yuuji came to find the Snake of the Festival and their encounter. Although it briefs and it says Yuuji's motives are to make a peaceful world where Flame Hazes no longerhave to fight and so he can live with Shana, this part confuses me and makes me believe the Snake is deceiving him only to use him as a vessel for his existance until his body is rendered stable again. The goal of Yuuji is somewhat clear to me, but at the same time not as he constantly fights with Shana who is contempt to her own ways, despite his sincereity for doing all this for her. Overall I think a couple more episodes could have been added to the beginning to help tie some loose ends and clarify how all this came to be. But if you really enjoy the series like I do, all confusion will start to unravel itself in time.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9 Since the introduction is yet to fully clarify itself. However the rest of the plot unravels itself throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 I have to say the art in this anime is spectacular. In my own opinion. it's not dull and a lot of effects and quality character designs.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10 The music really gets you in the mood and the effects of fighting and magic are also quite unique.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 With the lack of clear character motive in the begining and somewhat throughtout the season, I feel Yuuji's character drastically changed without a clear reason and cause. Sure he met the Snake of the Fesitval and whatnot and wants to free Flame Hazes, but his past character wouldn't have aggreed to go against Shana. However, his kindness and desire to help others can also contradict this as he says he IS fighting for Shana's freedom.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, supporting characters such as Margery and Sauto's development has finally reached a point where... \\n\\n\r\n***(SPOILER)***\\n\r\nThey finally realize eachothers feelings for eachother.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the fact that Tanaka has resolved to not being part of the world of Crimson Lords and such anymore and stays behind with Ogata to be by her side.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 The seemingly never endless conclusion carries throughout the season. The season could have ended within the first few eps, and again in the middle of the season. But it kept on trucking and the final revelation is yet to be seen. Thus keeps me interested in what will happen next and is this finally it? A unique strategy that only a few anime can pull off and STILL leave enjoyment for the viewer instead of it seemingly repeating itself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9. It was really close to a perfect score. But a few flaws and lack of clearance has left me with a feeling of 'emptiness' on the situation in the begining and still kinda feel it.",

            "content": "Okay, as always I want to preface my review with the three things I\u2019m looking for in an anime: I want a really good story (+5), I want really good dialogue (characters/character development, etc.)(+3), and I want really good \u201ctechnicals\u201d (style, sound, etc.)(+2). Also, I\u2019ll remind you my reviews generally encompass the whole series of an anime unless otherwise stated (That is to say that no more seasons are coming out). So let\u2019s get to it!\r\nShakugan no Shana\u2026 I feel that this anime had an enormous amount of potential. With a story revolving around the competing \u2019existences\u2019, i.e. Flame Hazes vs. Crimson Denizens, who resideon different planes of reality, the show hit\u2019s the ground running with a really cool premise. Think about it, battles going on in an unseen world that you\u2019ll never know about, yet the outcomes of which could and does effect your life in unimaginable ways. So much so that you could just be written out of existence! This was going to be the tragic fate of our protagonist, however, as it just so happens he\u2019s not your everyday human. The story continues with his adventures trying to figure out his place now that this whole new unseen reality has been revealed to him. To me, that\u2019s a goldmine of possibilities set up to work with. \\n\\n\r\nEarning 4 points \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the ending of this anime decides to throw all that in the garbage. Nearly the entirety of the last season is a mess of epic proportions. Instead of continuing with all the good things the first seasons had built up, the last season goes on its own into the wilderness of horrible endings. By introducing practically a whole new cast of characters, creating nonsensical plot drivers, and just plain ridiculous reasoning by the characters in terms of their decision making faculties, Shakugan no Shana goes out in a pyre of infamy. Frankly, I\u2019m going to be watching it to appear on some top ten list of \u201cMost Unexpected Anime Endings\u201d, because I found it hard to swallow that something so good could become so bad.\\n\\n\r\nDeduction: -1.5 points\\n\r\n----------------------------\\n\\n\r\nAs for the dialogue and character development, I was quite pleased for the most part. The interactions and relationship between the protagonist and Shana were well executed and all in all, the characters were enjoyable. The romantic elements were handled to my liking, and, the protagonist does grow throughout the story as a character (as does Shana). There are some characters (especially towards the end) that are left high and dry in the character development department, but, all main characters have enough in my humble opinion to allow the story to progress relatively unhindered. \\n\\n\r\nEarning 2 points\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\\n\r\nTechnicals are solid. I truly enjoyed the entire OST of this anime, the style and animation were good too. No complaints.\\n\\n\r\nEarning 2 points  \\n\r\n---------------------\\n\\n\r\nBonus points award goes to\u2026 having some really cool Flame Hazes out there! And some cool powers to come with them! \\n\\n\r\nEarning 1 point. \\n\r\n--------------------\\n\\n\r\nAdd it all up and we have a score of 7.5! If you want my advice, just watch the first two seasons only, then let your imagination make up what\u2019s going to happen next. It\u2019ll be better that way. Trust me, if I had done that, this anime would have been an 8.5 easy.\\n\\n\r\nAs always, since I\u2019m a critic, I\u2019ll round down my score to a 7 because that\u2019s just the way it goes. That way it\u2019ll be better than expected when you watch it! Till next time",

            "content": "This is more of a comparison than a review (not following the usual format).\r\nShakugan no Shana III is very different from the previous two seasons. It might throw many fans under the truck. The plot is twisted and a ton of new characters and rules appeared.  The anime did a poor job explaining them all (you will have to do some extra reading). There is a lot more fighting and less drama in this season. It can pretty stand by itself, in which case I would give it a 6/10. However, consider the development of other two; I gave all 3 seasons an 8/10.\\n\r\n*Spoiler:  The third season suffers a common \u201cdisease\u201d- mess up power scale. Yuuji becomes a god, yet he remains surprisingly weak. He is even weaker after recovered the god\u2019s body?!?  On contrary, Shana becomes ridiculously strong \u201csometimes\u201d \u2013  she can barely beat normal Denizens in the other two seasons, but now she kicks Yuuji (the strongest God)\u2019s ass ?!? \\n\r\nA major flaw: Why are they fighting all the time? Both sides could have easily negotiated, since Denizens\u2019 goal is to make another world for themselves. If not, right after the crushing victory, Denizens could have asked for peace. Yuuji banned eating humans, but he didn\u2019t attempt a peace treaty? Yuuji could have told Shana about his plan and started the negotiation at any time. Yet they fought until the end, Yuuji was fixing the city\u2014he was saving lives for god sake, but Shana fought him anyway?!? \\n\r\nSeason 3 motto is \u201ckill first talk later\u201d.  \\n",

In reality...\r\nYuuji had decided to side with the enemy.

Not to mention that he was helping the Crimson Denizen with their ultimate plan of creating a new world. \\n\\n\r\nThe battles, new characters, the twists and turns, the new powers Shana gained in her quest to get her man back and the sacrifices that were made all culminated to what was a nice ending to a series that I thought would be a run of the mill action romance series. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a special series for me now and I can't recommend it enough. 10/10 and it's gonna take something extra special to dislodge this series from my number 1 of all time.",

            "content": "This one took me a while to finish, which has been unusual for me and an anime for a long time. This review of the series as a whole, although I will be focusing mostly on the final season.\r\nWatching the first two seasons, I found myself enjoying Shakugan no Shana very much. The story and character development, along with the romantic tones, were very well structured. It was something I was hoping for in this anime, and it lived up to my expectations quite well.\r\nThe third season, however, changed this, if only a tad. The random change to Sakai Yuji's position in the show wasnot only very unexpected but was something I rather disliked. I found myself halfway through the season and extremely bored at times. I actually ended up only watching a single episode, if that, when I went to watch.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end of the final season I still found myself bored at times but it became far more enjoyable. The final few episodes made for a great end to the series, with large battles, the defeat of some really annoying characters (The Professor for example) and a resolution to the lover's quarrel between Yuji and Shana in the final moments of the final episode. The final two episodes unexpectedly became a huge redeemer to my overall disappointment in the final season. \\n\\n\r\nI would highly recommend this show to anyone willing to watch. If you prefer to skip out on the frustration of the final season, the end of the second season is almost a perfect place to stop. That being said, I'm a guy who likes to see things to the end if I can.\\n\\n\r\nFirst season: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSecond season: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThird season: 7/10 (It would honestly rank as a 6.5, but I prefer whole numbers)",

            "content": "Well, I'm not certain why I'm writing this or if I should do it, I'm probably just being selfish but anyway I'll do it. I hope someone enojy reading this tought I just want to express some feelings I had as a true fan who watched Shakugan since season one and waited years, prayed to God for season 3 to come, and that the tsunami hadn't killed the show's cast. After that, I got really, really excited when I heard the rumors that it would come out. I waited for really long. This series was my top rating series ever. I can't describe the feelingthis series gave me, because since I watched my 50th anime, I don't get them anymore for a unknown reason. The thing is, when the official anouncement came, I was hardly happy. Why? You tell me. Maybe I waited for too long? I watched it anyway, hoping the final season would bring me the feelings I had long experienced. I am aware about the actual quality of Shakugan's plot since the start of it and I'm aware it is not top notch. But what I got from the final season was mediocre seinen. Even with most struggle I can't build a logical thinking about the build of the plot. It is just bad. I know maybe I'm digging too deep to find things that are hardly found in anime, but then it makes Shakugan no Shana Final just another anime. Season 3 is about a fake emotional struggle, where the main characters create a war where most people say that love or saving the world can explain it in some way. If it is centered on changing the world, it has no sense together with the show's circunstances. If it's about love, it's even more stupid. The only way I can see it is the lack of creativity from the creators. All that summarizes this final season is the kiss in the very last minute of the anime, something every fan really waited for long enough. Actually, this season could have been really good if the protagonist motives were just evil, or if the character made explicitely human mistakes. The nature of a thinking being was incredibly distorted in a way that happens in most fantasy themes, where they just stop following logic or, they lose their brains and start acting like dolls controlled by an umature person who can only see the ending, in this case, the final kiss, whitout caring about the present of the story. Because even the final minutes where typical nonsense, stuff that would only be interesting if in a show ironizing and criticizing the way most animes are poorly done, like with \"epic\" senseless battles and weird cuteness or polictical bs and random people dying, like those things, just for themselves, make it good. I really wish I didn't think like this. I wait months or years now for a good anime to come, with some very rare ocasions where I find one that is entertaining. The good this is the anime industry is not the only place where you can find good stories, well, this is almost a stupid thing to write. Going back to Shana, no, it didn't make me feel like the first two seasons did, Even more, it made me look back to my past and see that I wouldn't enjoy them also, with the stardards I carry today. The thing is, this isn't a bad anime, when compared to most anime. You can certainly enjoy it, and feel like I did in the past. I can't even described the feelings. I don't like saying this, but its the damn truth, all anime watchers around hate hearing. Growing up. People mature in different ways from each other. At least thats what I think from my experiences. Some people will get more serious like me, and I gotta tell you it really sucks lol. Other will forever see the comedy and fun of watching nonsense. And it's not sush a bad thing. It's selfish of me to wish that all animes made out there fit my taste. But this one really hit my personal feelings. Yeah I'm this weird. Enjoy. Overall, I was really touched by this series, for some reason, but after years, it now sucks, and, even if I will never trully know, I think this is the worst season of them all. Love is the most powerfull spell, and it also makes animes look better than they are. Like with everything in life. So love everything and be the happiest person ever.",

There was a tun of action and movement through out the series. And on top of that the seven way map of love between the characters adds a lot of spice into the mix. \r\nBut where the good begin the bed ends. Even the though the season was just down right amazing it was vary hard to follow. I was left withsome big question that never got answered myself. Not only that but the series introduced many, many characters with little to no background which just added to the difficulty of following the series.\\n\\n\r\nMy main issue are my un answered question so if anyone wouldn't mind answering them I would be SOOOOO happy!!! Thank you\\n\\n\r\n1. Why did Yuji join the bal masque?\\n\r\n2. Why did the flame hazes try to stop the creation of Xanadu?\\n\r\n3. Yuji make Xanadu so the denezins can't go and learn to live in peace with humans, why not just do that in the real world?\\n\r\n4.in the beginning yuji said that all he wanted to do was walk with shana but then by the end he wanted to be alone in Xanadu, Why?\\n\r\n5. Yuji said that he wanted to punish him self for all the deaths he caused but none of the deaths would of happened if he had just stayed with shana and his friends, whats that about?\\n\r\n6. Why did yuji take shana to Xanadu and leave all of his friends and family behind, never to remember him?\\n\\n\r\nIt would help me out a lot if someone, anyone could answer my questions, plyz and thank you\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Compared to the last season, Shakugan no Shana Final starts right where it ends: With Yuki Sakai meeting Shana and Kazumi in his answer. But in the moments before he chooses Shana, he disappears. What became of him? Why is everyone forgetting him?\r\nThe Story:\r\nPacks a punch just like the last season. Voice acting in the Funimation Dub was superb.  Shana's journey comes to a close with the battle of her life. \r\nMoments to Look Forward to:\r\n-Margery Daw's nervous breakdown and self realization that the enemy she has been fighting is staring her in the eyes the whole time. Must see.\r\n-Yuji in a different form,with a new plan in mind on how to release Shana from her Flame Haze duties. But will she beckon to this call?\\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion to an amazing story, that has been tense for two seasons.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Biggest Changes:\\n\\n\r\n-More Bal Masque scenes, since Yuji is now on their side.\\n\\n\r\n-Feels like the series evolved because of the dark theme.\\n\\n\r\n-Shana is stronger, and now changing in her attitudes on life.\\n\\n\r\n-Shana is becoming more aware of who she is, and that her and the Flame Haze are one and the same. More angelic moments, that make her seem more than what she has been for the series.\\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion of Shana/Yuji. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThis series made me cry many times, and feel for the characters. Shana is truly evolved from the beginning of the show -- she is not thinking with her battle sense, but with her heart. Her own friendships are at stake, and the Flame Hazes are changing in their own sense of what they are truly fighting for.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Downside:\\n\\n\r\nYes, at times it does feel as if they are grabbing for straws for the plot. At times it seems it is a Bleach-like story, but it does show climax through the series. I enjoyed it, but sometimes I felt maybe the pacing was a bit rushed in the third season. The one season they did start to change the plot out of nowhere, and make it serious.\\n\\n\r\nFans may not like Yuji's newfound place as Snake of the Festival, and also may not like how there is little filler and straight plot. Sometimes the plot feels forced, as if the war is the prominent story and no little slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't until episode 16-17 that the series does pick up, and start feeling more like the previous installments.\\n\\n\r\nShana's independence is a great addition to the show. Her own powers have grown, and it is nice to see our own Flaming Haired Burning Eyed Hunter evolve so much.\\n\\n\r\nNever backing down from her stance, Shana never changes her perspective on how to go about things. That is why I love this series so much. The struggles she goes through show how much that she has never turned away from her role as a Flame Haze. I love the fact that this anime turned out so well, and had climactic moments that made you question what side you were truly on. Whether it be, Bal Masque or the Flame Haze side -- you are in for a treat to the conclusion of this gorgeous anime.",

            "content": "==SPOILER WARNING==\r\nThis review assumes the reader has seen the first two seasons of the show. Proceed at your own risk.\r\nThe first two seasons of Shakugan no Shana were a very enjoyable experience, and the final moment of Shakugan no Shana II (Second) left me with high hopes that the following season would do what so few anime strive for, which is to elaborate on the central relationship beyond the confession. Watching the OVA, which at first seemed to be nothing more than filler, I was soon informed that I may not be getting what I hoped for.\r\nShakugan no Shana III (Final) oddly strays from thepath that the prior seasons were building, a sudden and jarring step in the wrong direction. It begins with the disappearance of Sakai Yuji, a phenomenon soon explained to be because he had become one with the leader of Bal Masque, the Snake of the Festival. To have the main couple grow so close, only for such a thick wall to be thrown between them - they say conflict builds character, but an obstacle so great can only hurt their relationship, and that it did. Clear that Yuji had become the antagonist of his own will, he and Shana are torn apart. Despite their attempts to bring the other back to their own side, it's clear that they no longer have the same bond they once did, which greatly hurts the romantic appeal of the show. Even in the end when things finally seem resolved, Yuji's determination as the antagonist is sustained until the very last moments, stripping the conclusion of its satisfaction.\\n\\n\r\nYuji alone is not the only instance of poor choices this season makes. Characters who once seemed important are revealed to be nothing in the grand scheme. Ike's uselessness is brought to light by his major lack of presence. His true purpose in the show becomes clear: to stand between Yuji and Kazumi, whether it be to help them along or to try and take Kazumi for himself. Once he confesses in the second season, his purpose is fulfilled, and they rightly cast him aside. Similarly, Tanaka and Ogata's entire dynamic is thrown away. With Ogata's lack of presence, the entirety of Tanaka's character development disappears, and he reverts to the same grunt role he had in the first season. Of the human characters, the only two who continued to show promise were Kazumi and Satou, the former more than the latter.\\n\\n\r\nHumans aside, (Final) has a terrible problem of throwing in Flame Haze and Denizens where they don't belong. The season introduces new characters on both sides whenever it gets the chance, making for a surplus of meaningless stand-ins to take hits and kill grunts. They have no time to grow on the viewer, and thus their emotional moments fall flat. It also makes for a few difficult moments keeping track of who's who.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all these problems, though, (Final) was not as terrible as it could have been. It may have chosen the wrong path on which to end the series, but its journey down that path was handled rather well. The characters who still had purpose, and who the viewer had time to become attached to, were utilized in very exciting battles and emotional moments. The aesthetics were lovely, and as always the soundtrack was phenomenal.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I feel that (Final) was an unnecessary ending to the series. It was not so reliant on information from the past seasons that it needed to happen the way it did, and the ambiguity between good and evil throughout left for an abundance of uncertainty and lack of satisfaction. Still, it did not fail to take what it had, no matter the quality, and make an overall enjoyable experience.",

            "content": "So all you really need to know: THIS ANIME IS GREAT FOR SOME BACKGROUND NOISE WHILE YOU DO SOMETHING ON YOUR PHONE 10/10\r\nAfter totally marathoning all 3 seasons and Shana S, I can say that Final was probably the most mind bending cluster of useless fluff thrown your way. \r\nHonestly, story is pathetic and so is Yuji. The only thing that kept me going through the slog of background noise the series was the hope that we get to see why Yuji chose to do what he does, and its one of the most pathetic reasoning I've seen. Now, if this was the Yuji backin season 1 I would understand but clearly Yuji has regressed mentally for however much the anime overplays his \"Strategic mind\". \\n\\n\r\nI can't speak for those who've read the novel, but the anime gives just about 0 reason and it all boils down to, \"I want to be next to Shana but I have an inferiority complex so I'm going to do some crap so I can leave a mark on the world\"\\n\\n\r\nIt might be much to hope for but for roughly 70 episodes of content I can say that about 20 episodes worth of time that are totally useless and contrived. I guess it was a money thing. \\n\\n\r\nShana Final just has so much that it tried to take that it did nothing well. I found myself more invested in the story of Satou, Tanaka, and Margery Daw than I was with Yuji. Nearly every side character (excluding Yoshida, because, well, shes Yoshida) was so much better. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, seeing Shana's dere side is all that really motivated me.",
