            "content": "A review for both S1 and S2 with spoilers\r\nOnly having experienced Fate/Zero, I never encountered a Type-Moon written work before. But after watching UBW, I\u2019m truly appalled at how terrible Type-Moon\u2019s writing is.\r\nThe basis of UBW\u2019s plot is covered by its synopsis. In different wording, it\u2019s a grandiose battle royale-like duel between seven masters who each get a servant to fight for them. The goal is to kill every servant to attain the Holy Grail, which can grant a master and servant any fathomable wish. \r\nThis plot, even though basic on the surface, can become a masterpiece with proper execution, as seen in Fate/Zero withits large-scale fights, charismatic characters, and intriguing battles strategies. As the follow up to such an impressive series, UBW had a lot of weight on its shoulders to deliver the same grade, or possibly an even better, of quality. But unfortunately, not only did this series become a wreck within itself, but it also became one of the biggest disappoints that I\u2019ve ever experienced. \\n\\n\r\nBoth seasons of UBW suffer from the same pitfalls that include lacklustre characterisation, laughable battle strategies, and choppy protagonists. But the second season specifically has its own unique failures which I\u2019ll get to throughout the review. Let\u2019s get started:\\n\\n\r\nThe characterisation was one of the most noticeable falls of the show. The show virtually revolves around our protagonist two-teamed quartet Rin Tohsaka and her servant Archer, and Shirou Emiya and his servant Saber, while the other characters don\u2019t get the proper circumstances and/or screentime to become worth talking about. The show\u2019s first problem child is the \u201cintelligent\u201d Rin Tohsaka, who is the strategist on the protagonist side. Rather than intelligent, the word perseverant describes her more accurately. Many people say that she\u2019s smart, and while it\u2019s shown that she\u2019s book smart, she has no experience in applying it properly. Examples of these failures are shown in her \u201cstrategies\u201d that she comes up with. She's capable of generating multiple theories that appear profitable, but in the end all of her elaborate strategies amount to repeatedly showing up to a servant\u2019s base, provoking them until a battle breaks out, and ultimately losing in the end. On the off chance that she does manage to kill a servant, it\u2019s with an unexpected factor or the assistance of another servant. For example, after the oh-so-many attempts of trying to kill Caster, in the midst of yet another failure, the only way Caster was killed was by Archer - after his contractual separation from Rin - who launched an attack on her off-guard master, anticipating that she come in to protect him. The remainder of her victories are due to even more outside assistance that would otherwise leave her and her team dead.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have Saber, one of the main servants of the show and on the protagonists\u2019 team. Her gender bent character in Fate/Zero captured the eyes of many with her chivalric and powerful persona. But sadly, in UBW this strong personality was reduced to a slapstick tsundere and fanservice device. With erotic shots of her in BDSM-esque positions from her capture by Caster further corroding her character, it also gave the series an unintentional comical tone.\\n\\n\r\nAnd unfortunately, to finish off, we have Shirou: our dense protagonist that\u2019s plagued with a terribly-conflicting Samaritan complex; to such a degree where it makes it appear like his character is a parody of the average shounen protag due to how flat, irritating, and stupid his character is in the show. His boring dialogues with Rin and idiotic remarks aside, the most obnoxious part about Shirou was his philosophical stance towards the end of the season. The latter end of season two held a philosophical discussion with Archer and Shirou\u2019s battle about the pursuit of seemingly impossible ideals and its potential risks. The show took an interesting take on this by adding in an element that, in my opinion, serves as a device of self-reflection that further enhanced the potential of this discussion. Shirou faces the scorn of Archer who, as a future version of Shirou, is morally-crippled and dispirited as a result of the despair and anguish he faced due to Shirou\u2019s far-fetched altruistic ideal of saving everyone while ignoring himself in the process. Archer, trying desperately to convince Shirou to quit pursuing this seemingly impossible ideal to avoid the future tragedy that is himself, brings up several opposing points, including the most obvious one that shows how his ideals are contradictory: \u201cIt's true that you can probably achieve your wish to save others. But there's no hope of saving yourself in doing so.\u201d \\n\r\nAfter Archer\u2019s defeat in battle, Shirou fights Gilgamesh, who also adds onto Archer\u2019s scolding by telling Shirou that his philosophy is contrived and \u201cfake\u201d as a result of trying to become like his father, Kiritsugu, who he essentially copied his ideals from him. Shirou concedes to all of the points given by Archer and Gilgamesh, but somehow manages to come to some sort of epiphany and unexplainably validates his ideals and insist that they are \u201cright\u201d, even in the presence of the overwhelming evidence that blatantly showcases that, without a sense of realism, his ideals will remain damaging and chaotic. The point this discussion was trying to sell was that the pursuit of one\u2019s ideals and dreams is not in vain even with risks and failures up ahead. Where the discussion went sour was with Shirou\u2019s final justification of his ideals, which none of it rebutted the statements and examples of Archer and Gilgamesh. His justification can literally be summarised with his new infamous quote \u201cJust because you\u2019re correct doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWith my expectations so high for this series, it pains me to write such a scathing review. I truly wished for the best and tried to ignore the faults, but they became too large in number for me to continue to be blind to. With the fights and animation as the only two saving graces, I can say that in some moments, UBW was truly entertaining. But the journey overall was a boring and painfully bleak one with this show.",

            "content": "This review covers the Prologue, Season One and Season Two. My ratings are 6/10, 6/10 and 5/10 respectively. There are spoilers in this review.\r\nThe prologue/first few episodes of Unlimited Budget Works establishes the Fifth Holy Grail War; a battle royale between seven servants (made up of mythological figures such as Heracles) and mages where the last survivor is rewarded with being presented the Holy Grail which can grant them any wish they desire. During these episodes it is emphasized how dangerous this war is where even witnesses of the war will be murdered. Then in episode three the feeling of danger for our protagonists disappearsin an instant when Ilya decides to suddenly quit her battle with Rin and Shirou for no reason and go home. This doesn't get followed up on nor does it develop into anything. Perhaps my expectations were too high expecting fights to have an impact from the beginning, but these kinds of moments happen frequently. Some examples include; Archer's many chances to kill Shirou, Caster and Kuzuki not finishing off Shirou and Rin in episode ten and every fight where Gilgamesh is involved. \\n\\n\r\nWith the characters not taking fights seriously, another way to create tension in these fights is to emphasize the stakes of the Holy Grail War. To an extent, this works in UBW. The mages and servants eventually get eliminated, there are stories of innocent people disappearing or dying and the end game for Gil involves attempting to kill everyone. But these aren't executed well. The mages and servants would have their backstories explained in the episode they are about to be defeated, making it predictable. The innocent people's deaths are left in the background and their effects are never seen. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the end game, only a simplistic understanding can be gained from it due to the lack of explanation of the history, function and importance of the Holy Grail. All that's told by the show is that the Holy Grail may potentially be able to grant a wish of some kind, it can be used for evil, might not even require the war to be summoned and can be summoned by using a mage as a host. The Holy Grail itself appears as a pink blob. Most of these things get explained properly in other Nasuverse publications, however I believe that for a better viewer's experience they should have tried to address these problems in UBW. Nevertheless, they already have sequels planned so perhaps they will go into more depth then.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus of UBW is the emergence of Shirou as a mage. As a protagonist, Shirou comes off as a generic anime male teen with a naive mindset. He is a self proclaimed \"hero of justice\" because apparently everyone needs saving and only he can do it... by murdering people. If this show had a darker tone he would sound like a crazier version of Batman. Sadly though, the only exploration of his naive ideas and any other themes in UBW comes during his battle with Archer, which mostly involves repeating lines ad nauseam. There is also a forced romance thrown in to attempt to show Shirou's progression. He's not terrible as a character, but he's nothing special either.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in UBW lack development. Some characters will be given short backstories before dying, but no characters show any real change. The closest are Saber and Shirou deciding that they're proud of themselves. Rin simply stays as a typical tsundere for the whole show. An argument could be made that there wasn't enough time given to character development. However, there would be more than enough time if the pacing was improved. For example, the character monologues during fights (Shirou vs Archer especially) could be edited down or episodes such as Winter Days, Faraway Home could be condensed into a few minutes. While I feel the phrase \"show, don't tell\" is overused, I believe it is appropriate in this case.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other issues and potential plotholes that could be nitpicked, such as Archer not having any knowledge of his earlier life, but I'd rather now look at the positives in UBW. The animation is incredibly fluid, especially during fight scenes. The incorporation of CGI feels natural and makes some scenes a real spectacle to watch. The sound effects are great and the voice acting is satisfactory. These technical aspects alone are enough to make UBW watchable. The soundtrack adds an extra level of enjoyment, especially the fan favourite OP Brave Shine by Aimer.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all the faults in UBW, the journey the characters go through is enjoyable enough to make this show satisfactory. Watching this won't be a special experience and other than the fight scenes, most of it will be forgettable. Nevertheless, unless you're a big fan of the Nasuverse, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to watch it.",

            "content": "The franchise of Type-Moon. Fate/Stay Night is a trademark for what the product has been with its key characters, premise, and setting. Fate Unlimited Blade Works is one of its major routes and returns for another season. A show about the Holy Grail sparkles into a pendulum of events and animated by the infamous Ufotable studio. Part 1 delivered what many fans wanted while part 2 attempts to do so yet again.\r\nWith the way the first half of Unlimited Blade Works was handled, part 2/Season 2 essentially sets up major events for the story. As for those who remembers, Saber is taken by Caster, Rinleaves after telling Shirou not to get involved in the Holy Grail War anymore, while Shirou wonders what awaits him next. The process of this buildup is quite thrilling as it sets up many potential events. Along the way, there are also other characters that becomes imperative to the ongoing storyline. A good amount of focus is Archer, Rin\u2019s former servant who apparently betrayed her. This season focuses a lot about his past, role, and purpose for what he is doing. As a show that\u2019s indulged by ideologies, it\u2019s interesting to see his arguments with others in particular Shirou. It defines their personalities and existence in this show not only but what they do but their reasons. From Shirou\u2019s viewpoint, his father Kiritsugu has inspired him to become a hero of justice. This becomes a central theme of Shirou\u2019s character as he tries to save the people he cares about. At the same time, there\u2019s some romance development between him and Rin. As clich\u00e9 it seems, it\u2019s not entirely surprising given the amount of hints the two have been throwing around. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, the series\u2019 main story still focuses on the Holy Grail War. Character building is important but at the same time, it allows the viewers to directly see their actions. While Illya isn\u2019t the most powerful servant in the show, she does make quite an impression against Shinji\u2019s servant, Gilgamesh. What comes around goes around and events that unfolds shows her devotion to Berserker. She even shows her genuine concern towards her maids. The show also does a decent job with characterizing her past including the Einzbern family. Do be warned that there will be some Fate/Zero spoilers involved. However, by this point, you should of watched Fate/Zero anyways. Later on, there are also some big reveals regarding Shirou and what his destiny may await him. It\u2019s what really makes the show thrilling as it anticipate what viewers awaits next. What is holding the show back though is some of the omitted content from the visual novel. From what I understand, it added filler material (or so some fans call it anime original) and extended dialogue that makes some scenes unnecessary longer.\\n\\n\r\nA strong point of this series is also the character relationships. At the center of it is Shirou who builds connections with others. In season 1, he build a prominent relationship of trust and respect with Saber. In the second part, he plays an important role alongside Rin. The first half of the series neglects Saber\u2019s prominence as the majority of the time, she is trapped by magic. And without a servant, Shirou is running around without a servant. He can only put trust in people such as Rin and at one point even admits that he has feelings for her. In essence, it shows how Shirou\u2019s role can have profound influence on others through his ideology. In the meantime, other characters such as Illya/Berserker, Shinji/Gilgamesh, Caster/Kazuki all gets their screen time of relationship connections. There\u2019s obviously some contrast between these especially with their climatic moments. But for what\u2019s worth, Fate Unlimited Blade Works can really make some impact when it shows the way these relationships are executed. \\n\\n\r\nAs the protagonist, Shirou\u2019s ideal and growth is a pivotal part of the show. This becomes a bit controversial at some stages as some people may not agree with him. Furthermore, these put into conflicts with others such as Archer and Gilgamesh. His idealism is similar to his former servant, Saber in many ways as well. Unfortunately, the show doesn\u2019t put much emphasis in Saber as much as part 1. It still gives her some time for development and evolves both her and Shirou, but just not them on a personal level or at least as much as Shirou and Rin. Similarly, Shirou\u2019s battle against Archer seems more like the apex of the show to me rather than the final fights. Here, we can see that Shirou is fighting for an ideal rather than just winning the grail/fight. On the other hand, Shirou\u2019s battle against Gilgamesh is stereotypical. Gilgamesh is a character that lacks strong characterization compared to the others although the show does flesh out his personality in full view. Egoistic, prideful, and arrogant are just a few words to describe him. But unlike some of the other servants, his relationships aren\u2019t so well developed. Just look at Shinji for an example and see where how he ended up. As the latter half of this season unfolds, we\u2019ll learn much more about each characters\u2019 reasoning for their choices. And Fate being a show that emphasizes a lot on this with lectures and metaphors, it\u2019s no surprise by this point. What I do have some issues with is the comedy and romance development. The comedy part seems like it has some improper timings. While it\u2019s not a core part of the season, I feel like they don\u2019t belong in this franchise at all except for some of the slice of life scenarios; mostly seen in season 1. The romance is also lacking. One of the episodes later on presents this in with a bit of symbolism. (yes I know what you are thinking, the infamous \u201cdolphins\u201d). However, what the fans got instead is a big question mark. On the contrary, the action bits of the show is a blockbuster hit. The climatic battles in the Unlimited Blade Works is a big part that was hyped from the buildup. Both times, Shirou shows his growth and what he has learned. Not to mention, he is a man that runs about his perspective ideologies so by some point, you\u2019ll even remember his lines.\\n\\n\r\nUfotable does it again. When it comes to artwork and visuals, the series shows why it\u2019s a powerhouse. Action is fairly solid especially in some of the more exciting fights. The Unlimited Blade Works is also highly decorative with the countless swords and symbolism. The backgrounds also has a mythic feeling to it when it matches its fantasy elements. My favorite parts would be the flower garden in one of the earlier episodes as well as the Unlimited Blade Works world. They really gave the word elegant a worthy meaning. Furthermore, we get a bit of violence to go along with all the action. Shinji, Illya, Caster are among some of these character that becomes a prime sample of this. On the other hand, the show isn\u2019t immune to censorship. Some of the more graphic content is censored by magical context while we get a rather obscure symbolism between Shirou/Rin\u2019s bonding. Hey, it\u2019s not like this was surprising though. Did you actually expect them to do it on screen?\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is a stronger point of the series. The OP and ED theme song has an eerie tune that matches with the coordination of its presentation. Shirou\u2019s battle theme is also emphasized to show how much he has grown throughout the season. Finally, voice mannerisms is uniquely dynamic for the most prominent characters in this season. In particular, I find Gilgamesh\u2019s narcissistic personality to be so matching with his voice. We can also feel the emotions that Saber expresses by her voice tone and Archer\u2019s revelation. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say the overall soundtrack gets any better than that. In retrospect, it\u2019s a strong technical aspect of the season but doesn\u2019t exceed the expectations I got from part 1 either.\\n\\n\r\nSo how does Fate ultimately deliver? Well, for a show about magic, grail wars, and drama, it\u2019s certainly a chilling thriller that any Type-Moon fan should see. Director Takahiro Miura makes this story stand uniquely with its themes and style. And although some parts of the visual novel is omitted and replaced, it still ultimately lives up to its mature magic. That\u2019s because the real magic comes from the story and characters. For a talky show like this, it\u2019s often important to capture a viewers\u2019 interest before they are bored to death. Thankfully, on most parts, the show knows its strategies. It\u2019s also no surprise that the series continues to maintain its visual wonder. Suspenseful, thrilling, and crafted with emotional storytelling, the second season of Fate Unlimited Blade Works is a magical gift from Ufotable.",

            "content": "This review will be harsh, but second season of Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works fully deserved it. And don't be deceived by the catchy slogan \"Unlimited Budget Works\". The only thing which is truly unlimited in this anime is characters' redundant talking. \r\nSome of the show's weak points were unavoidable - the original material's storyline quality is dubious at times and the fact that Unlimited Blade Works as a second route of Visual Novel is supposed to be built up over experiences from the first one definitely doesn't help when someone is adapting it. But VN's weaknesses aside, its premise is interesting enough to makean entertaining show with lots of cool fights. And first season of UBW managed to do that fairly well. \\n\\n\r\nSecond season, on the other hand, does almost everything wrong. The animation is still gorgeous, but all the rest, oh girl. First of all - the creators seem to think that main strength of F/SN UBW is its story and, inevitably, character of Shirou. It's a massive problem, because Shirou is really not that great (which essentially means: he sucks). He wasn't that great in original VN, neither in F/SN 2006 and he still isn't in UBW. But now not because of his sexism or blandness but because his central conflict (which is the central conflict of the story now) is shamelessly moronic. What's much, much worse (moronic conflicts in action flicks aren't necessarily a bad thing) - the series abandons much of the action and characters' interactions in favor of explaining his utterly idiotic conflict to the viewer. Explaining again and again by two, three, four (I've lost count) episodes of pure talking. And by the end of this talking they still explained not very much - the viewer gets crazy amount of plot holes and plot conveniences instead. It's very clearly inherited from visual novel, but transfer of this style of exposition and this lazy writing into TV is inexcusable. The exact same problems haunt the interactions with and exposition of the main villain of the anime. Both these arcs are just plain bad - and because they happen to be the final ones they basically kill the show.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, as a result of putting emphasis on Shirou and his internal struggles, the show wastes other, much more interesting characters. Rin and especially Saber are sent off to backgrounds and play a role of damsels in distress. Rin in second part of the season continuously acts out of her supposed character. Saber on the other hand is literally doing nothing - which was explainable in the VN (she had her own route) but in the stand-alone anime it looks bizarre, to say the least. The anime even manages to botch the highlight part of its fictional universe - the moment Saber screams \"EXCALIBUR!!!\" isn't particularly memorable in this version. Which is really a shame. \\n\\n\r\nThe other part which seems to be forgotten by writers is the romance part of the original material and constitutes another example of character wasting - it started off quite well but it gets abandoned in favor of Shirou's struggles for many episodes. And then the series returns to it for a brief moment, in most convoluted sex-scene replacement I've had an honor to witness. This replacement is out of place, out of character and completely out of story's coherence. And honestly, if the series wasn't bad in the first place, its low score would be warranted on virtue of this scene alone - the very idea that, gasp, physical contact between characters (even in form of a kiss) is something which needs to be replaced in the show for teens is insulting and actively helps to make the world a worse place. The only thing which could be said in defense of the replacement is the fact that the actual sex-scene from VN was also insulting, out of character and degrading to women. But certainly it doesn't justify horridness of the replacement. Shame on you, ufotable.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the above maybe wouldn't be that annoying if only the action part of the second season was any good. It isn't. Most fights are static, anti-climactic and/or resolved too fast and constantly interrupted by excessive talking. I must also note uninspired choreography and lackluster design of some of the characters outfits. What's really weird - many earlier ones are actually not that bad, but in this anime the more important given fight is the more underwhelming it will be. Very peculiar and quite infuriating. The Gilgamesh's way of fighting is partially to blame for that, but still, zero imagination on the creators' side certainly doesn't help. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary: the series obscures the strengths of original novel (entertaining premise, cool servants, fascinating fights, good side-characters, romance), instead it emphasizes its weaknesses (main story, Shirou), amplifying it by ridiculous amounts of \"tell, don't show\". And as a bonus it damages the society by promoting petite bourgeois morality. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, this show is nothing more than a proof that world doesn't need any more Fate/Stay Night adaptations.",

            "content": "When news about this series was launched, I somewhat had mixed feelings; the original Fate/Stay Night was so horrible, I pity myself for watching it, while Fate/Zero was absolutely fantastic, plus Ufotable, responsible for Fate/Zero, were producing it.\r\nThat brings me to Fate/Stay Night UBW.\r\nIn short, I'd say that this series was absolutely stunning. I'm so glad it didn't turn out like the 2006 one.\r\nStory- 8\r\nGranted, the story was not as compelling as Fate/Zero. However, I was deeply surprised by the dark elements that were introduced. The 2006 one felt like a sad piece of shit, where viewers are supposed to feel sorry for Shiro throughout,for being the absolute dimwit he is. Rather than a hopeless romance that Stay Night (2006) was, UBW is more focused on progress and action sequences.  UBW might not have an extremely good story line, but it is fairly entertaining, without the presence of any loopholes.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10\\n\r\nOne word. Beautiful. Ufotable probably produces the most beautiful and amazingly stunning visuals I have ever seen to date. If Fate/Zero amazed me, this has managed to surpass even that in terms of animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10\\n\r\nBoth opening soundtracks, especially Brave Shine, have found themselves cemented on my playlist. Sound effects, outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 7\\n\r\nIf this anime has even a small flaw, this might be it. Obviously, this was a HUGE step up from the 2006 version, but it did lack character depth. Characters like Kirei, Ilya and Saber could have added more to the show, and I would have preferred slightly more prominent roles (but then again, it might not have been that way in the visual novel). The apparent lack of a distinguished antagonist didn't help the cause. Kirei was the perfect antagonist in Fate/Zero, so I was expecting quite a lot from him in this as well (as this was supposed to be a direct sequel). Nevertheless, the annoying character of Tohsaka Rin has had a huge improvement, and she is pretty likable now. The most significant change I've seen in terms of character, is Shiro's. The hopelessly pathetic sorry piece of shit in Fate/Stay Night (2006) has turned out to be full badass in UBW; I hated him in the 2006 one, and was quite disappointed that he wasn't killed off by the end. However, his UBW character is the definition of a shounen anime/manga protagonist; it's as if his UBW character was finally provided with some balls, which the original clearly lacked.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9\\n\r\nIt's one of the few anime I've really enjoyed in 2014-15. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9\\n\r\nGive it a watch if you're in for a ride.\\n\\n\r\n(P.S. Some of the subs don't make even the slightest of senses, so bear with it, or wait for it to be updated with better translations)",

            "content": "Ever since I first watched Fate/Stay Night anime, I got hooked. A lot of people were complaining how it didn't live up to their expectations especially the ones who played the Visual Novel before, but as someone who didn't, I quite enjoyed the anime a bit. Of course afterwards I immediately went to play the game, and I managed to only finish the Fate route for some reason. Then I went to explore a bit for other TYPE-MOON series and discovering Tsukihime and Kara no Kyoukai, which the latter is one of my all time favorite.\r\nNow for years people have been saying that Unlimited BladeWorks is the best TYPE-MOON story in the game, and how amazing it is and that it is levels above the Fate route. So of course, an anime adaptation at last of the best route should be pretty enetertaining - and it was.\\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade Works is about a boy named Shirou with a strong sense of justice, and selfless boy who rarely or almost never says no to anyone. He gets pulled into a sort of an age-old ritual, where the Holy Grail chooses Masters which in turn they summon servants, who are heroic spirits from the past (ex. Heracles, Gilgamesh, King Arthur etc.) to aid them in their quest. It is said that the Grail can grant the winner any wish he desires\\n\\n\r\nNow, the plot sounds very interesting - and it is, especially when in the series we get to see some famous and interesting characters from other tales we heard like Heracles and King Arthur. The series also has some high quality animation with flawless character designs, ways improved from the past adaptations. However, as far as the OST goes, I must say I prefered the version of the 2006 Fate/Stay Night adaptations, especially the opening \"Kirameku Namida wa Hoshi ni\", one of my favorite anime openings. I never skipped listening to it in Fate, while here I always skipped them.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Unlimited Blade Works is not without flaws. I felt like a lot of people expressed in their opinions that some episodes were very rushed, and it seemed like a lot of it was cutout. The fight scenes were very impressive, however the constant dialogue and flashbacks occuring ruined the intensity which resulted in being a little anti-climatic. The main character doesn't just suffer from the typical idealistic shounen character views as to \"save everyone without anyone getting hurt\", but also suffers from out of nowhere \"power-ups\" like how he could fight on equal footing with the Heroic Spirits and even defeat them, when he didn't really have that much time to properly train. I can see why many people would dislike Shirou also because other supporting characters are much more interesting than him, like Archer, Gilgamesh and Lancer (Lancer suddenly acting out of character and dying for Rin and all, what the hell was that about? It didn't give a proper explanation for his actions).\\n\\n\r\nHis idealistic views can be considered childish, especially in the world we live in today, with all the corruption, terrorism, crime and povery all over the world. The truth is you can't save everyone which is why a lot of people failed to symphatize with our main character. Rin also sometimes annoyed me with the over-used high-pitched voice tsundere archetype. However I must admit I admired how sometimes straight forward Shirou was with expressing his feelings for Rin and how she gets all flustered and embarrased, it was pretty funny.\\n\\n\r\nI felt a little backstory on some characters would have made the show more entertaining and we could have connected with the characters more. I would have liked to see some Gilgamesh, Lancer, Caster and Heracles backstory. Also Rider felt like it barely was part of the series. By the second season I completely forgot about her. \\n\\n\r\nStill, this was a pretty entertaining and fun ride. It had a lot of potential and great build up, but it ended up being anti-climatic and a little rushed, but the the ending was satisfying and a happy one. I admit I expected a lot more since as I said, for years I've been told that Unlimited Blade Works is the best damn thing TYPE-MOON came out with, but it was still good. The other Fate anime defiinitely had more memorable moments but every fan of the Fate series and TYPE-MOON has to watch this. Maybe it's time to resume playing the game for me and finish UBW and Heaven's feel route.",

            "content": "The Fate series holds a very special place in my heart, the escapades of Shirou Emiya and his servant Saber have enthralled me in a way that a lot of stories did not. From the romance in \"Fate\" to the climatic \"Heaven's Feel\", Fate/stay night hasn't just become one of my favorite stories, it's honestly become my favorite thing to come out of Japan.\r\nTo give you a bit of background as to where I stand with Fate, I have read the visual novel and its semi-sequel multiple times, I have seen and own the 2006 anime, the prequel Fate/Zero, and the 2010 film adaptation ofthis anime's route. So (not to toot my horn) but I think I have at least a fair understanding of the Fate universe, and from a fan's standpoint I can say without a doubt that this is an excellent adaptation of \"Unlimited Blade Works\".\\n\\n\r\nWhereas the 2006 anime adaptation was mostly based on the 1st route (entitled \"Fate\"), but added elements of the other 2 routes which turned it into a strange mix (and pissed off a good deal of fans), this adaptation sticks completely to the \"Unlimited Blade Works\" route while adding some anime original material to add more to the story. Now as the Fate series is based around the concept of the Holy Grail War, \"Unlimited Blade Works\" is probably the most war-less of the 3 routes, with the main conflict being a clash of ideologies rather than swords (although there is a fair bit of those as well). It is in this that the anime can be at its most exciting... or its most tedious as the anime is very dialogue heavy, and while I myself loved each conversation, not everyone will be as enthralled.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned above that I felt that this anime was an excellent adaptation of the source material, and I believe that to be true, however that's not to say that the source material itself is perfect. As much as I love the \"Unlimited Blade Works\" route, I cannot deny when there are flaws with the story, and there are a few. There are many instances where characters seem to be coated in layers of \"Plot Armor\", some story details don't make very much sense, and side-characters are thrown to the side just to be picked back up for relevance later on. That being said I do think the story presented here is very strong, having a tense beginning, plenty of twists and turns,and having what I believe to be one of the most satisfying conclusions to an anime that I've seen in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, the anime is populated with them, with the main focus being on our quartet. Saber is definitely the least developed out of the 4, as her story was the main focus of the 1st route, where she was also the love interest. That's not to say that she's a bad character here though, but her role is definitely toned down to being a nurturing friend. She conveys a very warm presence and is very welcome in the story. (There's also the fact that she may or may not be my favorite love interest of the franchise, and all anime in general.) Rin Tohsaka on the other hand is the main love interest, and as such gets the most screentime with our protagonist. She definitely has a very strong attitude and way of thinking, and has a lot of depth underneath what some would consider a tsundere personality. Her relationship with Shirou is also well done at points, but can be tedious if your not into teasing and excessive blushing.\\n\\n\r\nRin's servant Archer is the perfect definition of a badass, (You ever hear of the GAR meme? It came from him.) making short work of enemies with ease, with a smirk on his face. He could also be considered the deuteragonist of the series, with a good portion of the show being focused on his back story and overall mystery, adding a good layer of depth and being the focus of the show's most exciting conflicts. Then we have our protagonist, Shirou Emiya. The view of his character is very divisive within the anime community; some view him as an incredibly interesting character, others find him to be incredibly idiotic, I myself lean towards the former. Its hard to portray a character like Shirou in an adaptation as most of his character is shown through endless monologues in the visual novel, but putting that into an anime would grind the pacing to a halt. This results in a mixed bag from both anime watchers and visual novel players, but I personally found his character to be handled as good as it could for an anime adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nStudio Ufotable (the animators behind The Garden of Sinners and Fate/Zero) return to the Fate series and they return in style. The animation in this series is some of the best I've ever seen, with the entire series looking like 1 massive movie (leading to some to call this \"Unlimited Budget Works\"). The action sequences are absolutely jaw dropping, with characters zipping all over the screen with the jarring clashing of swords, its truly amazing stuff. It's not only the animation and the action that's great, the backgrounds are also stunning, with the art designers doing their best to create a photo-realistic representation of Japan, I'd get framed wallpapers of some of these backdrops.\\n\\n\r\nOn the music we have Hideyuki Fukasawa, composer of the other Type-Moon visual novel Witch on the Holy Night and the 2013 anime Flowers of Evil. Whereas most anime composers tend to create a few tracks and constantly replay them throughout a show, Fukasawa has decided to do something different : film scoring, having new music play throughout each episode. (That's 26 episodes filled with original music, 3 of which are an hour long. That's a lot of music.) His method is certainly ambitious, but how is his actual score? I found his score to be excellent, maintaining a consistent quality throughout the entire series. His action set-pieces filled me with adrenaline, his emotional moments moved me, and his renditions of of the classic visual novel music are just pure bliss.\\n\\n\r\nFate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works] is not a perfect anime, nothing is. Some characters are flawed, story details don't make sense sometimes, and the pacing can feel really jumbled at some points. With that being said however, I've come to love this adaptation just as much, if not more than its visual novel counterpart. I came into this series expecting the core story of \"Unlimited Blade Works\" to be told in the anime format, and Ufotable has done that and so much more. I have enjoyed this series from beginning to end, not once feeling bored or let down throughout all of its 26 episodes. I cannot recommend this enough, why wouldn't I? It has become my favorite anime I've seen thus far after all.",

            "content": "\"Just because you're correct doesn't mean you're right!\"\r\nThe legendary words of Shirou Emiya have spread far and wide around the world ever since the 2006 adaptation of Fate/Stay Night with his infamous \"people die when they are killed\", and now our frustrating hero is back with more internal contradictions and bullshit ideals than ever. Through the course of Unlimited Blade Works one can watch Shirou go through the difficult process of realizing that his ideals are not only absurd but also simply borrowed from his father in a series of powerful scenes such as \"saying the same thing to Archer for two episodes,\" \"never talkingto Saber,\" \"flirting with full-on tsundere Rin\" and \"fighting all-powerful heroic spirits with some swords he made, somehow.\"\\n\\n\r\nNow I want to be clear about one thing upfront. Unlimited Blade Works was FUN. It was fun for nearly the entirety of its run. It's legendary to-die-for animation done by Ufotable, Lord of Action made sure that every single fight scene (of which there were plenty) was pretty much like getting an injection of cocaine. The story was rarely stagnant, always throwing itself onwards and upwards with more heroic spirits, more noble phantasms, and more right-before-death backstories. There were plenty of delightful cameos from all over the Fate universe, there were just enough scenes involving bro Lancer and SAO villain Shinji, and there was everyone's favorite Arthurian legend yelling \"EXCALYBIUUUUUU\" at just the right moments. For me this is definitely a show to be watched with friends, especially those who already have some background in Type Moon's elaborate universe, but that's not a requirement.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I can't say that I wasn't disappointed as well. As someone who came into the Type Moon universe through Fate/Zero, my expectations were fairly high. This was likely in part due to the fact that the writer for Fate/Zero was Gen Urobuchi, as the lending of his ideas and philosophies to the story made the inevitable monologuing between characters actually quite compelling. Basically, Fate/Zero was a fantasy epic: a fun, gorgeous, over-the-top battle royal marked by compelling characters arcs, sharp-enough writing, and a crescendoing conclusion that kept you on the edge of your seat and felt truly earned by the development that had been interwoven throughout the show, making full use of the show's slow start. It was fun, definitely, but is was also GOOD; it was akin to Game of Thrones for me and I loved it. When it was announced that Ufotable was adapting Unlimited Blade Works into a TV series of similar length, I was ecstatic. The epic could continue. Grown-up Rin and Sakura having to clean up after their fathers to try and stop the all-powerful Gilgamesh Reborn and his sociopathic sidekick Kotomine? Sounds AMAZING. I already found all of those characters compelling, I couldn't wait to see what kind of creative development had occurred during the time skip, and I was practically drooling for more Gilgamesh. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I got instead was pretty much a wall of orgasmic fight animation and a plethora of awesome one liners. And not much else. \\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade Work's most fatal shortcoming is without a doubt the lack of a strong supporting cast. In contrast to Zero where characters were like to discuss their philosophies and ambitions while facing off, in Blade Works they usually just talk about their power levels and abilities and how much they are going to win. Because of this we don't really get much of an insight into the minds of very many heroes and masters, and that leaves us feeling less like we're watching the battle royal that the Grail War is in which many different sides compete for different reasons for their own all-important causes, and instead watching \"the adventures of Shirou, Rin, and Saber when she talks occasionally.\" Usually the only time in which the other masters and their spirits get development is through flashbacks that show us little about who they are now, just who they were, and often take place right before their deaths as if they are shoehorned in there just to make us care at the moment we're supposed to. That's not how it works: you can't make me care about a character by killing them, you have to make me care enough about them before anything happens to them that I don't want them to die in the first place. There's no tact to the way that the story unfolds: it's pretty much broken up into chunks in which the protagonists deal with struggles of increasing difficulty, and the other characters pretty much wait their turn until it is time for them to appear and have their chunk of time, forcing all of their development into this conveniently blocked-out area. That's not how good storytelling works: you have to weave these strands together from the beginning, slowly building the characters and the nature of their struggles until these arcs begin to culminate. Unlimited Blade Works does not do this, and when the second half comes and it starts pulling off its big moments, they aren't really all that big because they rely on elements that are essentially introduced on the spot. We aren't watching the satisfying culmination of previously set-up story elements, we're watching what in another show might be an outstanding scene if it had and prior weight to back it.\\n\\n\r\nWith the lack of a strong supporting cast, the burden of the story falls almost entirely to our screen-hogging duo, Rin and Shirou, and their heroic spirits Archer and Saber. Saber's been around before, and her story is FASCINATING: last time, we left off with her realizing that it was her own martyrdom that made her fail as a leader, then she was forced to destroy her one piece of hope to change that and sent back to the waiting place to despair over her failure. Now she's back, and all i want to see is how she's changed, how she's going to express those changes, what kind of path she's decided to take now, etc. But do we get any of that? Ever? Not in Unlimited Blade Works at least: Saber is pretty much a side show and a fighting tool, throwing around her epic city-leveling noble phantasm when necessary and besides that just quietly telling Shirou that she'll protect him and eating his sandwiches in silence. Rin takes her place as a female lead, doing everything she can to keep the audience emotionally invested, and at first she does a pretty good job: the hour-long prologue is amazingly good, especially for her character, and at first her drive in the Grail War and her distant yet not completely uncaring relationship with Shirou are the makings of a strong lead and potentially tragic adversary. However, it's not a particularly long period of time before the entirely of Rin's character can be summed up in two lines:\\n\r\n       - Knows useful things about magic\\n\r\n       - Is a tsundere\\n\r\nIt's tragic, really, and while her character never really makes the story drag she doesn't really do much to make it compelling either. By the end she's mostly defined by Shirou, talking almost exclusively about his struggles and internal contradictions, blushing aggressively at times and telling him how to use magic the other times. I feel like the show almost forgot about her own extremely passionate desire to uphold her father's name and avenge his death, and she seemed to have most of her complexity sucked out of her.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to Shirou & Archer. I don't want to go to far into them for the sake of avoiding spoilers, but the show is essentially their story at this point, and as such it backs itself into a corner where they pretty much make it or break it. On the one hand, they make it: the ideas behind their characters and the philosophies that they espouse are fascinating, and the basis for both of them could be taken great places and no doubt was in the visual novel. However, they are undermined by a single factor: the writing in the show is appallingly bad. It's contrived, insultingly repetitive, watered-down and lacking in virtually any substance. This isn't helped by the fact that the story is disjointed and poorly-organized. Combined, these shortcomings inflict irreparable damage both to these two characters and to the show as a whole, and now we're back to the beginning:\\n\\n\r\nThe show is fun to watch. That's about it. It has phenomenal animation, plenty of hilariously cheesy lines, a beautiful soundtrack including a second opening that will never get out of your head (Brave SHINNEE!!), scenes that should be too stupid to exist, and have I mentioned the art yet? However, unlike Zero, it is no longer seriously compelling, it no longer earns emotional engagement, and it loses much of the epic feeling of the story through lack of proper buildup and insane excuses for writing. This would have been more bearable if it wasn't supposedly a sequel to one of the greatest fantasy epics of our time: this was like watching the Phantom Menace or the Hobbit movies and watching characters that I loved and cared about get tossed around by some insane director until they were reduced to poorly-written shadows of their former selves. On it's own, it's a blast, but as a sequel to Zero it's a disappointment. This is in no way an attack on the source material: the story that was trying to be told seemed to be one of merit, but it was slaughtered ONCE AGAIN (Fate/StayNight cannot catch a break) by appalling execution. The budget might be higher than Japan's GDP this time, the voice acting may be superb, the music hype (apparently several songs from the visual novels were pulled and used in the show) but the pacing and arrangement of the story combined with the terrible writing (as well as a few scenes that were just straight-up adapted awfully) made Unlimited Budget Works into a bit of a letdown and an unworthy successor of Fate/Zero. \\n\\n\r\nIf this is your introduction into the Type/Moon universe, you probably couldn't pick a better place to start. This show is incredibly fun by itself, and when you've finished it everything else you watch will exceed your expectations (except the 2006 Fate/StayNight) whether it be the mighty prequel or the acclaimed Garden of Sinners or the soon-to-be Heaven's Feel and Hollow Ataraxia. However, if you liked or loved Zero for any of the reasons I did and you've been waiting until this show finishes to decide whether to watch it or not, I must unfortunately advise you to stay away from it. The closure it provides for Zero isn't good enough to warrant tainting the characters/story. You're better off with the strong yet open ending of Zero. Watch Garden of Sinners instead, or wait for Heaven's Feel and hope that they get a different writer and director.",

            "content": "The first cour had a great progress. However, it declined a bit this second cour.\r\nWe had more action and character development. Giving focus mainly on the clash between Shirou and Archer. The animation in general was very good, just gave a fallen light in some scenes, but nothing too serious. In this adaptation of Fate managed to convey very well what the Visual novel wanted to spend. It was not a 100% faithful adaptation (maybe 90% faithful ), but unlike the previous studio, that enriched the story, adding more detail and develop harmoniously. We have seen some situations from the perspectives of other characters likeas Illya, Saber and Caster.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I loved in this adaptation was the constant use of symbolism to represent the feelings and suffering of the characters. I also really enjoyed the monologues placed in the anime, especially in flashbacks of Archer.\\n\\n\r\nMy complaints with the anime are relative to some anti-climatic cuts, which in some episodes totally broke the climate of the previous episode (or previous scene). A serious error direction.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I did not like, was again forgetting some important explanations, which have not been placed, left the anime with some information missing. Not are things so serious, but would have left the anime with a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several opinions about the protagonist. I can not hate him ... he just follows what he believe is right, however this is wrong. He does not care about the opinions of others, and has no regrets what he does. This can be seen by many peoples as something stupid, but in my viewpoint, I just see someone following and believing what think it's correct, hypocritical or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime ended in a very pleasant way, with an epilogue going on two years after the war and showing a bit of life of the protagonists after that. We had a surprise appearance of a character who was present during the Fate/Zero events.\\n\\n\r\nAs a general, the anime was not something completely spectacular, but just something good which provided striking scenes and interesting characters. 8/10\\n\\n",

Some moments did seize the opportunity to surprise out of nowhere and that was the beauty of season two unlike season one there was the element of surprise that you sort of expected in a way (I know what the heck does that mean) but if you watched season one which you must of if your reading this review, there are moments that will surprise out of nowhere so be prepared. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all this anime lives up to be a good season two or squeal (if that floats your boat) for anime that has a rich history of being a top notch animation technique accompanied by actionful ( made up word of the week ) scene covered in frosting of drama and feels but is  good enough to live up to the legend of season two good enough to watch rather than reading or watching the summery.\\n\\n\r\nSo Enjoy and adi\u00f3s.",

            "content": "This Review applies to both seasons of Unlimited Blade Works. The Video review is up on my channel, but here is the written.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nIf you\u2019re familiar with the Fate series, its pretty much is the same. But in Unlimited Blade Works it follows a different scenario. Sure the beginning is pretty much the same as it was in Fate/Stay Night, but the focus is much different. But to put you up to speed, 7 masters and heroic servants fight in the war to gain the ultimate wish fulfilling device known as the Holy Grail. The story this time around focuses a lot more onShirou, Rin and the mystery on her servant Archer. We never really got to know Archer all that well in the original Fate/Stay Night, but in Unlimited Blade Works, we see the trials and tribulations he had to go through to become a servant and when we learn where he comes from, we question if whatever he was doing was right or wrong, and we also see if it can be fixed.\\n\\n\r\nIn my personal opinion, I prefer the Unlimited Blade Works path over the Fate/Stay Night path. The story felt more believable and the relationships between the characters felt more natural and not as forced. The story does however have pacing issues, as for some parts it does drag and there a some moments that felt unneeded. It does have a slow start, especially if you start from episode 0 then watch episode 1 as they are 40 minute episodes also they\u2019re the exact same except, told through different perspectives. And it does suffer from the usual problem of a Fate series, if you\u2019re not familiar with the world, it\u2019s hard to follow and understand. However I must say, if you never watched the original Fate/Stay Night, before it\u2019s definitely ok to watch this adaptation, but it\u2019s sort of also made for those who watched Fate/Zero. The story is much more thought out in Unlimited Blade Works, and the writing is more consistent as the character interactions with each other, makes more sense than it did in the original.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nShirou Emiya returns as the main protagonist for Unlimited Blade Works. What I like about his character in this adaptation is that his is actually not an idiot. Shirou is actually more competent in this adaptation than the original, he respects those around him and acknowledges their powers and he also a better learner in magic, which makes him more formidable in battle, compared to his dumb luck in the original. Shirou does however still retain his sense of justice, as he believes what he is doing is right, despite what is shown around him, yet he continues forward with his views. He just wants to be a Hero of Justice, and save as many people as he can. \\n\\n\r\nSaber returns, but rather than a main role she has more of supporting role this time around. And personality is a bit different than the original. For instance she is more cool and calm than before but also more cooperative. She has a more chilled personality than the serious Saber, don\u2019t get me wrong she still goes serious in fights, but outside of that she has a more approachable personality, and she so adorable in this adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nRin Tohsaka take the role as main female protagonist. Rin serves more a purpose in this adaptation as she trains and gives Shirou the ins and outs of the Holy Grail War. She does in this adaptation, show more interest in him, and you can see this further down the track and the reason for it. She is a competent mage, showing high level of strategy in different situations despite the odds. And her relationship with Shirou felt much more natural, rather than forced. I like how in this adaptation she is given more purpose, but also better explained behind her motivations.\\n\\n\r\nThe true star of this adaptation is Archer. Archer\u2019s backstory is delved into much more detail. His origin story is probably the biggest twist in the series and you\u2019re just so sucked in by his misfortunes and you feel sorry for the guy. He fights for his beliefs despite if it\u2019s wrong, but is correct. At the same time he\u2019s still a badass and probably gets the most time to shine in action scenes. Archer plays more of an anti-hero in this adaptation and his interactions with Shirou gets really interesting later on, as we see why he has an interest in Shirou.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course I want to talk about my personal favourite servant, Gilgamesh who returns with a bigger role than original Fate. Gilgamesh is given more of the overall antagonist of this adaptation. And he\u2019s still as arrogant and badass as ever. The only thing about him in this adaptation, is that we don\u2019t see him in his armour. Despite this retains his arrogant high chair personality all the way to the end, which I why I love him as a villain.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all these great characters, some other characters this time around didn\u2019t get as much screen time as they did in the original. Some characters felt very pointless, because they hardly made an appearance at all and some backstory\u2019s were definitely left out to make way for our mains. But some characters also did get more time to shine than they did in the original. Some characters I was rather surprise, at first I didn\u2019t care for Caster, but after seeing her backstory, I felt a bit sorry for her, same for Ilya especially after I found out what happened to her. The characters this time did touch more heart a bit, but some of the development and lead ups to was very slow. The main, despite being developed quite well apart from Saber, who pretty much wasn\u2019t developed that much at all, it was kind of slow and of course it\u2019s going to be slow, because it\u2019s 26 episodes long, including episode 0.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 10/10, 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you have been hearing of this show being called Unlimited Budget Works, you are not wrong, it is literally unlimited budget works. The animation is dropped dead gorgeous, the special effects look amazing the particles look incredible as well. The action scenes are probably the best animated sequences I have seen in anime, the fights are well choreographed to go with it as well. No scene is dropped with quality, everything runs very smoothly from frame to frame. The characters designs look much better than original as they look more realistic, they don\u2019t have a huge upper body like the original, but more even out. So much thought has been put into each action sequences, as they don\u2019t really repeat any animations at all and you especially see this when they\u2019re fighting in Archer\u2019s noble phantasm and Gilgamesh, when you see a lot of different designed weapons. The animation and art is amazing, when I saw Fate/Zero I wondered how are they going to top the animation, and Ufotable has pulled off something amazing in Unlimited Blade Works. It really felt like their budget is unlimited, they pretty gave everything detail even if it\u2019s the littlest of things.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is as enjoyable. It\u2019s still does a great job of complimenting the anime, there some very nice orchestral music to complement each scenario plus there is the added touch of electro here and there. However the soundtrack compared to Fate/Zero doesn\u2019t have the epic feel towards it, there is really not that much epic choir to go with the music. Which could\u2019ve made some scenes better, it was good, it just wasn\u2019t epic. The opening themes are good, they do their jobs, the animation for it however is great, just like the whole show. Same things can be said for the ending, they do their jobs and a good, but not really as memorable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWatching Unlimited Blade Work did feel like re-watching the original Fate, so some episodes, I was like oh my god, I\u2019m watching it over again, except the animation is better. I did enjoy the show a lot more than original fate, as I preferred this path over that. The relationship between characters made more sense and I like the character interactions more than the original. The most enjoyment I got in this show was watching the gorgeous visuals and action scenes. Whenever I was watching Unlimited Blade Works, I did not want to watch another anime, in knowing this is probably the best animated series to date. The action scenes are very cool and the fact that the story focuses on characters I was more interested in made it a huge plus. The only thing that sort of disappointed me was that some characters were given less to work with this time around, and it\u2019s a shame because I think all the characters deserve to shine.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the story of Unlimited Blade Works, I give it and an 8, as the backstory behind Archer was really interesting the theme behind doing what\u2019s right was really motivating as well. The writing made more sense this time around and it was good story. The story does suffer from the usual Fate problems, with an uneven pacing and hard to read concept.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound I give it a 10 and 7. The animation is amazing to look at, it really highlights what ufotable can do. The world looks amazing to the smallest detail. Each action scene is gorgeous to look at from the dust particles to the specials effects and the choreograph fights are amazing as well. However the sound, despite being a good soundtrack really lacked the epicness that we got from Fate/Zero, but unfortunately I didn\u2019t find the opening and ending themes as memorable.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters I give it an 8, the characters were much improved from the original. Shirou was more competent. But it\u2019s the interaction between the characters that really shined, Shirou and Rin\u2019s interaction felt more natural, and same with Saber. Archer had a very interesting past, which is pretty much the focus of the show.  A lot of characters got to shine, but then again, a lot of characters didn\u2019t, which is unfortunate because I loved some of these characters whether it was from Fate/Zero or Fate/Stay Night (2006). \\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment I have to give it a 8. Because I did enjoy it more than the original, but at times it just felt like I was re-watching the whole series again, since I have an idea of what\u2019s to come. The action scenes are amazing to look at, but there were a few problems in the story pacing you just want to end so you can watch the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAfter rounding it all up, I give Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works an 8/10. The animation is amazing great, however they could\u2019ve added more to their presentation, because the soundtrack was not as memorable. The story is improved and the character interactions are better as well. I recommended Unlimited Blade Works to an fans of the Fate Series, but also especially recommend it to action fans, as the animation for the fight scenes are gorgeous, you\u2019re just going to get caught up in the world. \\n",

            "content": "Warning: Partial spoilers for Epilogue\r\nI gotta say I love the sunset fading to night scene leading to the ending credits. It makes the viewer actually feel like they are experiencing that world in real time alongside those characters. Something about it was too beautiful to put into words. Guess you could say it's a perfect way to end a thought provoking epilogue that makes you think twice about dropping out of school. Right before, Rin was saying there is so much in the world that is worth suffering for and experiencing, so it was worth dropping their things and taking a risk going off thenormal path. It takes the point home when you see the view from a small dorm room to the city landscape. And of course the night sky which is limitless and transcends every era of time like Saber's. I don't know if anyone noticed this yet: In the end, I think it is very likely they were trying to give weight to the title. Rin talks about their fate and staying together, which is followed by the night sky. Fate/Stay Night. Voila!\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I felt the second cour was mediocre as an adaption. I could tell the epilogue would have complimented a good adaptation very well, but it feels slightly out of line because it feels deeper than the previous episodes, which had no substance and lack of characterization. The conversation/monologues they had at Saber's grave site and just Shirou talking to himself is a great example of what the series was seriously lacking for VN viewers. There was really no good reason to leave those things out when they have so much time to fill with anime original scenes and this epilogue which is basically all original. So the ending feels less impactful than what was probably intended. I'd call this adaptation a tragedy because it was a wasted opportunity which took a decade to become a reality. Heaven's Feel next, which will have a lot less hype now because UfoUBW technically dropped the ball.",

            "content": "*spoilers down below for the review of this series*\r\nHere's going to be my Fate/stay Night Unlimited Blade Works anime review as a whole. Now before anyone goes and attacks me, just because either of my rating score or my review, keep in mind what I will say first. The series is pretty much debatable, people can like it, people can despise it. There's an amount of people that goes and tries to debate on the show, me personally, as a person who likes this series, I won't take the show as a masterpiece, because it's not even a 10/10. And if there are people fromthe Fate/Zero franchise that goes and attacks me as well, keep in mind in here as well what I have to say. I do not like Fate/Zero at the end of the day, but it does not mean that its a bad series. The reason why I prefer UBW in terms of conclusion is because for me it actually had at least a satisfying ending. I know, Fate/Zero ending was incomplete, but that was before I even knew there were other routes. And I still feel like I didn't like Fate/Zero. But the same score went for F/Z and F/SN UBW as a whole series completely. \\n\\n\r\nPlease keep that in mind that this is just one person's opinion, nothing too groundbreaking that could be considered a disease but neither to the point of fangirling towards the point I call a series a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a sequel to Fate/Zero, Fate/stay Night Unlimited Blade Works brings the continuation but rather with a different protagonist, Emiya Shirou, who then became the new master of Saber since it was passed 10 years. As the time passed by, we get to see some bits of things going on around the series. The first half of the show was alright but its just because I couldn't see the character development of the main protagonist. We see Shirou following the ideal that he grasped but doesn't take the consideration in the first half that what he would be causing is pain to himself. The second half of the series was more fleshed out in his character, as I look at the both perspective point of view of the same Ideal between Archer and Shirou. Archer its one of the characters that had the same ideal, but as the time passed, he slowly started to regret taking this specific ideal. For Emiya Shirou on the other hand, he takes this ideal as a beautiful thing because he wants to save innocent lives. The story progressed smoothly and gives us some things to understand this conflict. In the end of the day the ending of the show can be interpreted as one of the worst endings, or one of the most satisfying endings. But how can I call this anime series ending? Well in short, from what I can see Shirou will continue to follow the same ideal, but, he will never become like Archer (terms of guardian). So in the end he decided to take a different direction while keeping the ideal he got.\\n\\n\r\nMy only issue with the story is that for me some of the exposition or the info dumping may ticked me off. But then again this isn't the greatest story ever. But it kept what it needed to be.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAs stated the characters would be a weaker part of the series just because they don't get well developed, but if I think about it in a perspective, then the characters were already developed in Fate/Zero. I don't have any type of issue, but that's just me though. My issue with the show is because they give so little screentime for these characters in this series, that sometimes snaps me out. But regardless there are characters that got developed. \\n\\n\r\nEmiya Shirou developed as a character, which is the strongest center part. He learns from his ideal and his consequences, and decided to then take another path though he continues to follow the ideal.\\n\\n\r\nIllya got developed in the show as well, but the issue was the same as stated in the first paragraph. She was given little time to become around that it ticked me off.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that I still like the characters, even though some didn't fleshed out so much in this whole series, I guess you can say its department is decent in a sense.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHere are the good parts of the series which most people would agree with me for the most part. The art and animation was made by Ufotable, the same studio behind shows such as the Kara no Kyoukai movies and Fate/Zero, which this doesn't let me down. They have the \"Unlimited Budget Works\" throughout the whole anime series. I really like how they use the color pallet of the series, and especially with the effects of the weapons, the CGI looks very nice and also when it comes to battles, especially with Gilgamesh, they give impressive angles in the whole anime series. This is the strongest part of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music department is rather very solid and show fitting, which for me the OST fits very well with the series. From heart warming to tension rising, even fighting OSTs. They use the instrumental approach, which is very nice from them to use.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBesides those little flaws, I simply enjoyed a lot on UBW. This is a manner of preferences but I think the enjoyment factor on the series is very much what I didn't thought it had. Entertaining fights, marvelous animation, the amazing soundtrack, and such ends.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.8/10 (Round to an 8)\\n\\n\r\nFor me personally, Unlimited Blade Works got the flaws, and I can't deny that. But it was simply one enjoyable experience. As stated this is an opinion regarding on my thoughts. So if you disagree I'm fine with that. \\n\\n",

            "content": "For visual novel readers and anime-only watchers alike, the attraction of the Ufotable-Type Moon pair-up is obvious.  Nasu's highly intricate and appealing designs brought to life by Ufotable, who are excellent in visuals and art.  This partnership works to great extent but was unfortunately lacking in the other important components such as character development, relatability and execution of the story that are needed to create a compelling narrative.\r\nThe problems have mostly to do with the conversion from one medium to another.  Visual novels thrive on details, through the use of monologue while anime simply thrives on visual gimmicks.  In essence, readingVNs require a very long attention span, while anime caters to those who want instant visual stimulation.  Going straight to the point, anime as a medium is appealing to those with shorter attention spans.  Converting a details-heavy story into an anime therefore has its problems and UBW is yet another adaptation which falls into this trap.\\n\\n\r\nIt is no surprise that the anime felt hollow, especially in the second season.  The anime misses out a lot of highly important dialogue that fleshes out emotions meaning we never got to fully understand the characters.  Servants and masters with their own deep thoughts and motives simply became cannonfodder in the anime.  What was a carefully crafted setup to a fight simply became \"Boom!  Explosions!  Blood!  Dead!\".  While the anime keeps the very barebones of the story intact, the lack of detail really removes any chance of forming connections with characters.  This also reduces the \"shock value\" when a certain character gets killed off.  In the end the anime becomes a \"sit down, watch explosions, the end\" experience.\\n\\n\r\nExcept it even fails on that regard.  There are long moments in the middle of battles where the characters simply stand up and recite lines from the VN.  Details is good, no?  Except that it fails to satisfy neither VN or anime medium fans.  The dialogue is too shallow and brief for VN fans while anime-watchers are treated with info-dumps which exceed their attention spans, and their craving for explosions go unsatisfied.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the amazing story that is UBW can only be told in one medium.  The VN medium, as animation as a medium is incapable of telling a deep narrative, nor do their fandom want it.  This makes the VN and VN fandom objectively superior to anime and anime fandom.  For those distinguished people who want a complete experience, please go read the VN, for it is far deeper than any anime out there which thrives on the gimmicks of explosions, moe and fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nSome say VNs are too hipster, but hipster anime also exist.  The Aria the Animation franchise is highly popular and acclaimed by hipsters.  However, this should never be watched or supported for it really is only fanservice, with unrealistically proportioned hips and costumes to suit those with a leg fetish.  The hipster of anime comes nowhere near close to the hipster of all VNs; Asairo and Subarashiki Hibi.  Now, this is a true masterpiece in narrative and execution that no anime comes close to, and will never come close to in the future.",

Did ufotable have to faithfully adapt every wheel-spinning two hour conversation in which Pollyanna protagonist Shirou is repeatedly called a dweeb for his goofy idealism? Did they have to make sure we were reminded what a complete loser Archer is every time he appears, legs spread like his balls are prickly pears, perched on some conveniently placed rubble? What is actually appealing about Archer when his only major personal distinction from fellow Fate/stay night snarkster Lancer is his adolescent moralnihilism? What is there to admire about a character who is so unimaginative that his inner world is literally a wasteland full of imitation swords? Why do people like Archer?\\n\\n\r\nWhy did ufotable pick the route where the mid-boss is Caster and the teacher with the upside-down glasses? How did they fail so hard at making a pair of cynical murderers interesting? Why include a half-hearted tribute episode to the tragic homunculus Illya in the route where Illya and her Servant, Berserker, are a mere afterthought, as though ufotable realised that she deserved more attention than Caster ever did? Why couldn't we just have had the Berserker vs. Saber fight like in the Fate route? Why couldn't they at least have spared a thought for the narrative arc of poor neglected Saber, left to wilt after the misery she withstood in Fate/zero? Why did every free second of this show have to be filled with endless identical monologues about youthful idealism?\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, what is even the point of adapting a route where breakout character and franchise cash-cow Saber is fully relegated to the background throughout and possesses barely any agency of her own? Why did they retain the awful premature ejaculation of an ending, in which school rapist Shinji turns into the Smooze and Shirou has the worst fight ever with the supposed King of Heroes, Gilgamesh, who can't even be bothered to change out of his chavvy streetclothes? What kind of action anime peaks with two angry men yelling repetitive dialogue at each other while swords fly everywhere? Why is Saber's only half-decent action scene a stilted sword battle with a literal fake Servant whose entire shtick adds up to a convoluted version of the air conditioner's dilemma in The Brave Little Toaster (I was designed to stick in a temple! I like being stuck in this stupid temple!)?\\n\\n\r\nWhy was the last episode an OVA set in a twee version of London? Why is this new environment merely used to stage an oh-shucks cameo from Luvia and an extended moment of incredulous Jaden Smith-esque brain-death from Shirou as he spews all over Saber's dimly remembered non-heroics by wondering how it could be that history is real if English people aren't real?\\n\\n\r\nWhy do people like Unlimited Blade Works? How was this better than the Studio DEEN anime besides its production values? Is it really any less slow and repetitive? What is there to like about Shirou's stupid, abortive psychodrama? Is it just Rin? Is that it? If so, how can you account for the horrible, horrible reality that this route isn't even about Rin so much as it is about Shirou literally talking to himself for hours and hours only to come to the same conclusion with which he began? Is she really worth it, guys? Is it really worth *this*? Really?\\n\\n\r\nI hope you're all happy, Tohsaka fans. Go cross-dress in some thigh-highs and hate yourselves, you failures. Roll on Heaven's Feel.\\n\\n\r\nClarification edit: UBW does work well in the context of the VN, but holy holy it was a bad idea to adapt it straight.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nEveryone has their own set of convictions. Whether they are religiously, politically, or morally based, there are certain creeds that we, as individuals, follow. Depending on the ideals we hold, our very person is shaped, directing the lives we lead and the paths that we take. For me, I uphold a simple one: \u201ca little kindness goes a long way.\u201d So I try to do just that. I hold the door for others, give my thanks whenever I can, and call my family to check up on them. Small stuff, and probably pretty common too, butsuch actions have nonetheless made me into the kind of man that I am today, and hopefully who I\u2019ll be in the future. Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works 2nd season hones in on the convictions we maintain, but it never escapes its own faults to make its beliefs worth listening to.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nStay Night 2 follows immediately where the second season left off. Shirou and Rin are still fighting in the Holy Grail War, Servants and Masters work to take out their enemies, and all the while greater implications are brought to the forefront.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a well-known term in anime and other mediums where narratives are involved. It\u2019s a negative one that most sane plots try to avoid because they literally don\u2019t make sense. This term is called the \u201cplot contrivance.\u201d In short, it\u2019s an event that isn\u2019t fully explainable or even natural in the context of the show. Think \u201cdeus ex machina\u201d where some godlike figure descends from heaven, someone thought dead reappears alive, or a character magically gains a brand new ability out of nowhere. The reasoning behind it is usually \u201cjust because.\u201d Their existence is often the product of the author or director writing himself or herself into a corner, with the only option available being a free out that lacks any basis.\\n\\n\r\nStay Night 2 doesn\u2019t partake in plot contrivances, but it constantly finds itself one step before, dabbling in something very similar called \u201cconvenient inconveniences.\u201d What are these? They\u2019re inconvenient events that just so happen to occur at precisely the convenient time for the plot to move in the direction it wishes for it to go. They are just barely believable and only marginally rational. But it\u2019s evident that the plot is being forced down a specific path rather than occurring naturally. Many anime have this, but so long as they aren\u2019t particularly egregious, frequent, or otherwise palpable to the viewer, they can more or less be excused.\\n\\n\r\nWhat exactly constitutes as a \u201cconvenient inconvenience\u201d and what doesn\u2019t? Let\u2019s start with something that isn\u2019t. At one point, Shirou, Saber, and Lancer arrive once more at Illya\u2019s mansion to confront Archer who had kidnapped Rin. Saber decides that, instead of going to her Master\u2019s side \u2013 the logical conclusion \u2013 she will stay here and witness the fight between the two men, letting Lancer be the hero. This already sounds dangerous and stupid. Not having everyone available to save such an important person seems like a bad move. Thankfully, Saber\u2019s decision to not help Rin is justified; the battle between Archer and Shirou is an outward representation of Saber\u2019s inner struggle. Meaning, Saber\u2019s decision coincides with the progression of the adventure (and by extension her character) thus far.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what is a \u201cconvenient inconvenience?\u201d Following Archer\u2019s death, Gilgamesh is ready to face off against a questioning Saber, a distraught Rin, and a severely broken Shirou. However, Gilgamesh decides not to fight them because\u2026there\u2019s too much soot in the air. This perfectly captures the idea. Gilgamesh literally doesn\u2019t fight the damaged trio because there\u2019s too much dust around him. It\u2019s a silly justification because the audience expects this confrontation to happen now, especially given the circumstances. Instead, the plot is pushed down a path that feels as if the anime wants it to go there rather than letting it happen naturally.\\n\\n\r\nThe word \u201cconstantly\u201d was used earlier because Stay Night 2 encounters and intentionally dives into this pitfall far too often to go unnoticed. Gilgamesh doesn\u2019t kill Rin and Shirou at Illya\u2019s mansion the first time because he\u2019s \u201ctoo tired\u201d from fighting Berserker despite being the greatest Servant of all-time with the most Noble Phantasms. Archer betrays Rin and Shirou and joins Caster, yet Caster lets them walk away because Archer asked her too while ironically wielding a weapon called \u201cRule Breaker.\u201d Lancer defeats Archer and has the chance to kill him but doesn\u2019t because \u201cmy job is done.\u201d Lancer manages to rise and defend Rin not once but twice in the span of five minutes after presumed perished. And even near the end, the Holy Grail manages to appear next to Gilgamesh after already being destroyed.\\n\\n\r\nThat last paragraph is basically a list, but they are all examples of the same tactic: artificially prolonging events through \u201cconvenient inconveniences.\u201d There are even more not listed here \u2013 such as Kotomine having Lancer kill himself rather than Rin or Shinji given the opportunity to escape the burning mansion \u2013 that further demonstrate the narrative\u2019s unnatural feel.\\n\\n\r\nOne argument against all of these examples is that they have some kind of justification backing them. For instance, Lancer living after killing himself derives from his overall terrible luck (is it unlucky or lucky that he missed his heart?) or Gilgamesh being so perturbed by getting particles on his clothes comes from his arrogant personality (why not just fight them outside?). But they\u2019re often flimsy or weak; they generally require the audience to scratch his or her head and say \u201cI guess\u2026\u201d in response. In essence it comes down to tolerance, but Say Night 2 teeters too much on the edge between acceptance and absurdity to give everything a free pass.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this says nothing of the inordinate amount of exposition used during the fight scenes, the disregard for needed information on topics such as the \u201cCounter Force\u201d or \u201cGuardians,\u201d and the show\u2019s plot twists being lackluster in execution. Here again there\u2019s an argument, that usually takes the form of \u201cread the visual novel.\u201d That\u2019s great, and without a doubt gives a more fulfilling experience. But on its own, as a standalone anime, there is no excuse to make the narrative as bogged down or as broken as it is. One shouldn\u2019t have to read other material to receive a complete offering. It\u2019s like reading a book that has removed key words or paragraphs and asks you to reference a different book to fill in the missing pieces. It\u2019s not fair to the audience and it\u2019s not fair to the narrative, and the same applies to anime.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nDue to the length of the previous section, this one will be kept short and sweet. To put it simply, Stay Night 2 has some of the best visuals in the medium. The background art is vivid, gorgeous, and realistic in its presentation; character designs are crisp, detailed, and appropriate for each person\u2019s personality and demeanor; and actual animation is consistently high when it comes to duels, hair, facial expressions, explosions, running, and any other form of movement. The studio behind the venture, ufotable, demonstrates that, if anything, they can create beautiful shows that captivate the eye.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s pretty fascinating how much talking is done and dialogue that ensues which ultimately leads to nowhere with the majority of the cast members. Some of the worst that this second season has to offer are Illya, Caster, Caster\u2019s Master Souichirou, and Lancer. Lancer plays a prominent role in the festivities but next to nothing is learned about him besides the honor that he holds. Souichirou is similar; he came from a faraway place and, outside of a singular flashback, we come to know very little about him. Caster also follows this same trend. We see her devotion to \u201cfair\u201d magic and her adoration towards Souichirou, but the vain attempt to make her likable near her departure doesn\u2019t work because of her present behavior and how little there is given of her past. As for Illya, she is granted an entire episode dedicated to making her less crazy and more relevant \u2013 due to how much she had been sidelined after her initial outing way back in the first season \u2013 but her immediate removal makes her a second-thought.\\n\\n\r\nThere are more, like Saber and Gilgamesh, who receive just enough attention to not be completely useless characters, but unfortunately aren\u2019t given the resources needed to make them worthwhile. Even Archer fails, having the same, repetitive backstory replayed over and over in an attempt to make his plight rational. The best side character is actually the one who appears the least; Assassin\u2019s talk of meaning, and the most important thing being what\u2019s directly in front of us, is one of the most profound insights the show had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the worst character though is Shirou. It\u2019s hard to say what sort of impact the Holy Grail War had on him. He seemingly goes through a ton of introspection, wondering if the convictions he has are the ones not just right for him but those he himself personally believes in. In short, he doesn\u2019t develop but instead goes through a reconfirmation, having his ideals reinforced through both a physical and mental battle with himself. He doesn\u2019t change his stance, he isn\u2019t looking to follow a new creed, and he can\u2019t seem to shake his unending stubbornness. He stays nearly the same for the entirety of the season, remaining quite the static character despite the dynamic events he experienced.\\n\\n\r\nRin is, surprisingly, the best character the anime has to offer. At the minimum, the viewer does see a gradual shift in her outlook. In the beginning, the War was for her and her alone; she had no wishes and was simply there to prove the strength of her and her family\u2019s name. But in Stay Night 2, her gaze transitions away from this goal. Now, she focuses on saving Archer and protecting Shirou \u2013 essentially the same thing, but instead of being so selfish it becomes clear that she does have a wish she wants to see fulfilled. Her determination is evident throughout, where she concocts plans to fight their adversaries, she shares her mana with Shrirou in a deeply personal moment, and nearly dies upholding his beliefs. Simultaneously, we also witness her open up in terms of relationships. Again, rather than being so self-centered, she: forms a pact with Saber, forgives Shinji for his treatment of her, and even boasts the romantic connection she and Shirou share. She isn\u2019t a spectacular character by any means, but she does manage, by comparison, to be a diamond in the rough.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is mysterious, with the vocalist doing the majority of the work; raspy and calm, she carries the piece where it needs to go, from foreboding lows to hopeful highs. The beat itself is strangely slow, but it works to give the piece a sort of \u201ctugging\u201d feel that gradually fills you with adrenaline. The guitar, like the vocalist, also performs overtime, making the whole package pretty darn cool. The ending theme isn\u2019t sad, but nor is it happy. It\u2019s a strange mix of the two, with the singers and instruments unifying to create a steady song that has a lot of power but lacks the impact required to make it memorable.\\n\\n\r\nListening to the rest of the soundtrack is rather pleasant. Each track is extremely orchestral in composition, with choirs and instruments that make everything feel as epic as it should. It\u2019s also capable of going emotional when it wants to or even branching out to more techno-filled pieces. Perhaps even more impressive than the tracks are the sound effects. The sword clashes, foot plantings, and replications give the fights and situations greater appeal than they would without such detailed sound-work.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the anime is above average in all cases. A special shout-out is deserved for Ayako Kawasumi as Saber for her refined speaking and signature \u201cEx\u2026caliber!\u201d Kana Ueda as Rin for her girly yet determined voice earns one as well, as does Noriaki Sugiyama as Shirou for all of the screaming and intense lines he gave. Realistically, many cast members deserve recognition for continuing to reprise the same roles to give the (entire) series a certain sense of authenticity.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWith all of this being said, I still had a good amount of fun with the anime. Rin is one of the best \u201ctsundere\u201d characters in the medium, with her adorable moments shining brightly. Saber is one of my favorite characters from the series, so seeing her in action (at least, in the latter half) was awesome to watch. I like her more than Rin, but since this isn\u2019t Saber\u2019s tale, there was less of Saber than I would have liked to have seen. And the battles, when theywere in full swing, such as with Lancer versus Archer and Shirou versus Gilgamesh, made me laugh in awe by how incredible they were. Some fights though, like Gilgamesh versus Berserker, were underwhelming, which was strange considering how strong they normally always are.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works 2nd Season is an entertaining anime, without question. Its art and animation is top-notch, its music is powerful, and specific scenarios are a lot of fun. But with the massive amount of errors in its story and the majority of the cast being offensively bad, it ends up as a disappointing conclusion to a popular series. Hopefully when Heaven\u2019s Feel comes around it doesn\u2019t \u201ctrace\u201d this one.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, \u201cconvenient inconveniences\u201d ruin the narrative, justifications are flaky, and awkward exposition tarnishes anything it attempts to do\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, beautiful visuals, nice character designs, above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, the majority, from Illya to Shinichirou to Saber to even Shirou, are executed poorly, with only Rin and Assassin coming out on top\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, nice OP, okay ED, good soundtrack, nice sound effects, above average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, Rin is cute, Saber\u2019s appearances were entertaining, and some of the battles were fun but not much else was\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "After the first season of FSN:UBW I had high hopes that the second season would make up for at least some of the issues I had with season 1.  It turns out it did not in almost any way.  I am not a reader of the VN, but that doesn't change the fact that a series needs to work as a standalone piece without the aid of extra information provided by the source material to completely enjoy it.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story continues directly after season 1 (as one might assume) and the pace picks up considerably since season 1 had so much Shirou cookingand Rin whining to get through that it was like the Holy Grail War just hit the freakin' pause button for the majority of the season.  However, the quicker pace is not necessarily a good thing.  In fact, after the first couple of episodes there were so many character farewells that it was almost like, \"I can't WAIT to see what this character has in store for the series-... oh... they're dead now... after being in 2 episodes... hmm...\"  The pacing of this season was odd, to say the least, with important events being hurled at you one after another in one episode, then in the next episode nothing happens at all.  Some plot elements were left dreadfully vague as well, most often dealing with Archer's backstory and Shirou suddenly obtaining OP Servant-level abilities.  Because of this, the climax was poorly executed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is still top-notch for the most part, but with some flaws mostly dealing with mediocre CG integration for some backgrounds.  Fight scenes still look awesome (even if the outcomes of some fights make no sense).  The Opening theme in particular is more entertaining to watch than season 1.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nI may never hear an anime score as bland as this one ever again.  The only salvageable track is EMIYA which comes from the VN anyways, but the  original tracks are disappointingly dull.  Fight scenes sound like something that was rejected from Hans Zimmer's studio with enough fast percussion and BWAHs to make me feel like I was being incepted.  The insert song by Aimer was similarly bland and actually made me laugh when it showed up in an integral scene as it sucked out any of the drama or impact the scene possessed.  Besides that, the Japanese VAs do their job well.  I particularly like Archer's voice since it really suits him.  In regards to SFX, hearing the same sword clash sound for the thousandth time got a bit annoying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nI had hoped the second season would make up some lost ground on this front, but it failed to in quite a few ways.  First of all, many characters who deserved further development were killed off so quickly and pointlessly, that by the end, I forgot they were even a part of the show.  Some characters don't show up for 10-15 episodes just to be killed in a single episode as if they never mattered.  Shirou remains one of my least favorite anime protagonists.  The show does a poor job of explaining anything about his trace ability making it seem like he gains random powers out of nowhere that he can use to beat anyone/thing.  Not only that, but the big power-up he receives from Rin is one of the biggest Deus Ex Machina I've seen since he's pretty much unstoppable afterwards.  Shirou's personality is fittingly terrible as well since he wants to save everyone so much that he lacks any form of common sense.  While I get that that's kind of the point of his character, it doesn't make it any less frustrating when he somehow succeeds at everything.  Can he just die? Seriously.  How is he not dead?  Why did Gilgamesh go from being the strongest servant to being a complete joke of a character?  I think Lancer is the only character that I came out liking enough to consider my favorite.  He had admirable screen time and was a total badass.  I attribute the lack of good characters both to potentially poor adaption as well as flawed source material.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nThere were some episodes of FSN:UBW that I thought worked well and enjoyed watching while others were flat-out frustrating and left me weary of watching the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nI can only hope that the Heaven's Feel movie will provide a more interesting story with more interesting characters, a more interesting soundtrack, and a less buffoonish MC. \\n\r\n*avoiding spoilers*",

So where this anime falls short is the pacing of the entire show.\r\nThe pacing was excruciating slow each episode. It took a really long time for the characters to do something resulting in bad payoff each week of an episode. They should've cut some of that slice of life scenes as well as their investigation scenes and concentrated on various characters instead of following just those two main characters all the time. \r\nThis is why fate/zero was awesome, we got to know various characters storiesand motivations including their \"Heroes\" and we also got to see how they all reacted to each other and each others motivation. In fate/zero something always seem to happen each episode, resulting in good payoff. In fate/stay night we just concentrate on our main protagonists all the time and they aren't very interested themselves.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the payoff for this series felt lacking till the end. It felt as if nothing was happening for most of the entire series (until the end episodes).",

However, by season 2 I was already engrossed in this animation \u2014 one of the best of Spring 2015, although the English subs were somewhat difficult to comprehend at times. Shiro executed his role of Baka/OP MC flawlessly (another great line by him this season to watch out for: \"just because you're correct doesn't mean you're right\"), alongside strong female lead Tosaka Rin. I quite liked their somewhat unconventional romance mingled in with all the gory action. \r\nThe sound and visuals were breath taking \u2014 they reallyput a lot of effort into the aesthetics of it. One of the main reasons why this anime was pure epic is credited to the amount of money spent. It just goes to show that Unlimited Budget Works.",

Expect spoilers ahead.\r\nI\u2019m not a big fan of this cour (or season as MAL insists). It failed in everything it needed to do. The Caster arc was not really good since Caster was a plain villain. Ilya\u2019s death failed to make at least a little impact on the show (This is why Heaven\u2019s Feel exists). The characters in the show just come and go. Archer vs Shirou and his ideals produced episodes of tedious and repetitive dialogues. The dialogues are overwritten and awkward. Gilgamesh seemed tobe a decent final villain. Rin remains a generic tsunderin. The plot is decent enough but it\u2019s characters suffer.\\n\\n\r\nUfotable has done an exemplary job in its production. We have decent choreographed fights, godtier animation, detailed backgrounds. The VN soundtrack has it\u2019s cameo which I really really like. Aimer\u2019s Brave Shine and Last Stardust are great songs, Brave Shine captures the atmosphere of the show by Aimer\u2019s amazing vocals. Same with Last Stardust. Overall, the OSTs are godtier.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night is decent at best. It\u2019s not really bad, not necessarily good either. Mediocre plot and characters, godtier OST and animation. It\u2019s a shame actually, Nasuverse is one heck of a fictional universe, I really like Fate\u2019s worldbuilding but it have to suffer from Fate\u2019s story, Kara no Kyoukai is better than Fate. I\u2019m gonna rate this a 6. It\u2019s mediocre but it was pretty enjoyable to the least, and ufotable\u2019s production saved it. So it\u2019s passed\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6/10\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\r\nOverall - 6/10\\n",

            "content": "A review for both S1 and S2 with spoilers\r\nOnly having experienced Fate/Zero, I never encountered a Type-Moon written work before. But after watching UBW, I\u2019m truly appalled at how terrible Type-Moon\u2019s writing is.\r\nThe basis of UBW\u2019s plot is covered by its synopsis. In different wording, it\u2019s a grandiose battle royale-like duel between seven masters who each get a servant to fight for them. The goal is to kill every servant to attain the Holy Grail, which can grant a master and servant any fathomable wish. \r\nThis plot, even though basic on the surface, can become a masterpiece with proper execution, as seen in Fate/Zero withits large-scale fights, charismatic characters, and intriguing battles strategies. As the follow up to such an impressive series, UBW had a lot of weight on its shoulders to deliver the same grade, or possibly an even better, of quality. But unfortunately, not only did this series become a wreck within itself, but it also became one of the biggest disappoints that I\u2019ve ever experienced. \\n\\n\r\nBoth seasons of UBW suffer from the same pitfalls that include lacklustre characterisation, laughable battle strategies, and choppy protagonists. But the second season specifically has its own unique failures which I\u2019ll get to throughout the review. Let\u2019s get started:\\n\\n\r\nThe characterisation was one of the most noticeable falls of the show. The show virtually revolves around our protagonist two-teamed quartet Rin Tohsaka and her servant Archer, and Shirou Emiya and his servant Saber, while the other characters don\u2019t get the proper circumstances and/or screentime to become worth talking about. The show\u2019s first problem child is the \u201cintelligent\u201d Rin Tohsaka, who is the strategist on the protagonist side. Rather than intelligent, the word perseverant describes her more accurately. Many people say that she\u2019s smart, and while it\u2019s shown that she\u2019s book smart, she has no experience in applying it properly. Examples of these failures are shown in her \u201cstrategies\u201d that she comes up with. She's capable of generating multiple theories that appear profitable, but in the end all of her elaborate strategies amount to repeatedly showing up to a servant\u2019s base, provoking them until a battle breaks out, and ultimately losing in the end. On the off chance that she does manage to kill a servant, it\u2019s with an unexpected factor or the assistance of another servant. For example, after the oh-so-many attempts of trying to kill Caster, in the midst of yet another failure, the only way Caster was killed was by Archer - after his contractual separation from Rin - who launched an attack on her off-guard master, anticipating that she come in to protect him. The remainder of her victories are due to even more outside assistance that would otherwise leave her and her team dead.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have Saber, one of the main servants of the show and on the protagonists\u2019 team. Her gender bent character in Fate/Zero captured the eyes of many with her chivalric and powerful persona. But sadly, in UBW this strong personality was reduced to a slapstick tsundere and fanservice device. With erotic shots of her in BDSM-esque positions from her capture by Caster further corroding her character, it also gave the series an unintentional comical tone.\\n\\n\r\nAnd unfortunately, to finish off, we have Shirou: our dense protagonist that\u2019s plagued with a terribly-conflicting Samaritan complex; to such a degree where it makes it appear like his character is a parody of the average shounen protag due to how flat, irritating, and stupid his character is in the show. His boring dialogues with Rin and idiotic remarks aside, the most obnoxious part about Shirou was his philosophical stance towards the end of the season. The latter end of season two held a philosophical discussion with Archer and Shirou\u2019s battle about the pursuit of seemingly impossible ideals and its potential risks. The show took an interesting take on this by adding in an element that, in my opinion, serves as a device of self-reflection that further enhanced the potential of this discussion. Shirou faces the scorn of Archer who, as a future version of Shirou, is morally-crippled and dispirited as a result of the despair and anguish he faced due to Shirou\u2019s far-fetched altruistic ideal of saving everyone while ignoring himself in the process. Archer, trying desperately to convince Shirou to quit pursuing this seemingly impossible ideal to avoid the future tragedy that is himself, brings up several opposing points, including the most obvious one that shows how his ideals are contradictory: \u201cIt's true that you can probably achieve your wish to save others. But there's no hope of saving yourself in doing so.\u201d \\n\r\nAfter Archer\u2019s defeat in battle, Shirou fights Gilgamesh, who also adds onto Archer\u2019s scolding by telling Shirou that his philosophy is contrived and \u201cfake\u201d as a result of trying to become like his father, Kiritsugu, who he essentially copied his ideals from him. Shirou concedes to all of the points given by Archer and Gilgamesh, but somehow manages to come to some sort of epiphany and unexplainably validates his ideals and insist that they are \u201cright\u201d, even in the presence of the overwhelming evidence that blatantly showcases that, without a sense of realism, his ideals will remain damaging and chaotic. The point this discussion was trying to sell was that the pursuit of one\u2019s ideals and dreams is not in vain even with risks and failures up ahead. Where the discussion went sour was with Shirou\u2019s final justification of his ideals, which none of it rebutted the statements and examples of Archer and Gilgamesh. His justification can literally be summarised with his new infamous quote \u201cJust because you\u2019re correct doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWith my expectations so high for this series, it pains me to write such a scathing review. I truly wished for the best and tried to ignore the faults, but they became too large in number for me to continue to be blind to. With the fights and animation as the only two saving graces, I can say that in some moments, UBW was truly entertaining. But the journey overall was a boring and painfully bleak one with this show.",

            "content": "This review covers the Prologue, Season One and Season Two. My ratings are 6/10, 6/10 and 5/10 respectively. There are spoilers in this review.\r\nThe prologue/first few episodes of Unlimited Budget Works establishes the Fifth Holy Grail War; a battle royale between seven servants (made up of mythological figures such as Heracles) and mages where the last survivor is rewarded with being presented the Holy Grail which can grant them any wish they desire. During these episodes it is emphasized how dangerous this war is where even witnesses of the war will be murdered. Then in episode three the feeling of danger for our protagonists disappearsin an instant when Ilya decides to suddenly quit her battle with Rin and Shirou for no reason and go home. This doesn't get followed up on nor does it develop into anything. Perhaps my expectations were too high expecting fights to have an impact from the beginning, but these kinds of moments happen frequently. Some examples include; Archer's many chances to kill Shirou, Caster and Kuzuki not finishing off Shirou and Rin in episode ten and every fight where Gilgamesh is involved. \\n\\n\r\nWith the characters not taking fights seriously, another way to create tension in these fights is to emphasize the stakes of the Holy Grail War. To an extent, this works in UBW. The mages and servants eventually get eliminated, there are stories of innocent people disappearing or dying and the end game for Gil involves attempting to kill everyone. But these aren't executed well. The mages and servants would have their backstories explained in the episode they are about to be defeated, making it predictable. The innocent people's deaths are left in the background and their effects are never seen. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the end game, only a simplistic understanding can be gained from it due to the lack of explanation of the history, function and importance of the Holy Grail. All that's told by the show is that the Holy Grail may potentially be able to grant a wish of some kind, it can be used for evil, might not even require the war to be summoned and can be summoned by using a mage as a host. The Holy Grail itself appears as a pink blob. Most of these things get explained properly in other Nasuverse publications, however I believe that for a better viewer's experience they should have tried to address these problems in UBW. Nevertheless, they already have sequels planned so perhaps they will go into more depth then.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus of UBW is the emergence of Shirou as a mage. As a protagonist, Shirou comes off as a generic anime male teen with a naive mindset. He is a self proclaimed \"hero of justice\" because apparently everyone needs saving and only he can do it... by murdering people. If this show had a darker tone he would sound like a crazier version of Batman. Sadly though, the only exploration of his naive ideas and any other themes in UBW comes during his battle with Archer, which mostly involves repeating lines ad nauseam. There is also a forced romance thrown in to attempt to show Shirou's progression. He's not terrible as a character, but he's nothing special either.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters in UBW lack development. Some characters will be given short backstories before dying, but no characters show any real change. The closest are Saber and Shirou deciding that they're proud of themselves. Rin simply stays as a typical tsundere for the whole show. An argument could be made that there wasn't enough time given to character development. However, there would be more than enough time if the pacing was improved. For example, the character monologues during fights (Shirou vs Archer especially) could be edited down or episodes such as Winter Days, Faraway Home could be condensed into a few minutes. While I feel the phrase \"show, don't tell\" is overused, I believe it is appropriate in this case.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other issues and potential plotholes that could be nitpicked, such as Archer not having any knowledge of his earlier life, but I'd rather now look at the positives in UBW. The animation is incredibly fluid, especially during fight scenes. The incorporation of CGI feels natural and makes some scenes a real spectacle to watch. The sound effects are great and the voice acting is satisfactory. These technical aspects alone are enough to make UBW watchable. The soundtrack adds an extra level of enjoyment, especially the fan favourite OP Brave Shine by Aimer.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all the faults in UBW, the journey the characters go through is enjoyable enough to make this show satisfactory. Watching this won't be a special experience and other than the fight scenes, most of it will be forgettable. Nevertheless, unless you're a big fan of the Nasuverse, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to watch it.",

            "content": "The franchise of Type-Moon. Fate/Stay Night is a trademark for what the product has been with its key characters, premise, and setting. Fate Unlimited Blade Works is one of its major routes and returns for another season. A show about the Holy Grail sparkles into a pendulum of events and animated by the infamous Ufotable studio. Part 1 delivered what many fans wanted while part 2 attempts to do so yet again.\r\nWith the way the first half of Unlimited Blade Works was handled, part 2/Season 2 essentially sets up major events for the story. As for those who remembers, Saber is taken by Caster, Rinleaves after telling Shirou not to get involved in the Holy Grail War anymore, while Shirou wonders what awaits him next. The process of this buildup is quite thrilling as it sets up many potential events. Along the way, there are also other characters that becomes imperative to the ongoing storyline. A good amount of focus is Archer, Rin\u2019s former servant who apparently betrayed her. This season focuses a lot about his past, role, and purpose for what he is doing. As a show that\u2019s indulged by ideologies, it\u2019s interesting to see his arguments with others in particular Shirou. It defines their personalities and existence in this show not only but what they do but their reasons. From Shirou\u2019s viewpoint, his father Kiritsugu has inspired him to become a hero of justice. This becomes a central theme of Shirou\u2019s character as he tries to save the people he cares about. At the same time, there\u2019s some romance development between him and Rin. As clich\u00e9 it seems, it\u2019s not entirely surprising given the amount of hints the two have been throwing around. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, the series\u2019 main story still focuses on the Holy Grail War. Character building is important but at the same time, it allows the viewers to directly see their actions. While Illya isn\u2019t the most powerful servant in the show, she does make quite an impression against Shinji\u2019s servant, Gilgamesh. What comes around goes around and events that unfolds shows her devotion to Berserker. She even shows her genuine concern towards her maids. The show also does a decent job with characterizing her past including the Einzbern family. Do be warned that there will be some Fate/Zero spoilers involved. However, by this point, you should of watched Fate/Zero anyways. Later on, there are also some big reveals regarding Shirou and what his destiny may await him. It\u2019s what really makes the show thrilling as it anticipate what viewers awaits next. What is holding the show back though is some of the omitted content from the visual novel. From what I understand, it added filler material (or so some fans call it anime original) and extended dialogue that makes some scenes unnecessary longer.\\n\\n\r\nA strong point of this series is also the character relationships. At the center of it is Shirou who builds connections with others. In season 1, he build a prominent relationship of trust and respect with Saber. In the second part, he plays an important role alongside Rin. The first half of the series neglects Saber\u2019s prominence as the majority of the time, she is trapped by magic. And without a servant, Shirou is running around without a servant. He can only put trust in people such as Rin and at one point even admits that he has feelings for her. In essence, it shows how Shirou\u2019s role can have profound influence on others through his ideology. In the meantime, other characters such as Illya/Berserker, Shinji/Gilgamesh, Caster/Kazuki all gets their screen time of relationship connections. There\u2019s obviously some contrast between these especially with their climatic moments. But for what\u2019s worth, Fate Unlimited Blade Works can really make some impact when it shows the way these relationships are executed. \\n\\n\r\nAs the protagonist, Shirou\u2019s ideal and growth is a pivotal part of the show. This becomes a bit controversial at some stages as some people may not agree with him. Furthermore, these put into conflicts with others such as Archer and Gilgamesh. His idealism is similar to his former servant, Saber in many ways as well. Unfortunately, the show doesn\u2019t put much emphasis in Saber as much as part 1. It still gives her some time for development and evolves both her and Shirou, but just not them on a personal level or at least as much as Shirou and Rin. Similarly, Shirou\u2019s battle against Archer seems more like the apex of the show to me rather than the final fights. Here, we can see that Shirou is fighting for an ideal rather than just winning the grail/fight. On the other hand, Shirou\u2019s battle against Gilgamesh is stereotypical. Gilgamesh is a character that lacks strong characterization compared to the others although the show does flesh out his personality in full view. Egoistic, prideful, and arrogant are just a few words to describe him. But unlike some of the other servants, his relationships aren\u2019t so well developed. Just look at Shinji for an example and see where how he ended up. As the latter half of this season unfolds, we\u2019ll learn much more about each characters\u2019 reasoning for their choices. And Fate being a show that emphasizes a lot on this with lectures and metaphors, it\u2019s no surprise by this point. What I do have some issues with is the comedy and romance development. The comedy part seems like it has some improper timings. While it\u2019s not a core part of the season, I feel like they don\u2019t belong in this franchise at all except for some of the slice of life scenarios; mostly seen in season 1. The romance is also lacking. One of the episodes later on presents this in with a bit of symbolism. (yes I know what you are thinking, the infamous \u201cdolphins\u201d). However, what the fans got instead is a big question mark. On the contrary, the action bits of the show is a blockbuster hit. The climatic battles in the Unlimited Blade Works is a big part that was hyped from the buildup. Both times, Shirou shows his growth and what he has learned. Not to mention, he is a man that runs about his perspective ideologies so by some point, you\u2019ll even remember his lines.\\n\\n\r\nUfotable does it again. When it comes to artwork and visuals, the series shows why it\u2019s a powerhouse. Action is fairly solid especially in some of the more exciting fights. The Unlimited Blade Works is also highly decorative with the countless swords and symbolism. The backgrounds also has a mythic feeling to it when it matches its fantasy elements. My favorite parts would be the flower garden in one of the earlier episodes as well as the Unlimited Blade Works world. They really gave the word elegant a worthy meaning. Furthermore, we get a bit of violence to go along with all the action. Shinji, Illya, Caster are among some of these character that becomes a prime sample of this. On the other hand, the show isn\u2019t immune to censorship. Some of the more graphic content is censored by magical context while we get a rather obscure symbolism between Shirou/Rin\u2019s bonding. Hey, it\u2019s not like this was surprising though. Did you actually expect them to do it on screen?\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is a stronger point of the series. The OP and ED theme song has an eerie tune that matches with the coordination of its presentation. Shirou\u2019s battle theme is also emphasized to show how much he has grown throughout the season. Finally, voice mannerisms is uniquely dynamic for the most prominent characters in this season. In particular, I find Gilgamesh\u2019s narcissistic personality to be so matching with his voice. We can also feel the emotions that Saber expresses by her voice tone and Archer\u2019s revelation. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t say the overall soundtrack gets any better than that. In retrospect, it\u2019s a strong technical aspect of the season but doesn\u2019t exceed the expectations I got from part 1 either.\\n\\n\r\nSo how does Fate ultimately deliver? Well, for a show about magic, grail wars, and drama, it\u2019s certainly a chilling thriller that any Type-Moon fan should see. Director Takahiro Miura makes this story stand uniquely with its themes and style. And although some parts of the visual novel is omitted and replaced, it still ultimately lives up to its mature magic. That\u2019s because the real magic comes from the story and characters. For a talky show like this, it\u2019s often important to capture a viewers\u2019 interest before they are bored to death. Thankfully, on most parts, the show knows its strategies. It\u2019s also no surprise that the series continues to maintain its visual wonder. Suspenseful, thrilling, and crafted with emotional storytelling, the second season of Fate Unlimited Blade Works is a magical gift from Ufotable.",

            "content": "This review will be harsh, but second season of Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works fully deserved it. And don't be deceived by the catchy slogan \"Unlimited Budget Works\". The only thing which is truly unlimited in this anime is characters' redundant talking. \r\nSome of the show's weak points were unavoidable - the original material's storyline quality is dubious at times and the fact that Unlimited Blade Works as a second route of Visual Novel is supposed to be built up over experiences from the first one definitely doesn't help when someone is adapting it. But VN's weaknesses aside, its premise is interesting enough to makean entertaining show with lots of cool fights. And first season of UBW managed to do that fairly well. \\n\\n\r\nSecond season, on the other hand, does almost everything wrong. The animation is still gorgeous, but all the rest, oh girl. First of all - the creators seem to think that main strength of F/SN UBW is its story and, inevitably, character of Shirou. It's a massive problem, because Shirou is really not that great (which essentially means: he sucks). He wasn't that great in original VN, neither in F/SN 2006 and he still isn't in UBW. But now not because of his sexism or blandness but because his central conflict (which is the central conflict of the story now) is shamelessly moronic. What's much, much worse (moronic conflicts in action flicks aren't necessarily a bad thing) - the series abandons much of the action and characters' interactions in favor of explaining his utterly idiotic conflict to the viewer. Explaining again and again by two, three, four (I've lost count) episodes of pure talking. And by the end of this talking they still explained not very much - the viewer gets crazy amount of plot holes and plot conveniences instead. It's very clearly inherited from visual novel, but transfer of this style of exposition and this lazy writing into TV is inexcusable. The exact same problems haunt the interactions with and exposition of the main villain of the anime. Both these arcs are just plain bad - and because they happen to be the final ones they basically kill the show.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, as a result of putting emphasis on Shirou and his internal struggles, the show wastes other, much more interesting characters. Rin and especially Saber are sent off to backgrounds and play a role of damsels in distress. Rin in second part of the season continuously acts out of her supposed character. Saber on the other hand is literally doing nothing - which was explainable in the VN (she had her own route) but in the stand-alone anime it looks bizarre, to say the least. The anime even manages to botch the highlight part of its fictional universe - the moment Saber screams \"EXCALIBUR!!!\" isn't particularly memorable in this version. Which is really a shame. \\n\\n\r\nThe other part which seems to be forgotten by writers is the romance part of the original material and constitutes another example of character wasting - it started off quite well but it gets abandoned in favor of Shirou's struggles for many episodes. And then the series returns to it for a brief moment, in most convoluted sex-scene replacement I've had an honor to witness. This replacement is out of place, out of character and completely out of story's coherence. And honestly, if the series wasn't bad in the first place, its low score would be warranted on virtue of this scene alone - the very idea that, gasp, physical contact between characters (even in form of a kiss) is something which needs to be replaced in the show for teens is insulting and actively helps to make the world a worse place. The only thing which could be said in defense of the replacement is the fact that the actual sex-scene from VN was also insulting, out of character and degrading to women. But certainly it doesn't justify horridness of the replacement. Shame on you, ufotable.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the above maybe wouldn't be that annoying if only the action part of the second season was any good. It isn't. Most fights are static, anti-climactic and/or resolved too fast and constantly interrupted by excessive talking. I must also note uninspired choreography and lackluster design of some of the characters outfits. What's really weird - many earlier ones are actually not that bad, but in this anime the more important given fight is the more underwhelming it will be. Very peculiar and quite infuriating. The Gilgamesh's way of fighting is partially to blame for that, but still, zero imagination on the creators' side certainly doesn't help. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary: the series obscures the strengths of original novel (entertaining premise, cool servants, fascinating fights, good side-characters, romance), instead it emphasizes its weaknesses (main story, Shirou), amplifying it by ridiculous amounts of \"tell, don't show\". And as a bonus it damages the society by promoting petite bourgeois morality. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, this show is nothing more than a proof that world doesn't need any more Fate/Stay Night adaptations.",

            "content": "When news about this series was launched, I somewhat had mixed feelings; the original Fate/Stay Night was so horrible, I pity myself for watching it, while Fate/Zero was absolutely fantastic, plus Ufotable, responsible for Fate/Zero, were producing it.\r\nThat brings me to Fate/Stay Night UBW.\r\nIn short, I'd say that this series was absolutely stunning. I'm so glad it didn't turn out like the 2006 one.\r\nStory- 8\r\nGranted, the story was not as compelling as Fate/Zero. However, I was deeply surprised by the dark elements that were introduced. The 2006 one felt like a sad piece of shit, where viewers are supposed to feel sorry for Shiro throughout,for being the absolute dimwit he is. Rather than a hopeless romance that Stay Night (2006) was, UBW is more focused on progress and action sequences.  UBW might not have an extremely good story line, but it is fairly entertaining, without the presence of any loopholes.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10\\n\r\nOne word. Beautiful. Ufotable probably produces the most beautiful and amazingly stunning visuals I have ever seen to date. If Fate/Zero amazed me, this has managed to surpass even that in terms of animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 10\\n\r\nBoth opening soundtracks, especially Brave Shine, have found themselves cemented on my playlist. Sound effects, outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 7\\n\r\nIf this anime has even a small flaw, this might be it. Obviously, this was a HUGE step up from the 2006 version, but it did lack character depth. Characters like Kirei, Ilya and Saber could have added more to the show, and I would have preferred slightly more prominent roles (but then again, it might not have been that way in the visual novel). The apparent lack of a distinguished antagonist didn't help the cause. Kirei was the perfect antagonist in Fate/Zero, so I was expecting quite a lot from him in this as well (as this was supposed to be a direct sequel). Nevertheless, the annoying character of Tohsaka Rin has had a huge improvement, and she is pretty likable now. The most significant change I've seen in terms of character, is Shiro's. The hopelessly pathetic sorry piece of shit in Fate/Stay Night (2006) has turned out to be full badass in UBW; I hated him in the 2006 one, and was quite disappointed that he wasn't killed off by the end. However, his UBW character is the definition of a shounen anime/manga protagonist; it's as if his UBW character was finally provided with some balls, which the original clearly lacked.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 9\\n\r\nIt's one of the few anime I've really enjoyed in 2014-15. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9\\n\r\nGive it a watch if you're in for a ride.\\n\\n\r\n(P.S. Some of the subs don't make even the slightest of senses, so bear with it, or wait for it to be updated with better translations)",

            "content": "Ever since I first watched Fate/Stay Night anime, I got hooked. A lot of people were complaining how it didn't live up to their expectations especially the ones who played the Visual Novel before, but as someone who didn't, I quite enjoyed the anime a bit. Of course afterwards I immediately went to play the game, and I managed to only finish the Fate route for some reason. Then I went to explore a bit for other TYPE-MOON series and discovering Tsukihime and Kara no Kyoukai, which the latter is one of my all time favorite.\r\nNow for years people have been saying that Unlimited BladeWorks is the best TYPE-MOON story in the game, and how amazing it is and that it is levels above the Fate route. So of course, an anime adaptation at last of the best route should be pretty enetertaining - and it was.\\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade Works is about a boy named Shirou with a strong sense of justice, and selfless boy who rarely or almost never says no to anyone. He gets pulled into a sort of an age-old ritual, where the Holy Grail chooses Masters which in turn they summon servants, who are heroic spirits from the past (ex. Heracles, Gilgamesh, King Arthur etc.) to aid them in their quest. It is said that the Grail can grant the winner any wish he desires\\n\\n\r\nNow, the plot sounds very interesting - and it is, especially when in the series we get to see some famous and interesting characters from other tales we heard like Heracles and King Arthur. The series also has some high quality animation with flawless character designs, ways improved from the past adaptations. However, as far as the OST goes, I must say I prefered the version of the 2006 Fate/Stay Night adaptations, especially the opening \"Kirameku Namida wa Hoshi ni\", one of my favorite anime openings. I never skipped listening to it in Fate, while here I always skipped them.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Unlimited Blade Works is not without flaws. I felt like a lot of people expressed in their opinions that some episodes were very rushed, and it seemed like a lot of it was cutout. The fight scenes were very impressive, however the constant dialogue and flashbacks occuring ruined the intensity which resulted in being a little anti-climatic. The main character doesn't just suffer from the typical idealistic shounen character views as to \"save everyone without anyone getting hurt\", but also suffers from out of nowhere \"power-ups\" like how he could fight on equal footing with the Heroic Spirits and even defeat them, when he didn't really have that much time to properly train. I can see why many people would dislike Shirou also because other supporting characters are much more interesting than him, like Archer, Gilgamesh and Lancer (Lancer suddenly acting out of character and dying for Rin and all, what the hell was that about? It didn't give a proper explanation for his actions).\\n\\n\r\nHis idealistic views can be considered childish, especially in the world we live in today, with all the corruption, terrorism, crime and povery all over the world. The truth is you can't save everyone which is why a lot of people failed to symphatize with our main character. Rin also sometimes annoyed me with the over-used high-pitched voice tsundere archetype. However I must admit I admired how sometimes straight forward Shirou was with expressing his feelings for Rin and how she gets all flustered and embarrased, it was pretty funny.\\n\\n\r\nI felt a little backstory on some characters would have made the show more entertaining and we could have connected with the characters more. I would have liked to see some Gilgamesh, Lancer, Caster and Heracles backstory. Also Rider felt like it barely was part of the series. By the second season I completely forgot about her. \\n\\n\r\nStill, this was a pretty entertaining and fun ride. It had a lot of potential and great build up, but it ended up being anti-climatic and a little rushed, but the the ending was satisfying and a happy one. I admit I expected a lot more since as I said, for years I've been told that Unlimited Blade Works is the best damn thing TYPE-MOON came out with, but it was still good. The other Fate anime defiinitely had more memorable moments but every fan of the Fate series and TYPE-MOON has to watch this. Maybe it's time to resume playing the game for me and finish UBW and Heaven's feel route.",

            "content": "The Fate series holds a very special place in my heart, the escapades of Shirou Emiya and his servant Saber have enthralled me in a way that a lot of stories did not. From the romance in \"Fate\" to the climatic \"Heaven's Feel\", Fate/stay night hasn't just become one of my favorite stories, it's honestly become my favorite thing to come out of Japan.\r\nTo give you a bit of background as to where I stand with Fate, I have read the visual novel and its semi-sequel multiple times, I have seen and own the 2006 anime, the prequel Fate/Zero, and the 2010 film adaptation ofthis anime's route. So (not to toot my horn) but I think I have at least a fair understanding of the Fate universe, and from a fan's standpoint I can say without a doubt that this is an excellent adaptation of \"Unlimited Blade Works\".\\n\\n\r\nWhereas the 2006 anime adaptation was mostly based on the 1st route (entitled \"Fate\"), but added elements of the other 2 routes which turned it into a strange mix (and pissed off a good deal of fans), this adaptation sticks completely to the \"Unlimited Blade Works\" route while adding some anime original material to add more to the story. Now as the Fate series is based around the concept of the Holy Grail War, \"Unlimited Blade Works\" is probably the most war-less of the 3 routes, with the main conflict being a clash of ideologies rather than swords (although there is a fair bit of those as well). It is in this that the anime can be at its most exciting... or its most tedious as the anime is very dialogue heavy, and while I myself loved each conversation, not everyone will be as enthralled.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned above that I felt that this anime was an excellent adaptation of the source material, and I believe that to be true, however that's not to say that the source material itself is perfect. As much as I love the \"Unlimited Blade Works\" route, I cannot deny when there are flaws with the story, and there are a few. There are many instances where characters seem to be coated in layers of \"Plot Armor\", some story details don't make very much sense, and side-characters are thrown to the side just to be picked back up for relevance later on. That being said I do think the story presented here is very strong, having a tense beginning, plenty of twists and turns,and having what I believe to be one of the most satisfying conclusions to an anime that I've seen in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, the anime is populated with them, with the main focus being on our quartet. Saber is definitely the least developed out of the 4, as her story was the main focus of the 1st route, where she was also the love interest. That's not to say that she's a bad character here though, but her role is definitely toned down to being a nurturing friend. She conveys a very warm presence and is very welcome in the story. (There's also the fact that she may or may not be my favorite love interest of the franchise, and all anime in general.) Rin Tohsaka on the other hand is the main love interest, and as such gets the most screentime with our protagonist. She definitely has a very strong attitude and way of thinking, and has a lot of depth underneath what some would consider a tsundere personality. Her relationship with Shirou is also well done at points, but can be tedious if your not into teasing and excessive blushing.\\n\\n\r\nRin's servant Archer is the perfect definition of a badass, (You ever hear of the GAR meme? It came from him.) making short work of enemies with ease, with a smirk on his face. He could also be considered the deuteragonist of the series, with a good portion of the show being focused on his back story and overall mystery, adding a good layer of depth and being the focus of the show's most exciting conflicts. Then we have our protagonist, Shirou Emiya. The view of his character is very divisive within the anime community; some view him as an incredibly interesting character, others find him to be incredibly idiotic, I myself lean towards the former. Its hard to portray a character like Shirou in an adaptation as most of his character is shown through endless monologues in the visual novel, but putting that into an anime would grind the pacing to a halt. This results in a mixed bag from both anime watchers and visual novel players, but I personally found his character to be handled as good as it could for an anime adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nStudio Ufotable (the animators behind The Garden of Sinners and Fate/Zero) return to the Fate series and they return in style. The animation in this series is some of the best I've ever seen, with the entire series looking like 1 massive movie (leading to some to call this \"Unlimited Budget Works\"). The action sequences are absolutely jaw dropping, with characters zipping all over the screen with the jarring clashing of swords, its truly amazing stuff. It's not only the animation and the action that's great, the backgrounds are also stunning, with the art designers doing their best to create a photo-realistic representation of Japan, I'd get framed wallpapers of some of these backdrops.\\n\\n\r\nOn the music we have Hideyuki Fukasawa, composer of the other Type-Moon visual novel Witch on the Holy Night and the 2013 anime Flowers of Evil. Whereas most anime composers tend to create a few tracks and constantly replay them throughout a show, Fukasawa has decided to do something different : film scoring, having new music play throughout each episode. (That's 26 episodes filled with original music, 3 of which are an hour long. That's a lot of music.) His method is certainly ambitious, but how is his actual score? I found his score to be excellent, maintaining a consistent quality throughout the entire series. His action set-pieces filled me with adrenaline, his emotional moments moved me, and his renditions of of the classic visual novel music are just pure bliss.\\n\\n\r\nFate/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works] is not a perfect anime, nothing is. Some characters are flawed, story details don't make sense sometimes, and the pacing can feel really jumbled at some points. With that being said however, I've come to love this adaptation just as much, if not more than its visual novel counterpart. I came into this series expecting the core story of \"Unlimited Blade Works\" to be told in the anime format, and Ufotable has done that and so much more. I have enjoyed this series from beginning to end, not once feeling bored or let down throughout all of its 26 episodes. I cannot recommend this enough, why wouldn't I? It has become my favorite anime I've seen thus far after all.",

            "content": "\"Just because you're correct doesn't mean you're right!\"\r\nThe legendary words of Shirou Emiya have spread far and wide around the world ever since the 2006 adaptation of Fate/Stay Night with his infamous \"people die when they are killed\", and now our frustrating hero is back with more internal contradictions and bullshit ideals than ever. Through the course of Unlimited Blade Works one can watch Shirou go through the difficult process of realizing that his ideals are not only absurd but also simply borrowed from his father in a series of powerful scenes such as \"saying the same thing to Archer for two episodes,\" \"never talkingto Saber,\" \"flirting with full-on tsundere Rin\" and \"fighting all-powerful heroic spirits with some swords he made, somehow.\"\\n\\n\r\nNow I want to be clear about one thing upfront. Unlimited Blade Works was FUN. It was fun for nearly the entirety of its run. It's legendary to-die-for animation done by Ufotable, Lord of Action made sure that every single fight scene (of which there were plenty) was pretty much like getting an injection of cocaine. The story was rarely stagnant, always throwing itself onwards and upwards with more heroic spirits, more noble phantasms, and more right-before-death backstories. There were plenty of delightful cameos from all over the Fate universe, there were just enough scenes involving bro Lancer and SAO villain Shinji, and there was everyone's favorite Arthurian legend yelling \"EXCALYBIUUUUUU\" at just the right moments. For me this is definitely a show to be watched with friends, especially those who already have some background in Type Moon's elaborate universe, but that's not a requirement.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I can't say that I wasn't disappointed as well. As someone who came into the Type Moon universe through Fate/Zero, my expectations were fairly high. This was likely in part due to the fact that the writer for Fate/Zero was Gen Urobuchi, as the lending of his ideas and philosophies to the story made the inevitable monologuing between characters actually quite compelling. Basically, Fate/Zero was a fantasy epic: a fun, gorgeous, over-the-top battle royal marked by compelling characters arcs, sharp-enough writing, and a crescendoing conclusion that kept you on the edge of your seat and felt truly earned by the development that had been interwoven throughout the show, making full use of the show's slow start. It was fun, definitely, but is was also GOOD; it was akin to Game of Thrones for me and I loved it. When it was announced that Ufotable was adapting Unlimited Blade Works into a TV series of similar length, I was ecstatic. The epic could continue. Grown-up Rin and Sakura having to clean up after their fathers to try and stop the all-powerful Gilgamesh Reborn and his sociopathic sidekick Kotomine? Sounds AMAZING. I already found all of those characters compelling, I couldn't wait to see what kind of creative development had occurred during the time skip, and I was practically drooling for more Gilgamesh. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I got instead was pretty much a wall of orgasmic fight animation and a plethora of awesome one liners. And not much else. \\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade Work's most fatal shortcoming is without a doubt the lack of a strong supporting cast. In contrast to Zero where characters were like to discuss their philosophies and ambitions while facing off, in Blade Works they usually just talk about their power levels and abilities and how much they are going to win. Because of this we don't really get much of an insight into the minds of very many heroes and masters, and that leaves us feeling less like we're watching the battle royal that the Grail War is in which many different sides compete for different reasons for their own all-important causes, and instead watching \"the adventures of Shirou, Rin, and Saber when she talks occasionally.\" Usually the only time in which the other masters and their spirits get development is through flashbacks that show us little about who they are now, just who they were, and often take place right before their deaths as if they are shoehorned in there just to make us care at the moment we're supposed to. That's not how it works: you can't make me care about a character by killing them, you have to make me care enough about them before anything happens to them that I don't want them to die in the first place. There's no tact to the way that the story unfolds: it's pretty much broken up into chunks in which the protagonists deal with struggles of increasing difficulty, and the other characters pretty much wait their turn until it is time for them to appear and have their chunk of time, forcing all of their development into this conveniently blocked-out area. That's not how good storytelling works: you have to weave these strands together from the beginning, slowly building the characters and the nature of their struggles until these arcs begin to culminate. Unlimited Blade Works does not do this, and when the second half comes and it starts pulling off its big moments, they aren't really all that big because they rely on elements that are essentially introduced on the spot. We aren't watching the satisfying culmination of previously set-up story elements, we're watching what in another show might be an outstanding scene if it had and prior weight to back it.\\n\\n\r\nWith the lack of a strong supporting cast, the burden of the story falls almost entirely to our screen-hogging duo, Rin and Shirou, and their heroic spirits Archer and Saber. Saber's been around before, and her story is FASCINATING: last time, we left off with her realizing that it was her own martyrdom that made her fail as a leader, then she was forced to destroy her one piece of hope to change that and sent back to the waiting place to despair over her failure. Now she's back, and all i want to see is how she's changed, how she's going to express those changes, what kind of path she's decided to take now, etc. But do we get any of that? Ever? Not in Unlimited Blade Works at least: Saber is pretty much a side show and a fighting tool, throwing around her epic city-leveling noble phantasm when necessary and besides that just quietly telling Shirou that she'll protect him and eating his sandwiches in silence. Rin takes her place as a female lead, doing everything she can to keep the audience emotionally invested, and at first she does a pretty good job: the hour-long prologue is amazingly good, especially for her character, and at first her drive in the Grail War and her distant yet not completely uncaring relationship with Shirou are the makings of a strong lead and potentially tragic adversary. However, it's not a particularly long period of time before the entirely of Rin's character can be summed up in two lines:\\n\r\n       - Knows useful things about magic\\n\r\n       - Is a tsundere\\n\r\nIt's tragic, really, and while her character never really makes the story drag she doesn't really do much to make it compelling either. By the end she's mostly defined by Shirou, talking almost exclusively about his struggles and internal contradictions, blushing aggressively at times and telling him how to use magic the other times. I feel like the show almost forgot about her own extremely passionate desire to uphold her father's name and avenge his death, and she seemed to have most of her complexity sucked out of her.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to Shirou & Archer. I don't want to go to far into them for the sake of avoiding spoilers, but the show is essentially their story at this point, and as such it backs itself into a corner where they pretty much make it or break it. On the one hand, they make it: the ideas behind their characters and the philosophies that they espouse are fascinating, and the basis for both of them could be taken great places and no doubt was in the visual novel. However, they are undermined by a single factor: the writing in the show is appallingly bad. It's contrived, insultingly repetitive, watered-down and lacking in virtually any substance. This isn't helped by the fact that the story is disjointed and poorly-organized. Combined, these shortcomings inflict irreparable damage both to these two characters and to the show as a whole, and now we're back to the beginning:\\n\\n\r\nThe show is fun to watch. That's about it. It has phenomenal animation, plenty of hilariously cheesy lines, a beautiful soundtrack including a second opening that will never get out of your head (Brave SHINNEE!!), scenes that should be too stupid to exist, and have I mentioned the art yet? However, unlike Zero, it is no longer seriously compelling, it no longer earns emotional engagement, and it loses much of the epic feeling of the story through lack of proper buildup and insane excuses for writing. This would have been more bearable if it wasn't supposedly a sequel to one of the greatest fantasy epics of our time: this was like watching the Phantom Menace or the Hobbit movies and watching characters that I loved and cared about get tossed around by some insane director until they were reduced to poorly-written shadows of their former selves. On it's own, it's a blast, but as a sequel to Zero it's a disappointment. This is in no way an attack on the source material: the story that was trying to be told seemed to be one of merit, but it was slaughtered ONCE AGAIN (Fate/StayNight cannot catch a break) by appalling execution. The budget might be higher than Japan's GDP this time, the voice acting may be superb, the music hype (apparently several songs from the visual novels were pulled and used in the show) but the pacing and arrangement of the story combined with the terrible writing (as well as a few scenes that were just straight-up adapted awfully) made Unlimited Budget Works into a bit of a letdown and an unworthy successor of Fate/Zero. \\n\\n\r\nIf this is your introduction into the Type/Moon universe, you probably couldn't pick a better place to start. This show is incredibly fun by itself, and when you've finished it everything else you watch will exceed your expectations (except the 2006 Fate/StayNight) whether it be the mighty prequel or the acclaimed Garden of Sinners or the soon-to-be Heaven's Feel and Hollow Ataraxia. However, if you liked or loved Zero for any of the reasons I did and you've been waiting until this show finishes to decide whether to watch it or not, I must unfortunately advise you to stay away from it. The closure it provides for Zero isn't good enough to warrant tainting the characters/story. You're better off with the strong yet open ending of Zero. Watch Garden of Sinners instead, or wait for Heaven's Feel and hope that they get a different writer and director.",

            "content": "The first cour had a great progress. However, it declined a bit this second cour.\r\nWe had more action and character development. Giving focus mainly on the clash between Shirou and Archer. The animation in general was very good, just gave a fallen light in some scenes, but nothing too serious. In this adaptation of Fate managed to convey very well what the Visual novel wanted to spend. It was not a 100% faithful adaptation (maybe 90% faithful ), but unlike the previous studio, that enriched the story, adding more detail and develop harmoniously. We have seen some situations from the perspectives of other characters likeas Illya, Saber and Caster.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I loved in this adaptation was the constant use of symbolism to represent the feelings and suffering of the characters. I also really enjoyed the monologues placed in the anime, especially in flashbacks of Archer.\\n\\n\r\nMy complaints with the anime are relative to some anti-climatic cuts, which in some episodes totally broke the climate of the previous episode (or previous scene). A serious error direction.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I did not like, was again forgetting some important explanations, which have not been placed, left the anime with some information missing. Not are things so serious, but would have left the anime with a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several opinions about the protagonist. I can not hate him ... he just follows what he believe is right, however this is wrong. He does not care about the opinions of others, and has no regrets what he does. This can be seen by many peoples as something stupid, but in my viewpoint, I just see someone following and believing what think it's correct, hypocritical or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime ended in a very pleasant way, with an epilogue going on two years after the war and showing a bit of life of the protagonists after that. We had a surprise appearance of a character who was present during the Fate/Zero events.\\n\\n\r\nAs a general, the anime was not something completely spectacular, but just something good which provided striking scenes and interesting characters. 8/10\\n\\n",

Some moments did seize the opportunity to surprise out of nowhere and that was the beauty of season two unlike season one there was the element of surprise that you sort of expected in a way (I know what the heck does that mean) but if you watched season one which you must of if your reading this review, there are moments that will surprise out of nowhere so be prepared. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all this anime lives up to be a good season two or squeal (if that floats your boat) for anime that has a rich history of being a top notch animation technique accompanied by actionful ( made up word of the week ) scene covered in frosting of drama and feels but is  good enough to live up to the legend of season two good enough to watch rather than reading or watching the summery.\\n\\n\r\nSo Enjoy and adi\u00f3s.",

            "content": "This Review applies to both seasons of Unlimited Blade Works. The Video review is up on my channel, but here is the written.\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nIf you\u2019re familiar with the Fate series, its pretty much is the same. But in Unlimited Blade Works it follows a different scenario. Sure the beginning is pretty much the same as it was in Fate/Stay Night, but the focus is much different. But to put you up to speed, 7 masters and heroic servants fight in the war to gain the ultimate wish fulfilling device known as the Holy Grail. The story this time around focuses a lot more onShirou, Rin and the mystery on her servant Archer. We never really got to know Archer all that well in the original Fate/Stay Night, but in Unlimited Blade Works, we see the trials and tribulations he had to go through to become a servant and when we learn where he comes from, we question if whatever he was doing was right or wrong, and we also see if it can be fixed.\\n\\n\r\nIn my personal opinion, I prefer the Unlimited Blade Works path over the Fate/Stay Night path. The story felt more believable and the relationships between the characters felt more natural and not as forced. The story does however have pacing issues, as for some parts it does drag and there a some moments that felt unneeded. It does have a slow start, especially if you start from episode 0 then watch episode 1 as they are 40 minute episodes also they\u2019re the exact same except, told through different perspectives. And it does suffer from the usual problem of a Fate series, if you\u2019re not familiar with the world, it\u2019s hard to follow and understand. However I must say, if you never watched the original Fate/Stay Night, before it\u2019s definitely ok to watch this adaptation, but it\u2019s sort of also made for those who watched Fate/Zero. The story is much more thought out in Unlimited Blade Works, and the writing is more consistent as the character interactions with each other, makes more sense than it did in the original.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nShirou Emiya returns as the main protagonist for Unlimited Blade Works. What I like about his character in this adaptation is that his is actually not an idiot. Shirou is actually more competent in this adaptation than the original, he respects those around him and acknowledges their powers and he also a better learner in magic, which makes him more formidable in battle, compared to his dumb luck in the original. Shirou does however still retain his sense of justice, as he believes what he is doing is right, despite what is shown around him, yet he continues forward with his views. He just wants to be a Hero of Justice, and save as many people as he can. \\n\\n\r\nSaber returns, but rather than a main role she has more of supporting role this time around. And personality is a bit different than the original. For instance she is more cool and calm than before but also more cooperative. She has a more chilled personality than the serious Saber, don\u2019t get me wrong she still goes serious in fights, but outside of that she has a more approachable personality, and she so adorable in this adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nRin Tohsaka take the role as main female protagonist. Rin serves more a purpose in this adaptation as she trains and gives Shirou the ins and outs of the Holy Grail War. She does in this adaptation, show more interest in him, and you can see this further down the track and the reason for it. She is a competent mage, showing high level of strategy in different situations despite the odds. And her relationship with Shirou felt much more natural, rather than forced. I like how in this adaptation she is given more purpose, but also better explained behind her motivations.\\n\\n\r\nThe true star of this adaptation is Archer. Archer\u2019s backstory is delved into much more detail. His origin story is probably the biggest twist in the series and you\u2019re just so sucked in by his misfortunes and you feel sorry for the guy. He fights for his beliefs despite if it\u2019s wrong, but is correct. At the same time he\u2019s still a badass and probably gets the most time to shine in action scenes. Archer plays more of an anti-hero in this adaptation and his interactions with Shirou gets really interesting later on, as we see why he has an interest in Shirou.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course I want to talk about my personal favourite servant, Gilgamesh who returns with a bigger role than original Fate. Gilgamesh is given more of the overall antagonist of this adaptation. And he\u2019s still as arrogant and badass as ever. The only thing about him in this adaptation, is that we don\u2019t see him in his armour. Despite this retains his arrogant high chair personality all the way to the end, which I why I love him as a villain.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all these great characters, some other characters this time around didn\u2019t get as much screen time as they did in the original. Some characters felt very pointless, because they hardly made an appearance at all and some backstory\u2019s were definitely left out to make way for our mains. But some characters also did get more time to shine than they did in the original. Some characters I was rather surprise, at first I didn\u2019t care for Caster, but after seeing her backstory, I felt a bit sorry for her, same for Ilya especially after I found out what happened to her. The characters this time did touch more heart a bit, but some of the development and lead ups to was very slow. The main, despite being developed quite well apart from Saber, who pretty much wasn\u2019t developed that much at all, it was kind of slow and of course it\u2019s going to be slow, because it\u2019s 26 episodes long, including episode 0.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 10/10, 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you have been hearing of this show being called Unlimited Budget Works, you are not wrong, it is literally unlimited budget works. The animation is dropped dead gorgeous, the special effects look amazing the particles look incredible as well. The action scenes are probably the best animated sequences I have seen in anime, the fights are well choreographed to go with it as well. No scene is dropped with quality, everything runs very smoothly from frame to frame. The characters designs look much better than original as they look more realistic, they don\u2019t have a huge upper body like the original, but more even out. So much thought has been put into each action sequences, as they don\u2019t really repeat any animations at all and you especially see this when they\u2019re fighting in Archer\u2019s noble phantasm and Gilgamesh, when you see a lot of different designed weapons. The animation and art is amazing, when I saw Fate/Zero I wondered how are they going to top the animation, and Ufotable has pulled off something amazing in Unlimited Blade Works. It really felt like their budget is unlimited, they pretty gave everything detail even if it\u2019s the littlest of things.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is as enjoyable. It\u2019s still does a great job of complimenting the anime, there some very nice orchestral music to complement each scenario plus there is the added touch of electro here and there. However the soundtrack compared to Fate/Zero doesn\u2019t have the epic feel towards it, there is really not that much epic choir to go with the music. Which could\u2019ve made some scenes better, it was good, it just wasn\u2019t epic. The opening themes are good, they do their jobs, the animation for it however is great, just like the whole show. Same things can be said for the ending, they do their jobs and a good, but not really as memorable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWatching Unlimited Blade Work did feel like re-watching the original Fate, so some episodes, I was like oh my god, I\u2019m watching it over again, except the animation is better. I did enjoy the show a lot more than original fate, as I preferred this path over that. The relationship between characters made more sense and I like the character interactions more than the original. The most enjoyment I got in this show was watching the gorgeous visuals and action scenes. Whenever I was watching Unlimited Blade Works, I did not want to watch another anime, in knowing this is probably the best animated series to date. The action scenes are very cool and the fact that the story focuses on characters I was more interested in made it a huge plus. The only thing that sort of disappointed me was that some characters were given less to work with this time around, and it\u2019s a shame because I think all the characters deserve to shine.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the story of Unlimited Blade Works, I give it and an 8, as the backstory behind Archer was really interesting the theme behind doing what\u2019s right was really motivating as well. The writing made more sense this time around and it was good story. The story does suffer from the usual Fate problems, with an uneven pacing and hard to read concept.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound I give it a 10 and 7. The animation is amazing to look at, it really highlights what ufotable can do. The world looks amazing to the smallest detail. Each action scene is gorgeous to look at from the dust particles to the specials effects and the choreograph fights are amazing as well. However the sound, despite being a good soundtrack really lacked the epicness that we got from Fate/Zero, but unfortunately I didn\u2019t find the opening and ending themes as memorable.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters I give it an 8, the characters were much improved from the original. Shirou was more competent. But it\u2019s the interaction between the characters that really shined, Shirou and Rin\u2019s interaction felt more natural, and same with Saber. Archer had a very interesting past, which is pretty much the focus of the show.  A lot of characters got to shine, but then again, a lot of characters didn\u2019t, which is unfortunate because I loved some of these characters whether it was from Fate/Zero or Fate/Stay Night (2006). \\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment I have to give it a 8. Because I did enjoy it more than the original, but at times it just felt like I was re-watching the whole series again, since I have an idea of what\u2019s to come. The action scenes are amazing to look at, but there were a few problems in the story pacing you just want to end so you can watch the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAfter rounding it all up, I give Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works an 8/10. The animation is amazing great, however they could\u2019ve added more to their presentation, because the soundtrack was not as memorable. The story is improved and the character interactions are better as well. I recommended Unlimited Blade Works to an fans of the Fate Series, but also especially recommend it to action fans, as the animation for the fight scenes are gorgeous, you\u2019re just going to get caught up in the world. \\n",

            "content": "Warning: Partial spoilers for Epilogue\r\nI gotta say I love the sunset fading to night scene leading to the ending credits. It makes the viewer actually feel like they are experiencing that world in real time alongside those characters. Something about it was too beautiful to put into words. Guess you could say it's a perfect way to end a thought provoking epilogue that makes you think twice about dropping out of school. Right before, Rin was saying there is so much in the world that is worth suffering for and experiencing, so it was worth dropping their things and taking a risk going off thenormal path. It takes the point home when you see the view from a small dorm room to the city landscape. And of course the night sky which is limitless and transcends every era of time like Saber's. I don't know if anyone noticed this yet: In the end, I think it is very likely they were trying to give weight to the title. Rin talks about their fate and staying together, which is followed by the night sky. Fate/Stay Night. Voila!\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I felt the second cour was mediocre as an adaption. I could tell the epilogue would have complimented a good adaptation very well, but it feels slightly out of line because it feels deeper than the previous episodes, which had no substance and lack of characterization. The conversation/monologues they had at Saber's grave site and just Shirou talking to himself is a great example of what the series was seriously lacking for VN viewers. There was really no good reason to leave those things out when they have so much time to fill with anime original scenes and this epilogue which is basically all original. So the ending feels less impactful than what was probably intended. I'd call this adaptation a tragedy because it was a wasted opportunity which took a decade to become a reality. Heaven's Feel next, which will have a lot less hype now because UfoUBW technically dropped the ball.",

            "content": "*spoilers down below for the review of this series*\r\nHere's going to be my Fate/stay Night Unlimited Blade Works anime review as a whole. Now before anyone goes and attacks me, just because either of my rating score or my review, keep in mind what I will say first. The series is pretty much debatable, people can like it, people can despise it. There's an amount of people that goes and tries to debate on the show, me personally, as a person who likes this series, I won't take the show as a masterpiece, because it's not even a 10/10. And if there are people fromthe Fate/Zero franchise that goes and attacks me as well, keep in mind in here as well what I have to say. I do not like Fate/Zero at the end of the day, but it does not mean that its a bad series. The reason why I prefer UBW in terms of conclusion is because for me it actually had at least a satisfying ending. I know, Fate/Zero ending was incomplete, but that was before I even knew there were other routes. And I still feel like I didn't like Fate/Zero. But the same score went for F/Z and F/SN UBW as a whole series completely. \\n\\n\r\nPlease keep that in mind that this is just one person's opinion, nothing too groundbreaking that could be considered a disease but neither to the point of fangirling towards the point I call a series a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a sequel to Fate/Zero, Fate/stay Night Unlimited Blade Works brings the continuation but rather with a different protagonist, Emiya Shirou, who then became the new master of Saber since it was passed 10 years. As the time passed by, we get to see some bits of things going on around the series. The first half of the show was alright but its just because I couldn't see the character development of the main protagonist. We see Shirou following the ideal that he grasped but doesn't take the consideration in the first half that what he would be causing is pain to himself. The second half of the series was more fleshed out in his character, as I look at the both perspective point of view of the same Ideal between Archer and Shirou. Archer its one of the characters that had the same ideal, but as the time passed, he slowly started to regret taking this specific ideal. For Emiya Shirou on the other hand, he takes this ideal as a beautiful thing because he wants to save innocent lives. The story progressed smoothly and gives us some things to understand this conflict. In the end of the day the ending of the show can be interpreted as one of the worst endings, or one of the most satisfying endings. But how can I call this anime series ending? Well in short, from what I can see Shirou will continue to follow the same ideal, but, he will never become like Archer (terms of guardian). So in the end he decided to take a different direction while keeping the ideal he got.\\n\\n\r\nMy only issue with the story is that for me some of the exposition or the info dumping may ticked me off. But then again this isn't the greatest story ever. But it kept what it needed to be.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAs stated the characters would be a weaker part of the series just because they don't get well developed, but if I think about it in a perspective, then the characters were already developed in Fate/Zero. I don't have any type of issue, but that's just me though. My issue with the show is because they give so little screentime for these characters in this series, that sometimes snaps me out. But regardless there are characters that got developed. \\n\\n\r\nEmiya Shirou developed as a character, which is the strongest center part. He learns from his ideal and his consequences, and decided to then take another path though he continues to follow the ideal.\\n\\n\r\nIllya got developed in the show as well, but the issue was the same as stated in the first paragraph. She was given little time to become around that it ticked me off.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that I still like the characters, even though some didn't fleshed out so much in this whole series, I guess you can say its department is decent in a sense.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nHere are the good parts of the series which most people would agree with me for the most part. The art and animation was made by Ufotable, the same studio behind shows such as the Kara no Kyoukai movies and Fate/Zero, which this doesn't let me down. They have the \"Unlimited Budget Works\" throughout the whole anime series. I really like how they use the color pallet of the series, and especially with the effects of the weapons, the CGI looks very nice and also when it comes to battles, especially with Gilgamesh, they give impressive angles in the whole anime series. This is the strongest part of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music department is rather very solid and show fitting, which for me the OST fits very well with the series. From heart warming to tension rising, even fighting OSTs. They use the instrumental approach, which is very nice from them to use.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBesides those little flaws, I simply enjoyed a lot on UBW. This is a manner of preferences but I think the enjoyment factor on the series is very much what I didn't thought it had. Entertaining fights, marvelous animation, the amazing soundtrack, and such ends.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.8/10 (Round to an 8)\\n\\n\r\nFor me personally, Unlimited Blade Works got the flaws, and I can't deny that. But it was simply one enjoyable experience. As stated this is an opinion regarding on my thoughts. So if you disagree I'm fine with that. \\n\\n",

            "content": "For visual novel readers and anime-only watchers alike, the attraction of the Ufotable-Type Moon pair-up is obvious.  Nasu's highly intricate and appealing designs brought to life by Ufotable, who are excellent in visuals and art.  This partnership works to great extent but was unfortunately lacking in the other important components such as character development, relatability and execution of the story that are needed to create a compelling narrative.\r\nThe problems have mostly to do with the conversion from one medium to another.  Visual novels thrive on details, through the use of monologue while anime simply thrives on visual gimmicks.  In essence, readingVNs require a very long attention span, while anime caters to those who want instant visual stimulation.  Going straight to the point, anime as a medium is appealing to those with shorter attention spans.  Converting a details-heavy story into an anime therefore has its problems and UBW is yet another adaptation which falls into this trap.\\n\\n\r\nIt is no surprise that the anime felt hollow, especially in the second season.  The anime misses out a lot of highly important dialogue that fleshes out emotions meaning we never got to fully understand the characters.  Servants and masters with their own deep thoughts and motives simply became cannonfodder in the anime.  What was a carefully crafted setup to a fight simply became \"Boom!  Explosions!  Blood!  Dead!\".  While the anime keeps the very barebones of the story intact, the lack of detail really removes any chance of forming connections with characters.  This also reduces the \"shock value\" when a certain character gets killed off.  In the end the anime becomes a \"sit down, watch explosions, the end\" experience.\\n\\n\r\nExcept it even fails on that regard.  There are long moments in the middle of battles where the characters simply stand up and recite lines from the VN.  Details is good, no?  Except that it fails to satisfy neither VN or anime medium fans.  The dialogue is too shallow and brief for VN fans while anime-watchers are treated with info-dumps which exceed their attention spans, and their craving for explosions go unsatisfied.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the amazing story that is UBW can only be told in one medium.  The VN medium, as animation as a medium is incapable of telling a deep narrative, nor do their fandom want it.  This makes the VN and VN fandom objectively superior to anime and anime fandom.  For those distinguished people who want a complete experience, please go read the VN, for it is far deeper than any anime out there which thrives on the gimmicks of explosions, moe and fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nSome say VNs are too hipster, but hipster anime also exist.  The Aria the Animation franchise is highly popular and acclaimed by hipsters.  However, this should never be watched or supported for it really is only fanservice, with unrealistically proportioned hips and costumes to suit those with a leg fetish.  The hipster of anime comes nowhere near close to the hipster of all VNs; Asairo and Subarashiki Hibi.  Now, this is a true masterpiece in narrative and execution that no anime comes close to, and will never come close to in the future.",

            "content": "I don't get it, guys. I don't.\r\nWhy Unlimited Blade Works? Why this underwhelming, anticlimactic excuse for a spluttering car crash of a visual novel route? Did ufotable have to faithfully adapt every wheel-spinning two hour conversation in which Pollyanna protagonist Shirou is repeatedly called a dweeb for his goofy idealism? Did they have to make sure we were reminded what a complete loser Archer is every time he appears, legs spread like his balls are prickly pears, perched on some conveniently placed rubble? What is actually appealing about Archer when his only major personal distinction from fellow Fate/stay night snarkster Lancer is his adolescent moralnihilism? What is there to admire about a character who is so unimaginative that his inner world is literally a wasteland full of imitation swords? Why do people like Archer?\\n\\n\r\nWhy did ufotable pick the route where the mid-boss is Caster and the teacher with the upside-down glasses? How did they fail so hard at making a pair of cynical murderers interesting? Why include a half-hearted tribute episode to the tragic homunculus Illya in the route where Illya and her Servant, Berserker, are a mere afterthought, as though ufotable realised that she deserved more attention than Caster ever did? Why couldn't we just have had the Berserker vs. Saber fight like in the Fate route? Why couldn't they at least have spared a thought for the narrative arc of poor neglected Saber, left to wilt after the misery she withstood in Fate/zero? Why did every free second of this show have to be filled with endless identical monologues about youthful idealism?\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, what is even the point of adapting a route where breakout character and franchise cash-cow Saber is fully relegated to the background throughout and possesses barely any agency of her own? Why did they retain the awful premature ejaculation of an ending, in which school rapist Shinji turns into the Smooze and Shirou has the worst fight ever with the supposed King of Heroes, Gilgamesh, who can't even be bothered to change out of his chavvy streetclothes? What kind of action anime peaks with two angry men yelling repetitive dialogue at each other while swords fly everywhere? Why is Saber's only half-decent action scene a stilted sword battle with a literal fake Servant whose entire shtick adds up to a convoluted version of the air conditioner's dilemma in The Brave Little Toaster (I was designed to stick in a temple! I like being stuck in this stupid temple!)?\\n\\n\r\nWhy was the last episode an OVA set in a twee version of London? Why is this new environment merely used to stage an oh-shucks cameo from Luvia and an extended moment of incredulous Jaden Smith-esque brain-death from Shirou as he spews all over Saber's dimly remembered non-heroics by wondering how it could be that history is real if English people aren't real?\\n\\n\r\nWhy do people like Unlimited Blade Works? How was this better than the Studio DEEN anime besides its production values? Is it really any less slow and repetitive? What is there to like about Shirou's stupid, abortive psychodrama? Is it just Rin? Is that it? If so, how can you account for the horrible, horrible reality that this route isn't even about Rin so much as it is about Shirou literally talking to himself for hours and hours only to come to the same conclusion with which he began? Is she really worth it, guys? Is it really worth *this*? Really?\\n\\n\r\nI hope you're all happy, Tohsaka fans. Go cross-dress in some thigh-highs and hate yourselves, you failures. Roll on Heaven's Feel.\\n\\n\r\nClarification edit: UBW does work well in the context of the VN, but holy holy it was a bad idea to adapt it straight.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nEveryone has their own set of convictions. Whether they are religiously, politically, or morally based, there are certain creeds that we, as individuals, follow. Depending on the ideals we hold, our very person is shaped, directing the lives we lead and the paths that we take. For me, I uphold a simple one: \u201ca little kindness goes a long way.\u201d So I try to do just that. I hold the door for others, give my thanks whenever I can, and call my family to check up on them. Small stuff, and probably pretty common too, butsuch actions have nonetheless made me into the kind of man that I am today, and hopefully who I\u2019ll be in the future. Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works 2nd season hones in on the convictions we maintain, but it never escapes its own faults to make its beliefs worth listening to.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nStay Night 2 follows immediately where the second season left off. Shirou and Rin are still fighting in the Holy Grail War, Servants and Masters work to take out their enemies, and all the while greater implications are brought to the forefront.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a well-known term in anime and other mediums where narratives are involved. It\u2019s a negative one that most sane plots try to avoid because they literally don\u2019t make sense. This term is called the \u201cplot contrivance.\u201d In short, it\u2019s an event that isn\u2019t fully explainable or even natural in the context of the show. Think \u201cdeus ex machina\u201d where some godlike figure descends from heaven, someone thought dead reappears alive, or a character magically gains a brand new ability out of nowhere. The reasoning behind it is usually \u201cjust because.\u201d Their existence is often the product of the author or director writing himself or herself into a corner, with the only option available being a free out that lacks any basis.\\n\\n\r\nStay Night 2 doesn\u2019t partake in plot contrivances, but it constantly finds itself one step before, dabbling in something very similar called \u201cconvenient inconveniences.\u201d What are these? They\u2019re inconvenient events that just so happen to occur at precisely the convenient time for the plot to move in the direction it wishes for it to go. They are just barely believable and only marginally rational. But it\u2019s evident that the plot is being forced down a specific path rather than occurring naturally. Many anime have this, but so long as they aren\u2019t particularly egregious, frequent, or otherwise palpable to the viewer, they can more or less be excused.\\n\\n\r\nWhat exactly constitutes as a \u201cconvenient inconvenience\u201d and what doesn\u2019t? Let\u2019s start with something that isn\u2019t. At one point, Shirou, Saber, and Lancer arrive once more at Illya\u2019s mansion to confront Archer who had kidnapped Rin. Saber decides that, instead of going to her Master\u2019s side \u2013 the logical conclusion \u2013 she will stay here and witness the fight between the two men, letting Lancer be the hero. This already sounds dangerous and stupid. Not having everyone available to save such an important person seems like a bad move. Thankfully, Saber\u2019s decision to not help Rin is justified; the battle between Archer and Shirou is an outward representation of Saber\u2019s inner struggle. Meaning, Saber\u2019s decision coincides with the progression of the adventure (and by extension her character) thus far.\\n\\n\r\nNow, what is a \u201cconvenient inconvenience?\u201d Following Archer\u2019s death, Gilgamesh is ready to face off against a questioning Saber, a distraught Rin, and a severely broken Shirou. However, Gilgamesh decides not to fight them because\u2026there\u2019s too much soot in the air. This perfectly captures the idea. Gilgamesh literally doesn\u2019t fight the damaged trio because there\u2019s too much dust around him. It\u2019s a silly justification because the audience expects this confrontation to happen now, especially given the circumstances. Instead, the plot is pushed down a path that feels as if the anime wants it to go there rather than letting it happen naturally.\\n\\n\r\nThe word \u201cconstantly\u201d was used earlier because Stay Night 2 encounters and intentionally dives into this pitfall far too often to go unnoticed. Gilgamesh doesn\u2019t kill Rin and Shirou at Illya\u2019s mansion the first time because he\u2019s \u201ctoo tired\u201d from fighting Berserker despite being the greatest Servant of all-time with the most Noble Phantasms. Archer betrays Rin and Shirou and joins Caster, yet Caster lets them walk away because Archer asked her too while ironically wielding a weapon called \u201cRule Breaker.\u201d Lancer defeats Archer and has the chance to kill him but doesn\u2019t because \u201cmy job is done.\u201d Lancer manages to rise and defend Rin not once but twice in the span of five minutes after presumed perished. And even near the end, the Holy Grail manages to appear next to Gilgamesh after already being destroyed.\\n\\n\r\nThat last paragraph is basically a list, but they are all examples of the same tactic: artificially prolonging events through \u201cconvenient inconveniences.\u201d There are even more not listed here \u2013 such as Kotomine having Lancer kill himself rather than Rin or Shinji given the opportunity to escape the burning mansion \u2013 that further demonstrate the narrative\u2019s unnatural feel.\\n\\n\r\nOne argument against all of these examples is that they have some kind of justification backing them. For instance, Lancer living after killing himself derives from his overall terrible luck (is it unlucky or lucky that he missed his heart?) or Gilgamesh being so perturbed by getting particles on his clothes comes from his arrogant personality (why not just fight them outside?). But they\u2019re often flimsy or weak; they generally require the audience to scratch his or her head and say \u201cI guess\u2026\u201d in response. In essence it comes down to tolerance, but Say Night 2 teeters too much on the edge between acceptance and absurdity to give everything a free pass.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this says nothing of the inordinate amount of exposition used during the fight scenes, the disregard for needed information on topics such as the \u201cCounter Force\u201d or \u201cGuardians,\u201d and the show\u2019s plot twists being lackluster in execution. Here again there\u2019s an argument, that usually takes the form of \u201cread the visual novel.\u201d That\u2019s great, and without a doubt gives a more fulfilling experience. But on its own, as a standalone anime, there is no excuse to make the narrative as bogged down or as broken as it is. One shouldn\u2019t have to read other material to receive a complete offering. It\u2019s like reading a book that has removed key words or paragraphs and asks you to reference a different book to fill in the missing pieces. It\u2019s not fair to the audience and it\u2019s not fair to the narrative, and the same applies to anime.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nDue to the length of the previous section, this one will be kept short and sweet. To put it simply, Stay Night 2 has some of the best visuals in the medium. The background art is vivid, gorgeous, and realistic in its presentation; character designs are crisp, detailed, and appropriate for each person\u2019s personality and demeanor; and actual animation is consistently high when it comes to duels, hair, facial expressions, explosions, running, and any other form of movement. The studio behind the venture, ufotable, demonstrates that, if anything, they can create beautiful shows that captivate the eye.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s pretty fascinating how much talking is done and dialogue that ensues which ultimately leads to nowhere with the majority of the cast members. Some of the worst that this second season has to offer are Illya, Caster, Caster\u2019s Master Souichirou, and Lancer. Lancer plays a prominent role in the festivities but next to nothing is learned about him besides the honor that he holds. Souichirou is similar; he came from a faraway place and, outside of a singular flashback, we come to know very little about him. Caster also follows this same trend. We see her devotion to \u201cfair\u201d magic and her adoration towards Souichirou, but the vain attempt to make her likable near her departure doesn\u2019t work because of her present behavior and how little there is given of her past. As for Illya, she is granted an entire episode dedicated to making her less crazy and more relevant \u2013 due to how much she had been sidelined after her initial outing way back in the first season \u2013 but her immediate removal makes her a second-thought.\\n\\n\r\nThere are more, like Saber and Gilgamesh, who receive just enough attention to not be completely useless characters, but unfortunately aren\u2019t given the resources needed to make them worthwhile. Even Archer fails, having the same, repetitive backstory replayed over and over in an attempt to make his plight rational. The best side character is actually the one who appears the least; Assassin\u2019s talk of meaning, and the most important thing being what\u2019s directly in front of us, is one of the most profound insights the show had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the worst character though is Shirou. It\u2019s hard to say what sort of impact the Holy Grail War had on him. He seemingly goes through a ton of introspection, wondering if the convictions he has are the ones not just right for him but those he himself personally believes in. In short, he doesn\u2019t develop but instead goes through a reconfirmation, having his ideals reinforced through both a physical and mental battle with himself. He doesn\u2019t change his stance, he isn\u2019t looking to follow a new creed, and he can\u2019t seem to shake his unending stubbornness. He stays nearly the same for the entirety of the season, remaining quite the static character despite the dynamic events he experienced.\\n\\n\r\nRin is, surprisingly, the best character the anime has to offer. At the minimum, the viewer does see a gradual shift in her outlook. In the beginning, the War was for her and her alone; she had no wishes and was simply there to prove the strength of her and her family\u2019s name. But in Stay Night 2, her gaze transitions away from this goal. Now, she focuses on saving Archer and protecting Shirou \u2013 essentially the same thing, but instead of being so selfish it becomes clear that she does have a wish she wants to see fulfilled. Her determination is evident throughout, where she concocts plans to fight their adversaries, she shares her mana with Shrirou in a deeply personal moment, and nearly dies upholding his beliefs. Simultaneously, we also witness her open up in terms of relationships. Again, rather than being so self-centered, she: forms a pact with Saber, forgives Shinji for his treatment of her, and even boasts the romantic connection she and Shirou share. She isn\u2019t a spectacular character by any means, but she does manage, by comparison, to be a diamond in the rough.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is mysterious, with the vocalist doing the majority of the work; raspy and calm, she carries the piece where it needs to go, from foreboding lows to hopeful highs. The beat itself is strangely slow, but it works to give the piece a sort of \u201ctugging\u201d feel that gradually fills you with adrenaline. The guitar, like the vocalist, also performs overtime, making the whole package pretty darn cool. The ending theme isn\u2019t sad, but nor is it happy. It\u2019s a strange mix of the two, with the singers and instruments unifying to create a steady song that has a lot of power but lacks the impact required to make it memorable.\\n\\n\r\nListening to the rest of the soundtrack is rather pleasant. Each track is extremely orchestral in composition, with choirs and instruments that make everything feel as epic as it should. It\u2019s also capable of going emotional when it wants to or even branching out to more techno-filled pieces. Perhaps even more impressive than the tracks are the sound effects. The sword clashes, foot plantings, and replications give the fights and situations greater appeal than they would without such detailed sound-work.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the anime is above average in all cases. A special shout-out is deserved for Ayako Kawasumi as Saber for her refined speaking and signature \u201cEx\u2026caliber!\u201d Kana Ueda as Rin for her girly yet determined voice earns one as well, as does Noriaki Sugiyama as Shirou for all of the screaming and intense lines he gave. Realistically, many cast members deserve recognition for continuing to reprise the same roles to give the (entire) series a certain sense of authenticity.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWith all of this being said, I still had a good amount of fun with the anime. Rin is one of the best \u201ctsundere\u201d characters in the medium, with her adorable moments shining brightly. Saber is one of my favorite characters from the series, so seeing her in action (at least, in the latter half) was awesome to watch. I like her more than Rin, but since this isn\u2019t Saber\u2019s tale, there was less of Saber than I would have liked to have seen. And the battles, when theywere in full swing, such as with Lancer versus Archer and Shirou versus Gilgamesh, made me laugh in awe by how incredible they were. Some fights though, like Gilgamesh versus Berserker, were underwhelming, which was strange considering how strong they normally always are.\\n\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works 2nd Season is an entertaining anime, without question. Its art and animation is top-notch, its music is powerful, and specific scenarios are a lot of fun. But with the massive amount of errors in its story and the majority of the cast being offensively bad, it ends up as a disappointing conclusion to a popular series. Hopefully when Heaven\u2019s Feel comes around it doesn\u2019t \u201ctrace\u201d this one.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, \u201cconvenient inconveniences\u201d ruin the narrative, justifications are flaky, and awkward exposition tarnishes anything it attempts to do\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, beautiful visuals, nice character designs, above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, the majority, from Illya to Shinichirou to Saber to even Shirou, are executed poorly, with only Rin and Assassin coming out on top\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, nice OP, okay ED, good soundtrack, nice sound effects, above average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, Rin is cute, Saber\u2019s appearances were entertaining, and some of the battles were fun but not much else was\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "After the first season of FSN:UBW I had high hopes that the second season would make up for at least some of the issues I had with season 1.  It turns out it did not in almost any way.  I am not a reader of the VN, but that doesn't change the fact that a series needs to work as a standalone piece without the aid of extra information provided by the source material to completely enjoy it.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story continues directly after season 1 (as one might assume) and the pace picks up considerably since season 1 had so much Shirou cookingand Rin whining to get through that it was like the Holy Grail War just hit the freakin' pause button for the majority of the season.  However, the quicker pace is not necessarily a good thing.  In fact, after the first couple of episodes there were so many character farewells that it was almost like, \"I can't WAIT to see what this character has in store for the series-... oh... they're dead now... after being in 2 episodes... hmm...\"  The pacing of this season was odd, to say the least, with important events being hurled at you one after another in one episode, then in the next episode nothing happens at all.  Some plot elements were left dreadfully vague as well, most often dealing with Archer's backstory and Shirou suddenly obtaining OP Servant-level abilities.  Because of this, the climax was poorly executed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is still top-notch for the most part, but with some flaws mostly dealing with mediocre CG integration for some backgrounds.  Fight scenes still look awesome (even if the outcomes of some fights make no sense).  The Opening theme in particular is more entertaining to watch than season 1.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nI may never hear an anime score as bland as this one ever again.  The only salvageable track is EMIYA which comes from the VN anyways, but the  original tracks are disappointingly dull.  Fight scenes sound like something that was rejected from Hans Zimmer's studio with enough fast percussion and BWAHs to make me feel like I was being incepted.  The insert song by Aimer was similarly bland and actually made me laugh when it showed up in an integral scene as it sucked out any of the drama or impact the scene possessed.  Besides that, the Japanese VAs do their job well.  I particularly like Archer's voice since it really suits him.  In regards to SFX, hearing the same sword clash sound for the thousandth time got a bit annoying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nI had hoped the second season would make up some lost ground on this front, but it failed to in quite a few ways.  First of all, many characters who deserved further development were killed off so quickly and pointlessly, that by the end, I forgot they were even a part of the show.  Some characters don't show up for 10-15 episodes just to be killed in a single episode as if they never mattered.  Shirou remains one of my least favorite anime protagonists.  The show does a poor job of explaining anything about his trace ability making it seem like he gains random powers out of nowhere that he can use to beat anyone/thing.  Not only that, but the big power-up he receives from Rin is one of the biggest Deus Ex Machina I've seen since he's pretty much unstoppable afterwards.  Shirou's personality is fittingly terrible as well since he wants to save everyone so much that he lacks any form of common sense.  While I get that that's kind of the point of his character, it doesn't make it any less frustrating when he somehow succeeds at everything.  Can he just die? Seriously.  How is he not dead?  Why did Gilgamesh go from being the strongest servant to being a complete joke of a character?  I think Lancer is the only character that I came out liking enough to consider my favorite.  He had admirable screen time and was a total badass.  I attribute the lack of good characters both to potentially poor adaption as well as flawed source material.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nThere were some episodes of FSN:UBW that I thought worked well and enjoyed watching while others were flat-out frustrating and left me weary of watching the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nI can only hope that the Heaven's Feel movie will provide a more interesting story with more interesting characters, a more interesting soundtrack, and a less buffoonish MC. \\n\r\n*avoiding spoilers*",

So where this anime falls short is the pacing of the entire show.\r\nThe pacing was excruciating slow each episode. It took a really long time for the characters to do something resulting in bad payoff each week of an episode. They should've cut some of that slice of life scenes as well as their investigation scenes and concentrated on various characters instead of following just those two main characters all the time. \r\nThis is why fate/zero was awesome, we got to know various characters storiesand motivations including their \"Heroes\" and we also got to see how they all reacted to each other and each others motivation. In fate/zero something always seem to happen each episode, resulting in good payoff. In fate/stay night we just concentrate on our main protagonists all the time and they aren't very interested themselves.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the payoff for this series felt lacking till the end. It felt as if nothing was happening for most of the entire series (until the end episodes).",

However, by season 2 I was already engrossed in this animation \u2014 one of the best of Spring 2015, although the English subs were somewhat difficult to comprehend at times. Shiro executed his role of Baka/OP MC flawlessly (another great line by him this season to watch out for: \"just because you're correct doesn't mean you're right\"), alongside strong female lead Tosaka Rin. I quite liked their somewhat unconventional romance mingled in with all the gory action. \r\nThe sound and visuals were breath taking \u2014 they reallyput a lot of effort into the aesthetics of it. One of the main reasons why this anime was pure epic is credited to the amount of money spent. It just goes to show that Unlimited Budget Works.",

Expect spoilers ahead.\r\nI\u2019m not a big fan of this cour (or season as MAL insists). It failed in everything it needed to do. The Caster arc was not really good since Caster was a plain villain. Ilya\u2019s death failed to make at least a little impact on the show (This is why Heaven\u2019s Feel exists). The characters in the show just come and go. Archer vs Shirou and his ideals produced episodes of tedious and repetitive dialogues. The dialogues are overwritten and awkward. Gilgamesh seemed tobe a decent final villain. Rin remains a generic tsunderin. The plot is decent enough but it\u2019s characters suffer.\\n\\n\r\nUfotable has done an exemplary job in its production. We have decent choreographed fights, godtier animation, detailed backgrounds. The VN soundtrack has it\u2019s cameo which I really really like. Aimer\u2019s Brave Shine and Last Stardust are great songs, Brave Shine captures the atmosphere of the show by Aimer\u2019s amazing vocals. Same with Last Stardust. Overall, the OSTs are godtier.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night is decent at best. It\u2019s not really bad, not necessarily good either. Mediocre plot and characters, godtier OST and animation. It\u2019s a shame actually, Nasuverse is one heck of a fictional universe, I really like Fate\u2019s worldbuilding but it have to suffer from Fate\u2019s story, Kara no Kyoukai is better than Fate. I\u2019m gonna rate this a 6. It\u2019s mediocre but it was pretty enjoyable to the least, and ufotable\u2019s production saved it.

            "content": "Note: this is my review for both seasons\r\nThis is an adaption of 1 of the 3 routes from the famous VN Fate/stay night, hearing that this was getting Produced by the same studio as Fate/ Zero got me really excited as I consider Fate/ Zero to be a Great Anime, so did Fate/stay night  Unlimited blade Works live up to the Hype ? \r\nStory 8.5/10\r\nLet\u2019s start with the story, Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works is the story of a secret tournament between seven chosen mages that happens in the shadows of our modern day world. Each mage is paired with a legendary figure frommyth or history and the last pair standing receives the ultimate prize: the wish-granting Holy Grail, we follow Rin as our female heroine along with Shirou, the story is about Shirou\u2019s ideals and where they will eventually lead him.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is great and I don\u2019t want to go into detail as to what happens because there are great twists in the series which need to be experienced first-hand, however I do feel like certain stuff happens in the show only because of plot convenience, I\u2019m trying to keep this review spoiler free but a certain character is supposed to be dead but later appears with no real explanation, there are a couple of plausible theories as to why this certain character survived but the show doesn\u2019t confirm these theories nor does it give an explanation. Plot conveniences is throughout the show however they don\u2019t really take you out of the moment and it doesn\u2019t affect your experience. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is very simple, the art and animation is the best I have seen from any anime TV series Ufotable have solidified their name as one of the best studios when it comes to Art and animation. \\n\\n\r\nSound and Music 10/10\\n\\n\r\nTaste in music is always subjective but the soundtrack in Fate is amazing they have remixed soundtracks from the original Visual novel which gives each scene a sense of awe and amazement, and the themes done by Aimer and Kalafina are amazing especially the second Opening \u201cBrave Shine\u201d\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe visual novel Fate Stay Night is split into 3 different and unique routes where the main heroine in each route is different, so it is obvious that some character will not get development because their character will get developed in the other routes so when judging this route I will only consider what this route was supposed to do which was Shirou and where his ideals would lead him.\\n\\n\r\nShirou Emiya is our main character, from the start he annoyed me quite a lot his decision came across idiotic, and he is like a shadow, a shell of Kiritsugu. Shirou Emiya doesn't exactly stand for anything and his understanding of the world and the way of life is full of hypocrisy however later on in the series when he got character development, he becomes more likeable and more relatable and we got to appreciate why he does the things he does, however the pacing of his development wasn\u2019t handled good in my personal opinion, he had very slow character development, when he encounters a certain obstacle the amount of development he gets completes his characters, before this encounter he seemed really weak compared to other opponents and after this encounter he gets an insane power up, the transition with his character development could have been handled better.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling Archer is my favourite character in the series, he is completely badass and when his identity is revealed along with his goal you get to feel for his character and get a greater understanding as to why he does the thing he does.\\n\\n\r\nRin Tohsaka is another stand out character in the series, she is one of the more justifiable Tsundere in anime as she has lost both her parents and was raised by kotomine kirie ( if you haven\u2019t seen Fate/Zero  basically he is not your ideal Guardian) she is socially awkward, she always has a personal boundary around her not letting people in and is very independent, she in the series helps Shirou through the War and provides the plans and strategies on taking down the other servants.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was a great anime which kept me coming back each week and was one of the few anime of 2014/1015 to keep me invested in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 92% \\n\\n\r\nNOTE: A lot of people will complain that a lot of questions are unanswered in this route or it doesn\u2019t give the same vibes as Fate/Zero, this is ONLY 1/3 of the Fate/stay night story and to get a true appreciation of the great story telling you will have to view the fate series as it was designed, 3 parallel stories which complimented each other which were all supposed to be experienced.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you are a fan of the Fate franchise I would definitely recommend you to watch this show, it is a lot better than the 2006 version but doesn\u2019t have the same mature themes which i loved about Fate/ Zero.\\n\\n\r\n 9.2 rounded to the nearest whole number : 9 \\n",

So if I didn't understand something from an adaptation that I would understand in the source material, then the adaptation fail to properly adapt the material properly. Nowthat I have gotten that out of the way, on with the review.\\n\\n\r\nThe Fate series generally revolve around a simple premise of seven mages who summon seven servants, who are reincarnations of legendary historic figures, to fight for them in a battle royal with the goal of obtaining the Holy Grail, which can grant the wielder any wish conceivable.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the premise is fairly simple and kind of silly sounding when you think about it, with proper handling, it can work. While I have my gripes with Fate Zero, it served the series well and presented some interesting ideas and conflicts. So with good execution, this show can work. But unfortunately, Unlimited Blade Works execution is rather sub par and fail to do anything interesting with the material.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first start watching this show, I was under the pretense that this show was suppose to be like a battle royal, with each of the master trying to get the upper hand on each other. However, it instead feels more like a 3rd rate battle shonen than an actual death tournament. All the major events that transpire throughout the show always feels unbelievable forced and contrived. I think a big factor that comes into play is how the anime heavily relies on \u201cplot convenience\u201d. Plot convenience is a tool that a lazy writer would use to move a plot in the direction he/she want it to go without necessary making sense in the context of the story. This happens multiple of times over the course of UBW. At one point, the main villain Gilgamesh was ready to face off the main heroes Shirou. Rin, and Saber. But Gilgamesh decides not to fight them for absolutely no reason. The \u201cplot convenience\u201d makes the entire show feel forced and unnatural breaking any of the suspension of disbelief that the viewer might of had.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime try to gives some justification to these conveniences, but most of them come off as weak and silly at best. For example, Gilgamesh excuse for not kill the Shiroe and Rin is because of his extreme arrogance, That is like the most used excuse for why the main villain doesn't kill the main villain. And who really buys that argument? No one I know would be that stupidly arrogant to let an enemy go and think that it won't be any repercussions. And it doesn\u2019t help that Gilgamesh level of arrogance is taken to such an extreme that he might as well been a James Bond villain.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, since this is a Type Moon adaption, there is a slew of magic terminology being used. Without any context of these terms, many of the plot twists fall flat on their face. I know the fans would excuse this by telling me \u201cgo read the visual novel\u201d, and I would point them to the first paragraph I typed.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, there isn\u2019t actually that much to write about most of them. Most of the cast except for the Shiroe and Rin get very little in terms of characterization. Caster and Lancer, who have a fairly big roles in the story, only get a some flashback as the extent of their characterization. Some characters don\u2019t even get this treatment. Rider, for example, was just there and ended up just to be killed off screen some randy. Archer, Saber, and Gilgamesh, though received more than the rest, characterization can be summed up in a few words. \\n\r\nSo that would leave the two main characters, Tosaka Rin and Emiya Shirou.\\n\\n\r\nRin is suppose to the be primarily love interest and partner for Shirou. Bizarrely, she is the best character in the entire show. Yes, her motivations make no bloody sense ( i have no idea why she decides to help Shirou in the Holy Grail war since I am pretty sure she knows that she have to eventually turn on him since it is a death tournament ), but she has the most characterization out of the entire cast and actually change as a character ( though it is quite dragged out). And she is a character who actually takes an active role in the story. She isn\u2019t necessarily a great character, or even a good one. But one thing I will admit I prefer Rin over mentally impaired Shirou Emiya. \\n\\n\r\nShirou is one of the most repulsive character I have ever seen to date. He have some sort of complex where he put lives of people around above his own life. This isn\u2019t bad on its own, but the anime take this complex to such a degree that it comes off as idiotic. He\u2019s an annoying, bland , obnoxious character who is sadly the spotlight of the entire show. But the most frustrating part of his character is his idealism. At first, show seem to know where to take ideals. In the second season, Shirou fell under the criticism of Archer, who calls out on Shirou\u2019s bullshit and try to convince Shirou to abandon his unreachable ideals and bring up convincing points like how contradictory his idealism is. Archer saids these exact words to Shirou \"Fighting for others, but not yourself, is nothing but hypocrisy.\" And there is Gilgamesh who calls Shiroe a \u201cfake\u201d, since he claims tha Shirou inherit his ideals from his foster father Kiritsugu. For some time, the show actually look like its trying to make a point. Normally, one would expect Shirou to realize how naive his ideals are and gasp* actually abandon his ideals and develop as a character. Sadly, that was too good to be true. Instead he just have some random epiphany out of nowhere that some how his ideals are right despite all the evidence against his ideals. I guess the thought \u201c Just because you are correct doesn\u2019t mean you are right.\u201d\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade Works is mediocre show at best. It\u2019s has a extremely linear plot and lackluster characters polished up with good animation and music. If you simply want to watch an anime for good animation and music and nothing else, I would recommend UBW. But if you are looking for more than that, I would urge you to look else where.",

            "content": "UNRIMITED BRAYDUH WORKUSU!!!!!!!\r\nYo yo yo!! It's the hippity hype hype hype second season of the greatest porn game adaptation ever made, right???? The show that got everyone to throw money at the screen, all for the sake of our lord and savior Ufotable, who totally knows how to spend their cash money. \r\nSo how does UNRIMITED BRAYDUH WORKUSU season 2 stand up to the first season? Well, it kinda fell flat... as flat as Illya's rack...\r\nWhy do people watch Fate/Stay Night UBW in the first place? Is it for the substantial story? Nah. Is it for the amazing character development? As if! Is it forthe PRETTY COLORS and the badass action scenes? You guessed it!\\n\\n\r\nThe second season is even less logical and even more Shounen-esque than the already illogical and shounen-esque first season. How you manage to do that is beyond me, but season 2 nailed it perfectly! But Yuni! Isn't that why people watch this series? For the stupid  brain dead action scenes? Yeah, but the things is, there is even less action in season 2 than there is in season 1! It's just talking!\\n\\n\r\nBasically, FSNUBW pulled off something completely opposite to that of Fate/Zero. Instead of building up the tension with a stupidly large amount of talking and finishing it off with a thrilling finale, Unlimited Blade Works hooks you in at the beginning with badass action scenes, only to fall to long as fuck speeches performed by Archer. Dude, Archer talks so much in this season. He's talking when he's standing, talking when he's sitting, talking when he's in a flashback, and even talking when he's fighting. And when he isn't talking, Gilgamesh is talking! What's up with the archer class and talking????\\n\\n\r\nSo what else is different about season 2 that makes it a bit worse than season 1? Well, just like I said earlier! Season 2 throws out almost all logic out the window and just becomes a complete clusterfuck that I could barely take seriously. It tries so hard! I guess I could give it an A for effort, but seriously? It just reveals random things and I'm sitting there like \"Oh ok, I guess that's a thing.\" But then it reveals something else right after and I'm just like \"What? That changes everything!\" Blah blah blah you know what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a death game, for sure, but the only ones who die are the ones who DON'T GO TO HIGH SCHOOL! The most incompetent of masters manage to survive due to the armor made of the legendary Plotinum. Especially Shirou, who gets the most Shounen-esque of power ups in the most Shounen-esque of ways. \\n\\n\r\nNot to mention, the fan service has been upped SIGNIFICANTLY. I mean one of the first scenes you see in the first episode is Saber looking all sexy, getting bondaged on. The show also loves to zoom in on TsundeRin's butt and legs, exploiting everyone with a thigh highs fetish, constantly putting her in suggestive situations. But what did you expect? After all, it's a PORN GAME adaptation! Don't shoot me.\\n\\n\r\nSo why did I still give this season, a season who didn't live up to the quality of the first, a 5/10? Because I may or may not have a thigh highs fetish...\\n\\n\r\nJk, cause of the feels Illya gave me and the few good action scenes that this season had.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: EKUSU CARIBAHHHHHHH!!!!!\\n",

            "content": "Do note that my review on this series covers both seasons to the Unlimited Blade Works series and not for the separate seasons alone. Making this clear, let me press on with the review.\r\nIn spite of being a fan of Type-Moon's work, my feelings are a little mixed for this reboot of Fate's Unlimited Blade Works route. This new adaptation from Ufotable is a reboot from the film version made by Studio Deen five years earlier and is at least a considerable improvement over the film version. With the greater amount of time afforded to the TV version, there is more time to build upevents that take place throughout the series, show off lighter moments to balance out the serious developments that take place throughout the Grail War and flesh out major characters throughout its run. In the case of UBW, the focus of the route is on Shiro's developing relationship with Rin and the boy coming to grips with the flaws to his idealized beliefs when a shocking revelation is unveiled over what sort of future he would be in for from another prominent character in the series. The kid's grown up with a rough life as he was victim to the events that took place in the conclusion of Fate/Zero and became orphaned after the loss of both his biological parents and adoptive father Kiritsugu. The development of his character and others here offers a good deal more depth to this series compared to Deen condensing such events for its film adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThe way that Ufotable adapted the UBW route for this TV anime adaptation is what has made my reception to it a bit mixed. For the most part, Ufotable is faithful to the original source material in terms of plot and character developments that take place. However to pad out time or expand on areas that the visual novel did not devote time for, the anime does make a number of changes and additions for key scenes that take place throughout the series. A number of these changes are welcome as they help to expand depth on some key characters in the series like Ilyasviel, Gilgamesh and Saber, who aren't given as much prominent focus in the game as Rin, Shiro and Archer got greater priority for fleshing out. The additional content also helps to provide some more natural flow to the plot progression since the visual novel was originally told through Shiro's perspective for the most part thus viewers were limited in what information they could be provided due to Shiro's limited understanding of magic unless the series cut to an interlude scene to show a differing viewpoint from other characters. Another plus was that the anime removed many of the meal scenes found in the game as they had little place within the plot beyond dragging the plot out. The anime also has nods to Fate/Zero as Saber makes reference to some of the key events that took place from the prior Grail War, some notable characters from the series make cameos at points and Gilgamesh retains his personality from that series, giving him a bit more depth to his character compared to the visual novel adaptation of his character where he was an archetypal villain.\\n\\n\r\nThese changes do come with their shortcomings though. The additional content leads the plot to drag out at a number of points, this being quite noticeable in the second half of the series during a few of UBW's major points in its plot. It also creates some inconsistencies in the show's plot at points in regards to whatever rules were laid out with magic in the world of Fate. Plus, they make a few characters in the series worst off in their developments than they were in the game as the anime bumped up Rin's tsundere character at points to make her character a bit obnoxious and Caster's character being rather inconsistent in her depiction as a combination of changed and removed content made it confusing if one should sympathize with her or not as the visual novel depicted with her back story.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the flaws with UBW being a visual novel series also rear their head at points. In spite of having major roles to play at points in the series, Lancer and Kuzuki get limited depth compared to many of the other major players in the series and those having reduced roles compared to other routes from the visual novel get little in the way of fleshing out, this being notable with Sakura and Rider.\\n\\n\r\nAs one would expect from many of Ufotable's works, Fate/UBW offers up one of the more visually impressive TV anime titles you can expect out of recent titles. The drawing style is a bit different from Fate/Zero as character lining and coloring is more lighter, likely to differentiate the series from Zero's more darker storyline as UBW has its light moments to balance out the serious developments that take place in the series. Backgrounds and scenery are vast and richly filled with detail. Movement in the series is fluid with no loss of detail or noticeable shortcuts and action scenes are engaging to see for the most part. Only sore spot I found with the visuals were occasions where conspicuous CG animation reared its ugly head with vehicles and the skeleton familiars summoned by Caster.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did enjoy Unlimited Blade Works and found it to be a major improvement over Deen's film adaptation, a number of the changes done to the storyline at points did hurt its quality with some pacing issues and inconsistencies. Still if you're a fan of Type-Moon and Ufotable's work, I'd be hard pressed not to recommend this TV animated adaptation to Fate/ Stay Night's Unlimited Blade Works route.",

            "content": "\"Nobody said that a fake can't beat the real thing.\" - Emiya Shirou\r\nFate/stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works was the most enjoyable anime that I watched in the recent year, because nearly everything about it pandered greatly to my shounen taste for action, inspiration, surprise and awe. This is the gripping story of an idealist who overcame all odds, including himself and his own ideals. Though he was weak and his ideals were flawed, never once did he stop believing, never once did he back down, and never once did he stop acting like the Hero of Justice that he always wanted to become.\r\nTL;DR\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nSound:9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nGood points:\\n\r\n+ Very exciting and gripping plot\\n\r\n+ Unexpected plot twists\\n\r\n+ Good thematic discourse in the plot\\n\r\n+ Outstanding quality of art and music\\n\r\n+ Very well developed characters, both main and supporting\\n\r\n+ Realistic and believable characters and motives with back stories\\n\r\n+ Excellent action sequences\\n\r\n+ Complete and satisfying resolution\\n\\n\r\nBad points:\\n\r\n- Some plot holes and inconsistencies\\n\r\n- Pacing could be faster in the 1st season\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEven from the prologue, the anime throws us straight into the action. We are introduced to the concept of the Holy Grail War, and all out battle royale between 7 masters and their respective servants, or Heroic Spirits, for the ultimate prize: fulfillment of any wish they may so have. This main conflict enraptures our protagonists, Rin and Shirou, willingly or unwillingly, into a bloodbath that lasts from start to finish (+1 for main overarching conflict) \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of episode 0, we have already witnessed an amazing fight sequence between Archer and Lancer and a character dying and coming back to life. But the adrenaline doesn't die off there, it merely builds up throughout the rest of the story. More and more servants and their masters are revealed, leaving us wondering how all of this is going to play out. We are first introduced to the protagonistic servants Archer and Saber. Then, in comes Ilya with Berserker, whose massive strength outclasses that of both. Throw in a Rider-class servant who attacks the school that Rin and Shirou are in, as well as a crafty and cunning Caster who is responsible for many of the gas leak incidents around the city, and viola - you have an excellent recipe for exciting things to come. (+2 for originality and excitement)\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, we are craving for fights and all-out brawls where servants use their special abilities, Noble Phantasms, to strike one another down, but the anime just pokes and teases us with clashes that result in stalemate after stalemate after stalemate. The anime is telling us that things simply aren't so simple, and begins to churn out all the different and unexpected twists.\\n\\n\r\nIn the middle of Blood Fort Andromeda, a mysterious servant finishes off Rider and leaves Shinji so scared he can't even describe the servant when confronted by Rin. Caster uses Rule Breaker to take control of Saber, in a horrific hostage situation. Archer betrays Shirou and Rin, in one of the most dire of situations. There is a mysterious man in blond hair that we see glimpses of every now and then but we don't know his role in the war just yet. Things just start going horribly, horribly wrong and I'm just left wondering if our protagonists are ever going to make it out of this war alive. (+1 for plot twists)\\n\\n\r\nAnd then, we have the showdown that gives this entire anime its meaning in the first place - the face-off between Archer and Shirou, the future self fighting with his past self. Shirou, the idealist, cannot bring himself to believe in anything else other than his dream of a future where everybody lives happily ever after, where there are no deaths and wars and where all live in peace. Archer, the realist who once committed himself to accomplishing those same ideals, now living in regret because he realizes that his life's striving was all in vain because of the malevolence of humankind.\\n\\n\r\nIn many ways, this pivotal battle is a reflection of our inner idealist and realist, at odds at one another and telling us to do things differently. On one hand, a part of us wants to believe in a perfect utopia and wants to work towards it, one another hand, a part of us says it isn't possible and that it will all be for naught. Both cannot accept one another, though both are correct, and it is only up to us to decide which path is \"right\" for us to take. (+1 for thematic development)\\n\\n\r\nThe final battle, between that of Shirou and Gilgamesh, is just as meaningful, if not more. Gilgamesh, the King of Heroes, who featured also in Fate/Zero as the unstoppable, overpowered self-sustaining Archer-class Servant, facing off against a weak human, Shirou, in a battle that should honestly have been decided in a mere second, if only Gilgamesh had the humility to acknowledge Shirou as a worthy opponent. Gilgamesh's collection of Noble Phantasms within the Gate of Babylon boasts of \"originality\", while he spites Shirou's projections of swords from his mind as mere fakes and imitations.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, this battle ultimately poses to each of us the true question of what exactly is real and what exactly is fake. It even probes further into the idea that perhaps it is not the originality of the entity that gives it meaning, but its user. Shirou applies this idea to his ideals, the very ones that he gained only from Kiritsugu, whom he looked up to. Though Archer constantly mocked him for having \"borrowed ideals\" from other people, not having anything that he could claim as truly his own, Shirou rose above that and taught us that even if our ideals are borrowed, or fakes, or mere imitations, it is what we, as proponents and believers in such ideals, make of them, that give rise to the true meaning of those same ideals we stand for. (+1 for complexity)\\n\\n\r\nThere are many other interesting plot themes that the anime brings up so I'll briefly state them here. Loyalty, as exemplified by Saber, but also in Berserker's self-sacrifice for his master, Ilya. Betrayal, as exemplified by Archer, but also in Caster's spite for her original master, as well as Kotomine's deception of Rin. And finally, the sanctity of human life, as shown by Shirou's unwillingness to accept anyone who trivialized human life, and also in Rin and Saber.\\n\\n\r\nIn general, the story did make sense and there were no groundbreaking plot destroying loopholes. It was not a far stretch to believe in the assumptions upon which the war was grounded on, such as the various rules regarding the Master-Servant pact, the powers of their Noble Phantasms and the existence of anomalies, Gilgamesh, Assassin and Kotomine, in the war itself. (+1 believable assumptions)\\n\\n\r\nThe story was also resolved in a very satisfying manner, with all loose ends tied up. (+1 for reasonable resolution) There was however, a key point of contention that I would like to make regarding Archer's consistency in episode 7. More information about this is located under the plot holes section at the end of the review. Archer just seems so inconsistent in this episode that it's a shame I have to deduct plot points just for this. I also cannot give this anime any bonus points because there are also some plot holes that surface. For the full list, you may scroll down to the bottom of this review to have a look. But be warned, there are spoilers so read at your own risk!\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the plot is very well done, save for a few minor plot holes and inconsistencies here and there. The story is epic, it's thrilling and it's full of twists, depth and thematic discourse that it's bound to have you hooked from start to the finish.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 3/3\\n\r\nI'm giving this a solid full score because really, the animators really did a very good job with all the fast-paced action scenes. The animation was very crisp, sharp and added a lot of colour and flavour to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetics: 3/3\\n\r\nThe character designs were just beautiful, as were the background scenes and landscape shots in the anime. Nothing looked out of place and everything was woven very well together.\\n\\n\r\nOP Sequences: 2/2\\n\r\nBoth OPs were very well thought-out, featuring many of the characters as well as great action shots.\\n\\n\r\nED Sequences: 2/2\\n\r\nThe ED sequences were very nice as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Theme 1: 2/2\\n\r\nThis was the best theme of the entire anime, as it was upbeat and exciting enough that I would always let it play every episode up to 12.\\n\\n\r\nOP Theme 2: 2/2\\n\r\nThis theme was also pretty good, and matched well with the OP Sequence. Though I definitely preferred OP1.\\n\\n\r\nED Theme 1: 2/2\\n\r\nThis ED theme was very beautiful and was also upbeat, so that's a plus.\\n\\n\r\nED Theme 2: 1/2\\n\r\nI liked ED1 better.\\n\\n\r\nBackground Music: 2/2\\n\r\nDefinitely top-notch. It was suspenseful, exciting, uplifting, nostalgic all at the appropriate times and added greatly to the overall mood of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are so many amazing characters in this anime that I hardly know where to start, but I guess I'll just start off with my favourite.\\n\\n\r\nArcher, Rin's Servant, is probably the most clever at deducing the best course of action he should take at any given time. The fact that he's a badass dual sword-wielding bowman with a Noble Phantasm named after the anime is just the tip of the iceberg. (+1 for awesomeness) Archer is shown to have a rather cold personality from the beginning, but throughout the anime, you can easily tell that there's a lot more compassion under that exterior than meets the eye. He saves Shirou many times, despite disliking him to the core. (+1 for multi-faceted nature) Archer also slowly grows to accept himself, realizing that no matter how hard he tried to dissuade Shirou and to get him to give up his foolish ideals, Shirou wouldn't give in. This same growth can be seen in Shirou, though in this case, I would consider both Archer and Shirou the same person for this review. (+1 for vital growth)\\n\\n\r\nRin, the female protagonist in the story, is simply irresistible. She's smart, witty, beautiful, cute and a tsundere all at the same time. Basically she's almost perfect in everything, save for the fact that she's still young and still makes mistakes, but even that's adorable. (+1 for personality development) Rin is also a capable mage, with many different spells in her arsenal, from the standard Gandr attack to flash bangs and defensive spells, and she doesn't back down in a fight even against a superior mage, proving her courage. (+1 for awesomeness) Though Rin doesn't really get romantically involved with Shirou any time in the anime, it is clear that she likes him, and that she is constantly in conflict with herself for having a soft spot yet having to be rational to win the Holy Grail War. She slowly moves from being embarrassed about admitting that she likes Shirou, to being able to openly declare it in front of others. (+1 for relationship progress) The couple are practically a match made in heaven so there's no reason not to root for them, really.\\n\\n\r\nI really like how the anime managed to flesh out the back stories of Caster and Berserker. With Caster, we were able to see not only how cunning and scheming she was from the beginning, but also her emotional state which really made me sad when she was killed in the end. Kuzuki described Caster as not knowing what she truly wanted, which was to go back to the time when she was alive, and this also made me feel for her. (+1 for backstory) Her eventual self-sacrifice for her master, though it was for naught, was proof that she had learnt something new because of Kuzuki's mercy and benevolence to her. (+1 for character growth).\\n\\n\r\nIn the case of Berserker, we could see a lot of Ilya's backstory and how she came to be a master in the Holy Grail War. As the pinnacle of the Einzbern family's research, Ilya was their only hope. Ilya essentially carried the burden of the entire family, homunculus and all, and took it upon that small frame of hers to fight in the war. It's actually pretty brave if you think about it.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I would like give some credit to our main antagonist, Gilgamesh as well. Though everybody hates him for being super overpowered and such, at least his motives for destroying humanity were not shallow and circular in nature. As a king, he considered only those who would be spared by the Grail to by worthy to be citizens in his kingdom of sorts. (+1 for convincing motives)\\n\\n\r\nI definitely had no qualms about the character development because the anime really put so much effort into this that even I was very emotionally invested in many of them, even much of the supporting cast was so diverse and unique, that I had to give them credit. From the school, there was the shy Sakura, the bubbly and overzealous Fujimura-sensei, even Mitsuzuri and Issei, all of whom had very diverse and interesting personalities and traits. Even the fake Assassin, Koujirou Sasaki had a clear distinct personality as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I thought was really a waste was that they didn't really give Kotomine enough time to let his evil schemes shine. Kotomine was a real gem of a character back in Fate/Zero, and it was a bit pitiful to see him being reduced to just an evil scheming priest in this anime. I would have hope that he would be more vital to the plot, but he turned out not to be, despite being part of a key plot twist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nExcitement: 3/3\\n\r\nFirst off, this anime really delivers when it comes to the excitement. The action is there with the accompanying music and top notch animation, there are many unexpected plot twist and turns which just keep you off the edge of your seat, and they are always certain to leave behind certain unanswered questions just to keep you watching episode after episode like I did.\\n\\n\r\nHumour: 1/3\\n\r\nWhile humour was not their strongest suit, there was definitely quite a bit involved. Some of the funny scenes I can remember off-hand are:\\n\r\n1. When Shirou stripped Issei to find out if he was a master\\n\r\n2. When Rin used Archer as a maid and Archer replied, \"Go to hell, master.\"\\n\r\n3. After the magic circuit transfer when Rin asks Shirou if \"He saw it.\"\\n\r\n4. When Lancer pokes Shinji with his lance and Shinji runs off terrified\\n\\n\r\nEmotion: 2/3\\n\r\nI really felt for many of the characters in the anime. From supporting characters like Ilya and Caster to the main cast, I was rooting for them all the way. Many of the deaths were very dramatic and emotional indeed, but not overly so, whilst you could also really feel the relationships and interactions between the masters and their servants. Whenever Rin cries, even I get a little teary too.\\n\\n\r\nPacing: 2/3\\n\r\nThis could honestly have been improved a bit because I felt that the first 12 episodes were a bit too draggy. The 2nd season had much better pacing and the plot progressed a lot faster, but I thought the 1st season really spent too much time with all the stalemates, all of which left only 1 servant defeated by the end of it. Then towards the end in the last few episodes, servants were being killed off too quickly in a row.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime gets a bonus point for having no filler episodes. (+1) This was definitely an awesome anime that I thoroughly enjoyed, so I have no reason not to give it a good score.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nInitially, I was very annoyed with Shirou, just like Archer was, and I couldn't accept how stubborn he was with his foolish ideals. But eventually, I grew to like both Shirou and Archer as one character, and I found true meaning in Shirou's words as he kept repeating the words \"even then\". I realized that Shirou was acting out of more than just stubborn resolve and foolish ignorance, he was acting out of a hope and a dream that he was never willing to give up on. In Shirou's own words, even if it is impossible, \"it can't be wrong\" to live for that dream.\\n\\n\r\nSpoilers ahead! Read only if you have finished watching the anime!\\n\\n\r\nI was also very surprised when Archer reappeared in episode 24 to save both Rin and Saber. I had assumed he had died back in episode 21 to Gilgamesh's swords. But upon closer inspection, I found that unlike all the other servants who died, Archer was the only whose corpse wasn't actually shown vanishing. Only trails of particles were seen after the explosion, but nothing like a body actually fading away, so I guess I can still believe that his Independent Action ability kept him alive.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a total of 13 plot holes that I found in this anime:\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1\\n\r\nRin had to say a super long and complicated incantation before she could invoke a command spell, but all Shirou said was \"Stop it, Saber!\" and his command spell was automatically invoked? It seems like the writer just wanted to conveniently make both Rin and Shirou have 1 less Command Spell each and be at a disadvantageous position from the start.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 5\\n\r\nRin comments that the girl who collapsed had been \"drained dry\" of her mana, then states that she hardly has any blood left. This link between a person's blood and mana though, is still very vague and unclear. Why does draining someone of their mana result in also a draining of their blood?\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6\\n\r\nIn the last few minutes of episode 5, while Shirou talks to Rin, he admits that he can't really call himself a mage. But right after that scene at the start of episode 6, when Shirou challenges Archer, he confidently calls himself a mage, though inexperienced. Shirou here seems inconsistent with his assessment of his own magic ability.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 7\\n\r\nArcher claims that Caster broke the rules by summoning an Assassin-class Servant for herself, but where are these stated rules exactly? Kotomine clearly did not mention that there cannot be more than 7 servants in the Holy Grail War, especially since Gilgamesh still features as an extra.\\n\r\nSo I'm honestly not sure what kind of \"rules\" Archer is following at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nArcher doesn't finish off an injured Caster because he says that his objective was Shirou and that he came here of his own volition rather than being ordered by Rin, and thus has no reason to kill Caster. But earlier in episode 2, when Rin and Shirou are returning from the church, Archer told Rin specifically that if the opportunity to kill an easily defeated enemy presents itself, then that opportunity ought to be taken. This clearly shows that this is not Archer's \"real\" reason for not killing Caster.\\n\\n\r\nLater on, Archer tells Shirou that his first real reason for not defeating Caster is that she would simply escape, and the only way to defeat a Caster is by defeating the master. But this makes absolutely no sense because even if Caster has many tricks up her sleeves, that doesn't mean that she is immortal and can't be defeated. Plus, the fact that she was already injured meant that it would be simple to finish her off.\\n\\n\r\nThen, Archer claims that his second real reason for not defeating Caster is that he wanted Caster to continue draining mana from the people in the city and eventually be strong enough to defeat Berserker, who is a stronger adversary. But just a few moments ago, Archer said that the reason he initially wanted to kill off both Saber and Berserker back in episode 3 was because it was before Rin and Shirou entered into an alliance and that Shirou can't expect Archer to think so far in advance. Then how is it that Archer is suddenly now able to think so far in advance and ends up letting Caster go because of this newfound foresight that he initially said he isn't expected to have?\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 12\\n\r\nAgain, Shirou wastes his final Command Spell randomly on the exact same command he wasted his first one. You would think that Shirou, after understanding how Command Spells work, has finally got complete control over when he uses one, but I guess not. Shirou continues to exhibit simultaneously an annoying ignorance of spell usage and miraculous outbursts of projection magic mastery.\\n\\n\r\nShirou becomes really concerned for Saber after she gets taken by Caster, but earlier he was completely willing to sacrifice Saber for Fujimura when he offered his command seals to Caster. Either that or Shirou completely forgot that surrendering his Command Spells would make him lose Saber, but even this is still an unforgivable mistake.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 13\\n\r\nWhen Caster uses the Rule Breaker on Saber back in episode 12, Saber cried out in agonizing pain as the magic burst out from the wound. But when Caster does the same to Archer, there was no hint of pain whatsoever and there was hardly any effect of magic seen. Perhaps it was because Saber was unwilling whereas Archer was willing, but this is insufficient explanation because regardless of consent, getting stabbed by a dagger should certainly always be painful.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 17\\n\r\nArcher states that after fending off Lancer's Gae Bolg, his right arm was rendered useless.\\n\r\nBut just several moments after that battle, Archer is able to use wield his sword again with his right hand and even stab Kuzuki with it. How did his right arm recover so quickly without any external mana reserves?\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 22\\n\r\nThroughout the anime, I find Rin's german incantations annoying since she doesn't pronounce them properly. I can overlook her short attack spells like Gandr, but when she's doing such a complicated magic circuit transferring process, I would rather it have been done in plain Japanese. Since I do understand German to a degree, it would suffice to say that her first line of the incantation literally meant, \"Give the migratory bird drinking water that comes from a long away.\" The rest of the incantation included a bird cage, spinning rainbows, weather conditions, and a friend who goes away on a long trip. Basically, the words make no sense whatsoever in relation to the spell at hand. Rin summoned Archer in Japanese, so I don't see why the writers have to insist on her using German for these long incantations that are bound to be pronounced badly anyway.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 24\\n\r\nShirou uses Rho Aias to fend off Gilgamesh's attacks several times during their battle. But the problem is that Shirou never saw Archer using Rho Aias because he was with Rin fighting Caster and Kuzuki at that time in the church. Since Shirou never saw Rho Aias, he shouldn't have been able to materialize it.",

            "content": "\"If you fight for ideals, you will only be able to save ideals\" - Archer\r\nPreface: \r\nBriefly, the Holy Grail War is a proxy war waged between seven masters,  and their summoned \"servants\"- or the spirit of a fallen legendary hero from ages past- over the Holy Grail, an omnipotent wish granting device. The last master/servant duo standing is the winner, as declared by the Holy Church. The pair is then granted a wish: that which they desire most. This is the setting for the Fate universe: an eternal struggle for power and the Holy Grail.\r\nArtwork and Animation: 10\r\nAs with Fate Zero (FZ) before it,Unlimited Blade Works (UBW) is an incredible visual feast. Vibrant, dynamic lighting and shadow play along with particle effects rendered by the 3D beautifully. Swirling lights, darks, and brilliant displays of energy color the typically dark palettes of the show. Much of it takes place at night, and the lighting and brightness of the clashes play off the darkness and shadows. The scenery and backdrops have a tremendous level of detail and idle animation, and the quality of the character models and action never drops in the slightest throughout the entire 27 episode series. In fact- as the action rises in the plot, so does the furious attention to detail in the fight choreography. \\n\\n\r\nI've maintained that Sword Art Online contains the best traditional animation, especially in its very quick-cut, fluid, and breathtaking action. However, UBW is on par with that- especially towards the end, with Shiro, Archer, and Gilgamesh's various brawls. The magical animation is some of the most flowing and crisp, however. The magic runes and swirls of power from the various spells are extremely fluid; and the various reds, purples, and golds that make up the flow of energy lend an arcane and airy, yet powerful feel to the action. \\n\\n\r\nThey don't call it Unlimited Budget Works for no reason. This is as good as it gets.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 9.5\\n\\n\r\nIndustry veteran Yoshikazu Iwanami, who's done everything from Garzey's Wing to Sword Art to Jojo directed the sound in UBW, which was honestly one of the weaker elements of the show, especially compared to the fantastically dark, mystical atmospheric OST Kenji Kawai composed for Fate Stay Night (2006). The background and insert music itself was utterly forgettable, and rarely lent any feeling to the atmosphere. Moments of tension and action were scored, but it never really left an impression on me- mostly I didn't even realize it was there. This is not a bad thing however- not noticing the music. At least it wasn't actively interfering with my ability to hear characters speaking or setting up the wrong kind of mood for certain scenes. It does its job, just quietly... in the background.\\n\\n\r\nA very large positive for the musical front though, was the 2nd opening song, \"Brave Shine\" by Aimer. A truly anthemic, powerful song that definitely got me excited to hear, if not watch the show to follow. I don't think I'm going to get tired of it, nor get it out of my head any time soon- and that's how it should be.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nWhere Deen's Fate Stay Night 2006 faltered in fleshing out its characters in lieu of making a sort of Frankenstein's monster out of the three different Visual Novel routes; ufotable wrings out every bit of characterization from the characters in the actual route they were adapting. This route of the Visual Novel (VN) features Rin Tohsaka and her relationship to everyone's favorite ninnyboy shonen protag Shiro, as the focal point of the show. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of people don't care for the tsundere kind of character, and while I dislike labeling characters by trope as their defining characteristic, Rin certainly fits the bill, but in a believable way. As a person, Rin is not the most complex of girls, being that she's one of the best and brightest (as well as good looking) students in the school. She differs from most of these \"perfect human being\" characters in that she's pretty much a misanthrope. Rin dislikes nearly everyone she comes into contact with, generally either because they hit on her, or are jealous of her abilities. \\n\\n\r\nWhere she develops though, is through her forced interactions with Shiro and the other masters in the grail war. Initially, it's much the same as in FSN- she's cold, calculating, but for some irritating reason she can't explain, has a soft spot for one Shiro Emiya. After she saves his life and learns he's a master, they form an uneasy alliance to help see the fight to the end. In UBW, the focus is on the formation of their relationship and mutual understanding after a series of traumatic events in the grail war. We see her character transform from this annoying trope of a selfish bratty girl into a multifaceted, hard headed woman with goals that she ACTS UPON- and that was what really set this route apart from the old Stay Night. I personally found Rin to be one of the best parts of the show, especially since she wasn't sidelined as a main character to form a sort of harem, and she given a real voice of her own, and made choices that were integral to the plot.  She makes a great leading character without being devolved into waifu-bait or a walking fanservice machine, and grows into a character with enough depth to be interesting, and with believable motives and goals (especially ones that don't include unexplained romantic attachments to the closest person with a Y chromosome). In fact, aside from the first class visuals of the show, this one is relatively fanservice free- a rarity among anime that take place in a high school and involve magic. \\n\\n\r\nWe see not only the emergence and repeated utterances of some nebulously intangible goals (a staple of shonen) that Rin (and the other characters have) but see them take a real form, and taken through to the end (atypical of shonen). The characters go through complete arcs, with a defined beginning, middle, and conclusion. They had actual depth instead of just breadth- particularly in the mentality and idealistic natures of Shiro and Rin. Without delving into spoilers- there's a lot of inner turmoil and ideological clashing that occurs in the show. While it may come off preachy to some, it's much in the same vein as Fate Zero, though focused on the individual level rather than Zero's societal level, and much less of a philosophical approach to the conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest character growth comes from Shiro Emiya, however. It's not my place to spoil this for anyone who would see the show, but I'll leave this quote, the self conflict within Shiro that is repeatedly brought up and attacked throughout the show: \\n\r\n\"You're driven by this ridiculous obsession with self sacrifice, blind to your own arrogance. But in the end, you're a fraud, and your hypocrisy can't save anyone. How could you, when you never knew who you should save to begin with? Look, this is the result. You could never be a savior. You never had anything to save. You became the embodiment of justice, and justice can be CRUEL!\" \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to the story section, which, as a sequel to Fate Zero, works at a fantastic level. I'm a rather unorthodox watcher of the Fate franchise in that I started with Zero, saw FSN, and now UBW. With this experience, I'm able to put Zero and FSN in a different perspective from most, and am not clouded by a surface judgement that because Stay Night is old and not done by ufotable, then it must be crap. This is simply not the case. Stay Night has its merits, but on the whole UBW is undoubtedly better on nearly all counts. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot here took a lot of turns and twists that as a first time, ignorant viewer, really took me by surprise. This show definitely did not pull any punches, and definitely has the power to shock, especially given that I assumed it would follow the conventions set by Fate Stay Night before it- being very shonen and afraid to kill off any characters. Since Stay Night and Unimited Blade Works both came from the original VN, I expected the writing to be on about the same level, and for the scenarios to play out similarly, but I was very wrong. Perhaps the liberties taken by Deen transformed the original into something it wasn't supposed to be, but UBW stays very true to the source material in adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nThis show also addressed all of the questions I had about various plot elements of Fate Stay Night as well- namely addressing the familial issues between Shiro and Illyasviel, Rin and Sakura, and Arthuria explaining to Shiro what happened 10 years prior, during the events of FZ and how he came to be Kiritsugu's son. These were all handled very well, even though two of the three aren't even necessarily related to this route, they were discussed in enough detail to have advanced each of those subplots to an acceptable level, where FSN 2006 had just glossed over them. \\n\\n\r\nThe reason I give the story a 7/10 though, mostly lies in the antagonist and secondary antagonist. It's not a spoiler to say that Kirei Kotomine is not a protagonist in this series, however, his role in the plot is so relegated to the sidelines that he might as well have not even been in the show- which is a shame, as he's one of the most fleshed out and awesomely self-conflicted characters in the Fate franchise. His misuse in the show was disappointing, but at least his character was not ruined. \\n\\n\r\nThe second major miscue was the primary antagonist. The adversary in UBW's goals are a laughable Machiavellian evil, and come off as nearly a joke. When I heard for the first time what this character's purpose was, I laughed out loud. Where Zero was more about ideology, ethics, and philosophical musings and the actual Holy Grail war itself was merely a backdrop onto which these ideas were cast, in UBW it's the Holy Grail which takes more of the spotlight... and is a weaker plot for it. The first 3/4 of the show was wholly engulfed in the character's ideals clashing , which led to a pair of great episodes where two characters are consumed in an epic struggle of 'self doubt/impossible idealism' VS self actualization and the power of a dream', similarly to Kiritsugu and Saber in Fate Zero. \\n\\n\r\nI think many may have been bored by how 'talky' a series of episodes in the second half were, I think it strengthened the plot by attacking the issues the characters had been building up for half the show head on. The resolution to this was nothing short of quotable, and definitely a high point in the series, where a certain lawful stupid, headstrong, self sacrificing walking shonen trope of character actually has to come to terms with their insufferable ideals, and manages to come out a stronger and maybe even empathetic character. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 10, 9 \\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade Works finally captured the real feeling of Fate for me. This is how Fate was supposed to look, sound, and feel- victorious highs, crushing lows, and some absolute shockers of surprises. Any show that gets me to react in as many different (and strong) ways as this one did has certainly left its mark on me- one I won't be forgetting anytime soon. While I certainly don't think that Fate UBW is a perfect show by any means, it sits high among the most enjoyable and addictive watches I've had the pleasure of experiencing. \\n\\n\r\nThe turns in the plot strongly differed from my expectations, and the expectations I had were completely and totally subverted by the time I got to the end. I laughed, I shouted, I even felt a tear welling up in a couple of softer moments. I can say that without a doubt, this was one of the most entertaining anime I've seen, period. \\n\r\nWhile there were a couple of moments that I thought Fate Stay Night 2006 tackled better, one I can attribute to being a route (of the VN) difference, where Saber was the focus of the plot, and not Rin, but the other was a moment involving Kirei I wish they had also brought over. \\n\\n\r\nOne moment from the very last episode that nearly ended in my death from laughter was where Shiro and Rin lampshade the moments from the beginning of the routes (or basically the entirety of Heaven's Feel) called \"Cooking with Sakura\". BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO COOK BREAKFAST FOR ME\\n\r\nNO IT'S OKAY REALLY\\n\r\nNO BUT YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO \\n\r\nI DON'T MIND!\\n\r\nFor those who were like me, and real sick of that crap... it's a beautiful moment when ufotable can make fun of the source material.\\n\\n\r\nAnother element to the plot I thought was very well handled was the romance. Gone are the harem-esque days of Fate Stay Night 06, (this is lampshaded too, with Taiga saying \"What, are you going to have a bunch of girls living with you now?\") and in with a show that actually treats its characters with some grace and feeling. The romance doesn't just \"happen\" as in so many shonens, where the main female characters fawn over anything with a Y chromosome, it actually builds as a result of spending time with each other and sharing mutual experiences that bring them closer together. The only thing I would have liked to have seen was a more affectionate sort of portrayal of the relationship, but alas, that's something that's not in line with Japanese culture. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Tl;Dr section (I see you skipping to this, losers)\\n\\n\r\n+ Great character development (Shiro especially, but Rin too)\\n\r\n+ Some of the absolute best animation out there\\n\r\n+ Exciting, addictive watch with unexpected twists and turns\\n\r\n+ Dub is fantastic \\n\\n\r\n+/- Forgettable music, but not bad (Brave Shine is awesome)\\n\r\n+/- Dio Brando level bad motives for the villain\\n\\n\\n\r\nFSN 2006 vs UBW\\n\\n\r\nFSN did it better:\\n\r\n-Music\\n\r\n-Atmosphere\\n\r\n-Kirei\\n\\n\r\nUBW did it WAY better: \\n\r\n-Animation\\n\r\n-Characterization, no harems\\n\r\n-Faithfulness to the source\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"I found those whose happiness was destined to die and bestowed that honor on them instead. That's what a hero does. I killed one to save many, just as any hero of justice would do.\" - Archer",

            "content": "Story - 7/10\r\nThe story works well as a conclusion to the series. In fact, there is a focus in concluding the conflicts and mysteries left from the first season, like the servants motives and ambitions, which is , at some point, well done, but lets talk about it in the Characters section, because their development is the most positive aspect of the story.\r\nAlso, the story brings some debate about themes like idealism, perseverance and regret, most of them aboarded in the Archer/Shirou conflict, which is the best part of the anime.\r\nNevertheless, in my opinion, the main plot fails in becoming a serious and deep story,what was well done in Fate/Zero. I think it happened mostly because the Grail and its importance was put aside until the very end.\\n\r\nThat being, the story works well to keep viewers interested in watching the series, in part because of its plot twists, but does not avoid becoming a bit ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nArt -  9/10\\n\r\nWhat to say about one of the most positive points since season one besides it keeps the stardarts of the Fate series, which is, actually, a good thing.\\n\r\nThe art not differs from the previous ones and it helps keeping you in that universe.\\n\r\nThe animation is great as always. It is very well coloured and fluid, which makes it very easy and pleasant to watch the anime. Also the fight scenes, one of the best things of season one, continue as awesome as they were.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nAs the animation, the soundtrack does not go far from the stardart of the fate series, which also helps keeping you in that universe. Also it helps creating the scenary of the epic and sentimental/romantic moments of the series.\\n\r\nAbout the dubbing, I can say I am very pleased about it. The dubbers know exactly how to empersonater their characters, for example the arrogance of Gilgamesh and the prepotence and anger of Archer are very perseptive through their voices.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8/10\\n\r\nThe most positive aspect of the second season, that differed it from the first one, is the development of the characters. Most of the remaining servants and masters had their backgrounds explored, some well done and others not that much. We become able to understand a lot about Illyia and her relation with Berserker and about Assassin's lack of purpose. One development that I think it was not well done was Caster's. In some points, attempting to make her seem more than just a villain results in contraditions. Yet, we come to understand why she cares so much about Kuzuki.\\n\r\nAbout the two protagonist, their relation evolved well, though sometimes it seemed a little bit too forced, due to not enough previous development. Their interations are, nevertheless, one the most pleasant things to accompany in the anime, in my opinion.\\n\r\nNow to the main point: Archer. In the second season he is the best characters by far. We come to understand who he is, what his reasons are, what pain and regrets he has gone through in order to lose and to curse his ideal and in order to become the character we were presented, everything very well done, resulting in an incredible and beliavable backgroud story, which culminates in the best sequence of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nThe combination of smooth animation and diverse character development makes it entairtaining to watch this anime. Also, in my opinion, the chemistry between Rin and Shirou and his rivalry with Archer and with Gilgamesh are very pleasant and exciting to accompany. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\nThis series is not the best one in the Fate series. Yet, it maintainsmost of its good aspects, and where it lacks deepeth, it has fun and enjoyability. That said, I think it s a very good anime to watch, although not coming to be a unique one.",

            "content": "My original review: http://pokemaster12.blogspot.com/2015/07/fatestay-night-unlimited-bladeworks.html\r\nDo you want action? Do you want awesome? Do you want, well, I can't think of anything else, but! If you're looking for an exciting anime that delves into the psyche of someone who dreams of becoming a hero, than look no further. Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works is a remake of the Fate/Stay Night UBW movie made by a company several years back. That movie, by the way? Yeah, it sucked. This anime series? Awesome.\r\nThe basic story behind Fate/Stay Night is this: Fuyuki City\u2014a city surrounded by the ocean and the mountains becomes the setting for an age-old ritual. To realizethe mythical Holy Grail, which is said to grant any wish from its possessor, seven masters are given seven heroic spirits chosen by the Grail. These heroic spirits or servants are: Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Assassin, Berserker.\\n\\n\r\nEach master will enter into a contract with their assigned servants and battle the other masters and servants to the death until only one pair remains...\\n\\n\r\nThis is the \"Holy Grail War.\"\\n\\n\r\nThis story focuses primarily on the heroine Rin Toosaka. After her father's death, Rin enters the Holy Grail War as the sole heir to the prestigious Toosaka Household, with her servant Archer. But, she soon finds out that Shirou Emiya, a boy from her high school has gotten himself involved in the battles and unexpectedly saves him when he is fatally injured.\\n\\n\r\nBefore long, Rin sets out to strike down the conspiracies surrounding the Holy Grail War along with Shirou and his summoned servant Saber. And so, the story begins to explore the truth behind Shirou\u2019s powers and the nature behind his unyielding will to become a \"hero.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing you should know about this anime is that the animation is beautiful. Seriously, their fight scenes are absolutely glorious, somehow managing to capture the intensity of a high-level battle between Heroic Spirits, the spirits of former heroes told in legend, perfectly. Fast-paced, filled with action, and with unimaginably smooth action sequences, on a purely animated standpoint, Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works takes home the gold medal.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there is more to this anime beyond its actions scenes, like, you know, a really pretty blond woman who can wield a sword with the best of them. No, seriously. There's this cute little blond woman who fights like a freaking demon. She's amazing. And this actually brings one of this stories strongest points home: kickass female characters. I know a lot of people, women especially, want to see badass females. You don't have to look much further than here. The two main female characters, Saber and Rin Tohsaka, are quite possibly some of the strongest women to have come out of anime in the past five or so years. They may not have the gritty personality of someone like Revy from Black Lagoon, but that certainly doesn't make them any less strong.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterizations in this anime are actually quite well-done. While some characters are based off an archetype (Rin Tohsaka is a classic example of a tsundere), they still feel more fleshed out than what you see in a lot of anime these days. They're not just one-dimensional personalities with a \"tsun-tsun\" and \"dere-dere\" switch that can be flipped at the drop of a hat. The main character, especially, one Shiro Emiya is actually one of the few male protagonists to come out recently that I really like. Sure, he's got some seriously screwed up priorities, but his incredibly flawed existence makes him all the more likable. Although I really do feel bad for Rin. I mean, having to put up with someone like Emiya must be hard work.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one thing I did not like about this anime, it was this scene. This god-awful piece of crap scene, where Ufotable omitted the fact that Shiro and Rin had sex and instead mucked up the entire magic system in some misguided attempt to make this more kid friendly. Transfer a magic crest?! Seriously?! You might as well turn Shiro Emiya into Shiro Tohsaka since he's pretty much the head of the Tohsaka house now that you've given Rin's magic crest to him. The magic crest is the symbol of a mage family's power, the culmination of generations of research. You don't just \"transfer\" something like that! All you people needed to do to make this kid friend was a \"fade out\" and a \"fade in\" scene. That's it! It would have freaking worked, but no! You had to go and screw yourselves in the butt with a crowbar because, lord forbid, we follow the canon. Guess what geniuses, this anime is based off an eroge! It was going to have sex in it, and if you don't like that, then maybe you shouldn't have bothered producing it!\\n\\n\r\n... Okay, I feel better now. Man, that was liberating.\\n\\n\r\nSo, mucking up the magic system to accommodate Ufotable's \"no sex\" policy aside, this is still a really good anime, and I would recommend it to everyone who wants a good action series with some excellent character development. I know some people who really didn't like this anime, stating that it didn't capture the grandeur of the prequel, but I always felt that Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night UBW were too different beasts dealing with two different issues. Fate/Zero was a Greek Tragedy, dealing with adult characters who are all really F**ked up people. UBW is more of a shounen action than anything else. You simply can't compare one with the other.",

            "content": "As someone who first watched Fate/Zero and absolutely loved it, I had high expectations coming into Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works. I could not have been more disappointed. \r\nThis review will have minor spoilers for both Fate/stay night and Fate/Zero, but nothing too specific.\r\nTL;DR: Having Shirou as the sole main character ruins what could have been a great battle royal anime.\r\nSound and Art - 10/10\r\nThis anime isn\u2019t called Unlimited Budget Works for nothing. \r\nStory and Characters - 4/10\r\nThis is where everything falls apart, and it's all thanks to Shirou. Not necessarily because Shirou is a bad character, although he is, my problem more is thathe is the only character the anime gives any main focus to. The part I loved in Fate/Zero above all else was how most of the Master/Servant pairings felt like they could be the main character of the anime. Each had their own motivations for participating in the war, and the anime\u2019s focus was spread across all the characters so the audience can connect with these characters throughout the show. Only three of the participants were really evil characters in the beginning, that being Ryuunosuke/Caster and Kayneth. Due to this, all the characters have equally legitimate reasons for winning the war, and the anime doesn\u2019t present one pair winning as being more important or likely than another. \\n\\n\r\nF/SN meanwhile primarily shows the events of the war through Shirou\u2019s perspective.  We don\u2019t spend any time with the other pairings unless they are involved in some way with Shirou, mostly just in attacking him. All the other pairings besides Rin/Archer are presented as antagonists towards Shirou. None of them are presented as having any motivations to participate in the Holy Grail War. Shinji motivation would seem to be to gain more respect, but he is presented as a cartoonishly evil jerk early on and he takes far too much joy in the violence of the war to be taken seriously. Caster\u2019s Master literally just happens to find a masterless Caster and then gets involved. Caster\u2019s wish seems to be the happiness that she didn\u2019t receive in her past life, however due to her villainous actions of preying on the innocent civilians of the city she is hardly a sympathetic character. Illya seems to only want revenge on Shirou and has no interest in the war besides that. Kirei first orders Lancer to not fight at full strength and then to literally kill himself, so he obviously is not taking the war as seriously as one should. The pairings are generally given a bit of character and backstory right before they die, however this is mostly added for momentary feels. None of it makes you care about the characters because it is too late to route for them. This leads to all the other characters feeling more like roadblocks in Shirou\u2019s inevitable victory rather than real players in the battle royal of the Holy Grail War. \\n\\n\r\nSo sure, most of the characters end up becoming side characters, but even then that would be alright if Shirou was a good character. Unfortunately he is not. He is your typical hot-headed, speaks his mind, harem getting shounen protagonist who rushes into danger and faces significantly stronger and better prepared enemies and comes out alright cause of plot armor. I am quite aware he is a much more interesting character in the visual novel, but this is how he comes off in the anime. As a mage with no experience and no natural talent he is able to match a trained assassin, a version of himself from the future that is superior in every way, and the strongest servant quite possibly ever. He should have died in all of these.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some other characters as well of course. Rin is my waifu. Archer is cool but I wish he had gotten a full episode backstory like Kiritsugu had, as his ideals are always presented as negative when compared to Shirou's and it would have been nice to get his own perspective. Saber does basically nothing of note this time and is essentially useless, which is such a waste of a great character I loved from F/Z. Kirei does basically nothing of note this time and is essentially useless, which is such a waste of a great character I loved from F/Z. Gilgamesh ends up being just your generic bad guy who wants to kill everyone for a poorly motivated reason as opposed to the arrogant yet respectable king he was in the previous war, which is such a waste of a great character I loved from F/Z.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5/10\\n\r\nFate/stay night UBW was one of my greatest disappointments in my anime watching life. Not only because the story and characters were lackluster, but because how it threw out all the elements I loved about it\u2019s prequel. The Holy Grail War is not taken seriously at all and I honestly couldn\u2019t have cared less about any of the characters (besides my waifu ofc). The amazing production value is the only thing keeping this anime from falling below a 5. \\n",

            "content": "With awkward silence of Shirou\u2019s inability to comprehend the words of others does the Nausverse return to our screens. Welcome back to the continuation of the story we shrugged off the harrowing inconsistencies to, with gritted teeth murmuring \u201cat least the action is good.\u201d\r\nThis time the story opens with that continued intrigue of Archer, of his hidden ideals and subtle character development, and the subplot of Caster\u2019s backstory is fleshed out nicely. Unfortunately, the pitiful romance between Rin and Shirou is returning, with her tsundere tricks all coming to play while Shirou continues to be the biggest idiot on screen. On the bright side, atleast he says what he\u2019s thinking, even if that barely constitutes to rational, well-built thought that\u2019s more often than not showing his chauvinism. At least more of the cast are calling him an idiot, instead of just Archer.  When Gilgamesh says \u201cyou\u2019re arrogance is breathtaking\u201d I almost laughed at the self-awareness.\\n\\n\r\nBefore long more alliances are attempting to be made and, returning from Zero and cameos of last season, Gilgamesh finally strikes in what would be an epic battle against Berserker and his master, Ilya. I say \u2018would be an epic battle\u2019, because three words came to mind throughout the entire episode: \u201cType-Zero plz nerf.\u201d It actually makes it hilarious that at one point Rin wanted to summon Saber because she was \u201cthe most powerful,\u201d when actually she\u2019s failed to do anything except retreat from other servants, watch others get killed and keep Shirou alive once or twice - though, with his near-suicidal tendencies I\u2019d wager that\u2019s bordering on superhero ability. She should be happy she ended up with Archer, because he\u2019s certainly a lot more interesting than anything else in this show.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, I really must commend the poeticism that Archer\u2019s character allows. The deconstruction of his character provides fantastic discussion for the show to take and a brilliant way to test our hero\u2019s idiotic ideals; it gives the kind of fertile writing ground that made The Joker such a brilliant villain. The dialogue is a bit wonky in constantly attempting to allow the universe to handle such a twist, but Archer does provide one of the better monologues of the series. Perhaps if it allowed the audience to suspend their disbelief a bit more, this monologue could have been as strong as Fate/Zero\u2019s finale.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this talk of ideals could have made for an interesting, albeit late development of Shirou, and learning to make choices to actually save others rather than throwing himself towards death thinking that gives some sort of purpose. Unfortunately, Shirou isn\u2019t Batman, and has the inability to listen to anything anybody says. He\u2019s probably too busy staring at Rin\u2019s thigh-highs.\\n\\n\r\nThese things could be redeemed by the story, or by a good story, but Unlimited Blade Works writes itself into a corner as it tries to come to a conclusion. It makes excuses to save its characters, delaying battles for little reason, and death is not a constant that this universe\u2019s rules abide. It jumps from point to point because the plot demands it, without reason behind why. For all the hype it builds, as soon as you take a step back, you realise the weakness of the narrative, the characters, the dialogue, the symbolism, all relying on top notch action, animation, brilliant music and\u2026 fanservice\u2026 to carry it. Sounds familiar? Yes, it\u2019s a summer action-blockbuster, attempting to be more. Both series\u2019 constitute a summer block-buster spread out across 25 episodes (24 if you exclude the pointless epilogue), when it really should have been 2-3 2 hours movies and would have lost nothing significant in that trimming.\\n\\n\r\nDespite exploring Archer\u2019s backstory in reflection to Shirou\u2019s own story, despite fighting in a \u201cwar\u201d that put him moments away from death constantly, despite all these betrayals and alliances, Shirou\u2019s learned nothing, about himself or his ideals. The only difference between Shirou at the start and at the end is that he\u2019s slightly better at magic and swordfighting. \\n\\n\r\nBut at least the action was good.",

            "content": "I did my best to not put in spoilers.\r\nThe Fate series has been a very special series to me. After watching the original 2006 and 2010 DEEN adaptions, I was disappointed, at the least. However, I watched Fate/Zero and loved it. Now we are here at the Fate/Stay Night UBW. And I also loved it.\r\nOriginally a visual novel, Fate/Stay Night has a critical problem when it becomes an anime - all the details. To me, the novel will always surpass the TV. However, Ufotable was accurately able to portray a great amount of detail from the novel, making it a fairly loyal adaptation. Of course,many will say that there was a problem with the pacing, others saying monologues were disregarded. It would be hard to include all these monologues in an anime without boring the audience. They put in a fair amount, allowing the story to progress, and provide overall enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nMany people came in to the series expecting a Fate/Zero sequel. While there are moments in the series that require Fate/Zero in knowledge, it is important to mention that UBW was not meant to be a sequel to Zero. Therefore, it is not the best idea to compare Fate/Stay Night to Zero. Zero was a light novel coming after the Visual Novel meant to explain the events of Fate/Stay Night. As a light novel, it was much easier to incorporate the version into an anime. When making a decision about this, I did not compare my thoughts to zero because even though they are related, they are almost separated works.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is a kind of a middle ground. Out of Fate, UBW, and Heaven's Feel, UBW is my favorite because of its clash of ideals rather than a gigantic battle. While the outline of the story is the Holy Grail War, a gigantic magical war between Servants, it delves into the protagonist's subconscious often, focusing on Shirou's dream of a \"hero of justice.\" If it were simply just a straightforward war, the anime would, in my opinion be seen as mundane and tiring. The clash of ideals and opinions, combined with slight romance and innocence, makes to be a great story. It will never reach the VN's full detailed complex, but for an anime, it's very detailed.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound is a very interesting piece. This is when I will compare to Zero a little bit. In Zero, the compositions generally were powerful, moving pieces. UBW doesn't have that necessarily. The music is rarely put on high importance. However, I think in comparison with the anime itself, it is a perfect combination. The music does not overshadow the plot at all, at times supporting the actions with a graceful melody. I do agree that Zero's music was a bit more \"heart-clenching and pulling\" but I think UBW does great in the regard to the music. If you listen to some of the soundtrack online you can see that it's not flamboyant, but a very well-composed piece that's enjoyable to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nNow, while this is an action anime, the characters usually in Fate take the spotlight. Honestly, in my opinion, Shirou himself was written a bit more mundane than the novel. I think it's because he's the most affected by the adaptation. Since the novel is written in his point of view, Shirou loses a lot of his monologues and makes him a bit annoying. However, I don't think he is an unlikeable character. I still enjoy him to a high extent. A person can truly see Shirou's conflicts and make it face inward. I still enjoy the struggle of Shirou's ideals. Now, for the the girls. The heroine of Fate, Saber, takes a backseat in the UBW adaptation (on purpose, because she isn't the main heroine unless its the Fate route). As a result, she becomes a polite, quiet, young lady. She however, becomes a very likable character, because of her battle intuition, her loyalty and kindness. It's no wonder people like her most. Then the main heroine of UBW, Rin. Rin is a fun character. She really is. She is a perfect student on the outside, but on the inside she has her own flaws. She is the combination of a perfect human being with a bit of flaws. However, she does not remain idle, like a damsel in distress (not all the time at least). She fights Servants as well as maintains a high mage threat through the story. Then the male servants. Lancer is a great guy. Honorable, modern personality, you enjoy him in the story completely. However, what makes Lancer fun is he remains himself through the entire plot. He has a pride of a hero, is truthfully kind, kind of cocky but fun. Then Archer comes into play. Archer is personally my favorite character ever, so its hard for me to portray without a bit of bias. His personality is complex, his actions are perplexing. However, he remains a character UBW enjoys thoroughly. Like Shirou, Archer loses some important monologues, however his remaining speeches are very thought-provoking and essential for Shirou. His heart is white, but conflicting with the darkness around him. While Archer on the outside is very much a badass, on the inside you can see he's a kind person. If you're wondering, Saber and Archer are consistently the top of Fate's character polls for male and female, and I totally comply with that idea. \\n\\n\r\nNow the art. Well, I'm pretty sure if you're watching the show, you know how the art is. It's on another level, truly making the title, \"Unlimited Budget Works\" make sense. The characters are drawn elegantly and the fight scenes are beautiful and enticing. The art alone puts the anime on a different level. I won't put much detail into this because it's unnecessary, but lots of money produced results. The fight scenes are short, but captivating, while magic scenes are beautiful and, forgive the irony, magical. \\n\\n\r\nI think it's very hard not to enjoy this anime. If you are a VN reader, like me, or a very observant anime watcher, you can see UBW has flaws. Usually its mainly because its hard to adapt, the story is cut short a few times and character development shortens. However, the amount they gave is still astounding. It's fully an enjoyable tv show, in my opinion a perfect anime, while a very good adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is, I can't wait for Heaven's Feel. Many people also want the Fate route and Hollow Ataraxia to be adapted, which I believe would be fun entertainment as well. I really want a sequel to Hollow Ataraxia (come on Type-Moon, please) or another OVA like Carnival Phantasm to see more of the characters. You can truly get attached to so many. I truly hold the fate series to my heart, and I hope this review can help someone later on.\\n\\n\r\nThank you.",

            "content": "This review is mostly for the second season with some Fate/Zero comparisons and general view of this whole series \r\nIf I have to sum up this adaptation of Ufotable then it would be ''A confused adaptation'' Its confused who it tries to mainly caters too is it the VN players ? , Fate/zero watchers ? or New viewers of the franchise ?\r\nFate/Stay Night as a series is one of the most complicated anime adaptations out there to review because how different it is from other Visual Novels let alone other source materials such as manga's and Light Novels .\r\n*Fate/Stay Night as a anime simply wontgive you the full experience of a typical anime that is because no matter what route from the Visual Novel gets adapted it would always feel incomplete unless you saw the other routes because you need the experience of other routes to get that complete experience of the series .Its not all Ufotable's fault because Visual novels are by far are the trickiest to be adapted of any source materials .\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (6)\\n\\n\r\nFate/Stay Night tells their story differently from Fate/Zero (where Fate/zero uses a ''Game of thrones style'' storytelling where it focuses on every characters) Fate/Stay Night  focuses on the Main characters of the series such as Rin,Shirou and Archer . \\n\\n\r\nOn a War setting Fate/Zero simply works better as an anime because you get to see everyone of the masters and what their planning and doing and thus creates much more tension and more interesting since  you can either root for other masters apart from Kiritisugu Emiya such as Waver and Rider  unlike Fate/Stay Night which simply focus mostly on the Main characters especially Archer and Shirou later on . \\n\\n\r\nThe whole Main point of Unlimited Blade Works besides the Holy Grail war is the ideals of Emiya Shirou and his adventures on becoming a hero of justice .  Sounds interesting indeed unfortunately not as quite executed  properly by Ufotable and one of the big reasons is the pacing of the show there are scenes in the show where it feels like something is missing or how much rushed and anti climatic it feels by the end of the episode . \\n\\n\r\nAnd another Major complaint by a lot of viewers is the used of repetition by the characters . The biggest culprit of this is Archer where he has a habit of repeating the exact same lines just told a bit different  especially too Shirou . Episode 19-21 is where Archer repeat a lot of the things the viewers already know which feels dragged and simply boring too a lot of viewers .\\n\\n\r\nAnd I mentioned this series being a ''confused adaptation'' before and its because There are episodes where they explain and info dump too much like everyone who watches this is a new watcher of the series  and there are episodes where they fail to explain on what the hell is going on and expect everyone to be a VN player . There are also episodes  where it has Fate/Zero flash backs and expect everyone to have watched Fate/zero first leaving new viewers confused on who is this guy ? what just happened ?.\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION(9)\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Animation of this series is truly fantastic a lot of the episodes are wall paper worthy . Every episode is  movie quality very few can rival UBW for this category . \\n\\n\r\nThe character art styles on the other hand is a preference .There are many people including me who thinks Rin and Saber looks weird compared to other Fate adaptations when they face side view sometimes they look like a Rhino with that design.  Dont be ashamed to say you mostly watch this show for the animation because animation is  big part of a anime after the story and characters and this show is definitely an eye pleaser .\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND(7)\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a brilliant job with their characters . My favourite one's has to be Archer,Shirou and Gilgamesh every single servant did their voice perfectly you can tell the ego and arrogance of Goldy by the way he talks The suffering,age and sarcastic personality  of Archer by the way he talks and Shirou's VA does a brilliant job on voicing him when he is getting desperate with his shouts .\\n\\n\r\nThe OST on the other hand is average especially for a FATE anime who is famous for having a brilliant OST they released all the fantastic VN OST literally in the final fight (episode 24) I dont understand why they did this since the OST is one of the reason why some important scenes lack tensions or any emotional impact .  The Op Brave shine on the other hand is fantastic and perhaps the best this spring season\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS(6)\\n\\n\r\nBefore I start this I want to remind people that Fate/stay Night develops their characters differently unlike any other animes . If a character is is ignored here or went out without a bang then most likely they are important and are the main characters of the other routes  (for UBW the wasted characters are Rider,Sakura and Kotomine Kirei who are the main cast along with shirou in Heavens Feel.)  *This is not bad writing this is how simply a  Visual novel such as this works** that is why I said early on that you wont get the full experience .\\n\\n\r\nI am going to talk about the Mains and the main antagonist \\n\\n\r\nShirou Emiya :\\n\\n\r\nA Marmite (you either like and admire  him or hate him) he divides the opinions of everyone . A lot of viewers hate him because he is a stubborn and naive young boy who wants to be a Hero of Justice despite knowing what's going to happen to him in the future yet continues to ignore everyone and pursue it . \\n\\n\r\nWhile Some viewers admire him because in a world full of no hoper's and negativity  here is a dreamer who wants the impossible to happen and save everyone a living hypocrite(who admits it ) with a borrowed dream from his late Father . A true Faker \\n\\n\r\nAlso as a VN player I could assure you this plays a big part in Heavens Feel and that route will test Emiya if he really want to become a Hero .\\n\\n\\n\r\nRin:\\n\\n\r\nA smart tsundere girl she is nothing really special on this adaptation she's your average tsundere who laters falls in love with the Main . She maybe a little girl but she is a powerful mage with a lot of knowledge \\n\\n\\n\r\nArcher :\\n\\n\r\nA mysterious Hero with mysterious past he is one of the most popular characters in the whole Type Moon franchise and in this adaptation you could see why there is no other servants  that got focused and developed as much as Archer in this series . Many argues that he is the only great character on this adaptation but can you blame them ? He got more development than Shirou emiya on his own route . Fate/Zero watchers would draw a lot of comparison from the late Kiritsugu Emiya on his Ideals and attitude .\\n\\n\\n\r\nGilgamesh :\\n\\n\r\nHis story has already been established in Fate/Zero and the Fate route so he got little development here just like the VN but Ufotable did provide flash backs for him later on the episodes . He considers everyone around the series inferior to him a mere mongrel he is a incredibly powerful figther that has the ego and arrogance to match it .\\n\\n\\n\r\nSaber:\\n\\n\r\nCompared to the VN she got more developed here with all the flash backs later on but she is a side character here so its understandable that Fate/zero watchers wont like saber here and new viewers thinks she got wasted by Ufotable but simply its not her route (again a problem from being a VN adaptation)\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:(8)\\n\\n\r\nDespite all the flaws I mentioned this is a must watch  anime just dont expect a anime near the level of Fate/Zero . Ufotable could had executed a lot of scenes much better(especially the way they info dump with monologues they are too static like a robot talking just standing there with no movement ) and Paced the series better . Binge watching this anime definitely improves the experience . My expectations were realistic because I know a first person point of view Visual Novel wont translate as good as a anime compared from a Light Novel(fate/zero) adaptation or manga adaptations  \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation coupled with ''Hype scenes Fights '' can make this series very enjoyable to you .\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh lasty the fights are one of my biggest gripes of this series is that most fights got their tensions killed by them talking before and in the middle of the fight . Fair enough if your moving a lot or doing something (like episode 24) but dont just stand there and start info dumping like a robot on a middle of a fight .\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat's all folks I know it was long but hopefully you found my review informative .(Apologize if some of my sentence have random Capitals on it)",

            "content": "Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works (FSN and UBW from now on) is an action-fantasy series adapated from a visual novel by Ufotable and one of the most highly anticipated series from mid-2014 to mid-2015. This review will cover both seasons of the anime. I have not played the VN, so I'm writing the review based on just the anime itself.\r\nP/S. The review is SPOILER FREE. For those of you who dislike reading, skip to the TL;DR section at the end.\r\nSummary\r\nFor those of you who have watched FSN, proceed scrolling down; for those of you who are first timers, FSN is about 7 insufferable masters whowill each summon their own servant through a catalyst, the proceed to participate in a battle royal and eliminate each other to ultimately achieve the grand prize: the holy grail, which will enable those greedy bastards to have their wish granted.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with our main character, Shirou, who has absolutely no clue of the so-called holy grail war, and is forced to participate in it as he unknowingly summons a servant out of thin air (though later in the series it is explained how he achieved such miraculousity - I made that word up). Throughout the story, it tries to explain how Shirou's ideals to be a hero is contradictory with his counterpart, Archer, a servant summoned by Rin.\\n\\n\r\n-Shirou's ideal: I will save every-miserable-body.\\n\\n\r\n-Archer's ideal: There's no point doing that and I'm gonna kill you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the flow of the story was pretty good, easy for people to follow. Minor flaws here and there (especially at the end) could be overlooked. Ufotable did a good job with the pacing, making peaceful parts really serene, and increasing the tension when needed. On the minus side, the story beats around the bush and goes in circles A LOT. It happens when Shirou and Archer debate on their ideals, or when Shirou tries to explain why his flawed ideal is right, which is not the least bit convincing. It just goes on and on and on until at one point you'd just skip some minutes to save time.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, nothing in this series had me at the edge of my seat (except a little bit of Illya's part). No out-of-this-world fight scenes. No what's-going-to-happen-next moments. Nothing had my heart beating faster or gave me the adrenaline rush I was hoping for.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis has got to be the main selling point of the series. I'm sure a hell lot of effort is put into this sector alone. The movement of the characters are fluid, the CGI was God-like, the lighting was divine, the background was detailed, the color was rich, everything was brilliant! I really can't critique something that's near perfect now, can I?\\n\\n\r\nSound and Music: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music was average. Many whom I've asked enjoyed the OP/ED from both seasons. OSTs were also played at the right moment for most parts. Just like the story, nothing really stood out for me. Nothing sounded outstandingly special. It'd be something that I'd listen a couple of times, then just forget about it a few days later.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, on the other hand, was great! I'm glad the retained the original cast of the series. Rin's voice actress, Kana Ueda, had an especially important role to play because this series depended heavily on Rin's involvement, and she handled it pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis can be considered as the weakest part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nLet's begin with ol' Emiya Shirou. Besides becoming physically stronger, his mentality remains at a halt. It's like the extent of his mental development is only 3 episodes, and once it goes to episode 4, it stops. He constantly contemplates on his nonsensical ideals, and uses no logic or whatsoever to try to further improve his flawed, toddler-like thinking. Shirou's just like a stubborn kid trying to break open a container of candy when you can just open the lid. He can come off as dumb, and occasionally spout stuff that makes absolutely no sense. On the plus side, at least there's some development between him and Rin.\\n\\n\r\nRin Tohsaka (some call here \"Toosaka\") was arguably the best developed character in the series. Always on her toes and plotting for the victory, even after that little twist from her servant. There were stagnant moments, but it was necessary to improve her character. There was also too much moe culture inducted into Tutsy's behavior, which I, at most points, think it's completely unnecessary for a series with a supposedly series tone.\\n\\n\r\nArcher's character fluctuates on the graph like Stan Wawrinka's performance on the ATP Tour. For those of you who don't watch tennis, just google image a sin x graph and you'll see what I mean. On certain occasions he plays the good guy, other times he's a complete ass. Just like Shirou, I do not understand the thought process of Archer. I guess some people just don't change no matter how much time we give them - You'll know what I mean when you watch the show. Archer was just poorly written.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there's Saber, who's presence in the entire series is solely dependent on that ONE scene at the end. Absolutely 0 development and no epic fight scenes from her, which is a let down. I understand the story revolves around Rin and Shirou, but the negligance of Saber is like an ungrateful son leavning his dad at an old folks home, running away without a word, then coming back to borrow some money only to disappear again.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, UBW is one of the most highly anticipated series for the past year. but it didn't appeal to me as much as I thought it should. Even so, I did enjoy the series to a certain extent, and boy am I glad to have experienced such a level of animation. In short, DO watch the series, but keep your expectations low, and I'm sure you'll find it somewhat enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10 - a lot of beating around the bush and merry go rounds.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 10/10 - jaw dropping stuff.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Music: 7/10 - something I'd listen to, but nothing spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10 - a lot are not very well written, some just annoy you.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, UBW is one of the most highly anticipated series for the past year. but it didn't appeal to me as much as I thought it should. Even so, I did enjoy the series to a certain extent, and boy am I glad to have experienced such a level of animation. In short, DO watch the series, but keep your expectations low, and I'm sure you'll find it somewhat enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Note: This is my first review, so if there are any disagreements, critiques, good parts, or any form of feedback, please do leave a comment on my profile. Also, please be constructive when commenting/criticizing, as I'd like to use them to further improve my reviews when I write the next one. If you'd do that, then I'd very much appreciate your help!",

            "content": "Ufotable should be renamed to \"UBW\" which stands for \"Unlimited Budget Works\". I mean, look at the animation, the soundtrack, etc. They amassed a large amount of cash cows so they can shit on other studios who made Fate/stay night. *coughdeencough*\r\n(There will be some SPOILERS in my review)\r\nStory: (8/10) (SPOILERS)\r\nI already made a review from the 1st season so this is not going to be extremely long. The story continues from the first season where the Holy Grail War is now at the middle stages. Now here's the reason why I love the story of Fate series. It's not your typical \"Characters fight to thedeath. Whoever survives win the reward\". Yes, they fight to the death to win the Grail but the Grail itself is not what you expected. There's a story behind the Grail, why it grants wishes, who actually created it, and how it actually works. Besides, they destroyed the Grail at the end after they find out what the Grail actually does. Second reason why I love the Fate series is the survival game. I've always been a fan of survival games. That explains why I love the Hunger Games series in general. Third reason is the show explores the horror of the Holy Grail War and the consequences of the war. They even revisit the scenes that took place in the 4th Holy Grail War.\\n\r\n If you watched a Fate series before or just by watching the first season, you already know the story pacing is extremely slow. I usually hate slow story pacing that has a lot of talking because it takes a long time to get anywhere plus the pain of waiting a week just to see what happens next. However, the Fate series is an exception because understanding the story of the show is very important. If you missed one important part of the story then you're going to be confused as hell because they don't explain it back to you again. The Fate series started as a Visual Novel so slow story pacing isn't a surprise. Ever wonder why I hated Log Horizon? I want you to guess.....\\n\r\nThe show also filled the remaining plot holes that FSN 2006 and F/Z had by giving us flashbacks or flashback episodes. Some of the plot holes are; why Ilya decided to become a master, who abandoned Caster and how she was found, and why Gilgamesh was naked in F/Z at the final episode and how he is able to stay in the real world.\\n\r\nThis story review turned out to be longer than I expected it to be.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: (10/10)\\n\r\nIf you read my opener above then you should know why I think Ufotable deserves that name. Just look at the environment, road, floors, building. It's absolutely giving me an eyegasm. Especially when you watch it in HD. The character designs are the same as the first season which I thought is perfect. Using CGi enemies or characters in anime doesn't really fit. It just looks plain horrible. However, The Fate series is an exception. Noticed how I give Fate an exception? Because it works..Because Ufotable designed them well and animated them perfectly. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe battle themes may have been the same as the first season and some of the soundtrack might have sounded decent or mediocre but I'm still giving the sound a biased score of 10. My non-biased score is 8. Why did I give the sound a perfect score you ask? It was because of the Opening called \"Brave Shine\" by Aimer. The Opening soundtrack is the best OP song I have ever heard for this year. I might change my mind if one of the anime this year manages to beat the Brave Shine but I doubt it. The ED is ok but I still prefer the ED soundtrack from the first season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10) (SPOILERS)\\n\r\nLike I said in my first review, the characters here are a lot better compared to their 2006 version but I might as well re-write (with some updated/new parts) my opinions on the characters. Oh, I almost forgot. Unlike the first season which got a poor character development for obvious reasons (Creators want you watch FSN 2006 and F/Zero first). We now got a character development for all our main characters.  Some of them got a flashback episode dedicated to them and it also fills some plot holes that FSN 2006 and F/Z had. Now to review the characters. Shiroe, the main protagonist of the show, pissed the living hell out of me in Fate/stay night(2006) because of how stupid he is and how he takes on the servants just because \"it's for the best\". I literally wanted to punch him in the face every time he makes a stupid decision. In this show however, Shiroe is a lot smarter, not mentally challenged, still makes some few stupid decisions and a lot better compared to FSN(2006). We also find out more about him, his past and why Archer and him are related. Rin, the main character of the show and the show's main focus, is also a lot better than the 2006 version. They made her into a tsundere which is one of the personalities that I love. Basically, she's the same except they added in a tsundere. Saber, one of the main characters of the show and Shiroe's servant, is also a lot better here. I didn't like Saber in the 1st path because she became a \"lovey doveyH\" for Shiroe which did not fit her character. I prefer her cold character with some nice personality. Saber is also a lot cuter here compared to the 2006 version.\\n\r\nArcher which I came to dislike in the first season, now became one of my favourite characters because he had his reasons on why he switched side and why he wanted to kill Shiroe. *hint his flashback hint*. The flashback is pretty sad. He's been doing good deeds all his life and what does he get? Hanged to death.  There is one character in particular that I still absolutely hate and that is Shinji. He's a total asshole in FSN 2006 and he's still a major total asshole in this show. Why did Rin have to save him? Why does Sakura have to look out for him while he was injured?\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed watching Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works as a whole. Enjoyment is a perfect score from me because the show met my expectations in 4 categories(Great Story, Great Animation, Great Soundtrack, and Great Characters). The fighting scenes are lot better than F/Z. The soundtrack is a lot better than F/Z and the characters are also a lot better. I admit, they still have some few flaws but like I said, they're a lot better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9.4/10)\\n\r\nFate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works is one of the best animes of 2014/2015. I personally think that Fate/Zero, in terms of story telling is way better than UBW but UBW is so close to beating F/Z. I recommend you watch this anime if you have read the VN, have watched Fate series before and if you're a fan of anime filled with fighting scenes that are packed with epic battle themes and soundtracks. If you're not a fan of slow story pacing then you'll probably don't like this show. I said probably.\\n\r\nFeel free to use the \"Not Helpful\" button. It touches my dear heart that someone out there actually does not like/hate my review. I could die happy right now. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Great Story\\n\r\n-Ufotable's Perfect Animation\\n\r\n-Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n-Brave Shine is the best opening I've heard this year\\n\r\n-Great Characters\\n\r\n-Great Character Development\\n\r\n-Fighting scenes that surpasses Fate/Zero\\n\r\n-Comedy Scenes between Shiroe and Rin\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Fanservice scene in one of the episodes\\n",

But overall, if you dont know the Fate system and background story enough, you'll be hell confused . This anime should be watched after Playing the Fate route of the Visual Novel, andwatching Fate Zero. (Yes after Zero) Or else you'll really miss out alot of references . Such as we wouldnt know the true power of Ea (we would have thought it was just some powerful sword, not some OP cheat weapon ) , we would have no friggin idea who Saber was (until she fired off Excalibur in Episode 24) and a lack of character development (Rider died so easily, we didnt even know who she was unless you played the VN or watched Fate Route)  Overall , Fate is still a VN style. You really got to watch/ play Fate route first at the very least, or youll feel super disappointed with the UBW anime for their lack of reasons and explaination .\\n\r\nHowever, if you have watched Fate or Fate/Zero , this anime would be full of nostalgia for you, and you may be able to follow the story better  \\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nUfotable has once again done a great job with their animation, which makes me wonder... just how high was their budget. Great art, truly. \\n\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\r\nNice soundtrack to bring and heighten the mood during the fight scenes, relaxing soundtrack during mundane and daily scenes. It loses to Fate/Zero though... \\n\\n\r\nCharacter. 5 if you havent watched Fate, 8 if you have. \\n\r\nQuite abit of backstories . But a lack of character development for a few characters (you need to watch Fate to truly appreciate Unlimited Blade Works)\\n",

            "content": "\"Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else's opinions. Their lives a mimicry. Their passions a quotation.\" --Oscar Wilde\r\nFate/stay night is a popular visual novel from 2004, produced by Type-Moon, who is also notable for the visual novel Tsukihime and the light novel (and subsequently, film series) Kara no Kyoukai. Critically and commercially successful upon launch, it would go on to become a massive franchise, creating fandisk sequels, spin-off video games, prequel novels, and more. It blends a deep, yet mysterious lore with complex and interesting characters which make it shine. Now, roughly ten years after the release of the original VN, andeight years after the previous butchered adaptation by Studio Deen, it's time for Fate/stay night to shine once again in anime form. Do note that while there might be a few, I'll try to do my best to limit comparisons to the original visual novel and the prequel, Fate/Zero, and discuss the show as it was meant to be; its own thing. This will also mostly be a review over the entire show, counting Season 1 as well.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nWithin the secret world of mages, unknown to normal folk who live their ordinary lives, there is a ritual that occurs every so often. The Holy Grail War. A ritual that chooses seven mages to become participants, or \"Masters,\" to do battle against each other. Summoning a powerful familiar called a \"Servant,\" they fight to obtain a mystical object known as the Holy Grail, which will present itself to the victor, and grant one wish to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe primary story follows Shirou Emiya, a morally upstanding young man with very little knowledge of magecraft and aspires to become a champion of justice who can protect those in need, much like a superhero or so. With his Servant, the mysterious Saber, he forms an alliance with classmate and fellow participant Rin Tohsaka, and her Servant, Archer. Together, they will do battle against the other Masters, but things quickly get complicated when ghosts of the previous Holy Grail War return, Shirou's idealistic fantasies are challenged, and the Grail slowly begins to manifest, and not as someone would expect. The story-telling, and eventual transition into a far more character-driven one, is beautiful and makes the experience very engaging.\\n\\n\r\nBecause this happens to be the second route of the visual novel, which requires first-hand knowledge of the first route, the show attempts to make up for a lack of an adaptation for the first route (not counting the 2006 adaptation by Studio Deen) by adding in original scenes explaining and fleshing out things that were better explained in the previous route, including the backstory of a certain character, the motivations of another, and so forth. Fortunately, Studio Ufotable managed to include these original scenes in a coherent way, hopefully able to please both fans of the prequel, Fate/Zero, and those who wish to see a well-made adaptation of the VN.\\n\\n\r\nThough at first, the story starts out as some sort of typical battle royale, what makes this story, like Fate/Zero, unique is that there's a far greater emphasis on character development and focus, though there's quite a good amount of deep lore that one could get themselves lost in as well. These two elements are combined flawlessly, which is what made the original story such a well-beloved franchise in Japan. Do note, however, that if you are coming to this show straight from Fate/Zero, you shouldn't be looking for a strict sequel to it in Unlimited Blade Works, as out of the three routes, UBW is arguably the least connected to F/Z in terms of narrative and characters, focusing mainly on Shirou and his ideals. For a true continuation, or at least, the best it can get, as Fate/stay night came out first, you'll have to wait for the Heavens Feel movie(s) or read the visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say about the art and animation that hasn't been said already? You've likely already heard the memes, like \"Unlimited Budget Works\" and so on. Studio Ufotable makes honestly astonishing work with their budget, as seen with not just Unlimited Blade Works, but also their previous works with Fate/Zero and the Kara no Kyoukai films. The CG rarely looks unnatural, and most of the time when it does, it's done so on purpose. The animation is fluid and stunning, resulting in spectacular, beautiful fight scenes that greatly showcase the characters' strength and speed, and the attention to detail is great. If there's one gripe to be had with the animation, it's that at times, the character models can look a little wonky, resulting in some occasional \"quality\" moments, but those moments hardly bring down the spectacular animation.\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, Unlimited Blade Works is arguably the best-looking anime TV show I ever had the pleasure of viewing, rivaling that of many higher-budget anime films like Howl's Moving Castle and so on. And just imagine how Heavens Feel will look when Ufotable gets a movie budget again.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nProbably the weakest part for me, personally, though the sound department is hardly without its highlights. The voice acting is great, and with the seiyuus having voiced these characters for over ten years, you can bet they're comfortable with the voices. Noriaki Sugiyama and Junichi Suwabe, as Shirou and Archer respectively, are the main highlights. Their voices are phenomenal and are the best of the actors, though Jouji Nakata as Kotomine is also great as ever. The music is kind of a mixed bag. Though much of the OST consists of well-made music that makes one feel like they're watching a high-budget action film, like it is in a sense, though most if not all of the tracks that specifically stand out are remixes of older songs, including Archer's theme, the two remixes of This Illusion, and Emiya.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, there's honestly not much else to say about it. The songs are good, but there aren't a lot in my opinion that seem to specifically stand out, beside the aforementioned modern remixes.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nEasily the highlight of the series. Upon first glance, the protagonist, Shirou Emiya, initially appears to be little more than a generic, idealistic protagonist who wants to protect everyone and be a champion of justice like his adoptive father had once aspired to be. However, he begins to shine when his ideals are challenged, and the show gets kicked into high gear when the psychology of such a person who lives for nothing more than to follow his father's footsteps and achieve his dream is analyzed thoroughly. As such, he undergoes great development, and with some funny dense moments, Shirou is a joy as a protagonist, though that's not to say he's the only good character.\\n\\n\r\nThe primary heroine, Rin Tohsaka, serves as the love interest of Shirou, though she's much more than that. Daughter to one of the late Masters of the previous Holy Grail War, and current heir of one of the three Founding Families of magecraft, she is a talented, intelligent, and powerful young woman. On the surface, she appears to be a typical tsundere-type character, but is more complex than that, sporting additional qualities to flesh her out including an insecurity about herself and the choices she makes, the implied regrets she has over her past (which are spoiled in Fate/Zero and will be elaborated more in the Heavens Feel adaptation), and her more secretly nurturing side. Beside her, there's Saber, Shirou's Servant, a humble yet strong-willed warrior who participated in the previous Holy Grail War, and fights to acquire the Grail to undo her mistakes, living obsessively to achieve a possibly moot goal, similar to Shirou. Viewers coming in from Fate/Zero may be disappointed by her comparatively minimal role here, as she was arguably the primary protagonist alongside Kiritsugu Emiya, which may be understandable, as the sudden transition from a show that's equally story and character-driven into a show that's more character-driven, and much less on Saber, may be jarring, which is why it's best to watch Unlimited Blade Works with a clear and fresh impression, because as stated earlier, it is not a continuation of Fate/Zero, but merely, one possible string of events that happens to occur after it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also Archer, the mysterious Servant of Rin who comes to play quite the important role in UBW. The mystery surrounding him makes him interesting, as well as the choices he makes that affects the other protagonist, and most importantly, his cynical viewpoint of life that clashes heavily with Shirou's idealism, making them great opposites on the spectrum of morality. Aside from him, there are also the fellow Masters and Servants, some who play bigger roles than others, though if I spend the whole review talking about them, I'll never finish, though I will honorably mention Caster, Kuzuki, Ilya, Shinji, and Lancer, as well as the antagonists, the scheming Kirei Kotomine (Once again, wait for HF if you wanted to see him live up to how he was in F/Z!) and the fearsome Gilgamesh, arguably one of the strongest characters in the Type-Moon universe.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nAs a personal fan of the VN, the show was great. It provided just enough service to appeal to old fans, but also appealing to fans of Fate/Zero and first-time viewers as well. The story worked well, the fights were jaw-dropping and phenomenally well done, the characters were fun to watch with their back-and-forth banter, and so on. Though the first season was somewhat slow, due to having to set up the narrative, setting, and themes, the second season manages to use this eventual familiarization and kick things into high gear, providing a great blend of over-the-top action and serious, complex characters.\\n\\n\r\n... Though I imagine most people could have gone without some of the on-and-on exposition at times, though of course, this is lightened up quite a bit come the second season.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of the original visual novel, I'm happy to say that this is a great show for just about all of the crowds, be it fellow VN readers, fans of F/Z, and first-time viewers who want to get into the Fate franchise and believe this might be a good starting point. With a well-crafted, character-driven story that delves into the struggles that comes with being a hero that lives for nothing more than to protect, unrivaled animation in anime shows, splendid voice acting, and unforgettable sequences, Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works is sure to be a pleasure to many. It stands as not only the best series of the seasons, but also, in my opinion, one of the greatest anime shows ever made.",

            "content": "If I were to describe the first season, it'd be \"flawed, but still entertaining.\" The characters regularly acted in ways inconsistent with their established motivations, but you could always at least tell what was going on at a given moment, and the interesting possibilities of its premise, a death game between heroes all with different abilities, backed up by some pretty animation made me keep watching. Even though I didn't consider Season 1 a masterpiece or anything though, Season 2 failed to live up to it.\r\nIts first mistake was the villain. Season 1 kept us guessing who could beat who in what situations, but Season2 introduces a new antagonist (okay, he wasn't new but he didn't matter until now) who just wipes the floor with who we thought was probably the strongest character. As well as I understand it, his powers are, \"can do anything.\" There's just nothing interesting about that. Caster remains an antagonist from last season, and some drama with Archer, but those arcs were resolved through plot, not action, and the plot of this show is just not good.\\n\\n\r\nThe best I can describe the plot of this show is \"stuff happens, because it says so.\" Every single twist in the show felt only partially justified. Unlike the first season, I often didn't quite understand what was exactly happening, and when they tried to explain it through monologues, I struggled to stay interested with all the nonsense. No seriously, the monologues in this show really suck and I hated them. I'd spend time breaking them down and explaining why they're terrible, but I can't even pretend to understand what a lot of them were trying to say, it was that incomprehensible. Oh, and there's time travel in this show, and they do not handle it well.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, there were good moments here and there. There weren't enough, but for a couple of seconds here and there, there'll be a cool bit of animation, or they'll finally shut up and play some sweet music, or Tohsaka will do something cute (yes, I fell for her too, she was annoying at times but stupidly cute at others). If they'd focused more on these and less on convoluted meta nonsense, I'd have walked away much happier, but I guess we don't always get what we want.",

            "content": "I am going to state this as simply as possible. When I review anime, a 7 is a 70% which means the anime was average but nothing special. I noticed most people would say that was worth a 5, or a 50%, but that is an F. If an anime didn't have any obvious flaws other than being nothing special, then I don't think it failed. So please read my reviews with this in mind. This is why most of my ratings seem on the high end. If I enjoyed it enough to finish it, it should be getting a C, not any lower.\r\nI willwrite the exact same review for the other season, as I watched them as together as one.\\n\\n\r\nUnlimited Blade works is a huge improvement upon the original anime adaptation. Everything has been improved upon. Fate Stay/Night is probably one of the best action anime I have ever watched, and is excellent from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nStory(8/10)\\n\r\nThe story is very well written, and even has a bit of a twist I wasn't expecting. All of the pieces come together nicely, and enough mystery is left in everything for it to remain interesting until the very end. The pacing is really fantastic with the slow build to two massive battles. It is hard to say too much more about this, except for how well executed it all was.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10)\\n\r\nI can't make this very long, because I think everyone already knows how gorgeous this anime is. Th character design is solid, the environments are detailed, the world is colorful, and the animation during battles is incredible.  Finally, the special effects are absolutely breathtaking. \\n\\n\r\nSound(8/10)\\n\r\nThis is probably the least noticed gem of the series. The music is so good. It keeps the pacing and the atmosphere just right throughout the anime. Not only that, but on its own, the music is still amazing, I can see myself listening to it outside of the show, and that should say something.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10)\\n\r\nThe characters are all so well developed. They all have deep backstory and unique personality. You will grow to love each of them as the show carries forth. I believe its strongest point is opening it to historical figures. I found myself interested in each hero enough to look them up and read about them, which really added to the history of the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(8/10)\\n\r\nThe show is absolutely gripping. Everything that I have mentioned before makes this a really fun anime to watch. The battles will have you on the edge of your seat, the characters will have you questioning yourself, and the plot will keep you interested.\\n\\n\r\nThis show easily deserves the 9 that I gave it. I usually make this last paragraph recommending it to a certain group or telling them to stay away. However, to be honest, I can't think of anyone who wouldn't enjoy this anime. I will leave you with that.",

Ufotable's follow-up to their blockbuster hit 'Fate Zero' fails to bring repeat success.\r\n-Story-\r\nIf there was one thing 'Unlimited Blade Works' lacked it would be 'momentum'. The story takes its sweet time to get anywhere, and there were a couple times when I would sit through several minutes\r\nof two hostile characters just standing and talking before I had the sickening realization that they weren't going to fight this episode- the exposition and desperate attemptsto be philosophical had used up too much time. For comparison, 'Fate Zero' had it's fair share of plot-extending tricks such as characters deciding not to continue for a fight for vague 'tactical' reasons (a trope that's badly abused here in UBW), but with camera constantly moving between seven different teams it still seemed like something was happening. UBW seems content to follow around Shirou, Rin, Saber, and Archer while they dither about around the school and the other 5 teams are often nowhere to be seen. This\\n\r\nstory is plain and simply slow.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nInconsistent plot devices and philosophical mouthpieces. They act solely in accordance with the needs the story, and often make face-palm worthy decisions because of it. Unfortunately, the worst examples of this come near the end of the story so I don't want to give away big spoilers (let's just say Rin is a repeat offender, and Lancer and Saber have their own moments as well). Or, for a less spoiler-iffic example, the whole reason Shirou survives long at all is because Rin decides to help him despite his being the easiest target and least useful ally out of all the mages in the Holy Grail War because she has a crush on him. Shirou loses any chance at\\n\r\nbeing an inspiring or likable hero because his final realization comes across at fatalistically accepting what might happen rather than adapting his approach in any way. He just seems stubborn, unable to give a clearly articulated reason as to why he would continue to do the exact same thing even when he knows the probable result. So the characters are clear miss as well, uninteresting and dull.\\n\\n\r\n-Art and Sound-\\n\\n\r\nThere's a reason this show had the nickname 'Unlimited Budget Works'- it looks and sounds BEAUTIFUL. I won't waste much time here except to say the animation is jaw-dropping (especially on the rare occasions when characters actually fight) and the sound is excellent. Ufotable's 'Fate' adaptations always seem to have killer OP's and the two in UBW are no exception. \\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nAt first I watched this with high expectations. Then I watched it with macabre fascination, the same way as one would watch a train wreck, as the writing went ever more down the toilet. Don't go into this show expecting anime's magnum opus and you'll probably enjoy this well enough.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\\n\r\nThis anime looks and sounds great, but is a catalog of writing errors. Good for dumb fun.",

            "content": "Fate stay/night unlimited blade works review (both seasons together)\r\n\u2013 SPOILER ALERT: THERE MAY BE SOME SMALLER OR BIGGER SPOILERS IN HERE, ALTOUGH I TRY TO KEEP IT TO A MINIMUM --\r\nFirst of all, this is my first review, so don't be too harsh if my lack of experience shows.\r\nI will be reviewing this anime based on the following elements:\r\n1) Enjoyability (the most important one in my book)\r\n2) Characters/story\r\n3) Art\r\n4) Sound/music\r\nEnjoyability\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much overall. This is off course very subjective, but to me personally the story was very engaging and quite unpredictable. I had not expected a lot of the twists in thestory, for example the servants summoned by the masters turned out to have way more free will and autonomy then I had expected.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights scenes were very tense and enjoyable, and the interactions between the charactes were fun as well. I regularly found myself unable to stop 'before watching one more episode'. For overall enjoyment, I rate this a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters/story\\n\\n\r\nAs said above, the story really kept me interested in the show. Especially during the last five episodes of the second season , I just could not stop watching. At it's core , I believe it is a story about what happens to a single person who tries to always do what is good for others in a world in which most people care more about themselves and maybe their immediate friends and family. We see this in the person of Archer, the servant, who is the future version of the main character and is bitter and depressed about the path this way of live put him on. He is forced to clean up for other people's mess all the time and fight enless battles to this end. Because humans keep making mistakes and keep doing evil things to meet their selfish ends, he never actually comes closer to achieving his ultimate goal of creating a perfect world where everyone can lead a happy life.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around the Holy Grail War, a war which takes place once in a number of decades and involves seven master mages fighting for the holy grail using servants. Each master summons one servant. The master whose servant is the last one too live wins the war and the right to have his or her wish granted by the omnipotent Holy Grail. There are a number of different masters, all of which have their own reasons for wanting to use the power of the Grail. Some wishes are benevolent, some are evil. The fight for the grail provides a lot of exciting moments and fights in the story, and always remains interesting, and as such is a good basis for the plot of the series. This is also true after it is revealed in the second half of the second season that all might not be as it seems when it comes to the Grail and what it really is.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of some of the servants and the six other masters are also explored in depth. They are of different character and all their character types are logical and realistic. Even Gilgamesh, the main villain of the series, is not completely insane, but has his own reasons to want to do the evil deeds he wants to do, which are understandable from his perspective. This makes him an interesting character. The other servants and masters are interesting as well, but not all get as much attention as Emiya, Rin, Saber, Archer, and Gilgamesh because their roles in the story are not that big or they die off early (like Berserker for example). I would want to write more about the characters and story, but I am afraid I would spoil too much for it to be acceptable under the site's review rules. Let 's just say there are very interesting and captivating, and a big part of why I enjoyed the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThis anime clearly had a big budget, because it looks really good. The art style is not unique, the series uses the standard 'modern anime art style', but in a very beautifull, detailed manner. There is good usage of lightning, facial expressions, etc to convey emotions in certain scenes, and the whole series is just very easy on the eye. The fight scenes especially are very nicely and fluently animated and are very energetic. They are a feast to look at and make the show a lot of fun. The backgrounds of scenes and stillshots are also very nice, with lots of tiny details drawn in which make the series look less bland then certain other anime, and again goes to show this was made by an experienced studio with a high budget.\\n\\n\r\nSound/music\\n\\n\r\nThe endings and openings of both seasons are not my favourite, I tend to like my openings more cute/happy/hyperactive, but such songs would off course not have fitted the story and overall tone of this show. The music in the episodes however was great. It effectively (like the art) conveyed emotions such as sadness, happiness, excitement etc. At certain times, it blended in so well with the show that I almost stopped noticing it was there.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound... is the sound. It's good, which mostly means that I did not notice anything odd or off about the way things sounded to tell me it was not good. Voice acting  (I watched the Japanese version) was good, fight sounds were good, etc. It's perfectly fine, nothing more to be said really.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed the show because of the interesting story with the unexpected plot twists, the suspense, the cool fight scenes, the interesting characters, and the beautifull animation. I recommend anyone to watch the show if they're at all interested in action and/or fantasy anime shows. I rate it a 8/10 overall.",

            "content": "NOTE: This review is for both seasons of Fate/Stay night(FSN): Unlimited Blade Works(UBW). This review will be making some comparisons to both of DEEN's FSN anime, the visual novel, and Ufotable's Fate/Zero(F/Z) anime, though I will do my best to avoid spoilers from those works as there are people who decided to start their journey into Type-Moon/Fate with this anime series. For those who care, I got into the franchise with the FSN visual novel and have read all currently translated fate works.\r\nUBW, and Fate in general, is a story in a setting many anime viewers are already familiar with by now, as FSN isarguably the most popular and well known Visual Novel, and has had many successful(at least in terms of popularity and sales) anime based on it and its spinoffs. It is based in the setting of the Holy Grail war ritual, a battle royal where seven mages each summon a familiar called a servant to battle for them. Each familiar is placed into one of seven unique classes, Saber, Archer, Lancer, Caster, Rider, Berserker, and Assassin, and each servant is based on a famous hero of myth, such as your typical Greek Heroes from stories like the Iliad or the Odyssey like Odysseus. Each servant is also gifted with a weapon(or weapons) associated with their myth called a noble phantasm, and then given abilities based on the feats they performed there and the class they are summoned into, but to go into more detail about this would be beyond the scope of the review and best experienced watching the story. The winner of this battle royal will gain the right to obtain the holy grail, and as such have any wish they desire granted. The story of UBW, and FSN as a whole, is set in the 5th holy grail war.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who hear the word \"visual novel\" and immediately think \"Does that mean it's going to have sex in it?\" FSN is a visual novel that has been rereleased with an all ages version, and that is the version of the story UBW choose to follow, so the one sex scene normally found in UBW is not found here. For those planning to watch the Heaven's Feel movies, I cannot make any such promises about those films in regards to sexual content. For those worried that UBW might still be filled with fanservice of the ecchi nature, UBW doesn't really have any more than your typical anime does.\\n\\n\r\nUfotable's adaptation of UBW is an anime in a very awkward position. For starters, it already received an adaptation in the form of a movie in 2010, about five years ago at the time of writing it. As such, in addition to the original source material already being very famous and well known, many people already know the core story of the route and its many twists, despite how poor of an adaptation the original movie was. Secondly, it is an adaptation of a medium notorious for receiving poor adaptations, the visual novel. Visual novels(VNs) are stories that generally make heavy use of multi branching/narrative story lines and as such stories of this format do not translate well into anime because anime generally rely on a single chance to tell a story while VNs are usually packages of stories that all build on top of each other. As a result, there are often things only told in one route of a story, such as character development, themes, and of course the main plot of the route, that will be missed out on by only adapting one route of the story into an anime. While there are visual novels that do not rely on multi route story telling such as the When they Cry series, Utawarerumono, and Steins;Gate, FSN is not one of them. \\n\\n\r\nThis brings us to the next point of UBW's awkward position as an anime adaptation: it is the second route of a VN where the story is told in sequential order. While most VNs are told such that you have some choice on how to proceed with the story into each route, the FSN VN forces you to play the game in the order of the Fate route(what the old DEEN anime was based on), UBW(what this anime and DEEN's old move is based on), and finally Heaven's Feel(HF, what Ufotable's movies will be based on). As a result of UBW being an adaptation of the second route, it assumes that you are already aware of details from the first route, Fate. Such details include more development for characters who get little to no screen time in UBW, resolutions of themes and character arcs, a better explanation of how certain characters magic and abilities work, and general foreshadowing and world building. As the old anime adaptation of the Fate route is of very low quality (other than the OST) and is a poor adaptation of the Fate route, most anime only watchers are generally warned to avoid it and thus miss out on details from the route if they choose not to watch it or read the story in the VN.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, this also brings us to the final point of awkwardness, Ufotable's adaptation of F/Z. F/Z, released in 2006,  is a prequel to FSN, released in 2004, and was originally a light novel. Ufotable adapted this prequel to FSN back in 2011, and the anime was met with much critical acclaim and success, the result of which can be said to have contributed to Ufotable making this anime and the movie adaptation of HF currently in production. It also introduced a new group of fans to the franchise who only started with the anime F/Z. Because of this, many anime only watchers go into UBW thinking that they will be getting the sequel to F/Z. To be blunt, UBW is not the sequel to F/Z, and the same can be said of FSN as a whole. Of the three routes in FSN, UBW is the one with the least amount of connection to all the plotlines \"left\" from F/Z. Additionally, as F/Z was based off of a light novel told from only one story/narrative, it adapts much better into anime form as it tells its story all in one go without needing to wait for others to fill you in on all the details. If you go into UBW expecting the sequel to F/Z, chances are you're going to be disappointed, as FSN was not structured to follow after FZ, but rather FZ was designed to build off what you know of FSN. As a side note, of the three routes, HF is the one with the most connection to F/Z, but even it doesn't wrap up everything and leaves some details to only be concluded in the Fate route. As such, if you started with F/Z, and are looking forward to a version of FSN that works as the sequel to F/Z, you'll likely enjoy HF the most, however this does not mean you won't be able to enjoy UBW.\\n\\n\r\nOne other difference to note about FSN when compared to F/Z is that unlike F/Z, FSN has an air of mystery to its story telling. FSN makes (primarily in the Fate route) makes heavy use of foreshadowing and there are many details that are presented in the story that don't fully become clear and apparent until much later on in the route, or even in another route entirely.\\n\\n\r\nWith all this in mind, it shows that Ufotable clearly had quite the challenge ahead of them in creating this anime. Personally, I believe the people who will get the most enjoyment out of the UBW anime are people who were already long time Fate fans, as UBW makes many small references to all the major Fate works, and while the anime is still strong enough to be enjoyed as you like, the lack of knowledge from the Fate route can hurt your. This is key, as the thing to keep in mind about UBW, and FSN as a whole, is that the whole story is only told when you look at each route together in one picture.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough background, lets get to the meat of the review. UBW tells the story of Emiya Shirou(or Shirou Emiya when translated) and his dream of becoming a hero of justice using the setting of the 5th holy grail war to tell it. As the plot is central to his character, the viewers enjoyment of the series will be proportional to how much they like him. Shirou is a character who is also in a very awkward position. While he is a very popular character in Japan and has constantly ranked very well in Type-Moon popularity polls there, he has in some ways not enjoyed the same level of popularity in the western anime community as a result of his portrayal in DEEN's FSN anime where people mistakenly interpret his actions as being sexist in nature, in addition to being the face of the \"People die when they're kill\" meme. While he is also not very well liked in the Fate route of the VN as well, his character is much more popular among visual novel readers starting with his portrayal in the UBW route(or the church scene of the Fate route depending on who you ask). The Shirou in UBW goes through a completely different development than the Fate route, so if you didn't like him there, there is a chance you will find his character more enjoyable in UBW, and for those worried about his character being sexist, he in no way comes across as such a character in UBW. Where as the Fate route lays out the ground work for Shirou's mental state and desires, UBW is the first route to truly dive in and challenge his ideals, doing so in quite the brilliant manner as Shirou is forced to confront the hypocrisies of his dream along with where it will lead him. While Ufotable's portrayal of his character is of course lacking compared to the VN, they still do a very good job getting the core points of his character across, and the way he is handled in the 2nd half of the show is much better than the first half. I believe that Shirou manages to successfully come across as an interesting character in Ufotable's adaptation and that they do a good job at setting up his journey for the eventual comparisons in his character the viewer will be able to make with who he is in HF.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story mostly focuses on Shirou and his ideal, there are still other characters that play important roles in the story. Shirou's servant, Saber, his classmate, Rin, and Rin's servant, Archer, make up the core cast of our heroes for the story. Saber is arguably the most famous character in FSN as a whole, but for UBW she is one whose development and ideals were already explored in the Fate route, so her role in UBW is not as large as it was there. The viewers knowledge of the Fate route will enhance their enjoyment of Shirou's central conflict, as Saber's situation as a character ties into his own with events discussed later on in the story, but otherwise Saber sticks to typical servant duty and is described by the creators as being more of an observant parent in this route. As FSN was still based on a VN with dating elements in it, Rin takes the role this time as the lead heroine. Rin is a character famed for her tsundere tendencies and Zettai Ryouiki (look up the term if you aren't familiar with it), but despite being the heroine and her role is similar to what it was in the Fate route. As an expert mage who is already arguably superior in skill and knowledge compared to her father, she typically takes the role of a sort of \"know it all\" and explains world building aspects and events to the viewer, in addition to acting as Shirou's ally and teacher in the war. However, since the Fate route, our introduction, is over her role as a know it all and teacher is slightly reduced in exchange for her taking more actions as Shirou's ally in the war. Lastly, we have Archer. Archer is a character whose identity you do not learn in the Fate route and spends most of that route injured sneaking in moments of sheer coolness/GARness, but UBW is finally his chance to shine as he takes center stage as the most important servant of the route, with even more badassness to throw around, arguably being more important to the story than Rin at times. His character comes in direct conflict with Shirou's ideals and the conflict between them can be described as the highlight of the story.\\n\\n\r\nOn the antagonist side of things, UBW follows the same pattern as Fate with there being three arcs of antagonists our heroes deal with(though UBW may arguably have four depending on how you view the story of episodes 4-8). For spoiler reasons, I will not discuss the last two arcs, but I will say that these arcs primarily focus on challenging Shirou's ideals and him putting them into practice. For the first arc and most of UBW, the antagonist is the servant Caster. As obvious from the name, Caster is an expert mage whose strategies and methods of warfare are far superior to even the expert strategists of F/Z, and she herself is more inline with what one would think of when thinking of a Caster class servant unlike the one in F/Z. For those coming from F/Z, everything about her defenses and strategies can be pretty jarring, especially when you meet her master. While Caster's story doesn't tie too much into Shirou's story, she does lay the groundwork for the inherent conflicts with his ideals to become apparent and gives the viewer some interesting perspectives on morality as although she is an antagonist, her actions are still not as bad as some of the others around her and she herself has a very understandable and sympathetic wish. Another reoccurring antagonist is Shinji. Shinji's role in UBW is not as large as it was in the Fate route as he spends most of UBW coming across as more cartoony than as a threat, but he still manages to be a character that you will hate as a person due to how much of an asshole he is. While Shinji actually does have some background as a character that explains why he's an asshole(it doesn't justify his actions), Ufotable choose to skip over any of his back story, likely because he plays a larger role as an antagonist again in HF, so he ends up being more of an asshole.\\n\\n\r\nIn the grand scope of things, UBW focuses on a very small cast of core characters. In my opinion, the anime does an excellent job at fleshing out the characters central to this route and there are many things to be learned and discussed from their actions. UBW also has some minor characters, masters, and servants that get some focus in the story, but most of these characters do not get much development, but what development they do get can be pretty interesting. For those worried about any characters that did not get much development in this route, these characters all play a much larger and more important role in HF so look forward to seeing them in action then.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters, their conflicts, and relations to each other are what drive the plot of UBW, the other key thing to UBW that most people want to see are the action scenes! Ufotable is a studio that became famous for their beautiful artwork and animation presented in their adaptations of Kara no Kyoukai and Fate/Zero, and UBW largely continues that trend and of course surpassing its predecessors in certain areas. UBW has fantastic artwork and coloring that makes the anime look much more visually appealing that F/Z, though the character designs can be a bit lacking at times, noticeably the noses. Another problem with UBW is that the CGI used has not really improved much since F/Z. Regardless, the animation is still top notch for a TV series, easily surpassing the most well animated scenes of F/Z in the first episode alone. When it comes to displaying the servants innate abilities and skills, UBW does a much better job of displaying these abilities visually than F/Z, notably a certain characters instinct skill. In general, the choreography is much better and more exciting to look at. Ufotable's job at handling this area of the show is so well done that it alone makes the series worthy watching as was the case with its predecessor. The climatic battle of UBW in particular was handled phenomenally and was easily one of the best action scenes I've ever seen in any anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, for the last part of the review, we will discuss sound. UBW is a bit lacking in the sound department and this is the weakest aspect of the show. The main problem with the music is that it plays at too low a volume. While the BD's have apparently raised the volume of the songs, it can be very hard to hear or notice the tracks being played at times, but the tracks themselves can be pretty great at times. Another nice thing about the music is that almost every scene has custom tailored music, so you don't have to deal with the same small amount of songs getting repeated over and over again. This was a problem with F/Z as hearing \"battle to the strong\", while a good song, again during the climactic battle of the story instead of something new wasn't very exciting. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in the anime is also pretty phenomenal. Many of the VAs, particularly Shirou, Shinji, and Assassin's VA's, give the best performances they've given yet in any Fate works they've appeared in. Additionally, a certain Golden Haired character has leagues better voice work than his portrayal in both of DEEN's anime where he comes across as more cartoony, but in UBW he feels more serious and dignified.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, UBW is a pretty great anime with tons of things to offer for everyone. Great animation, amazing action, intriguing characters, and top tier world are the main highlights. As a huge fan of the visual novel, I was extremely satisfied with the end result we got, though I will admit there are some parts of the series I wish were better portrayed. The pacing of the second half was not as great as I would have liked it to be. There were some episodes that were too drawn out while others would have benefited from being hour long episodes instead of half hour long ones. There were also a bunch of small nitpicky details that were missing here and there, but I think most of them are things that would only bother hardcore VN readers as opposed to more casual anime viewers.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I rate Ufotable's adaptation of UBW a 9/10, and certainly think of it as one of the best visual novel adaptation out there. For those who wish to read the VN for a deeper experience of the story, feel free to do so, but for those who want a more casual experience of UBW, the anime is an excellent adaptation that will do a great job getting the viewer ready for analyzing HF.",

            "content": "To start, I would like to say that if you are a real fan of Fate/Zero, you'll be a little disappointed, if you really expect it to be better than the Fate/SN from 2006... But, what to expect from it ?\r\nFirst of all, for the ones who didn't see other routes of Fate, it's not a remake from the 2006's Fate/SN, it's just another route, so that explains why it's different in some ways the character takes along the anime. \r\nNow, I'll show my opinion about it, since the first Fate/SN, The normal and logical rule is \" Masters against masters and servants agains servants\";but why ? It's simple, servants are HEROES, warrios, they are trained for it, and master are humans, they need servants to win the war, and that's why humans can't beat servants. Fate/SN UBW broke this rule, because of the overpower protagonist, Shirou is a guy that defeated the most incredible servants of all times AND himself as a HERO. That sounds impossible, but it's a little uncomfortable for people who are expecting a new Kiritsugu in the world. I'm not saying that he HAS to be weak, only that he appears more as a student than a awesome warrior...\\n\\n\r\nI noticed as well that it put all the characters more powerful than the other series, with an INCREDIBLE AGILITY... yes, this is a uncomfortable thing too, the servants and some masters ( like Shirou ) gained the ability to move faster than normal people, you can notice this on the fighting scenes. Although i like fast characters ( like Kiritsugu and kirei on Fate/Zero ), the exaggerated speed made me think I was watching a typical shounen anime, where it's very common. The difference is that on Fate/Zero, the fastest characters are trained to it, it's an ability, it means, AN EXPLANATION.\\n\\n\r\nFate/SN UBW had beautiful scenes, good moments and a good enjoyment in some episodes, the art and sound are awesome and very clear, but the story ( in my opinion ) lost for the Fate/SN from 2006. In general, it is a good anime and it was worth to watch. I didn't expect it to be brilliant as Fate/Zero, but it let me down a bit.",

            "content": "Unlimited Botched Works. No seriously, that's what this show is. For reference, I've only watched Fate/Zero and half of the DEEN adaptation of Fate/Stay Night before this, and I was left pretty disappointed. \r\nFirst, the visuals. You may expect me to praise them to death, but I won't. Don't get me wrong, the gradients and textures are polished to a remarkable degree, and the CGI implementation is flawless, but there's more to visuals than just the technical side. The artistic side is what falls flat, which is a shame considering it's ufotable. Where Fate/Zero had plenty of sharp edges to its objects and harsh shadowsto enhance its dark tone, UBW just looks shiny, which doesn't contribute to any specific themes from the show. Not to mention most of the fighting animation flies by so quick you can't see anything that's going on. When there's no fighting, it's even worse. Camera angles and character animations during conversations are usually pretty bland and static, and something about the faces in the characters just scream a lack of detail. So even though the show looks super shiny, it was honestly really boring to watch, due to the artistic elements coming short. Music is decent but there aren't too many memorable tracks this time around.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is this show even trying to accomplish? I... don't know. That's by far UBW's biggest problem; ufotable (or whoever was in charge) seemed to want to do everything, but it just doesn't combine into a coherent show. Does it want to follow-up Fate/Zero? That can't be, because of the large tone difference and how it doesn't try to neatly wrap up character arcs lingering from the previous series. Does it want to be a standalone work? No, there's too many references to Fate/Zero. A faithful adaptation of the visual novel? No, there's too many important anime-exclusive arcs and scenes. A lighthearted moe dating simulator with every girl digging Shirou? No, because there's too much edgy stuff; but it can't be a serious and dark show either because there's too much out-of-place moe or other shlock bogging it down. The writing for this UBW is truly incompetent, and the characters are victims of this. \\n\\n\r\nOhhhhh boy, the characters. To give my full thoughts, I'll need to spoil, but let me make a sweeping statement and say that they're not very good. At all. They're just a flawed concept overall; especially our two heroes. The characters with potential don't receive enough time to be fleshed out before biting the dust either.\\n\\n\r\n(SPOILERS AHEAD)\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with Rin. She joins a brutal war that she knows took her father's life and risks her own for.... fun? You're kidding, right? Not even to win the grail? She's also supposed to be a cool-headed and intelligent mage, but behaves like a five year old when around Shirou. Any competent tactician should not get flustered so easily and have \"tsundere\" as such a big part of their thought process. It's not cute, it's aggravating; especially when their romance goes nowhere. At the end she LIVES WITH Shirou and yet they still aren't in a proper relationship, considering Luvia still believes she has a chance. Why does Rin even like Shirou? She even tried to literally kill him at one point, and legitimately threatened his life on other occasions. Rin is just a horrible concept of a character, which is a problem considering she's our main heroine. \\n\\n\r\nShirou? You've already heard the horror stories of him. He's excruciatingly naive and idealistic, and still largely retains his ideals despite being proven wrong on too many instances to count. The fact that he says \"just because you're correct doesn't mean you're right\" (if there's no translation errors) proves this. When he's not frustrating to watch, he's boring. Most of his dialogue consists of platitudes. Needless to say, I don't ship Shirou and Rin. \\n\\n\r\nArcher was decent but should've been the main antagonist. Gilgamesh basically hijacks the plot from him even though he's a far less thematically relevant villain. There's no debating with him, he'll just toy with you and then impale your body. While an entertaining villain, he's a poor fit for this show. Caster was pretty good though, she really does feel like a genuine threat considering how many times she thwarts our heroes and even steals Saber. Oh that's right, Saber! She's boring and lacks the strong sense of chivalry she had in Fate/Zero. When Saber lost, I didn't feel a thing, because she was always just kinda there. Didn't do much on her own accord; just followed orders with a straight face. At least Saber's good waifu material, right? Well, UBW thinks so, considering the completely pointless bride dress she was forced to wear. Ilya and Berserker also had potential, but really needed more than just one episode to develop their characters. Lancer is cool but you don't really get to know him much. Almost everyone else isn't worth mentioning. Their motives are so unclear and resolution so unfulfilling that it's obvious the writers didn't care, so why should I?  \\n\\n\r\n(SPOILERS END) \\n\\n\r\nI apologize for the length of this review, but it was a long time coming. It really pains me to say that UBW is an immensely disappointing show. The only reason I don't give it a less-than-mediocre score is because of the visual polish and a few great scenes and episodes such as the 3rd or 10th ones that built up tension really well. But really, if you loved Fate/Zero and want a followup, or experienced the visual novel and want it done justice, don't bother. Leave those memories untainted. Newcomers will also be confused due to all the references to the Fate franchise's expansive lore. Please don't watch UBW; it's not a bad show, but it's so frustratingly average (or even worse) that it'll only waste your time. \\n\\n\\n",

The 'servants' aren't as interesting as F/Z. \r\nAnimation -  ufotable does it again. 11/10 for a series.\r\nMusic - 9/10 , good soundtrack \r\nOverall - 8/10 (GOOD)   \r\nTLDR ; ok story , great animation , still definitely worth your timeto watch this instead of the other *cough* fan svc trash around.

            "content": "All of you fanboys, this low grade, along with my annoyance, is as much your fault as is writer's! You made me expect a masterpiece, yet this is but a single stairstep above your everyday fantasy shounen. I kinda hated the writing, as I found it had a plethora of bad writing indicators, such as lack of foreshadowing and various asspulls. It felt like everything was happening for the sake of the plot, rather than it being a natural progression of events. I'll have to go into spoilers to continue: \r\nSPOILERS AHEAD: \r\nPerfect example of how bad the writing this had, was the death andepisode of Illya. First she appears early on, just to play the cliche as all hell card of villain who will not defeat the good guys now but will come back some other time because reasons. Then she's pointlessly totally gone from the plot for the longest time, not because that would make sense, but because the plot demanded it,... just to be back for her death episode. So since writers didn't think any of this through they were like ''oh shit we forgot to develop her character or make her relevant in any way, quick, throw in a tearjerker flashback deathflag just before we murder her to get the viewers to care and get emotional''. This is just one example of some of the cheapest writing I've ever seen. And to find this in a show that is hailed as a masterpiece from one the most esteemed VN franchises of all time, just blew my mind. \\n\\n\r\n I probably shouldn't even go into how little sense plot logic makes, with the Shirou Archer causal relationship and whatnot. But I wouldn't let mere plot logic ruin things for me,... rather it was Shirou's character arc that did it. Disregarding the fact he should have died in nearly every single episode, the story practically becomes about his internal conflict of wanting to be the hero of justice. Excuse me while I turn off this shounen red alert that just went of..... *click* there we go, now I can hear myself think again. Conflict where he is ''forced'' to face the fact that facing the fact that he can't save everyone (cause saving someone sometimes means not saving someone else) will make him lose track of this childhood ideal of his. Yes, read that sentence again. No, it still doesn't make sense. Plus it's somewhat of an irresponsible message hinting that change, as in growing up and changing your mind, is bad. While this can be an interesting and meaningful theme, I can't imagine it being dealt with worse than here. It basically came down to not wanting to grow up being a good thing somehow? Otaku pandering much? Like, suppose your adult self traveled back in time and told you you're wrong about some things. You'd be sane to believe him right? Providing you know the situation to be genuine. But no, not in Fate universe. Here, spouting shounen nonsense at your older self actually makes you fight stronger! Ooh, our shounen protagonist has to deal with drama and character development and whatnot... oh wait, that doesn't automatically make said drama and development any good whatsoever. Who would have thought? And by the way, your reward for being a dumbass shounen protagonist is this super awesome girl that likes you because this was originally a servicey VN in which heroine has to fall for the protagonist regardless of it making sense.\\n\\n\r\nNot that I mind having romance, in fact, watching Rin be Rin and go all tsun tsun in various SoL situations pretty much made the show. Well, that and the out of this fucking world animation and production budget. Based ufotable. You made this clusterfuck of a story watchable and occasionally really enjoyable, kudos. You deserve Mt.Fuji sized cookie.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to go on a slight tangent: Fate/Zero on the other hand is basically Urobuchi saying ''oh look, cool premise, let's see how it would look if writing didn't suck''. But even then, fantasy shounen-ish setting can only get you so far, hence why first season for both is a bit disappointing, mainly due to all the status quo-ing. Zero gets rather awesome in second season, while UBW tries to get awesome but falls flat on it's face, still somehow managing to at least stay interesting enough. Actually the reason I enjoyed second season/half of UBW a bit more is due to both more pretty action, and story becoming more complicated, so keeping track of all the nonsense that's going on was actually rather amusing. Plus the nonsense got even more nonsensical, in a ''so bad it's good'' kinda way.",

            "content": "FSN- Unlimited Blade Work is a thrilling romance-action-fantasy in a world where magic is possible and about the grail war, a battle royale which involve 7 servants and masters, each given their own unique abilities\r\nBefore i start this review, i want to point out some things\r\n- I didnt know and didnt play the VN so this review is complete anime based\r\n- Before i watched this anime, i completed fate zero 1st and give it 10/10 instantly, so expect to see some comparisons.\r\n- Expect to see some light and huge spoiler ahead, ill give a warning so dont worry\r\n- My opinion is not biased just becausei watched FZ before, all the opinion mentioning FZ here is just my personal preferences\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\r\nThe story focuses on 4 protagonist, that is Saber, Archer, Shirou and Tohsaka. The setting is your usual high school anime, BUT there is an extra fantasy tags and the story is about the grail war, to make any wishes come true the \"master\" such as shirou and tohsaka fight for it. All of the main characters get their story well done. Archer become badass and ALMOST make him my favourite character. The story is very unique, that you could not simply forget this anime without pointing the grail war, each servant has their own ability and its fun to see how each one of them fight.\\n\\n\r\nAaaaaand yes there is romance. The romance between shirou and tohsaka give no problems to me at all but the progression between them is boring, and there is no dramatic moment in it. I did not say it is bad, but... yes it become so dull at the end that i forget there is any progression at all, \\n\\n\r\n*SPOILER ALERT*\\n\\n\r\nPlot holes, whoa i could point out many here but since it will become a HUGE spoiler i will point out here :\\n\r\n *SPOILER ALERT**SPOILER ALERT**SPOILER ALERT**SPOILER ALERT*\\n\\n\r\n1. Archer death and the way he return. I would be fine if the anime producers just give some explanations like archer escaped at that short amount of time but they don't\\n\r\n2. Gilgamesh getting eaten by the grail. I might look stupid because i dont understand it, but i really dont understand it and they didnt give any explanation at all. The reason he is eated,... so the grail war can continue? or so the grail live or what???? seriously guys\\n\r\n3. Once more, When kotomine kirei appeared again at the scene with lancer, if he isnt dead AGAIN they didnt give us explanation why, caster, can let that guy live\\n\r\n4. Lancer's master. \" Oy what about his master?\" \"i dont care, let's progress the romance even farther!\" - Producer\\n\\n\r\n- SPOILER OFF -\\n\\n\r\nOther than that i would like to point out that Fate Zero is really interesting anime with a great character development between EACH of 7 servants and master, in here the one whos getting development are just a pair of masters and a pair of servant.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the ending, idk why but it is unsatisfying for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is also a bot off with me, its too slow for me, not worth 25 episodes at all. Most of the time they're just talking bout strategy. Nearly each episode of the second half have the MC monologue about 3 mins maybe? well i didnt count it but that is boring, because the monologue is always about the same thing over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nSo with that many plot holes ,uninteresting romance, i will give it 6, even tho its an interesting and unique story, the executions is really bad. And if you found an answer to the holes i pointed out above please explain , please do so\\n\\n\r\nArt-10\\n\r\nWell this art is one, no, the best art in whole anime i've ever seen and the battle scenes look 3d. Its really cool when saber fight with any of the servant.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9\\n\r\nNo complain here, the sound is great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -7\\n\r\nThe characters, how i describe it... umm there are some i like and some i... didnt know. At some first episodes, rider didnt even fight at all and die(no, i will not give any spoiler alert because her die is meaningless). Lancer is badass at some first episodes but get uninteresting later on. But there are also some good characters in this series: Gilgamesh( NO IM NOT JOKING), Archer and Shirou.\\n\r\n1 more thing about character in FZ that i want to appear in this series.. that is Waver and Kirei. Oh i forget kirei appear in this series... \\n\\n\r\nComparisons aside i'd like to give the characters 7 because beside all of the bad explanation on characters, there are also good ones and our mc get most development which is good\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5.5\\n\r\nIf i'd compare the enjoyment with this series and FZ, i will give it 4 but comparisons aside 6 is enough for this anime. There are no comedy( i mean \"funny\" one) in school life and teen setting which make it feel more Thrilling and cool IF the series itself SERIOUS in giving the atmosphere at all. Romance is bad in this series imo, its one of the worst aspect. Saber, a character that i'd like to see her development in this series didnt get any, despite all the talk in FZ with rider, she never give any objection about shirou, such as choosing \"hero of justice\" path that she choose and she failed. I'd like to see an episode where shirou and saber fight or just simply argue because of that, but it didnt.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\n+Great OP and art save the overall score for me\\n\r\n+Each of the main character is likeable and the 2 \"core\" character got many development\\n\\n\r\n-Story is executioned bad. Unique idea but the execution is bad.\\n\r\n-Except Ilyasviel, every other character beside 4 main didnt get any development\\n\r\n(my personal preferences)\\n\r\n-They didnt give a fuck about the grail war 10 years ago, they should.",

Rin acts like a generic tsundere instead of a mature person who can actually hold a conversation. Lots of time is wasted showing characters like Caster when they should have spent the run time conveying Shirou's psychological characterization from the VN. Archer's lines make no sense because Shirou's inner thoughts are never conveyed. The translation quality is terrible. Three episodes are spent having Shirou, Archer, and Saber repeat the same lines at each other. The action scenes are flashy and meaningless, they do not convey any of thefascinating thoughts Shirou had during them.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend the Japanese VN (not the terrible fan translation) for those interested in proper characterization and dialogue over flashy visuals.",

In this one there is more character development than in Fate/SN, at least for Archer, Illya, Souchiro Kozuki, Lancer and even Berserker(Well maybe not that much) But they do have more participation and we get to know their motives.  This one feels also more related to Fate/Zero then Fate/SN as a sequel. As I said before the first season is kind of slow but there are some good moments like the battle with Caster, the interactions between Archer and Shirou and Kotomine Kirei that even though that guy is evil as F\u2026 he is a really good character at least to play as a decent villain. The second season starts with betrayal, surprises and good battles at this point I\u00b4going to admit that is NOT THE BEST ANIME EVER! To be honest I don\u00b4t think that such anime even exist because there are a lot of genders, stories and so on but UBW is REALLY GOOD. \\n\r\nSo lets continue... I liked the art, the animation is very good, the battle scenes are very good as well. \\n\r\nThe plot for me was good too. It surprises me in some episodes like Lancer\u00b4s behavior and Kotomine\u00b4s dead. I know that Saber did not have a lot of participation, lets say, but still one of the most important characters even though her relationship with Shirou was different that the one in Fate/SN. Illya\u00b4s story for me was  really good and explains us what happened to her after the fourth Holy grail war.\\n\r\nCharacters I loved all of them the played their part as they were supposed. Well maybe Shinji wasn\u00b4t my favorite but he did had relevance in the story.\\n\r\nWhat I didn\u00b4t like I would have loved that Sakura had had more participation in the story taking in consideration she is Rin\u00b4s sister, but well we can\u00b4t have it all right? \\n\r\nSo for me this series deserves a 9/10 And I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "Anyone who sees this show should not compare it to Fate/Zero. UBW is not meant to be the sequel to Zero. UBW is part of the three routes of Fate/Stay Night along with Heaven's Feel and Fate. Zero is the prequel of Fate/Stay Night to explain the events of the VN. \r\nIt's very hard to adapt a VN. Especially Fate, with 15+ hours a route. In order to adapt an anime, you lose a lot of Shirou's monologues and more detail of the story. A novel will always be better than the anime. Despite this, UBW is probably one of the best anime to comeof this year.\\n\\n\r\nI have read the VN, and UBW is my favorite route. Not as light as Fate, not as dark as Heaven's Feel. It's a melancholy balance. The anime was put a bit in an awkward place. To truly understand it, you have to finish the Fate Route of the VN. However, UBW by itself is a ruby. Perhaps when the others come out it will become a pearl. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are always the most important part of the VN. Shirou loses the most because his point of view is hard to depict, but he is an enjoyable protagonist who you can understand. Rin and Saber are the heroines with a past. They are fun, enjoyable, and make the anime fun. We have Archer, personally my favorite character in all anime, who is a realistic, cool, badass. Lancer, a champion with a heart of gold, gets a few episodes in the spotlight. Then we have Shinji, who we're supposed to hate, and Kotomine, a thoroughly enjoyable villain. The anime did very well to adapt intricate characters that we can thoroughly enjoy or despise. However, all the characters are interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and art are obviously the center of this piece. They beat all the other anime. There truly is no comparison for the \"Unlimited Budget Works.\" It makes the story much more enjoyable and a visual marvel for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is strong by itself, despite the setbacks of its awkward position (Needs a fate route to give a bit more info). The Holy Grail War is an interesting marvel, the clash of ideals regarding a \"hero of justice\", all of the story makes you both enticed and inquisitive. \\n\\n\r\nTruly, this is an enjoyable anime no matter what. It deserves a 10 from me and you guys too.",

            "content": "***This review may contain spoilers and has gone under the assumption you have previously finished Fate/zero.***\r\nLets start off by stating; Fate/stay night has some big shoes to fill. Its predecessor, Fate/zero, was a smashing hit and was well received by the anime community. Can the sequel to such a monumental anime live up to expectations? No, it couldn't, but it did do a lot right in its own regard.\r\nFate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works is an anime adaptation, created by ufotable, of babies first visual novel... Sorry, Fate/stay night. The visual novel has three separate routes: the Fate route, the Unlimited Blade Works route and HeavensFeel route. This anime, as the title says, is the Unlimited Blade Works route, adapted into a 25 episode series.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6/10\\n\r\nThe Holy Grail War is an age-old tradition that happens in Fuyuki city where seven Masters summon seven Servants. These Master Servant pairings must fight it out and eliminate one another until there is only one Master Servant pair left. Once there is only one pair left, the omnipotent wish granting device, the Holy Grail, reveals itself and grants one wish. The fifth Holy Grail War is the setting for Fate/stay night, and takes place ten years after the events of Fate/zero.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise sounds interesting and unique. The story can be riddled with surprising twists, unexpected alliances, betrayal, tactical warfare, and interesting relations between characters. The fear of knowing one could be killed at any moment sounds exhilarating. However, none of that really comes into play and instead we get a high school setting, with a bland main character, who has his own harem that he has to deal with. They story of Fate/stay night is unrealistic of the situation our characters find themselves in. The characters make stupid decision after stupid decision that can hardly be rationalized. The atmosphere feels far too care free given the circumstances. This is where Fate/stay night falls short compared to Fate/zero. The viewer doesn't get the same sense of urgency that Fate/zero offered, nor does it make the viewer feel as if the characters may die at any moment if they overstep their bounds. The pacing of the show is also incredibly slow and feels as if there is a lot of \"filler\" in each episode. Most of season one takes place at school, filled with characters have nothing to do with the grail war in the first place. The amount of time something just wasn't explained, or had an awful reasoning for an explanation is ludicrous. I know that Unlimited Blade Works was just one route of a possible three in the visual novel and that a lot of key elements might be distributed throughout all three routes, but come on, make it at least a bit of a better Anime viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the premise of the story is interesting and continued off of what Fate/zero had going, but was executed poorly and riddled with missed opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 4/10\\n\r\nThe characters of Fate/stay night can be summed up into one word: Unlikable. Forget the comparison to Fate/zero, which, by the way, had an incredible cast of characters; Fate/stay night has almost nothing going for it in terms of characters.\\n\r\nYou can put make up on an ugly person, but at the end of the day, even though you made he/she look a little better for the time being, he/she is still ugly. That pretty much sums up three of the four main characters. Shiro, Rin, and Saber are so bad it's laughable. The show has it's brief periods of brilliance with adding depth and development to our main characters, but after the scene/episode, they go back to their same old self. The only character among the main group that doesn't completely suck is Archer, and even then he really wasn't that great. In terms of supporting cast the only characters that got any sort of spot light was Caster and Caster's master. Beyond that maybe Berserker, Ilya, Shinji and lancer... but at that point you're reaching. Everyone else is pretty much a write off with how little screen time they get and how little importance they have on the story itself and that includes the main villain, gilgamesh.\\n\r\nFor a show that is so heavily focused on the adventures of Shiro and Rin, they sure dropped the ball. Unlimited Blade Works focused so hard on the main two characters that it cut time from other supporting characters and they couldn't even get the relationship for Shiro and Rin to work, let alone make them stand alone, likable characters.\\n\r\nI don't know if ufotable did an awful job adapting the characters from the visual novel, or if the visual novel itself just sucks, but something went horribly wrong...\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimations - 10/10\\n\r\nFinally, a shining light for this god forsaken anime.\\n\r\nYes, ufotable does it again, creating a stunning looking anime. The animations quality was that of Fate/zero or even better. This might just be their best work yet. The motions were fluid and clean. Fight scenes, even the minor ones, were beautiful to watch. Everything, from the gorgeous fight scenes, right down to even basic scenes such as Rin and Shrio talking to each other looked great.\\n\r\nOverall fantastic animations quality. So good it should be reason enough to at least pick up and try the show out.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nThe other shining light, the soundtrack.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, composed and created by Yuki Kajiura, was overall very well done and put together nicely. Each scene had a fitting piece to it and nothing felt out-of-place or awkward. The tracks themselves are also all incredible in their own right. Honestly, this was one of Yuki Kajiura weaker roles... but was still great none the less. The soundtrack did not live up to Fate/zero's soundtrack, but it definitely has more than a passable grade.\\n\r\nBoth opening and endings we're great as well. Kalafina, Aimer and Mashiro Ayano all made awe-inspiring songs that set the mood perfectly for the start of the show and as a lasting impression after the episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Watching Fate/stay night as a \"sequel\" to Fate/zero is a mistake. It is a misleading title that has next to no \"sequel\" attributes to speak of. Watching Fate/stay night as a stand alone project that is not bogged down by the weight of Fate/zero is an actual good viewing experience. Fate/zero was a monumental, once in a life time Anime that Fate/stay night just could not live up to. Honestly, Fate/stay night is not even that bad of a show as a stand alone project. Just getting past the \"sequel\" part might be hard to wrap one's head around. If anything, watching Fate/stay night first, then going to Fate/zero would be a better viewing experience instead of the other way around.\\n\r\nThe show, overall,  was a train wreck, but was thankfully salvaged by the all-star line up of ufotable and Yuki Kajiura. It had its moments of brilliance but squandered the moments the show itself created. Unlimited Blade Works was incredibly hit or miss, it's just too bad it was more miss than hit.",

            "content": "Spoilers: For me Anime is not the only thing I do, watch, and is interested in. So when I watch an Anime to completion it has to have caught my attention. The Fate/Zero series I saw on Netflix couple of year ago an really enjoyed it and when I saw that Unlimited Blade Works had been released I had to watch it as well. Overall I enjoyed the series. I feel that this season, however, felt a little dragged on compared to season 1. Maybe because in Fate/Zero we were watching more than one story unfold compared to just following Shir\u014d & Rin around &season 1 of UBW felt decently fast paced. A good example of this was Kirei just showing up in episode 20. I would have liked to have more insight on his and Gilgamesh's interactions.  I also didn't like the whole Shir\u014d & Rin romance for the fact they seem to just walk this line of awkward the entire time. I'm not a guy into cushy lovey dovey stuff, but I would have rather had some progression. Even at the end I wasn't sure if they were together or in some just weird awkward friendship. I don't know, it just bugged me. Also where were Sakura & Taiga all season? Tropical island drinking coconuts? Who knows? Oh, & the memory of I assume Shir\u014d doing back flips...they bring it up once & discard it immediately. Made no sense to me. And my final complaint was Waver. Him & Rider were my favorite characters from Fate/Zero, but the way they do it is just odd. I had to google just to make sure it was him like I thought. All in all, while I have my complaints its still a great watch. The action scenes look great and the dialogue was always superb. If you liked Animes like Sword Art Online, Attack on Titan, or The Future Diary(Mirai Nikki) I think you will enjoy it.",

The fight scenes are so fluid that it feels as if your eyes were blessed by the gods that are Ufotable \r\nSound: 10/10- My ears were blessed for 13 episodes straight.\r\nCharacters: 8/10- Withoutany spoilers I can say the main characters Rin,Shirou, and Saber are really the only one that get any development, but that can't really be helped due to the enormous cast that is introduced (Then possibly killed of later), but overall I thought most of the character's were very respectable, they're heroes after all. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10- My eyes were glued on the screen the entire season. You can't really go wrong with watching it. I had a lot of fun of watching it, and it's something I suggest you watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:- 9/10- Fate/Stay night is one a great series, it has flaws in some regards to its story and progression, but the pros heavily outweigh the cons to watching this anime.",

I had to do this and for this reasons I wrotethis introductive note\\n\\n\\n\r\nI usually realize from the very first episodes of a series if I'm watching an awful work, a good enteraining story or a true masterpiece. And I wasn't wrong with Fate: Stay Night Unlimited Blade works. The review will cover the second half of the season: I would have liked to review it in his whole 24 episodes run, but the site don't permit it, so...\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\r\nYes. I give it a solid 10 and many people will be disappointed by this. Because the VN was better, because Fate Zero or Fate Stay Night 2006 were better and such. I never saw the older series and I never played the game, I only investigated some plot points after finishing UBW because some things weren't clear. \\n\r\nIn my opinion, the story is perfect. Just like that. Initially, especially in the first series, some points bugged me. I will not spoil plot details there, however, because in my opinion, if you decide to watch this anime, you don't really want spoilers\\n\r\nThe second half of the first arc left me disappointed. Filler episodes, a slow pacing, anticlimactic things (such as battles that are stopped for no reasons)\\n\r\nWell, from the very first episode of the second arc, I understood that things were changing. There are two main revelations or plot twists that hit me like a punch in the jaw. Really, I am not a person who gets surprised or excited by plot twists, but, wow...\\n\\n\r\nMASSIVE SPOILER ALERT!!!!\\n\r\nThe first. Archer's betrayal. That make a lot of sense when you discover...\\n\\n\r\n...that his goal is to kill Emyia Shirou because HE IS Emyia Shirou from the future! Since servants came both from the past and the future. Holy shit, the first thing left me speechless and was totally unexpected but also coherent with the story. Because Archer's willingness to work for Rin was motivated by his desire to kill Shirou in the war. This is the reason why he wants so much to attack him in the first arc. And when he understands that Rin is in love with him and will never turns his weapons against him, well, Archer leaves the crew. I don't understand why he didn't killed him on the spot: probably, he decided to destroy his beliefs, first.\\n\r\nAnd the fact that Archer was Shirou. Maybe I was naive but I didn't suspected it for a single moment until the revelation. Mainly because, having never played the VN, I was convinced that servants are only heroes from the real world. I didn't knew that a character of the series could become a Counter Guardian \\n\r\nFrom the first episode of the second arc, the story goes on fluidly. A minor issue was the fact that there are too much dialogues, maybe, and some of them are repetitive. But this thing doesn't take any merit from a beautiful story. \\n\r\nThe ending is probably one of the best final that I ever seen in an anime. In the end, Shirou is unable to change himself. Changing his ideals is either impossible or would make his life meaningless. And so, he will go on on his path, even knowing that it will lead him to his damnation. Even thought that he will suffer and lose everything and everyone, including his ideals. I found this thing dramatically realistic. Think about how many people every day take paths that will lead them to their demise, even suspecting or knowing what will happen. Because men are like that: they are more eager to die than to change themselves. This is the main reason of unhappiness and suffering in the world. \\n\r\nRin Toosaka can only promise to be with him and love him. She says: \"It doesn't matter what will happen to you after. It matters where you will get\" then, we have a panoramic of the sunset and the night on London, with the camera that zooms out from their window, that gives the idea of \u200b\u200ba life that continues to move forward, regardless of what will be tomorrow. And the final monologue of Archer/Shirou: \"He will regret and curse the path that he has chosen. But in the end, I was never wrong\"\\n\r\nThe message is strong: the world is not fair, the world doesn't give a fuck about you and you are the only one responsible for your happiness so, if you chose to follow your path, you and only you will face for the consequences. Doing what is right is not equal to doing what is convenient. Idealists are condemned to unhappiness. However, ideals are not wrong. They make us what we truly are. This is the paradox and the eternal struggle between what we feel right and what we must do to go on. \\n\r\nPowerful. Great. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS END THERE FOR NOW - GO ON SAFELY \\n\\n\r\nI reassume fo the ones who don't want spoilers: the reasons why I gave 10 to the story of UBW are mainly two: great plot twists and strong and realistic messages that will leave you with a lot of questions. Personally, I loved every other aspects of the story but those two points really stand out. \\n\\n\r\nArt -9\\n\r\nAs I read in some memes, \"Unlimited Budget Works!\" \\n\r\nTrue. When you have great funds, you will have great action scenes, breathtaking landscapes (Archer's singularity space is beautiful and reflects perfectly his moral and his past life), well drawn characters and no drops in quality towards the end. There is more to say? \\n\r\nFor action fans, the battles and the fights are great. Amongst the best I have ever seen. \\n\r\nThe setting is beautiful. A blessing fo your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound -9\\n\r\nThe OST features some great tracks such as Ring your bell, This Illusion, EMYIA and, on the top of everything, Brave Shine, that is one of the best openings even heard in an anime (I put it I my playlist even before watching the series)\\n\r\nThe sound effects were also great and the Italian dub is very good, as usually\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-8\\n\r\nSome characters are deeply characterized, some are less explored. Some monologues are a bit exaggerated and sound like boasts, others are powerful and give a perfect reflection of the motives of the characters\\n\r\nHowever, a thing that I loved is the fact that the majority of the characters are interesting. Almost nobody feels out of place or wasted during his screen time, I even appreciated some characters who appeared in a couple of scenes only \\n\r\nI will take the main characters as examples, just to give you an idea\\n\r\nEmyia Shirou is an idealist. In the first arc, I wasn't very fond of him: I thought in multiple occasions that is behavior was stupid and makes no sense in some parts. He is obsessed by the thought of saving everybody, even at the cost of his own life. Then, in the second arc, you understand. He is not mentally stable. The fire that almost killed him in his first ages of life, the fact that his stepfather talked about \"being an hero\"... those things greatly influences a kid...\\n\r\nHence, my interpretation: he suffers from mental issues. For this reason, he is unable to change. Is realistic and is haunting, is the kind of thing that I like to see in a series because is something that happens in everyday life too (expect for the part with the magic and the hope of becoming a Counter Guardian, unfortunately) \\n\r\nThe only spark of hope for his fate is Rin Toosaka\\n\r\nI saw a lot of \"meh\" love relationships in anime but I actually liked the couple Rin-Shirou. Their love is not just \"for the plot and the ship\", it grows more and more strong ad they fight together and risk their lives in a magic Battle Royale where the odds are against them. The fact that a possible sex scene was dropped for a weird sequence with dolphins (yeah, you read it right) was a bit disappointing because that would have been the turning point of their relationship and it would have made sense since they both knew that they could actually be dead the very next day, but I'm satisfied enough by the fact that their couple become official in the ending\\n\r\nRin Toosaka is also an interesting character. She takes part in the Graal War to \"Win it and nothing more\" but, as the story goes on, we can speculate that the does this to avenge his father, who died in the last one. She is smart and she wants so be ruthless but when Shirou is involved in the war, her determination falters. She is not able to be merciless as she wants to be and her feelings come to surface as time goes on. \\n\\n\r\nGUESS WHAT? SPOILERS\\n\\n\r\nArcher. Another great character. His behavior in the first arc is totally justified when we discover that HE IS Shirou and his objective is to kill him to stop existing in the first place. His extreme idealism has lead him to the worst possible outcome, an eternal life that he has to spend killing people for the sake of \"peace\" and the safety of humanity as we know it. I tought that he only wanted to win the Graal war but I was wrong. He is another realistic character: an idealist who is not able to see the harsh reality of the world will often become a nihilist with no faith in humanity or in life, just like him. I felt very connected to him\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS ENDS HERE FOR NOW\\n\\n\r\nA minor disappointment: I felt that Saber is put in the shadows. She deserved a better introspection. Her backstory is not explored much and she is kept a bit off the spotlights and is a shame because she is one of the most iconic characters of the franchise (her backstory is explored mainly in Fate Zero and in the VN\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -9\\n\r\nIf the first arc bored me a bit in his second half, the second arc was amazing. I can't find a single episode that is not entertaining or that feels wasted. Plot twists, great battles between overpowered characters realized with awesome special effects, deep scenes that explore the psychology and the motives of the characters, an interesting depiction of mature themes such as the meaning of ideals, the struggle between what is right and what is convenient, the clash between our desire to act kind and with justice and the ruthless reality of a selfish and violent world that consumes the main character. I didn't expected to find such a maturity in an anime that don't looks exactly aimed to a mature audience from his cover\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat else I can say, Fate Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works was a nice surprise. I expected a good series since this anime is very popular and, as I said, I thought that it could be a masterpiece from the very first episode. His reputation is deserved and I recommend it. Guaranteed, some parts are a bit repetitive and over boasted, some monologues are a bit exaggerated but that's not a major issue. The story is great and you will easily grow fond of the characters. \\n\r\nI'm talking as an occasional anime watcher and I never played the VN (I'm searching it on amazon, however, I have to play it absolutely) so maybe if you are a fan of the original story you may be disappointed by some things that I flat out ignored, however, if you never heard anything about the Fate series, you will be dragged in this world easily by this awesome product.",

            "content": "I don't know how helpful this will be since i have so many thoughts jumbled around in my head after just finishing the UBW series so bare with me. Or don't. \r\nI don't think I have ever come across such a series that I had such conflicting views about, while still enjoying the entire season of UBW(This review is for both seasons). Also, I will be comparing this to the previous fate:zero & not at all with fate stay night, since everyone knows that's shit. \r\nFor starters, let's just get the good out of the way, the good that we can't argue about. Fight scenesare amazing and animated great, as is the animation all around. These things are expected after fate:zero and UBW delivers. As for sound, it fits the series well, though I cannot say I enjoy the openings or endings for any fate series, including this one but the soundtrack is pleasant and memorable to a degree and it certainly fits the show well. \\n\\n\r\nBig fucking problems begin when it comes to characters. This is where my rant begins. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problems people seem to have is that our boy Emiya, the classic shounen dummy, is well, a classic shounen dummy. Not powerful, but has the will do it all. & so on & so on. His views are recycled through anime, and he's pretty annoying. That's all true & his ideals can be a bit repetitive and unoriginal, not at all like my nigga kiritsugu from fate zero. But i don't have a problem with him. It's so recycled that i know what to expect & so you can either bitch about him or just accept him like I did. He wasn't unbearable and  though I can't say he changes too much, as far as mentality(because that's the whole point; sticking to his beliefs) he was an okay character. Rin, the female protag, can be seen as almost just as annoying with opposite yet just as recycled ideals, though unlike emiya, she develops some change but just barely . That's all fine and good. There are even characters that you think are going to be important, and they might have been in the VN, but in UBW? they disappear early on and you never hear from them again, despite scenes where those characters are clearly involved. I can't really say anything for spoiler's sake but you'll know when you see them. \\n\\n\r\nMY biggest problem is the supporting characters. Nearly all are from the same school(a stupid coincidence) & none of them are particularly interesting.. Shinji is like a shit version of that serial killer guy from fate:zero, & illyasaviel is a huge let down, especially as in fate zero her mother had such a huge role with a personality and her role in the story barely serves a purpose, despite being let up from the beginning to be some kind of powerful badass. The truth is, she is boring and turns out to be a garbage character. Then there's the robotic like teacher, who I can't remember his name because that's how boring his character is. He was actually important yet so boring and thus, not memorable. Then there's kirei who was like a huge antagonist(if not THE antagonist) in fate zero with a personality and background. Here, he is little shown, still an asshole, and when he is shown during the end, is a huge let down in the story. A huge let down actually describes this whole show. \\n\\n\r\nAll, and I mean all, the servants were fucking stupid or way less cool. Saber went from being a cool badass with ideals, conflicts & a real personality, as well as character development to a boring cliche ecchi version of herself. Pretty sure emiya thought about fucking her several times as the animators got his face all red everytime she & him talked. They could be talking about soap and next thing you know, emiya's got a hard on for her. Archer(fate zero archer,  gilgamesh) went from being a cool character with an interesting belief system, as well as being a cool villain, to being just a villain. He was an asshole completely & his schemes were stupid & he seemed like a less smart version of himself before. The berserk class was way less interesting than before, served little narrative, and barely had a real impact on the story, unlike the previous one did in fate zero. Lancer class; same story. Less interesting, no background or ideals, or real personality and served no purpose. Assassin? I still don't even get that whole story but it makes sense I don't, since the show never really gave him one. He's an even bigger waste of a character than assassin from the fate zero series but unlike that one, he serves less of a purpose and seems like he was only there to get in people's way at the writer's convenience. Caster character was, for some reason, made up to be such a big deal throughout the show, and in truth, was a big antagonist, but it's like, who the fuck was the chick in real life? never heard of her, & as a servant I never liked her. She had no real ideals or personality, other than that she was a bitch and for some reason, fucking hounded the protags for like 18 episodes or some shit. Then there was the rider character. Holy fuck. She had like 4 lines, one fight scene, and I don't even think they gave her a background, let alone revealed her actual name. Archer was the only servant who had any background, ideals, personality, etc & the reason for that, which I can't say, makes sense given the ending and truths that are revealed but because of that, is a huge copout. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself was terribly paced, random and lacked a linear plot that even remotely made sense. Shit was way too rushed, not so much in the sense that they didn't have enough time, but rather that the writers made that time way too fast. Plots were happening at rates that didn't even make any sense and one minute something is important & the next it isn't. The result? A subpar ending. \\n\\n\r\nFuck, my thoughts are jumbled on this one. \\n\\n\r\nAt least in every episode, something happened. Like there was no wasted moments, and there was lots of action to keep you entertained. Honestly, this shit should be ranked in the 200's but whatever, 96 will have to do. I would suggest watching this, it's fair to good, but if you really want to enjoy this series without a bad taste in your mouth, watch this, then watch fate zero & you will have no bad taste. This sequel is terrible in comparison. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR version\\n\\n\r\nGreat action scenes with great animation and quality sound. Plot is rushed, messy and as a result, develops into a poorly treated story, saved only by your desire to finish the fate series and see what happens. The characters are terrible in comparison to fate zero, especially the servants, and as stand alone, they are poor, often given no background, a unique personality/ideals & can often seem recycled and bland, and a result, boring and unlikable. \\n\\n\r\nJust to finish after my probable unhelpful rant, this show's characters are it's worst attribute and it's story nearly just as bad. No matter what your entertainment value is, was, or will be, if you do not want to be disappointed,  I want to say do not watch this(assuming you have seen fate zero). But, if you wanted to find out how it ended like me, or if you heard good things like me, just give it a try. Reviews shouldn't be the thing that lets you watch something or not. Decide on your own why you didn't like the show. Reviews are pretty useless but I wanted to talk about the show, even if it's just for my own benefit. So, if you got any help from this rant, good. If not, do try and watch the show. \\n\\n\r\nOr don't. squad.",

            "content": "(this is a review of both season1 and season 2 in one bundle)\r\nAfter watching Fate/Zero, I had high expectations for Fate/Stay night. (yes i know the order sucks...) but upon finishing the mediocre fate/Stay night by deen, I was feeling a bit... unsatisfied. And also reluctant to start Fate/Stay night UBW (henceforth F/SNUBW) because it looked like a better animated rerun. But boy was I wrong...also i haven't read the VNs so keep that in mind if that happens to be important.\r\nStory:9\r\nBest part of the story is it's unpredictability. It had alot of twists and turns, a lot of tension and suspense derived from that.The premise of the story is basically the same as Fate/Zero, but how it played out was much more intense. And that was what really placed it at a 10 for me, it was it's intensity and unpredictability. There is one qualm i have though, and that would be the plot device of the \"rule breaker\". not to spoil too much, but it basically allows one of the characters to skirt the rules. Which makes total nonsense because it basically defeats the purpose of the damn grail war. But anyways, story-wise it works well both alone, and in conjunction with fate/Zero\\n\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\nHOLY CRAP. the jokes about UBW standing for \"unlimited budget works\" was not a joke. this anime has one of the best animations, art, and fluidity i have ever seen. it makes every other 10 i've given for art meaningless. Lets go first art and design. its amazing. period. no half-assing anywhere. every shot, every scene is consistent with the last. there is no cutting corners here. The art is literally the most life-like art ever. Secondly, animation. Its also top notch. characters move fluidly, they fit with the scenery, nothing is choppy or jerky. again the word here is \"lifelike\". And i had to add this, but background details. The attention to detail is freaking amazing. even small things like people fighting in rain, snow, or animation of clouds going across a sky are all extremely well done and its clear to see that the production group gave 110%. No joke. it's insane. \\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nNot a big fan of OP/ED songs, or the sort of person who pays attention to background music. its alright. nothing amazing. nothing subpar either. it's just a very solid music score. It didn't make me notice it, so not very fond of it. The song's didn't make me want to listen to them again, nor did the in anime music catch my attention. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:8\\n\r\nWould have given it a 7 just because of how idiotic Shirou is, but felt that that would be biased. Anyways, Character-wise it was decent. There is alot of development, and none of the main characters are flat. Seriously not bad. But I gave it an 8, why? well two things. Shirou and Shinji. literally the worst characters ever. Shirou's always getting in the way of his own goals for 75% of the story, and Shinji is just a sore loser cunt. Shirou goes through character development which is his only redeeming quality, but still... why spend so much time doing that?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nDespite the weak characters, I enjoyed this anime immensely. it was such a welcome change to the mediocre F/SN. It had an amazing story, stunning art, and really those two things were conducive to my enjoyment. Also it was a fitting end to F/Zero. It didn't have my favorite category (ecchi), nor was it uncensored, but it was still enjoyable for it's intense battle scenes, good story. etc.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9\\n\r\nIt really is an amazing anime. Story-wise it was intense.  It had the \"wow\" factor just as much as it had the \"oh sh*t went down\" vibe. it was dark, dystopian, but also mysterious, a real journey filled with enjoyable plot. Art was above anything I've ever seen. Superior to any anime in all aspects. again it rewrites what i thought was possible for anime artistically. Characters were all very cool, not bad, though some had grating personalities. And thats where the one point comes of overall. its just the characters. They're great, and fit with the story, but theyre just not a personal favorite. So in short, id say 3 for story +4 for Art + 2 for enjoyment = 9 overall\\n\\n\r\nPeace",

            "content": "While i liked the first half the season but then the second half starts and i am very conflicted towards it. Instead of talking about the animation and soundeffects i want to talk more about the problems that i see in the second half.\r\nProblem 1: Visual novel sickness\r\nUnlimited blade works is the second route in the Fate Stay Night visual novel and therefore it is clear that some characters does not get any screentime while others get plenty of it. The transition from the novel to the anime is a painful one, Saber for example is such victim. If you came from FateZero and neverread the novel you will see the difference where she is standing in the background but if you have read the novel you know why. \\n\\n\r\nShirou and Archer gets plenty of time since this is their route while Rin gets to be the helpless girl in the second half of the show and does not contribute too much. Therefore the anime on its own cannot stand on its two legs if you are watching this without any knoledge about the novel itself.\\n\\n\r\nProblem 2: heavy dialogue \\n\\n\r\nIn the second half the dialogue is very heavy, dialogue between Archer and Shirou is a pure example. Episode 19 och 20 is almost delicated to the dialogue where Shirou and Archer exchanges their point of view when it comes to justice and ideals. The problem with this is that it is not very complex dialogue but it is dragged out for no reason and it slows the action down, something that Ufotable is known for. Almost every episode feels like a drag when it comes to dialogue. This is holy grail war not some talkshow about ideals. Sure, FateZero had also this kind of dialogue between Saber and Kiritsugu but it felt more integrated within the context and it did not take up the entire episode.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nDialogue heavy second half slows the show down and also contributes to its pacing issues. Battles are great when they take place but you need patience until then. I can understand both Shirou and Archers motives but if you repeat them several times over and over again then it becomes dull and somewhat stupid.\\n\\n\r\nSecond half is worth watch but be warned that you need some patience to finish it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is a review for both the first and this second season of Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works. First fo all, I have to say that I watch the STUDIO DEEN version of Fate/Stay Night, which was based on the FATE route of the visual novel of the same name. I have also watched the anime movie UNLIMITED BLADE WORKS, so my praise for this anime will be influenced a bit having seen those versions of it before watching this. (Note: that I also watched Fate/Zero before this too, but it won't have any particular influence over it.)\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nEvery since the highly spoken of disasterthat was STUDIO DEEN's Fate/Stay Night adaptation, I've been obsessed with the idea of this story. So much potential, a beautiful idea in my opinion. Having seen STUDIO DEEN's version first, I didn't think it was bad at all, in fact I gave it an 8 overall. BUt this ufotable 2nd route adaptation fo the visual novel gave me everything I wanted for such a story that I had become to love the idea of. It did excellent in all the criteria given for me to rate this by and I will elaborate more about it in each. As for the story, as I said, it gave me exactly what I wanted.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's quite obvious that the art is spectacular. One does not simply watch this anime in low-ass quality video played on the internet, you need blu-ray quality!!! LOL beautiful art, sceneic, almost realistic settings, the lighting in each scene perfectly reflects the mood of night and day, of light and shadow.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIntense, sad, reflected, sinister and more when it is needed to be so at the right moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat I love the most about this one is the character development. It is possible that if I hadn't seen STUDIO DEEN's creations I might have known less about the characters, such as the RIDER of this war, but I feel they touched on areas that were never touched on in STUDIO DEEN's version, but that's perhaps due to the fact that this is a different route than the other. The delved into the back stories of many characters, both master AND servants. I really appreciated that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDuh! Plus I had been waiting for this for quite a long time. It met my expectations too. I love it!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10 HELL YEAH!",

This is commonly used on someone\u2019s weapon during a battle to help the viewer better keep track of an AMAZINGLY beautiful fight scene. Which is the next point, amazing fight scenes. Each fight scene is beautifully crafted and all are equally purposeful.\r\nThe story is very well done, with each episode ending perfectly, some episodes even follow a lengthened form of approximately 47 minutes vs the normal 23 minute length. The story perfectly captures character and relationship development throughout the Anime. The Animealso delves into each character\u2019s unique and compelling back story, the Anime shows both back stories of main, sub, characters that both live and die. Allowing every viewer to develop an emotional connection with each and every character including the servants themselves.\\n\\n\r\nNot only the characters but their interactions feel fully fleshed out and for the most part organic and true to the personalty of each character.\\n\\n\r\nFinally to the end of the Anime. The ending is a satisfying yet open ended finish to the Anime. It both left it open to sequels and left the viewer feeling resolution of the story.\\n\\n\r\nWith every masterpiece there are small hiccups, which disqualify them from being a prefect masterpiece. With this Anime, however there was little to be picky about. Although there were a few characters which needed more attention and fleshing out. All in all a true masterpiece and a MUST WATCH for anyone wanting an amazing action filled Anime that boasts the highest quality. This Anime deserves my rating score of 10: Epic Masterpiece.",

            "content": "Let me start off with: fuck Shirou...and Archer was right. Seriously just fuck Shirou Emiya. He is the biggest fucking retard in any anime I have ever watched. And he should have listened to Archer.\r\nAnyway, the characters were great, minus the red-headed dipshit, the art was outstanding, and it was a very riveting story, that made you always either tense, laughing, or nodding my head in approval. The Holy Grail itself was not explained very well, however, and explanation thrown in at the last couple episodes, which builds on Fate/Zero, so you almost have to watch that first. You should watch it first anyway justfor the backstory and the awesomeness of Alexander the Great.\\n\\n\r\n**SPOILERS**\\n\r\nThe holy grail was kind of just a hole in the sky that bled...and made a fleshy mountain that was a monster...I guess. And it didn't grant wishes it kinda just murdered the fuck out of whoever touched the blood/magic curse water that flowed out of it. And it basically made no sense. but it looked cool.\\n\\n\r\nShirou is Archer but Archer is so much better in every way. Shirou pissed me off so much. If you know your path is going to make you a miserable, murdering (although badass), eternal assassin slave for \"the world\", then you might wanna change that. Especially if your future self is even willing to kill his past and erase himself to change his future. That is a huge hint towards \"Don't choose this path it will fuck you so bad\", and he even tells him that the people he chooses to fight for betray him and hang him and then when he becomes a guardian to protect, \"the world\" just has him slaughter people that will drastically change or endanger humanity. Btw where the fuck was \"the world\" as far as hitler was concerned but anyway. Still. Who in the fuck just says \"I dont care.\" when they are told all that shit. So much character problems and stupidity when it comes to Shirou.\\n\\n\r\nAlso he is passive agressive with Rin...like just fucking kiss her or sleep with her or both jesus christ they live together for fucks sake and both admitted they like eachother. Its like he is a mostly emotionless robot unless he is fighting. Fucking bullshit.",

Take that however you want. \r\nFate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works came out of the gate with an extremely strong first 2 episodes. The artistic direction and timing was promising a very cool perspective based death gamethat showed multiple angles of the same events from different characters perspectives. However after those first 2 special long episodes the series walks away form that angle completely.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals were quite impressive at times with some nice environments and pretty good fighting shots. The show was riddled with terrible CG liquid and fire that really contrasted poorly against the 2d portions of the same scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack felt very generic and if I have to hear a stock frying pan/sheers cutting sound one more time I may go insane. First seasons OP was good though.\\n\\n\r\nThe gripes I had with the characterization and narration of Fate/Zero were only amplified here with the absence of Emiya Kiritsugu. Characters were fairly flat and one-note and the dialogue absolutely drowned out all the fun the fight scenes were providing me. The Caster class Heroic Spirit and Master were actually interestingly characterized and made me seriously question how they were dealt with by our protagonists. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know if this sort of anime just doesn't appeal to me or if this anime was genuinely bad with constant use of Deus Ex Machina, Narration that doesn't actually explain anything, and monologues about ideals that are so backwards in logic that I had to legitimately wonder if the translation team wasn't fundamentally screwing something up or just playing a prank on me.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't like it, but something about Fate wants me to watch more of it's other properties. Does that mean it's doing something right? I honestly don't know.",

            "content": "Production and Popularity\r\nThe second season continues the story of Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade works, based on the 2010 movie of the same name and the 2006 Fate/Stay Night series. These were all based on the original FSN Visual novel by Type Moon. The animation studio was again Ufotable. Compared to the first season, which was rated 8.41 by 175 thousand voters, the second season is even more overwhelmingly popular, 8.71 by 230 thousand voters. Although relatively few people bothered to rate FSN:UBW on IMDb or Crunchyroll, the average is still 8.1 out of 10, and 4.5 stars out of 5, respectively. Genres and themes includeaction, fantasy, supernatural, thriller, psychological, personal value systems, loyalty, friendship, and battle royale.  \\n\\n\r\nStory Structure\\n\\n\r\nAs usual in my reviews, I want to note the story composition used, as someone interested in the structure of good storytelling in media. The plot can be interpreted several ways. If the story of the Holy Grail War, the action, is thought of as the central plot, the structure is as follows. Major plot points are the fight with Caster in episode 1, seeing the fate of Illya in episode 3, defeating Caster in episode 5, Archer's past, fighting Archer, and Archer's fate in episodes 7-9, and the final battle stretched over episodes 11 and 12. Season one used a 1-3-6-8-10-12 plot point format, and season two is similar if you think of it as 1-3-5-7-9-12. A lot of things happens from 6 to 9 that are part of the same \"Arc\" of the revealing of Archer's past, his intentions, and his fight with Shirou. That accounts for the slight difference in story structure. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot can also be thought of as the story of Shirou's personal journey. That journey had three parts in season one and four parts in season two. The climaxes for Shirou are confessing to Rin in episode 1, having his ideals challenged by Rin in episode 4, reaffirming his ideals in the fight with Archer by episode 8 or 9, and becoming a hero and survivor of the Holy Grail War in episode 12. This 1-4-9-12 structure is excellently designed for showing the progress of Shirou's character. The epilogue, episode 13, is also important, as it discusses his future with Rin. Later on, I will discuss Shirou's personal journey in more detail. My only complaints about the story were a) that it was somewhat predictable, and b) that it echoed anime where characters had similar journeys as Shirou, such Sayaka in Madoka Magica and Akane in Psycho-Pass.\\n\\n\r\nArt Overall \\n\\n\r\nPlease see my review of the first season for more detail on my thoughts of the art. As with season one, FSN:UBW delivers a high-quality experience for the senses. It's beautiful and colorful. The animation of the fight scenes is excellent, though I personally would have liked to see some more realistic, rather than explosive and fantastical, battles. The character designs are unforgettable, but it seems to me that more thought is put into the colors and powers of the characters than to their individual expressions. The range of expression is somewhat limited.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: Acting, Songs, and OST\\n\\n\r\nFSN:UBW features the voices of Kana Ueda as Rin, Noriaki Sugiyama as Shirou, and Junichi Suwabe as Archer, among others. The performances were more than satisfactory, though nothing truly unforgettable. Please see my review of the first season of FSN:UBW for more information on the seiyuu. The popular voice actor Hiroshi Kamiya makes a minor appearance as Shinji Matou. Even with such a small role, he does an impressive job.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the soundtrack was memorable. Opening theme \"Brave Shine\" by Aimer is even better than season one's opening in my opinion. Aimer has since become known in the anime industry for performing various other songs, such as the ED for Zankyou no Terror, Koutetsujou Kabaneri, and one of the many ending songs in Bleach. Ending theme \"Ring your Bell\" by Yuki Kajiura was just as great. Ms. Kajiura is a singer/song-writer who has performed music in anime such as Pandora Hearts, Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero, and Boku Dake ga Inai Machi (\"Erased\"). \"Ring your Bell is an upbeat and inspiring song.  \\n\\n\r\nThe OST for FSN:UWB 2nd Season was again composed by Hideyuki Fukasawa. The 24 tracks in the OST II are beautiful. A few of them seem to lack originality, but all of them are high quality nonetheless. Memorable tracks include \"Illyasviel von Einzbern,\" a pretty and somewhat creepy melody, \"Ideal/Betrayal,\" and \"This Illusion,\" used for discussions and flashbacks of Archer's past, \"Excalibur,\" an epic, thematic score, and \"Emiya UBW,\" the exciting, upbeat, yet emotional theme for Shirou once he has come to terms with his conflicts.  While I watched the actual anime, very few of these stuck out of me, but whenever I listen to the OST II, I am always impressed. (A short piece that I did notice while watching was \"Fictional Heroic Spirit,\" used for the Assassin character who guards Caster's temple.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters Overall\\n\\n\r\nVirtually FSN:UBW characters are memorable, and in the second season, some of the one-dimensional ones receive their much-needed attention. And example is Caster, who didn't have much of a personality in the first season, but who showed her true values and intentions (largely through flashbacks) in the second installment. Some characters where expanded on, but not enough, such as Saber (I wanted to know more about her thoughts and personal journey) and Assassin (I would have liked at least half an episode about him). Once again, Saber's outstanding morality and chivalry make her admirable to lovers of classic heroes, while rough and rugged Archer gives fans a more human hero with a dark side. Archer gets a lot of development in the second season and I think the series did a great job with him. \\n\\n\r\nAs with the first season, I believe Rin and Shirou are rare and much-needed types of protagonists in anime. Shirou represents the selfless yet deeply flawed hero-to-be, and Rin is a breath of fresh air as a strong, talented, and outspoken female hero. For more detail on these characters, please see my review of FSN:UBW Season One.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Notes on Shirou's Story\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of FSN:UBW 2nd Season was higher than what I experienced in the first season, which is why I rated the first season 7 (good) and the second season 8 (very good). I found some events predictable, and I thought that other things weren't made clear enough. I was also disappointed not to see more about Saber's personal journey, and to be honest I wanted a little more romance between Shirou and Rin. There was much less discussion of the truth of what the Holy Grail really is, and the ending for the over-powered villain seemed a little too convenient. The thing I enjoyed most about the series was the story of Shirou\u2019s personal journey, which is discussed below. (As spoiler-free as possible.) \\n\\n\r\nAmong vocal fans on crunchyroll and gogoanime, Shirou is far from being the most well-liked character. Complaints about him are that he is too soft-hearted, that his stubbornness makes him stupid, and that he is too much of a dreamy idealist. Though it may not be the fan favorite, I believe it is meaningful to have heroes like this (every now and then) in anime, because whether they admit it or not, many people have been through the same mental stages as Shirou. If Shirou was annoying to me, it's because he reminded me too much of myself. I'll bet I'm not the only one who thinks this. \\n\\n\r\nHis is a classic story. Without much else to base his unsteady identity on, Shirou devotes himself to his values, which are idealistic and not really feasible in the real world, and which tend to break a person in the end. He wishes to save everybody even at the expense of himself and his soul. While Shirou is the idealistic child, Archer is like the disillusioned adult, and that's why he is more popular. Nobody likes to remember how stupid they were when thought like Shirou. We prefer to think of ourselves as Archers, stuck in an unfair system, and betrayed by our values until we become skeptical, regret-filled, and emotionally distant characters. For some people, the journey ends there. And in indeed, even in the series, we are certainly not guaranteed a happy future for Archer. But note the significance of the conclusion Shirou draws in his fight with Archer. \\n\\n\r\nShirou acknowledged that most of what Archer said was true. However, the thing that re-inspired him to keep going with values was the memory that he has known all along he would be walking into a living hell. From early childhood, Shirou walks through figurative hell, fully knowing what it is, and still looking for people to save. Archer simply forgot that he had committed to such a fate from the beginning; he got caught up in the hypocrisy of having to kill people to save other people. Shirou was made aware of the \"save many at the cost of the few\" problem, and he decides to continue regardless. \"Even if that life is that of a machine,\" he says, \"even if that life is dripping with hypocrisy, I'll keep striving to be Seigi no Mikata (ally/hero of justice).\" \\n\\n\r\nVery few people have the determination to stick to their values even knowing that it will result in intense, possibly lifelong, suffering. This is what makes Shirou an incredible person. Certainly, there are those who simply consider him foolish, and I think so myself sometimes, but anyone who once swore themselves to their values will see the honor and courage in trying to stick to those values regardless of the outcome.",

            "content": "This is a review from someone who DID NOT read the visual novel, and watched Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Zero and Unlimited Blade Works in this order.\r\nAt 1st, I imagine this would be just like Fate/Stay Night with a Rin route, but it turns out completely different from the 2006 anime. Aside from episode 1, its a totally different story. I still recommend watching it so you can get a better understanding of the whole story. And please, watch Fate/Zero before watching UBW.\r\nI could say the initial catch about this show is the animation. Its basically top notch, its so good that makes you wonder how muchmoney was put into it. Fights are fantastic, the effects of lightning and shadows are perfect, the characters look awesome. Its unfair to compare UBW and SN, it would only be fair with Zero, and its still a lot superior.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the show has 2 problems: pacing and wasted romantic potential. About pacing, you have incredible \"fast\" episodes where a lot of stuff happens and it seems rushed, while others are a lot slower. And about romance, its always implied that they love each other and eventually have a serious relationship, but again, its ONLY IMPLIED. I don't know about you, but that utherly pisses me off. In every romance story, you watch the whole thing waiting for that one special moment, and when it never happens, I feel like I was fooled the entire time.\\n\r\nAlso on this subject, Shirou feels like an emotionless doll all the time. Even he says that he likes he, his expression doesnt demonstrate that it all. Aside from helping and saving her, he does nothing to express his feelings, what makes his \"love\" sound weird and superficial. Rin is way more expressive.\\n\\n\r\nYou have fantastic animation and fighting scenes, a whole new approach to the Fate world and Shirou turns out pretty badass in the end, almost redeeming himself from being an loveless doll. Sadly, I regret that some characters were forgotten midway through the show. Overall, a very entertaining show. Just a few changes from being perfect.",

The GLORIOUS artwork, animation and soundtracks easily put it among my top 3 favorite anime series in this decade!\r\nMy favorite character is Archer: the unique design, the calmness, the no-nonsense attitude, the sarcasm, cynicism, assessments of others, and even \"old-man talk\" (haha). I love every fight that Archer engages in in this anime. Even though he's not a 5-star Servant in terms of power, he manages to pull win after win against tough opponents by utilizing tactics --He's a symbol of \"trying your best\".\\n\\n\r\nI must say, watching Ufotable's adaptation is much more satisfying than reading the VN, because I get to see the most fantastic, epic, eye-pleasing battles that one can ever see in the anime world. I also get to see the characters' movements and interactions - which I can only imagine in my head when reading the VN. I also am extremely pleased to see that Ufotable's adaptation stay faithful to the original VN work! Although all internal monologues are cut out, the anime - through its amazing animation - successfully conveys all the subtleties in the ways the characters interact and fight.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no other company that I would entrust this franchise to. I am looking forward to Ufotable's adaption of Fate/Stay Night: Heaven's Feel. I also hope that they will adapt Fate/Hollow Ataraxia soon!\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite OST is EMIYA theme ! Absolutely epic!",

            "content": "First of all, I have not read the visual novels and am not a Fate franchise fan. I've heard its name a lot and decided to give a shot for it. I watched Fate/Zero, then Unlimited Blade Works.\r\nNo spoiler review.\r\nStory 6:\r\nI honestly think the story has good ideas, however I think they are poorly executed. Since I came after watching Fate/zero, there were less twists involved, but still it had pretty decent ideas. However pacing, especially between the first and the second season, is quite bad. It is not that it is boring, it's just that they spend screen time on things that don't needthat much screen time.\\n\r\nAnd some moments of the plot is downright not working. I had particular difficulty watching \"yet again saved by the character X at the last moments\", after a certain point they stopped making any sense.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9:\\n\r\nI am not an artist but I enjoyed what I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8:\\n\r\nIt contributed to the overall \"epic\" feeling of the show pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4:\\n\\n\r\nI think the main characters are ok, except shirou. However the show does a lot of injustice to side characters, and there were number of them which had enormous potential to be entertaining. You might think that this injustice doesn't enough to grade as 4. I believe it does because when you have 7 masters and thus 7 servants that you can introduce and develop, if you are introducing only three or four of them in the same fashion throughout the story, that's simply poor character developpement. It doesn't really matter how well you do with the already introduced four, well it does, but part of the reason I am grading this so low is that I don't believe that the protagonists are properly introduced.\\n\r\nRin was ok in my opinion, she didn't change much, but she didn't need to change much as well. \\n\r\nSaber was humiliated in my opinion. One of the reasons why I graded high Fate/Zero was their capacity to portray a strong woman with no apparent weakness. This was not the case in this one. \\n\r\nArcher, was real and comprehensible, but a little repetitive.\\n\r\nShirou, was mediocre. I would like him if it was not for the last episodes or two. Towards the ending his epiphany moments ceased to be enlightening. He simply repeated what he had said two episodes ago. His whole attitude can be summed up as \"I know I am stupid, but...\" which is kind a okay for 1 or 2 times, but it can not be the driving cause of the character developpement.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6:\\n\r\nI got bored towards the ending, but it was not soooo bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6:\\n\r\nBesides the character developpement, it was kind of a good show, but could have been way better.",

            "content": "The highly acclaimed Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works is back!  Before I get started, I'm right this review having watched Fate/Stay Zero and not Fate/Stay night (2006).  Obviously, since this is a sequel, this anime would be crippled as a stand-alone, and I highly recommend you see the first season before starting this.\r\nStory: Adequate Enough\r\nFirst of all, compared to all the other branches of the Fate/Stay franchise, this anime by far, best explores the fate universe and the Servant and Master mechanics, especially the mechanics.  This anime goes as far as to explain how nothing in this universe is set in stone:the hidden secrets of the Grail and its counterparts, the conditions pertaining to servant and master, and the limits of mana.  However, this is where the story makes its sacrifices.  To explain the greater scope of the story, the plot suffers greatly.  Potential plot lines are abridged, or avoided altogether.  Potential supporting character developments are cut short when, excuse the minor spoiler, the story decides to kill off a character to avoid another story and refocus the plot revolving around our two unreliable protagonists.  I understand that the anime is based on a VN, with multiple story plots, but that does give an excuse for the anime to rush to its plot.\\n\r\nArt: Outstanding\\n\r\nDo i need to say more?  Why is this anime called Unlimited Blade Works instead of Unlimited Budget Works?  The animation by ufotable is as astonishing as ever.  Every action scene involving the Servants were very entertaining to watch and the motions flowed through wonderfully.  Even the Masters, whose powers were not as overwhelming as their servant's, came to life in their battle scenes.  Outside the action, character designs were on point, and the scenery: I paused a few times to enjoy the beautiful view.  Keep it up ufotable!\\n\r\nCharacter: Fair\\n\r\nTo be blunt, it's no surprise to anyone that a Servant's existence is temporal and a tool to advance the plot to its grandiose ending.  Because of that, we don't know much about each Servan't backstory or their historic upbringing, except those who manage to survive until the near end.  To give credit, the demise of a couple, specific servants really does delve deep into the reasons of their actions and personality.  The supporting cast did not really leave much of an impression and there simply wasn't enough time to learn about the other masters.  But to be fair, the most important character development belongs our protagonists: Emiya Shirou and Tohsaka Rin. As I mentioned before, these two are unreliable protagonists and complicates this already intricate anime.  These two behave as polar opposites consistently throughout the anime, and by the end, establish a strong relationship.\\n\r\nOverall: Ehh, not bad\\n\r\nWhat this anime has going for itself is its excellent animation and reputation based on its franchise.  It's like someone had an immense imagination but only had one canvas to paint it. I enjoyed this anime and would recommend it to others, but I can not disregard its lacking details.\\n",

            "content": "I will get straight into the point. I felt that everything about this season of the anime was great such as the music, visuals etc. The story itself has always been solid but the thing that has held back the two seasons were a few characters with one being the main man Shirou himself. His character is so poorly written, very annoying and has dumb ideals and sometimes says stuff so unbearable to watch which i wont mention due to spoilers. However some parts of his story were great which was near the end but it doesn't stop me from feeling bored and frustrated wheneveri see him. I know its only one flaw im talking about but this specific point is what i feel holds back the series unlike Fate/Zero. Other than him, there are others like Shinji but he's a minor so its alright. There are good and very cool/likable characters but again i dont want to spoil anything. On the postive the fight scenes were incredible and stunning and the opening is arguably one of the best i've seen. Despite the weak main character Shriou, i still found Fate UBW awesome and exciting to watch but i just wanted to explain my one frustration of the series. \\n\\n\r\ni would give this an 8.5 btw.",

This time Shiro went ahead and actually loculated the gap left in the first adaptation, showing how far he was shaped by his misinterpretation of how and to be a hero, from his father. The story of the Archer also helped make the character much more mature, and much deeper, thus giving a sort of \"reality clash\" in whatwas a personification of his [Archer] father with his [idealistic] personality.\\n\\n\r\nThis adaptation really is a remedy to forget his first, so we can see how Kiritsugu [the best character in the franchise, in my opinion] was important, being a hero not legendary, who ended up personified in the person of the Archer, who by End, ended up getting into friction with his ideal in the form of the wandering Shiro. Really a very dignified series. Although this adaptation has its shortcomings, development compared to the first is much better. Fate / Zero for me is the best Fate of all, and my personal reference.",

            "content": "This will be a review for S1 and S2, since I watched this as a whole. There might be some spoilers so you are warned.\r\nOther point before I start is that my review is based only on the anime versions, I never read any of the VN or played the games related to the Fate universe. That being so, let's start.\r\nI have to say that during the time I was watching this I was really hooked to it, I watched it all almost in one go, and I liked so much that I gave it a 9/10 score. \r\nAt the time that I'm writing thisreview it's been some months, and I have to say that now I would lower my score to a 7/10 just because there are moments in the story that are quite forgetful. That's not what you want from a great anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story leads us to a world where everything is set in motion for the Holy Grail War, we have our main character Emiya Shirou, a high school student that is somehow dragged into this world of magic and servants. There are seven masters for seven servants from seven different classes: Saber, Archer, Lancer, Rider, Caster, Assassin and Berserker. Each of the seven masters will fight each other in order to gain the Holy Grail. Shirou, however is the type of selfless person that makes a lot of mistakes and puts himself in danger when there were other ways of dealing with the problems, he want to be the hero of justice and that's great and all, but sometimes he's just stupid. That is what happens in most of S1, Shirou doing everything he can to save everyone, bu putting everyone in danger. \\n\r\nS2 I have to say that I really liked the way it turned out. In this season there is a big twist regarding Archer, that somehow made this into a great show for me. That was a surprise and the one thing i will remember from this show.\\n\r\nI was a great ending and just for that I would recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is just amazing, it's really really good, specially in the fight scenes. The backgrounds are detailed and always add to the feeling of the show. The animation if fluid, the colors are on point, really nothing bad to say here. The fight scenes are just amazing, probably the best ones I've seen in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is quite good also. The opening of S1 is very good, usually I skip the Op, but I was listening to this one. The Eds are not so memorable, but still in accordance to the show. \\n\r\nThe background music was also very good, adding to the feeling of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the difficult part here, since the most memorable ones are not the main ones. Emiya Shirou and Thonsaka Rin are our main characters, I liked Rin in the beginning, she looked like a strong and independent girl that could handle herself well, but after some interaction with Shirou she starts to feel more like a damsel in distress then what I though. \\n\r\nFor me the best characters are Saber and Archer, specially Archer, he really comes a long way, and in the end is the main protagonist in this whole story, at least in my opinion. Saber is Shirou's Servant and she's a bad ass. Like Archer, she's the one that ends up doing everything to save the masters in distress. \\n\r\nThe other Servants are also very good, just wished there was more development there. Also from the other masters. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the show, it's a nice take on good vs evil, and on how to keep sacrificing yourself for other leads to people taking advantage of you. I would recommend Fate/stay nigh Unlimited blade works to fans of this genre, if you like good animated fights and if you like anime that have a ending, as in you feel like it's over.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Now I have watched plenty of anime in my time, and while this is not my absolute favorite, it has made it into my top five. A little background, I tried to watch Fate/Zero but it was hard to get into in the first few episodes, based on the fact that I can be a simple anime fan. I like to know who the main characters are and what they go up against. In Fate/Zero, there were simply so many characters to keep track of that it was confusing to say the least. \r\nBut onto Unlimited Blade Works . . . I loved this show.Not only did it have great art and animation, the story line was strong as well. The whole dynamic of Rin and Shirou fighting together, with Archer and Saber and Lancer even, was just fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nNot only was this anime visually appealing, but it was emotionally appealing as well. The entire fight between Archer and Shirou was more than just a flashy piece of great animation, it expressed a battle of will and a determination to accomplish a goal even knowing the outcome. That sequence of episodes was some of the greatest symbolic piece I have ever seen in an anime. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed it, I would have to agree that it is not perfect. My biggest concern was Rin and Shirou's relationship. I believe they probably could have played this factor more, even though it was not a romance anime. Also I would have liked more clarification at the end to end the romance part on a high note. Another discrepancy is Kirei's part in this, he seemed to be a major villain throughout the entire series and is finished off very quickly.\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 9/10 with great animation, story line, likable characters, and underlying meaning as well. It reached my top 5 anime and will most likely stay there for a while.",

            "content": "gg ufotable, you blew us away with Season 2 (sort of)\r\nSTORY- 7/10\r\nStory-wise it got better, with the twists at the beginning of the season being vital to the rest of the plot. Gilgamesh looks even cooler in UBW than he did in Fate/Zero, we get some interesting backstories and more character development, nice job UBW. Shirou still says weird stuff (\"Just because you're correct doesn't mean you're right!\"), but he's better than last season LOL.\r\nART- 10/10\r\nWell yes, the art does go down a bit in quality later on in the season, but then you should look at DEEN's movie adaption of UBW and you'd seewhy this still deserves a 10. The Archer vs Lancer rematch was godly though, won't deny that.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND- 9/10\\n\r\nWell, turns out that Yuki Kajiura helped out with the music (something I missed last season), and after watching DEEN's adaption, I must say that the music is pretty good. And of course, the Fate veterans have been voice-acting this one for a while now, so their voices are on point. Once again, this score was influenced by the godly Archer vs Lancer rematch.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER- 7/10\\n\r\nHOORAY SHIROU ISN'T A COMPLETE IDIOT ANYMORE WOOHOO CELEBRATE. Yeah, Shirou gets some development, Rin kinda goes Tsundere but it doesn't affect the general plot too much. Saber is less of a mindless fighter and Archer is as badass as ever. Lancer turns out to be a cool guy too. Shinji is kinda stupid though, but he was always stupid.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT- 8/10\\n\r\nUnlimited Budget Works still failed to disappoint me while watching it. I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire show, even if the story and character departments were still kinda weak.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL- 8/10\\n\r\nNice follow-up to the first season, definitely recommend to all anime viewers to at least watch the fight scenes if nothing else.",

            "content": "I don't know about you guys, but I really enjoyed this 2nd season.\r\nStory: This season picks up right where the first left off, with the same style from the first season, which really helped this season. The build ups for the major battles were well done in my opinion, and really helped shape the characters. Although, I did find that the first half of this season was more of plot in order to kill off some people. That allowed the rest of the plot to advance so that conflicts would arise leading to the final battle in the end of this season. Now, onto thebattles. The battle between Archer 1 and Emiya was amazing, showcasing not only the quality animation from ufotable, but also the character's struggles and failed realisations. This really helped the characters, which was a bit lacking in the first season. But what really shines is the final battle, where Emiya not only becomes a badass, but he also comes to terms with his path in life. Overall, the story was much better in my opinion, but the first half could have been refined some more. Oh, one last thing. The only thing I'd like to have known, although stupid, is what Rin and Emiya had to miss in class due to this war. The thoughts seem stupid, but it's a genuine question of \"How much class did they miss?\".\\n\\n\r\nArt: If you watched the first season, you'd already know how great the art was. For a deeper review on it, just read my review on Fate UBW S1. Anyways, the art in this season is basically the same, although now sporting some cleaner looks due to it being much newer, and probably with a higher budget. Art in battles are still great, and although shading is a bit lacking, the colors help make up for that. Art overall was an improvement.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Honestly, this category is the same as my season 1 review too, so I'll just summarise. Voice acting is still amazing, as always, and background music is really what sets the mood no matter where the characters are. The opening is still great, although I prefer the first one a bit more, but the ending is something that I personally liked more in this season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: In the first season, the characters were pretty static, not really having much influence or change. But in this season, the characters all really come to life. Emiya is still an inexperienced kid who is fueled by a desire, but everything in between is filled in with this season. Without getting into spoilers, he finally does find out why he wants to continue his path of a hero of justice. Now, onto Rin. Rin is still your classic tsundere, but her ability to be rational and to give Emiya the straight answer is what sets apart her personality from the first season. No longer is she focused on an alliance that was to be broken off after Caster was defeated, but now this alliance has changed to something that doesn't want to be broken. Rin changes tp a character that I can like even more with the developments from this season. The last character I'd like to talk about before this section gets too long is Archer. I can't say his name without getting into spoilers, but Archer's ideals are and were the exact same as Emiya's. Now, Archer is still a supporting character, so he doesn't go through any actual change. However, Archer provides Emiya with the vital question that asks him why he wants to be a hero of justice. He then goes onto tell Emiya about what happens to people who try to live like how he envisioned, and I found this to really make Emiya more enjoyable, but also Archer, as you now can find out what Archer's \"regrets\" are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Making this simple, I really enjoyed UBW. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: UBW itself did have some problems, but they were minor in my opinion. I felt as if this was a solid series, and every episode had something in store. Hell, even the epilogue had something in store, hinting at something that could very well be a sequel with future Emiya. My thoughts on this show make me question why some people hate this season, but hey, that's what I get for enjoying everything. If you remove the hype that was with this show, like I did, you can watch this without the high expectation that the community gave, and use whatever expectation you had. To wrap things up, UBW was really good, and I feel that it's one of my favourite series now.",

However, when that plot twist hit (which I will not reveal so that I can keep this spoiler free), my interest immediately peaked again.\r\nAs someone who watched the original 2006 Fate/stay night anime, I was sort of biased and predispositioned to prefer the chain of events in the Fate route. Although, I really enjoyed the ending of this anime overall, especially when I started making my own theories about how everything fit together. In fact, I liked it so much thatmy rating bumped from a 6 to a 9. Also, getting to know Archer in place of Saber in this route as opposed to the Fate route was very, very nice.\\n\\n\r\nI mean, I don't know what else to say. I gave a pretty in depth review about my feelings regarding the Fate route vs. the UBW route on the UBW season 1 page, so go check that out if you want to know my thoughts. \\n\\n\r\nI guess I'm going to close this out by saying... No offense, Rin, but Saber and Shirou will always be my main Fate/stay night OTP. Fight me.",

You can tell when they want to have a proper intermission and when they just want to milk a show to death by cutting it half. \"Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works\" is not one of those shows. \r\nOkay, maybe they DO want to milk the franchise, but they succeeded in providing one of the better Season 2 experiences in recent memory. Returning from when where they left off, the action resumes quickly while resting only to provide more character backstories in a way that adds to the action and doesn't simply feel likefiller. They answered questions I wanted to know.\\n\\n\r\nThe story finally proceeds to an exciting, spectacular conclusion that will leave most fans feeling super satisfied, (I know I was) and then give you a cool down epilogue entry that is a bit tedious to sit through after the roller coaster you've just been on. I give this show (particularly this season) high marks across the board for story, art, sound, and voice acting. I voted the last season's Sub vs. Dub battle to the Dub, but it's so close again I'll give this one to the Sub. Both casts did an outstanding job.\\n\\n\r\nThis series in it's entirety serves as a worthy sequel to \"Fate/Zero\" and stands as one of the best Fantasy/Action shows ever made. I binged right through Season 2 after I finished Season 1 and it was well worth it. A must watch for any Anime fan. 9/10. Check it out.",

Let me say that I\u2019ve always sucked at reviewing successive season to shows, because in my mind, if you didn\u2019t like the first season, why are you watching the sequel? Ask yourself that question whenever you\u2019re in that position.\r\nThe Short Version:\r\n(+)If you were a fan of S1, you\u2019ll like this season as well.\r\n(-)IF you don\u2019t like small changes being made from the visual novel, you\u2019re going to have a problem. \r\nThe Story (7/10): Picking up right where the previous season left us, this season doesn\u2019t exactly waste much time with kicking itself back intogear in the slightest. One of the things you might enjoy about this season over the first is that a little bit more backstory is given to the opponents than what was in S1. You come to understand them a bit better in terms of where they exactly stand and what their motivations are. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one thing a lot of people ragged on about when this show was airing, because 1. HOW DARE THEY DIVERT FROM THE SOURCE MATERIAL?! and 2. They didn\u2019t do the best job when it came to giving the characters some actual development past which Master had which Servant. As the little snippets we got felt very, very forced, but that\u2019s one of the problems you\u2019ll encounter when you adapt a single route of a visual novel that doesn\u2019t have a singular absolute end.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing worth mentioning in this season is the actually ending of the show, of which there are two depending on what suits your taste. Do you want the canonical? Or the ideal ending? Because they did a pretty good job of throwing both onto the screen, the former of which even manages to sneak in a little bit a character fanservice from Fate/Zero. One more point about this season is that it has what is undoubtedly one of the most brutal and unsettling deaths ever put to anime (That I know of).\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (7/10): The characters are mostly the same as in S1, with some more backstory given to the opponents as mentioned before, that and the show has a rather major character twist that you might\u2019ve figured out in S1 if you paid extra attention, if not, don\u2019t worry they make it painfully obvious without telling you until a little later.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound (8/10) & (8/10): Did you like the art in S1? It\u2019s pretty much the same with a mild amount of skimping on the budget in some parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is almost basically unchanged, although for the fans with sharp ears they\u2019ll notice a track from the previous Fate entries that has wonderfully been remastered.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you think of this anime?\\n\\n\r\n$260 Limited Edtion Blu-Ray Boxset. That should tell you.\\n\\n\r\nWould you recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nAs long as you\u2019ve watched S1, otherwise why the fuck are you starting with S2?\\n\\n\r\nGoodbye my brethren, see you in the next one.",
