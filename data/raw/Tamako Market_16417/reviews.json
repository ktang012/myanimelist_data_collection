            "content": "There's something about anime which allows us to derive entertainment from the mundane events of an ordinary person. Coincidentally, ordinary is the best way to describe Tamako Market. \r\nStarring the young lady Tamako and a flamboyant talking bird, Tamako Market is yet another anime that attempts to cash in on the slice of life phenomenon. It is not an anime that prospers through the strength of its plot, setting, or themes, but instead subsists through the cuteness of its characters. Should we criticize an anime for not going beyond that? Maybe not. But there is certainly a problem when such a simple anime still fallsshort of its potential. \\n\\n\r\nTamako Market's biggest weakness is regrettably its characterization. Each characters has about the same depth as wrapping paper, as none of them even once prove to be more than their established archetype. Tamako is merely your ordinary, dense heroine (think Chitanda with pigtails) who is no more memorable than any other generic slice-of-life lead. There is little to make her stand out aside from the fact that she is cute and naive. Even when the story shows small signs of her developing as a character, it will simply fall back on her denseness in order to prevent any growth. The result is not pleasant. You cannot have a character-driven slice-of-life anime told through the perspective of a weak character. It does not work. Though one might think: if not the protagonist, the rest of the cast may be better, right?\\n\\n\r\nNot here, it seems. For nearly all of the side characters are a superfluous addition to an already large cast. The biggest offenders are Tamako's school friends: Midori, Kanna, and Shiori. They do not serve any purpose but to quickly provide a sense of friendship in Tamako's daily life. While there are a couple of episodes that focus on these characters and attempt to give them personality, once the next episode starts, the show will treat it as if nothing even happened. This is especially an issue in the case of Shiori, where an entire episode is spent introducing her to Tamako's group of friends\u2014 yet afterwards she is not seen for almost the entire story. What was the point? You could remove these characters from the show and nothing would change. \\n\\n\r\nTamako's childhood friend, Mochizou, is yet another victim to the weak characterization. His character design at least carries some degree of promise, but the lack of screen time compounded with his unfortunate role as a plot device do not do him any favors. There are a few heartwarming scenes between him and Tamako, such as when they talk at night through a string telephone, but the overall execution of this romance is invariably poor. It is entirely composed of Mochizou woefully attempting to convey his feelings to no avail, with Tamako conveniently being blind to Mochizou's evident feelings. In many ways, their relationship is reminiscent of the cliches from harem anime. To be fair, this isn't a story that focuses on its romance. But can one forgive what could easily have been so much more?  \\n\\n\r\nThe show's mascot, Dera, will either amuse or infuriate you. Considering that he has more screentime than any other character in the story, this can potentially destroy any entertainment value that the show might otherwise hold for the viewer. There are a few witty moments here and there, but most often he is simply detracting from time that could have been better spent developing the human characters. While you may hate him, the one thing that can be said in his favor is that he creates personality within the show: he is anything but a bland character. Whether you lean towards hatred or endearment, Dera will leave some lasting impression on you by the end of the story. Hopefully a positive one. \\n\\n\r\nOn a more positive note is Tamako's younger sister, Anko. She does not receive much screentime in comparison to Tamako or Dera, but what little she receives is written considerably well. Her two episodes focus on the innocent crush that she has towards a classmate, and the way in which the anime conveys this is surprisingly subtle. Anko does not outright state her feelings, but through her body language they are made very clear to the viewer. As well as being sickeningly adorable, Anko is surprisingly the most believable character in the show. Too bad she is treated as irrelevant in all but two episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the characters and romance, there are small problems within the story itself. Most notably is during the last few episodes. After an abrupt twist at the end of the 10th episode, the show immediately tries to rush in some semblance of a story at which it fails quite miserably. Not only does this undermine the slice-of-life aspect of the previous episodes, but the writing is marred by contrivances such as when the Prince somehow travels (or is it 'teleports'?) from a distant country to appear at the most convenient time possible. The ending is scarcely better either as it completely disregards these events in order to revert back to the mundane slice of life. I am not sure that KyoAni knew what kind of anime they wanted to make with Tamako Market. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the content of the show feels uninspired, at least there is some charm in the presentation. There's an interesting contrast between the mundane activities of the shopping district and the unique carnival aesthetic they are presented in. The soundtrack compliments the style of the show especially well, while even the shopkeepers and background characters are given distinct (often eccentric) personalities in order to breathe life into the world. Not that you will remember them, though. \\n\\n\r\nArtistically the anime shines, but those looking for something of the same level as previous KyoAni works will likely find themselves disappointed. The animation is fluid, the facial expressions and scenery are fairly detailed, and the color scheme is vibrant\u2014 though little is actually done to enhance the experience. It is an anime that looks and sounds pleasant, but the lavish budget often feels more excessive than beneficial. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Tamako Market is another disposable slice-of-life anime to be consumed and forgotten. The fundamentals are intact, and while there are still signs of potential waiting to be realized, this is an anime that will probably leave you with a bitter feeling of emptiness once it is over. One would think that after KyoAni's success with K-ON, they would understand what is needed to create a quality slice-of-life anime. Apparently not. Perhaps KyoAni should stick to animating existing material from this point on. \\n\\n\r\nTamako Market may not be a bad anime. But it is certainly a lacking one.",

            "content": "(NOTE: This review is written for general anime fans and assumes no familiarity with other series. If you dislike moe, I still think this series is worth watching, for reasons I will discuss below. After episode 5, I decided to bump up the rating to an 8.)\r\nKyoto Animation is very well known for their cute character designs and on the whole, Tamako Market seems like it was a consummate effort on their part. It's not new and it's not original, but it seems like it was created very easily and with great refinement and polish. \r\nSo what is this series about? Not a lot, ifI'm going to be honest. Tamako is the daughter of a mochi (a kind of Japanese rice cake) maker and the episodes seem to revolve around what kind of new mochi she makes for each different occasion. There's a certain educational appeal in this. \\n\\n\r\nTamako Market also focuses on the bonds Tamako has with her friends and family. It captures the feeling of living in a small yet close-knit community. People from all walks of life populate this town and they all interact with each other in simple yet heartwarming ways. This series is a slice of life in the purest sense of the word.\\n\\n\r\nThe most praiseworthy aspect of the anime is the cozy atmosphere it manages to create. It's as if nothing bad will ever happen in this town. It's definitely escapist - but in a different way from most anime. The world of Tamako Market is one where you want to escape to and live in because it's so simple and innocent. If the world was just a little bit more like the one in Tamako Market, it would be a much better place. That's the appeal in these sorts of shows.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, KyoAni seems to have crafted their ultimate cute girl in our heroine Tamako; she is nice, polite and liked by just about everyone in the series. Though she is not a particularly quirky or memorable character (besides being totally dense when it comes to romance - I pity her love interest), her traits are very balanced and she has an air of genuine sweetness that's impossible to dislike. \\n\\n\r\nI do not think Tamako Market is \"moe pandering\". That is an unfair slight against the anime. Yes, the girls are cute, but so is everyone else in the series, even the old men. One particularly charming episode focused on Tamako's FATHER of all people. If anything, this series is targeted for general audiences and has a family friendly feel. It is not an otaku series and it is not trying to be one. I am neither a moe fan nor a moe hater so I would prefer to look at this series through the merits of its STORYTELLING. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem I detect with this series isn't so much in the content so far but in people's expectations of it. I believe the first episode was not a strong indicator of what the series is about. The first episode was high on energy and comedy, mostly through the slight supernatural aspect of the show. A talking bird is the main comic relief mascot of the show and this character featured prominently in the opening episode. \\n\\n\r\nBut Tamako Market isn't really a screwball comedy, even if it does have a quirky sense of humour. It is really a laid-back sort of anime that takes its time to develop the various characters and let the mood sink in. While the premise of the bird character's subplot reappears in the second half of the series, his main role in the series is for a bit of laughs and to support the character development. The few subplots and promises of development lead to nothing in the end, and while it's not necessarily a bad thing to see a story that isn't so focused on a tight storyline, Tamako Market feels particularly light and frothy, all the more so because what plot it manages to build up is deemed irrelevant by the end.\\n\\n\r\nTamako Market sets itself up to be one thing and turns out to be something else. I do consider this to be a flaw in the writing. Even slice of life fans should take note that the dialogue isn't particularly witty and the charm comes across as somewhat calculated. As I said before, it's not moe pandering, but there's a certain \"been there, done that\" aspect to a few of the more emotional scenes - most likely because seasoned anime fans may have already seen them done in previous KyoAni shows, or just in anime in general. That doesn't stop this series from being good at what it does, but there is a distinct feeling that it could have been stronger. Some episodes do drag in their pacing.\\n\\n\r\nStill, it's a nice slice of life show, very clean and perfectly harmless, even though it doesn't do anything new with the genre. Do give it a shot.",

            "content": "Do you like MOE? Are you a fan of Kyoto Animation's other works? Do you enjoy watching cute girls doing cute things? Do you like a talking bird running his narcissistic mouth 24/7 about his superiority and the world around him? Well, if any of those registers a response of \u201cyes\u201d, then this series might be somewhat of an interest for you.\r\nTamako Market is a new original series from Kyoto Animation. The series is directed by Naoko Yamada with the studio known for their other works such as Clannad, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!, Hyouka, and K-On! The series is a standalone title with noother adaptations from any sources of LN/Manga as of known. Now, I admit, this series is a quite something especially in the 'kawaii' department. But beyond that, I'm not sure if Tamako Market lives up to the hype and humor that I originally thought it had.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the series lacks a direct story but takes on a more slice of life style of things in more of the fun way. Take for example, we got that bird named Dera \u201cTori\u201d Mochimazzi (if that even its real name). He claims himself as being \u201cnoble\u201d with a sharp tongue and often talks in an aristocratic pattern. He also seems to be dense of the real world and how it functions. For instance, he takes the girls' actions of colliding into his face as a way of \u201cdeclaring their devotion\u201d towards him. In reality, this is obviously not the case but only a case of allergy. It happens quite often too and Dera being the silly bird that he is takes everything in the way his culture taught him to be. \\n\\n\r\nAs for most of the other characters, the series presents them in the usual cute way, the Kyoto Animation way. There's Tamako Kitashirakawa who stars as the main protagonist of the series. She is a first year student in high school who is enjoying the time of her life. Despite her denseness especially to those in her life, she is very hardworking and strives to help out her family the best way she can. In fact, she is easily able to make friends at school and even at earned the affections (or maybe I should assume here to be accidental fondness) of Dera. Tamako is the main star of the series and hell, even some girls got the hots for her.\\n\\n\r\nAmong some of her friends includes her childhood friend Midori, Kanna (a member of the Baton club), as well as the cool girl Shiori. Oh and let's not forget the guy friend, Mochiz\u014d \u014cji. It is hinted throughout the series that he has a thing for Tamako but who are we kidding here, it's Tamako after all and she gives 'dense' a whole new meaning. In fact, there is even a sort of \u201clove triangle\u201d. Unfortunately, it is quite weak and blend that most viewers will not be able to notice it much. Even so though, the characters all have different personalities as well as what they hope to be in the future. They just seem to be too simple and not enough depth. Given the premise of the show and its genres, it's not too surprising in the case of Tamako Market.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the adults of this show (besides Tamako's cool dad) seems to be more in the background. In this show, the kids are the stars and the adults are the ones on the other horizon. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, this show is rather plot less and lacks any if at all, strong development. In other words, don't go into this series with some sort of strong story because the way it's being handled. However, there are some little things that are amusing to reference to if a viewer pays more careful attention. Most of Tamako's family members' names are related to mochi as well as having meanings. For example, Dela Mochimazzi hates to eat mochi. His last name reflects on the 'mochi is terrible' taste in which he dislikes the taste of mochi. Tamako is also born on New Years Eve which just happens to be the busiest time of the year so her birthday is often forgotten. Well, at least it's better than February 29.\\n\\n\r\nThe series' episodes typically spotlights a certain event in Tamako's daily life as well as spotlighting some of the other characters (including that bird Dela). Even Tamako's little moe sister Anko gets her own episode when she demands to be called \u201cAn!\u201d Shiori had her moments during her own spotlight as she made an impression for Tamako and her friends. Now, they are the best of friends. I won't get to that bird Dera since he tries to steal the show (like he did with the first episode) every week. I do find him quite annoying though as his mouth never seems to stop talking about his ethnics and culture. \\n\\n\r\nAt many stances, I find this series to be cute. We have the Tin-to-Phone talk as a little theme to bring back some childhood nostologia. I mean, ask yourself, when was the last time you talked to someone with a tin can? Nowadays, we got cell phones, androids, and whatever else you watch your anime on. But going back to the old school of using old fashioned tin cans is just something so nostologic. Not only that, it is cute. Among other things, there is a sense of innocence especially with Tamako. Those headbands on her hair and the way she displays her postures in the OP song are all part of this. In fact, Tamako is one of those girls that you can't help but want to be friends with. For Anko's case, her seemingly crush on a fellow classmate turned out to be someone else that most of the cast did not see coming. It's one of those instances where innocence kicks in again and we can't help but smile for Anko; or maybe, I should call her 'An' as she wants to be called.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all cutesy moments and fun, the series does have some dramatic moments and even a somewhat antagonist of the series. This is reflected in the face of Kanna Makino when she has some plans of her own against Midori. Otherwise, some of the drama involving Anko and her classmates are occasionally a pleasant watch. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this show does not escape the typical beach episode. Although not for fan service reasons (I think?), there is a beach episode where the main characters relax and have fun in the sun. It's been done by Kyoto Animation in the past before and here we are again. Otherwise, the series' blend storyline does not make up for its other attributes. Also, that damn bird named Dela tries to steal the show every single episode. He's almost everywhere whether it's on Tamako's head, at the beach, the mochi shop, or at school. He tries to be the star of the series but more often or not, he stays as the comic relief. This is reflected in his personality and the way he behaves himself where the only attention he gets is seemingly what he least expected. He claims to be some kind of aristocratic prince but let's face reality here folks, he is just a flat bird with not even an ounce of hunting skills considering the place he is freeloading in. Talk about being worthless, just like the 'plot'.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, Kyoto Animation does it again. The series has very rich scenery and displays fantastic features of the characters' expressions. The luscious backgrounds along with its strong balance of artistry sets this series as a top tier in the art department. More so though, Tamako Market gives more of a realistic feeling of what is being like in the show. There's the beach, the mochi shop, the neighborhood, and school. It works out right and along with the character designs, we can clearly see that Kyoto Animation is behind this. I mean, just take a close look at Tamako's face. Aren't you CURIOUS about what mystery series' female protagonist that Kyoto Animation worked on previously from where she resembles from?\\n\\n\r\nFor soundtrack, I would say that the ED song is quite catchy. It is playable on repeat and seems like an orchestra that is crafted with a fast rhythm and catching pace. Most of the soundtrack is composed of that lighthearted tone with some added fun choirs in between. The voice actors did an okay job to reflect their tone style although there's a certain character in the series that seems to display some gender confusion. More noticeably though, Tamako's dad displays some musical skills of his own and a few of the background music later on seems to be based off of famous works.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this series gets a '6'. If I was judging it based on cuteness, I would score it something like a 15/10. However, the weak story and seemingly lack of character development makes it less convincing against some other titles from Kyoto Animation's works. That bird by the name of Dera (again, is this even his real name?) is quite annoying and gets repetitive to watch. I do admit though that the series is quite cute and brings a smile to my face whenever I watch it. This time around, I'm not sure if Tamako Market is really that good. Well, it definitely is kawaii.\\n",

            "content": "Before watching Tamako Market, I had to prepare myself. I mean cold showers, a critical state of mind stemmed by delirium, and eating a cup of ramen filled with enough hot sauce to burn my tonsils off. Distraction from the cuteness is key\u2014because the cuteness is paramount. It springs up in all corners, in every moe smile, in every darned bit of music, in every bright color. Beneath a tactful disguise of a thousand hues of pink, a conniving truth festers. If you let your guard down you will never see it.\r\nI\u2019m here to tell you the truth. And the truth is that Tamako Marketis any moe-lover\u2019s dream\u2014on the outside, at least. In case I haven\u2019t mentioned this already, everything is cute. In fact, the cuteness is played up to such a level that all you see, all you notice, is cute. The animation is bright and bubbly and perfectly moe; it fits an anime of this caliber and deserves praise for setting the stage. The voice acting and music will not disappoint. On the outside, Tamako Market is glorious and if one is content with this then good enough for them. But for those of us who begin to question the cuteness, for those of us who find that the cuteness isn\u2019t enough to stop critical analysis, a deeper look is in order. For the sake of this review, I will break through Tamako Market\u2019s fa\u00e7ade. There are few layers beneath. Actually, it\u2019s painfully simple, even more so than some other slice of life anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the bubbly aura that the animation and music emanates, Tamako Market feels uninspired and, weirdly enough, even bland. This isn\u2019t because it\u2019s a slice of life anime. In fact, anime of this genre often have an inexplicably entertaining quality despite the commonplace happenings. Where other similar anime stand strong, fortified by character chemistry and those signature quirky events, Tamako Market can\u2019t seem to establish itself. Everything is there to create another wonderful edition to the world of moe\u2014right? Actually, no. The deeper parts of moe and slice of life, the parts that leave a good anime fan satisfied, are not merely looks but what\u2019s on the inside. It\u2019s just like the question of best girl. She may have to be cute, but there are a lot of cute girls and when it comes down to it, her heart matters more. \\n\\n\r\nFor anime, the heart is something known as plot and characterization.\\n\\n\r\nTamako Market starts off pretty well, introducing us to the cool and friendly place where Tamako lives and Dera, a pompous bird that she just happens to encounter. The story basically revolves around Tamako\u2019s daily life with this bird, her friends, and mochi. The one thing that Tamako Market tells us consistently is that mochi is great, mochi is good, and mochi is life. Otherwise, everything is loosely about friendship, family, and some sort of plot revolving around Dera that comes in when it wants to, only to be remembered when convenient and then sloppily handled at the end. For some, the amount of moe cuteness is enough; getting absorbed in it is fine for them. But the reason why all you see is cuteness and the reason why there\u2019s so much of it is because there isn\u2019t anything else. The best thing that Tamako Market could do was play that up, and it definitely did that. However, those of us looking for something deeper will only be content in watching this anime (though that does not mean they won\u2019t enjoy the ride) instead of absorbing all that it has to offer. Tamako and her friends are the only thing that would make this anime remotely interesting\u2014and that fact doesn\u2019t fare well for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is bland, the jokes are bland (and barely noticed), the crushes are bland (and very badly handled), and the characters (especially the ones with the most screen time) are bland. The latter is the reason why the former is bland. The characters that had promise on episode one bore you by episode twelve because they\u2019re exactly the same. The archetypes that you were introduced to don\u2019t have any deeper facts, quirky characteristics, or new emotions to show you that twelve episodes have passed. Where many slice of life anime keep you interested with facts or entertaining life stories or at least a deeper kind of characterization, Tamako Market doesn\u2019t stretch its legs. All of them are insipidly themselves\u2014Tamako is forever cute and na\u00efve, Kanna is forever unusual, Midori is forever bubbly-ish. In fact, perhaps unsurprisingly, but definitely unfortunately, the most interesting and promising characters are the ones with the least amount of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why Tamako Market fails to inspire praise is because it doesn\u2019t handle itself well. Though another (not implausible) reason is that perhaps it thinks it doesn\u2019t need to, so long as there\u2019s cuteness. Many will agree with that and many anime veterans will not.\\n\\n\r\nLook in each corner, my friends. In one, we have cuteness, the appealing shell. In the other, we have a gray, murky goop, the unappetizing innards. The question of which one will win can only be answered by you, the viewer.",

            "content": "\u201cYou used to be much more... \"muchier\". You've lost your muchness.\u201d - Alice in Wonderland.\r\nNot that I'm a fan of that series, nor that I even know the story (please don't shoot me), but this perfectly describes studio Kyoto in a ball. They've been famous for making various key adaptions such as Clannad and Kanon, and other series being described as far as controversial like Haruhi. But lately, they've been said that the rising hill is sloping downwards now, and Tamako Market contributes to more evidence for that hill, with less and less 'muchness'. That hill consists of weaker attention for the story, and withmore delicious amount of budget and moe to sprinkle the... fillings, not just the topping. That's right, it's the infamous \"style over substance\" type, and Tamako Market went exactly in that route. It'd be really nice to have a good balance of substance, but that doesn't mean we should completely ignore the style either, and it's styles like in Tamako Market that are actually pretty rare.\\n\\n\r\nHence why I used Alice in Wonderland for quoting.\\n\\n\r\n'Tamako Market' means a market full of Tamakos. Just kidding, but please stop laughing at my hilarious well-made joke which was carefully crafted in three whole seconds. It does take place in a market though, and a rather lively one at that. There's several mochi shops rivaling each other, and a high school girl named 'Tamako' is part of the shops. She looooves mochi, and makes 'em for the market who has the happiest atmosphere going around. Also talking bird appears and strange love triangles occur, whilst the mochi shops does the most epic contests against one another, rivaling themselves out with their wild mochi-cooking skills to the point of exhaustion and hardships.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I lied, there's no real cooking rivalry. There's talking birds though.\\n\\n\r\nAs a complete, shocking surprise, it's about nothing, or at least for the majority of the time. However, the way it structures itself gives both an avoid alert and a treat for those for can bear the first few episodes. My initial first response to the first three episodes were that they were \"boring as a wall\", as well as \"stupid as a talking bir- oh wait\". Nothing happens, and it seems a little pretentious with a smiley face to try and keep me engaged with a talking bird hitting on girls. It's only after I finally picked up the series again when it was nearing its end on airing, where the episodes after three actually became a little more than entertaining. It's ironic because, for those of you who follow the three episode rule, you'd be only watching the lowest of the TM episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe structure follows a episodic layout, and it's not surprising as it's a slice of life. They're purely episodic to the core though, as they each contain stories of both main and side characters, dealing with simple problems and affection towards different people and such. This kind of layout already sets you up with the characters in front of you, and since the story doesn't follow a linear line, not much changes or developments grow much, if it has any at all. With that said, it allows you to familiarize yourself with the happy market, and as you get more into the market's pace, you'd find it gets much more enjoyable and natural with different kinds of stories later on.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it can go the opposite effect if you're not fond with the market itself. If you feel the urge to burn those flowers in the shop, that fat talking bird who didn't save the show, those puffy mochi-like cheeks on Tamako and those puffy mochis themselves, then feel free to get up and leave to collect your fire, as you're not going to like the show at all. Don't burn Kanna's hammer though, Kanna's the best in the show. How dare you.\\n\\n\r\nBut I'd be a little surprise for anyone to hate the atmosphere of the anime, particularly the market. I find the atmosphere to be a little more... magical. Which is a little bit of a surprise myself, since I don't tend to find this sort of lovely, bouncy atmosphere in anime often now. The show presents itself in a more musical-play fashion rather than a relaxing one. Things play out like a fantasy musical, if there's anything else to describe it best; the lovely, light soundtrack fleshes the musical style out quite a bit, as some scenes feel as though it's actually a music video. Things flow like flipping through a happy and merrily written book, sometimes ending in a fashion where a message warps up the episode as if it actually ends a good night sleep. It's a lovely atmosphere, and gives a tingly sensation of joy inside... though, it takes a bit of time until it really gets into you (at least after episode 3 for me).\\n\\n\r\nOh, did I ever tell you there was actually a story in the show?\\n\\n\r\nDera, the bird who I just called 'the bird' for a while now, actually comes to the country for a specific reason. That background of the story stays behind the shadows for the majority of the show though, so the reasoning for him lurking in the market isn't because he tried to make a 'moe slice of life about nothing' show more interesting, but for a future reason to be revealed later on. The storyline of the whole situation with Dera isn't so surprising though, and in fact it's fairly simple to get your head around without the need of developments or plot twists. It's ever so simple writing, with a vague climax that doesn't really make up for the entire series, so if you're expecting your wow meter to be of the chart, don't be.\\n\\n\r\nThat and the fact the actual story is literally behind the shadows doesn't keep any sort of substance following, since it's pretty much hidden in the entire series. There's not even a sense of mystery either; the market's being too busy smiling so much that a fat bird that can talk is something that should be subjected upon, since even scientists can't find birds in the world who can freaking talk, let alone a noble perverted one. The point though is that it's a super simple story which doesn't get put on subject until the few last episodes of the show, and so the rest of the episodes is just about character stories in the market, as said earlier. There's no linear story to follow; only those in the market.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the lovely dovely production values for now, and take a break of the main cake of the show. What do you expect from Kyoto Animation then? In comparison to ChuChu and Hyouka, the budget doesn't go as astounding as those two. It's more comparable to the likes of K-On!! though, as they are done by the same sub-team as each other. The animation is very fluent with its movement, making them extremely fun to watch and building up a good amount of gif files in your folders. The main girls are in the baton club too; what's more fun than looking at cute girls throwing and spinning batons around in the hall? Also, there's quite a blob of moe in the anime, though it's not focused upon as much as people state it is. If you are allergic to moe and get itchy spots down there, you can stay away from this, but I honestly don't see how or why it's a big problem for the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is ever so musically lovely. I wish the OST is already out, but it seems like it only goes as far as the character songs for download. Anyway, the soundtrack provides the magical atmosphere even further, and fits the entire show almost perfectly, as said earlier. The opening contributes to the magic musical style too, though not so much of the ED as that's more of a J-Pop serious song. It's not much of a problem, since it's musically very well-done, and it's a must-have to get the full version of. Sound effects and directing is consistently good, and the OST is used wonderfully, fitting from a cute AMV to a mini musical narration play thingymajigy, as described earlier. Voice acting is great too, and Dera's voice gives of the royalty feel of his being quite well. Well... mostly royalty.\\n\\n\r\nBut umm... about Dera....\\n\\n\r\nSome say he's the life saver of the anime, whilst others state he's a big, fat thing wasting precious screen time for the anime. In theory, he's only set in the market because of plot (oh how convenient!), right? But, as said three main paragraphs ago, the actual story is bored behind the shadows, so Dera's not actually needed 9 tenths of the time. His personality is of a king's noble servant, yet he's not aware that all his 'charm' are not actually capturing any of the girls' hearts at all. Even mochi proves him as a clown, turning him bloated and heavy. He's in the show listed as a main character, but it's in fact that he only proves to be a comedic clown character who can in fact be super annoying to some and praise-worthy to others.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not he saves the entire show is an entirely different question. Without him, Tamako Market would be a normal slice of life about mochis, lesbians and magical happy atmosphere floating around. It can only prove Dera as a little bit of a plot device to bring the \"plot\" to the market, but even without him the effects of being bored as a brick in the first few episodes would be the same. His existence is very polarizing in opinions because of his strange noble personality, with a sense of weird affection birds shouldn't even have towards girls, and sometimes he just kills moments by narrating with a somewhat cheesy voice. That said, if you really hate to see him, he's hardly the center of attention in the majority of the time, so be glad or be sad; either way, this talking bird isn't going to leave his mochi behind you'd still have to deal with him in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAside the case of the talking bird though, there's a whole cast of other characters too. You got the group of girls being Tamako's friends (Tamako being the main character, if you haven't noticed), who are blond Midori, glasses Shiori and the best character in the entire show, Kanna. Her ruler and hammer wins me over, and so she proves best award for Tamako Market person. The market has a ton of people living there; a flowerist whose gender is unknown, other mochi makers and shop keepers plus the families, the friendly elderly people, dancing old man, newly bird couple, little kids and so on. It's quite a colourful bunch, and the entire cast brings the happy and lively atmosphere in the area, so lively that it's a little unnatural to be in, but nevertheless fun. Several of the characters get a decent amount of screen time, but not much can be said about the developments. They're pretty interesting and likable in their own right, especially having the center of attention in some of the episodes (though Kanna doesn't weep weep...). The cast is a fun bunch, in conclusion, but even with some background and attention, development doesn't really grow upon nearly all of them (except Dera, funny enough).\\n\\n\r\nTamako Market can be regarded as another moe creation from Kyoto, and with even more style and less substance than before. Popularity sure got them \"muchier\", but now their muchness has shrunk over the years to the point where great things wave bye-bye to their opportunities of potential (talking about that one Key VN which got rejected because Kyoto was 'too busy'... forever cry weep weep...). That all said, Tamako Market wasn't as bad of a ride than I thought it'd be, but stating that the story is extremely unique and well-written is worth face-palming.\\n\\n\r\nI wonder what Kyoto's going to do in the future then. And should I look forward to it?",

Before you watch Tamako Market, you should read this review.\r\nIt's obviously that specific genres of anime are often intensely focused on a certain genders and age groups, including a female protagonist with her friends. In fact, KyoAni giving many adorable scene to made the fans adore their cuteness. There's one alternative different anime, had same producers like K-ON!. ( Kyo Ani. Why.)  This story is mostly apparent when one considers the slice of life and comedy category.\r\nThis all seem to have several things in common - cute characters, adorable face, a funny face,\"cute\" costume changes then.. a fat bird APPEARS! I can say this anime looks funny. I'd rather to give my grateful for this anime because many people always looking at their art and characters, a good storyline. If you really likes Dandere, A bit tsundere, cheerful female protoganist, and you have it. I've read your mind. It was like you want to say; \"I wanna to take the girls in my home. then HNNNNNNNNNGG.\"\\n\\n\r\nBack to main topic, there is a \"can't resist the moeness\" girl named Tamako Kitashirakawa, A first-year in high school student whose family runs a mochi shop in their town's shopping district, She helps her family run the shop and invent new various of mochi. the shopkeepers loves them. ( Everyone loves Tamako. *Thumbs up*) along with her two best friend. Midori and Kanna. Fortunately, there's one guy who fall in love with Tamako. You have no regret to watch this. So it's a good thing theanime is as entertaining as it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest is yours. I ended my review. Thank you.",

            "content": "Tamako Market may be derived from the same recipe as KyoAni's other SOL anime, but its taste is a little off.\r\nAs always, my reviews are spoiler free.\r\nKyoto Animation, the makers of the wildly successful Haruhi and K-On! series, realized something a few months after K-On! finished airing.  Cute girls doing cute things (afterwards CGDCT; call it \"moe\" if you want to, that's another argument entirely) really sells.  The following seasons, and to the day that this review is being written, there have been dozens of series that tried to ride the CGDCT wave all the way to the bank.  Most have triedto stand out from the crowd by adding a unique flavor, but in the end it's obvious that they are just trying to scrape up a little more of K-On!'s success.  Most have faded into obscurity, but one that is just trying to keep its head above water is Tamako Market.\\n\\n\r\nChief among the culprits of these \"copies\" are KyoAni themselves; aside from K-On!! (more ! means more seasons), they released a continuous string of SOL/CGDCT (or CBoysDCT in Free!'s case) with Kyoukai no Kanata being the only break in sight.  Among these was Tamako Market, the subject of review today.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nTo begin, here is the short and simple premise:  Tamako is a high school girl whose family runs a mochi shop.  One day she meets a talking bird from a faraway island who is in search of a bride for his prince.  \\n\\n\r\nLet's put the premise aside for a moment though.\\n\\n\r\nSOL anime are very difficult to approach in the story category.  Rather than a near-objectively good story (such as Steins;Gate) or near-objectively poor story (such as Skelter Heaven), a SOL story has a \"feel\" to it.  A personal favorite of mine is the Aria series, giving an overarching sense of serenity as the characters go about their lives in a beautiful setting.  Even when restricted to high school life, as so many SOLs are, one can find much better \"feelings,\" such as Azumanga Daioh or Hyouka.  Each has their own unique charm or interesting characters that draw the viewer in.  The problem with Tamako Market is that it doesn't have charm or interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe charm that it tried to present was a combination of the talking bird, Dera, and some manor of suppressed romantic subplot around Tamako.  Neither one is anywhere close to interesting enough to save the biggest problem in the series: the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni is not one to slack on the animation budget.  All of their recent works are above average in the animation and art department, especially Hyouka.  However, compared with each recently animated series, Tamako Market gives off a \"good enough\" feeling.  Those backgrounds are \"good enough.\"  Those side character designs were \"good enough.\"  That fluidity was \"good enough.\"  It's hard to fool a KyoAni fan when they see what the studio is capable of with releases such as Disappearance and Hyouka.  Even the previous season's Chuunibyou was leagues ahead.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series is below average effort from a far above average studio, but it looks as good or better than most comparable series.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe backing tracks were good and upbeat. The OP was catchy and fun.  However, the real thing I want to mention here are the voice actors and actresses.  This series used many brand new seiyuu, and they did a great job.  They need to get more roles.  \\n\\n\r\nThis was well above the standard of most similar series, but still not up to the bar of K-On! or Hyouka.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where things really went wrong.  Let's do a roll call...\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast:\\n\\n\r\n-Tamako, the world's densest girl who is always smiling and optimistic to a near-creepy degree.  She loves nothing in the world more than mochi, which is probably why she can never notice the obvious advances of her friends Mochizou and Midori.  She has no other features at all.\\n\r\n-Kanna, who is as poker-faced as Tamako is smiley.  She does not appear to have emotions or react to many stimuli.  She is just a token friend.\\n\r\n-Midori, the closet lesbian.  She shows obvious romantic interest throughout the series that Tamako never notices.  Other than being token friend #2, she tries to \"protect\" Tamako from the romantic advances of others, as if she needs more protection than her denseness.\\n\r\n-Dera, the stuck up bird comic relief.  He will be very polarizing, with some viewers loving his aloof humor and others hoping Dera hunting season will soon open in Japan.  He also has a video-phone feature.\\n\r\n-Choi, the bride hunting brown girl.  She arrives in Japan from a small island kingdom, coming after Dera.  She is often harsh for no reason, especially to Dera, as she is his handler.  She can use him in some sort of divination ritual.  She believes Tamako may the bride for her island's prince.\\n\r\n-Mochizou, who likes Tamako too.  He is from the mochi shop right across the street (capitalism ho!).  He constantly tries to confess to Tamako, but it is like trying to explain your love to a rock.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast consists of many characters who are mainly family members or store owners.  They all serve their sole purpose to populate the world or fill a space in the story.\\n\\n\r\nIf you think I am summarizing character personalities, I'm not.  I have written full biographies for each of them.  They are incredibly boring.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy Tamako Market because of the boring setting and the \"feeling\" I talked about earlier.  I've seen hundreds of similar shows, and Tamako Market falls right into the \"average\" category.  The only reason it hasn't been forgotten like other K-On! chasers like A-Channel is that it was made by the same studio.\\n\\n\r\nOther Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni is one of my favorite studios, but I think they really dropped the ball on this one.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many, many better CGDCT/SOL shows that you could watch.  Do yourself a favor and give this one a miss.  Take a look at K-ON!, Aria, Hyouka, Chuunibyou, Tamayura, Haruhi, Yuru Yuri, Azumanga Daioh or any other of the dozens of better series of this nature.",

            "content": "This time KyoAni surprised me with stuff and things. THINGS. \r\nThere has been quite a lot of criticism about how Tamako Market is nothing but a slice of life moe silliness. I, however, spotted quite a few things which I think should come to the knowledge of others in case not everyone notices THINGS.\r\nTamako Market has a strong position taking message about moe and cuteness in generally. It's rather simple, actually. Tamako Market is an anime about nothing. Tamako Market is cute. And thus nothing =is= cute. Self-irony much? I think this is pretty much a big deal considering that majority (read;all) KyoAni shows areconsidered cute. Also moe = mochi over everything. Deep and lots of THINGS.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that has been bugging so many is this series is the originality. Talking pimp bird who is secretly a video projector? Nigga whose ass looks like a peach? Has been done before? I don't thinks so. Eva didn't do it. Logh tried but failed. In my eyes it is very original, and peach-like. \\n\\n\r\nThere sureasfuckinghell was no inbetween. The animation in this series was reversally made. Pretty sure majority has seen some crazy-ass amount of .gif's about cute girls doing cute THINGS and whatnot. Tamako Market often looks like a collection of those. The characters are jumping and teleporting all over the screen without any sense, making the series look like a .gif slide show. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, themes and bgm are all quite fitting to the series. Though, I still don't know if that one blond who likes flowers is really female because she(?) really sounds like a dude. Trapsome pick there I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThis series made me feel kinda happy and smile and STUFF. I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants to see something good and amazing because this is neither, but I think anyone who wants to see something light without overwhelming amount of moe and melodrama could enjoy this STUFF.",

            "content": "I've had a close eye turned toward Kyoto Animation since Haruhi and Lucky Star, Nichijou and K-On! are all anime I would count among my favorites. Needless to say I wasn't going to be able to stay away from a Kyoto Animation produced show from many of the people who brought us the last of those forever. K-On! was a fun, lovable, funny, sweet anime with a set of characters who could be described in equal terms. I expected similar things from Tamako Market and to an extent that is what I received, though the packaging was quite a bit different that I was expecting.\r\nMostof the shows I name dropped above had a certain formula. They focus on four-five high school students, mostly girls, trading elliptical comic dialogs, doing cute things and engaging in some manner of mischief or silliness. It's a working formula; one that allows a show to easily entertain while keeping the focus tight so the characters can be developed. Tamako market has a set of four cute and somewhat quirky high school girls, but they're not actually where the focus is at all. The focus quite fittingly enough is on one girl, Tamako, and the market where she lives and works. Oh, and some weird talking bird too.\\n\\n\r\nThis is kind of an odd approach. It takes away from the humor potential some. It gives the show a lot of work to do, more than it can possibly hope to do or even try to do with twelve episodes. It's unusual, especially if the goal was to repeat the success of K-On!. I can't actually see this show doing that as a result. However, for what it is, Tamako Market just oozes a lot of charm. It's an easy series to like.\\n\\n\r\nPart of that is that KyoAni have made another great looking anime. It doesn't have as much great visual flourish as they brought to Nichijou, mind you, but this show doesn't really need all that. It's a fairly understated series, and the animators do a good job of setting just the right tone. Character designs are distinctive and attractive yet generally believable. On the sound end, most of the actors do a pretty good job and music is well utilized at points. The OP and ED are both rather charming and cute, though a little less memorable than KyoAni's best themes.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the plot to Tamako Market is tied to its characters, and they are an interesting cast. The main character, Tamako herself, is an odd main character. She's rather ordinary. Somewhat dense and excitable, but put her next to someone like Yui from K-On and she's downright understated. She's a hardworking, cheerful, bright-eyed girl and that's really all there is to her. I could see this same character being a well-liked minor supporting character in practically any other anime. I think that's likely the point though; she's universal, she's believable and she's easy to like, both by the viewer and the characters. She doesn't develop noticeably as a character all too much through the show, but it's clear she touches the other characters in certain ways.\\n\\n\r\nTamako has two romantic interests, not that she seems very aware of either of their advances. One is Mochizou, the son of the shop which is rival to her family's shop. The other is Midori, Tamako's best friend from childhood who is beginning to realize her feelings for Tamako are deeper than normal friendship. It's an interesting setup, but nothing ever really come of it. Mochizou isn't developed much beyond just being a likable and good natured everyman. Midori's feelings are conveyed effectively and believably without dwelling on them excessively, but are never really confronted directly. More could have been done with these two, but as it is any potential dramatic tension there is ignored.\\n\\n\r\nRounding out the school girl set with Tamako and Midori are Kanna and Shiori. Kanna is the one of the bunch who probably could actually fit in a more K-On! type show; she's hilarious and a bit of an oddball and is delightful whenever she's around. Shiori is the shy one who at first seems cold; while cute and having a good design, she gets a bit lost in the shuffle after her episode and ends up being a character without much place in the story. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Tamako's family and the shopping district. The family is pretty well done. Tamako's younger sister is a very believable child character with her own little arc. Tamako's father also ends up being a very well developed and likable character, who seems to grow through the story more than a lot of characters. The other shop keepers in the market don't get much time individually to be developed, but the designs are good and the warm, familiar way they're constantly being portrayed makes them quite likable as well. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the bird. I'm not entirely sure what to make of Dera. He's an odd character, and one that steals the focus a lot. He's perhaps supposed to be the source of most of the comedy in the series, and in that capacity he does have his moments, particularly when he and Kanna interact. He is a character who it's easy to get too much of though, and at times it does seem like the show would be better if he was shoved away somewhere for a while. Of course he's also the instigator of the overarching \"plot\" of Tamako Market for what it is, but not much comes of that save another fairly fun and cute character, Choi, being brought to the show for the second half.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is very likable on a whole and there are spots of good character development. The show just seems unable to get to everything it should, and for that it suffers some. However, while KyoAni doesn't have another masterpiece on their hands, they do have what I'd still call a very good anime. It has a few flaws and could have just generally used more episodes to do more with its setup and characters, but Tamako Market remains a quite enjoyable offering all the same.",

            "content": "Tamako Market, your seemingly storyless moe anime variety. I don't exactly remember what made me start this, but I loved it near instantly. I'm actually really disappointed that this wonderful anime is over, and I very much would love a second season. Yes, TM's cute. Does it have no story? Is it pointless? To answer those questions it'd be a heck no! It has it's both sad and heartwarming scenes, and more.\r\nTM's story is simple; a girl, Tamako, works at a mochi shop with her father, sister, and grandfather. Across the street is a rival mochi shop and home of a boy, Mochizou, who's interestedin the oblivious Tamako. The story is of Tamako's life in both the shop, a bit of her school life, along with her two good friends. In the midst of all this, a strange talking bird appears to Tamako, and tells her he is here to find a bride for his prince. There's a decent amount of humor included. Another fact is that my younger cousins who are definitely NOT into moe, who play FPS and strategy games all the time, ENJOY this anime. TM is a simple, but heartwarming and sweet one story. If you're like me, it's able to give you feels. Happy emotions, bittersweet emotions, sad ones... this anime is able to pack many feelings into one.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this show is of course by KyoAni, so it should seem familiar. The animation is fluid, the colors are bright, warm, and cold; it's high quality. However, anatomy-wise, it might be a little bit less accurate than K-ON!, especially with all of the characters' legs, and this applies to 99% of everyone. The female characters' hands are really small and inconsistent, and at times are either too small, other times, they're actually correctly drawn. It's not too big of an issue, though. Expressions are well-done, and lively. All in all, the animation is pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending for Tamako Market are amazing. The colorful, upbeat op is a lively tune. The song matched the op sequence very well. The ending, stunning, and very catchy to boot. I find it stuck in my head, often... the seiyu for Tamako sings both of these, and she is a pretty good vocalist! The voice acting for TM is great- the cast's voices match very well. Even the bgm's great- matching, quirky, catchy songs. Love the music for TM.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters of this show, I find unique and lovable. Tamako is just darling and it's hard to not love her. Her friends are also unique, and have nice quirks to them. I adore both Tamako and Kanna, her brown-haired, measurement enthusiast friend. The shopping district residents are colorful, and they're all depicted very, very warmly, and are all individuals of their own right. We can't forget Dera, the characteristic bird who comes to visit. Also a lovable \"character\" indeed.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoy Tamako Market, even when I thought I wouldn't. It's one of the most promising series for this season for me, so you can imagine how much I like it. Every time a new episode arrives, I get really excited and smiles appear on my face no matter how down I feel. A great anime to go to if you're not feeling very happy, or you're down in the dumps.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, you should watch this anime if you don't mind lightheartedness and slice of life. This anime is the one I very eagerly wait to see every week this entire season. It's a warm and sweet story, so please enjoy!",

It has a total of 12 episodes and has already been licensed by Sentai Filmworks.\r\nGenre: Comedy, Slice of Life, School Life, Cooking\r\nPlot: 7/10\r\nThe story revolves around Tamako Kitashirakawa, a normal high school girl that\u2019s working in her family\u2019s mochi shop. She enjoys her everyday school life with her friends, the work in the mochi shop and in general her life as a member of the town\u2019s shopping district.\r\nOne day an unexpected guest arrives, Dera Mochimazzwi, a talking bird, a royal one on top of that, arrivesfrom a faraway place to announce his plan of searching for the perfect bride for his prince. Finding a liking to the Kitashirakawa family and most of all to their mochi, Dera ends up staying a little longer, becoming a freeloader in their home.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSounds a little weird huh? It\u2019s actually a very odd mix of a totally normal group of friends, enjoying their everyday school life and a totally unusual talking bird on a royal mission. But as crazy as this combination may sound, it is first of all, very enjoyable and interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s be honest, you don\u2019t have to think about much watching this anime, I would even say you can just shut off your brain and watch this without thinking about anything at all. And since this is like 80% Tamako\u2019s normal school life and 20% bossy bird talking and eating mochi, this is like the perfect show to watch in between those ones that you need to actually pay close attention to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nTamako Kitashirakawa:  She is the protagonist of the Anime and the oldest daughter of the Kitashirakawa family. Since her mother passed away when she was still little, she is now living with her younger sister, her father and her grandfather, working in their family\u2019s mochi shop. While Tamako is hardworking, always helping out in the shop and in general the portrayal of the perfect daughter, she can at times be a complete airhead that is totally oblivious to her surroundings.\\n\\n\r\nDera Mochimazzwi: As an attendant, but primarily a member of a royal family of a faraway tropical island, Dera is ordered to find his prince\u2019s bride. Being a bird he\u2019s the perfect choice for this task, but as soon as Dera gets to know Tamako and of course her delicious mochi, he quickly gains some weight and is hence unable to fly for too long. As the noble bird that Dera claims to be, he tends to act a little bossy and commanding around everyone even though he is never treated with the respect he would want to be treated with.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many more important characters, each and everyone with a very unique personality, I would even say that the presentation of the characters is one of the strong points of this anime. We got a proper introduction of almost every (important) character, each one of them got their own background story and enough screen time to make their character look appealing to the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\r\nWhen first seeing a clip of this anime online, I was mistaking it for K-On and you have to agree, those two shows look very much alike, probably because they are both produced by Kyoto Animation.\\n\r\nIn my opinion the animation, just like in K-On, was very well done, I kind of like the cute artwork, those big eyes, round faces and adorable expressions. \\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the word they used to describe K-On? I think it was \u201cmoe\u201d, which basically means something like \u201cthe ideal of youthful and innocent femininity\u201d and that\u2019s exactly how Tamako Market presents Tamako and her friends.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Music: 7/10\\n\r\nWhile I think the opening theme \u201cAya Suzak - Dramatic Market Ride\u201d was not that catchy but good nonetheless, the ending theme \u201cAya Suzak - Neguse\u201d left a much bigger impression on me. It doesn\u2019t happen often that I really listen to the ending of an anime, but this one is really catchy. For the background music, I can\u2019t even tell whether this show had any kind of background music at all, other than the songs they played in the little record store. I guess this means the background music wasn\u2019t that impressive but on the other hand I can\u2019t recall any moment in which I was bothered by the music as well.\\n\\n\r\nTotal enjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nTamako Market is far from being a masterpiece, but then again I don\u2019t think it aimed to be one to begin with. It\u2019s a light comedy with an overdose of cuteness put into each and every episode. In addition to that it\u2019s also very simple and all in all a nice anime to watch especially when you are a fan of cute girls doing cute stuff.",

            "content": "Tamako Market could best be described as like watching a 5 hour long advert for mochi. The shallow story never really allowed me to feel a connection with any of the characters, but was sure to tell us that mochi is, in fact, quite delicious, and something about the power of friendship and family. Special attention to Japanese culture is also given, through the introduction of foreigners who, despite having perfect (and never explained) Japanese language ability, are completely oblivious to aspects of life in Japan. \r\nCharacter design is by Yukiko Horiguchi of Lucky Star and K-On! fame -- in fact, the characters look almostidentical to those from K-On!, with the main character Tamako appearing deceptively like K-On's Mio with twin tails. And indeed, this is yet another installment of cute girls doing cute things. However, unlike K-On!, Tamako Market lacks any of the charm of similar shows, and is only memorable for a handful of things: an obnoxious talking bird who apparently is trying to be the second coming of Casanova, a beautiful florist voiced by Daisuke Ono, and -- oh yes, not least of all -- mochi and more mochi. It's mildly amusing, but don't expect too much. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the character voices are bland, with a few exceptions, and the opening theme is utterly forgettable or even slightly annoying. In contrast to the dull sound, however, the artwork is beautiful -- one of the few redeeming aspects of this series. \\n\\n\r\nI can't say I hated Tamako Market. It's pretty, occasionally funny, and depicts idealised life in a small shopping district with a bit of surrealism thrown in. But it felt like a lot of time to spend watching something that never managed to rise above mediocre.",

I\u2019m in the middle of episode 12, but I can\u2019t bring myself to finish it. I don\u2019t care anymore. I don\u2019t care about you, Tamako, or your friends or whatever mundane crap you\u2019re doing. And that\u2019s the problem, isn\u2019t it? There\u2019s nothing to care about.\r\nTamako Market is about a cute girl (Tamako) that works in a mochi shop. She has cute friends, she has a cute sister, and she lives in a quaint neighborhood market. She goes to school, she talks with a guythat has a crush on her, and she has a talking bird.\\n\\n\r\n By the way, the talking bird has more screen time than any of those little dipshits in the show. He\u2019s flamboyant and has some passion. His dialogue is decently interesting. He\u2019s probably the best character because everybody else is bland moeblob. \\n\\n\r\nSlice-of-life is not a bad genre. No genre is unless you\u2019re doing \u201cMagical Girl Sports Military Harem Fighting Furry Adventures.\u201d I\u2019m gonna throw out this original, patented thought and say King of the Hill is one of the best animate slice-of-lives out there. I\u2019ll even put in those Nickelodeon cartoons like Hey Arnold!.\\n\\n\r\nWhy? Because every episode gives you something to care about. It has plot and character development. The most basic definition of SOL is anything episodic without a main story, but it still needs to follow the rules of good writing. Every season of King of the Hill is Hank selling propane (and propane accessories), Peggy being a bitch, and Bobby being a little shit. Hey Arnold! is Arnold solving everybody\u2019s problems whether they want him to or not. In Tamako Market, there are no conflicts for me to care about. Nothing. That's why Tamako Market is so boring, and took me 6 months to get through.\\n\\n\r\nSo does this garbage have any redeeming value? Well, it looks fantastic as do all KyoAni shows. The animation is colorful and bubbly. The characters are cute. It always puts me in the mood for mochi. \\n\\n\r\nBut what went wrong? It\u2019s the sheer lack of anything to care about. The characters are actually decent. It\u2019s just that without any conflict there\u2019s nothing about them to root for. The closest thing that resembled a conflict was one of Tamako\u2019s friends couldn\u2019t come up with a dance routine for school and she spent the episode hiding it. If this plot sounds familiar then a Saturday morning cartoon has probably done it and better.\\n\\n\r\n Cute girls, but nothing to care about. Another painfully boring slice-of-life.",

            "content": "When I heard about Kyoto Animation's latest series Tamako Market, my expectations were probably unusually high. I had just come off of watching, and loving both Hyouka and Clannad, and was expecting another spectacular series in a similar vein to those two. Of course, that's not at all what I got. \r\nBeing directed by Naoko Yamada, written by Reiko Yoshida, and character designs provided by Yukiko Horiguchi (all of who worked in the same positions on K-ON!) this series has quite a lot of similarity with said series. However, I was unaware of this fact before I started the show, so maybe my expectations wereslightly unreasonable. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there's a lot to talk about in Tamako Market, so let's get on to the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10): Tamako Market doesn't really have much of a story. The series is almost a textbook example of a slice-of-life series. The show follows the main character Tamako who is a carefree, bouncy energetic girl who absolutely loves mochi. She has a friend named Mochizuo who, like Tamako, is the child of a mochi making family. She also has a few friends from school who pop into the story, but I'll explain about them in the characters section. In essence, one day a talking bird name Dela Mochimazzi wreaks havoc when he jumps into the shopping market, saying he's looking for a bride for his prince, and the story follows their daily, mostly episodic lives.\\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn't really have much weight, but the individual episodes range from enjoyable to boring. I was really put off by the first episode when the bird came off as more annoying than funny, but I'd say the writers of the show got better at using him as the show went on. The series bills itself as a comedy, and in that regard, its a hit and miss. While the slice of life stories were somewhat enjoyable, I would have preferred an actual story. Which was why I was surprised when in the second half of the show, it did try to give us an actual story. When the series decided to go down this route, I was really excited, hoping for a very interesting finale.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, I got a very lackluster ending with a forced, and very anti-climatic resolution. Sad as it is, the ending almost ruined the show for me, as this was the part of the series I was looking forward to the most. None of the character drama was really resolved, and I felt the ending just could have been done SO much better. Overall though, I found the story fun to watch, and I was really waiting during the second half to see how the ending would play out.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10): Easily the best part of the series. While the character designs are simple enough, and are all too familiar to K-ON!, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The animation is of very high quality, and really helps to sweep the viewer away into this simple, yet relaxing world the vast amount of colorful characters in the shopping district live in. The backgrounds are simple, yet really help to bring out the best in the character design and animation brought to the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10): The music definitely isn't spectacular, but it does fit the show. The opening theme is really catchy, while the ending theme is very forgettable. The BGM fits very well in the series, and the shining moments for the music is truly when they played with the comedic timing. I know, a rather skimpy entry, but that's all there really is to say about the music. Fitting, yet mostly forgettable. The voice acting is really well done though, and I found especially fitting of the characters, especially the bird's voice (which always cracked me up.)  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): If there is one thing Tamako Market is not, its being a character driven series. Most of the characters are given broad character types, and don't show much depth. I was annoyed by this through most of the series, but eventually came to realize that the characters are still very fun in their own right. In addition, they did start to flirt with character depth in the second half of the series, with Tamako having a partial emotional breakdown, Dela actually showing himself as more than just a bossy bird, and even the dad shows some depth. Regardless, none of this is fleshed out, and as someone who absolutely loved the characters in Hyouka and Clannad, this disappointed me.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that doesn't mean the characters aren't a lot of fun. Tamako is bouncy, a bit of an airhead, yet as with the other girls in this show, really cute, and reminds me of Chitanda from Hyouka in a good way. Her friend Midori was an interesting concept, and I was really hoping they'd give some resolution to her possible feelings for Tamako. Dela started out as EXTREMELY annoying, but actually became a really funny character as the show went on. Tamako's friend Kanna gets some laughs to, even if she doesn't have much character, and so does Tamako and Mochizuo's fathers, who are both really funny characters as soon as they first appear. Mochizuo himself is a rather large stereotype with zero depth, but still has his own charm as being the childhood potential love interest.\\n\\n\r\nOne character is a surprise character who doesn't appear until the second half of the show, so I won't spoil it for you, but this character easily became one of my favorites. Overall, I thought this diverse cast of characters may lack much depth, but were still a lot of fun to watch on screen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10): Because of the mass disappointment of the ending, I had to drop this down to a 7. Regardless, I did find a lot to enjoy in the series. The atmosphere is so calm and peaceful, you fall in love with it almost immediately. The characters are a little wacky, but that's partially where they get their charm from. Everything in this series is peaceful, and rather mundane, even when considering the second half of the series, but that doesn't mean I didn't like it. I just would have preferred more deep characters, and a story with more weight.\\n\\n\r\nWhile my favorite part of the series was definitely just staring at the gorgeous artwork, it wasn't just the art itself that ended up giving the series a boost, but it really did bring the characters and the setting to life. All of the designs are simplistic, yet gorgeous, and its almost exactly how you'd envision such a setting in your imagination. However, with all its bells and whistles, the series' ending was still disappointing, and I definitely would have liked more character development and an actual story.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy, meanwhile, like I said earlier, is hit and miss. Some of the jokes were really funny, while others were irritating and a bit annoying. However, I did feel the comedy helped bring out the characters, and the jokes were funny enough to give the series a breath of fresh air in order to get me through some really boring episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7.5/10): If you could give .5s on this website, that's definitely what I'd give this series. While the ending was very disappointing, the characters didn't have much depth, and the art was a bit simplistic, the characters were still hilarious, and very fun to watch, the artwork and animation was gorgeous, and the comedy aspect of the series was really funny when it hit a stride.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I definitely wouldn't recommend this series to those who only enjoy a series if it has a deep story, riveting characters and or lots of action, for those who are willing to get swept away in this calm, peaceful, sometimes hilarious story with its simple setting, and quirky, funny characters, this series is probably worth a watch, even if its just to relax from watching said heavy action,plot, character development series.\\n",

Yes it got a lot of cute characters and ridiculous day to day situations and it's mainly a topnotch comedy with lot's of funny moments (That damn fat bird was just too much)\r\nOn the other hand it got subtle hints whither it's words, glances or simple gestures that actually make you think about more than just that. (It doesn't smack you in the face with it) at least that's what it did to me\r\nStill thecomedy it self was really great and really enjoyable and makes the show well worth the time.\\n\r\nThe movie got less of the ridiculousness and focuses more on the romance aspect (well it's called \"Love Story\" duh)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\r\nThe show offers a lovable and down to earth collection of characters (except for the that fat arrogant bird :D). It was a blast to watch how characters interacted with each other\\n\r\nIt was somehow low on character development but it did offer some (this is also something you will get through subtle hints and gestures)\\n\r\nThe movie will offer a little bit more character development but only to what serves the ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (10/10):\\n\r\nThis is a Kyoto Animation anime so you will be having a lot of colorful and beautiful environments and top notch designs and the characters will look beautiful and cute (The eyes are as sparkle as ever)\\n\r\nAnimations look sharp and detailed and there is a lot of attention to simple movements and gestures\\n\\n\r\nMusic & VA (8/10):\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were what you would expect of this kind of show but the soundtrack featured some special tracks in some points of the show that helped set the general mode.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was quite good as well\\n\\n\r\nEffectiveness (8/10):\\n\r\nIt was a really enjoyable show and even though the plot was somehow episodic it was still satisfying and it offered some great comedy that (as i said) just by it self will make the show worth the watch supported by it's nice collection of characters. People might think that i am overestimating the show but it really was a beautiful anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.4/10)",

            "content": "Everyone knows what to expect from Tamako Market even before it aired. Kyoto Animation's on a roll and churning out the cute-girls-doing-cute-things anime ever since K-ON became a smashing success and that their mo\u00e9blobs literally oozes money. Plus, Tamako Market is an original; meaning they had free reign to stuff mo\u00e9 into the show in any way and every way possible.\r\nSo is it a cheap strategy that banks on a recycled stereotype? Shockingly, not at all. The gargantuan budget allowed superb production quality and a fair amount of creativity as well; the mo\u00e9blob of the season, Tamako, proved that there still could be something newfor this archetype. She's bubbly, but not clumsy. She's energetic, but not loud. She's mellow, but not air-headed. She's friendly, but not insensitive. She could have carried the whole show by herself.\\n\\n\r\nNot that she has to. There's also the ridiculous obese talking bird of royal heritage, which is half of what made the show so funny. There's also the friendliness and homeliness of the shopping arcade, Tamako's quirky friends, the childhood friend that has a crush on her, and the tsundere dad. I ended most episodes knowing that nothing important has actually happened, but those factors made sure I never had a boring time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while endings has always been a weakness of these plot-less titles, Tamako Market has managed to end things on a surprisingly enjoyable high note. If I had to complain about something, it would be that their pinafore-styled uniform made then look like elementary students. Maybe that's actually the intention?\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, KyoAni delivered. Damn it, man. They're setting the bar too high for me to enjoy the other stuff. Giving something like this a full score makes me look stupid, man, but even if I try, I can't see it deserves any lower.",

            "content": "The winter 2013 anime season brought to us many good anime series, a great starter for the year and as always KyoAni has delivered something that I really enjoyed. Nothing special, just something that helps delivers one\u2019s moods to spring. (I will try not to spoil too much)\r\nTamako market is a simple slice-of-life story about a Tamako Kitashirakawa, a high school girl in a small town, who\u2019s the daughter of a mocchi (Japanese rice cake) maker in a shopping district. The show allows us to have a view of her and people in the community, their personality and lifestyle, with a small twist...  theTalking Bird, Dera Mocchimazui; who enters the community accidentally while searching for a bride for his prince, in a tropical kingdom far away.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole series seems to represent the ideal small town life in Japan, with an extremely close knit community that could be considered one big family and the simple happiness of their seemingly bland, mundane life.  From New Years to summer festivals, it shows us to how they handle their lives and new situations and problems, mainly with the introduction of Dera.\\n\\n\r\nThe series has little plot, but staying true to real slice-of-life, I think that this is befitting of the series. The series is mostly a series of short stories about the things that happen in the community surrounding Tamako\u2019s family and friends, from school to trips to different events that takes places. While there is a underlying plot involving Dera\u2019s original mission, I personally think that this was just used in order to be used to bring the series to a more conclusive ending, though I think that it didn\u2019t make it any more conclusive then it can be.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that made is series for me is the atmosphere that the characters and community produced. They\u2019re personality and mood makes you feel warm and happy as they live on their simple lives in a small neighbourhood. Individually the characters are somewhat stereotypical and not well developed, but as a whole they produced a welcoming and lovely atmosphere for the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters also come with a wide variety, allowing them to have a more vibrant feel. From the various shop owners in the area to Tamako\u2019s friends, to the newcomers in the block, Dera and later his boss, Choi, each of them have their own quirks and personality that helps to build the feel of the story. The main character, Tamako; is a first-year high school girl who is described by Dera as \u201chead with nothing but hair and mocchi\u201d is the sweetheart of the district and is loved by her friends and family. She loves the shopping district and said that she will never leave and her carefree and loving attitudes made her a joy to watch as she felt natural, for me anyway as she lives out her life in the community, having fun and feeding Dera mocchi.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting character in the show is by far Dera, who was added as a supernatural element to the show and also as a comedic mascot. A flamboyant talking bird\u2019s whose name is like a taboo in the Kitashirakawa household as Mocchimazui means \u201cmochi is bad\u201d, despite becoming a stuffed bird due to mochi, so stuffed in fact that he couldn\u2019t continue on with his journey and decided to stay in the area. Dera acted as a sort of catalyst that allows us to explore the lives of the community as he follows Tamako around engages with people in the community. His personality is a bit obnoxious and narcissistic but acts as a comedic joke to lighten the mood.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also Tamako\u2019s family, whose members added little stories to the series, from her father, who was found to have written a song for Tamako\u2019s deceased mother to confess to her while he was young, a song which from the beginning of the series Tamako was trying to find. Then there is her sister, \u201cAn\u201dko; who had her own little section where she dealt with her crush and came to term with her own feelings.\\n\\n\r\nHer friend\u2019s also had a lot of time on screen, from Kanna, daughter of a carpenter who was the series\u2019 joker, always having weird lines in a monotonous voice, to Shiori, a shy girl who as the series progressed made friends with Tamako. Then there is Mocchizou and Midori, the former being Tamako\u2019s childhood friend from across the street who has a deep crush (despite the fact that their fathers are competitors) on her but always fell short of confessing, even so that he took advice from Dera\u2026..The latter is one of Tamako\u2019s closest friends who seem to be very protective of her from others, especially Mocchizou, who she considers as somewhat of a rival.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also various members of the shopping district, each of them vibrant and sweet in their own way. They all love district and is often seen as Tamako and Dera often goes shopping and helps around in the area.\\n\\n\r\nThere were also a few melodramatic moments in the series, but these serve as nothing more than a simple representation of those bad moments in your lives, where you have friends and family to support you, even if the problem is not that big and you may have made it too hard on yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of the series also helped to contribute to the wonderful atmosphere; it made the whole show more lively and natural to me, especially the OP and for some reason the whole thing made me feel like the show was set in the 70s or 80s.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series is a simple and sweet show, and if you want a conclusive storyline then I don\u2019t think that this is for you as it\u2019s just supposed to be a view into the somewhat normal life of a certain group of people and that's what I love about it, being simple and being yourself. As Dera described the town: \u201cEven in days that seem to chill you to the bone, but despite that, you always feel warm right here\u201d. I would describe this series as sitting in the cool spring wind with a cup of tea and eating sweets(maybe mocchi, but I\u2019m not Japanese), nothing extraordinary, nothing great, but just simple warm joy that satisfies your soul.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for listening to my rants, I don\u2019t like to give number scores but if I had to, u can see it above ,No?\\n\r\nBtw, can somebody pls explain to me wat moe is, till today I can\u2019t understand it???\\n",

            "content": "Enter the life of a young girl who lives and breathes life as a devout mochi-maker: what does it look like? Tamako Market gives us a pretty accurate answer, all within a year of foreign visitors coming to \"bride-search\" for a new princess, keeping up friendships at school and boosting the spirits (and sales!) of the local market. Although the story seems quite simple (since it is catered towards a younger audience) and the protagonist is a little towards the shallow edge, I still enjoyed Tamako Market because of the impact of its simplicity and the light-hearted feeling of watching the daily lives of thecharacters play out. It's one of those series that literally lets you step into the local life and see the characters for who they are whilst maintaining the positive vibe of the overall anime.\\n\\n\r\nWe enter the world of Tamako Market when a royal bird named Dera, who is looking for a bride for his foreign prince, gets stuck in Tamako's house by mistakenly believing that Tamako was in love with him (actually he just wants to stay for the mochi haha). The ensuing story is fairly simple in that it explores different situations involving Tamako, her friends and her family (and the rest of the local market) within the backdrop of Dera \"trying\" (he really doesn't try at all, it's just an excuse to stay) to find a bride for his prince. In terms of storyline, it is a pretty standard slice-of-life style anime with episodes about making friends, falling in love, hosting a haunted house and dancing at a cultural festival. But these episodes are still unique in the way they explore the characters, it's a lot more about the characters than the content of the episode.     \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, the story revolves around Tamako, who is a charismatic, but slightly dense, young girl who absolutely loves mochi. Surprisingly Tamako's character can become a little exhausting from an overload of positivity coupled with naivety, but since this series is admittedly geared towards younger girls, the slightly over-optimistic personality can be forgiven. What kept me interested was not just Tamako, but the rest of the characters and their individual troubles: how Anko (her sister) has a secret crush on her friend, how Mochizu (her neighbour) is trying so hard to confess to Tamako, how Tamako's father consolidates his feelings about the past and how Tamako's school friends (who are very different from Tamako) fit together as a group. Then there's the overarching interactions with the local community - I found it heartwarming to see the solidarity of the people in the markets and their support for Tamako and her family. All these character issues might sound childish due to their simplicity, but even where the character stories are simple, it actually makes it easier to appreciate the theme underlying the episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis art is very fitting for that \"kawaii\" kind of feel and there's no denying that the opening theme is one of my favourites: the song, Tamako jumping down from the sky and the dancing markets make me so happy!\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap up, Tamako Market is a sweet anime (literally because of the mochi overload), and I would recommend watching it if you're looking for something simple, but still meaningful and enjoyable.",

            "content": "The \"Cute girls, doing cute things\" has become somewhat of a staple towards the slice of life genre and shows offering such themes have quite evidently been flooding the medium ever since it became a thing. While looking at it from a more basic perspective, Tamako Market, too, belongs under the same theme but quite thankfully offers more to look towards that allow it to stand out from the rest. Though, even considering what it does offer, the real question arises.. Is it enough ?\r\n===Story===\r\nThe story starts out basic enough and is quite easy to digest which works as a plus point for most situations.Now what stems from this is that the show remains easy to pickup, there's no intertwining plot or any such material which would considerably need one to wrap his/her head around. Not to mention that most of the start is pretty episodic thus strengthening the fact that it's easy to pick up at any given time. While it all sounds dandy, this also serves as a disadvantage as there's not really any major plot to consider, which might turn off some viewers. Though there are some story elements which eventually develop into something bigger, it still isn't exactly anything worthy of consideration as it ends up feeling like just another small scenario within a larger collection.\\n\\n\r\n===Art and Animation===\\n\r\nTamako Market delivers fairly well in this regard. The art style is very good, with a bright but soothing color pallet that fits with the theme very nicely. There's also some good attention to detail at points such as characters even showing stray hairs, just to name one such example. Movements are also very well animated which makes the characters look more expressive and puts more life into them. Thankfully, Kyoto Animation does always manage to deliver when it comes to visuals, and Tamako Market was no exception.\\n\\n\r\n===Sound===\\n\r\nTaking into account, the soundtrack first, its a very fitting collection of different tunes. The soundtrack does well to compliment the nature of the show and fits well into the different scenarios that are presented to us. It's nothing I would call exceptional but is indeed a good match for the Anime in question.\\n\r\nNow, if were to look towards the voice acting, I'd say a very good job was done indeed. The characters would not have felt as lively as they did without the efforts of the voice actors, especially towards the main character, I could not help but feel that half of the reason for her cute and innocent flare was due to the voice acting. While I won't say that it was 'Realistic', It was indeed very charming.\\n\\n\r\n===Characters===\\n\r\nThe characters introduced to us in the show are thankfully not the common stereotypes you'd see in most shows, but they're not anything I'd call 'Unique' either. They are however, charming and cute in a more natural way than shown in most other shows within the same genre. While they did come out as charming and did well to provide an enjoyable experience, they were very much lacking in development. For almost the entirety of the show, we almost never really see any of the characters grow in any way, and while there were hints of some deeper backgrounds to some characters, they were never given enough time or the chance to be explored further.\\n\\n\r\n===Presentation===\\n\r\nEven with its issues, the show does indeed provide an enjoyable experience. It has a nice atmosphere to it and does soothe you with its fun scenarios during times when you really don't feel like doing much. The execution and presentation of these scenarios is done well and did manage to get a chuckle or a smile out of me a few times. And even though the plot might seem linear, there are some moments which were somewhat heartwarming and sent out a feel of familiarity during cases some viewers might empathize with. The only bad point I would point out in this aspect is that most scenarios felt discarded due to the show's episodic nature and there were some story elements which needed more explanation but were never given that. Leaving viewers feeling somewhat void by the end.\\n\\n\r\n===Conclusion and Verdict===\\n\r\nI will go by saying that this show isn't for everyone. It either requires people with certain tastes or a good amount of boredom to truly like this show. Even with that said, I would not call it a bad one as it does work as a good show to watch for a change of pace or during times you need something lighthearted and easy to pickup. Because of this, Tamako Market has managed to find a place for itself within the community despite being a pretty mediocre title altogether.",

            "content": "There's something about anime which allows us to derive entertainment from the mundane events of an ordinary person. Coincidentally, ordinary is the best way to describe Tamako Market. \r\nStarring the young lady Tamako and a flamboyant talking bird, Tamako Market is yet another anime that attempts to cash in on the slice of life phenomenon. It is not an anime that prospers through the strength of its plot, setting, or themes, but instead subsists through the cuteness of its characters. Should we criticize an anime for not going beyond that? Maybe not. But there is certainly a problem when such a simple anime still fallsshort of its potential. \\n\\n\r\nTamako Market's biggest weakness is regrettably its characterization. Each characters has about the same depth as wrapping paper, as none of them even once prove to be more than their established archetype. Tamako is merely your ordinary, dense heroine (think Chitanda with pigtails) who is no more memorable than any other generic slice-of-life lead. There is little to make her stand out aside from the fact that she is cute and naive. Even when the story shows small signs of her developing as a character, it will simply fall back on her denseness in order to prevent any growth. The result is not pleasant. You cannot have a character-driven slice-of-life anime told through the perspective of a weak character. It does not work. Though one might think: if not the protagonist, the rest of the cast may be better, right?\\n\\n\r\nNot here, it seems. For nearly all of the side characters are a superfluous addition to an already large cast. The biggest offenders are Tamako's school friends: Midori, Kanna, and Shiori. They do not serve any purpose but to quickly provide a sense of friendship in Tamako's daily life. While there are a couple of episodes that focus on these characters and attempt to give them personality, once the next episode starts, the show will treat it as if nothing even happened. This is especially an issue in the case of Shiori, where an entire episode is spent introducing her to Tamako's group of friends\u2014 yet afterwards she is not seen for almost the entire story. What was the point? You could remove these characters from the show and nothing would change. \\n\\n\r\nTamako's childhood friend, Mochizou, is yet another victim to the weak characterization. His character design at least carries some degree of promise, but the lack of screen time compounded with his unfortunate role as a plot device do not do him any favors. There are a few heartwarming scenes between him and Tamako, such as when they talk at night through a string telephone, but the overall execution of this romance is invariably poor. It is entirely composed of Mochizou woefully attempting to convey his feelings to no avail, with Tamako conveniently being blind to Mochizou's evident feelings. In many ways, their relationship is reminiscent of the cliches from harem anime. To be fair, this isn't a story that focuses on its romance. But can one forgive what could easily have been so much more?  \\n\\n\r\nThe show's mascot, Dera, will either amuse or infuriate you. Considering that he has more screentime than any other character in the story, this can potentially destroy any entertainment value that the show might otherwise hold for the viewer. There are a few witty moments here and there, but most often he is simply detracting from time that could have been better spent developing the human characters. While you may hate him, the one thing that can be said in his favor is that he creates personality within the show: he is anything but a bland character. Whether you lean towards hatred or endearment, Dera will leave some lasting impression on you by the end of the story. Hopefully a positive one. \\n\\n\r\nOn a more positive note is Tamako's younger sister, Anko. She does not receive much screentime in comparison to Tamako or Dera, but what little she receives is written considerably well. Her two episodes focus on the innocent crush that she has towards a classmate, and the way in which the anime conveys this is surprisingly subtle. Anko does not outright state her feelings, but through her body language they are made very clear to the viewer. As well as being sickeningly adorable, Anko is surprisingly the most believable character in the show. Too bad she is treated as irrelevant in all but two episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAside from the characters and romance, there are small problems within the story itself. Most notably is during the last few episodes. After an abrupt twist at the end of the 10th episode, the show immediately tries to rush in some semblance of a story at which it fails quite miserably. Not only does this undermine the slice-of-life aspect of the previous episodes, but the writing is marred by contrivances such as when the Prince somehow travels (or is it 'teleports'?) from a distant country to appear at the most convenient time possible. The ending is scarcely better either as it completely disregards these events in order to revert back to the mundane slice of life. I am not sure that KyoAni knew what kind of anime they wanted to make with Tamako Market. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the content of the show feels uninspired, at least there is some charm in the presentation. There's an interesting contrast between the mundane activities of the shopping district and the unique carnival aesthetic they are presented in. The soundtrack compliments the style of the show especially well, while even the shopkeepers and background characters are given distinct (often eccentric) personalities in order to breathe life into the world. Not that you will remember them, though. \\n\\n\r\nArtistically the anime shines, but those looking for something of the same level as previous KyoAni works will likely find themselves disappointed. The animation is fluid, the facial expressions and scenery are fairly detailed, and the color scheme is vibrant\u2014 though little is actually done to enhance the experience. It is an anime that looks and sounds pleasant, but the lavish budget often feels more excessive than beneficial. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Tamako Market is another disposable slice-of-life anime to be consumed and forgotten. The fundamentals are intact, and while there are still signs of potential waiting to be realized, this is an anime that will probably leave you with a bitter feeling of emptiness once it is over. One would think that after KyoAni's success with K-ON, they would understand what is needed to create a quality slice-of-life anime. Apparently not. Perhaps KyoAni should stick to animating existing material from this point on. \\n\\n\r\nTamako Market may not be a bad anime. But it is certainly a lacking one.",

            "content": "(NOTE: This review is written for general anime fans and assumes no familiarity with other series. If you dislike moe, I still think this series is worth watching, for reasons I will discuss below. After episode 5, I decided to bump up the rating to an 8.)\r\nKyoto Animation is very well known for their cute character designs and on the whole, Tamako Market seems like it was a consummate effort on their part. It's not new and it's not original, but it seems like it was created very easily and with great refinement and polish. \r\nSo what is this series about? Not a lot, ifI'm going to be honest. Tamako is the daughter of a mochi (a kind of Japanese rice cake) maker and the episodes seem to revolve around what kind of new mochi she makes for each different occasion. There's a certain educational appeal in this. \\n\\n\r\nTamako Market also focuses on the bonds Tamako has with her friends and family. It captures the feeling of living in a small yet close-knit community. People from all walks of life populate this town and they all interact with each other in simple yet heartwarming ways. This series is a slice of life in the purest sense of the word.\\n\\n\r\nThe most praiseworthy aspect of the anime is the cozy atmosphere it manages to create. It's as if nothing bad will ever happen in this town. It's definitely escapist - but in a different way from most anime. The world of Tamako Market is one where you want to escape to and live in because it's so simple and innocent. If the world was just a little bit more like the one in Tamako Market, it would be a much better place. That's the appeal in these sorts of shows.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, KyoAni seems to have crafted their ultimate cute girl in our heroine Tamako; she is nice, polite and liked by just about everyone in the series. Though she is not a particularly quirky or memorable character (besides being totally dense when it comes to romance - I pity her love interest), her traits are very balanced and she has an air of genuine sweetness that's impossible to dislike. \\n\\n\r\nI do not think Tamako Market is \"moe pandering\". That is an unfair slight against the anime. Yes, the girls are cute, but so is everyone else in the series, even the old men. One particularly charming episode focused on Tamako's FATHER of all people. If anything, this series is targeted for general audiences and has a family friendly feel. It is not an otaku series and it is not trying to be one. I am neither a moe fan nor a moe hater so I would prefer to look at this series through the merits of its STORYTELLING. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem I detect with this series isn't so much in the content so far but in people's expectations of it. I believe the first episode was not a strong indicator of what the series is about. The first episode was high on energy and comedy, mostly through the slight supernatural aspect of the show. A talking bird is the main comic relief mascot of the show and this character featured prominently in the opening episode. \\n\\n\r\nBut Tamako Market isn't really a screwball comedy, even if it does have a quirky sense of humour. It is really a laid-back sort of anime that takes its time to develop the various characters and let the mood sink in. While the premise of the bird character's subplot reappears in the second half of the series, his main role in the series is for a bit of laughs and to support the character development. The few subplots and promises of development lead to nothing in the end, and while it's not necessarily a bad thing to see a story that isn't so focused on a tight storyline, Tamako Market feels particularly light and frothy, all the more so because what plot it manages to build up is deemed irrelevant by the end.\\n\\n\r\nTamako Market sets itself up to be one thing and turns out to be something else. I do consider this to be a flaw in the writing. Even slice of life fans should take note that the dialogue isn't particularly witty and the charm comes across as somewhat calculated. As I said before, it's not moe pandering, but there's a certain \"been there, done that\" aspect to a few of the more emotional scenes - most likely because seasoned anime fans may have already seen them done in previous KyoAni shows, or just in anime in general. That doesn't stop this series from being good at what it does, but there is a distinct feeling that it could have been stronger. Some episodes do drag in their pacing.\\n\\n\r\nStill, it's a nice slice of life show, very clean and perfectly harmless, even though it doesn't do anything new with the genre. Do give it a shot.",

            "content": "Do you like MOE? Are you a fan of Kyoto Animation's other works? Do you enjoy watching cute girls doing cute things? Do you like a talking bird running his narcissistic mouth 24/7 about his superiority and the world around him? Well, if any of those registers a response of \u201cyes\u201d, then this series might be somewhat of an interest for you.\r\nTamako Market is a new original series from Kyoto Animation. The series is directed by Naoko Yamada with the studio known for their other works such as Clannad, Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!, Hyouka, and K-On! The series is a standalone title with noother adaptations from any sources of LN/Manga as of known. Now, I admit, this series is a quite something especially in the 'kawaii' department. But beyond that, I'm not sure if Tamako Market lives up to the hype and humor that I originally thought it had.\\n\\n\r\nWell, the series lacks a direct story but takes on a more slice of life style of things in more of the fun way. Take for example, we got that bird named Dera \u201cTori\u201d Mochimazzi (if that even its real name). He claims himself as being \u201cnoble\u201d with a sharp tongue and often talks in an aristocratic pattern. He also seems to be dense of the real world and how it functions. For instance, he takes the girls' actions of colliding into his face as a way of \u201cdeclaring their devotion\u201d towards him. In reality, this is obviously not the case but only a case of allergy. It happens quite often too and Dera being the silly bird that he is takes everything in the way his culture taught him to be. \\n\\n\r\nAs for most of the other characters, the series presents them in the usual cute way, the Kyoto Animation way. There's Tamako Kitashirakawa who stars as the main protagonist of the series. She is a first year student in high school who is enjoying the time of her life. Despite her denseness especially to those in her life, she is very hardworking and strives to help out her family the best way she can. In fact, she is easily able to make friends at school and even at earned the affections (or maybe I should assume here to be accidental fondness) of Dera. Tamako is the main star of the series and hell, even some girls got the hots for her.\\n\\n\r\nAmong some of her friends includes her childhood friend Midori, Kanna (a member of the Baton club), as well as the cool girl Shiori. Oh and let's not forget the guy friend, Mochiz\u014d \u014cji. It is hinted throughout the series that he has a thing for Tamako but who are we kidding here, it's Tamako after all and she gives 'dense' a whole new meaning. In fact, there is even a sort of \u201clove triangle\u201d. Unfortunately, it is quite weak and blend that most viewers will not be able to notice it much. Even so though, the characters all have different personalities as well as what they hope to be in the future. They just seem to be too simple and not enough depth. Given the premise of the show and its genres, it's not too surprising in the case of Tamako Market.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the adults of this show (besides Tamako's cool dad) seems to be more in the background. In this show, the kids are the stars and the adults are the ones on the other horizon. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, this show is rather plot less and lacks any if at all, strong development. In other words, don't go into this series with some sort of strong story because the way it's being handled. However, there are some little things that are amusing to reference to if a viewer pays more careful attention. Most of Tamako's family members' names are related to mochi as well as having meanings. For example, Dela Mochimazzi hates to eat mochi. His last name reflects on the 'mochi is terrible' taste in which he dislikes the taste of mochi. Tamako is also born on New Years Eve which just happens to be the busiest time of the year so her birthday is often forgotten. Well, at least it's better than February 29.\\n\\n\r\nThe series' episodes typically spotlights a certain event in Tamako's daily life as well as spotlighting some of the other characters (including that bird Dela). Even Tamako's little moe sister Anko gets her own episode when she demands to be called \u201cAn!\u201d Shiori had her moments during her own spotlight as she made an impression for Tamako and her friends. Now, they are the best of friends. I won't get to that bird Dera since he tries to steal the show (like he did with the first episode) every week. I do find him quite annoying though as his mouth never seems to stop talking about his ethnics and culture. \\n\\n\r\nAt many stances, I find this series to be cute. We have the Tin-to-Phone talk as a little theme to bring back some childhood nostologia. I mean, ask yourself, when was the last time you talked to someone with a tin can? Nowadays, we got cell phones, androids, and whatever else you watch your anime on. But going back to the old school of using old fashioned tin cans is just something so nostologic. Not only that, it is cute. Among other things, there is a sense of innocence especially with Tamako. Those headbands on her hair and the way she displays her postures in the OP song are all part of this. In fact, Tamako is one of those girls that you can't help but want to be friends with. For Anko's case, her seemingly crush on a fellow classmate turned out to be someone else that most of the cast did not see coming. It's one of those instances where innocence kicks in again and we can't help but smile for Anko; or maybe, I should call her 'An' as she wants to be called.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all cutesy moments and fun, the series does have some dramatic moments and even a somewhat antagonist of the series. This is reflected in the face of Kanna Makino when she has some plans of her own against Midori. Otherwise, some of the drama involving Anko and her classmates are occasionally a pleasant watch. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this show does not escape the typical beach episode. Although not for fan service reasons (I think?), there is a beach episode where the main characters relax and have fun in the sun. It's been done by Kyoto Animation in the past before and here we are again. Otherwise, the series' blend storyline does not make up for its other attributes. Also, that damn bird named Dela tries to steal the show every single episode. He's almost everywhere whether it's on Tamako's head, at the beach, the mochi shop, or at school. He tries to be the star of the series but more often or not, he stays as the comic relief. This is reflected in his personality and the way he behaves himself where the only attention he gets is seemingly what he least expected. He claims to be some kind of aristocratic prince but let's face reality here folks, he is just a flat bird with not even an ounce of hunting skills considering the place he is freeloading in. Talk about being worthless, just like the 'plot'.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, Kyoto Animation does it again. The series has very rich scenery and displays fantastic features of the characters' expressions. The luscious backgrounds along with its strong balance of artistry sets this series as a top tier in the art department. More so though, Tamako Market gives more of a realistic feeling of what is being like in the show. There's the beach, the mochi shop, the neighborhood, and school. It works out right and along with the character designs, we can clearly see that Kyoto Animation is behind this. I mean, just take a close look at Tamako's face. Aren't you CURIOUS about what mystery series' female protagonist that Kyoto Animation worked on previously from where she resembles from?\\n\\n\r\nFor soundtrack, I would say that the ED song is quite catchy. It is playable on repeat and seems like an orchestra that is crafted with a fast rhythm and catching pace. Most of the soundtrack is composed of that lighthearted tone with some added fun choirs in between. The voice actors did an okay job to reflect their tone style although there's a certain character in the series that seems to display some gender confusion. More noticeably though, Tamako's dad displays some musical skills of his own and a few of the background music later on seems to be based off of famous works.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think this series gets a '6'. If I was judging it based on cuteness, I would score it something like a 15/10. However, the weak story and seemingly lack of character development makes it less convincing against some other titles from Kyoto Animation's works. That bird by the name of Dera (again, is this even his real name?) is quite annoying and gets repetitive to watch. I do admit though that the series is quite cute and brings a smile to my face whenever I watch it. This time around, I'm not sure if Tamako Market is really that good. Well, it definitely is kawaii.\\n",

In fact, the cuteness is played up to such a level that all you see, all you notice, is cute. The animation is bright and bubbly and perfectly moe; it fits an anime of this caliber and deserves praise for setting the stage. The voice acting and music will not disappoint. On the outside, Tamako Market is glorious and if one is content with this then good enough for them. But for those of us who begin to question the cuteness, for those of us who find that the cuteness isn\u2019t enough to stop critical analysis, a deeper look is in order. For the sake of this review, I will break through Tamako Market\u2019s fa\u00e7ade. There are few layers beneath. Actually, it\u2019s painfully simple, even more so than some other slice of life anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the bubbly aura that the animation and music emanates, Tamako Market feels uninspired and, weirdly enough, even bland. This isn\u2019t because it\u2019s a slice of life anime. In fact, anime of this genre often have an inexplicably entertaining quality despite the commonplace happenings. Where other similar anime stand strong, fortified by character chemistry and those signature quirky events, Tamako Market can\u2019t seem to establish itself. Everything is there to create another wonderful edition to the world of moe\u2014right? Actually, no. The deeper parts of moe and slice of life, the parts that leave a good anime fan satisfied, are not merely looks but what\u2019s on the inside. It\u2019s just like the question of best girl. She may have to be cute, but there are a lot of cute girls and when it comes down to it, her heart matters more. \\n\\n\r\nFor anime, the heart is something known as plot and characterization.\\n\\n\r\nTamako Market starts off pretty well, introducing us to the cool and friendly place where Tamako lives and Dera, a pompous bird that she just happens to encounter. The story basically revolves around Tamako\u2019s daily life with this bird, her friends, and mochi. The one thing that Tamako Market tells us consistently is that mochi is great, mochi is good, and mochi is life. Otherwise, everything is loosely about friendship, family, and some sort of plot revolving around Dera that comes in when it wants to, only to be remembered when convenient and then sloppily handled at the end. For some, the amount of moe cuteness is enough; getting absorbed in it is fine for them. But the reason why all you see is cuteness and the reason why there\u2019s so much of it is because there isn\u2019t anything else. The best thing that Tamako Market could do was play that up, and it definitely did that. However, those of us looking for something deeper will only be content in watching this anime (though that does not mean they won\u2019t enjoy the ride) instead of absorbing all that it has to offer. Tamako and her friends are the only thing that would make this anime remotely interesting\u2014and that fact doesn\u2019t fare well for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe dialogue is bland, the jokes are bland (and barely noticed), the crushes are bland (and very badly handled), and the characters (especially the ones with the most screen time) are bland. The latter is the reason why the former is bland. The characters that had promise on episode one bore you by episode twelve because they\u2019re exactly the same. The archetypes that you were introduced to don\u2019t have any deeper facts, quirky characteristics, or new emotions to show you that twelve episodes have passed. Where many slice of life anime keep you interested with facts or entertaining life stories or at least a deeper kind of characterization, Tamako Market doesn\u2019t stretch its legs. All of them are insipidly themselves\u2014Tamako is forever cute and na\u00efve, Kanna is forever unusual, Midori is forever bubbly-ish. In fact, perhaps unsurprisingly, but definitely unfortunately, the most interesting and promising characters are the ones with the least amount of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why Tamako Market fails to inspire praise is because it doesn\u2019t handle itself well. Though another (not implausible) reason is that perhaps it thinks it doesn\u2019t need to, so long as there\u2019s cuteness. Many will agree with that and many anime veterans will not.\\n\\n\r\nLook in each corner, my friends. In one, we have cuteness, the appealing shell. In the other, we have a gray, murky goop, the unappetizing innards. The question of which one will win can only be answered by you, the viewer.",

            "content": "\u201cYou used to be much more... \"muchier\". You've lost your muchness.\u201d - Alice in Wonderland.\r\nNot that I'm a fan of that series, nor that I even know the story (please don't shoot me), but this perfectly describes studio Kyoto in a ball. They've been famous for making various key adaptions such as Clannad and Kanon, and other series being described as far as controversial like Haruhi. But lately, they've been said that the rising hill is sloping downwards now, and Tamako Market contributes to more evidence for that hill, with less and less 'muchness'. That hill consists of weaker attention for the story, and withmore delicious amount of budget and moe to sprinkle the... fillings, not just the topping. That's right, it's the infamous \"style over substance\" type, and Tamako Market went exactly in that route. It'd be really nice to have a good balance of substance, but that doesn't mean we should completely ignore the style either, and it's styles like in Tamako Market that are actually pretty rare.\\n\\n\r\nHence why I used Alice in Wonderland for quoting.\\n\\n\r\n'Tamako Market' means a market full of Tamakos. Just kidding, but please stop laughing at my hilarious well-made joke which was carefully crafted in three whole seconds. It does take place in a market though, and a rather lively one at that. There's several mochi shops rivaling each other, and a high school girl named 'Tamako' is part of the shops. She looooves mochi, and makes 'em for the market who has the happiest atmosphere going around. Also talking bird appears and strange love triangles occur, whilst the mochi shops does the most epic contests against one another, rivaling themselves out with their wild mochi-cooking skills to the point of exhaustion and hardships.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I lied, there's no real cooking rivalry. There's talking birds though.\\n\\n\r\nAs a complete, shocking surprise, it's about nothing, or at least for the majority of the time. However, the way it structures itself gives both an avoid alert and a treat for those for can bear the first few episodes. My initial first response to the first three episodes were that they were \"boring as a wall\", as well as \"stupid as a talking bir- oh wait\". Nothing happens, and it seems a little pretentious with a smiley face to try and keep me engaged with a talking bird hitting on girls. It's only after I finally picked up the series again when it was nearing its end on airing, where the episodes after three actually became a little more than entertaining. It's ironic because, for those of you who follow the three episode rule, you'd be only watching the lowest of the TM episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe structure follows a episodic layout, and it's not surprising as it's a slice of life. They're purely episodic to the core though, as they each contain stories of both main and side characters, dealing with simple problems and affection towards different people and such. This kind of layout already sets you up with the characters in front of you, and since the story doesn't follow a linear line, not much changes or developments grow much, if it has any at all. With that said, it allows you to familiarize yourself with the happy market, and as you get more into the market's pace, you'd find it gets much more enjoyable and natural with different kinds of stories later on.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it can go the opposite effect if you're not fond with the market itself. If you feel the urge to burn those flowers in the shop, that fat talking bird who didn't save the show, those puffy mochi-like cheeks on Tamako and those puffy mochis themselves, then feel free to get up and leave to collect your fire, as you're not going to like the show at all. Don't burn Kanna's hammer though, Kanna's the best in the show. How dare you.\\n\\n\r\nBut I'd be a little surprise for anyone to hate the atmosphere of the anime, particularly the market. I find the atmosphere to be a little more... magical. Which is a little bit of a surprise myself, since I don't tend to find this sort of lovely, bouncy atmosphere in anime often now. The show presents itself in a more musical-play fashion rather than a relaxing one. Things play out like a fantasy musical, if there's anything else to describe it best; the lovely, light soundtrack fleshes the musical style out quite a bit, as some scenes feel as though it's actually a music video. Things flow like flipping through a happy and merrily written book, sometimes ending in a fashion where a message warps up the episode as if it actually ends a good night sleep. It's a lovely atmosphere, and gives a tingly sensation of joy inside... though, it takes a bit of time until it really gets into you (at least after episode 3 for me).\\n\\n\r\nOh, did I ever tell you there was actually a story in the show?\\n\\n\r\nDera, the bird who I just called 'the bird' for a while now, actually comes to the country for a specific reason. That background of the story stays behind the shadows for the majority of the show though, so the reasoning for him lurking in the market isn't because he tried to make a 'moe slice of life about nothing' show more interesting, but for a future reason to be revealed later on. The storyline of the whole situation with Dera isn't so surprising though, and in fact it's fairly simple to get your head around without the need of developments or plot twists. It's ever so simple writing, with a vague climax that doesn't really make up for the entire series, so if you're expecting your wow meter to be of the chart, don't be.\\n\\n\r\nThat and the fact the actual story is literally behind the shadows doesn't keep any sort of substance following, since it's pretty much hidden in the entire series. There's not even a sense of mystery either; the market's being too busy smiling so much that a fat bird that can talk is something that should be subjected upon, since even scientists can't find birds in the world who can freaking talk, let alone a noble perverted one. The point though is that it's a super simple story which doesn't get put on subject until the few last episodes of the show, and so the rest of the episodes is just about character stories in the market, as said earlier. There's no linear story to follow; only those in the market.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about the lovely dovely production values for now, and take a break of the main cake of the show. What do you expect from Kyoto Animation then? In comparison to ChuChu and Hyouka, the budget doesn't go as astounding as those two. It's more comparable to the likes of K-On!! though, as they are done by the same sub-team as each other. The animation is very fluent with its movement, making them extremely fun to watch and building up a good amount of gif files in your folders. The main girls are in the baton club too; what's more fun than looking at cute girls throwing and spinning batons around in the hall? Also, there's quite a blob of moe in the anime, though it's not focused upon as much as people state it is. If you are allergic to moe and get itchy spots down there, you can stay away from this, but I honestly don't see how or why it's a big problem for the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is ever so musically lovely. I wish the OST is already out, but it seems like it only goes as far as the character songs for download. Anyway, the soundtrack provides the magical atmosphere even further, and fits the entire show almost perfectly, as said earlier. The opening contributes to the magic musical style too, though not so much of the ED as that's more of a J-Pop serious song. It's not much of a problem, since it's musically very well-done, and it's a must-have to get the full version of. Sound effects and directing is consistently good, and the OST is used wonderfully, fitting from a cute AMV to a mini musical narration play thingymajigy, as described earlier. Voice acting is great too, and Dera's voice gives of the royalty feel of his being quite well. Well... mostly royalty.\\n\\n\r\nBut umm... about Dera....\\n\\n\r\nSome say he's the life saver of the anime, whilst others state he's a big, fat thing wasting precious screen time for the anime. In theory, he's only set in the market because of plot (oh how convenient!), right? But, as said three main paragraphs ago, the actual story is bored behind the shadows, so Dera's not actually needed 9 tenths of the time. His personality is of a king's noble servant, yet he's not aware that all his 'charm' are not actually capturing any of the girls' hearts at all. Even mochi proves him as a clown, turning him bloated and heavy. He's in the show listed as a main character, but it's in fact that he only proves to be a comedic clown character who can in fact be super annoying to some and praise-worthy to others.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not he saves the entire show is an entirely different question. Without him, Tamako Market would be a normal slice of life about mochis, lesbians and magical happy atmosphere floating around. It can only prove Dera as a little bit of a plot device to bring the \"plot\" to the market, but even without him the effects of being bored as a brick in the first few episodes would be the same. His existence is very polarizing in opinions because of his strange noble personality, with a sense of weird affection birds shouldn't even have towards girls, and sometimes he just kills moments by narrating with a somewhat cheesy voice. That said, if you really hate to see him, he's hardly the center of attention in the majority of the time, so be glad or be sad; either way, this talking bird isn't going to leave his mochi behind you'd still have to deal with him in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAside the case of the talking bird though, there's a whole cast of other characters too. You got the group of girls being Tamako's friends (Tamako being the main character, if you haven't noticed), who are blond Midori, glasses Shiori and the best character in the entire show, Kanna. Her ruler and hammer wins me over, and so she proves best award for Tamako Market person. The market has a ton of people living there; a flowerist whose gender is unknown, other mochi makers and shop keepers plus the families, the friendly elderly people, dancing old man, newly bird couple, little kids and so on. It's quite a colourful bunch, and the entire cast brings the happy and lively atmosphere in the area, so lively that it's a little unnatural to be in, but nevertheless fun. Several of the characters get a decent amount of screen time, but not much can be said about the developments. They're pretty interesting and likable in their own right, especially having the center of attention in some of the episodes (though Kanna doesn't weep weep...). The cast is a fun bunch, in conclusion, but even with some background and attention, development doesn't really grow upon nearly all of them (except Dera, funny enough).\\n\\n\r\nTamako Market can be regarded as another moe creation from Kyoto, and with even more style and less substance than before. Popularity sure got them \"muchier\", but now their muchness has shrunk over the years to the point where great things wave bye-bye to their opportunities of potential (talking about that one Key VN which got rejected because Kyoto was 'too busy'... forever cry weep weep...). That all said, Tamako Market wasn't as bad of a ride than I thought it'd be, but stating that the story is extremely unique and well-written is worth face-palming.\\n\\n\r\nI wonder what Kyoto's going to do in the future then. And should I look forward to it?",

Before you watch Tamako Market, you should read this review.\r\nIt's obviously that specific genres of anime are often intensely focused on a certain genders and age groups, including a female protagonist with her friends. In fact, KyoAni giving many adorable scene to made the fans adore their cuteness. There's one alternative different anime, had same producers like K-ON!. ( Kyo Ani. Why.)  This story is mostly apparent when one considers the slice of life and comedy category.\r\nThis all seem to have several things in common - cute characters, adorable face, a funny face,\"cute\" costume changes then.. a fat bird APPEARS! I can say this anime looks funny. I'd rather to give my grateful for this anime because many people always looking at their art and characters, a good storyline. If you really likes Dandere, A bit tsundere, cheerful female protoganist, and you have it. I've read your mind. It was like you want to say; \"I wanna to take the girls in my home. then HNNNNNNNNNGG.\"\\n\\n\r\nBack to main topic, there is a \"can't resist the moeness\" girl named Tamako Kitashirakawa, A first-year in high school student whose family runs a mochi shop in their town's shopping district, She helps her family run the shop and invent new various of mochi. the shopkeepers loves them. ( Everyone loves Tamako. *Thumbs up*) along with her two best friend. Midori and Kanna. Fortunately, there's one guy who fall in love with Tamako. You have no regret to watch this. So it's a good thing theanime is as entertaining as it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest is yours. I ended my review. Thank you.",

            "content": "Tamako Market may be derived from the same recipe as KyoAni's other SOL anime, but its taste is a little off.\r\nAs always, my reviews are spoiler free.\r\nKyoto Animation, the makers of the wildly successful Haruhi and K-On! series, realized something a few months after K-On! finished airing.  Cute girls doing cute things (afterwards CGDCT; call it \"moe\" if you want to, that's another argument entirely) really sells.  The following seasons, and to the day that this review is being written, there have been dozens of series that tried to ride the CGDCT wave all the way to the bank.  Most have triedto stand out from the crowd by adding a unique flavor, but in the end it's obvious that they are just trying to scrape up a little more of K-On!'s success.  Most have faded into obscurity, but one that is just trying to keep its head above water is Tamako Market.\\n\\n\r\nChief among the culprits of these \"copies\" are KyoAni themselves; aside from K-On!! (more ! means more seasons), they released a continuous string of SOL/CGDCT (or CBoysDCT in Free!'s case) with Kyoukai no Kanata being the only break in sight.  Among these was Tamako Market, the subject of review today.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nTo begin, here is the short and simple premise:  Tamako is a high school girl whose family runs a mochi shop.  One day she meets a talking bird from a faraway island who is in search of a bride for his prince.  \\n\\n\r\nLet's put the premise aside for a moment though.\\n\\n\r\nSOL anime are very difficult to approach in the story category.  Rather than a near-objectively good story (such as Steins;Gate) or near-objectively poor story (such as Skelter Heaven), a SOL story has a \"feel\" to it.  A personal favorite of mine is the Aria series, giving an overarching sense of serenity as the characters go about their lives in a beautiful setting.  Even when restricted to high school life, as so many SOLs are, one can find much better \"feelings,\" such as Azumanga Daioh or Hyouka.  Each has their own unique charm or interesting characters that draw the viewer in.  The problem with Tamako Market is that it doesn't have charm or interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe charm that it tried to present was a combination of the talking bird, Dera, and some manor of suppressed romantic subplot around Tamako.  Neither one is anywhere close to interesting enough to save the biggest problem in the series: the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni is not one to slack on the animation budget.  All of their recent works are above average in the animation and art department, especially Hyouka.  However, compared with each recently animated series, Tamako Market gives off a \"good enough\" feeling.  Those backgrounds are \"good enough.\"  Those side character designs were \"good enough.\"  That fluidity was \"good enough.\"  It's hard to fool a KyoAni fan when they see what the studio is capable of with releases such as Disappearance and Hyouka.  Even the previous season's Chuunibyou was leagues ahead.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series is below average effort from a far above average studio, but it looks as good or better than most comparable series.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe backing tracks were good and upbeat. The OP was catchy and fun.  However, the real thing I want to mention here are the voice actors and actresses.  This series used many brand new seiyuu, and they did a great job.  They need to get more roles.  \\n\\n\r\nThis was well above the standard of most similar series, but still not up to the bar of K-On! or Hyouka.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where things really went wrong.  Let's do a roll call...\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast:\\n\\n\r\n-Tamako, the world's densest girl who is always smiling and optimistic to a near-creepy degree.  She loves nothing in the world more than mochi, which is probably why she can never notice the obvious advances of her friends Mochizou and Midori.  She has no other features at all.\\n\r\n-Kanna, who is as poker-faced as Tamako is smiley.  She does not appear to have emotions or react to many stimuli.  She is just a token friend.\\n\r\n-Midori, the closet lesbian.  She shows obvious romantic interest throughout the series that Tamako never notices.  Other than being token friend #2, she tries to \"protect\" Tamako from the romantic advances of others, as if she needs more protection than her denseness.\\n\r\n-Dera, the stuck up bird comic relief.  He will be very polarizing, with some viewers loving his aloof humor and others hoping Dera hunting season will soon open in Japan.  He also has a video-phone feature.\\n\r\n-Choi, the bride hunting brown girl.  She arrives in Japan from a small island kingdom, coming after Dera.  She is often harsh for no reason, especially to Dera, as she is his handler.  She can use him in some sort of divination ritual.  She believes Tamako may the bride for her island's prince.\\n\r\n-Mochizou, who likes Tamako too.  He is from the mochi shop right across the street (capitalism ho!).  He constantly tries to confess to Tamako, but it is like trying to explain your love to a rock.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast consists of many characters who are mainly family members or store owners.  They all serve their sole purpose to populate the world or fill a space in the story.\\n\\n\r\nIf you think I am summarizing character personalities, I'm not.  I have written full biographies for each of them.  They are incredibly boring.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy Tamako Market because of the boring setting and the \"feeling\" I talked about earlier.  I've seen hundreds of similar shows, and Tamako Market falls right into the \"average\" category.  The only reason it hasn't been forgotten like other K-On! chasers like A-Channel is that it was made by the same studio.\\n\\n\r\nOther Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni is one of my favorite studios, but I think they really dropped the ball on this one.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many, many better CGDCT/SOL shows that you could watch.  Do yourself a favor and give this one a miss.  Take a look at K-ON!, Aria, Hyouka, Chuunibyou, Tamayura, Haruhi, Yuru Yuri, Azumanga Daioh or any other of the dozens of better series of this nature.",

            "content": "This time KyoAni surprised me with stuff and things. THINGS. \r\nThere has been quite a lot of criticism about how Tamako Market is nothing but a slice of life moe silliness. I, however, spotted quite a few things which I think should come to the knowledge of others in case not everyone notices THINGS.\r\nTamako Market has a strong position taking message about moe and cuteness in generally. It's rather simple, actually. Tamako Market is an anime about nothing. Tamako Market is cute. And thus nothing =is= cute. Self-irony much? I think this is pretty much a big deal considering that majority (read;all) KyoAni shows areconsidered cute. Also moe = mochi over everything. Deep and lots of THINGS.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing that has been bugging so many is this series is the originality. Talking pimp bird who is secretly a video projector? Nigga whose ass looks like a peach? Has been done before? I don't thinks so. Eva didn't do it. Logh tried but failed. In my eyes it is very original, and peach-like. \\n\\n\r\nThere sureasfuckinghell was no inbetween. The animation in this series was reversally made. Pretty sure majority has seen some crazy-ass amount of .gif's about cute girls doing cute THINGS and whatnot. Tamako Market often looks like a collection of those. The characters are jumping and teleporting all over the screen without any sense, making the series look like a .gif slide show. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, themes and bgm are all quite fitting to the series. Though, I still don't know if that one blond who likes flowers is really female because she(?) really sounds like a dude. Trapsome pick there I guess.\\n\\n\r\nThis series made me feel kinda happy and smile and STUFF. I really wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants to see something good and amazing because this is neither, but I think anyone who wants to see something light without overwhelming amount of moe and melodrama could enjoy this STUFF.",

            "content": "I've had a close eye turned toward Kyoto Animation since Haruhi and Lucky Star, Nichijou and K-On! are all anime I would count among my favorites. Needless to say I wasn't going to be able to stay away from a Kyoto Animation produced show from many of the people who brought us the last of those forever. K-On! was a fun, lovable, funny, sweet anime with a set of characters who could be described in equal terms. I expected similar things from Tamako Market and to an extent that is what I received, though the packaging was quite a bit different that I was expecting.\r\nMostof the shows I name dropped above had a certain formula. They focus on four-five high school students, mostly girls, trading elliptical comic dialogs, doing cute things and engaging in some manner of mischief or silliness. It's a working formula; one that allows a show to easily entertain while keeping the focus tight so the characters can be developed. Tamako market has a set of four cute and somewhat quirky high school girls, but they're not actually where the focus is at all. The focus quite fittingly enough is on one girl, Tamako, and the market where she lives and works. Oh, and some weird talking bird too.\\n\\n\r\nThis is kind of an odd approach. It takes away from the humor potential some. It gives the show a lot of work to do, more than it can possibly hope to do or even try to do with twelve episodes. It's unusual, especially if the goal was to repeat the success of K-On!. I can't actually see this show doing that as a result. However, for what it is, Tamako Market just oozes a lot of charm. It's an easy series to like.\\n\\n\r\nPart of that is that KyoAni have made another great looking anime. It doesn't have as much great visual flourish as they brought to Nichijou, mind you, but this show doesn't really need all that. It's a fairly understated series, and the animators do a good job of setting just the right tone. Character designs are distinctive and attractive yet generally believable. On the sound end, most of the actors do a pretty good job and music is well utilized at points. The OP and ED are both rather charming and cute, though a little less memorable than KyoAni's best themes.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the plot to Tamako Market is tied to its characters, and they are an interesting cast. The main character, Tamako herself, is an odd main character. She's rather ordinary. Somewhat dense and excitable, but put her next to someone like Yui from K-On and she's downright understated. She's a hardworking, cheerful, bright-eyed girl and that's really all there is to her. I could see this same character being a well-liked minor supporting character in practically any other anime. I think that's likely the point though; she's universal, she's believable and she's easy to like, both by the viewer and the characters. She doesn't develop noticeably as a character all too much through the show, but it's clear she touches the other characters in certain ways.\\n\\n\r\nTamako has two romantic interests, not that she seems very aware of either of their advances. One is Mochizou, the son of the shop which is rival to her family's shop. The other is Midori, Tamako's best friend from childhood who is beginning to realize her feelings for Tamako are deeper than normal friendship. It's an interesting setup, but nothing ever really come of it. Mochizou isn't developed much beyond just being a likable and good natured everyman. Midori's feelings are conveyed effectively and believably without dwelling on them excessively, but are never really confronted directly. More could have been done with these two, but as it is any potential dramatic tension there is ignored.\\n\\n\r\nRounding out the school girl set with Tamako and Midori are Kanna and Shiori. Kanna is the one of the bunch who probably could actually fit in a more K-On! type show; she's hilarious and a bit of an oddball and is delightful whenever she's around. Shiori is the shy one who at first seems cold; while cute and having a good design, she gets a bit lost in the shuffle after her episode and ends up being a character without much place in the story. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Tamako's family and the shopping district. The family is pretty well done. Tamako's younger sister is a very believable child character with her own little arc. Tamako's father also ends up being a very well developed and likable character, who seems to grow through the story more than a lot of characters. The other shop keepers in the market don't get much time individually to be developed, but the designs are good and the warm, familiar way they're constantly being portrayed makes them quite likable as well. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the bird. I'm not entirely sure what to make of Dera. He's an odd character, and one that steals the focus a lot. He's perhaps supposed to be the source of most of the comedy in the series, and in that capacity he does have his moments, particularly when he and Kanna interact. He is a character who it's easy to get too much of though, and at times it does seem like the show would be better if he was shoved away somewhere for a while. Of course he's also the instigator of the overarching \"plot\" of Tamako Market for what it is, but not much comes of that save another fairly fun and cute character, Choi, being brought to the show for the second half.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is very likable on a whole and there are spots of good character development. The show just seems unable to get to everything it should, and for that it suffers some. However, while KyoAni doesn't have another masterpiece on their hands, they do have what I'd still call a very good anime. It has a few flaws and could have just generally used more episodes to do more with its setup and characters, but Tamako Market remains a quite enjoyable offering all the same.",

            "content": "Tamako Market, your seemingly storyless moe anime variety. I don't exactly remember what made me start this, but I loved it near instantly. I'm actually really disappointed that this wonderful anime is over, and I very much would love a second season. Yes, TM's cute. Does it have no story? Is it pointless? To answer those questions it'd be a heck no! It has it's both sad and heartwarming scenes, and more.\r\nTM's story is simple; a girl, Tamako, works at a mochi shop with her father, sister, and grandfather. Across the street is a rival mochi shop and home of a boy, Mochizou, who's interestedin the oblivious Tamako. The story is of Tamako's life in both the shop, a bit of her school life, along with her two good friends. In the midst of all this, a strange talking bird appears to Tamako, and tells her he is here to find a bride for his prince. There's a decent amount of humor included. Another fact is that my younger cousins who are definitely NOT into moe, who play FPS and strategy games all the time, ENJOY this anime. TM is a simple, but heartwarming and sweet one story. If you're like me, it's able to give you feels. Happy emotions, bittersweet emotions, sad ones... this anime is able to pack many feelings into one.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this show is of course by KyoAni, so it should seem familiar. The animation is fluid, the colors are bright, warm, and cold; it's high quality. However, anatomy-wise, it might be a little bit less accurate than K-ON!, especially with all of the characters' legs, and this applies to 99% of everyone. The female characters' hands are really small and inconsistent, and at times are either too small, other times, they're actually correctly drawn. It's not too big of an issue, though. Expressions are well-done, and lively. All in all, the animation is pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending for Tamako Market are amazing. The colorful, upbeat op is a lively tune. The song matched the op sequence very well. The ending, stunning, and very catchy to boot. I find it stuck in my head, often... the seiyu for Tamako sings both of these, and she is a pretty good vocalist! The voice acting for TM is great- the cast's voices match very well. Even the bgm's great- matching, quirky, catchy songs. Love the music for TM.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters of this show, I find unique and lovable. Tamako is just darling and it's hard to not love her. Her friends are also unique, and have nice quirks to them. I adore both Tamako and Kanna, her brown-haired, measurement enthusiast friend. The shopping district residents are colorful, and they're all depicted very, very warmly, and are all individuals of their own right. We can't forget Dera, the characteristic bird who comes to visit. Also a lovable \"character\" indeed.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoy Tamako Market, even when I thought I wouldn't. It's one of the most promising series for this season for me, so you can imagine how much I like it. Every time a new episode arrives, I get really excited and smiles appear on my face no matter how down I feel. A great anime to go to if you're not feeling very happy, or you're down in the dumps.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, you should watch this anime if you don't mind lightheartedness and slice of life. This anime is the one I very eagerly wait to see every week this entire season. It's a warm and sweet story, so please enjoy!",

It has a total of 12 episodes and has already been licensed by Sentai Filmworks.\r\nGenre: Comedy, Slice of Life, School Life, Cooking\r\nPlot: 7/10\r\nThe story revolves around Tamako Kitashirakawa, a normal high school girl that\u2019s working in her family\u2019s mochi shop. She enjoys her everyday school life with her friends, the work in the mochi shop and in general her life as a member of the town\u2019s shopping district.\r\nOne day an unexpected guest arrives, Dera Mochimazzwi, a talking bird, a royal one on top of that, arrivesfrom a faraway place to announce his plan of searching for the perfect bride for his prince. Finding a liking to the Kitashirakawa family and most of all to their mochi, Dera ends up staying a little longer, becoming a freeloader in their home.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSounds a little weird huh? It\u2019s actually a very odd mix of a totally normal group of friends, enjoying their everyday school life and a totally unusual talking bird on a royal mission. But as crazy as this combination may sound, it is first of all, very enjoyable and interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s be honest, you don\u2019t have to think about much watching this anime, I would even say you can just shut off your brain and watch this without thinking about anything at all. And since this is like 80% Tamako\u2019s normal school life and 20% bossy bird talking and eating mochi, this is like the perfect show to watch in between those ones that you need to actually pay close attention to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nTamako Kitashirakawa:  She is the protagonist of the Anime and the oldest daughter of the Kitashirakawa family. Since her mother passed away when she was still little, she is now living with her younger sister, her father and her grandfather, working in their family\u2019s mochi shop. While Tamako is hardworking, always helping out in the shop and in general the portrayal of the perfect daughter, she can at times be a complete airhead that is totally oblivious to her surroundings.\\n\\n\r\nDera Mochimazzwi: As an attendant, but primarily a member of a royal family of a faraway tropical island, Dera is ordered to find his prince\u2019s bride. Being a bird he\u2019s the perfect choice for this task, but as soon as Dera gets to know Tamako and of course her delicious mochi, he quickly gains some weight and is hence unable to fly for too long. As the noble bird that Dera claims to be, he tends to act a little bossy and commanding around everyone even though he is never treated with the respect he would want to be treated with.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many more important characters, each and everyone with a very unique personality, I would even say that the presentation of the characters is one of the strong points of this anime. We got a proper introduction of almost every (important) character, each one of them got their own background story and enough screen time to make their character look appealing to the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\r\nWhen first seeing a clip of this anime online, I was mistaking it for K-On and you have to agree, those two shows look very much alike, probably because they are both produced by Kyoto Animation.\\n\r\nIn my opinion the animation, just like in K-On, was very well done, I kind of like the cute artwork, those big eyes, round faces and adorable expressions. \\n\r\nWhat\u2019s the word they used to describe K-On? I think it was \u201cmoe\u201d, which basically means something like \u201cthe ideal of youthful and innocent femininity\u201d and that\u2019s exactly how Tamako Market presents Tamako and her friends.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Music: 7/10\\n\r\nWhile I think the opening theme \u201cAya Suzak - Dramatic Market Ride\u201d was not that catchy but good nonetheless, the ending theme \u201cAya Suzak - Neguse\u201d left a much bigger impression on me. It doesn\u2019t happen often that I really listen to the ending of an anime, but this one is really catchy. For the background music, I can\u2019t even tell whether this show had any kind of background music at all, other than the songs they played in the little record store. I guess this means the background music wasn\u2019t that impressive but on the other hand I can\u2019t recall any moment in which I was bothered by the music as well.\\n\\n\r\nTotal enjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nTamako Market is far from being a masterpiece, but then again I don\u2019t think it aimed to be one to begin with. It\u2019s a light comedy with an overdose of cuteness put into each and every episode. In addition to that it\u2019s also very simple and all in all a nice anime to watch especially when you are a fan of cute girls doing cute stuff.",

            "content": "Tamako Market could best be described as like watching a 5 hour long advert for mochi. The shallow story never really allowed me to feel a connection with any of the characters, but was sure to tell us that mochi is, in fact, quite delicious, and something about the power of friendship and family. Special attention to Japanese culture is also given, through the introduction of foreigners who, despite having perfect (and never explained) Japanese language ability, are completely oblivious to aspects of life in Japan. \r\nCharacter design is by Yukiko Horiguchi of Lucky Star and K-On! fame -- in fact, the characters look almostidentical to those from K-On!, with the main character Tamako appearing deceptively like K-On's Mio with twin tails. And indeed, this is yet another installment of cute girls doing cute things. However, unlike K-On!, Tamako Market lacks any of the charm of similar shows, and is only memorable for a handful of things: an obnoxious talking bird who apparently is trying to be the second coming of Casanova, a beautiful florist voiced by Daisuke Ono, and -- oh yes, not least of all -- mochi and more mochi. It's mildly amusing, but don't expect too much. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the character voices are bland, with a few exceptions, and the opening theme is utterly forgettable or even slightly annoying. In contrast to the dull sound, however, the artwork is beautiful -- one of the few redeeming aspects of this series. \\n\\n\r\nI can't say I hated Tamako Market. It's pretty, occasionally funny, and depicts idealised life in a small shopping district with a bit of surrealism thrown in. But it felt like a lot of time to spend watching something that never managed to rise above mediocre.",

I\u2019m in the middle of episode 12, but I can\u2019t bring myself to finish it. I don\u2019t care anymore. I don\u2019t care about you, Tamako, or your friends or whatever mundane crap you\u2019re doing. And that\u2019s the problem, isn\u2019t it? There\u2019s nothing to care about.\r\nTamako Market is about a cute girl (Tamako) that works in a mochi shop. She has cute friends, she has a cute sister, and she lives in a quaint neighborhood market. She goes to school, she talks with a guythat has a crush on her, and she has a talking bird.\\n\\n\r\n By the way, the talking bird has more screen time than any of those little dipshits in the show. He\u2019s flamboyant and has some passion. His dialogue is decently interesting. He\u2019s probably the best character because everybody else is bland moeblob. \\n\\n\r\nSlice-of-life is not a bad genre. No genre is unless you\u2019re doing \u201cMagical Girl Sports Military Harem Fighting Furry Adventures.\u201d I\u2019m gonna throw out this original, patented thought and say King of the Hill is one of the best animate slice-of-lives out there. I\u2019ll even put in those Nickelodeon cartoons like Hey Arnold!.\\n\\n\r\nWhy? Because every episode gives you something to care about. It has plot and character development. The most basic definition of SOL is anything episodic without a main story, but it still needs to follow the rules of good writing. Every season of King of the Hill is Hank selling propane (and propane accessories), Peggy being a bitch, and Bobby being a little shit. Hey Arnold! is Arnold solving everybody\u2019s problems whether they want him to or not. In Tamako Market, there are no conflicts for me to care about. Nothing. That's why Tamako Market is so boring, and took me 6 months to get through.\\n\\n\r\nSo does this garbage have any redeeming value? Well, it looks fantastic as do all KyoAni shows. The animation is colorful and bubbly. The characters are cute. It always puts me in the mood for mochi. \\n\\n\r\nBut what went wrong? It\u2019s the sheer lack of anything to care about. The characters are actually decent. It\u2019s just that without any conflict there\u2019s nothing about them to root for. The closest thing that resembled a conflict was one of Tamako\u2019s friends couldn\u2019t come up with a dance routine for school and she spent the episode hiding it. If this plot sounds familiar then a Saturday morning cartoon has probably done it and better.\\n\\n\r\n Cute girls, but nothing to care about. Another painfully boring slice-of-life.",

            "content": "When I heard about Kyoto Animation's latest series Tamako Market, my expectations were probably unusually high. I had just come off of watching, and loving both Hyouka and Clannad, and was expecting another spectacular series in a similar vein to those two. Of course, that's not at all what I got. \r\nBeing directed by Naoko Yamada, written by Reiko Yoshida, and character designs provided by Yukiko Horiguchi (all of who worked in the same positions on K-ON!) this series has quite a lot of similarity with said series. However, I was unaware of this fact before I started the show, so maybe my expectations wereslightly unreasonable. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there's a lot to talk about in Tamako Market, so let's get on to the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10): Tamako Market doesn't really have much of a story. The series is almost a textbook example of a slice-of-life series. The show follows the main character Tamako who is a carefree, bouncy energetic girl who absolutely loves mochi. She has a friend named Mochizuo who, like Tamako, is the child of a mochi making family. She also has a few friends from school who pop into the story, but I'll explain about them in the characters section. In essence, one day a talking bird name Dela Mochimazzi wreaks havoc when he jumps into the shopping market, saying he's looking for a bride for his prince, and the story follows their daily, mostly episodic lives.\\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn't really have much weight, but the individual episodes range from enjoyable to boring. I was really put off by the first episode when the bird came off as more annoying than funny, but I'd say the writers of the show got better at using him as the show went on. The series bills itself as a comedy, and in that regard, its a hit and miss. While the slice of life stories were somewhat enjoyable, I would have preferred an actual story. Which was why I was surprised when in the second half of the show, it did try to give us an actual story. When the series decided to go down this route, I was really excited, hoping for a very interesting finale.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, I got a very lackluster ending with a forced, and very anti-climatic resolution. Sad as it is, the ending almost ruined the show for me, as this was the part of the series I was looking forward to the most. None of the character drama was really resolved, and I felt the ending just could have been done SO much better. Overall though, I found the story fun to watch, and I was really waiting during the second half to see how the ending would play out.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10): Easily the best part of the series. While the character designs are simple enough, and are all too familiar to K-ON!, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The animation is of very high quality, and really helps to sweep the viewer away into this simple, yet relaxing world the vast amount of colorful characters in the shopping district live in. The backgrounds are simple, yet really help to bring out the best in the character design and animation brought to the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10): The music definitely isn't spectacular, but it does fit the show. The opening theme is really catchy, while the ending theme is very forgettable. The BGM fits very well in the series, and the shining moments for the music is truly when they played with the comedic timing. I know, a rather skimpy entry, but that's all there really is to say about the music. Fitting, yet mostly forgettable. The voice acting is really well done though, and I found especially fitting of the characters, especially the bird's voice (which always cracked me up.)  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): If there is one thing Tamako Market is not, its being a character driven series. Most of the characters are given broad character types, and don't show much depth. I was annoyed by this through most of the series, but eventually came to realize that the characters are still very fun in their own right. In addition, they did start to flirt with character depth in the second half of the series, with Tamako having a partial emotional breakdown, Dela actually showing himself as more than just a bossy bird, and even the dad shows some depth. Regardless, none of this is fleshed out, and as someone who absolutely loved the characters in Hyouka and Clannad, this disappointed me.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that doesn't mean the characters aren't a lot of fun. Tamako is bouncy, a bit of an airhead, yet as with the other girls in this show, really cute, and reminds me of Chitanda from Hyouka in a good way. Her friend Midori was an interesting concept, and I was really hoping they'd give some resolution to her possible feelings for Tamako. Dela started out as EXTREMELY annoying, but actually became a really funny character as the show went on. Tamako's friend Kanna gets some laughs to, even if she doesn't have much character, and so does Tamako and Mochizuo's fathers, who are both really funny characters as soon as they first appear. Mochizuo himself is a rather large stereotype with zero depth, but still has his own charm as being the childhood potential love interest.\\n\\n\r\nOne character is a surprise character who doesn't appear until the second half of the show, so I won't spoil it for you, but this character easily became one of my favorites. Overall, I thought this diverse cast of characters may lack much depth, but were still a lot of fun to watch on screen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10): Because of the mass disappointment of the ending, I had to drop this down to a 7. Regardless, I did find a lot to enjoy in the series. The atmosphere is so calm and peaceful, you fall in love with it almost immediately. The characters are a little wacky, but that's partially where they get their charm from. Everything in this series is peaceful, and rather mundane, even when considering the second half of the series, but that doesn't mean I didn't like it. I just would have preferred more deep characters, and a story with more weight.\\n\\n\r\nWhile my favorite part of the series was definitely just staring at the gorgeous artwork, it wasn't just the art itself that ended up giving the series a boost, but it really did bring the characters and the setting to life. All of the designs are simplistic, yet gorgeous, and its almost exactly how you'd envision such a setting in your imagination. However, with all its bells and whistles, the series' ending was still disappointing, and I definitely would have liked more character development and an actual story.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy, meanwhile, like I said earlier, is hit and miss. Some of the jokes were really funny, while others were irritating and a bit annoying. However, I did feel the comedy helped bring out the characters, and the jokes were funny enough to give the series a breath of fresh air in order to get me through some really boring episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7.5/10): If you could give .5s on this website, that's definitely what I'd give this series. While the ending was very disappointing, the characters didn't have much depth, and the art was a bit simplistic, the characters were still hilarious, and very fun to watch, the artwork and animation was gorgeous, and the comedy aspect of the series was really funny when it hit a stride.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I definitely wouldn't recommend this series to those who only enjoy a series if it has a deep story, riveting characters and or lots of action, for those who are willing to get swept away in this calm, peaceful, sometimes hilarious story with its simple setting, and quirky, funny characters, this series is probably worth a watch, even if its just to relax from watching said heavy action,plot, character development series.\\n",

Yes it got a lot of cute characters and ridiculous day to day situations and it's mainly a topnotch comedy with lot's of funny moments (That damn fat bird was just too much)\r\nOn the other hand it got subtle hints whither it's words, glances or simple gestures that actually make you think about more than just that. (It doesn't smack you in the face with it) at least that's what it did to me\r\nStill thecomedy it self was really great and really enjoyable and makes the show well worth the time.\\n\r\nThe movie got less of the ridiculousness and focuses more on the romance aspect (well it's called \"Love Story\" duh)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10):\\n\r\nThe show offers a lovable and down to earth collection of characters (except for the that fat arrogant bird :D). It was a blast to watch how characters interacted with each other\\n\r\nIt was somehow low on character development but it did offer some (this is also something you will get through subtle hints and gestures)\\n\r\nThe movie will offer a little bit more character development but only to what serves the ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (10/10):\\n\r\nThis is a Kyoto Animation anime so you will be having a lot of colorful and beautiful environments and top notch designs and the characters will look beautiful and cute (The eyes are as sparkle as ever)\\n\r\nAnimations look sharp and detailed and there is a lot of attention to simple movements and gestures\\n\\n\r\nMusic & VA (8/10):\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were what you would expect of this kind of show but the soundtrack featured some special tracks in some points of the show that helped set the general mode.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was quite good as well\\n\\n\r\nEffectiveness (8/10):\\n\r\nIt was a really enjoyable show and even though the plot was somehow episodic it was still satisfying and it offered some great comedy that (as i said) just by it self will make the show worth the watch supported by it's nice collection of characters. People might think that i am overestimating the show but it really was a beautiful anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.4/10)",

            "content": "Everyone knows what to expect from Tamako Market even before it aired. Kyoto Animation's on a roll and churning out the cute-girls-doing-cute-things anime ever since K-ON became a smashing success and that their mo\u00e9blobs literally oozes money. Plus, Tamako Market is an original; meaning they had free reign to stuff mo\u00e9 into the show in any way and every way possible.\r\nSo is it a cheap strategy that banks on a recycled stereotype? Shockingly, not at all. The gargantuan budget allowed superb production quality and a fair amount of creativity as well; the mo\u00e9blob of the season, Tamako, proved that there still could be something newfor this archetype. She's bubbly, but not clumsy. She's energetic, but not loud. She's mellow, but not air-headed. She's friendly, but not insensitive. She could have carried the whole show by herself.\\n\\n\r\nNot that she has to. There's also the ridiculous obese talking bird of royal heritage, which is half of what made the show so funny. There's also the friendliness and homeliness of the shopping arcade, Tamako's quirky friends, the childhood friend that has a crush on her, and the tsundere dad. I ended most episodes knowing that nothing important has actually happened, but those factors made sure I never had a boring time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while endings has always been a weakness of these plot-less titles, Tamako Market has managed to end things on a surprisingly enjoyable high note. If I had to complain about something, it would be that their pinafore-styled uniform made then look like elementary students. Maybe that's actually the intention?\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, KyoAni delivered. Damn it, man. They're setting the bar too high for me to enjoy the other stuff. Giving something like this a full score makes me look stupid, man, but even if I try, I can't see it deserves any lower.",

            "content": "The winter 2013 anime season brought to us many good anime series, a great starter for the year and as always KyoAni has delivered something that I really enjoyed. Nothing special, just something that helps delivers one\u2019s moods to spring. (I will try not to spoil too much)\r\nTamako market is a simple slice-of-life story about a Tamako Kitashirakawa, a high school girl in a small town, who\u2019s the daughter of a mocchi (Japanese rice cake) maker in a shopping district. The show allows us to have a view of her and people in the community, their personality and lifestyle, with a small twist...  theTalking Bird, Dera Mocchimazui; who enters the community accidentally while searching for a bride for his prince, in a tropical kingdom far away.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole series seems to represent the ideal small town life in Japan, with an extremely close knit community that could be considered one big family and the simple happiness of their seemingly bland, mundane life.  From New Years to summer festivals, it shows us to how they handle their lives and new situations and problems, mainly with the introduction of Dera.\\n\\n\r\nThe series has little plot, but staying true to real slice-of-life, I think that this is befitting of the series. The series is mostly a series of short stories about the things that happen in the community surrounding Tamako\u2019s family and friends, from school to trips to different events that takes places. While there is a underlying plot involving Dera\u2019s original mission, I personally think that this was just used in order to be used to bring the series to a more conclusive ending, though I think that it didn\u2019t make it any more conclusive then it can be.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that made is series for me is the atmosphere that the characters and community produced. They\u2019re personality and mood makes you feel warm and happy as they live on their simple lives in a small neighbourhood. Individually the characters are somewhat stereotypical and not well developed, but as a whole they produced a welcoming and lovely atmosphere for the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters also come with a wide variety, allowing them to have a more vibrant feel. From the various shop owners in the area to Tamako\u2019s friends, to the newcomers in the block, Dera and later his boss, Choi, each of them have their own quirks and personality that helps to build the feel of the story. The main character, Tamako; is a first-year high school girl who is described by Dera as \u201chead with nothing but hair and mocchi\u201d is the sweetheart of the district and is loved by her friends and family. She loves the shopping district and said that she will never leave and her carefree and loving attitudes made her a joy to watch as she felt natural, for me anyway as she lives out her life in the community, having fun and feeding Dera mocchi.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting character in the show is by far Dera, who was added as a supernatural element to the show and also as a comedic mascot. A flamboyant talking bird\u2019s whose name is like a taboo in the Kitashirakawa household as Mocchimazui means \u201cmochi is bad\u201d, despite becoming a stuffed bird due to mochi, so stuffed in fact that he couldn\u2019t continue on with his journey and decided to stay in the area. Dera acted as a sort of catalyst that allows us to explore the lives of the community as he follows Tamako around engages with people in the community. His personality is a bit obnoxious and narcissistic but acts as a comedic joke to lighten the mood.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also Tamako\u2019s family, whose members added little stories to the series, from her father, who was found to have written a song for Tamako\u2019s deceased mother to confess to her while he was young, a song which from the beginning of the series Tamako was trying to find. Then there is her sister, \u201cAn\u201dko; who had her own little section where she dealt with her crush and came to term with her own feelings.\\n\\n\r\nHer friend\u2019s also had a lot of time on screen, from Kanna, daughter of a carpenter who was the series\u2019 joker, always having weird lines in a monotonous voice, to Shiori, a shy girl who as the series progressed made friends with Tamako. Then there is Mocchizou and Midori, the former being Tamako\u2019s childhood friend from across the street who has a deep crush (despite the fact that their fathers are competitors) on her but always fell short of confessing, even so that he took advice from Dera\u2026..The latter is one of Tamako\u2019s closest friends who seem to be very protective of her from others, especially Mocchizou, who she considers as somewhat of a rival.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also various members of the shopping district, each of them vibrant and sweet in their own way. They all love district and is often seen as Tamako and Dera often goes shopping and helps around in the area.\\n\\n\r\nThere were also a few melodramatic moments in the series, but these serve as nothing more than a simple representation of those bad moments in your lives, where you have friends and family to support you, even if the problem is not that big and you may have made it too hard on yourself.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of the series also helped to contribute to the wonderful atmosphere; it made the whole show more lively and natural to me, especially the OP and for some reason the whole thing made me feel like the show was set in the 70s or 80s.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series is a simple and sweet show, and if you want a conclusive storyline then I don\u2019t think that this is for you as it\u2019s just supposed to be a view into the somewhat normal life of a certain group of people and that's what I love about it, being simple and being yourself. As Dera described the town: \u201cEven in days that seem to chill you to the bone, but despite that, you always feel warm right here\u201d. I would describe this series as sitting in the cool spring wind with a cup of tea and eating sweets(maybe mocchi, but I\u2019m not Japanese), nothing extraordinary, nothing great, but just simple warm joy that satisfies your soul.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for listening to my rants, I don\u2019t like to give number scores but if I had to, u can see it above ,No?\\n\r\nBtw, can somebody pls explain to me wat moe is, till today I can\u2019t understand it???\\n",

            "content": "Enter the life of a young girl who lives and breathes life as a devout mochi-maker: what does it look like? Tamako Market gives us a pretty accurate answer, all within a year of foreign visitors coming to \"bride-search\" for a new princess, keeping up friendships at school and boosting the spirits (and sales!) of the local market. Although the story seems quite simple (since it is catered towards a younger audience) and the protagonist is a little towards the shallow edge, I still enjoyed Tamako Market because of the impact of its simplicity and the light-hearted feeling of watching the daily lives of thecharacters play out. It's one of those series that literally lets you step into the local life and see the characters for who they are whilst maintaining the positive vibe of the overall anime.\\n\\n\r\nWe enter the world of Tamako Market when a royal bird named Dera, who is looking for a bride for his foreign prince, gets stuck in Tamako's house by mistakenly believing that Tamako was in love with him (actually he just wants to stay for the mochi haha). The ensuing story is fairly simple in that it explores different situations involving Tamako, her friends and her family (and the rest of the local market) within the backdrop of Dera \"trying\" (he really doesn't try at all, it's just an excuse to stay) to find a bride for his prince. In terms of storyline, it is a pretty standard slice-of-life style anime with episodes about making friends, falling in love, hosting a haunted house and dancing at a cultural festival. But these episodes are still unique in the way they explore the characters, it's a lot more about the characters than the content of the episode.     \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, the story revolves around Tamako, who is a charismatic, but slightly dense, young girl who absolutely loves mochi. Surprisingly Tamako's character can become a little exhausting from an overload of positivity coupled with naivety, but since this series is admittedly geared towards younger girls, the slightly over-optimistic personality can be forgiven. What kept me interested was not just Tamako, but the rest of the characters and their individual troubles: how Anko (her sister) has a secret crush on her friend, how Mochizu (her neighbour) is trying so hard to confess to Tamako, how Tamako's father consolidates his feelings about the past and how Tamako's school friends (who are very different from Tamako) fit together as a group. Then there's the overarching interactions with the local community - I found it heartwarming to see the solidarity of the people in the markets and their support for Tamako and her family. All these character issues might sound childish due to their simplicity, but even where the character stories are simple, it actually makes it easier to appreciate the theme underlying the episode.\\n\\n\r\nThis art is very fitting for that \"kawaii\" kind of feel and there's no denying that the opening theme is one of my favourites: the song, Tamako jumping down from the sky and the dancing markets make me so happy!\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap up, Tamako Market is a sweet anime (literally because of the mochi overload), and I would recommend watching it if you're looking for something simple, but still meaningful and enjoyable.",

            "content": "The \"Cute girls, doing cute things\" has become somewhat of a staple towards the slice of life genre and shows offering such themes have quite evidently been flooding the medium ever since it became a thing. While looking at it from a more basic perspective, Tamako Market, too, belongs under the same theme but quite thankfully offers more to look towards that allow it to stand out from the rest. Though, even considering what it does offer, the real question arises.. Is it enough ?\r\n===Story===\r\nThe story starts out basic enough and is quite easy to digest which works as a plus point for most situations.Now what stems from this is that the show remains easy to pickup, there's no intertwining plot or any such material which would considerably need one to wrap his/her head around. Not to mention that most of the start is pretty episodic thus strengthening the fact that it's easy to pick up at any given time. While it all sounds dandy, this also serves as a disadvantage as there's not really any major plot to consider, which might turn off some viewers. Though there are some story elements which eventually develop into something bigger, it still isn't exactly anything worthy of consideration as it ends up feeling like just another small scenario within a larger collection.\\n\\n\r\n===Art and Animation===\\n\r\nTamako Market delivers fairly well in this regard. The art style is very good, with a bright but soothing color pallet that fits with the theme very nicely. There's also some good attention to detail at points such as characters even showing stray hairs, just to name one such example. Movements are also very well animated which makes the characters look more expressive and puts more life into them. Thankfully, Kyoto Animation does always manage to deliver when it comes to visuals, and Tamako Market was no exception.\\n\\n\r\n===Sound===\\n\r\nTaking into account, the soundtrack first, its a very fitting collection of different tunes. The soundtrack does well to compliment the nature of the show and fits well into the different scenarios that are presented to us. It's nothing I would call exceptional but is indeed a good match for the Anime in question.\\n\r\nNow, if were to look towards the voice acting, I'd say a very good job was done indeed. The characters would not have felt as lively as they did without the efforts of the voice actors, especially towards the main character, I could not help but feel that half of the reason for her cute and innocent flare was due to the voice acting. While I won't say that it was 'Realistic', It was indeed very charming.\\n\\n\r\n===Characters===\\n\r\nThe characters introduced to us in the show are thankfully not the common stereotypes you'd see in most shows, but they're not anything I'd call 'Unique' either. They are however, charming and cute in a more natural way than shown in most other shows within the same genre. While they did come out as charming and did well to provide an enjoyable experience, they were very much lacking in development. For almost the entirety of the show, we almost never really see any of the characters grow in any way, and while there were hints of some deeper backgrounds to some characters, they were never given enough time or the chance to be explored further.\\n\\n\r\n===Presentation===\\n\r\nEven with its issues, the show does indeed provide an enjoyable experience. It has a nice atmosphere to it and does soothe you with its fun scenarios during times when you really don't feel like doing much. The execution and presentation of these scenarios is done well and did manage to get a chuckle or a smile out of me a few times. And even though the plot might seem linear, there are some moments which were somewhat heartwarming and sent out a feel of familiarity during cases some viewers might empathize with. The only bad point I would point out in this aspect is that most scenarios felt discarded due to the show's episodic nature and there were some story elements which needed more explanation but were never given that. Leaving viewers feeling somewhat void by the end.\\n\\n\r\n===Conclusion and Verdict===\\n\r\nI will go by saying that this show isn't for everyone. It either requires people with certain tastes or a good amount of boredom to truly like this show. Even with that said, I would not call it a bad one as it does work as a good show to watch for a change of pace or during times you need something lighthearted and easy to pickup. Because of this, Tamako Market has managed to find a place for itself within the community despite being a pretty mediocre title altogether.",

            "content": "Welcome to the moe train everybody! Let me be your guide on this ride! Prepare for the cute girls doing cute things, this time with a bird and a black girl!\r\nWas that too much?\r\nYou might like this anime if:\r\n-You like anything moe\r\n-You are looking for a show to watch in one sitting\r\n-You like funny shows\r\n-You want to watch something relaxing\r\nYou might dislike this anime if:\r\n-You hate everything moe\r\n-You are looking for anything special. You will not find it here\r\n-You are looking for a show with a complex story. This is not here either\r\nStory: 7\r\nNothing special here. It's as simple as a story can get, witha few cool aspects here and there. It does enough to provide an overall story, so that the show can end on a somewhat satisfying note, but it still could have done more, as the setup was actually quite unique for this type of shows. What I got to give this show, is that the movie, that serves as a sequel to this anime, has a nice story, and this served as a great setup for it. Not everything was explained in there, but in the end you don't watch moe shows for story anyway, do you? The comedy is pretty good, I bursted out laughing more than enough times to state that.\\n\r\nAlso, yes, it is cute.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 9\\n\r\nWhile you could say that it's just another typical looking moe show, I would disagree. It looks much cleaner than most shows and most importantly it's color pallet is incredible. This show uses a wide variety of colors, and knows what to do with them. You will see the very bright and cheerful shopping district become dark and gloomy at night, or some great character design here and there. To put it in words, the cuteness is dripping from every possible angle. The animation is extremely fluid too. I could not spot a single graphical mistake, during the entire show. Honestly this show's artstyle and animation is some top notch stuff!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI know that you may be sick of this word already, but yes, it's cute. Nothing too special, but it has some good tracks and it fits nicely. You should not expect K-On's OST level of greatness, but it does it's job and a little bit more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThe show has some pretty good characters, with actual backstory and development. Not all of them, unfortunately, but it has some at least. Tamako is a really good MC, she has some decent development and an interesting backstory for her love of mochi. Tamako's family, the son of a rival mochi shop owner Mochizou and Tamako's friends get some pretty good development as well! Except for the one girl, who just likes to measure and build stuff. The other residents of the shopping district also get little love, which is a shame, because they seemed to have something interesting in them. But let's not forget Dera, who is a talking bird. Yes, a talking bird. He serves as the comedic relief, and a reason for the show to have an overall story. He is absolutely hilarious and can sometimes carry the anime to some new comedic heights! Some lows too, but that's rare. Overall this show has a great cast of characters, at least better than I ever expected.\\n\r\nAnd yes, the characters were amazingly cute.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI honestly didn't expect to like this show so much, but with it having an actual story, a great set of characters and a fantastic movie sequel, I just can't help but to love it. Watching this show as like a brain therapy. The ammount of cuteness is immeasurable. I could not ask of anything more of this show, it was already quite a surprise. While it could deliver more, it was definitely a fun ride!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThis show will not blow your mind, it will just gently pat you on the head the whole way through. I would even say, that it's worth the watch just so you can watch the movie. I had a lot of fun watching this, and so should you!\\n\r\nPlease remember, that this is purely my opinion, and I reccomend you to develop your own.",

            "content": "Tamako market was a pretty average slice of life series and not really an interesting one, I'll give credit that it's one of the few modern anime shows that isn't filled with tons of ecchi and can be watched by every age group with its' lighthearted quirks, but overall it was an underwhelming anime where the supporting characters don't have much screen-time and development and the ending was pretty weak. The talking bird was also rather annoying.\r\n         The only reason I watched this anime is because it's awesomeanimation and cute character designs. This anime reminds me of Hyouka (the main character's personalities and appearance are very similar).The character design is the same as Hyouka because it's being made by Kyoto Animation but I don't mind that at all.\\n\\n\r\n         The music throughout the episodes are mostly really simple songs, that fit the situation. Except for in the coffeeshop, where the guy plays records and these always seem to help out the situation.The sounds and music are befitting for Tamako market\\n\\n\r\n       Overall Tamako Market is a light, easy-to-watch series.i recommen for you to watch it if you like to watch moeblob anime.",

            "content": "So this show reaffirms my theory that Kyoto animation just can't produce two back to back animes that are truly entertaining and doesn't have to rely heavily on there animation and production skills (because seriously what else do they do consistently) to sell anime. *sigh* Welcome to Tamako Market a show about a young girl who loves to make mocchi.... and...\r\nthats it. Depending if you enjoy watching cute girls do cute things, such as girls making a band buy spending 10 out of the 12 episodes eating cake and drinking tea then you will enjoy this anime alot.... you poor, poor soul you.\r\nStory: (3) \r\nFindingan actual story in a show like this is pretty rare these days as anime that has the ever so popular \"moe\" aspect in them, basically kicks Story to the curb, I mean who needs a show with a story right. Tamako is a young girl who loves to make mocchi and meets a talking bird calls dera who is on a mission to find the bride of his prince from his country. Kinda cool concept when you think about it, meeting different girls and trying to find which one is the perfect girl for your friend but thats barely looked into until like the last 2-3 episodes. The episodes prior to the last 2-3 episodes are basically slice of life moments of seeing tamako and her friends work around a market making mocchi and doing all sorts of things ranging from a mocchi making contest and making valentine mocchi. Stuff of pure legend right here.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8) \\n\r\nWhen talking about Kyoto animation and there art its really really hard not to have high expectations due to there previous works always having to rely on their art work to make their money (think im joking just look at Little Busters... oh you don't know little busters well thats my point since they didn't produce that anime which was done by J.C. staff; but you would think that if key visuals anime were sooooo good then it wouldn't matter if the animation was a little off at times.)\\n\r\nTamako Market animation is really nice and fluffy but thats about it they look like they rehashed alot of the character designs from hyouka and K-on to make this anime as well so if you watched those two anime before you will notice that alot of the characters look alike.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8)\\n\r\nAnother field where Kyoto Animation works hard to excel as they basically live off the motto \"if the story don't move them to tears, these soundtracks sure as hell will,\" and it must be said that they do have a plethora of music that wouldn't be recognized by the common audience so i applaud Kyo-ani for that. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is done pretty well and im not gonna lie i really did like Kanna's voice which was done by a relatively new VA so whoop whoop to that.\\n\r\nAlso another person note worthy of being mentioned is Mister Takumi Yamazi AKA Kayneth Archibald El-Melloi (Fate/Zero)  thats right folks the big man actually plays as Dera-chan and he does an epic job at sounding super pretentious all the time. love this guy \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(5)\\n\r\nI put a 5 because really the characters aren't to great i know that this show is a moe slice of life half comedy type thing but after watching hyouka and chuunibyou demo koi ga shitai (which i would recommend more than this show) Its really no excuse to have such bland characters when they had relatively good ones in those two shows named. Tamako is happy go lucky alllllllllll the time and every other character is bascially a different type of \"cute\" with a different name, examples: Kanna (irregular cute), Midori (energetic cute), shiori (shy cute), Anko (rebellious lil sister cute)\\n\r\nReally all the girls in this show are cute in one way or another and i know its supposed to be that way but its hard to define these girls without using the word cute and a word describing there niche such as being shy or energetic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6)\\n\r\nMy enjoyment fluctuated between episodes as some episodes were just flat out boring especially when it focused more on Tamako (i mean really its her show but nearly all the support and side characters are more interesting and fun to watch.) I genuilly hoped that the plot moved faster and that it kinda became a love showdown and become a classic game of who gets the girl but alas Kyo-Ani doesn't seem to want to instill romance in an anime for no more than once a year (guess there saving there romance points for fall season :p)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6) \\n\r\nOkay anime, not going to be remembered for anything for years to come as it will most likely be labeled as another moe anime but your free to try it if your into watching girls sit around making mocchi and eating moochi.",

            "content": "[ALIGN=justify]\r\nAll right\u2026 My second review. I know Tamako Market from short advertisement in other moe-moe-whatever-anime titled Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai. Everyone watch Chuunibyou should see that advertisement in the end of last episodes. I\u2019m certain all of you already know moe-moe anime like this has been showed since several years ago. You know, we can\u2019t underestimate them. I mean, they gain many fans because of these kind of movies. I can see many of my friends in the certain i-net forum have revered the musical anime K-ON. They also praise the heart-touching-anime, Kokoro Connect. Besides other group of them can\u2019t stop laughing after watchedloli-comedy-anime Chuunibyou. So it\u2019s true that these moe kind anime have their own band of fans. Wait, I have watched the last one and I think I\u2019m the one of Chuunibyou\u2019s fans club since it\u2019s a foolish funny anime. It isn\u2019t bad at all. I\u2019m always looking for comedy anime. I\u2019m crazy in comedy.\\n\\n\r\nIn the other hand according to me a story line is one of the most important things in anime. So if these kind of anime just sell about moe-moe things without considering the story, what\u2019s for? Maybe they will say \u201cHey, did you already watch Kokoro Connect? And you\u2019ll have your opinion are totally wrong\u201d. Ok fine, it\u2019s not always like that and I never blame the kind of anime watcher who\u2019s just seeking for moe-moe things. But this Tamako Market isn\u2019t counted. Here some synopsis.\\n\\n\r\nThe story tells about slice of middle schooler\u2019s life named Tamako. I had thought she has an egg store since the meaning of word \u201cTama\u201d should be an egg in english and she holds something round in her hand. In fact I was totally wrong. Tamako is the daughter of mochi shop owner who lives in the certain shopping district. And the ball like thing in her hand which I ever saw must be mochi. She loves mochi so much and she enjoys her daily life as mochi maker. She has younger sister named Anko, gandpa, and father of couse. She is very cheerful person and never complains about a single thing in her life. She goes to school at the morning, attends some club activity in the school, does a lot of fun with her friends, and other general middle schooler activity. Loving mochi doesn\u2019t mean just eating it. She\u2019s also really good in making some mochi. Since she\u2019ll continue the family business of course. Her life\u2019s suddenly changed when she meets\u2026wait\u2026there\u2019s nothing like that because this anime isn\u2019t about shonen battle or supernatural martial arts. Just kidding. But it\u2019s true that there\u2019s something new in her life when she meets with a strange talking male bird named Dera. For real, Dera can speak fluently just like ordinary human. Dera has been lost from his mission to find his master\u2019s bride. It means he\u2019s the stray bird. Tamako sincerely helps him and invites him to stay in her house for long time without hesitate. Dera is the kind of bird who always butts in at other people business and he\u2019s really elegant as well. He\u2019s getting fat because Tamako always feeds him with many of mochis. Actually Dera has absurd ability. He can make some hologram message with his eyes just like projector. Even I\u2019m still wondering what kind of animal Dera is. Better if we don\u2019t discuss it. It\u2019s an anime after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn\u2019t develop so much. I mean there\u2019s nothing serious case as long as the running of this anime. Every episodes were spent with the story of normal daily life. Tamako\u2019s childhood friend named Mochizou loves her so much but in the end he never be able to confess it. Last arc is about the appearance of Dera\u2019s owner called Mochimazzi Mecha. Mecha\u2019s servant, Mochimazzi Choi, revealed that Tamako is the bride who he\u2019s always looking for because Tamako has a mole in her neck. That mole is convinced as the mark of Mechas\u2019s bride. Tamako just stays cool for facing it. She never had a good mind to leave everyone in the order to become Mecha\u2019s wife. Everyone started to worry about Tamako\u2019s decision. They\u2019re afraid Tamako will leave the shopping district. Everything is clear when Mecha said that he has no intention to take Tamako away. Even if Tamako is really her bride. He just wants to met his servant, Choi, and take her back to their home.  And everyone can be relaxed now.\\n\\n\r\nSo, here some of my opinion\\n\r\nPlus :\\n\r\n-\tI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t say it a lot. Because this anime just serves some humors without strong meaning in there. Even I love comedy I could say that it isn\u2019t my cup of tea. It\u2019s like a childish humor.\\n\r\nMinus :\\n\r\n-\tI have said it. There\u2019s no one serious case which can make some story developing here.\\n\r\nSo, I doubt I would give a high score at this anime even I\u2019m easy to give a score. Without underestimating moe-moe-anime series I think 6 is proper score for Tamako Market.\\n\r\n[/ALIGN]",

            "content": "I just finished watching this anime and now.. I dont know what to do with my life.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nas many people say almost nothing happens in tamako market, but i don't really see it as a problem. The story still manages to being interesting and you get involved in the characters' quotidian life, it makes you wish you could live in their world and when episode 12 comes you feel empty and dead inside because you want to watch more. Fortunally there's gonna be a movie. Anyway the best thing in this anime is that it lifts your mood and at the same time it's capableof dealing with deeper emotions, to be honest i shed a tear at the end. The pacing it's great and it's never boring, there are some freaking funny scenes and there's also a bit of romance which it's not treated in a clich\u00e9 way. basically the story it's good but it's not great because it doesnt really have an ending and honestly, it should never end. i wanna watch it forever. the only flaw was the blushing i guess, wayyyy to much\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was the cutest i've ever seen in my whole life. The colors were pretty, the character designs were pretty, the bgs were pretty and it was animated really well, It all fits with the light style of the anime. kyoani did not disappoint this time\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe op/ed were pretty good, really catchy and they captured the soul of the anime. Most of the soundtrack was ok but what was really great were the songs played in the scenes at the bar, those were spectacular and it felt vintage.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nwow this review sucks cause im only praising the anime but it's not my fault tamako market's so good. It's the characters fault. Because this is one of the best casts of the last years. None of they main characters is flat, they all go throught some sort of developement, especially the main girl really surprised me near the end because she truly showed her personality. The best is without a doubt Dera the fat bird which is ridicolously funny. You get attached to everyone and you feel what they're going through. Really wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nObviously. I started watching this after two of the biggest disappointments(chuu2 and kyoukai) so i was expecting it to be shit but it isnt. It really isnt. I laught, i cried, im missing it already. So it's obviously a ten. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nI declare this the most underrated anime of the year GO WATCH IT NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING\\n\r\nIf you don't like moe, this really shouldn't bother you because it has substance.",

Well you see, this overloading of positive emotions in the brain is apparently called 'cute aggression' and yeah, Tamako Market definitely knows what it's all about.\r\nComparing this show to a mochi is honestly not too far off. It's sweet, it's soft, and the lack of what one would call a story means Tamako Market is more like a simple slice-of-life to indulge in when you want to relax. Just like mochi! It's basically an adorable escape to a joyfulshopping district where the story, characters, and bubbly atmosphere take place in.\\n\\n\r\nMochi comparison aside, however, there's one main drawback when it comes to being too simple, and it's called blandness. Certain parts throughout the show, such as the dialogues and comedy, come off quite weakly. Like a very trivial trivia. The characters also didn't change much in terms of development but for this one, I didn't think it was a bad thing at all. In fact, I felt it emphasizes this show's collective fun and lightheartedness! Which pleasantly speaking, is something I greatly adored.\\n\\n\r\nLook here. We have a pretty big cast of characters with each of them having their own jolly personality. There's even a talking bird who looks very much like a mochi with an attitude. Funnily enough, despite all the wisdoms he loves saying out of his beak, he always gets the shorter end of the stick, befitting himself as the main source of comedy gold. Other than that, the rest of the characters are pretty much sweethearts. They energize the atmosphere up like a festival, creating a dynamic with plenty of family and community in it. It adds more substance into a story that would've been too bland without them. And with the small romantic subplot adding one last touch on sweetness and innocence, the cuteness is definitely strong with this one.\\n\\n\r\nTruly the most adorable.\\n\\n\r\nNow I want to present to you Kyoto Animation, the moe-nized version. Because without their artistic love, Tamako Market wouldn't have become the cute and lighthearted show I enjoyed watching. The bright use of colors here sets up a cheerful tone that wonderfully fits the characters. It's a mood lavished by qualities tinged with a family aura. This show also has an animation that is full of youthful energy, giving everyone, even the adults, their own adorable sides. Ok, maybe everyone except for the bird, but he certainly knows how to pose. I can give him merits for being a pretty good entertainer, especially for an avian. Got a comedian voice too.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of voice, the overall voice acting complements the characters in a way that is both fun and friendly. When they well up with positivity, it's infectious. I could easily absorb all the emotions in the air. The soundtracks in particular are very playful and sweet-sounding. They blend nicely with each scene and there are even times when you can feel some profoundness, making certain moments more special in a hearty way. One last pleasant thing from this show is the playful opening and warm ending. Both are tuned with a catchiness that really fits what this show is all about.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in the end, Tamako Market didn't hold back in attacking me with a lot of cuteness. While the simplicity does get bland at times, it's still a show that knows how to please, like a welcoming community. And it has mochi too! Maybe it'll make you want to eat one after every episode.",

            "content": "Tamako Market broadcast in 2013 was a rather unfortunate TV series which had great potentials, initially greeted with high expectations, but didn't win hearts and minds of many people in the end. In fact, it was considered as the KyoAni's worst flop since Munto, and haters of KyoAni were very active in dissing the series, which was actually among the most popular ones in a generally poor season. \r\nUnexpectedly, Director Yamada (K-On! series director) and her team made a truly successful comeback with Tamako Love Story movie in 2014, achieving satisfactory sales and receiving an art award. Seen from hindsight, as a combined franchise, TamakoMarket & Love Story is a very enjoyable watch. Tamako Love Story is a serious masterpiece and the highest reach of Japanimation of the 2010s as much as Shaft's Madoka Rebellion is. Tamako Market can be viewed as an etude or a prelude to the best work that KyoAni ever produced; there are advance hints and references here and there which adds great depth to the movie.     \\n\\n\r\nI admit that Tamako Market was not very straightforward in telling a story and at times the KyoAni staffs were not very good at materializing ideas. The handling of the sub-story of finding the bride for the prince was too rushed with an abrupt ending while time was wasted in a mediocre haunted house episode which was irrelevant and out of place. Partly I blame this on some scriptwriters in certain episodes (particularly the one who screwed up also at writing a script for Red Data Girl of PA Works). It's a pity, as Yoshida Reiko was good as always and Hanada-sensei also showed his craftiness in handling slice-of-life.     \\n\\n\r\nThere were some memorable Episodes in the series, such as Midori (the blond girl) having difficulty with her own complex emotions towards Tamako in Episode 2, and Shiori (the badminton girl with glasses) overcoming her social anxiety disorder and befriending with Tamako in Episode 3. Kanna (the carpenter's daughter) was always the most eccentric but also perceptive throughout the series; she's my favorite supporting character who really shined in the later Tamako Love Story movie. Anko (Tamako's little sister) is one of the cutest girls ever drawn by KyoAni, and her love story in Episode 4 and 9 intertwined with the story of their deceased mother were the most successful in the TV series. Actually, the climax Episode 9 is one of the greatest episodes KyoAni has ever made, a true \"Kami-kai (God's Episode)\" (in Japanese slang), which laid solid foundation to the Love Story movie. In Episode 9 we see glimpse of how much impact the loss of mother must have had on Tamako and her family (although we see no painful scenes), and how much love and tenderness is hidden behind the usually stubborn Mamedai (Tamako's father). Mochizou (Tamako's friend living across the street) here is a guy with a heart of gold and assists Anko's love; he is rewarded in return by Tamako giving him a birthday cake (with Anko's reminder to her about his birthday).\\n\\n\r\nI believe the main shortcoming of the TV series was the lack of straightforward  catharsis. The death of mother, adoration of motherhood, love of the family and caring neighborhood is one of the penetrating themes but it's not shown straightforwardly. Showing the actual tragedy must have been deliberately avoided, but it could have given us a more deeper understanding of the character of Tamako (compare this with Episode 6 of Tari Tari produced by PA Works which did a great job in making the series memorable and heroine's character likable by revealing the heartbreaking story of the mother's death). The viewers were left until Tamako Love Story to fully understand the makings of Tamako's character. With Tamako Love Story, we get to see the bitter side of youth and \"look at life from both sides now\".\\n\\n\r\nAnother shortcoming was the lack of good conclusion to the romance of Mochizou and Tamako and Midori (as well as Choi and the Prince), which left the viewers with the feeling that the series was somehow aborted and left incomplete. Haters hated it, and fans thought it needed to be finished off with a second series or an OVA. Practically no one expected that we'll be given instead a full new movie and that a love story between Mochizou and Tamako; practically no one expected it to become a modern classic ... but that's another story. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Butall it does is talk and everyone in the show treats it like it's completely normal, the show taking an insane matrix dive to dodge any kind of intrigue or suspense.

She lives with her father and sister, she goes to school, she helps out in her community.

If you want slice-of-life moeblob cuteness go (re)watch K-ON or something.  This is a bad show, and while it is not offensive in any way, it succeeds in being boring as hell.",

It follows the life of a mochi-maker\u2019s daughter (Tamako) who is obsessed with mochi (if you don\u2019t know what mochi is, it\u2019s a pastry made from rice flour that has a gelatinous consistency and is often filled with different flavored pastes, red bean being one of the more popular flavors- I feel thatmany western viewers may take \u201crice cake\u201d to mean those crunchy things that people eat when they\u2019re on diets and it\u2019s totally different).\\n\\n\r\nAs with all of the other KyoAni shows I\u2019ve watched recently (Chuunibyou Demo Koi ga Shitai!, Hyouka) there is a romance, but no real\u2026 er, summation, I guess?

            "content": "Tamako Market is a great place. Any viewer can become integrated in the communal life shared by the market's shop owners. The amiable Tamako is everyone's friend, including the viewer's, and her personality is hard to hate. Tamako Market is would be a great slice of life comedy show if the story was not so bad. The story is trash. There is just no other way to say it.\r\nI have already watched Chuunibyou and K-On! and all the artwork staff is essentially the same. The character design is nothing out of the ordinary and helps create a very real setting that makes it easier tobecome engaged in the show. The smooth colors and art look wonderful. An air of cuteness surrounds some characters in the right way. They do not do anything spectacular or totally original with the art, but it still looks really good.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is nothing spectacular. It is not particularly good or bad, but I would say I enjoyed listening to it. The opening theme\u2014not to mention the animation that comes with it\u2014really got me excited for the episode. Tamako's personality is clearly felt through it, and it helps set the tone for the setting. The soundtrack, opening, or ending themes are not anything I would go out of my way to download, but they do their jobs and they are not half bad either.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this show was the characters. Tamako is the best airhead ever and Kanna is the best character with her personality type that I have seen so far. The awkward love triangle between Midori, Mochizou, and Tamako was portrayed very subtly, but beautifully. It is hard to see if you are as dense as Tamako, but if you are paying attention, it is great! The only character I really did not like was Dera. Scrap Dera and the rest is good.\\n\\n\r\nThat brings me to my next point: as I said earlier, the story is trash. It is a very obscure and unrealistic plot and it does not fit well with the setting. I understand what they were trying to show through the plot, but it was just a bad idea. Dera often got annoying and is not nearly as funny as he was obviously intended to be. Choi was a good addition and I wanted her to be there the whole time, but the plot killed her as well. Her role in the story shot down the potential she had; she could have been another one of Tamako's awesome friends, but the plot beat her and dragged her away. The plot was dreadfully unrealistic and there was way too much emphasis put on it in some episodes. It was not so unorganized that it was embarrassingly bad, but it was by no means good. The show was still watchable and that is why I do not rate it lower than 3.\\n\\n\r\nI did still enjoy this show. The characters, humor, and cute, innocent atmosphere really made up for the show's shortcomings. If this show were a standard slice of life comedy, maybe featuring Tamako and her friends' life in the market with some scenes at school, it could have been a 9/10.  It is really hard to not like these characters and the humor was still good. Eliminate the plot and you have a great show in Tamako Market. I would rate it above a 7 if the plot was not so terrible.",

            "content": "Tamako Kitashirikawas is a daughter of a \"Mochi\" maker who gets proposed by a royal bird- and because of that things get turned upside down in her normal life. It looks and seems like K-ON but better than that, i really liked the atmosphere and the original genuine jokes. \r\nStory: The mangaka has chose an ordinary shopping district for her/his getup- it seems pure ordinary but turning the story around with scenic events like Festivals.Culture day,Christmas,New Year and mostly rice cakes: it definitely did qualify to get a good rating. There are love triangles- friendship conflicts and just some things out of the ordinary soyou could see how this specific set of people deals with them. Fantasy elements were thrown into the anime which might surprise the audience at first- but you'll eventually get settled in. When you hear the word \"Market\" alas for me it reminds me of my lunch- but this anime is well suited for having either lunch and dinner. (well i watched it like that hehe) \\n\\n\r\nArt:It's simillar to K-ON- you get that cute eyes and hair- the adorable scarves and uniforms- i loved how the intro's were done. The art work of Choi-(who's supposed to be from another country) was done well since her clothes,bangles and hair was done according to a specific tropical southern style. I loved how the atmosphere was given in the anime through art and it calms you blissfully.\\n\\n\r\nSound:The Openings and Endings were all good- Seiyu's did a great job, loved the soundtracks. Isn't surprised that Ono-san did Kaoru's role- he seems to be everywhere and does everything good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:Honestly animes should have more charas like Kanna- that girl is the funniest sarcastic thing ever- each chara is adorable, you just gotta love them. Tamako herself is a positive girl- which no matter how things change she can keep her attire. We see a range of genuine shopkeepers of Asia- which distributes their products for friends for free out of pure generosity. The feelings of the character's are represented so well- their generosity for another's well being is enormous it can literally bring a smile to your face. Adding character's of various genres and traits made this one very perfect to watch and observe. And you gotta love that enka guy from the cafe shop! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I wouldn't give this an 8 unless i didn't enjoy it! I loved the original jokes and the funny mischievous things that happens in this one, this one of those anime you should watch when you are depressed or tired and it will literally cheers you up guaranteed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: There's nothing major to complain about- since this one fits the genres perfectly. I liked the positive air around this anime- totally took my boredom away. A philosophy is given where as to- you will have to meet new challenges one day and the better way to deal with them is with a strong smile. Oh and that everything changes no matter how you want it to be.",

            "content": "Tamako Market is a heartwarming Slice of Life anime about the life of Tamako, a daughter of a mochi shop and her friends. Yes, it is moe and yes, it is a slice of life. It's not supposed to surprise you with a rich plot. Seriously though, if you don't like the slice of life genre which can come across as 'boring' then don't watch it. Also, a heads up, there's a love interest but no actual romance: for that, you should check out Tamako Love Story after watching this.\r\nOn the other hand, if you don't mind it, then I would suggest giving Tamako Marketa try. It's not exactly unique but I think it's very calming to watch. I love the bond everyone has with the market. The characters are indeed very 'moe' and not very in-depth, but still likeable.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to say other than trying it out if you like some sweet heartwarming anime!\\n\r\n(Btw, the opening and ending are AMAZING)\\n",

            "content": "Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evQh-GDa69M\r\nBelow is a script I used for the video, it is not 100% accurate compared to the video and lacks obvious stuff like the visuals I selected, music, etc.\r\nIf you really prefer reading, you can do this, but I'd say watch the video. \r\nWhen I think about Kyoto Animation, I think about their studios unique feel, production values, their masterpieces like Hyouka, the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, and the wonderfully fun K-on! Now, I\u2019ve not liked Kyoani shows in the past (nichijou, chu2) but let me just say this- Tamako Market is just ehhhhhhhhhhh, the shows sorta alright, it\u2019s not got much going forit. It\u2019s not bad, don\u2019t get me wrong, but it\u2019s not good either. Well, let\u2019s go into the specifics. I\u2019m only going to be talking about the television series here, and there\u2019s going to be spoilers for what little story the show actually has.\\n\\n\r\n-transition\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with something I don\u2019t like- the characters. So the characters are interesting, not because they\u2019re something to write home about but because of how they enhance the market itself. There\u2019s a wide variety of unique characters, each with their own little shops, some get more screentime than others but all of them make the market feel alive. The main character is Tamako, and the people in her daily life are all important as well. Her friends, Kanna, Shiori and Midori, are fairly important recurring characters. They\u2019re all members of the baton club, but that isn\u2019t really important aside from a plot in one episode. Shiori is interesting but ultimately disappointing in that she isn\u2019t a friend at first but then becomes their friends in the span of: one episode. We coulda had a gradual friendship building up over time, but the show uses timeskips so it just sorta happens out of nowhere. It\u2019s really jarring, since they spend an entire episode on it- then wham. If they spent another episode on it, it wouldn\u2019t have been as bad, but as is- it\u2019s just wasted potential.  Alongside the main cast is Mochizou, who's in love with Tamako. According to the back of the blu ray box, midori is as well, which makes a couple of interesting interactions, but nothing truly satisfying. No forbidden love triangle, nothing, she just acts defensive against mochizous tamako advances. Kannas basically just autistic and that's about it, seriously. I mentioned the rest of the town earlier, but they\u2019re really not important enough to be true main characters, they only serve to enhance the market, and they do their job well- since the market does feel alive. The final characters are probably pretty divisive, Dera, the mascot character, grew on me as the show went on. He was pretty funny and the interactions with the cast were enjoyable. There\u2019s also choi, and the prince. Choi gets a lot more screentime than the prince, and like dera, she grew on me. I can\u2019t say the same for the prince, he gets so little screentime hes just whatever. The characters overall are just ehhh, I can\u2019t say the main girls are good, they\u2019re generic, hardly develop at all, and due to the large cast of the market, have a hard time getting a lot of showtime. The characters are about a 4, I think they have potential, and the market setting could have made for some great interactions, but the characters overall are just disappointing.\\n\\n\r\n-transition\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nCharacters are the main plot of the show as well. Wikipedia describes the show as \u201cfollowing the everyday life of Tamako, her friends, family and neighbors, and this peculiar bird..\u201d\\n\r\nNone of the stories we get about the characters are particularly good though, the entire show is basically one off episodes about an individual character, but none are particularly outstanding. Let\u2019s just go through every episode quickly, since that's easiest. episode one starts out the series, introducing everyone, (and it\u2019s worth noting the show starts and ends on Tamako's birthday). Episode two sets up a one sided romance with midori, and nothing comes out of it. Episode 3 is about shiori, and her becoming friends with the group. As I said before the show uses timeskips, so its a sort of jarring transition from this episode to the next. Episode 4 could basically be cut from the show, it\u2019s about Tamako\u2019s little sister and it's basically pointless. Episode 5 continues the whole midori thing, but nothing comes out of it, but is more about mochizou and tamako. Episode 6 is about a haunted house, it\u2019s a bit of insight on some of the market people, it\u2019s a little funny, but it ultimately isn\u2019t anything great. In episode 7 and 8 we continue on with the main plot? The bird, dera, has his owner choi come around. This advances the main plot, which I guess this show has, maybe? There\u2019s a pretty funny gag running about dera losing his weight, and the main plot is thrown by the wayside again. The girls all bond with choi, which is cute, but nothing aside from them giving her a sweater and dera\u2019s weight thing happens. We\u2019re onto the last bit of the show, episode nine continues that same pointless \u2018tamako sister romance\u2019 plot, what's more interesting is the song plotline that is introduced. Tamako\u2019s been looking for a certain song her mother used to sing, and it\u2019s revealed in this episode that it\u2019s a song Tamako\u2019s father wrote for his wife.\\n\r\nSo I mentioned earlier that the Baton Club is only relevant in like one episode, and here it is. The most disappointing culture festival episode ever. I actually like the focus on midori in this episode, and the focus on friendship, but seriously man is this culture festival disappointing. Just go watch Hyouka's, that one is fantastic. At the end dera exclaims tamako could be the prince's bride and we enter the last big hoorah of the show. The final two episodes are about tamako being a bride and the prince, who comes to the market. This was really disappointing, it was being built up the entire show, first by dera and later by choi. Some members of the market get some screentime, but seriously is the thing they\u2019ve been hyping up disappointing. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to know Tamako's answer, so the whole thing just feels pointless. Ultimately, dera stays in the market and the movie gets set up.\\n\r\nI didn\u2019t want to spend forever on this part of the review, so I might not have gone into perfect detail on some episodes, but I really wanted to showcase how this show is set up. They make episodes focused on certain characters, and end the show on the conflict and resolution we all predicted a mile away. It\u2019s really poor overall.\\n\\n\r\nNow, look I\u2019m not expecting some masterful story out of this show. I love keion, and other slice of life shows. The problem I had with Tamako was, by the end, I didn\u2019t feel like I knew the characters. At the end of K-on I felt like I knew the cast, and even years after finishing the show I can recall a lot about the characters. I fairly recently re-watched So Ra No Wo To, and after a few months the characters are still fresh on my mind, and still find myself enjoying discussion on the show, these are slice of life shows that have successful stories. Even shows I\u2019m not too fond of, like Lucky Star (don\u2019t kill me, sorry), I felt like I knew the characters by the end. It\u2019s been like a week since I finished Tamako and I can\u2019t really feel anything about them. Even with the show dedicating entire episodes to characters, they just aren't memorable at all.  I\u2019m going to have to give the story a poor score, also a 4.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVISUALS\\n\r\nSomething easy to grade, and something I\u2019m fond of are the visuals. It\u2019s Kyoto Animation, the show looks excellent. I love the colors of this show, the pastels are very pleasing to look at. Some other stuff I was fond of were the school uniforms, which were really unique and cute. The market itself, the primary setting of the show is very well done, Kyoani does an amazing job making it seem like a real, breathing place. Even Tamako and her sisters room feels very unique, they\u2019ve got like drawings and stuff on the walls, and really are interesting. The show is visually excellent, as are all Kyoto Animation shows. \\n\r\nI\u2019m going to give the visuals a 9, while not Hyouka level, they are very amazing.\\n\\n\r\n-transition\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC\\n\r\nAnother thing I\u2019m sorta fond of in this show is the music, the opening and ending are great, I really love both. A lot of the background music does a good job enhancing the scene, but doesn\u2019t go above and beyond. I\u2019m really picky with background music, and I didn\u2019t feel really compelled to listen to anything after finishing the show aside from a track or two. I have to give the music a 6, it\u2019s slightly above average, but not really spectacular. The opening and ending are the only things to take out of the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\n-transition\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nIn terms of overall enjoyment, it was alright. I was really bored some episodes, but found some entertaining, it was a pretty even split. There\u2019s some good comedy, like I said- Dera grew to be very enjoyable and hilarious, but I don\u2019t ever feel like I\u2019ll come back to this show, there are simply others in the same genre I find much more interesting and enjoyable. Enjoyment gets a 5, not bad, but not good.\\n\\n\r\n-transition to ed\\n\\n\r\nCLOSING THOUGHTS\\n\\n\r\nI went into Tamako Market a little optimistic, I\u2019d consider myself a Kyoani fan (four of my favorite shows are from them), and while I haven\u2019t enjoyed all of their stuff, Tamako seemed like it would be in a similar vein to the others. However I was really disappointed. Overall, Tamako has excellent visuals and an alright soundtrack, but the story and characters really drag down the show. I enjoyed some parts, but not all. Sometimes the comedy was there, but there were equally as many unfunny bits. Putting all of these scores together, I have to give it a 5. Now I don\u2019t mean an IGN 5, I mean a 5. Halfway there. Not good, not bad. \\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a diehard slice of life fan, give it a watch, and if you\u2019re a fan of Kyoto Animations other slice of life shows, give it a shot but for the average joe, I\u2019d say don\u2019t bother.\\n\\n",

            "content": "***This is a spoiler free review***\r\nIn our world today, most people turn to anime for over the top action or thought provoking thrillers (Dragon Ball Z, Death Note, Naruto, ext.) but there is something that anime has brought that most people glaze over. Aria was one of the first anime I experienced as a child and while it contained a very slow paced plot (since it was a slice of life), it literally made my day watching it. It contained characters and music that were so in synch it made it such a unique watch. Years later we have Tamako Market which in a lotof ways mirrors what I loved about Aria.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn a slice of life anime, it is hard to get a large amount of appeal unless they rely on moe type stuff to get a large viewer base. While Tamako Market does have some moe elements, it is the very spot on pacing and character development in which Tamako Market in my honest opinion becomes a spiritual successor to Aria. Both shows follow a small cast of characters on their daily routines while also taking place in a seemingly conflict free world in which they are free to do whatever they fancy. Both shows also bring out the question, \u201cWhat do I want to do in life?\u201d Both Aria and Tamako realize by the end of the show what and where is their true calling. Since all the show does is follow the main characters, you might think it would get boring real fast. Well you are wrong on that front because the character interactions are all funny and/or engaging. The character Dela who is a bird who talks usually steals the spotlight in the scenes he takes place in since he is usually both the starter and resolver of conflicts due to his all mighty personality. The anime does rely on some gag type comedy but nothing is overused beyond their usage. One recurring gag is when someone sneezes on Dela, he takes it as an act of courting since it is such an action in his home country. The plot does start out a little slow in the beginning but the show steadily brings in new elements to add towards the final episode. While it isn\u2019t the most thought provoking plot, you will still hopefully enjoy the interactions between the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a little lacking but by no means horrible. The colors are on the plain side but in terms of the actual animation the show does a really good job of keeping a smooth frame rate especially on the scenes where there are objects in motion. Character models are nice throughout the entire season; nothing really else to add.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.7/10\\n\\n\r\nSo I happen to be very much into acoustic qualities and how it affects film. A lot of people do not understand how an amazing score/soundtrack can really make something shine. Visuals are important but it is the sound that makes your chest shake during an explosion or the emotions you feel when a character is crying and the voice actor is doing a great job expressing the in-film character\u2019s emotions. In the case of Tamako Market it happens to be all of these things but the music takes the main prize. The music used in this show is light, cheerful, and used perfectly in all the scenes. The opening song is also amazing as it is catchy and has great instrumentation. The soundtrack is so good that I plan on buying the OST when it comes out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSlice of life shows HAVE to have a good cast or it goes to sh!%. Unless you have a show like Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei that has a character for literally every possible situation, your limited size cast has to provide scenes that are pleasing to the audience. In my honestly opinion, I think that the characters of Tamako Market did an astounding job providing thirteen funny and enjoying episodes of goodness. All four high school students (plus the bird Dela) do an excellent job interacting with each other in both mundane and unique ways. The scenes where Mochizou and Tamako talk to each other from their rooms using the two cups connected by a string reminds me of my youth when that seemed like the cool thing to do. The interactions between Mochizou and Midori were interesting to watch since Midori is overprotective of Tamako and Mochizou is so fu#$ing clueless about girls. The star Dela really brought the show together with his personality and lack of knowledge. I don\u2019t want to sound fanboyish but I am having a hard time trying to find anything wrong with the cast. I am pretty sure that anyone who watches this show will enjoy the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.2/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is not going to appeal to everyone. Many people including myself are getting fed up with the anime industry\u2019s push for more and more slice of life anime with a heavy emphasis on moe. It seems as if studios are becoming more reserved on making a new amazing action adventure or thriller type anime. When Fate/Zero came out it was a breath of fresh air because it was awesome, fresh, new. I want more anime that takes risks BUT in the mists of all the moe crap going on currently, something arose from the garbage and gave me something to look forward to each week. Tamako Market is the rainy day anime of the 2000\u2019s. With an amazing soundtrack and cast, I honestly cannot think of any reasons why someone might not like this show. Don\u2019t go into it thinking it is going to wow you with emotions and actions; just sit back, relax, and watch some youngsters live out their life. You might even laugh along the way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.4/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "Now, I\u2019d be lying if I said this wasn\u2019t one of KyoAni\u2019s more creative works- since this one doesn\u2019t mainly focus on high schoolers in a club. If anything Tamako Market defines the slice of genre, by hardly having any actual story and being about the everyday life of a cheerful high school girl and her obsession for mochi.\r\nMy issues with Tamako Market\u2019s story would lie in the fact, that there isn\u2019t anything there for you to keep coming back for more. After the introduction of the bird, which was an entertaining first episode- the show keeps on going downhill- unable to find better waysto keep you engaged.  The show starts of decent and fun enough, being a nice slice of life that you kick back and catch watch after a stressful day. However, by episode 5 is when I feel the show really starts going downhill.\\n\\n\r\nIt kind of reminds me how like in Air, they tried doing something completely different half way through which just miserably failed. Same can be said about Tamako Market- with the introduction of a new character named Choi who sent Dera to Tamako\u2019s area. From the beginning of the series, this arc happening was constantly being hinted and given some sort of importance that will in turn affect our main character and those around her.\\n\\n\r\nIt even felt like it was going in that direction- but the execution of it was terribly handled- by the end of which it this arc happening felt completely pointless. It didn\u2019t give the story that flare it needed- nor did provide any much needed character development for Tamako or those around her. I just felt completely pointless and when I finished the anime I was frustrated. If anything that arc established was Tamako loves her market- that too in a very messy way. Tamako Market also could have explored several side stories regarding the shop owners close to Tamako and instead focused on developing a stupid arc that felt pointless. \\n\\n\r\nTamako\u2019s best friend Mochizou who is obviously in love with her- hardly gets the importance he deserves. Yes, he gets one episode dedicated to him about that- but again that hardly changes or progresses anything. The show just didn\u2019t explore or develop the relationship with the two- which was a damn shame and complete waste. The fact, they waited till the movie- is just sad. Yes, we didn\u2019t necessarily need any confessions- but it would have been still better than to have Mochizou being madly in love with her and Tamako being completely dense about it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters of the series, they were pretty likeable with some being a hit and a miss. The show does a great job of fleshing out some of the characters. The give attention to characters like Shiori who wants to be friends with Tamako but is unable to speak her mind or Tamako\u2019s little sister Anko who is that little adorable kid who thinks all mature and grown-up and has to deal with her very first crush. But, also Tamako\u2019s father who may seem strict on the outside but is a sweetheart on the inside.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters, however didn\u2019t give much screen time or attention. The bird Dera was a pretty funny comic relief character and he added a lot to the show- but his Choi just felt unnecessary to the story and thanks to her involvement caused the anime to give us several bland episodes and also a very lame conclusion to the story. Tamako Market instead of introducing new characters- so would have just stuck by fleshing out the already huge cast. The supporting cast of the eccentric shop owners were all interesting- so it was sad they were reduced to nothing much more than side characters for Tamako to regularly interact with. Tamako\u2019s friends too don\u2019t get fleshed out well to, with Midori\u2019s intentions and feelings not being properly explained or explored. Also, people\u2019s acceptance of a talking bird just seemed unnatural. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing about Tamako Market that annoys it is its overuse of the word mocha. Like seriously, you can make a drinking game out of the number of times someone says mocha- 90% of the time it would be Tamako. If I had a dollar for every time someone said mocha I would be as rich as Bill Gates. I have never even tried mochi, but by the end of this show I was completely sick of it. That however is my own personal issue, I wonder if any of you felt the same or not. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is forgetful but the ED is catchy and adorable- honestly I looked more forward to that than any episode of the show. The animation is really nice- but the character designs aren\u2019t anything original and the type you\u2019d normally come to expect from KyoAni the latter of which isn\u2019t a bad thing. Majority of Tamako Market\u2019s character look way too similar to others. Tamako, Anko, Shiori bearing similar appearances with Mio Akiyama. Mochizou looking like Yukito and a bit of Makoto- and Kanna looking a bit like Yui. But, overall the animation is really clean and polished- despite it not being some of KyoAni\u2019s better looking works.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, Tamako Market started of being a decent slice of life anime- that went downhill because it tried having some sort of a plot that felt pointless because there was no conflict and everything got solved quickly. It didn\u2019t affect any of the characters and our leading lady Tamako remains completely unchanged from start to finish.  There were some enjoyable moments in the show, but the comedy was just lackluster for the most part and some episodes were totally skippable as they barely help the story move along and were just down right boring.\\n\\n\r\nI am going to give Tamako Market a 4 and that you should probably SKIP IT! I don\u2019t hate this show because it didn\u2019t piss me of or offend me- but I would be lying if I said I enjoyed it. It is in my opinion one of KyoAni\u2019s disappointing shows- especially with a tonne of waste potential. If Tamako Market just explored all the characters, and focused on developing some of the relationships between the characters than I would have highly recommended it. But, since the story blows and the characters don\u2019t have much to offer- I must say it\u2019s better to watch something else that would be worth your time. Tamako Market felt like a waste of time to me- which was really sad.\\n",

It is fun and at times really cute, the characters are very sweet. It is impossible not to take a liking to. The drawings and the soundtrack are valuable and the story truthfully really something nostalgic and romantic. To try to help the growth of the district, it makes me imagine how good it feels to help each other in a globalized world as well and dictated only by market logic. Indeed I have just this feeling of longing for the duration of the series. AnywayI think the two genres, slice of life and comedy, are perfectly represented in Tamako Market. The episodes fly away and did not regret a single second you spend to see it. Truly a beautiful series.",

            "content": "It's doesn't matter how the sound is, or the quality is in an anime. What matters is how the anime impacted on the viewers. How it leaves an impression for its viewers. And how it leaves the mind lingering in a positive way.\r\nNow this anime is what I would call, simple and different. But to summarize altogether on what this show would be, is that it's ordinary. \r\nNo spoilers as always from yours truly. \r\nOverall:\r\nHonest to say guys, I like it. It's one of my favorites. But that's just me. The story goes by somewhat fast when your laughing. I do like the fact thatit's ordinary. Sure there might be some romance then and their, but it's pretty much what it is. A Slice-of-life. Though most viewers might focus more on romance. I'd suggest giving Tamako Market a chance for it's ordinary-ness. Because it's pretty funny. I also heard that there will be a second season. So there might be more to it then what it already is.\\n\\n\r\nSummary(shorter):\\n\r\nTamako Kitashirakawa, the eldest daughter of a family who runs a mochi shop in the Usagiyama Shopping District. One day Tamako encounters a talking bird named Dera Mochimazzwi(Which sounds similar to mochi mazui(bad tasting mochi))who comes from a distant land looking for a bride for his prince. His plan soons to backfire as he gets fatter as time goes by. Tamako market follows the everyday life of her friends, family and neighbors, and the bird, Dera.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMain Characters(In-depth)\\n\r\nTamako Kitashirakawa, the protagonist in the series. She's a first year high school whose in the baton club with her friends Kanna and Midori. She helps her family run the shop everyday and invents new kinds of mochi. Her birthday is usually forgotten because it's on New Year's Eve, which is the busiest time of the year. She's very slow on catching up on things, particularly it regards with peoples feelings. She feeds Dera on regular basis, which makes him bloated and harder for him to fly properly.\\n\\n\r\nDera Mochimazzwi, a noble attendant for the royal court, and a freeloader at Tamako's Mochi shop. During his journey to find a bride for his prince, he got fat in the process and has to postpone his journey. He can only manage to fly short distances before he runs out of breath. He is though rather knowledgeable in love and sometimes gives advice to Mochizo and Midori. He's always full of himself and that leads him to misunderstandings. Anyone that sneezes in his direction would be considered a confession of love towards him. His body also contains a communication system.\\n\\n\r\nMidori Tokiwa, Tamako's classmate and childhood friend, and the captain of the baton club. Her grandparents own a toy shop in the same district as Tamako's. She is always worried on what people thinks of her, and what is expected of her. Which leads her to frustration.  She later comes to terms that she has a feeling for \"someone\"\\n\\n\r\nKanna Makino, same year as her friends, also a member of there club. She is a daughter of a carpenter who works in the same district as Tamako. She's a very relaxed laid back girl, and does not care what anyone else thinks. But she has a fear of heights, and is apparently allergic to birds. Kanna is usually portrayed as an eccentric girl, and always has a straight and emotionless face. Despite being a good friend.\\n\\n\r\nMochizo Oji, Tamako's childhood friend whose family also runs a Mochi shop, which is right across from Tamako's Mochi shop. He's been in love with her for a few years, and gets nervous when he speaks in public. He always ask what Tamako is doing through her little sister, Anko Kitashirakawa\\n\\n\r\nOpinion:\\n\r\nHonest to say the characters is pretty much bland and stays the same. Pretty much as I typed earlier \"Ordinary\". A very dense heroine instead of a hero. Like any Slice-of-life out there. Nothing really stands out but the fact that she's just plainly clueless. Even though there are some character developments. It doesn't show a big outcome. Though that's just herself, her friends doesn't even have much of character development later. All they do is provide friendship in her life. As for Tamako's childhood friend, Mochizou. He does show some promises, but still shows some weak progression like every other character. But I would like to point out that the series doesn't focus on romance, so don't expect too much. \\n\\n\r\nDera I would say is very funny. But maybe that's just me. He could either make you mad, or make you laugh. But he has way more screen time than any other characters in the story, which is the downside. It could've been used to give other characters more progression. What I did like about him though is that he gives more personality to the show than any other character. He's probably the only character that's not bland. Dera will definitely leave you a good impression in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnko doesn't seem to receive much either. She pops out then and there, but is usually not there with everyone else. She does get a little bit of an innocent romance in the series, which is pretty cute. Her character development is well done though, not as bland as the others. It's just sucks that she doesn't get as much screen time as the rest.\\n\\n",

All of the characters besides the main were good (except for the flower shop owner who had a terrible dubbing by a man).  The dub for the bird was hilarious and gave a lot of personality and humor to the bird.  It opens with the terrible voice-acting ofthe flower owner (who does a lot of dubs as a man, and clearly is a man, and is a bad choice.), which leads one to assume it will be awful, but the first word from the bird is great and continues as such.  Disclaimer:  I watch sub and dub equally.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was great, as it was entertaining, and not just run of the mill.  the ending left me at a good closing point, without having to embrace an awful cliched finish.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is a fun one that will most likely keep your attention rather well, and is just a good time with a few serious moments.

            "content": "I'll confess: I bought the hype. \"New series, directed by Naoko Yamada, about a girl who loves mochi!\" What I'd forgotten was that Yamada had a good foundation in Kakifly's K-On manga, and this is an original work, which can be hit-or-miss, even for Kyoto Animation. I did enjoy the innumerable (all right, 2 or 3) Munto remakes, though, so I gave this a fighting chance to the end.\r\nIt was... all right, but following the heels of Clannad and K-On (both tough acts to follow), it felt lacking. This isn't KyoAni's strongest work.\r\nI think there are two principal reasons for this: (1) For most ofthe show, the heroine is like the trees in Japanese school plays. We really don't see her developed until the final 2 or 3 episodes of the show, and after that she goes right back to being Happy Mochi Girl (her childhood friend/hetare Mochizo is even worse). (2) Dera, and to a lesser extent the other characters, steal the show.\\n\\n\r\nI think the production crew was deliberately avoiding the \"mascot character = cute little animal that talks, explains stuff, and is cute/comic relief\" trap and hoped that Dera would be kind of a partner to Tamako, which would have been great had there been actual chemistry between Tamako and Dera. Unfortunately Tamako wasn't written as a particularly assertive girl, and where a different character would be like \"Get off my head nao!\", she's more apologetic: \"No, he's not my pet, he's just sitting there.\" In contrast, Dera is written as a preening, strutting narcissist. You'd have to make him comatose to prevent him from stealing the spotlight. He has his moments (\"de-panning your bird bread\" is probably the biggest LOL I had in the show, the comedic timing was perfect), and making him the comic foil to Choi helped a bit, but I feel like his role could've been smaller, or better yet, Tamako written as a better straight girl in this double act.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know exactly why, but I found Dera grating on the ears. I guess Takumi Yamazaki (fun fact: he voiced Isamu Dyson in Macross Plus) was cast because he does a hilarious squawking voice, but the rest of the character feels like Jouji Nakata's voice might be a better fit. I won't go so far as to say it's a miscast, but I feel as though the timbre of the non-squawking voice was a little on the high side.\\n\\n\r\nSo what do you do with an upstaged heroine? KyoAni's answer was \"not much\", unfortunately. We get episodes that feature her friends, her little sister Anko, the merchants of the shopping district, her father and mother... but it seemed as though developing the central character was off-limits until the very last minute. I found Kanna more interesting, and it's not like she got an episode of her own. This was frustrating to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere was better chemistry between Tamako and Mochizo than between Dera and Tamako, and yet it seemed the production was going out of its way not to further their relationship. I can understand doing this if, say, Tamako was a bit more of a cliche shojo character (An \"I don't want to admit to myself that I love you\" sort of thing), but in this show it's like any attraction on her part is surgically removed. It just doesn't feel organic, for lack of a better word-- it felt like an invisible wall in a AAA video game, and it felt ridiculous considering the importance they put on the \"everybody loves somebody\" episode. It's as though someone high up the food chain didn't want a straight-ahead romantic subplot or was saving it for a sequel/film... which, credit where it's due, does eventually happen in Tamako Love Story.\\n\\n\r\nI'm still wondering, was there a good reason to hold off until the film? A good part of me says, \"Nope-- the show would've been a lot more interesting if the characters of Tamako and Mochizo were more dynamic.\"",

            "content": "Tamako Market is one of the worst things KyoAni has ever created. I'm sorry. There's no way around it. I wanted to love Tamako Market. I desperately tried my best to enjoy every episode, yet, I absolutely couldn't. Everything was just way too mediocre for me. I'm a huge KyoAni fan, but I gotta call it like I see it.\r\nLet's start with the few good things that Tamako Market has to offer. KyoAni has pretty much never failed when it comes to animation. The winning streak continues here. Everything is full of color and life. Character designs, while simple, fit the show and what ithas to offer. \\n\\n\r\nMusic, as per usual, is great. I love the OP soundtrack. Definitely can listen to that for days upon days. It joins the ranks of other OP's that I don't skip after the second episode. The ED is nice. Nothing too special. When it comes to the soundtrack in every episode - it works. Literally have nothing bad to say about the soundtrack at all. \\n\\n\r\nTamako Market suffers greatly in the story department - more so than any other KyoAni I've ever seen. Here's the thing. There's pretty much no story to speak of in Tamako Market. I mean, there's a \"story\", but it's barely there. It's one of those things that's brought up at the beginning of the first episode and then kinda slumbers for awhile. Then, before you know it, the story awakens near the end of the series. But by that point in time, it was too late and I had already suffered enough. \\n\\n\r\nDon't me wrong... I don't need a story when it comes to slice of life anime. In fact, some of my favorite slice of life anime have no story at all. Lucky Star, A-Channel, YuruYuri - all of these contain little to no story, but I love them anyway. The reason they work is because of the humor and characters. Sadly, the humor hear is pretty poor. Many of the jokes fall flat and don't have a lot of weight to them. Timing is also off when it comes to certain gags. The majority of the humor used in Tamako Market is something I like to call \"cute humor\". It's basically characters doing cute things, like children, in order to make the audience laugh. Some of the humor worked for me, but I wasn't laughing for the majority of the series. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, there's not really a whole lot to talk about. Tamako, the main character, is alright. She's a cute girl who who does cute things. She's nice. And.... well.... that's about it. I actually liked Tamako quite a bit, but she felt out of place. Her character would be better suited in the world of Aria. Tamako isn't necessarily a strong character, but it's hard not to like her. She's an angel - harmless. Tamako also has some friends, but they aren't memorable at all. I honestly can't say much about them. They're in every episode and they do stuff. That's their job - to do stuff. Tamako has a little sister as well named Anko. And guess what Anko does? She does stuff. Some cute, and some no so cute. She's just kinda there. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a character in Tamako Market who shows up every now and then that works at a flower shop, named Kaoru Hanase. He appears to be a trans. I don't think I've ever seen an anime that represented the trans community so fairly. I greatly appreciated the fact that he wasn't used as a character to be made fun of or seen as a joke. He was represented equal to everyone else. I'm not trans, nor do I know anyone who is, but I thought that was rather sweet. KyoAni could've easily gone the other route and used his character as a tool for jokes. Definitely respect KyoAni for not going that route, although I woudn't have been too offended if they did.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now.... the bird..... \\n\\n\r\nThis guy really deserves his own paragraph because, in a way, he is the virus that made me suffer as much as I did while watching Tamako Market. He has a name - Dera Mochiyucky, but I'm going to be calling him \"bird\" for this review. Why? Because he deserves no respect for the torture his character put me through. This piece of work was annoying from start to finish. Before watching Tamako Market, I assumed that the bird was only in a few episodes. I also had no idea he could talk. But boy.... I was wrong. I hated everything about him. His character design, his voice, his humor - it infuriated me to no end. At the end of every episode, he would say a few lines that were supposed to be meaningful, but they never meant a thing to me because it was HIM saying those lines. Would've been better and more appropriate for Tamako to say such things. In my opinion, one of the worst characters in the history of anime. Dreadful. Awful. Stupid. Just the worst of the worst. Literally had no choice but to lower my rating by one full point due to his presence, which rarely ever happens when I watch anime. \\n\\n\r\nTamako Market is one of the weaker efforts from KyoAni. The only reason I rated it a 6/10 is because of the beautiful animation, the score, and Tamako. If this were made by any other studio, with a low budget, it would probably get a 4/10 or 5/10. If you are a die hard fan of KyoAni, then I guess I would say to give this series a go. It's harmless. It won't leave you angry the entire day or anything. There are no villains either. It just kinda felt like a waste of time for me.",

This is one of the main factors that separates this shows from other shows of its type. Careful detail is given to how each and every character moves and emotes their face. This gives a great amount of information tothe viewer in a fun and interesting way. It engages the viewer and makes them think, which helps create a relationship between the characters and the audience. \\n\r\nThe main plot of Tamako Market revolves around small moments of joy and growth that one pertains when interacting with a community. These range from different types of communities as well.  Such as family, friends or strangers. These small moments are perfectly captured throughout the story in nearly every aspect of its production, and is never convoluted or mislead. \\n\r\nMusic was fun and poppy and thrived in small moments just like the theme. \\n\r\nThe feeling of progression is missing though. Or at least it is not obvious. Someone can look back and see how the characters have changed throughout the story but is almost subconscious in the characters and the viewers mind. This is great but the emotional bits lack impact because of it.  That and the characters could have been more complex. \\n\r\nAll in all GOOD SHOW GO WATCH\\n",

The reasons I dropped this series (twice) is because I thought that the talking chicken-like bird was weird. However, I underestimated this series. I thought that because it was a comedy, slice of life anime I would t enjoy it, but when I picked it up for the third time I ended up really enjoying it. Yes,there is a lot of comedy and obviously it is a slice of life, but if you think about it hard enough you don't get a talking bird visit your family store and say that they are searching for a princess to marry their childhood friend who is a tropical prince. Surely this has to be fantasy? There are also a lot of snip-it scenes that show romance is alluring!?  One of the episodes even goes into a little detail about it, too! What I am going to finish off with is that you shouldn't let the MAL Tamako market page fool you, this is a really interesting anime and I would really recommend it!",

He's the source of pretty much all that's funny and he adds a \"magical\" flair to the show. The story itself is \"there\" but not really. What I mean by this is that, while the reason of Dera's presence (and later on Choi) influences the overall theme, it doesn't really have a presence in the episodesthemselves (it doesn't even really come into effect until the last two or three episodes). Rather, they are about Tamako and the residents of her little market and how they interact- and Dera. There is no real resolution and most everything, other than just one thing really, is left open-ended, as is to be expected with this kind of show. I would recommend this anime to anyone that has some free time and is looking for something cute, funny and heartwarming to watch.",

As of right now, the story is nothing special, it seems almost vignette in nature. The episodes are set apart by a month, and the episodes seem to be separated by holiday. I'm not sure of the significance of this, but so far it's an okay way to tell the story.\r\nTamako, her father, the bird, and Mochizou seem to be the only interesting characters as of yet. The other two girls, Kaana and Midori seem to beonly cardboard cut outs for Tamako to have beside her as \"school friends.\" That seems to be okay because the series' main focus as of now is to point out how special Tamako is to the shopping district and everyone around her. I don't know why she's so special yet as she's a stereotypical, lovable, moe character, but I'm sure as I watch more there will be more of a rhyme and reason as to how that is. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, the series is using K-ON!'s popularity with the art style to draw potential viewers in. The art style is gorgeous, I'm not going to lie, but the style is so copied that the series seems hardly original, and looking at comments on episodes, they are already comparing the characters to characters from K-ON! I fear that this series is only trying to piggyback on the success of the moe that is K-ON! and may fail in the story department as a result of attempting to replicate the popularity of another show. Will the story get better? I'm not sure, but as of right now things look a little cloudy for Tamako Market. I'll keep watching for sure, as there are some loose ends that will be interesting to see tied up, but as of right now I fear that this happy moe train will crash into K-ON! fandom and not stand alone as it's own anime.",

            "content": "The slice-of-life genre has always been simple. Now, Tamako Market is simple, but also effective. It's about the daily lives of the residents of a shopping district, focusing on Tamako, the daughter of a mochi shop owner.\r\nThere's not much of an over-arcing storyline in the first half, but the latter part tells a good story with a few episodes. The more episodic episodes aren't bad, though, setting up for the end part where the story gets good.\r\nThere's more emotion in Tamako Market than other anime in its genre, and this becomes more apparent in the aforementioned latter part of the story.\r\nThe art is KyoAni, soit's obviously fantastic. The character designs are very nice as well, and they are done by the same person as the designs in K-On! and Kokoro Connect. Not much else to say here.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is good fun to listen to at the start of every episode, and the ED is catchy and relaxing. The rest of the soundtrack is nice, with special mention going to the insert song of sorts, Koi no Uta. Seriously, the way it's used in the series is just perfect.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character in Tamako Market is likeable - some are better than others (Kanna is best girl), but none are 'bad'. Everyone has a role in the series, and a vast majority of the more central cast get some great development. And there's even a woman who's voiced by a man (leading some people to believe they're a transvestite).\\n\\n\r\nI loved watching Tamako Market. It's a slice-of-life done right, and some of Kyoto Animation's best work. While there may be a lot of reviews that call it average, I believe that this anime is a 9/10. And if it doesn't appeal to you, well, that's that.\\n\\n\r\nJust remember: Everybody loves somebody. This will become important if you watch the movie, Tamako Love Story.\\n\\n",
