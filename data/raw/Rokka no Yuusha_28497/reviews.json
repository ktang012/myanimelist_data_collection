            "content": "The quickest way to pique my curiosity is with the \u2018mystery\u2019 tag. It often has me dusting off the magnifying glass and getting set to put my perception to the test. Rokka no Yuusha stepped up to the plate this season and its plot summary had me interested: A show where six heroes try to fight off a great demon but seven show up for the job instead. One character gets picked on early as the infiltrator and it\u2019s up to him to prove his innocence. Rokka no Yuusha didn\u2019t end up testing my intelligence though. Instead, it decided to insult it. \r\nIf there\u2019s onebig tip you could give to anyone writing a classic \u2018whodunnit\u2019 tale then do this: Give everyone a solid reason to be confirmed suspicious. If you start to abandon characters then the strength in your writing falls by the wayside. This lack of equal screen time and development made it incredibly easy to rule certain characters out as the \u2018extra\u2019. The show feels like it is written to cater for an action show, not a mystery one. The focus is on set pieces and not a study into its characters. That\u2019s the fatal flaw. In a show that clearly tells us early on that it\u2019s going to be show about catching the villain in disguise, it abandons even trying to be an interesting and challenging mystery. With paper-thin characters, convenient solutions, characters that scream fanservice over depth and a bizarre ending, Rokka no Yuusha will not be a show that hangs around in the memory bank for the right reasons.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand those who enjoyed the anime because there\u2019s some action, suspense and some passable characters to get you by. If you\u2019re after an anime with some solid action, but nothing ground breaking, then this may satisfy you. I, however, felt betrayed by the show not living up to its potential and betraying the mystery path it started to construct in its opening half. A harsh sentiment? I maintain the show dug its own hole deeper with every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is focused around Adlet Mayer, the self-proclaimed \u2018strongest man in the world\u2019. He is one of the six chosen heroes to defeat the demon god. When seven people arrive at the meeting location Adlet quickly becomes the prime suspect in the hunt for the \u2018extra\u2019 person. We watch as he tries to clear his name. Adlet himself isn\u2019t a memorable protagonist but he does have his moments. The way he tries to rally others to his cause is at least believable for the most part. His relationship with one character in particular is easily the most interesting part of the story, a relationship challenged by the other party\u2019s motives and their background. It\u2019s such a pity that this sort of development couldn\u2019t be spared for all six other members of the group and actually go some distance towards making the mystery more engaging. It\u2019s true that a 12 episode limit plays its part in limiting that but that\u2019s no excuse whatsoever for not at least making an effort to improve in that area. There are some hilariously silly conveniences towards the back end of the show as well that don\u2019t do any favours towards correcting the aforementioned writing flaws around the cast. For every logical deduction made towards finding the culprit another ridiculous one strikes back. Often the show misleads you into thinking it\u2019s making progress when it\u2019s really just creating vapid excuses for the characters to come into conflict with one another.\\n\\n\r\nGiven my sentiments at the start of this review, I\u2019d be going into spoiler territory if I were to discuss the impact of the rest of the cast. What I can say is that it\u2019s an eclectic bunch of characters who each bring a different ability and personality to the table. Some feel like they\u2019re playing an active role in the story while others just feel like they\u2019re there to make up the numbers. Some character dynamics exist but there aren\u2019t enough connections established between the cast early on to keep me interested in the big reveal that lays ahead. As previously mentioned, you can feel that certain characters being named the seventh would be too underwhelming. Too much of the cast fit this bill.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is a rollercoaster in the quality department. The show looks average as a whole but the early episodes certainly look the part. In fact, the first episode probably set the bar too high, especially with one scene which looks excellent. The variety in environments from the early episodes get lost as the show goes on and that\u2019s a real shame. The story lends itself to this fact but a lot could still have been done to breathe a bit more life into the areas where the bulk of the series takes place. A lot of the CG also is jarring when placed next to the traditional animation (what a surprise).\\n\\n\r\nRokka no Yuusha treads this bizarre line between being an action and a mystery show and fails at succeeding in either genre. Tension in fights doesn\u2019t exist because the show doesn\u2019t give me a chance to empathise with or understand the majority of the cast. It makes the show very difficult to recommend. If you\u2019re after a satisfying mystery, forget it. If you\u2019re after some action, perhaps. Me? I put the magnifying glass away early on.\\n",

            "content": "This review won't contain any spoilers regarding the series other than stuff that have already been written in the synopsis which is, of course, spoiler-free to divulge into. I should also note that this review is solely written from my anime-only watcher perspective, as I did not read the original material.\r\nStory:\r\nRokka no Yuusha unfortunately does not give the best first impression regarding it's actual story line and genre for people that are looking for a series to start. It gives off the impression of it being your average demon-fighting fantasy anime, and it's understandable to think of it as such at first glance.\r\nBut that's notreally the case. Or well, it's not really the case for the part that was adapted in this anime. The series is actually a niche mystery fantasy focused series that focuses into the vast Mesoamerican fantasy world and to find the potential impostor among them. As the synopsis for this anime points out.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, the anime may give the impression of being stale, or boring. But the suspense in it between the main characters is something that is not easily found in your average anime. The settings of the series may not be the most original out there, but it is without doubt executed phenomenally\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe anime production is done by Studio Passione. As far as I am aware I consider this to be it's first major production. The anime has gorgeous colours and background visuals, especially at it's first episodes. Some of the background visuals could easily be considered to be put as wallpaper considering its exotic beauty.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately due to it's lack of success and it being the studio's first true production, the quality of the animation and art drops midway during the series where it's quite evident that the animation feels sketchy or/and has a lot of cutscenes. The facial expressions proportions are sometimes off too. I wouldn't call it completely bad, I find it acceptable and in the important scenes it thankfully delivers great quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest gripe about the visuals regarding the series is definitely the CGI.   It is not very pleasing and they look awkward, thankfully the CGI usage is minimal halfway through the series except for select few moments.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all the art shines at the beginning, then decreases to being acceptable. I don't think a series should be completely judged upon it's production issues in certain episodes.\\n\\n\r\nPlease note that art in itself is a subjective matter, whether someone thinks X looks good, Y could see it as negative, so all of this is simply my opinion regarding the matter, it is not an objective fact. the only thing that can be considered as \"fact\" is that it have gotten inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI find the sound in the anime to be fitting to the theme that it presents. The first opening gives you the feeling of it being a fantasy show, not necessarily the best sound out there, but it conveys what the show is about at that time. While the second opening tries to fit into more of the dark atmosphere of the show at that point in the series. I don't have a solid opinion regarding the ending but I did definitely like the two other endings that are character-centric. It's a nice touch musically, especially that the characters themselves sing it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is eerie at times, I never once thought that it wasn't fit. The music is done exactly where it should be done. It compliments the atmosphere that the show is trying to display. It's rare to find such a nigh-perfect placement sound for certain scenes, but Rokka No Yuusha implements that effectively.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the sound is not outstanding if it's viewed on it's own, it's done in a fashion like it's an exclusive musical piece for the specific scene that is happening. And that is something that I personally respect from composers that pay respect to the art that they're working on.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting cast does well for the the type of personality they're working on and there is no monotone voices, and the sound-effects are definitely well fit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThis field is definitely where the series shines best at. Despite the fact that the show is only 12 episodes long. The cast has a very distinctive personalities and roles that are easily recognizable. They're also for the most part all incredibly likable to the audience. Their developments in such a short period is amazing, and it's very evident as to how the characters changed from their first appearance.\\n\\n\r\nThis includes the main character. The main character is not your average lead hero. He tries to reach to the best conclusions in the most logical way, and he's humane. May be naive at times, but he looks past his naivete if the situation asks for it. The same falls for the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not surprising that this category is the show's best field. Because the plot revolves around the cast, and how they act depending on the situation that is presented to them. All of the cast have their own motives and desires and are explored thoroughly. The designs are rather attractive as well, but aesthetics are completely subjective as pointed out previously.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nRokka no Yuusha is an incredibly enjoyable anime. It's clever. It never feels repetitive. Every episode has it's own new content for the watcher to explore through and think about the mystery surrounding it. It's very great at displaying suspense between every episode end for the watcher to watch the next. It's definitely a series that is worth watching in one-go.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like tension (edge of the seat feel) and character-centric fantasy show this is definitely the type of show that I'd recommend to watch. Unfortunately, this series suffers from the point that it will most likely remain incomplete (anime-wise)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review and any feedback is appreciated on my profile, as this is my very first review.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019d describe Rokka no Yuusha (Braves of the Six Flowers), a fantasy show that\u2019s more than just about swords fighting or saving the world. Well initially, it sets up it like so with its background story. Apparently, it\u2019s revealed that a Demon God existed a long time ago whom annihilated humanity. And now, its return is imminent. Six heroes (or otherwise, known as braves) are chosen by the Goddess of Fate to apparently fight the Demon God. The catch is that there is a fake hero as the story introduces a \u201c7th brave\u201d. Main male protagonist Adelt learns the hard way of what exactly itmeans when suspicion falls upon himself.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the light novels written by Ishio Yamagata, the series takes on an interesting approach at fantasy and adventure. Rather than the group traveling together to fight against enemies and reach the final boss, there\u2019s inner fighting between the heroes themselves. The cause of this is because of the existence of a 7th hero whom the others label as a traitor or double agent. So in essence, the show follows more into a mystery genre as the story progresses. We meet Adelt, the self-proclaimed \u201cstrongest man in the world\u201d in the beginning. Perhaps the cleverest of the heroes and we find out about his past based on his background story. His role in the series becomes prominent because others begins to suspect him as the fake hero. \\n\\n\r\nAs a show with such a colorful cast of characters, we are also introduced to the other heroes. All of them possesses their own unique traits, personalities, and abilities. These include Nashetanya (princess of Piena and Saint of Blades), Fremy Speeddraw (Saint of Gunpowder), Goldolf Auora (Nashetanya\u2019s loyal follower), Chamo Rosso (the Saint of Swamps), Hans Humpty (the mysterious assassin), and Mora Chester (the Saint of Mountains). The show quickly establishes the fact that none of them can be trusted. Unfortunately for Adelt, he becomes a prime target after several implied facts labels him as \u201cthe fake hero.\u201d It sets up a good amount of storytelling as the series immediately shifts into a fantasy/adventure/mystery hybrid. What I also find interesting is how we learn more about the characters including their reasons for being there along with the various hypothesis that focuses on the mystery aspects of the show. Initially, some people might misjudge Rokka no Yuusha and think it\u2019s a typical fantasy story with plain swords fighting. But when it comes to the mystery elements, it\u2019s where each episode begins thrilling enough to anticipate what may happen next. The episodes connects each other in clever ways because of the theories and implied facts. The mystery aspect gets more and more complicated as fingers are being pointed at each other among the seven braves.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are also fairly interesting by individual standards. Fremy Speedraw is the lone wolf with a cold heart and dark past. Labeled by others as a brave killer, she is also a prime suspect in the beginning until Hans begins tearing Adelt\u2019s story apart. One of the most intriguing part of the series is her relationship development with Adelt. It\u2019s hard to say exactly their nature as Adelt trusts her but she doesn\u2019t in return on most parts. As they spend more time together though, some of this begins to change as Fremy wishes to learn more about him. Hans also becomes a character that will catch the audience\u2019s attention. Not only does he seem to be the most mysterious but he is also very intelligent with his deductive thinking. The way he analyzes Adelt shows his wits as a critical thinker. This seems to contrast with characters such as Chamo and Goldov who seems to be only there for their own personal reasons. Chamo doesn\u2019t even seem to care much about who the fake brave because of her childish and perhaps borderline insane personality. Goldov just seems to be there because of his undying loyalty for Nashetanya. Speaking of which, Nashetanya herself is also shrouded by mystery regarding her true alliances and personality. It seems that her personality actually changes depending on who she interacts with. Throughout the series, it\u2019s hard to not also label her as a suspect of the fake seventh brave. Finally, there\u2019s the level headed thinker, Mora. Becomes of her calm personality and age, she is seen in regards as the leader of the braves. Although as time goes on, she displays more of desperation to kill the fake hero. What to say about all these characters? They all seem so different but their common goal is the same: to get rid of the mole and kill the Demon God. The catch is that the show focuses a lot more on discovering the fake hero rather than their collective journey. As a show that present itself this way, it can be a hit or miss for certain fans. Personally, it\u2019s something that I welcome with its refreshing concepts. It inspires theories from the viewers and let ourselves think who may be the fake hero. Additionally, the show does a fairly well job at establishing its world fiction and background history. What may be disappointing is the pacing as the show only adapts the first volume as a 1-cour series. In other words, certain parts of the original story is omitted while we don\u2019t learn a whole lot about our main characters (example: Chamo, Goldov, Mora). Furthermore, the relationship dynamics seems to focus more on Adelt and Fremy than any other character in terms of depth. The others only seems to be there for their own reasons such as Goldov\u2019s loyalty to Nashetanya or Chamo\u2019s respect for Mora. It\u2019s a bit of letdown for anyone who is more curious about the other heroes as their characterization isn\u2019t as strong as Adelt or Fremy.\\n\\n\r\nPassione is a fairly new studio as they\u2019ve only recently worked on Rail Wars, a show that is easily forgettable. Taking that aside, I would say that the artwork aspects of Rokka no Yuusha exceeds expectations. The world fiction is fascinated illustrated with the resourceful mountainous regions. There\u2019s also inspirations that are drawn from the Azetc-like architectures and gorgeous views of the dense forests. Temples are also decorated with high class fantasy characteristics and Kyouma (the monsters that are spawned by the Demon God) heightens the legitimacy of their world\u2019s danger. Furthermore, the character designs of the main characters are all very distinctive with their combat gear, fighting style, and even animal motifs. The action of the show is also very well performed with good amount of cinematic body movements and clever camera angle timings. There\u2019s little fan service although some of the CGI designs of the Kyouma can be distracting at times. But all in all, it\u2019s a fairly well produced show that is hard to forget when its art department is mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is also strong enough to keep up with the rest of the series. The OP theme song has two parts \u2013 the first half gives off a general impression of the show while the second half is more symbolic of the main characters. Some of the ED theme songs are also performed by the characters\u2019 VA themselves, something that I found quite unique. Speaking of which, the character voice mannerisms all are noticeable whether it\u2019s Hans\u2019 cat-like dialects, Fremy\u2019s cold voice tone, or Mora\u2019s commanding presence. The show also does well with its OST particularly when the mystery aspects kicks in with its more eerie coordination. Some of the underwhelming performances will probably be Chamo as her childishness can be borderline annoying or Goldov\u2019s single minded role. Adelt is really also a character that people will find to like or hate just by his personality matched by his voice. But despite that, the soundtrack and voice performances still show of what Rokka no Yuusha is capable of. And that\u2019s definitely not something so easily accomplished in a show like this especially with it being so talky and filled with dialogues.\\n\\n\r\nWhat can be said about Rokka no Yuusha in the end? It\u2019s a fantasy series but not one you will expect to be like from the beginning. Yes, there is still action and magic like the most of the typical stuff fans are used to these days. But unlike others, Rokka no Yuusha adapts with its premise that will hook the viewers into getting into the show more and more. Rather than just watching, it\u2019s also anticipating what the audience will think who the fake hero is as the story progresses. With a good degree of high class fantasy setting and colorful characters, it\u2019s also hard to also ignore those aspects of the show. No, it\u2019s not Dangan Ronpa or Btooom that becomes more of a survival game. Instead, Rokka no Yuusha stands out on its own as not just a fictional fantasy/detective story but also a creative engine with all sorts of matching gears.",

After so many series with the same concepts in the anime industry, this series proved that there is still more quality stories out there. This show is actually great. In fact, the series is certainly different than the others. As I watched this series, I thought, \u201cThis is what I was looking for\u201d.  Frankly, the storyline for this anime is naturally fantastic but I found it acceptable by simply kicking out the logic. That's what we always do anyway. The character design is nice and clean without too many blemishes. Each character's clothing is cute and suits their personalities. This is an aspect that makes the anime worthwhile. I also thought that the realistic hair color of the main character is unique and out of white hair trend. This is a simple fact where they made a right decision because I\u2019ve started to get bored with this kind of trend. Yeah, it looks fantastic at first, but then all characters with white hair become the same characters we\u2019ve seen as any other series. The difference is just they are not from the same series.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter \\n\r\nWhile on the other hand, the characters from this series are more energetic and are generally pleased. At the worst, the character is fairly pleasant and occasionally quite good personalities. I'll never get bored with all of them. For starters, I really love the main lead. Although he is considered stupid and weirdo by each of the characters (not to mention he is the weakest one in terms of powers), he does not let this kind of thing get him. He's simply using all the knowledge that he has learned to ensure the fight is in his grasp. Not too impetuous and stupid for a main character. He uses anything as he sees fit for his advantages for all the fights. If you\u2019re looking for an over powered main lead, you\u2019ve chosen the wrong series. This series is focusing more how he succeeds to go this far using all the experience he has learned. He works really hard to go this far. This is an honorable action for him to take. The atmosphere for each episode gets tense as we are afraid something bad will happen to all of them. This is none other than our affections to see all of them are safe. We\u2019ve taken a liking to them without us even realizing it. The show is also consistent throughout the series that they have not wasted time for idle chat. Even if there is, it's solely for character development. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\r\nThe art is pleasing in its cuteness.  I would like to say the art and animation is definitely well done and pleasing. As a result, we are treated to a highly quality animated series.\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\nThe music is pleasant in the show. The Op and Eds for the series are quite catchy and very intriguing for us to listen. I watched both Op and Eds to the very end. I loved seeing all the characters perform in those two. They were like dancing for each other and lend itself well to the warm atmosphere. The music in the series provides a cheerful feeling but also some deep emotions. I found it rather sad like something painful is hidden. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall \\n\r\nIn truth, though, I liked the girls, especially Fremy Speeddraw. Initially she is quite harsh and rude, but as the story goes on, I just couldn\u2019t help from falling in love with her. Not to mention she is actually a cute girl right from the start. Her harsh and suspicious attitudes result in more of deep affections. She is probably a special one in a thousand girls. I\u2019m not simply seeking a Tsundere type here, but she is just more than whom you call an attractive person. You will only realize it when you have been struck by her cuteness and completely fawn over her. In all honestly, Fremy unfeeling of emotions doesn\u2019t stop her from being a personal favorite character of mine.\\n\r\nWhile certainly not perfect, Rokka no Yuusha is very fun and enjoyable to watch. It slowly builds up the characterization it is satisfying in the end. I quickly grew to love all the characters. The show is well written and paced. It's a bit depressing when knowing this series has come to an end. Still, I got quite a ride with the series. Give the series a shot because this series has great potential and will hook a lot of fans by no time.\\n",

            "content": "If I told you guys that Rokka no Yuusha was a mystery show and you took a look at this anime at first glance without any background information whatsoever, you\u2019d probably wonder if I was off my pills again. Well maybe I am, but the point is that yes, despite the fact that the setting, characters, and overall driving force are as standard fantasy as they come, Rokka no Yuusha\u2019s plot belongs to the whodunnit side of the genre with plenty of suspects and a lot of circular logic to be had. Which doesn\u2019t exactly change the fact that I\u2019m still watching standard fantasy adaptedby a studio whose last anime was freaking Rail Wars, an anime with so much false advertising attached to it that Burger King advertisements look truthful by comparison. But I do like mysteries, so this standard fantasy was worth taking a look at at the very least. See if this mixing of genres turns out an exciting combination or a generic kitchen sink.\\n\\n\r\nTwelve episodes later and all I can summon for this show is a resounding \u201cmrgh\u201d, which is pretty much a combination of \u201cmeh\u201d and \u201curgh\u201d if you didn\u2019t quite get that. A more common word to describe my judgement would be \u201cmediocre\u201d, which isn\u2019t the worst thing to happen when it comes to the \u201cLN adaptation\u201d field, but you\u2019re reading the wrong guy if you think I\u2019m going to excuse a \u201cbetter than usual\u201d product from a medium whose very form of entertainment runs on poor working conditions and sex crime. Because there was potential for true greatness here with just a little more polish could have made a good mystery anime or even a good character study. Instead, Rokka no Yuusha is pretty much a bad anime made pretentious from its inability to execute its unique ideas properly.\\n\\n\r\nSo the show takes place in some fantasy land where six chosen heroes called Braves must vanquish a great evil called the Demon God, and said Braves are chosen by crests marked on their body from the Goddess of Fate due to their unique abilities. Our focus character is Adlet Myer, a guy who proclaims to be the strongest man in the world and resolves to prove said boast by invading tournaments and wooing ladies whom are more likely to kill him than they are to listen to his big mouth. After said shonen behavior combined with his skillful fighting gets him marked as a chosen hero, he teams up with a bunny girl princess - and I know some people have been praising the Mesopotamian symbolism that was added in by the anime staff, but it\u2019s hard to take anything knee-deep in religious culture seriously when one your characters looks like she\u2019s wearing an extra costume from a Tales game. It\u2019d be like if Haibane Renmei made Reki wear a jockstrap and a beanie the entire runtime.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, he teams up with said princess and meets up with other Braves along the way before they all gather at a temple, only to realize there are seven of them. Naturally, one of them has to be an imposter working undercover in order to sabotage their mission, and when Adlet is suspected due to some circumstantial evidence against his favor, he must avoid the fighting prowess of his comrades whilst figuring out which one of them is trying to set him up. The fact that it takes four episodes to even get to the mystery plotline is one big point against the show\u2019s favor, but whilst things start getting exciting afterwards, the show peters out of energy fast. Whilst I applaud the team\u2019s decision to just adapt a single volume into twelve episodes because they realized that it can only go downhill from there, by the time the finale rolled around, I had long since stopped caring who the imposter actually was because this team doesn\u2019t seem to understand how to make a mystery interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe big elephant in the room is the production. I\u2019m not going to mince words: it is freaking crap, with tons of bad CG and awful cinematography. Even with the studio\u2019s clear lack of money and resources compared to the big wigs, it probably wasn\u2019t in their best interest to hire a director who\u2019s pretty much made a career out of nothing but borderline porn and a LN adaptation that most people consider to be a classic but I consider to be rubbish. There\u2019s this one scene at the end of the fourth episode where the camera tries to build tension by rotating around the room for over a minute Sonic 2006-style to the point that it gave me nausea whilst simultaneously making me want to punch the person who approved that shot in the face. And it also doesn\u2019t help there is quite a bit of fighting in this show, where the few scenes of decent choreography are let down by the lack of in-between animation during moves compounded with horrendously out-of-place CG monsters and magic make them incredibly unexciting to watch. Sometimes, the director shoots the action so close to the camera that I can\u2019t even tell who\u2019s aiming at who or whether someone got hit or not. This is far from the budget issues that plague Ushio and Tora. This is just incompetence that makes Gangsta look like John Wick.\\n\\n\r\nBut no amount of production issues can make me overlook how padded everything is. Once the mystery actually starts, too much of the runtime is spent on the actual deductions and getting from Point A to Point B rather than making said transitions meaty so I'd care about them. Very few of the characters are actually interesting because aside from Adlet and an eye-patched girl named Flamie, we barely get to know them apart from the fact that they come from some fucked-up places and have their own ideologies on how to kill, namely in how fast and cruel they want to do it. There's a little bit of the \"clashing of philosophical conflicts regarding different ways of life\" that made the author's last work, The Book of Bantorra, fun to watch, but it is very neutered here because it mostly manifests in lame action and circular logic that is repeated endlessly doesn't go anywhere rather than something actually challenging. I can't even remember what that knight who protects the princess actually does, let alone his name.\\n\\n\r\nThe development given to the more characterized of the bunch isn't so hot either, because it's mostly just flashbacks regarding racism or idealism that are incredibly hackneyed in execution before resulting in a token romance that is as believable as the scientific study that humans only use 10% of their brain in daily life. And to make it more frustrating, said token romance ends up as nothing more than an \"I hate you. Well I love you\" affair, which is pretty much the third-world country of romance all on its own. However it wasn't the worst thing in the world, so I gave it a pass. And despite the story having no rewatch value whatsoever because there's not much there beyond the actual deductions along with there being no point in watching a mystery again if you know the mystery, I was willing to give the show a \"well it wasn't that bad\" recommendation to people who have lower standards than I do. But then those last few minutes occurred and they ruined everything. Going to be mild spoilers here, but I can't exactly conclude the review without mentioning this, so if you haven't watched this show and take offense to learning anything beyond what's written on the synopsis, I'd advise you to stop reading right now. Also, those who can't handle my hate speeches should probably stay way too.\\n\\n\r\nIf you spend the entire runtime having your characters overcome a challenge, only to rehash that challenge for your sequel-hook ending without so much as a break in-between, all goodwill suddenly disappears when you realize that the authors weren't taking the subject material as seriously as the audience was. It's a cheap method of baiting your audience whilst ensuring that they have nothing to look forward to but the same old shit should they ever make more of it (and I very much doubt they will), and it didn't help that it just put further stakes into the token romance that it quite frankly didn't need. Nothing is more designed to aggravate the mind than substance-less stories with cliffhangers, especially ones that have had absolutely no foreshadowing whatsoever or so little foreshadowing that it doesn't matter either way. And seriously, a freaking cow uniform? You're jealous of a girl in a cow uniform? And cow uniforms are considered suitable fighting clothes in this universe? At least the bunny suit looked mobile, let alone like appealing eye-candy.",

            "content": "Review Anime\r\nRokka no Yuusha\r\nReview Text\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe main plot is pretty simple, with six heroes chosen to defeat a great evil. So why did I give it a 9/10, instead of the 6/10 it \"surely deserves\"? That's because the author decided to add a twist to it: instead of six heroes, he added a seventh. In that case, one among the seven would forcefully be a traitor.The details added to each episode are all meaningful to the end of this series, which explains the slow pace. The slow build-up paid off big time by the series' end. It will keep making you think until the veryend. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nJust like my previous reviews, I won't bother with the art, since it's a very subjective category. However, I should note that the animation is on par with the standards, without CGI, and that the characters look quite different from one to another. I love the old Meso-american-styled clothing and environment though, it's pretty fresh and new. Aside from all of that, the camera angles were absolutely splendid.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nJust like Art, I won't bother, because these two are the most subjective themes ever, though I'll say that the main character's voice actor did a good job at handling the \"cocky\" and confident personality of Adlet Mayer. Fremy's voice actress made a very great portrayal of her character and sounded extremely realistic. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe character section is really the one thing that sets Rokka no Yuusha apart from a \"regular\" anime. Though Adlet looks like a typical shounen character on the first scenes, I'll assure you that he really isn't, following the gathering of heroes, with the tension building up around him. Also, Adlet, as a main character of a supernatural/fantasy anime, surprisingly does not harbour any magic nor superhuman characteristics, despite the magic-imbued/superhuman comrades. In this aspect, he represents the audience and is a character which all of us viewers are able to relate to. The other heroes do well in their own areas, complementing each others and Adlet himself as a character. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nAs I said, I love the old Meso-American civilizations-inspired environment, as it gives off that exotic look to soothe my tired eyes, usually staring at schools, classrooms, cities or wastelands when watching anime. And as I previously mentioned, I love the characters and their respective quirks, along with the tension built around them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nDespite even being a completely truthful adaptation of the original light novel, Rokka's current rating on MAL (7.83/10) is pretty disgustingly low as of today, 20/09/2015 \\n\\n\r\nBoth Rokka's and Mahouka's anime adaptations ROUGHLY HAVE THE SAME RATING (7.83 vs 7.80) \\n\r\nWTF\\n\r\nMAL, ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT WHAT SEPARATES A SHIT-TIER ANIME TO A GOD-TIER ONE IS BUT A MEASLY 0.03/10?!\\n\\n\r\nNotice/Credentials: I read the novel version, so my knowledge on the franchise is rather extensive.\\n",

            "content": "Alright - Having completed this great piece of Anime, I feel it's time for a review.\r\nRight of the bat Rokka no Yuusha approached as solid anime for the Summer 2015 collection with episode 1 already leaving me in the wait for episode two with what was the start of a good story line, art which i found to be nice, music and an overall ambiance that suited well, characters that was lovable. So let's break this into individual segments:\r\n- Story: Great - Not much more to say if you had to give it one word. Great suits Rokka no Yuusha's story as it is inno way original but the way they presented was glorious, and you kind of forgot how \"straight forward\" the story was in the middle all the tension this anime left you with for each episode after the middle segment. All in all the \"uncertainty between peoples when there's one more than it should be\" can seem flat-line, but not when executed like it has been done here. And then ONTOP of this - what that became the whole plot summary for this season, we still got the full story-line behind and in front us of regarding the original objective of the Braves.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for Rokka no Yuusha get's a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\n- Art: Lovely, with all the different types of anime these days - breaking them apart eventually becomes difficult for certain people (Looking away from those who has gone over the edge to make a own special style) and in no way was the art of Rokka no Yuusha MINDBLOWING, but it was not this boring, dimmed down, bad colored type either. The art was just fine and lived up to the atmosphere that the anime gave us, remaining colorful and beautiful while at the same time having this grey stone strike here and there to remind us of the situation our heroes here are trapped within. A work of perfection presented in a decent manner.\\n\\n\r\nArt style: 7/10.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound: Oh the sounds, the music and the general layer of what they put in the background of this anime was part of what made it so great - Making sure that they properly match the music with the scenery (Which sounds weird to point out but they amount of animes I've seen f*** that up is mindblowing) and everything in the background during the slow and silent segments, it all created this passive atmosphere that followed me all the way from the first episode to the last, and it did a great job in doing so.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters: How I loved them all, or well - Most of them. The crew of Rokka no Yuusha was put together in a great manner, it is not each day I see a team of seven people in this style of situation - that either goes along or fight's to death and still manages to maintain their individual characteristic foundation. Rokka no Yuusha delivered more than plenty in terms of characters, making them unique in such individual ways while still not going over the edge while doing so - and at the same time give some of them development traits that in no way damaged the show itself. I was taken away by all seven of them and that for a damn good reason.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s): 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and the overall: If it has not been clear until now - I have absolutely loved this show. So much that it pains me to the bone knowing that the season is already over and that we don't ALREADY have a season two confirmed (As of this entry) scares me. A great anime with some of the better characters I have seen - not only in the year of 2015's anime round up but overall across the different anime's I have had the joy of watching, great art and beautiful music - Rokka no Yuusha is a work of greatness that everyone should see and I absolutely recommend anyone reading this to give this anime a go if you already haven't.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it for my review, fingers crossed for a season two - thank you so much for reading and have a great time watching anime:\\n\\n\r\nTotal score roundup: 8/10.",

            "content": "Expectations are a very powerful thing. After all, whether you like it or not, this world revolves around first impressions. After reading the brief synopsis for the show and taking in the promotional art, I personally thought that this show would be the standard kind of fantasy adventure where a group of friends band together and use the power of their bonds to overcome evil. The first two or so episodes would have you believing that this was the case too. However, after digging through that first layer of information, Rokka no Yuusha reaches a point where it can develop what it wants and whatit wants to develop are the relationships between each individual brave.\\n\\n\r\nFor all intents and purposes each of the braves that were selected by the goddess to kill the demon king are more or less strangers (with a couple of exceptions). Because of this unfamiliarity between one another once the big reveal that a seventh brave has been planted within their group is made known no one really knows who to trust. Adlet, our main character, has been traveling with Princess Nashetanya since the beginning but how much does he actually know about her. Maura is the leader of all the saints but who is to say she does not have her own agenda. This feeling of uncertainty permeates the latter two thirds of the show and creates a great sense of tension that feels natural and keeps the watcher engaged. \\n\\n\r\nInitial suspicions on who the fake brave is falls on Adlet and, without a convincing means of proving his innocence, he escapes into the forest. From this point the show\u2019s pace becomes noticeably slower. While the first three episodes had our heroes all making a long trek to rendezvous at a certain meeting spot the rest of the show takes place within a barrier that cannot be escaped until the seventh is identified. In one regard this kills all of the forward momentum that has been building up and anyone who came to this show with the idea of a grand adventure may be deterred. On the other hand this slower pace is what makes it feel like there is a lot at stake and what lets the writing shine.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a mystery show the writer needs to keep the final reveal a topic of discussion. Subtlety is key. After all, there is no fun in a mystery when the culprit is obvious. Rokka no Yuusha plays around with this by dropping facts that may seem rather arbitrary in the grand scheme of the story only to make you recall that fact when it plays a role in solving the mystery. This attention to detail and care is impressive. Very little was ever done in the show that did not have some bit of importance to the story, no matter how small it may seem. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum things up Rokka no Yuusha surprised me. I was surprised by the sudden change of adventure to mystery. I was surprised by how thought out this show was given the outward look of a typical shounen. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this show. The pacing of the show is a bit spotty and there are a handful of nitpicks I have that I will not go into detail about but I never felt that these factors ever took away from the experience.",

This is one of those anime.\r\n     When I look for anime to watch, I usually look over the covers, and if I like the art or premise, then I move on to read the summary. The cover art for this anime suggests that it is a fantasy action one, with a group of heroes fighting a demon lord. Just a normal fighting anime. However, the actual story was far more complex, and though that made melove the anime even more, some people may have found this disappointing.\\n\r\n     The reason for this anime having a somewhat low rating is, I believe, because all the mystery lovers don't watch this anime while the action lovers do. And neither get what they want. Especially the latter, who saw this anime for some cool fights, and got a mystery and few fighting scenes.\\n\r\n     Another confusing aspect was that the first 2 episodes gave off a \"going to fight the demon lord\" vibe. It got mystery fans uninterested and the action fans excited. It is such a shame, because the story is so good and the characters are interesting, but that aspect was only briefly shown in those episodes.\\n\\n\r\n     So in the end, what I want to say is, all you mystery lovers, go watch this anime. For those of you who like epic action scenes, this anime may not be for you.",

            "content": "The first episodes where decent, but when the plot actually started I quickly realized that this was not going to be pretty, or good for that matter. The way the conflict was handled was straight out childish and badly thought out. All the theories being supported by baseless speculation and sircumstance, turning what could have been a more psycological mystery into a basic witchhunt. \r\nAlso you can not have a story where one out of 7 people is a traitor, and also have me care about them. By me knowing that one is a traitor I can't trust what anyone is saying. You never knowif someone is lying or not, or if they have an ulterior motive. This resulted in me feeling uninvested and bored during what was supposed to be emotional scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I want to bring up is just how pointless it all was. Wasn't this about defeating the Demon Lord or something? The whole anime felt like a sidequest that took up way to much time. Adding to the fact that the ending was incredibly unsatisfying, not only is the story unfinished, but they actually had the balls to pull the same plot twist a second time, right at the last second, meaning that we're almost back where we started.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: A thousand years ago the demon god appeared and began to take over the continent however was stopped by the legendary Saint of the Single Flower. After driving the demon god into a deep slumber she foretold that it would awaken again one day and that six heroes bearing her power would rise to defeat it and once again drive it into dormancy. Cycles of these Braves appeared to face the demon god every several hundred years after the Saint's disappearance and were all successful and now the demon god will soon rise again and sotoo must six new heroes. Adlet Mayer (Saito, Soma), the self-professed strongest man in the world, is chosen to become one of these heroes. After congregating with the other Braves it is discovered that they number as seven rather than six and the task of discerning the impostor sets them all at odds as each member grows more suspicious of the other and the demon gods awakening approaches.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Rokka no Yuusha is fairly small as the story is heavily focuses upon Adlet and the six other Braves however this allows for the show to investigate each of the characters to a great extent in the absence of a larger number of characters. Adlet is certainly the character most worth talking about as he stands out distinctly even amongst the other Braves. On the surface is resembles a somewhat typical adventure fantasy protagonist - he is incredibly strong-willed, sincere, and quite ordinary in ability-set in comparison to his fellow Braves. That being said, he is highly perceptive and intelligent in how he fights and problem-solves - both traits lend themselves incredibly well to the story which at a basic level is a mystery. His fighting style is unique and his utilization of traps, crude sciences, and the environment sets him apart from most other characters, especially so from the other Braves most of whom wield powerful magics such as the conjuration and manipulation of swords, gunpowder.\\n\\n\r\nRefreshingly, Adlet is by no means the only intelligent character within the Braves and each member has a strong sense of agency within the plot with perhaps the exception of Goldof. Despite the characters being perceptive and rational, each of them continuously arrive at different opinions concerning the seventh Brave and impostor and what makes them so compelling is that each of their conclusions are legitimized and well-founded. While their character designs are a bit outlandish at first glance they fit well within the aesthetic of the world and I found that I got used to them quite quickly. Rokka no Yuusha is one of the few shows that I can say kept me on my toes as far as which character I put my faith in and trusted as the dynamic of the group and the personality of each character all meshed differently as the plot developed and new information came to light. \\n\\n\r\nThe show takes the time to get to know each character and their reasoning both stays consistent with the characterization presented while also evolving as they do throughout the story which added a strong feeling of consistency to the show's underlying logic. The show is hardly all cold-logic and there are plenty are plenty of emotional characters like Fremy who keep the show engaging in that regard as well. I also can't underplay the uniqueness of each of the Braves in relation to each other as, beyond what they believe, they each come from vastly different walks of life, have distinct mannerisms and speech patterns, and interact with each other in different ways. \\n\\n\r\nThese traits and differences exhibited by each character account for my reasoning that their presence is definitely a strong-point of the show and its focus on character drama and interaction is well founded.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was at first a pretty significant concern for me when the show started out however by the end I was quite happy with how it improved and ultimately handled itself. The initial 3 or 4 episodes suffer a bit from poor character designs and mediocre CG work on the part of the Fiends however after that point the show picks up consistency-wise a great deal - the character designs are far better represented and their animations as well as the movement of the camera become a great deal more smooth and dynamic as opposed to what was initially presented. Baring the first few episodes, the show is strong aesthetically in this area and though it falters at times I would say that animation shouldn't be a concern going in.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that immediately caught my eye that I found interesting all throughout the series was the world and setting established which felt highly influenced by Aztec structures and buildings. It was an aesthetic I had not seen before in anime and Rokka no Yuusha did a great job bringing it to life. The influence present in the setting can also be found in the character designs which accounts for some of their flamboyant appearances however this too I found to be quite interesting and fun after a turn. The vibrant designs of the other Braves further set Adlet apart who's design is more typical and muted both alienating him on an aesthetic and often a cognitive level while also adding a unique flavor and style to the show that I can't claim to have seen elsewhere.\\n\r\nThe show doesn't boast terribly great CG and the Fiends are both bizarre in appearance and execution however luckily we don't see them all that often after the central drama of the story begins and their later appearances in the show are handled slightly better. That being said the poor use of CG was one of my initial concerns with the show but luckily Rokka no Yuusha improved dramatically as time went on and while I would not list the visuals necessarily as a strength of the show, I would say so of the unique designs and aesthetic.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the first 3 or so episodes of the show came up a bit short and the actual premise of the story doesn't arrive until the 4th episode however I wouldn't say that it's plot was terrible beforehand. Rokka no Yuusha doddled a bit before arriving at its premise however once getting to that point it changed dramatically and what I first hard dismissed as a vanilla, demon-killing, action show turned into a mystery-centric, battle of both logic and physical prowess as the Braves clashed with one another. The early episodes also differ noticeably in terms of pacing and the show slows down a great deal for a few episodes midway as it unpacks the logic and implications of the Braves' dilemma however I found this to be far more engaging than what was present prior and the methodical pacing in the mid and latter parts of the show was highly enjoyable. The show does an amazing job juggling suspicion from what character to the next and I, as a viewer, found the way in which Rokka no Yuusha approached the mystery genre to be highly compelling in its presentation of developments and perceived facts.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the strongest point of the story outside of the plot itself was its ability to first evolve into something far more cerebral than what was first laid out but also its ability to maintain the action and adventure feel established early on while evolving immensely elsewhere was impressive. Perhaps even more impressively - it never felt like the latter action was happening for action's-sake but rather it occurred quite naturally within the context of the situation and the intelligence exhibited by the characters and plot felt present within the action sequences as well through their strategic progression and execution. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is quite slow in how it unfolds as it is almost entirely focused upon its premise of there being seven Braves and one impostor and so it may disappoint those who were more interested in the premise in its entirety and its conflict with the demon god and the role of the six heroes. Hopefully the show receives a future installment however the point at which it ends gives a full and pleasurable conclusion to the events at hand, resolving both the mystery and conflict while remaining open.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music was good all throughout and the soundtrack had a handful of  memorable songs. The area where I felt Rokka no Yuusha succeed the most in a musical sense was in how its songs were diverse to the point that they lent themselves well to the heroic, action adventure setting present in the premise of the story while also presenting an apt selection of music to support the show's mystery themes and the many high-tension moments therein. The music matched the tone of the show well in each of it's endeavors and intricacies and was certainly one of the points of success attributing to the show's overall enjoyability. \\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nRokka no Yuusha surprised me, plain and simple. What initially felt like one of the seasonal action shows where stereotypical heroes run around and combat monsters rendered in poor CG rapidly became something extremely engaging and special. It has its fair share of problems such as its lackluster animation and art early on and occasional quality drops throughout however these negative elements pale in comparison to the areas in which the show triumphed. \\n\\n\r\nRating: 8\\n\\n\r\nI gave Rokka no Yuusha an 8 because of its compelling and self-involved cast of characters, its unique aesthetic and combat feel, and the intelligent nature with which it explored its own evolving plot in dynamic and rational ways. The missteps in the art and animation department hinder it from scoring any higher for me and some of the character interactions were not as convincing and well-conceived as others however  the end-product of these things was nothing less than enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who finds themselves classically interested in show's that come off as well-figured, logical, or rational would like the manner in which Rokka no Yuusha plays out as the characters provide compelling reasons for why they think what they do and act accordingly. For the same reason I would recommend it to any purveyor of the mystery genre as it presents an engaging plot in this regard and the manner in which the show allows you to postulate yourself rather than keeping the viewer purposefully in the dark was a strong point of the show. The show has good action and should attract those interested in the more tactical side of combat however those interested in this category will have to find enjoyment in the rest of the show as the fighting intermittently takes a backseat as the show unfolds. To those who look into the show, I do highly suggest reaching at least episodes 4 or 5 before deciding to drop as that is where the show is most transformative.",

            "content": "Rokka no Yuusha, or Rokka: Braves of the Six Flowers, was an anime I watched for two principle reasons: A friend I know who doesn't watch a lot of anime watched it and enjoyed it, and I thought the summary on MyAnimeList looked interesting and unique. I am most definitely a sucker for these kind of shows that play around with the \"group of destined heroes\" concept. Of course, you might not know what if you watched the show and, say, cut it off after 3 episodes.\r\nThe start of Rokka no Yuusha is somewhat deceptive and is more the kind of start you would expectfrom your standard light novel fantasy adventure: A braggart hero interrupting a flashy tournament, a cute and naive princess contrasted with a dark and brooding cool haired girl and, someone pretty obviously set up to be a rival. These episodes aren't bad, but they aren't especially notable when you're starting out, they are the kind of episodes that are actually a lot better to rewatch than to first watch, as they contain a surprising amount of foreshadowing for the series. In many ways, the series can be said to have truly \"started\" in Episode 4, when the series moves from a fantasy adventure piece into a closed room mystery action piece.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there, it gets fairly interesting. I had heard some complaints before that the mystery was \"too obvious\" but while it isn't DEEPEST MYSTERY EVER WHOOOA or anything I thought it was perfectly acceptable. The ultimate suspect is not one I suspected for the most part and the method actually did trip me up from expectations. Given this anime is 12 episodes and only 8 take place in the closed room setting, I found the mystery aspect more than acceptable and actually rather fun. This does bring me to one issue I had: With only 12 episodes and 7 prominent characters, roughly half of which are not introduced until 1/3rd of the series is in the books, some characters pretty clearly fall by the wayside in terms of how much we really get to see of them and their depth or complexity. Adlet and Hans for example get good character examination, while Maura is left rather bare.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, this was a rare show where I would say I did not dislike any characters in it, although most did not stand out to me especially strongly either. Hans was probably the best, you get a pretty good sense of who he is and how he works with some multiple facets without even getting to learn much in the way of backstory or anything. And while it isn't exactly \"character\" in the same sense, Chamot's character was pretty fun and not what I expected in the first place...and the surprise reveal of her power set was actually one of the most memorable parts of the show to me. It is quite a trip.\\n\\n\r\nOne character interaction I felt was somewhat off was the romance part, specifically involving Adlet and Fremy. On Fremy's end it makes sense given her backstory, character and the fact she seems less committed to it, I thought it was less than believable from Adlet's end and stuck out like a bit of a sore thumb. I have heard that the Light Novel has some more explanations for it...but I can't exactly grade the anime for something outside of it and it stuck out to me. The ending is also something that makes sense, I assume it was the same cliffhanger at the end of that Light Novel volume, but in the context of the anime it felt pretty out of place and was one of the parts of the show I more disliked. It felt somewhat cheap and more like it should be at the start of a season two first episode than the end of this show's. And I'm not sure how much I like the direction it is implying it will go to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this show is pretty hit and miss. Stuff like the fight scene in Episode one and some of the exposition after has some really pretty art but at the same time the CGI in this show is generally fairly bad. I don't just mean the monsters, where it seems to be trying to give them an otherworldly quality but fails to do so (compare to the D-Reaper from Digimon Tamers for example despite being a much older show), but another thing they do is these odd panning shots which are painfully and obviously done in CG. They cut down on these with time, but they prominently stood out to me most of the time they happened and not in a good way. Also, the second opening had some slightly jarring parts to me that stood out repeatedly when I watched it. I did for the most part enjoy the character designs a good deal...although I am sad they didn't give Fremy a freaking shirt because I would love the outfit a lot more if it did. Sound is mostly positive with some good voice actors, in fact that's what bumped the Sound to an 8 here, I thought the show actually had some pretty good voice acting, most obviously from Hans, Fremy and Chamot. It had some good ambvient sound and some pretty good songs as well, overall it was pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what's the final verdict? Rokka no Yuusha isn't a masterpiece, that much is certain, but it is a fairly fun and good show. It explores its premise with a reasonable amount and combines it with solid and memorable if at times a bit lacking characters. It combines this with some fun action, leading to a show with an overall \"Good\" quality that nonetheless does not especially stand out. The very end is a bit lacking, but largely coming off the heels of the mystery's wrapping up being done pretty well. If the premise or designs interest you, definitely give it a whirl: It is ultimately pretty enjoyable. If they don't, though, I wouldn't necessarily explicitly seek it out, as it does not do a ton outside of what it advertises.",

            "content": "Rokka no Yuusha is an anime which you can't really judge from its cover. The synopsis makes it seem like yet another generic fantasy anime about a group of chosen heroes trying to save the world from some evil Demon God, but in reality the story itself is totally different. In fact, Rokka no Yuusha is primarily a detective-style mystery anime about a group of people with a traitor in their midst where they have to use logical reasoning and deduction in order to try to figure out who it is.\r\nIn short, the story is about six \"Braves\" who are chosen by the Goddess ofFate. They're given supernatural powers and tasked with defeating the Demon God who threatens the lands. So they all set out on a journey to do so, but when they finally meet each other, they suddenly find themselves trapped inside a magical barrier... and notice that there are seven people in the room. It is impossible for there to be seven Braves instead of six, and thus they quickly deduce that one of them is a fake and a traitor. But who is it, and how do you prove it? Well, in a nutshell that is more or less what this anime is about.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, the mystery is not much more than a closed room problem, but the scale quickly ramps up and over time there is more and more information revealed about the Braves themselves, the supernatural aspects of the world, certain scientific elements and more. This means that all the clues to the problem are not actually presented in the very beginning, but are rather expanded upon as the show progresses. Because of this, you're left with very little chance to try and solve the problem yourself as a viewer after the mystery is presented, and instead the anime just reveals the solution to you step by step over time. Of course this is nothing more than a different style of writing so there's nothing wrong with doing that per se, but personally I vastly prefer to be given more ability to think for myself when I'm watching a detective mystery, so I was a little bit disappointed by this.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that must be talked about is the pacing. Rokka no Yuusha is an extraordinarily rare case of a light novel adaptation which has an entire season covering just *one* volume of the source material. That's right, 12 episodes for 1 volume. That's about 3-4 times slower pacing than what you'd normally see. This comes with a couple consequences: the good news is that it's extremely detailed and never feels rushed whatsoever, and the bad news is that a lot of time is wasted on matters that feel rather pointless and irrelevant. For example there is a very forced romance subplot going on throughout the anime which really doesn't feel like it adds anything worthwhile to the story at all. There's also the simple truth that the plot doesn't really progress very much with every new episode due to how slow-paced it is. I didn't get the chance to do so myself, but I reckon Rokka no Yuusha ought to be a lot more suited for marathoning than watching weekly.\\n\\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the main character cast consists of the seven (supposed) Braves, including our protagonist Adlet Mayer: the self-proclaimed \"strongest man in the world\". Personally I don't really like him very much because he's extremely arrogant and constantly has to remind the audience of just how strong he is every five minutes, and it gets annoying pretty fast. The other characters aren't given too much backstory or depth simply because they have to remain \"mysterious\" so that they all will seem more or less evenly suspicious. And that's fine and all in theory, but it also renders them rather uninteresting and one-dimensional (at least as far as the viewers ever get to know that is). The most likeable one to me would be the human/kyouma hybrid Fremy, but even she can pretty much be summarized in a few sentences. So Rokka no Yuusha's character cast is fairly uninspiring as a whole, but on the other hand they're all more or less treated as plot devices for the sake of the mystery rather than actual people anyway so I guess that's somewhat understandable.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is not very flashy, but it does its job and fits the tone of the series very well overall. However it's pretty obvious that this is a fairly low-budget anime, as the character designs are oftentimes rendered in very low detail whenever they are in the background of a scene, and the CGI doesn't always look as good as you'd like. But for the most part at least I think it looks fine. The OP and ED themes (it actually has multiple ones) are again nothing spectacular by themselves, but they fit very well with the overall atmosphere of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, Rokka no Yuusha is an anime which is not afraid to break norms, and presents a type of story which is not only unexpected but also a rarity to see in anime. However it also feels a bit like an ambitious experiment that never quite manages to reach up to its own potential. But even though I don't think the anime turned out quite as good as it theoretically could have, it's still a lot better than most, and originality is always a plus in and of itself.\\n\\n\r\nOne final thing that must be taken into consideration though is that for anime-only viewers, Rokka no Yuusha might not turn out to be an entirely satisfactory experience. Like I said before, the anime only covers the very first volume of the light novels and nothing more, so for anyone who doesn't like to read books, you really don't get to see very much of the overall story at all. The initial premise was for the Braves to go out and fight some evil Demon God after all, right? Well that never happens, not even remotely close. Also as far as I've seen, the light novel sales boost from the anime has been rather underwhelming to say the least so I wouldn't put my hopes up for a second season ever being adapted either. However if you try to forget about the story of the world itself and instead focus solely on the detective game, then you can still consider it to be a somewhat conclusive ending. Despite that though, the final seconds leave you with a giant teaser for upcoming arcs, so you might have some trouble turning a blind eye to that part.",

            "content": "Into the Bullshit Fantasy Rabbit Hole: A Rokka: Braves of the SIx Flowers Review\r\nMysteries often work well in the form of a new mystery every episode or just one throughout the course of a feature length film. They are a lot harder to pull off when they\u2019re stretched throughout entire seasons. For me to really look back at mystery and remember it fondly, it needs to keep me entertained and have an extravagant or well thought out conclusion. Rokka: Braves of the Six Flowers did not have that. Instead, it had a litany of problems in terms of explanation and execution, plus a motley crueof characters that left my interest fading in and out.\\n\\n\r\nRokka kinda falls down the bullshit fantasy rabbit hole when it comes to explaining what the fuck is going on. Adlet tries to determine one of the numerous ways that the seventh brave used to trap them in the barrier. Most of the explanations are based around fantasy laws and most of those are quickly shot down by more magical rules. When your reasoning is created from made up things, instead of science and logic, then the conclusion is going to severely lack impact. \u201cWhy was there fog? Oh, because of the fog shrines. But wait! Fog shrines can\u2019t overlap sun shrines, so that doesn\u2019t work!\u201d I\u2019m para-phrasing, but you see what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nNot only are these explanations total nonsense, they\u2019re also a big waste of time! SO much time is wasted from boring exposition that there\u2019s little left to actually enjoy. There are little fight scenes here and there, but they mostly don\u2019t last longer than a couple minutes, which totally sucks because they have the strongest warriors on the planet (or wherever they live) and that would\u2019ve made for some awesome brawls! But I shouldn\u2019t judge something based on what I think it should be, but rather by what it is.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the characters, um\u2026what can I say? They\u2019re underwhelming. They lack personality. And they\u2019re all kinda stupid. Adlet\u2019s stupid because he claims to be the strongest man in the world, then nearly gets killed over and over and over, without beating anyone in the process. Fremy\u2019s hot and has cool gun powers and a fucked up eye, but she\u2019s also a copy-and-paste revenge character. She doesn\u2019t think past her weird plan for revenge, and, well, that\u2019s it. Nothing new to bring to that archetype. Hans is something, and so is Chamot. Don\u2019t really have much else to say about them. Mora turns out to be really stupid and a big, dumb liar that jumps to conclusions. Nashetania\u2019s also attractive, and Goldof is her volunteer bitch slave.\\n\\n\r\nSo, uh, that\u2019s that. A really bland and poorly constructed mystery that takes too long to get to the conclusion. An unsatisfactory conclusion, made possible by a lousy cast and nonsensical explanations.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and as far as the music and animation go? Meh. The animation was okay and the OPs and EDs were not memorable in the least. At least, they didn\u2019t make me want to go to YouTube and listen to them on their own. But that;s just my opinion.",

            "content": "I have seen a lot of valid criticism here that I do agree with and a lot I don't agree with so im going to try and convince you that this show is worth a 10 despite its flaws. Before I get into the review I would like to say that the criticism that this show isn't what it was advertised as is true. This anime does not belong in the mystery genre but more the action genre. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nConsidering the way the anime was set up a story that was anything more than decent wasn't really needed as the story basically only needed toassemble the relevant characters in a certain area and then trap them with the idea that there is a traitor among them. I was pleasantly surprised when the story not only fulfilled this part of the story admirably but also added little parts of world history that were not needed but really created depth. The tales of ancient hero's who walked their path before them and the whole saints concept really created a much more interesting story than I had imagined and I really hope there is more anime set in this world. This said the story is of course not perfect and at times is a bit cliche. My main issue with the story is that instead of having some clever ending to the mystery of the traitor it just sort of involved magic whenever it needed to explain something difficult.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe bar was set high on the first episode with brilliant art, smooth animation and scenes that were an absolute pleasure to watch. This quality wasn't maintained at a constant throughout the anime but the whole thing was none the less a very beautiful anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much stood out here. The music was good, the characters well voiced and the sound effects appropriate. None of it was overly memorable however.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI love good characters and thats what we get here. I found that the characters were refreshingly unique and didn't stray into the anime tropes. There were no harems, the females don't all fall for the main protagonist for no reason, relationships actually do develop instead of remaining stagnant etc.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed seeing the developing relationships between close characters and watching new friendships get formed. I liked the quirky and original personality's of the characters that set them apart and made each one unique. \\n\\n\r\nMost of all I loved the main character who wasn't some overpowered bad ass (despite his claims that he was the strongest man in the world) or some weakling who let others fight for him but a intelligent character who fought using every trick in the book. He never fought fair but used his array of tools and trickery to win the day (or at least try to win it anyway). The main character had the usual issue of being seemingly morally perfect but besides that I found no issues with the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile this anime never lived up to its claim of mystery it did instead contain some of the most enjoyable anime fights I have ever seen. The hero's didn't always win and they didn't recover just from some moral bullshit. Not only was the action exciting but the entire anime was enjoyable to watch due to its great art and interesting story. Really I cant think of a single moment I didn't enjoy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is without a doubt one of my favorite anime ever and as such you should remember that my review comes with just a little bit of bias. Nevertheless I will argue with anyone who puts this anime below a 7.",

            "content": "Approaching Rokka no Yuusha with the expectation of a moderately-average fantasy story will meet you with quite the surprise! For me, the surprise was quite pleasant.\r\nAs far as premise goes, Rokka no Yuusha is your typical heroes hunt down the demon king storyline. It's been done hundreds if not thousands of times before, and the premise itself never really becomes anything notable. However, the unexpected area where this show shines is in its characters! The story almost writes itself with the characters as the focus, rather than preparing for the next plot-event in the \"epic\" storyline. The cast felt very genuine and dynamic and allgrew on me to the point I was almost rooting for all of them. And that bit about \"rooting for all of them\" is what makes the small bit of story we got here actually quite interesting. Minor spoiler-warning...\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime isn't the tale of heroes defeating the a demon king, but the story of the heroes finding each-other and building trust. The plot is of the greatest danger facing those chosen as heroes, being their search for each-other while they're separated and vulnerable. This sets up a \"who-did-it\" scenario which challenges these heroes abilities as-well as reveals truly who they are as people. This is honestly a brilliant way of introducing characters in a story as they show eachother who they truly are. And the story serving the characters isn't all that allows them to be good, the design of this mystery plot-line is handled well enough that surprisingly I really didn't know who it could be at times. In my defense though, the whole mystery relies too heavily on magical lore that isn't laid-out even to the characters beforehand and is nigh deus-ex machina'd along when it's serviceable towards the confusion. However, even with its contrived setup, the story does very fairly distribute its accusations and the characters are for-the-most-part very rational about the situation (except that little girl). Another great thing about the characters is they really are tested and develop in satisfying ways, while also budding a surprising and unexpected romance that felt very genuine and believable.\\n\\n\r\nThere is issues with the show though, being around its weakest link - its visuals. There's a lot of horrible cgi for the creatures of the world, and it really is horrible most of the time. The actual animation also isn't that impressive and lacks a lot of consistency with the characters proportions. The backgrounds also grow quite derivative and unimaginative, basically making most of the world look like a tropical forest. The directing, however, is great (as expected by the man who directed Spice & Wolf). The soundtrack is also fantastic, creating an atmosphere very along the lines of the game \"Shadow of the Colossus\" (the constant horse-rising and Egyptian stone-age theme helping with that). Overall, I really felt the staff created something that felt original in presentation, while not that creative still.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all this praise though, the main thing that holds Rokka no Yuusha back is that it's incomplete and feels a small part of a great journey. If the development of this journey continued to be as ambitious and risky as this segment, I'd have loved to watch more and might've ended it with an even higher score. However, the ending of the anime gave me a feeling the coming story might be more along the lines of the generic demon-king plot, so maybe it's for the best? I'll definitely be reading the novels though to find out.\\n\\n\r\nI usually don't agree with the idea that a show gets better as it goes along and to \"keep watching til it gets good\", but this really is a show you have to put in six episodes to really see what it's about. Even once the main predicament starts, I was convinced it was a brief bit of the anime with an obvious answer to \"who-did-it\". The characters are also introduced in archetypal ways that someone who likes a more rich cast might be instantly turned off, but I assure you there is something to these characters if you give them a shot. Yes they are goofy at times, including their designs, but the characters really have a lot of charm (except for the newcomer at the end who I despised). Give it a shot!",

            "content": "The quickest way to pique my curiosity is with the \u2018mystery\u2019 tag. It often has me dusting off the magnifying glass and getting set to put my perception to the test. Rokka no Yuusha stepped up to the plate this season and its plot summary had me interested: A show where six heroes try to fight off a great demon but seven show up for the job instead. One character gets picked on early as the infiltrator and it\u2019s up to him to prove his innocence. Rokka no Yuusha didn\u2019t end up testing my intelligence though. Instead, it decided to insult it. \r\nIf there\u2019s onebig tip you could give to anyone writing a classic \u2018whodunnit\u2019 tale then do this: Give everyone a solid reason to be confirmed suspicious. If you start to abandon characters then the strength in your writing falls by the wayside. This lack of equal screen time and development made it incredibly easy to rule certain characters out as the \u2018extra\u2019. The show feels like it is written to cater for an action show, not a mystery one. The focus is on set pieces and not a study into its characters. That\u2019s the fatal flaw. In a show that clearly tells us early on that it\u2019s going to be show about catching the villain in disguise, it abandons even trying to be an interesting and challenging mystery. With paper-thin characters, convenient solutions, characters that scream fanservice over depth and a bizarre ending, Rokka no Yuusha will not be a show that hangs around in the memory bank for the right reasons.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand those who enjoyed the anime because there\u2019s some action, suspense and some passable characters to get you by. If you\u2019re after an anime with some solid action, but nothing ground breaking, then this may satisfy you. I, however, felt betrayed by the show not living up to its potential and betraying the mystery path it started to construct in its opening half. A harsh sentiment? I maintain the show dug its own hole deeper with every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is focused around Adlet Mayer, the self-proclaimed \u2018strongest man in the world\u2019. He is one of the six chosen heroes to defeat the demon god. When seven people arrive at the meeting location Adlet quickly becomes the prime suspect in the hunt for the \u2018extra\u2019 person. We watch as he tries to clear his name. Adlet himself isn\u2019t a memorable protagonist but he does have his moments. The way he tries to rally others to his cause is at least believable for the most part. His relationship with one character in particular is easily the most interesting part of the story, a relationship challenged by the other party\u2019s motives and their background. It\u2019s such a pity that this sort of development couldn\u2019t be spared for all six other members of the group and actually go some distance towards making the mystery more engaging. It\u2019s true that a 12 episode limit plays its part in limiting that but that\u2019s no excuse whatsoever for not at least making an effort to improve in that area. There are some hilariously silly conveniences towards the back end of the show as well that don\u2019t do any favours towards correcting the aforementioned writing flaws around the cast. For every logical deduction made towards finding the culprit another ridiculous one strikes back. Often the show misleads you into thinking it\u2019s making progress when it\u2019s really just creating vapid excuses for the characters to come into conflict with one another.\\n\\n\r\nGiven my sentiments at the start of this review, I\u2019d be going into spoiler territory if I were to discuss the impact of the rest of the cast. What I can say is that it\u2019s an eclectic bunch of characters who each bring a different ability and personality to the table. Some feel like they\u2019re playing an active role in the story while others just feel like they\u2019re there to make up the numbers. Some character dynamics exist but there aren\u2019t enough connections established between the cast early on to keep me interested in the big reveal that lays ahead. As previously mentioned, you can feel that certain characters being named the seventh would be too underwhelming. Too much of the cast fit this bill.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is a rollercoaster in the quality department. The show looks average as a whole but the early episodes certainly look the part. In fact, the first episode probably set the bar too high, especially with one scene which looks excellent. The variety in environments from the early episodes get lost as the show goes on and that\u2019s a real shame. The story lends itself to this fact but a lot could still have been done to breathe a bit more life into the areas where the bulk of the series takes place. A lot of the CG also is jarring when placed next to the traditional animation (what a surprise).\\n\\n\r\nRokka no Yuusha treads this bizarre line between being an action and a mystery show and fails at succeeding in either genre. Tension in fights doesn\u2019t exist because the show doesn\u2019t give me a chance to empathise with or understand the majority of the cast. It makes the show very difficult to recommend. If you\u2019re after a satisfying mystery, forget it. If you\u2019re after some action, perhaps. Me? I put the magnifying glass away early on.\\n",

            "content": "This review won't contain any spoilers regarding the series other than stuff that have already been written in the synopsis which is, of course, spoiler-free to divulge into. I should also note that this review is solely written from my anime-only watcher perspective, as I did not read the original material.\r\nStory:\r\nRokka no Yuusha unfortunately does not give the best first impression regarding it's actual story line and genre for people that are looking for a series to start. It gives off the impression of it being your average demon-fighting fantasy anime, and it's understandable to think of it as such at first glance.\r\nBut that's notreally the case. Or well, it's not really the case for the part that was adapted in this anime. The series is actually a niche mystery fantasy focused series that focuses into the vast Mesoamerican fantasy world and to find the potential impostor among them. As the synopsis for this anime points out.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, the anime may give the impression of being stale, or boring. But the suspense in it between the main characters is something that is not easily found in your average anime. The settings of the series may not be the most original out there, but it is without doubt executed phenomenally\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe anime production is done by Studio Passione. As far as I am aware I consider this to be it's first major production. The anime has gorgeous colours and background visuals, especially at it's first episodes. Some of the background visuals could easily be considered to be put as wallpaper considering its exotic beauty.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately due to it's lack of success and it being the studio's first true production, the quality of the animation and art drops midway during the series where it's quite evident that the animation feels sketchy or/and has a lot of cutscenes. The facial expressions proportions are sometimes off too. I wouldn't call it completely bad, I find it acceptable and in the important scenes it thankfully delivers great quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest gripe about the visuals regarding the series is definitely the CGI.   It is not very pleasing and they look awkward, thankfully the CGI usage is minimal halfway through the series except for select few moments.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all the art shines at the beginning, then decreases to being acceptable. I don't think a series should be completely judged upon it's production issues in certain episodes.\\n\\n\r\nPlease note that art in itself is a subjective matter, whether someone thinks X looks good, Y could see it as negative, so all of this is simply my opinion regarding the matter, it is not an objective fact. the only thing that can be considered as \"fact\" is that it have gotten inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI find the sound in the anime to be fitting to the theme that it presents. The first opening gives you the feeling of it being a fantasy show, not necessarily the best sound out there, but it conveys what the show is about at that time. While the second opening tries to fit into more of the dark atmosphere of the show at that point in the series. I don't have a solid opinion regarding the ending but I did definitely like the two other endings that are character-centric. It's a nice touch musically, especially that the characters themselves sing it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is eerie at times, I never once thought that it wasn't fit. The music is done exactly where it should be done. It compliments the atmosphere that the show is trying to display. It's rare to find such a nigh-perfect placement sound for certain scenes, but Rokka No Yuusha implements that effectively.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the sound is not outstanding if it's viewed on it's own, it's done in a fashion like it's an exclusive musical piece for the specific scene that is happening. And that is something that I personally respect from composers that pay respect to the art that they're working on.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting cast does well for the the type of personality they're working on and there is no monotone voices, and the sound-effects are definitely well fit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThis field is definitely where the series shines best at. Despite the fact that the show is only 12 episodes long. The cast has a very distinctive personalities and roles that are easily recognizable. They're also for the most part all incredibly likable to the audience. Their developments in such a short period is amazing, and it's very evident as to how the characters changed from their first appearance.\\n\\n\r\nThis includes the main character. The main character is not your average lead hero. He tries to reach to the best conclusions in the most logical way, and he's humane. May be naive at times, but he looks past his naivete if the situation asks for it. The same falls for the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not surprising that this category is the show's best field. Because the plot revolves around the cast, and how they act depending on the situation that is presented to them. All of the cast have their own motives and desires and are explored thoroughly. The designs are rather attractive as well, but aesthetics are completely subjective as pointed out previously.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nRokka no Yuusha is an incredibly enjoyable anime. It's clever. It never feels repetitive. Every episode has it's own new content for the watcher to explore through and think about the mystery surrounding it. It's very great at displaying suspense between every episode end for the watcher to watch the next. It's definitely a series that is worth watching in one-go.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like tension (edge of the seat feel) and character-centric fantasy show this is definitely the type of show that I'd recommend to watch. Unfortunately, this series suffers from the point that it will most likely remain incomplete (anime-wise)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review and any feedback is appreciated on my profile, as this is my very first review.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019d describe Rokka no Yuusha (Braves of the Six Flowers), a fantasy show that\u2019s more than just about swords fighting or saving the world. Well initially, it sets up it like so with its background story. Apparently, it\u2019s revealed that a Demon God existed a long time ago whom annihilated humanity. And now, its return is imminent. Six heroes (or otherwise, known as braves) are chosen by the Goddess of Fate to apparently fight the Demon God. The catch is that there is a fake hero as the story introduces a \u201c7th brave\u201d. Main male protagonist Adelt learns the hard way of what exactly itmeans when suspicion falls upon himself.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the light novels written by Ishio Yamagata, the series takes on an interesting approach at fantasy and adventure. Rather than the group traveling together to fight against enemies and reach the final boss, there\u2019s inner fighting between the heroes themselves. The cause of this is because of the existence of a 7th hero whom the others label as a traitor or double agent. So in essence, the show follows more into a mystery genre as the story progresses. We meet Adelt, the self-proclaimed \u201cstrongest man in the world\u201d in the beginning. Perhaps the cleverest of the heroes and we find out about his past based on his background story. His role in the series becomes prominent because others begins to suspect him as the fake hero. \\n\\n\r\nAs a show with such a colorful cast of characters, we are also introduced to the other heroes. All of them possesses their own unique traits, personalities, and abilities. These include Nashetanya (princess of Piena and Saint of Blades), Fremy Speeddraw (Saint of Gunpowder), Goldolf Auora (Nashetanya\u2019s loyal follower), Chamo Rosso (the Saint of Swamps), Hans Humpty (the mysterious assassin), and Mora Chester (the Saint of Mountains). The show quickly establishes the fact that none of them can be trusted. Unfortunately for Adelt, he becomes a prime target after several implied facts labels him as \u201cthe fake hero.\u201d It sets up a good amount of storytelling as the series immediately shifts into a fantasy/adventure/mystery hybrid. What I also find interesting is how we learn more about the characters including their reasons for being there along with the various hypothesis that focuses on the mystery aspects of the show. Initially, some people might misjudge Rokka no Yuusha and think it\u2019s a typical fantasy story with plain swords fighting. But when it comes to the mystery elements, it\u2019s where each episode begins thrilling enough to anticipate what may happen next. The episodes connects each other in clever ways because of the theories and implied facts. The mystery aspect gets more and more complicated as fingers are being pointed at each other among the seven braves.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are also fairly interesting by individual standards. Fremy Speedraw is the lone wolf with a cold heart and dark past. Labeled by others as a brave killer, she is also a prime suspect in the beginning until Hans begins tearing Adelt\u2019s story apart. One of the most intriguing part of the series is her relationship development with Adelt. It\u2019s hard to say exactly their nature as Adelt trusts her but she doesn\u2019t in return on most parts. As they spend more time together though, some of this begins to change as Fremy wishes to learn more about him. Hans also becomes a character that will catch the audience\u2019s attention. Not only does he seem to be the most mysterious but he is also very intelligent with his deductive thinking. The way he analyzes Adelt shows his wits as a critical thinker. This seems to contrast with characters such as Chamo and Goldov who seems to be only there for their own personal reasons. Chamo doesn\u2019t even seem to care much about who the fake brave because of her childish and perhaps borderline insane personality. Goldov just seems to be there because of his undying loyalty for Nashetanya. Speaking of which, Nashetanya herself is also shrouded by mystery regarding her true alliances and personality. It seems that her personality actually changes depending on who she interacts with. Throughout the series, it\u2019s hard to not also label her as a suspect of the fake seventh brave. Finally, there\u2019s the level headed thinker, Mora. Becomes of her calm personality and age, she is seen in regards as the leader of the braves. Although as time goes on, she displays more of desperation to kill the fake hero. What to say about all these characters? They all seem so different but their common goal is the same: to get rid of the mole and kill the Demon God. The catch is that the show focuses a lot more on discovering the fake hero rather than their collective journey. As a show that present itself this way, it can be a hit or miss for certain fans. Personally, it\u2019s something that I welcome with its refreshing concepts. It inspires theories from the viewers and let ourselves think who may be the fake hero. Additionally, the show does a fairly well job at establishing its world fiction and background history. What may be disappointing is the pacing as the show only adapts the first volume as a 1-cour series. In other words, certain parts of the original story is omitted while we don\u2019t learn a whole lot about our main characters (example: Chamo, Goldov, Mora). Furthermore, the relationship dynamics seems to focus more on Adelt and Fremy than any other character in terms of depth. The others only seems to be there for their own reasons such as Goldov\u2019s loyalty to Nashetanya or Chamo\u2019s respect for Mora. It\u2019s a bit of letdown for anyone who is more curious about the other heroes as their characterization isn\u2019t as strong as Adelt or Fremy.\\n\\n\r\nPassione is a fairly new studio as they\u2019ve only recently worked on Rail Wars, a show that is easily forgettable. Taking that aside, I would say that the artwork aspects of Rokka no Yuusha exceeds expectations. The world fiction is fascinated illustrated with the resourceful mountainous regions. There\u2019s also inspirations that are drawn from the Azetc-like architectures and gorgeous views of the dense forests. Temples are also decorated with high class fantasy characteristics and Kyouma (the monsters that are spawned by the Demon God) heightens the legitimacy of their world\u2019s danger. Furthermore, the character designs of the main characters are all very distinctive with their combat gear, fighting style, and even animal motifs. The action of the show is also very well performed with good amount of cinematic body movements and clever camera angle timings. There\u2019s little fan service although some of the CGI designs of the Kyouma can be distracting at times. But all in all, it\u2019s a fairly well produced show that is hard to forget when its art department is mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is also strong enough to keep up with the rest of the series. The OP theme song has two parts \u2013 the first half gives off a general impression of the show while the second half is more symbolic of the main characters. Some of the ED theme songs are also performed by the characters\u2019 VA themselves, something that I found quite unique. Speaking of which, the character voice mannerisms all are noticeable whether it\u2019s Hans\u2019 cat-like dialects, Fremy\u2019s cold voice tone, or Mora\u2019s commanding presence. The show also does well with its OST particularly when the mystery aspects kicks in with its more eerie coordination. Some of the underwhelming performances will probably be Chamo as her childishness can be borderline annoying or Goldov\u2019s single minded role. Adelt is really also a character that people will find to like or hate just by his personality matched by his voice. But despite that, the soundtrack and voice performances still show of what Rokka no Yuusha is capable of. And that\u2019s definitely not something so easily accomplished in a show like this especially with it being so talky and filled with dialogues.\\n\\n\r\nWhat can be said about Rokka no Yuusha in the end? It\u2019s a fantasy series but not one you will expect to be like from the beginning. Yes, there is still action and magic like the most of the typical stuff fans are used to these days. But unlike others, Rokka no Yuusha adapts with its premise that will hook the viewers into getting into the show more and more. Rather than just watching, it\u2019s also anticipating what the audience will think who the fake hero is as the story progresses. With a good degree of high class fantasy setting and colorful characters, it\u2019s also hard to also ignore those aspects of the show. No, it\u2019s not Dangan Ronpa or Btooom that becomes more of a survival game. Instead, Rokka no Yuusha stands out on its own as not just a fictional fantasy/detective story but also a creative engine with all sorts of matching gears.",

After so many series with the same concepts in the anime industry, this series proved that there is still more quality stories out there. This show is actually great. In fact, the series is certainly different than the others. As I watched this series, I thought, \u201cThis is what I was looking for\u201d.  Frankly, the storyline for this anime is naturally fantastic but I found it acceptable by simply kicking out the logic. That's what we always do anyway. The character design is nice and clean without too many blemishes. Each character's clothing is cute and suits their personalities. This is an aspect that makes the anime worthwhile. I also thought that the realistic hair color of the main character is unique and out of white hair trend. This is a simple fact where they made a right decision because I\u2019ve started to get bored with this kind of trend. Yeah, it looks fantastic at first, but then all characters with white hair become the same characters we\u2019ve seen as any other series. The difference is just they are not from the same series.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter \\n\r\nWhile on the other hand, the characters from this series are more energetic and are generally pleased. At the worst, the character is fairly pleasant and occasionally quite good personalities. I'll never get bored with all of them. For starters, I really love the main lead. Although he is considered stupid and weirdo by each of the characters (not to mention he is the weakest one in terms of powers), he does not let this kind of thing get him. He's simply using all the knowledge that he has learned to ensure the fight is in his grasp. Not too impetuous and stupid for a main character. He uses anything as he sees fit for his advantages for all the fights. If you\u2019re looking for an over powered main lead, you\u2019ve chosen the wrong series. This series is focusing more how he succeeds to go this far using all the experience he has learned. He works really hard to go this far. This is an honorable action for him to take. The atmosphere for each episode gets tense as we are afraid something bad will happen to all of them. This is none other than our affections to see all of them are safe. We\u2019ve taken a liking to them without us even realizing it. The show is also consistent throughout the series that they have not wasted time for idle chat. Even if there is, it's solely for character development. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation\\n\r\nThe art is pleasing in its cuteness.  I would like to say the art and animation is definitely well done and pleasing. As a result, we are treated to a highly quality animated series.\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\nThe music is pleasant in the show. The Op and Eds for the series are quite catchy and very intriguing for us to listen. I watched both Op and Eds to the very end. I loved seeing all the characters perform in those two. They were like dancing for each other and lend itself well to the warm atmosphere. The music in the series provides a cheerful feeling but also some deep emotions. I found it rather sad like something painful is hidden. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall \\n\r\nIn truth, though, I liked the girls, especially Fremy Speeddraw. Initially she is quite harsh and rude, but as the story goes on, I just couldn\u2019t help from falling in love with her. Not to mention she is actually a cute girl right from the start. Her harsh and suspicious attitudes result in more of deep affections. She is probably a special one in a thousand girls. I\u2019m not simply seeking a Tsundere type here, but she is just more than whom you call an attractive person. You will only realize it when you have been struck by her cuteness and completely fawn over her. In all honestly, Fremy unfeeling of emotions doesn\u2019t stop her from being a personal favorite character of mine.\\n\r\nWhile certainly not perfect, Rokka no Yuusha is very fun and enjoyable to watch. It slowly builds up the characterization it is satisfying in the end. I quickly grew to love all the characters. The show is well written and paced. It's a bit depressing when knowing this series has come to an end. Still, I got quite a ride with the series. Give the series a shot because this series has great potential and will hook a lot of fans by no time.\\n",

            "content": "If I told you guys that Rokka no Yuusha was a mystery show and you took a look at this anime at first glance without any background information whatsoever, you\u2019d probably wonder if I was off my pills again. Well maybe I am, but the point is that yes, despite the fact that the setting, characters, and overall driving force are as standard fantasy as they come, Rokka no Yuusha\u2019s plot belongs to the whodunnit side of the genre with plenty of suspects and a lot of circular logic to be had. Which doesn\u2019t exactly change the fact that I\u2019m still watching standard fantasy adaptedby a studio whose last anime was freaking Rail Wars, an anime with so much false advertising attached to it that Burger King advertisements look truthful by comparison. But I do like mysteries, so this standard fantasy was worth taking a look at at the very least. See if this mixing of genres turns out an exciting combination or a generic kitchen sink.\\n\\n\r\nTwelve episodes later and all I can summon for this show is a resounding \u201cmrgh\u201d, which is pretty much a combination of \u201cmeh\u201d and \u201curgh\u201d if you didn\u2019t quite get that. A more common word to describe my judgement would be \u201cmediocre\u201d, which isn\u2019t the worst thing to happen when it comes to the \u201cLN adaptation\u201d field, but you\u2019re reading the wrong guy if you think I\u2019m going to excuse a \u201cbetter than usual\u201d product from a medium whose very form of entertainment runs on poor working conditions and sex crime. Because there was potential for true greatness here with just a little more polish could have made a good mystery anime or even a good character study. Instead, Rokka no Yuusha is pretty much a bad anime made pretentious from its inability to execute its unique ideas properly.\\n\\n\r\nSo the show takes place in some fantasy land where six chosen heroes called Braves must vanquish a great evil called the Demon God, and said Braves are chosen by crests marked on their body from the Goddess of Fate due to their unique abilities. Our focus character is Adlet Myer, a guy who proclaims to be the strongest man in the world and resolves to prove said boast by invading tournaments and wooing ladies whom are more likely to kill him than they are to listen to his big mouth. After said shonen behavior combined with his skillful fighting gets him marked as a chosen hero, he teams up with a bunny girl princess - and I know some people have been praising the Mesopotamian symbolism that was added in by the anime staff, but it\u2019s hard to take anything knee-deep in religious culture seriously when one your characters looks like she\u2019s wearing an extra costume from a Tales game. It\u2019d be like if Haibane Renmei made Reki wear a jockstrap and a beanie the entire runtime.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, he teams up with said princess and meets up with other Braves along the way before they all gather at a temple, only to realize there are seven of them. Naturally, one of them has to be an imposter working undercover in order to sabotage their mission, and when Adlet is suspected due to some circumstantial evidence against his favor, he must avoid the fighting prowess of his comrades whilst figuring out which one of them is trying to set him up. The fact that it takes four episodes to even get to the mystery plotline is one big point against the show\u2019s favor, but whilst things start getting exciting afterwards, the show peters out of energy fast. Whilst I applaud the team\u2019s decision to just adapt a single volume into twelve episodes because they realized that it can only go downhill from there, by the time the finale rolled around, I had long since stopped caring who the imposter actually was because this team doesn\u2019t seem to understand how to make a mystery interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe big elephant in the room is the production. I\u2019m not going to mince words: it is freaking crap, with tons of bad CG and awful cinematography. Even with the studio\u2019s clear lack of money and resources compared to the big wigs, it probably wasn\u2019t in their best interest to hire a director who\u2019s pretty much made a career out of nothing but borderline porn and a LN adaptation that most people consider to be a classic but I consider to be rubbish. There\u2019s this one scene at the end of the fourth episode where the camera tries to build tension by rotating around the room for over a minute Sonic 2006-style to the point that it gave me nausea whilst simultaneously making me want to punch the person who approved that shot in the face. And it also doesn\u2019t help there is quite a bit of fighting in this show, where the few scenes of decent choreography are let down by the lack of in-between animation during moves compounded with horrendously out-of-place CG monsters and magic make them incredibly unexciting to watch. Sometimes, the director shoots the action so close to the camera that I can\u2019t even tell who\u2019s aiming at who or whether someone got hit or not. This is far from the budget issues that plague Ushio and Tora. This is just incompetence that makes Gangsta look like John Wick.\\n\\n\r\nBut no amount of production issues can make me overlook how padded everything is. Once the mystery actually starts, too much of the runtime is spent on the actual deductions and getting from Point A to Point B rather than making said transitions meaty so I'd care about them. Very few of the characters are actually interesting because aside from Adlet and an eye-patched girl named Flamie, we barely get to know them apart from the fact that they come from some fucked-up places and have their own ideologies on how to kill, namely in how fast and cruel they want to do it. There's a little bit of the \"clashing of philosophical conflicts regarding different ways of life\" that made the author's last work, The Book of Bantorra, fun to watch, but it is very neutered here because it mostly manifests in lame action and circular logic that is repeated endlessly doesn't go anywhere rather than something actually challenging. I can't even remember what that knight who protects the princess actually does, let alone his name.\\n\\n\r\nThe development given to the more characterized of the bunch isn't so hot either, because it's mostly just flashbacks regarding racism or idealism that are incredibly hackneyed in execution before resulting in a token romance that is as believable as the scientific study that humans only use 10% of their brain in daily life. And to make it more frustrating, said token romance ends up as nothing more than an \"I hate you. Well I love you\" affair, which is pretty much the third-world country of romance all on its own. However it wasn't the worst thing in the world, so I gave it a pass. And despite the story having no rewatch value whatsoever because there's not much there beyond the actual deductions along with there being no point in watching a mystery again if you know the mystery, I was willing to give the show a \"well it wasn't that bad\" recommendation to people who have lower standards than I do. But then those last few minutes occurred and they ruined everything. Going to be mild spoilers here, but I can't exactly conclude the review without mentioning this, so if you haven't watched this show and take offense to learning anything beyond what's written on the synopsis, I'd advise you to stop reading right now. Also, those who can't handle my hate speeches should probably stay way too.\\n\\n\r\nIf you spend the entire runtime having your characters overcome a challenge, only to rehash that challenge for your sequel-hook ending without so much as a break in-between, all goodwill suddenly disappears when you realize that the authors weren't taking the subject material as seriously as the audience was. It's a cheap method of baiting your audience whilst ensuring that they have nothing to look forward to but the same old shit should they ever make more of it (and I very much doubt they will), and it didn't help that it just put further stakes into the token romance that it quite frankly didn't need. Nothing is more designed to aggravate the mind than substance-less stories with cliffhangers, especially ones that have had absolutely no foreshadowing whatsoever or so little foreshadowing that it doesn't matter either way. And seriously, a freaking cow uniform? You're jealous of a girl in a cow uniform? And cow uniforms are considered suitable fighting clothes in this universe? At least the bunny suit looked mobile, let alone like appealing eye-candy.",

            "content": "Review Anime\r\nRokka no Yuusha\r\nReview Text\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe main plot is pretty simple, with six heroes chosen to defeat a great evil. So why did I give it a 9/10, instead of the 6/10 it \"surely deserves\"? That's because the author decided to add a twist to it: instead of six heroes, he added a seventh. In that case, one among the seven would forcefully be a traitor.The details added to each episode are all meaningful to the end of this series, which explains the slow pace. The slow build-up paid off big time by the series' end. It will keep making you think until the veryend. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nJust like my previous reviews, I won't bother with the art, since it's a very subjective category. However, I should note that the animation is on par with the standards, without CGI, and that the characters look quite different from one to another. I love the old Meso-american-styled clothing and environment though, it's pretty fresh and new. Aside from all of that, the camera angles were absolutely splendid.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nJust like Art, I won't bother, because these two are the most subjective themes ever, though I'll say that the main character's voice actor did a good job at handling the \"cocky\" and confident personality of Adlet Mayer. Fremy's voice actress made a very great portrayal of her character and sounded extremely realistic. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe character section is really the one thing that sets Rokka no Yuusha apart from a \"regular\" anime. Though Adlet looks like a typical shounen character on the first scenes, I'll assure you that he really isn't, following the gathering of heroes, with the tension building up around him. Also, Adlet, as a main character of a supernatural/fantasy anime, surprisingly does not harbour any magic nor superhuman characteristics, despite the magic-imbued/superhuman comrades. In this aspect, he represents the audience and is a character which all of us viewers are able to relate to. The other heroes do well in their own areas, complementing each others and Adlet himself as a character. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nAs I said, I love the old Meso-American civilizations-inspired environment, as it gives off that exotic look to soothe my tired eyes, usually staring at schools, classrooms, cities or wastelands when watching anime. And as I previously mentioned, I love the characters and their respective quirks, along with the tension built around them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nDespite even being a completely truthful adaptation of the original light novel, Rokka's current rating on MAL (7.83/10) is pretty disgustingly low as of today, 20/09/2015 \\n\\n\r\nBoth Rokka's and Mahouka's anime adaptations ROUGHLY HAVE THE SAME RATING (7.83 vs 7.80) \\n\r\nWTF\\n\r\nMAL, ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT WHAT SEPARATES A SHIT-TIER ANIME TO A GOD-TIER ONE IS BUT A MEASLY 0.03/10?!\\n\\n\r\nNotice/Credentials: I read the novel version, so my knowledge on the franchise is rather extensive.\\n",

            "content": "Alright - Having completed this great piece of Anime, I feel it's time for a review.\r\nRight of the bat Rokka no Yuusha approached as solid anime for the Summer 2015 collection with episode 1 already leaving me in the wait for episode two with what was the start of a good story line, art which i found to be nice, music and an overall ambiance that suited well, characters that was lovable. So let's break this into individual segments:\r\n- Story: Great - Not much more to say if you had to give it one word. Great suits Rokka no Yuusha's story as it is inno way original but the way they presented was glorious, and you kind of forgot how \"straight forward\" the story was in the middle all the tension this anime left you with for each episode after the middle segment. All in all the \"uncertainty between peoples when there's one more than it should be\" can seem flat-line, but not when executed like it has been done here. And then ONTOP of this - what that became the whole plot summary for this season, we still got the full story-line behind and in front us of regarding the original objective of the Braves.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for Rokka no Yuusha get's a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\n- Art: Lovely, with all the different types of anime these days - breaking them apart eventually becomes difficult for certain people (Looking away from those who has gone over the edge to make a own special style) and in no way was the art of Rokka no Yuusha MINDBLOWING, but it was not this boring, dimmed down, bad colored type either. The art was just fine and lived up to the atmosphere that the anime gave us, remaining colorful and beautiful while at the same time having this grey stone strike here and there to remind us of the situation our heroes here are trapped within. A work of perfection presented in a decent manner.\\n\\n\r\nArt style: 7/10.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound: Oh the sounds, the music and the general layer of what they put in the background of this anime was part of what made it so great - Making sure that they properly match the music with the scenery (Which sounds weird to point out but they amount of animes I've seen f*** that up is mindblowing) and everything in the background during the slow and silent segments, it all created this passive atmosphere that followed me all the way from the first episode to the last, and it did a great job in doing so.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters: How I loved them all, or well - Most of them. The crew of Rokka no Yuusha was put together in a great manner, it is not each day I see a team of seven people in this style of situation - that either goes along or fight's to death and still manages to maintain their individual characteristic foundation. Rokka no Yuusha delivered more than plenty in terms of characters, making them unique in such individual ways while still not going over the edge while doing so - and at the same time give some of them development traits that in no way damaged the show itself. I was taken away by all seven of them and that for a damn good reason.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s): 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and the overall: If it has not been clear until now - I have absolutely loved this show. So much that it pains me to the bone knowing that the season is already over and that we don't ALREADY have a season two confirmed (As of this entry) scares me. A great anime with some of the better characters I have seen - not only in the year of 2015's anime round up but overall across the different anime's I have had the joy of watching, great art and beautiful music - Rokka no Yuusha is a work of greatness that everyone should see and I absolutely recommend anyone reading this to give this anime a go if you already haven't.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it for my review, fingers crossed for a season two - thank you so much for reading and have a great time watching anime:\\n\\n\r\nTotal score roundup: 8/10.",

            "content": "Expectations are a very powerful thing. After all, whether you like it or not, this world revolves around first impressions. After reading the brief synopsis for the show and taking in the promotional art, I personally thought that this show would be the standard kind of fantasy adventure where a group of friends band together and use the power of their bonds to overcome evil. The first two or so episodes would have you believing that this was the case too. However, after digging through that first layer of information, Rokka no Yuusha reaches a point where it can develop what it wants and whatit wants to develop are the relationships between each individual brave.\\n\\n\r\nFor all intents and purposes each of the braves that were selected by the goddess to kill the demon king are more or less strangers (with a couple of exceptions). Because of this unfamiliarity between one another once the big reveal that a seventh brave has been planted within their group is made known no one really knows who to trust. Adlet, our main character, has been traveling with Princess Nashetanya since the beginning but how much does he actually know about her. Maura is the leader of all the saints but who is to say she does not have her own agenda. This feeling of uncertainty permeates the latter two thirds of the show and creates a great sense of tension that feels natural and keeps the watcher engaged. \\n\\n\r\nInitial suspicions on who the fake brave is falls on Adlet and, without a convincing means of proving his innocence, he escapes into the forest. From this point the show\u2019s pace becomes noticeably slower. While the first three episodes had our heroes all making a long trek to rendezvous at a certain meeting spot the rest of the show takes place within a barrier that cannot be escaped until the seventh is identified. In one regard this kills all of the forward momentum that has been building up and anyone who came to this show with the idea of a grand adventure may be deterred. On the other hand this slower pace is what makes it feel like there is a lot at stake and what lets the writing shine.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a mystery show the writer needs to keep the final reveal a topic of discussion. Subtlety is key. After all, there is no fun in a mystery when the culprit is obvious. Rokka no Yuusha plays around with this by dropping facts that may seem rather arbitrary in the grand scheme of the story only to make you recall that fact when it plays a role in solving the mystery. This attention to detail and care is impressive. Very little was ever done in the show that did not have some bit of importance to the story, no matter how small it may seem. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum things up Rokka no Yuusha surprised me. I was surprised by the sudden change of adventure to mystery. I was surprised by how thought out this show was given the outward look of a typical shounen. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this show. The pacing of the show is a bit spotty and there are a handful of nitpicks I have that I will not go into detail about but I never felt that these factors ever took away from the experience.",

            "content": "This review contains no spoilers.\r\n     Many anime of this season had a gap between its first impression and its actual story. This is one of those anime.\r\n     When I look for anime to watch, I usually look over the covers, and if I like the art or premise, then I move on to read the summary. The cover art for this anime suggests that it is a fantasy action one, with a group of heroes fighting a demon lord. Just a normal fighting anime. However, the actual story was far more complex, and though that made melove the anime even more, some people may have found this disappointing.\\n\r\n     The reason for this anime having a somewhat low rating is, I believe, because all the mystery lovers don't watch this anime while the action lovers do. And neither get what they want. Especially the latter, who saw this anime for some cool fights, and got a mystery and few fighting scenes.\\n\r\n     Another confusing aspect was that the first 2 episodes gave off a \"going to fight the demon lord\" vibe. It got mystery fans uninterested and the action fans excited. It is such a shame, because the story is so good and the characters are interesting, but that aspect was only briefly shown in those episodes.\\n\\n\r\n     So in the end, what I want to say is, all you mystery lovers, go watch this anime. For those of you who like epic action scenes, this anime may not be for you.",

The way the conflict was handled was straight out childish and badly thought out. All the theories being supported by baseless speculation and sircumstance, turning what could have been a more psycological mystery into a basic witchhunt. \r\nAlso you can not have a story where one out of 7 people is a traitor, and also have me care about them. By me knowing that one is a traitor I can't trust what anyone is saying. You never knowif someone is lying or not, or if they have an ulterior motive. This resulted in me feeling uninvested and bored during what was supposed to be emotional scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing I want to bring up is just how pointless it all was. Wasn't this about defeating the Demon Lord or something? The whole anime felt like a sidequest that took up way to much time. Adding to the fact that the ending was incredibly unsatisfying, not only is the story unfinished, but they actually had the balls to pull the same plot twist a second time, right at the last second, meaning that we're almost back where we started.",

            "content": "(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: A thousand years ago the demon god appeared and began to take over the continent however was stopped by the legendary Saint of the Single Flower. After driving the demon god into a deep slumber she foretold that it would awaken again one day and that six heroes bearing her power would rise to defeat it and once again drive it into dormancy. Cycles of these Braves appeared to face the demon god every several hundred years after the Saint's disappearance and were all successful and now the demon god will soon rise again and sotoo must six new heroes. Adlet Mayer (Saito, Soma), the self-professed strongest man in the world, is chosen to become one of these heroes. After congregating with the other Braves it is discovered that they number as seven rather than six and the task of discerning the impostor sets them all at odds as each member grows more suspicious of the other and the demon gods awakening approaches.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Rokka no Yuusha is fairly small as the story is heavily focuses upon Adlet and the six other Braves however this allows for the show to investigate each of the characters to a great extent in the absence of a larger number of characters. Adlet is certainly the character most worth talking about as he stands out distinctly even amongst the other Braves. On the surface is resembles a somewhat typical adventure fantasy protagonist - he is incredibly strong-willed, sincere, and quite ordinary in ability-set in comparison to his fellow Braves. That being said, he is highly perceptive and intelligent in how he fights and problem-solves - both traits lend themselves incredibly well to the story which at a basic level is a mystery. His fighting style is unique and his utilization of traps, crude sciences, and the environment sets him apart from most other characters, especially so from the other Braves most of whom wield powerful magics such as the conjuration and manipulation of swords, gunpowder.\\n\\n\r\nRefreshingly, Adlet is by no means the only intelligent character within the Braves and each member has a strong sense of agency within the plot with perhaps the exception of Goldof. Despite the characters being perceptive and rational, each of them continuously arrive at different opinions concerning the seventh Brave and impostor and what makes them so compelling is that each of their conclusions are legitimized and well-founded. While their character designs are a bit outlandish at first glance they fit well within the aesthetic of the world and I found that I got used to them quite quickly. Rokka no Yuusha is one of the few shows that I can say kept me on my toes as far as which character I put my faith in and trusted as the dynamic of the group and the personality of each character all meshed differently as the plot developed and new information came to light. \\n\\n\r\nThe show takes the time to get to know each character and their reasoning both stays consistent with the characterization presented while also evolving as they do throughout the story which added a strong feeling of consistency to the show's underlying logic. The show is hardly all cold-logic and there are plenty are plenty of emotional characters like Fremy who keep the show engaging in that regard as well. I also can't underplay the uniqueness of each of the Braves in relation to each other as, beyond what they believe, they each come from vastly different walks of life, have distinct mannerisms and speech patterns, and interact with each other in different ways. \\n\\n\r\nThese traits and differences exhibited by each character account for my reasoning that their presence is definitely a strong-point of the show and its focus on character drama and interaction is well founded.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was at first a pretty significant concern for me when the show started out however by the end I was quite happy with how it improved and ultimately handled itself. The initial 3 or 4 episodes suffer a bit from poor character designs and mediocre CG work on the part of the Fiends however after that point the show picks up consistency-wise a great deal - the character designs are far better represented and their animations as well as the movement of the camera become a great deal more smooth and dynamic as opposed to what was initially presented. Baring the first few episodes, the show is strong aesthetically in this area and though it falters at times I would say that animation shouldn't be a concern going in.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that immediately caught my eye that I found interesting all throughout the series was the world and setting established which felt highly influenced by Aztec structures and buildings. It was an aesthetic I had not seen before in anime and Rokka no Yuusha did a great job bringing it to life. The influence present in the setting can also be found in the character designs which accounts for some of their flamboyant appearances however this too I found to be quite interesting and fun after a turn. The vibrant designs of the other Braves further set Adlet apart who's design is more typical and muted both alienating him on an aesthetic and often a cognitive level while also adding a unique flavor and style to the show that I can't claim to have seen elsewhere.\\n\r\nThe show doesn't boast terribly great CG and the Fiends are both bizarre in appearance and execution however luckily we don't see them all that often after the central drama of the story begins and their later appearances in the show are handled slightly better. That being said the poor use of CG was one of my initial concerns with the show but luckily Rokka no Yuusha improved dramatically as time went on and while I would not list the visuals necessarily as a strength of the show, I would say so of the unique designs and aesthetic.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the first 3 or so episodes of the show came up a bit short and the actual premise of the story doesn't arrive until the 4th episode however I wouldn't say that it's plot was terrible beforehand. Rokka no Yuusha doddled a bit before arriving at its premise however once getting to that point it changed dramatically and what I first hard dismissed as a vanilla, demon-killing, action show turned into a mystery-centric, battle of both logic and physical prowess as the Braves clashed with one another. The early episodes also differ noticeably in terms of pacing and the show slows down a great deal for a few episodes midway as it unpacks the logic and implications of the Braves' dilemma however I found this to be far more engaging than what was present prior and the methodical pacing in the mid and latter parts of the show was highly enjoyable. The show does an amazing job juggling suspicion from what character to the next and I, as a viewer, found the way in which Rokka no Yuusha approached the mystery genre to be highly compelling in its presentation of developments and perceived facts.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the strongest point of the story outside of the plot itself was its ability to first evolve into something far more cerebral than what was first laid out but also its ability to maintain the action and adventure feel established early on while evolving immensely elsewhere was impressive. Perhaps even more impressively - it never felt like the latter action was happening for action's-sake but rather it occurred quite naturally within the context of the situation and the intelligence exhibited by the characters and plot felt present within the action sequences as well through their strategic progression and execution. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is quite slow in how it unfolds as it is almost entirely focused upon its premise of there being seven Braves and one impostor and so it may disappoint those who were more interested in the premise in its entirety and its conflict with the demon god and the role of the six heroes. Hopefully the show receives a future installment however the point at which it ends gives a full and pleasurable conclusion to the events at hand, resolving both the mystery and conflict while remaining open.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music was good all throughout and the soundtrack had a handful of  memorable songs. The area where I felt Rokka no Yuusha succeed the most in a musical sense was in how its songs were diverse to the point that they lent themselves well to the heroic, action adventure setting present in the premise of the story while also presenting an apt selection of music to support the show's mystery themes and the many high-tension moments therein. The music matched the tone of the show well in each of it's endeavors and intricacies and was certainly one of the points of success attributing to the show's overall enjoyability. \\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nRokka no Yuusha surprised me, plain and simple. What initially felt like one of the seasonal action shows where stereotypical heroes run around and combat monsters rendered in poor CG rapidly became something extremely engaging and special. It has its fair share of problems such as its lackluster animation and art early on and occasional quality drops throughout however these negative elements pale in comparison to the areas in which the show triumphed. \\n\\n\r\nRating: 8\\n\\n\r\nI gave Rokka no Yuusha an 8 because of its compelling and self-involved cast of characters, its unique aesthetic and combat feel, and the intelligent nature with which it explored its own evolving plot in dynamic and rational ways. The missteps in the art and animation department hinder it from scoring any higher for me and some of the character interactions were not as convincing and well-conceived as others however  the end-product of these things was nothing less than enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who finds themselves classically interested in show's that come off as well-figured, logical, or rational would like the manner in which Rokka no Yuusha plays out as the characters provide compelling reasons for why they think what they do and act accordingly. For the same reason I would recommend it to any purveyor of the mystery genre as it presents an engaging plot in this regard and the manner in which the show allows you to postulate yourself rather than keeping the viewer purposefully in the dark was a strong point of the show. The show has good action and should attract those interested in the more tactical side of combat however those interested in this category will have to find enjoyment in the rest of the show as the fighting intermittently takes a backseat as the show unfolds. To those who look into the show, I do highly suggest reaching at least episodes 4 or 5 before deciding to drop as that is where the show is most transformative.",

            "content": "Rokka no Yuusha, or Rokka: Braves of the Six Flowers, was an anime I watched for two principle reasons: A friend I know who doesn't watch a lot of anime watched it and enjoyed it, and I thought the summary on MyAnimeList looked interesting and unique. I am most definitely a sucker for these kind of shows that play around with the \"group of destined heroes\" concept. Of course, you might not know what if you watched the show and, say, cut it off after 3 episodes.\r\nThe start of Rokka no Yuusha is somewhat deceptive and is more the kind of start you would expectfrom your standard light novel fantasy adventure: A braggart hero interrupting a flashy tournament, a cute and naive princess contrasted with a dark and brooding cool haired girl and, someone pretty obviously set up to be a rival. These episodes aren't bad, but they aren't especially notable when you're starting out, they are the kind of episodes that are actually a lot better to rewatch than to first watch, as they contain a surprising amount of foreshadowing for the series. In many ways, the series can be said to have truly \"started\" in Episode 4, when the series moves from a fantasy adventure piece into a closed room mystery action piece.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there, it gets fairly interesting. I had heard some complaints before that the mystery was \"too obvious\" but while it isn't DEEPEST MYSTERY EVER WHOOOA or anything I thought it was perfectly acceptable. The ultimate suspect is not one I suspected for the most part and the method actually did trip me up from expectations. Given this anime is 12 episodes and only 8 take place in the closed room setting, I found the mystery aspect more than acceptable and actually rather fun. This does bring me to one issue I had: With only 12 episodes and 7 prominent characters, roughly half of which are not introduced until 1/3rd of the series is in the books, some characters pretty clearly fall by the wayside in terms of how much we really get to see of them and their depth or complexity. Adlet and Hans for example get good character examination, while Maura is left rather bare.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, this was a rare show where I would say I did not dislike any characters in it, although most did not stand out to me especially strongly either. Hans was probably the best, you get a pretty good sense of who he is and how he works with some multiple facets without even getting to learn much in the way of backstory or anything. And while it isn't exactly \"character\" in the same sense, Chamot's character was pretty fun and not what I expected in the first place...and the surprise reveal of her power set was actually one of the most memorable parts of the show to me. It is quite a trip.\\n\\n\r\nOne character interaction I felt was somewhat off was the romance part, specifically involving Adlet and Fremy. On Fremy's end it makes sense given her backstory, character and the fact she seems less committed to it, I thought it was less than believable from Adlet's end and stuck out like a bit of a sore thumb. I have heard that the Light Novel has some more explanations for it...but I can't exactly grade the anime for something outside of it and it stuck out to me. The ending is also something that makes sense, I assume it was the same cliffhanger at the end of that Light Novel volume, but in the context of the anime it felt pretty out of place and was one of the parts of the show I more disliked. It felt somewhat cheap and more like it should be at the start of a season two first episode than the end of this show's. And I'm not sure how much I like the direction it is implying it will go to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this show is pretty hit and miss. Stuff like the fight scene in Episode one and some of the exposition after has some really pretty art but at the same time the CGI in this show is generally fairly bad. I don't just mean the monsters, where it seems to be trying to give them an otherworldly quality but fails to do so (compare to the D-Reaper from Digimon Tamers for example despite being a much older show), but another thing they do is these odd panning shots which are painfully and obviously done in CG. They cut down on these with time, but they prominently stood out to me most of the time they happened and not in a good way. Also, the second opening had some slightly jarring parts to me that stood out repeatedly when I watched it. I did for the most part enjoy the character designs a good deal...although I am sad they didn't give Fremy a freaking shirt because I would love the outfit a lot more if it did. Sound is mostly positive with some good voice actors, in fact that's what bumped the Sound to an 8 here, I thought the show actually had some pretty good voice acting, most obviously from Hans, Fremy and Chamot. It had some good ambvient sound and some pretty good songs as well, overall it was pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what's the final verdict? Rokka no Yuusha isn't a masterpiece, that much is certain, but it is a fairly fun and good show. It explores its premise with a reasonable amount and combines it with solid and memorable if at times a bit lacking characters. It combines this with some fun action, leading to a show with an overall \"Good\" quality that nonetheless does not especially stand out. The very end is a bit lacking, but largely coming off the heels of the mystery's wrapping up being done pretty well. If the premise or designs interest you, definitely give it a whirl: It is ultimately pretty enjoyable. If they don't, though, I wouldn't necessarily explicitly seek it out, as it does not do a ton outside of what it advertises.",

That being said, it ends after wrapping up an arc nicely.  \r\nStory is in a 'Werewolf' or 'Mafia' game setting.  Immediately you know you're going to be treated to a lot of analysis, speculation, and lies.  If you like that kind of stuff, you're in for a treat.  \r\nArt:\r\nThe background images are very pretty and character designs are creative.  Combat between humans is clean and enjoyable.  Non-humansare made from invasive CG and it doesn't mesh well.  There are numerous animation errors and lots of still images.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNothing to complain about here.  Music is well placed and enhances the atmosphere.  Sound effects are clean.  Voice acting is well done.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are interesting and refreshing.  They all have well constructed personalities and generally are not limited to a single archetype.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs someone who enjoys twists and well-developed characters, I found this show fantastic.  If you are looking for combat heavy material however, you may be disappointed.  The CG battles can be quite jarring and the art quality might dampen your experience.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you like dialogue heavy shows with lots of twists then this is definitely one for you.

            "content": "Rokka no Yuusha is an anime which you can't really judge from its cover. The synopsis makes it seem like yet another generic fantasy anime about a group of chosen heroes trying to save the world from some evil Demon God, but in reality the story itself is totally different. In fact, Rokka no Yuusha is primarily a detective-style mystery anime about a group of people with a traitor in their midst where they have to use logical reasoning and deduction in order to try to figure out who it is.\r\nIn short, the story is about six \"Braves\" who are chosen by the Goddess ofFate. They're given supernatural powers and tasked with defeating the Demon God who threatens the lands. So they all set out on a journey to do so, but when they finally meet each other, they suddenly find themselves trapped inside a magical barrier... and notice that there are seven people in the room. It is impossible for there to be seven Braves instead of six, and thus they quickly deduce that one of them is a fake and a traitor. But who is it, and how do you prove it? Well, in a nutshell that is more or less what this anime is about.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, the mystery is not much more than a closed room problem, but the scale quickly ramps up and over time there is more and more information revealed about the Braves themselves, the supernatural aspects of the world, certain scientific elements and more. This means that all the clues to the problem are not actually presented in the very beginning, but are rather expanded upon as the show progresses. Because of this, you're left with very little chance to try and solve the problem yourself as a viewer after the mystery is presented, and instead the anime just reveals the solution to you step by step over time. Of course this is nothing more than a different style of writing so there's nothing wrong with doing that per se, but personally I vastly prefer to be given more ability to think for myself when I'm watching a detective mystery, so I was a little bit disappointed by this.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that must be talked about is the pacing. Rokka no Yuusha is an extraordinarily rare case of a light novel adaptation which has an entire season covering just *one* volume of the source material. That's right, 12 episodes for 1 volume. That's about 3-4 times slower pacing than what you'd normally see. This comes with a couple consequences: the good news is that it's extremely detailed and never feels rushed whatsoever, and the bad news is that a lot of time is wasted on matters that feel rather pointless and irrelevant. For example there is a very forced romance subplot going on throughout the anime which really doesn't feel like it adds anything worthwhile to the story at all. There's also the simple truth that the plot doesn't really progress very much with every new episode due to how slow-paced it is. I didn't get the chance to do so myself, but I reckon Rokka no Yuusha ought to be a lot more suited for marathoning than watching weekly.\\n\\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the main character cast consists of the seven (supposed) Braves, including our protagonist Adlet Mayer: the self-proclaimed \"strongest man in the world\". Personally I don't really like him very much because he's extremely arrogant and constantly has to remind the audience of just how strong he is every five minutes, and it gets annoying pretty fast. The other characters aren't given too much backstory or depth simply because they have to remain \"mysterious\" so that they all will seem more or less evenly suspicious. And that's fine and all in theory, but it also renders them rather uninteresting and one-dimensional (at least as far as the viewers ever get to know that is). The most likeable one to me would be the human/kyouma hybrid Fremy, but even she can pretty much be summarized in a few sentences. So Rokka no Yuusha's character cast is fairly uninspiring as a whole, but on the other hand they're all more or less treated as plot devices for the sake of the mystery rather than actual people anyway so I guess that's somewhat understandable.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is not very flashy, but it does its job and fits the tone of the series very well overall. However it's pretty obvious that this is a fairly low-budget anime, as the character designs are oftentimes rendered in very low detail whenever they are in the background of a scene, and the CGI doesn't always look as good as you'd like. But for the most part at least I think it looks fine. The OP and ED themes (it actually has multiple ones) are again nothing spectacular by themselves, but they fit very well with the overall atmosphere of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, Rokka no Yuusha is an anime which is not afraid to break norms, and presents a type of story which is not only unexpected but also a rarity to see in anime. However it also feels a bit like an ambitious experiment that never quite manages to reach up to its own potential. But even though I don't think the anime turned out quite as good as it theoretically could have, it's still a lot better than most, and originality is always a plus in and of itself.\\n\\n\r\nOne final thing that must be taken into consideration though is that for anime-only viewers, Rokka no Yuusha might not turn out to be an entirely satisfactory experience. Like I said before, the anime only covers the very first volume of the light novels and nothing more, so for anyone who doesn't like to read books, you really don't get to see very much of the overall story at all. The initial premise was for the Braves to go out and fight some evil Demon God after all, right? Well that never happens, not even remotely close. Also as far as I've seen, the light novel sales boost from the anime has been rather underwhelming to say the least so I wouldn't put my hopes up for a second season ever being adapted either. However if you try to forget about the story of the world itself and instead focus solely on the detective game, then you can still consider it to be a somewhat conclusive ending. Despite that though, the final seconds leave you with a giant teaser for upcoming arcs, so you might have some trouble turning a blind eye to that part.",

            "content": "Into the Bullshit Fantasy Rabbit Hole: A Rokka: Braves of the SIx Flowers Review\r\nMysteries often work well in the form of a new mystery every episode or just one throughout the course of a feature length film. They are a lot harder to pull off when they\u2019re stretched throughout entire seasons. For me to really look back at mystery and remember it fondly, it needs to keep me entertained and have an extravagant or well thought out conclusion. Rokka: Braves of the Six Flowers did not have that. Instead, it had a litany of problems in terms of explanation and execution, plus a motley crueof characters that left my interest fading in and out.\\n\\n\r\nRokka kinda falls down the bullshit fantasy rabbit hole when it comes to explaining what the fuck is going on. Adlet tries to determine one of the numerous ways that the seventh brave used to trap them in the barrier. Most of the explanations are based around fantasy laws and most of those are quickly shot down by more magical rules. When your reasoning is created from made up things, instead of science and logic, then the conclusion is going to severely lack impact. \u201cWhy was there fog? Oh, because of the fog shrines. But wait! Fog shrines can\u2019t overlap sun shrines, so that doesn\u2019t work!\u201d I\u2019m para-phrasing, but you see what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nNot only are these explanations total nonsense, they\u2019re also a big waste of time! SO much time is wasted from boring exposition that there\u2019s little left to actually enjoy. There are little fight scenes here and there, but they mostly don\u2019t last longer than a couple minutes, which totally sucks because they have the strongest warriors on the planet (or wherever they live) and that would\u2019ve made for some awesome brawls! But I shouldn\u2019t judge something based on what I think it should be, but rather by what it is.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the characters, um\u2026what can I say? They\u2019re underwhelming. They lack personality. And they\u2019re all kinda stupid. Adlet\u2019s stupid because he claims to be the strongest man in the world, then nearly gets killed over and over and over, without beating anyone in the process. Fremy\u2019s hot and has cool gun powers and a fucked up eye, but she\u2019s also a copy-and-paste revenge character. She doesn\u2019t think past her weird plan for revenge, and, well, that\u2019s it. Nothing new to bring to that archetype. Hans is something, and so is Chamot. Don\u2019t really have much else to say about them. Mora turns out to be really stupid and a big, dumb liar that jumps to conclusions. Nashetania\u2019s also attractive, and Goldof is her volunteer bitch slave.\\n\\n\r\nSo, uh, that\u2019s that. A really bland and poorly constructed mystery that takes too long to get to the conclusion. An unsatisfactory conclusion, made possible by a lousy cast and nonsensical explanations.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and as far as the music and animation go? Meh. The animation was okay and the OPs and EDs were not memorable in the least. At least, they didn\u2019t make me want to go to YouTube and listen to them on their own. But that;s just my opinion.",

            "content": "I have seen a lot of valid criticism here that I do agree with and a lot I don't agree with so im going to try and convince you that this show is worth a 10 despite its flaws. Before I get into the review I would like to say that the criticism that this show isn't what it was advertised as is true. This anime does not belong in the mystery genre but more the action genre. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nConsidering the way the anime was set up a story that was anything more than decent wasn't really needed as the story basically only needed toassemble the relevant characters in a certain area and then trap them with the idea that there is a traitor among them. I was pleasantly surprised when the story not only fulfilled this part of the story admirably but also added little parts of world history that were not needed but really created depth. The tales of ancient hero's who walked their path before them and the whole saints concept really created a much more interesting story than I had imagined and I really hope there is more anime set in this world. This said the story is of course not perfect and at times is a bit cliche. My main issue with the story is that instead of having some clever ending to the mystery of the traitor it just sort of involved magic whenever it needed to explain something difficult.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe bar was set high on the first episode with brilliant art, smooth animation and scenes that were an absolute pleasure to watch. This quality wasn't maintained at a constant throughout the anime but the whole thing was none the less a very beautiful anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much stood out here. The music was good, the characters well voiced and the sound effects appropriate. None of it was overly memorable however.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI love good characters and thats what we get here. I found that the characters were refreshingly unique and didn't stray into the anime tropes. There were no harems, the females don't all fall for the main protagonist for no reason, relationships actually do develop instead of remaining stagnant etc.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed seeing the developing relationships between close characters and watching new friendships get formed. I liked the quirky and original personality's of the characters that set them apart and made each one unique. \\n\\n\r\nMost of all I loved the main character who wasn't some overpowered bad ass (despite his claims that he was the strongest man in the world) or some weakling who let others fight for him but a intelligent character who fought using every trick in the book. He never fought fair but used his array of tools and trickery to win the day (or at least try to win it anyway). The main character had the usual issue of being seemingly morally perfect but besides that I found no issues with the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile this anime never lived up to its claim of mystery it did instead contain some of the most enjoyable anime fights I have ever seen. The hero's didn't always win and they didn't recover just from some moral bullshit. Not only was the action exciting but the entire anime was enjoyable to watch due to its great art and interesting story. Really I cant think of a single moment I didn't enjoy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is without a doubt one of my favorite anime ever and as such you should remember that my review comes with just a little bit of bias. Nevertheless I will argue with anyone who puts this anime below a 7.",

            "content": "Approaching Rokka no Yuusha with the expectation of a moderately-average fantasy story will meet you with quite the surprise! For me, the surprise was quite pleasant.\r\nAs far as premise goes, Rokka no Yuusha is your typical heroes hunt down the demon king storyline. It's been done hundreds if not thousands of times before, and the premise itself never really becomes anything notable. However, the unexpected area where this show shines is in its characters! The story almost writes itself with the characters as the focus, rather than preparing for the next plot-event in the \"epic\" storyline. The cast felt very genuine and dynamic and allgrew on me to the point I was almost rooting for all of them. And that bit about \"rooting for all of them\" is what makes the small bit of story we got here actually quite interesting. Minor spoiler-warning...\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime isn't the tale of heroes defeating the a demon king, but the story of the heroes finding each-other and building trust. The plot is of the greatest danger facing those chosen as heroes, being their search for each-other while they're separated and vulnerable. This sets up a \"who-did-it\" scenario which challenges these heroes abilities as-well as reveals truly who they are as people. This is honestly a brilliant way of introducing characters in a story as they show eachother who they truly are. And the story serving the characters isn't all that allows them to be good, the design of this mystery plot-line is handled well enough that surprisingly I really didn't know who it could be at times. In my defense though, the whole mystery relies too heavily on magical lore that isn't laid-out even to the characters beforehand and is nigh deus-ex machina'd along when it's serviceable towards the confusion. However, even with its contrived setup, the story does very fairly distribute its accusations and the characters are for-the-most-part very rational about the situation (except that little girl). Another great thing about the characters is they really are tested and develop in satisfying ways, while also budding a surprising and unexpected romance that felt very genuine and believable.\\n\\n\r\nThere is issues with the show though, being around its weakest link - its visuals. There's a lot of horrible cgi for the creatures of the world, and it really is horrible most of the time. The actual animation also isn't that impressive and lacks a lot of consistency with the characters proportions. The backgrounds also grow quite derivative and unimaginative, basically making most of the world look like a tropical forest. The directing, however, is great (as expected by the man who directed Spice & Wolf). The soundtrack is also fantastic, creating an atmosphere very along the lines of the game \"Shadow of the Colossus\" (the constant horse-rising and Egyptian stone-age theme helping with that). Overall, I really felt the staff created something that felt original in presentation, while not that creative still.\\n\\n\r\nEven with all this praise though, the main thing that holds Rokka no Yuusha back is that it's incomplete and feels a small part of a great journey. If the development of this journey continued to be as ambitious and risky as this segment, I'd have loved to watch more and might've ended it with an even higher score. However, the ending of the anime gave me a feeling the coming story might be more along the lines of the generic demon-king plot, so maybe it's for the best? I'll definitely be reading the novels though to find out.\\n\\n\r\nI usually don't agree with the idea that a show gets better as it goes along and to \"keep watching til it gets good\", but this really is a show you have to put in six episodes to really see what it's about. Even once the main predicament starts, I was convinced it was a brief bit of the anime with an obvious answer to \"who-did-it\". The characters are also introduced in archetypal ways that someone who likes a more rich cast might be instantly turned off, but I assure you there is something to these characters if you give them a shot. Yes they are goofy at times, including their designs, but the characters really have a lot of charm (except for the newcomer at the end who I despised). Give it a shot!",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nIn the house I grew up in, we were always scarce for snacks. Chips, cakes, and cookies were difficult to come by, not because my parents and siblings were allergic or did not like such temptations. No, it was the opposite. Since we all loved them, they barely lasted more than a couple of days after purchasing. One of the delectable treats we usually bought were what are named \u201cGrasshoppers.\u201d Keebler \u2013 the cookie company that uses tiny elf labor \u2013 are the makers, and contrary to their name, they are delicious. They are tiny, aboutthe size of an Oreo, taking up roughly the same diameter as a circle formed when you put the tip of your forefinger onto the tip of your thumb. Their outsides are slightly ridged so that, should you put two together, you could make your own cogged contraption. Most important of all, they have the perfect balance of chocolate and mint, their insides filled not with grasshoppers but with a fudge-filled wafer. Girl Scout Thin Mints are dirt compared to the mighty Grasshopper.\\n\\n\r\nI loved these cookies growing up (I still do), and being the slightly selfish teenager that I was, I would make it my mission to sneak them up to my room during the night to have them all to myself. Sometimes I would confiscate the entire package and hide the remainder that I did not eat in one sitting under my bed, to be consumed at a later date.\\n\\n\r\nThis would come back to bite me because, one day, the Grasshoppers had gone missing and, my family knowing of my theft-like tendencies, immediately accused me. I had not touched this round of cookies, but it was all I could do to persuade them. I tried pinning it on my father, a famous late-night snack-eater. My mother \u201csmelt it and therefore dealt it,\u201d my sister was prone to sneaking food throughout the day, and my brother actually avoided them but we all knew that was the perfect cover-up. By the end of our meal I was still the prime suspect, the cookie culprit never discovered. I remembered this small snapshot of my life after watching Rokka no Yuusha, an anime centering on a potentially false accusation. But instead of about cookies it was about people and instead of a dull dinner it was instead a thrilling ride from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nRokka no Yuusha, at its core, is not a plot-driven anime. An overarching and overdone tale of \u201cgood guys go to defeat the big bad guy\u201d exists and is the underlying motive for the whole group, but the immediacy of achieving it is not present. The anime is not even character-driven. Due to the large size of the cast, little time is available to delve into the past of the people at play. Rokka no Yuusha understands this, therefore placing emphasis on the inverse of plot and characters. That is, the show focuses on everything else, the unknown elements and the mystery of the situation.\\n\\n\r\nTo be clear, a narrative and a set of people are around, but that is not what the anime is technically trying to target. One of the first signs of this seemingly misplaced focus is the dialogue. Rokka no Yuusha is heavy on the speaking, with characters entering monologues, longwinded explanations, and personal epithets. Considering that the majority of the events happen over the course of a day or two, conversations sometimes last hours, the cast exchanging ideas, anecdotes, and theories instead of worrying about the looming threat before them.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the massive amount of talking that goes on, nothing is ever \u201csaid,\u201d no important information is ever gained. Little is learned about the world, characters\u2019 lives are rarely expounded on, and often times the words themselves are incorrect. The dialogue, coincidentally, is fog, cloaking the truth and veiling the answer to the mystery with lies and deceit.\\n\\n\r\nBut it is not all exposition. Truth be told, anime (indeed most narratives) are not keen on having solely dialogue. It can be done but it requires careful planning and the correct context. Thus, shows opt for a rising and falling of action, with Rokka no Yuusha being no different. It breaks up the potential monotony of continuous talking with action-heavy scenes. A brawl against puked up amoebas here, a chase through the foliage there. Action of this magnitude deviates from the norm, drama and tension replacing comfortability and familiarity.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the fights, like the dialogue, do not contain a singular purpose. Their main goal is to once again cloak what should be made clear, heightening the mystery in an indirect manner. When a battle starts, the characters, and by extension the audience, are forced to keep the conundrum on the wayside, subsequently stopping the secrets from surfacing. This red light continues for the duration of the skirmish, at which point the green light is turned back on and everyone \u2013 the characters and the audience \u2013 are permitted to think about the solution. It is an artificial device in the sense that a fight can, and most often does, breakout at convenient moments, but it ultimately feels natural due to the gravity of the problem, the weight of the decisions made, and the force of the actions taken.\\n\\n\r\nThe combination of leveled dialogue and tense action is a roller coaster, the audience riding a sinusoidal wave, the crest a flurry of swords and the trough a detailing of magical wooden stakes. The cycle varies; battles, like their discussion counterpart, ranging in length from a quick knife throw to a prolonged feud. Sometimes the wave stands, with sentences becoming spears to insult or insinuate another and vice versa. But what happens during the middle section from high to low or low to high? Those transitional sections are as important as the exposition and battles, with \u201ctransition\u201d the operative word: a transition in character focus. In other words, the anime mixes up the cast, providing appropriate screen-time for the people involved.\\n\\n\r\nIt is important to understand the allocation of screen-time varies and is not uniform, with the frequency of appearance different for each person. Visualizing a spectrum, Adlet, the star, occupies the top and Goldof, with nothing to his name but a crush, occupies the bottom, with everyone else in-between. Seemingly tangential, the screen-time of the characters finds relevancy precisely because it differs from person to person. Had everyone acquired similar time onscreen, such an aspect could be discounted, however since everyone had dissimilar time onscreen, it becomes yet another factor that needs to be taken into consideration when investigating the mystery.\\n\\n\r\nIs it Hans, who was absent in the beginning but had a large presence in the middle of the season? Is it Flamie, who would switch in and out with the other Braves? Or is it really Adlet, whose massive amount compared to everyone else was meant to impose a false sense of security? Arguably it had to end up this way \u2013 the size of the cast demands that some characters will inevitably gain more screen-time than others. But Rokka no Yuusha uses this inevitable detriment to its advantage, propagating the mystery that much further.\\n\\n\r\nThe mystery is evidently and thoroughly supported \u2013 it is a motif that finds strength in nearly all aspects of the anime. But the thematic presence is equally as important, with the themes emerging from the mysteriousness of it all. A simple view would be that an action should not be undertaken until all possible angles are taken into consideration. The viewer sees firsthand how assumptions lead to infighting and incorrect conclusions when Adlet is blamed for everything unfairly before all outlets are explored, meaning that the mystery showcases a perfect example of what not to do in a similar situation. A better view builds off the previous: people are sometimes wrong.\\n\\n\r\nPeople make mistakes, people are not infallible. Doubly so if the issue at hand is inherently mysterious. It is common for people to think critically about a problem, and even after considering every angle, he or she might still be wrong. Flamie, Hans, and Maura succumb to this reality when they admit their erroneous attacks. Interestingly, Adlet, the self-proclaimed \u201cstrongest man in the world,\u201d encounters this notion as well, where his conjectures often led to dead ends. Granted this situation is direr than normal, with individual mistakes potentially ending in the loss of life, meaning it does not directly correlate to the real world. However it is still a nice guide for this type of thinking since it demonstrates why these mistakes happen and what these mistakes create.\\n\\n\r\nThe best view, though, is Rokka no Yuusha\u2019s forte: the inverse. That is, people are sometimes right. It is surprisingly difficult to place trust in another person, believing what he or she has to say without reservation. Such difficulty arises from the inability to get inside the head of another person \u2013 an angle from another\u2019s perspective is impossible \u2013 and from the inability to accept being wrong \u2013 people hate making mistakes. Together it means having less faith in others.\\n\\n\r\nBut sometimes that leap of faith has to be taken, gambling on the fact that the mysterious cloud that surrounds people is not always malicious. Adlet\u2019s actions demonstrate this kind of willingness to find the good in others, with him aiding his comrades, falling in love, and protecting those close to him. The others do the same: Flamie starts to trust, Hans makes a friend, and Maura acts motherly. They all place themselves in danger by doing so, but the reward of tighter relationships and stronger answers proves taking that chance is no mystery whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Rokka no Yuusha purposefully avoids the meat of its narrative and its characters in favor of everything else around it, the mystery it manifests and the themes it touts contain more than enough sustenance all their own.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Rokka no Yuusha is does not change much. To be fair, it has a nice amount of variety in the beginning of the season, where Adlet visits the Aztec-esque town and where he travels the countryside with Nashetania, visiting plains, sunsets, and mountains. It is when the real journey starts that the locations and subsequently the backgrounds start to stagnate. In essence, there are two areas: the ritual tower and the rest of the jungle. Again, to be fair, there is no way around this considering the dilemma. But this is not just passable plot-wise but also thematically relevant. The tower is a hub, a metaphorical \u201csafe haven\u201d amidst the chaos around them. Its stark blue interior also contrasts heavily with the green of the jungle, giving it a larger feeling of safety. The fog is a concealer, hiding actions, persons, and areas, increasing the overall mysteriousness. And the jungle achieves this effect as well. A jungle blends together, with one spot pretty much the same as any other. It can start to get confusing, disorienting those trapped within it; the perfect place for a mystery. That is to say, the art, like the story, uses inversion \u2013 one or two locations are not boring but purposeful \u2013 to increase the total amount of mystery. In short, the anime continues to use its own predefined limitations to its advantage.\\n\\n\r\nSadly not every limit can be overcome. One of the show\u2019s biggest grievances is the CG it employs. Simply put, it is awful. The Fiends \u2013 the natural enemy of the humans \u2013 are ugly, in both design and depiction. The former done purposefully to make them the ravenous beasts that they are and the latter done accidentally because otherwise it would make little sense. They stand out horribly in the world, their movements are choppy, and they look blocky rather than menacing. Flamie\u2019s bullet magic and Nashetania\u2019s swords use CG as well, however those instances are tolerable. For the Fiends, they are a blight, in the positive and the negative sense.\\n\\n\r\nAll positive are the character designs. In fact, the character designs are arguably the anime\u2019s strongest facet. On the surface level, they are imaginative \u2013 a flurry of colors, a myriad of outfits, and a stampede of accessories donning each person accordingly. Going deeper reveals how the characters\u2019 designs follow the mystery motif. It might be something simple like Hans\u2019 hair covering his eyes. It might be something more complex like Chamot\u2019s androgynous and childlike persona. Or it might be something esoteric like Nashetania\u2019s mirroring set of colors, the white signifying purity and goodness and the red signifying evil and hate. At the deepest level, their designs correspond with their personalities and development throughout the season. Flamie wears a flower on her cap, symbolizing the growth and flowering she undergoes whereas Goldof\u2019s helmet represents his hardheadedness, his loyalty, and his delusions. They are an amazing example of what thoughtful character designs are capable of.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation is unfortunately not amazing, instead a wishy-washy offering. At times, the action can pick up, with characters running, jumping, and falling throughout their battles. Choreography of the fights is standard, relying more on flashy maneuvers than direct impacts. Interestingly, Adlet\u2019s fighting style allows the anime to avoidanimating, with his use of smokes and screens to evade and bamboozle his enemies. It is a clever trick, both literally and figuratively. Mostly, though, the show tends to lean on minimum animation due to the huge amount of dialogue that is exchanged and thus is subpar in this specific category.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate, Rokka no Yuusha is technically not character-driven but that does not stop the anime from continuing its upward spiral.\\n\\n\r\nA correlation between the screen-time per cast member and the extent to which they are expounded can be established, with Adlet once again receiving the most attention and Goldof receiving the least. Even so, Adlet\u2019s history is not wholly elaborated; the audience is shown his home village and small snippets of his training, but it is not enough to say that the viewer knows Adlet as a person. In other words, since little is known about Adlet \u2013 the star of the show and the one at the top of the spectrum \u2013 logic dictates that even less is known about everyone else. This is true: Flamie is a half-human, half-fiend with mommy-issues, Nashetania is a princess, Hans is a catlike thief, Maura is the Saint of Mountains, Chamot is practically Maura\u2019s child, and Goldof listens to nobody but Nashetania. Hyperboles, but almost nothing else is given about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt is hard to say whether or not Rokka no Yuusha deters from showing much about its characters because it has to or because it wants to. The former is enticing since it is a natural byproduct of the structure of the cast. Its size, its diversity, and its need to center on Adlet would make it seem obvious that the majority of the characters would earn little focus. The latter, however, is not that farfetched due to the anime\u2019s distinct pattern of refraining from detailing key information about the characters. Flamie\u2019s origins and her mother are never shown despite her talking about them and being a large influence on her. The anime chose not to depict Hans, Maura, and Chamot\u2019s trek to the tower, instead focusing on Adlet and his route, and in the process reducing explanations on the previous three. Goldof is no different, whose outing before meeting up with Nashetania is only described in words. Nashetania as well, her only non-Brave dealings occurring as a personal aside with Adlet very early on and minute conversations at a campsite. The pattern is an inversion \u2013 instead of the cast not having much about them because it was impossible to include it was done purposefully.\\n\\n\r\nThe legitimacy of this pattern is concerning, but not when it aligns with each of the other topics. The story uses inversion and the art uses inversion, so it is feasible to assume that the characters would use inversion as well. More profound is, like the story and the art, the inversion is another means to increase its mystery motif. A character is mysterious when his or her past is unknown, and since almost everyone\u2019s past is, the mysteriousness ramps up further.\\n\\n\r\nMystery persists in the characters, so thematically something is going on with them. The cast is saying something without really saying it. That message: \u201cdo not judge a book by its cover.\u201d Just because someone looks a certain way, acts a certain way, or comes from a certain background does not immediately make that person a stranger or a weirdo. Of course, this may be the case \u2013 Flamie fits this description to a degree, as does Hans. But it is like the story\u2019s theme on people sometimes being right; sometimes, that person is not who they are perceived as being. The half-fiend is more human than anyone in the group. The sarcastic assassin is incredibly friendly. The small child is undeniably powerful. The leader-like lady is arrogant and stubborn. The guard dog is devoted yet extremely narrow-minded. The sexy, harmless royalty is the mastermind controlling the strings. The scrawny, slow, and smiling scientist is \u201cthe strongest man in the world.\u201d The whole cast exemplifies the idea that a precursory glance of a person is not enough. It is unfair to judge someone based on their outer, public qualities when their inner, private ones reveal infinitely more about who that person happens to be.\\n\\n\r\nThat is to say, the biggest mystery in Rokka no Yuusha are the characters themselves.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe main opening theme continues the mystery, with the start of the track an ominous set of tones. It morphs into hard guitar and hard note shifts to increase the foreboding sense. All the while the vocalist is working overtime alongside the drummer. The piece ends how it started, with a trailing tone that is simultaneously chilling and creepy. As for the main ending theme, it oozes regret at the start with the singer\u2019s slow singing. However the piece gradually picks up in tempo and spirits, finishing happy where it began sad. Its visuals reveal the meaning: it is a piece symbolizing Adlet\u2019s life. The track itself is strong but seemingly has no place among the mystery it touts.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, until the other OPs and EDs that Rokka no Yuusha incorporates into the mix are investigated. \u201cCry for the Truth\u201d is adventurous, \u201cDance in the Fake\u201d is, like Adlet, Nashetania\u2019s piece and almost horror-sounding (relevant as more is discovered), and \u201cNameless Heart\u201d is, like Adlet and Nashetania, Flamie\u2019s piece and filled with longing and melancholy. These tracks as well fail to follow the mystery motif, instead aiming for separate emotions altogether. Remarkably, like the story, the art, and the characters, this is a type of inversion once more \u2013 not focusing on mystery actually gains more of it. To put it differently, switching between different OPs and EDs, each with various feelings and vibes, causes disarray, leading to convolution and therefore more mystery. Inversion is a technique the anime used throughout its other elements, so it being here as well is simply intelligent.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of the soundtrack is heavy on the violin, multiple different arrangements unified with other instruments to achieve the right effect of drama or tenseness. The byproduct per usual is an increase in mystery. Pianos and harps fill the rest of the gaps to accentuate the more depressing and more uplifting moments, offsetting the mysteriousness and thus accentuating it, too. So while many of the pieces lack strength or memorability, some at least find themselves fitting within the themes of the show.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, voice acting sees above average performances across the board. Soma Saito as Adlet does well, giving Adlet a young yet mature voice that fits his mantras and passions well. Aoi Yuuki as Flamie hits the bullseye with her quiet voice, one filled with misunderstanding and pain, a perfect match for the broken woman. And Kenichi Suzumura as Hans nails the \u201cNyaa!\u201d each time Hans opened his mouth, crafting Hans into the playful guy that he is. Together, the voice actors and actresses fit their respective roles nicely, thereby improving the overall execution of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nRemember those Grasshopper cookies? It turned out that there was no culprit, there was nobody to blame. The cookies were mistakenly misplaced in a cupboard, hidden away to prevent me from finding them in the first place. The cookie culprit did not exist to begin with. But those twenty or so minutes, where me, my parents, and my siblings were flinging accusations and fighting arguments felt real. It was an interrogation of familial proportions, with each of us throwing one another under the bus to escape scrutiny.\\n\\n\r\nThat is what this anime does so well, capturing the whodunit atmosphere nearly perfectly. It got me involved, shouting at my screen \u201cYea, screw him!\u201d or \u201cDo not believe her lies!\u201d because I cared about certain characters, believing in them and their words just as I believed in myself and my convictions with those cookies. I was double-guessing, crafting theories, and collecting evidence, all in an attempt to out the seventh Brave, as a sort of redemption for how I failed those many years ago.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it was fun. I tensed up when Maura was ganging up on Adlet with everyone else, I was pumping my fist when Flamie opened herself up gradually, and I was smiling right along with Adlet each and every time he called himself the \u201cstrongest man in the world.\u201d I audibly laughed when Adlet kicked Nashetania square in the face, because I knew that that bunny bimbo had it coming to her. Watching Flamie blush because she was having trouble processing her own feelings was wonderful to see as well. But my favorite part was Adlet\u2019s tiny speech near the end, because it is true: no other man but he could have done the impossible. Each episode had these small moments of triumph and turmoil that made the mystery not just something the cast was experiencing but I and the rest of the anime community were experiencing, too.\\n\\n\r\nWith Braves, Fiends, and Saints, Rokka no Yuusha leaves its mark. An interesting story, an intriguing bunch of characters, and an immersing set of sounds lay the groundwork for the show, but it is its ability to reach out and grab the audience, making them a part of the tale, that makes the anime as powerful as it is. And like a Grasshopper cookie, it is definitely worth a bite or two.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, exposition, intermittent action, and uneven character screen-time add up to a high amount of mystery, with its theme on trusting others growing from said mystery\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, purposeful art makes more mystery, subpar CG, fantastic character designs, and below average to average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, while the cast is expounded on minimally, this increases the mystery levels once more while also providing a nice theme of \u201cdo not judge a book by its cover\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, a helping of good OPs and EDs that continue to increase the mystery motif, with an okay OST, and above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, the whodunit atmosphere, the smaller scenes, and the ability to rope the audience in make it not just an anime but an entire experience\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "Rokka no Yuusha is an anime based on a series of light novels by Yamagata Ishio. The light novels are still going too. There's also an ongoing manga based on the novels. So, in 2015 there was an anime version from Passione, a studio that also did Rail Wars & Haitai Nanafa, which I haven't seen, and nothing else. They haven't exactly been the most prolific of studios, but maybe that doesn't mean much. They haven't exactly been around for that long. And their few projects could be really good. So, let this serve as my introduction to them as I delve into Rokka noYuusha.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nWe open with our main protagonist, Adlet, interrupting an exhibition match while declaring himself \u201cthe strongest man.\u201d Get used to that line, it gets repeated a lot. Turns out that Adlet really wants to be one of the Braves, six chosen warriors who are destined to fight the demon king. His little stunt lands him in a dungeon and, after spending a long time within, he has a strange dream and wakes up with the Brave's Crest on his hand. He shouts out that he's been chosen and gets rescued by Princess Nashetania, who has a Brave's crest on her upper chest, just below the neck. Which I'm sure is not a design choice to excuse her exposing her cleavage. The two run off to meet with the other Braves.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest fault with the series is that it starts out slow, looking very much like a typical fantasy story. When the series is a third of the way through they introduce a locked room mystery surrounding a seventh Brave where Adlet and his companions are trapped and have to find out who among them is an enemy. At that point, it actually does get interesting. The ending also does drop the ball a bit by promising that the continuation will regurgitate a major plot point from this series. Which could easily become repetitive unless Yamagata is very careful.\\n\\n\r\nIn all fairness to the slow start, it is kind of necessary in this case. The series enhances its mystery by setting up the viewer's expectations for a very typical type of story, including having characters who look pretty readily suspicious, only to subvert those expectations as the series heads towards its climax. I will give the series credit, it is done in quite the clever way. I'll also give it credit for being excellent at foreshadowing. There are several events that appear to be just part of the world building or ordinary character moments that are actually important when the climax comes around and the series is good about treating them the same way they do the world building and regular character moments. Which results in a climax that's not telegraphed but has a good amount building up to it. I also will give the ending credit. It does stop at a good point with the promise of more challenges but with a huge one out of the way. It also does craft a sense of paranoia quite well with the seven characters being trapped together, not knowing which one is their enemy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nLike the narrative, the characters are initially set up to look very typical but, as the series progresses, they start demonstrating facets that go beyond the archetypes that you'd associate with them on that basis. At least, most of them do. There are some who are a bit under-developed. Which isn't particularly surprising, given that there are seven major characters in this and twelve episodes. If there's a follow up series, maybe those characters will get more to them. And I will give the series credit that even the more under-developed characters get something that advances them above the usual archetype. Even if it isn't much. About the biggest issue is that the main romance feels a bit forced. Maybe the story develops it better in the stuff that takes place after this, but it starts really abruptly.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nTake a wild guess at what my major issue with the art in this is. If you're familiar with my reviews, you can probably guess it easily since it's probably the complaint I have about art most frequently. Yes, this series has a bit of an issue with fan-service, giving several characters ridiculous outfits. Whether its Fremy's tiny strip of cloth covering her breasts while her stomach is fully exposed, Nashetania's fetishy bunny girl thing or Goldov's muscular stomach being shown in much the same way as Fremy's outfit, including a tiny strip of cloth covering his chest. So, at least its equal opportunity fan-service. On the positive side, the backgrounds in this are very well detailed. The monster design is superb. These things just look really cool. The action sequences are also nicely done, with smooth, quick action that can be really intense.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting in this is well done. Saito Soma, Yuuki Aoi, Hikasa Yoko & Suzumura Kenihi all give strong performances and there aren't any weak ones. The music is good. It was done by Oshima Michiru, who also worked on the music for Fullmetal Alchemist.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't any.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nSo, that's Rokka no Yuusha. As a whole, I really liked it. The subversive aspects work well. There are some strong characters. Ridiculous outfit design aside, the artwork is strong. It has really good acting and music. There are some things that could have been done better, but nothing too substantial. I'm actually really interested in the possibility of a sequel, just because a lot of the establishing stuff is out of the way and it could dedicate more time to fleshing out those aspects. That being said, my rating for this one is a solid 8/10. Next week I'll look at Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin. Until then, take care.",

Wait what?\r\nDon't get me wrong, I LOVE it, but it just didn't feel right not to start the review this way.\r\nAdlet Mayer is the \"strongest man in the world!\" as he-self proclaims 55 times (counted), and along with five other heroes he must defeat the evil demon lord that rises every 300 years or so. My bad, I meant with the other six heroes. No, no wait... I meant seven... EIGHT? What the hell?!\r\nWell, basically what gives the false first impression of a classical fantasy anime focused onheroes fighting demons, quickly (ep 3+) turns into a detective game. Instead of 6 heroes gathering, 7(+) have appeared, and one of them is a fake working for the demons, that has trapped everyone, including him/herself, in a mist barrier. If the fake dies the barrier will disappear and the heroes set free to continue their journey. Aaaaaand barely 10 minutes after they discover this the heroes start blaming each other and looking for excuses to kill. \\n\\n\r\nExcellent animation (some people complained but honestly I don't get it, I loved it from start to end), amazing voice acting, a very intimidating story that keeps you guessing until the very end (and actually after the end) and extremely good character development are bound to leave you craving for more.\\n\\n\r\nFROM THIS POINT ON SPOILERS:\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-The protagonist's fighting style is what you would actually expect from an episodic villain in shounens, kudos engineering.\\n\r\n-First time ever in anime history when the rogue/assassin character KICKS ASS.\\n\r\n-The typical anime female overenthusiastic female lead material gets the shaft and instead the protagonist goes for the emotionless loli route. Kudos. \\n\r\n-Flemie's voice acting when she cracks down in the final episodes. Oscar-worthy, will at the very least make your eyes moisten.\\n\r\n-Everyone, EVERYONE is well written.\\n\r\n-Excellent animation.\\n\r\n-The hate is real for Nachetanya.\\n\\n\r\nKons:\\n\r\n-I could really do without Flemie turning slightly tsundere in the end.\\n\r\n-The f@cking cow in the final episode. Epitome of bad character design.\\n\r\n-The bromance between Adlet and Hans was fun but in the end it started turning a bit gay.\\n\r\n-Quite a few wasted comedy moments here and there (for example when Adlet wakes up to find Maura above him instead of Flemie).\\n\r\n-So the main problem was that noone clicked the right texture in the point&click section of searching the temple? Come on! That's just disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I think about it all my Kons are from the final episode... Heh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Definitely worth your time!",

            "content": "The genre of mystery in anime seems to be a source that is untapped and scarcely utilized. Unfortunately, it seems to be for a good reason. Making a mystery that is well-written requires a lot of forethought, consideration of plot holes, and a compelling set of characters, hence why writing for the genre is difficult. In anime especially, which is undeniably conformist to its own tropes and studio-distinct styles, mystery is an element that has yet to be articulated in a graceful, intelligent manner all the way through. Rokka no Yuusha makes attempts at crafting a good 'who done it?' series, but ultimately fails atcreating anything of substance. \\n\\n\r\nWhat begins as an adventure story that is about to embark slowly comes to a close as a dull, slow-paced guessing game to pinpoint who among the seven heroes is the traitorous fake. The biggest problem that Rokka no Yuusha has, in regards to this development, is that there is barely any real mystery behind it. It is not well-crafted nor is it thought-provoking. The issue doesn't lie with the idea, but rather with the way that the idea was conceptualized and presented. Although most of the series is supposed to be some sort of mystery, you can easily narrow down your choices of who the traitor is whilst being only halfway through the series. The build up of the mystery simply never reaches a high enough peak for the reveal to create any impact upon the final reveal. When the mystery concludes it is expectantly very lackluster. To top everything off, the ending cliffhanger is eye-roll inducing and outright distasteful. I barely could sit through these twelve episodes, and I sure as hell would not sit through another twelve that follows the same ludicrous scenario. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Rokka no Yuusha are very plain, which adds to the reason of why the series can't sell itself as a decent mystery series. Every character is distinct, but also very stale. The only character that I could even come close to liking was Adlet. Adlet, when keeping his delusional strongest man in the world spiel to himself, is somewhat of a refreshing character in the sense that he's not especially overpowered just for being the main protagonist. As a jack of all trades, Adlet uses knowledge, tools, and tricks to cover his lack of gifted ability. Compared to the other braves, whose powers all seem to come right out of their asses, he's at least interesting. The rest of the characters lack development and feel extremely shallow. Most of the interaction(s) between the braves feel hammy and very silly overall. For a 'who done it' series, which is dependent on its characters, Rokka no Yuusha only manages to gather a mundane bunch.\\n\\n\r\nPassione, a new studio with only a couple other works behind its name, unfortunately does not provide any stellar results in the visual department to help offset the series' lacking content. I am typically not a fan of 3D animation being mixed with 2D; it usually looks terrible, in my opinion. Nashetania's blades looking like plastic toys, the sluggish looking/moving demons, and Maura's power being a bunch of flying yellow squares are disappointing to look at, to say the least. There are also many instances where characters look very poorly drawn.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio pieces of the series don't stand out to me personally, though the ED was fairly decent. Nothing in the actual soundtrack particularly caught my attention.\\n\\n\r\nRokka no Yuusha aligns itself perfectly with mediocrity, leaving more to be desired but not finding any means to satisfy it. The anime isn't bad enough to actually be labeled as bad, but not nearly good enough to be classified as anywhere above average.",

            "content": "Honestly, I had high hopes for this anime after watching an advertisement for it. But a few episodes in, the enjoyment I had while waiting for what was going to happen next disappeared. \r\nSTORY\r\nThe biggest issue for me was that the plot changed, it seems like the producer went off topic.I did not read the original material so I don't know if this is based off what the author wrote or if the producer just made a mistake. Either way, it ruined the show immensly for me. The show was supposed to be about the \"Heroes of the SIX Flowers\" going to defeat the risingDemon God, yes? But somewhere along the way, the fact that people are dying just seems to slip their minds and the biggest issue becomes that there are SEVEN \"Heroes of the SIX Flowers\" instead. Seriously, what? Why does it matter if their is an imposter? Especially since it says near the beginning that only demons and the Heros of the SIX Flowers could enter the Land of Howling Wind (I don't remember if this is the correct name or not), so if there is an imposter they'll die anyways. \\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND\\n\r\nThe art is mainly what drew me to watch this anime. The animations were great. Sometimes the background music did not match what was going on, but overall it was okay.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nI personally like the character variety a lot. Each character has their own stories, some kind of motivation to defeat the Demon King. They don't share the same personalities, each character is unique. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI actually did enjoy this anime, it's just that the fact that they dropped their mission to find an imposter was very annoying. If they had just ignored the fact that there happens to be an extra then I would have enjoyed this much more. But I guess it wasn't that bad.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nIt's a good show but I wouldn't watch it again. I would recommend this to mystery fans, since that's what this turns out to be.",

The first few episodes run a bit slow, but things soon heat up like Misa-misa at the sight of Yagami Light. The main conflict focuses on psychological tension, though there's a fairbit of action too and the fights were well-orchestrated and original, and played a key part in both plot and character development. The plot curlicues (yes, I used that as a verb) in unexpected directions, making for a couple of twists that would have taken L himself by surprise. I have some reservations about the characters - some I kind of liked, some not so much, but, most importantly, I found a few's motives to be unconvincing. Also that \"The World's Strongest Man\" thing really annoyed me - the explanation was kind of trite, too. Finally, the ending seemed a bit contrived to me - the mechanical part (how the villain did what he/she did) was okay, but his/her motive remained unclear and what followed (I did say spoiler-free) had me rolling my eyes. \\n\\n\r\nRecommended for: People looking for a mystery with plenty of unexpected plot twists and quirky characters.\\n\\n\r\nNot recommended for: People looking for an action-oriented Naruto-style anime.\\n\\n\r\nP.

            "content": "I'm going to keep this short and sweet: Rokka no Yuusha is not what it appears to be. In the first episode, it comes off as a adventure fantasy story about a very self-centered man by the name of Adley Mayer, but the anime actually turns out to be an unexpected and well done drama mystery more than anything else. Coming in, I expected a mediocre action anime that would end up being as bad as I thought it would be but instead I found it to be a fresh work that I hadn't enjoyed as much as anything else in a while. The storyends up being very interesting and engaging and the only flaw with it that I can remember is that it hinted at another season when there has yet to be any official word at one, but here's hoping. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a couple of CGI bits which look much worse than had they been drawn, although I suppose there might not have been a budget for it, but the CGI that was used was very out of place in my opinion. Most of the hand drawn works and the backgrounds felt good, I don't recall any quality tier animation either. \\n\\n\r\nI had no issues with the sound, I liked the score that it had but it wasn't anything too outstanding. Opening had a cool as fuck song, though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were solid, I don't think any of them had any major issues, although I didn't like what they did with Fremy much. The characters all had interesting backgrounds (those that had them, that is) and designs and overall I feel like they did a good job with them.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, I really enjoyed myself with this little gem. It's nothing too amazing but it's definitely worth a watch if you like mystery, fantasy, or drama.",

            "content": "Okay, now this was a really good show. And I mean REALLY good. Not objectively flawless, but tremendously enjoyable and definitely addictive.\r\nIt starts off as more of an action series, with the main mystery only really being introduced around a third of the way through. Although the series does change tone quite a lot once the mystery is introduced, if you liked the beginning few episodes chances are you\u2019ll like the rest. On the other hand, if you didn\u2019t like the first few episodes, give it a few more \u2013 up till about ep 6 - before deciding one way or the other. Youmight be surprised.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting was really unusual, what with the Aztec theme and everything. It gave a unique feel to the show, and was altogether a nice change. There wasn\u2019t much world building that wasn\u2019t directly related to the Braves. I wouldn\u2019t have minded a bit more exposition, but it could easily have just become useless filler, so I\u2019m basically glad they stuck to the parts they did.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst the story had some generic elements to it, there were a few twists that gave it more depth \u2013 the idea of the recurring 6 braves, the saints, the fiend culture and their relationship with humans. The whole way magic was portrayed in this show was unique and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were probably one of my favourite parts of this anime. The MC, Adlet, was exactly the type of character I can\u2019t stand in most anime. However here I thought he was brilliant. His characteristics were just done right. Appropriate backstory, and only brought in when necessary. His backstory actually added a lot, explained his character, and was quite interesting. it didn\u2019t feel like filler when brought in. He was also a character who was consistent in his personality traits, but mature enough to recognise his faults and overcome them. Above all, he wasn\u2019t a hypocrite. He practiced what he preached, and I think that\u2019s why I liked him so much, despite being fed up of hearing the words \u2018strongest man in the world\u2019 which he seemed to use every time he spoke.\\n\\n\r\nFremy was also an excellent character. Her development was lovely to watch, and quite emotional at times too. Her backstory was fascinating, and, like Adlet\u2019s, brought in at exactly the right time. I actually didn\u2019t like her much initially, but by the end of the series she had completely won me over.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the other major characters were developed decently. Hans\u2019 character in particular was fascinating, and I looked forward to every time he came on screen. Nachetanya and Mora could have done with a bit more time spent on their backstories, but the only one who really needed some more depth to them was Goldov. He was the only one dimensional brave, and as a result the only one I couldn\u2019t have cared less about throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe mystery next. Some might call it slow paced, but I think the pacing was perfect. Each part of the mystery is explained in enough depth for the viewer to understand, but without going into every little detail. The anime managed to keep the suspense up throughout \u2013 you really are guessing who the 7th is right until the end. And it doesn\u2019t contradict itself either, there are a lot of little hints hidden along the way but you can only put them together one you have enough info to understand what they meant in hindsight. It\u2019s clever. I do think that at one point very near the end there was just a little too much coincidence at play, it was more like the screenwriters said \u2018Oh hey! We\u2019re nearly finished, and they haven\u2019t got anywhere near close to solving it yet! Let\u2019s just give the characters an epiphany!\u2019 That part needed to have been drawn out more, although not at the expense of any of the other scenes. The anime really needed more than 12 episodes to get everything in properly.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and animation, they were great. Lots of vibrant colours, which then darkened as the mood became grimmer. The way the op changed throughout the series was a nice touch, and fitting. The character designs were fine, although none of the animal characteristics were explained for anyone besides Hans. (I\u2019m a bit curious about this. Maybe the light novel explains it?) The action scenes were mostly marvellous. Really well animated \u2013 well, except for the CGI attacks, some of which quite frankly looked poor. Especially Mora\u2019s. A few CGI scenes didn\u2019t make much difference overall though. The sound was good, no complaints on that front.\\n\\n\r\nMinor bugbear: Fremy\u2019s outfit. There didn\u2019t seem to be excessive fanservice in this show or anything, so I\u2019m not taking a point off, but dressing her like that didn\u2019t add anything whatsoever to the show. Whatever. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was slightly disappointing, it felt somewhat rushed compared to the rest of the series, and I know I for one could have done with more explanation on a couple of the events. Hope there\u2019s a second season, I can't wait to see how the rest of their adventure unfolds.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A great watch. A few parts that felt rushed, but on the whole really enjoyable and entertaining. I\u2019d recommend if you like whodunit mysteries, anime with good action scenes, or adventure series. XD\\n",

            "content": "This review is more personal than critical on the artistic value and such, because that was how it affected me the most. \r\nFrom the moment I got started with Rokka no Yuusha, I surprised myself by burning through the episodes in less than 24 hours. Why, was because for a long time, I had become emotionally sterile to stories depicted in anime and movies alike. The most reaction any episode would elicit from me would be an occasional chuckle or cringing at how cheesy the events were. I stopped caring about most of the characters and just wanted a truck to plow through some ofthem. \\n\\n\r\nThat was not the case with RnY. For once, I actually gave a damn about what happened to the characters. Finally, I could watch the development of relationships between characters without shielding my eyes from the screen to avoid seeing all the oozing mushiness. Now, I don't hate mushiness. It appeals to my imagination that others make it where I failed. However, it should only be injected into story after the characters have gone through much hardship and difficulty to get where they wanted to.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing the 12 episodes, I searched for the continuation (6 novels and counting) and read the remaining story up to where the author has left it. I must say, I've never felt that much for personalities in a story in a long while. It was the same feeling I had when I used to write stories and think about the challenges I would put my characters through and the joy of overcoming each harrowing event. It reminded me of that feeling, and being reminded, I will pick up the pen again, even though the people who used to compliment my work are no longer close by. Because I will always want to feel that again, when your heart wants to melt and your senses overflow with happiness that you feel for the characters. \\n\\n\r\nIt saddened me that the animated series didn't sell very well, and I promise to purchase an original copy if I catch it on sale. Lastly, I apologize if this is a most improper format for a review.\\n\\n\r\n*I got an original DVD :D",

Overcome with despair, the only hope left for the world is for the goddess to choose her six heroes, and send them on their great quest to vanquish this evil. But what will they do when a possible seventh and fake hero is hidden among them? As our hero becomes the prime target of suspicion, he is tasked with proving his innocence, or otherwise facing the consequences of death.\r\nWhen starting this show I didn't look at the genre labels, and therefor was expecting yourusual cookie cutter show where the heroes fight off the evil demon lord to save the kingdom. A story that has since become way overdone in both anime and especially in manga. But boy was I pleasantly surprised.\\n\\n\r\n=== Beware: Venture no further if you fear the beast known as SPOILERS===\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\n(Quick Plot Synopsis)\\n\r\nKicking us off, we are introduced to the main character Adlet Mayer, self proclaimed strongest man in the world, who is set on becoming one of the six heroes. In fact he is so confident in his abilities that he interrupts a holy fight taking place in front of the goddess, managing to get himself thrown in jail as a result. It is in there that he unknowingly becomes acquaintances with the princess of the kingdom Nashetania, another future hero. Adlet is forsaken to rot in a hole for the rest of his life as punishment for his actions, however this life sentence is interrupted only weeks after its implementation by the incoming invasion of demons, followed by his nomination as one of the six heroes.\\n\r\nIt is at this point that both he and Nashetania leave to meet up with the other four heroes. Along the way to the meet up point they find a village under attack, after evacuating the village, Adlet returns to the village to investigate for the supposedly left behind person. There he meets Flamie, another one of the six heroes, but also a notorious villain known for having slain countless hero candidates. However unbeknownst to him, he decides to follow her instead of returning to Nashetania. Meanwhile on Nashetania's end, she meets up with Goldof (previously her protector since their youth) and the two team up. Both groups come across a temple where at they are taught a ritual to help them in their quest to defeat the demon lord, a spell that will close off the kingdom from the demon world, but once it is activated, cannot be escaped from.\\n\r\nEventually both groups come into contact and Flamie is met with the attacks of both Nashetania and Goldof, however confident that Flamie is no enemy, Adlet protects her and manages to persuade the both of them that she is not dangerous. It is around this point (episode 4) where the mystery genre really picks up, and we are introduced to the concept of a seventh and possible fake hero among the group.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 7\\n\r\nThe cast was another case in which an anime presented me with unique and fun characters. All of them came from different backgrounds and because of this provided some form of differing opinion from the others; the princess (who seemingly knows very little about the outside world), the unknown man Adlet (comes from a background of sadness and tribulation), Goldof (servant/ protector, only duty in life is to protect the girl whom he also loves Nashetania), famous assassin Hans (has no remorse and is very perceptive), ... \\n\r\nEach character with their own unique background means that they might prefer certain characters over others. The best example of this is when they are first faced with choosing who the culprit (ie. the fake hero) is, their person of choice is Flamie, seeing as how she is indeed part demon and would therefore have a reason to attack them. But after Adlet proves her innocent, all eyes turn to him. His history is unknown, he was the one at the scene of the crime when it happened, and has no way of convicting anyone else. What I believe might have made for another interesting plot twist was if he truly was the seventh/fake, and we watched the story unfold from the perspective of the villain. However that is not the case, and instead we watch as Adlet is tasked with proving his innocence somehow, all the while trying to avoid being killed.\\n\r\nIn terms of character development I was kind of confused as to how to rate it. Truly there wasn't much in terms of character development save for the relation between Adlet and Flamie. I mean there is also how Hans has a change of heart, kind of, but also doesn't. While he does accept Adlet as innocent, he doesn't do so out of the kindness of his heart. Instead it is due to the fact that enough evidence has been demonstrated to clear his name. The only other case would have to be all of the characters reaction to (SPOILER) Nashetania revealing herself as the culprit. This revelation is a juicy bit that could lead to some serious character development in a future season, Goldof broken and unable to believe eventually overcoming his disbelief to further an important cause, and other such situations.\\n\r\nPlot: 9\\n\r\nPacing: 8\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the story, people who say it doesn't work, and that there are too many plot holes never seem to provide me with these supposed plot holes that exist everywhere. I mean yeah sure the magic as a concept probably has problems, but that has nothing to do with the plot of the mystery, which is the meat of this story. When we are first told that one among the characters is the villain, we instantly rule out the characters who we have grown attached to: Goldof, Adlet, Flamie, and Nashetania. This trick makes us automatically assume that the actual guilty party (Nashetania) is innocent, making the reveal at the end so much more interesting. For the longest time, it was to my belief that Mora was the seventh, however it is also in my belief that the writers intended this as well. She is drawn up as someone who is authoritative, and once she has set her mind on the target, doesn't let up. From her point of view the only possible choice is Adlet, but from our point of view, we see someone trying to push the blame onto the character with the least possible chance. This in turn makes us dislike her character, making us more inclined to see her as the enemy.\\n\r\nWhen the show finally reveals the culprit, you might be thinking to yourself I had my doubts about her, as I did myself, or you might be thinking that it makes no sense at all. Luckily it does an excellent job explaining how she is the culprit, and why everything makes sense. The only real problem that I have with the ending is her motivations, while I hope that there is a more deeply seeded reason behind her actions, the simple response of: it\u2019s what I felt like doing, angered me.\\n\r\nThe show did a very good job with the pacing however I only have one, but still very big, problem. It took too long to get where the meat of the story was, for the first four episodes I was convinced that this was an action fantasy only, no mystery had been introduced until episode four. It is my belief that this is too long of a period (especially in a show that is only 12 episodes long) to spend building up the story and world. The show spent a third of its episodes on world building, episodes which could have been spent fleshing out the investigation, or adding more elements of mystery, and it\u2019s for that reason that I was disappointed with how the show was structured.\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\r\nThe art style in my opinion suited the show to a T, not only did it have a light elegance to it which corresponded well with the scenes full of dialogue, but also fit well with the action sequences that are to be expected of an action adventure. My only complaint was with the CG monsters. I for one am not a fan of CG and find that it is a way for lazy artists to get out of extra work. This is especially true seeing as how they are the only objects in the show given 3D models, making them jarring to look at.\\n\r\nThe music was nice, that\u2019s about it, nothing spectacular, however I will make note of the fact that that for a short show they did have multiple openings and endings, something that pleases me very much (reminded me of the monogatari series), and made me raise the lowered grade.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI adored this show, not only did it surprise me with how well done it was, but it also provided me with a fun and interesting days watch. That\u2019s right, while I usually don\u2019t binge watch unless it\u2019s a really good show, I couldn\u2019t stop watching this. I can only imagine how agonizing it was to wait a whole week for a new episode. I enjoyed this so thoroughly it was the first time in a long time that I considered giving a show a 10 in terms of enjoyment. This was by far my favorite show of the summer season, with Himouto Umaru-chan trailing right behind it. If you have yet to watch this show definitely get on it as it will not disappoint you, and even if you don\u2019t find it as intellectually stimulating as you would have hopped, I guarantee that you will still enjoy it.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 82/100\\n\r\nHope you enjoyed this review and found it helpful, let me know if you have any questions, comments, or want to make suggestions to help me improve my writing. Thank you very much and I hope you have a nice day.",

            "content": "This is a short, spoiler-free review. I'm writing this assuming that you have either read the plot or watched the anime.\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story about a bunch of heroes coming together to kill the evil king is one of the oldest, most cliche you can find, and it gets repetitive to some people. However, Rokka no Yuusha was different. If you're starting it halfheartedly just by reading the plot, then please do so. I did the same. Read the plot, decided the story was good enough and watched. But it pulled me into a complete different scene. I was very impressed at how the writer ofthis managed to play with the mind of everyone, characters and viewers/readers alike. Absolutely astonishing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art was amazing. I've seen like it before, yet it's unique in its own way. They also did a great job in mimicking the light novel, which is always a good thing, since if you know a bit about LN, then you know they usually always look similar in the anime adaptions. The fight scenes were well done, although a little weird at times but still does a good job at delivering what we want.\\n\\n\r\nSounds: 9\\n\r\nI was so impressed! I usually only listen to the Openings and Endings once, but in this anime, one particular ending had me listening till the very end. The voice actor were popular but very well chosen. Nobody but Hisaka Yoko could've done Nashetania justice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nI will not get very deep into the characters as that would be major spoilers, and I recommend that you watch this without reading their MAL profiles. My favourite was Nashetania. I was very neutral to most other except for her. She left such a good taste in my mouth whatever she's done! She's eye catching and special! For her, I'd read the light novel even.\\n\r\nFor once tho, I didn't have a least favourite.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nGreatly enjoyable. Unless you're Sherlock Holmes, I'd say the events keep you on your toes and you'd be glad you didn't watch this while it was airing! I finished it in one go, and that in itself says a lot. You see a mix of so many things different people would enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9- Great.",

            "content": "You know the weird thing is, I thought the main character was going to be named \"Rokka\", because of the title. Well that is just me being stupid. Anyways, this is a review and I am reviewing Rokka no Yuusha. I won't keep you waiting so I'll get on with the review\r\nStory:\r\n The story was well told and how the mystery of the anime kept you wondering who did this and who did that was very fun. This review on a mystery anime might be a bit biased due to the fact I've only watched a few mystery animes or have seen animes with amystery arc. In Rokka no Yuusha though, it kept me wondering, questioning and suspecting many characters. What does take away from the mystery element is the fact that the protagonist was already innocent since we the audience can hear his thoughts, but it didn't take away much of the mystery elements so I was still fine with it. So with the story as it is, I pretty much liked the pace and way the anime was going. Even the ending had a twist due to the one character being the least suspected when I was watching.\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art was good, but it didn't blow me away as many other anime did. Though the movements and animation were fluent, it only based around one setting about 2/3rds of the series so it didn't take as much background work and detailing on the background wasn't that great. Still, it didn't put me to the point where I drop the series due to the terrible animation. Still it was good at best.\\n\r\nScore: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nWhat I like about the sound was the sound effects of the anime. It fit through what was supposed to make sounds and it sounded great. The soundtrack were also good as it fit most parts of scenes very well. What I liked the most was the two openings. These openings were amazing as I always watched and listened to it every episode. \\n\r\nScore: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nHonestly, this is the strongest aspect of the anime as it leaves you to see who is innocent and who is to be suspected to be the culprit. Having only 7 characters 2/3rds of the time, it lets you question and wonder who is the culprit of the so called \"crime\". It did have some twists and surprises. it definitely surprised me in the end and how they interacted with each other was fantastic also. All the characters are driven to survive and prove they are innocent as their life is on the line if they are to be suspected the most.\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the heck out of Rokka no Yuusha. It is one of the few anime where it misled me to believe someone was the culprit when others were to blame also. It kept me on the edge of my seat as I tried to figure out who was the culprit before the reveal happened. It also kept me going with the series as it made me run through all the episodes in one night.\\n\r\nIt was very enjoyable and I am hoping I will see a season 2 of this anime, because I want more of this anime.\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI liked this anime a lot and I enjoyed every episode of it. I honestly think this truly deserves a sequel as there are 5 light novel volumes it can adapt.\\n\r\nThis anime made me thirst for more and led me to read the light novels. I recommend anyone to give this anime a try. It may not be the greatest anime you've seen out there, but it is worth a try.\\n\r\nScore: 10/10\\n",

            "content": "P R E M I S E\r\nRokka no Yuusha is, simply put, not popular. It's not a familiar title; I've never heard of it until I saw one of the characters (Fremy/Flamie) on Google Images. Originally a light novel series, this anime adaption is outstanding art-wise, and does follow rather closely to the first novel thus far for the first season. However, even for only 12 full episodes and adapting the first novel, be prepared for a lack of... action, per se. In other words, you'll be left feeling like nothing happened by the end of the season, and hopefully, the anime will continue tofuture seasons according to the novels.\\n\\n\r\nI've read a blog post translated into English basically summarizing each light novel in long paragraphs, so I basically spoiled myself silly before watching the anime. The anime itself is quite clear and well-executed, and reminds me a bit of SAO, Danganronpa, and the like. I find it interesting that the protagonist isn't your ordinary innocent, normal-gone-powerful character (and based off the character design alone, he oh-so obviously looks the part) - Adlet Mayer comes off as cocky and controlling in a comical way, as his abilities seem mediocre beside the other Braves.\\n\\n\r\nS H O R T C O M I N G S\\n\r\nIf you've seen The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies, it's like this anime. The anime feels very dragged, to put it bluntly. The main characters are stuck in one place for most of the episodes, and they're busy being suspicious of each other rather than being focused on the reason why they're there, the main task at hand. The reason for this is because there are apparently supposed to be six of them chosen to defeat an enemy force, but seven meet. You'd think that the problem would be solved within an episode or two, maybe three at most, but it drags on for 12 episodes. Unfortunately, that causes the feeling that nothing is happening, when there are things that are happening, like the characters showing their powers by battling against each other and such. The quality too slips midway, and that's such a shame to me because I enjoyed the first episodes. The OP and ED are also not memorable, as they've really easily slipped past my mind. Lastly, the characters may look pretty, but most of them serve as plot devices, either moving forward the story or holding it back. It's very tiring.\\n\\n\r\nP R O S\\n\r\nDespite the lack in plot, which I've explained the reason in the \"premise,\" the anime still incorporates a shroud of mystery and requires some brain power to piece things together without making many things seem obvious. I've spoiled myself (dang it), but that still didn't cause me to be unsurprised at the turn of events near the climax. It's not the best for mystery-fans, and they'll definitely not get a hoot for this, but this includes more of action and such to keep me preoccupied. There are parts that raise questioning and that seem completely random and strange, or even out-of-place, but they do come back to bite your nose at the end, and that excited me. The characters have very unique designs and have great, original names. The art is the best part, and I give it the highest score because it's consistent and I've had so many urges to pause each episode just to bask in its beauty - I'm not kidding, that's the only reason why I decided to watch it initially. The animation is fantastic as well, but it does go wayward somewhere... it upsets me so much!\\n\\n\r\nC L O S U R E\\n\r\nIn the end, my rating for this anime overall is high because it's not bad. The only problem with it is how dragged it feels, really. If the creators decided to fit 2 light novels in 12 episodes, however, I know that that'd be difficult. Maybe I'm just wishing that the author of the light novels would put more action in each novel. I am currently reading the translated version on a hardworking blog, looking at it all myself, so Rokka no Yuusha's story will likely be more interesting that way.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nOverall: 37/50 ~ 74% ~ 7/10",

            "content": "THIS IS A REVIEW BASED ON MY PURE OPINION. BE AWARE THAT THERE'S NO OBJECTIVE REVIEW. THEY'RE THOUGHTS BASED ON THE REVIEWER'S TASTE AND COMMON SENSE.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThis plot is one of the most clich\u00e9 in the world. An evil and heroes get called from the GOD to defeat him. it's not either the first time it appears, so you probably would think that this generation has an easy job because they already know the enemy and they gained experience and wisdom from the previous genenrations stories. Yes, it seems like a boring show but .. !\r\nAs you've read on the synopsis: \"However, when they finallyunite, seven heroes are present, and soon the others begin to suspect Adlet to be a fraud.\". It's the first time an incident like this appears. The seventh can't be found by some traditional methods. They all seem genuine. And here, the struggle begins !\\n\\n\r\nOne more good point about the story is that the author isn't superficial. He goes beyond the standard good fighting bad to each one fighting for what they think is wrong. And that what make the story interesting.\\n\\n\r\n                                 -------------------------------------------\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nBoth the charcter design and the fantasy world are somehow original and pleasant. The animation is decent. It make the battle more enjoyable. The job was well done, not to mention the fact that the studio is a new one.\\n\\n\r\n                                 -------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\n2 Openning & 3 Endings. I don't remember them well because I skipped them to watch the episodes (The hyper bro, the hype). And about the OST, they're suited for the fantasy setting. But nothing outstanding.\\n\\n\r\n                                 -------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters: 7 Heroes are all unique in their backrounds and fighting style. A vomit maniac girl who's considerd the strongest person alive, a hit man who excell at every aspect of fight, a princes who can control blade, a wisdom saint with increadible power, a cold sniper girl, a 16y old renowed knight, and a trickster self proclaimed \"The strongest man in the world\" who has both fighting skills & sharp mind. \\n\r\nA good mix of different personnalities with different fighting styles. And close in term of strength.\\n\\n\r\n                                 -------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: 10/10\\n\r\nTo be honest, I watched this show by pure chance. And it turned out to be one of my favorite anime. I was really hyped till the last episode and I even read its LN version. The following arcs are even better. Its LN is my favorite original source of an anime.\\n\\n\r\n                                 -------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nWhy this show has low rating?\\n\r\n- It's a LN adaptation, not as famous as a manga would be.\\n\r\n- Its manga adaptation sucks and take a different route from the LN (and the anime)\\n\r\n- Fantasy setting and art isn't everyone cup of tea.\\n\r\n- The story is a derivation of a clich\u00e9 one.\\n\r\n- This show contains 0% fan service.\\n\\n\r\nI tried to summarize the most. I wish you find this review \"helpfull\".",

            "content": "Rokka no Yusha is an anime about a world where there is a war between the demon king  and the humans,where once every few hundread of years the demon king awekens and causes great damage in the world,and its up to 6 heroes(the soo called braves of the six flowers) chosen by the goddes of fate to fight the demon king and put him back to sleep.\r\nStory:7\r\nThe story itself begins whit our very inventive ,cocky and very lively MC Adled Mayer,the self-proclaimed \"strongest man in the world\" ( and he might as well be if he has his toys whit him),coming to an tournamentwhere the winner is suposed to be chosen as one of the six braves,however the tournament is disturbed by our MC who claims victory on both last 2 combatants,using various weapons and tricky strategis to win.He then asks for his rightfull title in front of all the crowd ,before being thrown in the prison for destroying the tournament,but he is later saved by the Princess Nachetanya.Now,this is the premise of the show,however the intrigue apears in a later episode where a 7th brave apear and then the mystery begind.As the story is not something revolutionary i gave it a 7,because a shounen dosent realy need a groundbreaking and original story to be enjoyed,therfor i didint cut much from the score.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very good for this series and it also dose a very good job at makeing the atmosphere very engrosing.This is also one of the only shows that has more opening songs for a 12 episodes series(it has 2 oppenings and 3 endings),and the last opening is pretty good,even great.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:7\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fairly good for a new studio,so i will cut it some slak for the drop in animation from time to time.The artstyle is very good and the charater designs are pretty unique and have soul put into them.There is also some bad as fuck CGI,but dont worry it is not used that often,and allmost not used at all in the part where the show becomes good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:9\\n\\n\r\nThe show basicly has only 7 characters,the braves.The seven are :Adlet\"the strongest man in the world\",Maura the Saint of the Mountain,Chamot the Saint of Swamps,Nachetanya the Saint of Swords,Goldov ,who is an overlyloyal warior to the Saint of Swords,Hans,an assasin that learned to be agile from cats and shows his respect for cats by talking like them ,and lastly Flammy.Exept Goldov all characters have a fairly good amount of screentime whit Flemmy,Hans and of course Adlet being in the spotlinght,in this first season.I would also say that the caracters carry this show,but then again for what show is this not true? \\n\\n\r\nI gave the show 9 in the caracter department because i enjoyed them greatly and especialy the relationship between Adlet and Flemmy ,and the interactions between our MC and Hans.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\\n\r\nOk,now personaly i never understood how can u score enjoyement to be honest,but i loved this anime so i give it 10(just so i make the score higher i guess,dont hate me).\\n\r\nUsualy other ppl will finish the review at this point and give the conclusion i would assume,but i will instead give my opinions on some things that can be a bit strange/confusing around this anime.So first thing,this anime is not actualy about the braves fighting the demon king,but its about the mistery of who is the sevent,and if u have seen many misteries(u will realise who is the fake using meta logic) or u just have a strong logic mind(using reverse psihology u can probably also find the the fake by reduicing the suspects) it wont be hard to to find who is the fake brave,so the story dosen't have a very strong mistery element to it,so dont watch it for the mistery exclusivly(altough i would argue the mistery in this anime dose not reside in who the brave is,but why do this things happen and what drives the caracters to be what they are),but for the caracter interactions and the action which is not outstanding,but is still very entartaining.\\n\\n\r\nSo my advice is:If u like the fighting and the personality of Adlet and Fremy u should give it a try.\\n\r\nIf u find adlet abnoxious and the feameles bitches(which some superfficial assholes say they are just based on the clothing they use,but dont worry ,they dont wear clothes that only cover 10% of their skin.They just wear some unique fantasy clothing)\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score:8\\n\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it much,and i hope u will too.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Nevertheless, I hope my enthusiasm reaches you.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nAbsolutely fantastic. The mystery and intrigue blended well with each character's actions and story, leading us along an insane locked room detective adventure, complete with battles, theories, facts, and a grand climax.\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nThe characters had great designs and the locale was very vibrant. Nothing struck me as incredible, and at times, you could tell the production value wasn't massive. But it still gave a positive impression. Greatcolor scheme as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSome of the tracks were just perfect. One of the battle themes, in fact, is stuck in my head even now. And the OP music style changed to match the mood, which was a great touch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is great. Being a mystery, the rapid changes, theories, backstories and facts all mix together, leading to a race of thought: well, this guy has this backstory, which might suggest this; but this other chap is unknown in this regard, so maybe he might be the one... And so on. The intrigue only serves to drive character development forward rapidly in an excellent manner.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI've always loved mysteries blended with action. This fits the bill. Everything worked out wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI am very glad to have watched this.",

            "content": "I did not have huge expectations for Rokka no Yuusha when I first started it. As I went into the series blind, I assumed it was another \"band together to fight the baddies\" type of show. Luckily, as I kept watching, I was surprised how much I enjoyed the story, music and characters. As someone who is a fan of mystery, it was quite entertaining trying to piece together all the subtle hints along the way until the mystery is revealed in the finale.  \r\nThe music was a great match for the suspense and action scenes, and was reminiscent of the scores from olderHollywood movies with lots of great violin pieces. It encapsulated the tension and atmosphere of the show perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nEven with only 12 episodes, most of the main characters were individually interesting, or at least intriguing. It definitely leaves you with a desire to know more about them and their history. I particularly liked that Adlet, the main character, was not like the stereotypical overpowered, zero calorie, boring protagonists we see almost every season.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I quite liked the overall character designs and the vague Mayan influences, the animation has a lot of room for improvement. Poorly drawn scenes become more and more apparent as the series progresses. However, I frankly believe that the story and music were able to compensate for the art most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Rokka no Yuusha was a very enjoyable and clever show with good pacing. The build up to the finale leaves everyone on the edge for the revelation of the imposter. It is definitely worth a rewatch to catch any clues you missed from your first viewing.",

            "content": "Every time the Demon God awakens, 6 people are selected as the \"Six Braves\" and are tasked with defeating the Demon God. However, when 7 people show up, all claiming to be part of the \"Six Braves\", everyone realizes that someone among them is a fake, AKA the \"Seventh Brave\".\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nThe story is original, I'll give it that. It was different than lots of other things I've seen, but similarly enough that it wasn't absurdly unrealistic. The one thing however, is that no one ever actually gets to their real goal. \r\nThe anime shows in the first few episodes that everyone is clearly guided todefeat the Demon God, but they all hit a detour when they get trapped inside the barrier. As the show goes on, it takes the entire first season (hoping there'll be a second) to get out of the barrier and reveal the Seventh. \\n\\n\r\nMy only real problem with the story, is that they get too off topic from it. I originally thought it would be a story about trying to defeat the Demon God, but instead I got surprised with a completely new story.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the anime can go really slow. Even though it's only 12 episodes, the creators could've spent less time in the beginning doing pointless things and spent more time showing hints towards the Seventh.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nNo complaints about the art, I think it is phenomenal. All the characters have their own distinctive physical looks, which I really enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are amazing too, although a lot of it goes to waste as you spent from episode 4 and on staring at scenery of fog and trees.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nThe sound was great. The background music was all perfectly in place and added a lot of suspense.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP's were good. The first one was mediocre, but the second one exceeded so far beyond my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nChracter (7/10):\\n\r\nMy main problems would probably be the characters. None of the characters except Flamie and Adlet got any time dedicated to their past. The creators spent too much time showing Flamie's trust issues and Adlet's cockiness that no one else got any screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the pasts that they showed made me dislike Flamie even more than I first did. She was a stubborn, emotionless person, but it felt like it was so over exaggerated that it got to the point where it was unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10):\\n\r\nAs far as my enjoyment goes, I really had a great time watching this anime. It made me want to know what happen and develop having theories of my own. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10):\\n\r\nHonestly, this anime was amazing. It is beyond words, especially if you love mysteries. This anime had me suspecting almost everyone at some point, even the main protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nMy only regret is: now I have to wait for the second season\\n\\n",

I never expected myself to watch this, but here I am; and this anime definitely exceeded my expectations.  Rokka no Yuusha is not the anime of the year, but it is a solid summer show that will make your brain think a lot more than a regular fantasy action anime for sure.\r\nPros:\r\n-Extremely likable characters: Upon first inspection, the protagonist, Adlet, seems very generic.  He looks like someone who would protect everyone and would try hard to accomplish his goals.  He doesfit under this label, but I felt a difference in his character.  His arsenal and fighting style is unique and not needlessly overpowered.  His importance makes sense from his well-rounded upbringing, which includes science, making him pretty smart.  I also thought Hans was a great character.  His fighting style of knives appeals to me and he has a great deal of charisma built into him.  The final notable character is Flamie, who has an interesting backstory.\\n\\n\r\n-Awesome mystery: I did not expect the mystery aspect to be done so well.  I found myself struggling to figure out the suspect.  There was a decent amount of depth put into the puzzle and new factors were continuously being brought in.\\n\\n\r\n-Good plot twists and story overall: Plot twists made me gasp and hit my table a few times because they are very unexpected.  In my experience, I felt that the mystery would just end, but it was constantly being changed in new ways.\\n\\n\r\n-Great sound: There is a healthy dose of orchestral music and it made me smile and appreciate the scenes more.  Both of the OPs are extraordinary and the EDs are solid as well. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n-Inconsistent art: Some parts have a drastic change in art quality, that are very noticeable.  It bothered me because I was used to a decent level for most of the anime and there are random sprinkles of badly drawn scenes.\\n\\n\r\n-Lackluster action scenes:  I thought that some action scenes were decent, but there were times where I felt like this swing could have looked better or that dodge could have looked crisper, etc.  Certain camera angles or points of view seemed bizarre.\\n\\n\r\n-Troll ending: The ending felt forced and unnecessary.  I felt huge facepalm urges because my watching of the anime almost felt like a waste.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.3/10\\n\r\nA great mystery anime in a different type of setting.\\n",

            "content": "Fresh off of finishing this about a minute ago i have to say this series has to be one of the most enjoyable new anime series that i have seen all year long. Victory Baxter of the chill grill with another review my final one to be exact i'm going to start enjoying instead of watching to just write reviews. This series has a light novel with about 6 volumes the anime goes through the first volume id suggest picking it up if you enjoyed the anime i will be picking it up myself if i can find it.\r\nStory- In the early part of theanime the story is basically presented as gathering the 6 braves to fight the demon God very bland but then as the story goes in the main objective is to find out who is the 7th brave is aka the fake brave among the 6 there was one fake one and it turns into some Sherlock Holmes mystery stuff which at first i didn't care to see it but it was really hard deciding who the fake could have been because of the way the characters were portrayed but anyways fast forward and all it became really interesting hearing the dialogue and the back story of the characters which became the heart and soul of the series remove the fight scenes and you are still left with a really good story. I enjoyed this anime so much the story very well done i could have done without the many many cliffhangers but overall it has to be a 10/10 in my books.\\n\\n\r\nArt- It looked different which i liked not your generic looking shounen granted this isn't a shounen but still it looked different i liked the art style and the character designs for Flamie, Adlet and Hans they looked pretty cool as for the rest they looked good as well. It wasn't all perfect though there are some derps you'll see such in the final episode  like 2-3 minutes in you'll see derps many series have derps so its not a major issue.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The music has to be best if not the 2nd best thing about this entire anime the opening is f*cking amazing they didn't need to change the 1st opening but they did but it was still really good the ending is good the ost is great as well the overall soundtrack is definitely hard hitting for action scenes the opening music scene and you get the ominous mysterious music when someone is being named a suspect for being a brave.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- One word \"amazing\" There are characters that you just love and of course some you hate but overall the characterization of the main characters just give you the feeling of \"everything is so good\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -  10/10 Due to the great soundtrack, outstanding story with many plot twists and characters as well as the animation in the fight scenes i will excuse the shit known as cgi that was in the series although very little still there but overall i found this series as being a jem in the entire season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10",

            "content": "The Majin is reviving! Seven Heroes will assemble to reseal him before he can destroy the world. Welcome to a plot more common than the thought of Bill Gates making money.\r\nStory: 8.5\r\nCompared to the rest of the anime, the story is completely bland and overused. Until it is not. The actual plot begins to take effect when 7 braves become caught in an enemy trap. As there cannot be more than 6 braves, this obviously becomes a problem. The anime's plot focuses on the aspect of mystery and suspense. Who is the 7th brave? How will our main protagonist resolve his conflicts regarding the seventhbrave? These questions drastically change the aspect of the anime that started off very bland and unoriginal into something intriguing and mysterious.\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe animation of Rokka no Yuusha is nothing special by any margin. In fact, when compared to many other animation styles that are showcased during Rokka no Yuusha's season, it looks underwhelming in comparison. Despite this, it still does its job and performs without harming the anime.\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe music for Rokka no Yuusha is certainly no slouch. The soundtrack for Rokka no Yuusha adds a lot to the intense fight scenes that the anime likes to present. It also does a nice job creating suspense and mystery, two things that the anime constantly highlights.\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nWhile the characters are not wholeheartedly generic, they are by no means interesting. Except Adlet Mayer. Adlet Mayer's character makes up almost all of the character development in Rokka no Yuusha. In doing so, he becomes something highly understandable. He becomes someone who is viewed as intelligent. Most of all, he becomes someone who changes throughout the series. This change is very entertaining to watch and can get you really invested into Rokka no Yuusha.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI Enjoyed Rokka no Yuusha a lot. Its ability to create suspense was highlighted a lot throughout the series, making it really interesting to watch. The character that is Adlet Mayer is very unique and kept me very interested and excited to keep watching.\\n\r\nOverall: B\\n\r\nThe mean of the scores add up to 8.3. That is in fact a B. There are a few reasons why I decided that Rokka no Yuusha deserved the B it received. This has a lot to do with the execution of the anime. The anime's purpose was not to be a thrilling war anime filled with amazing magic and powers. The purpose was to create suspense, to be mysterious, and to keep the audience on their seats. In this aspect, they certainly succeeded. However in doing so, they ignored a lot of other elements that separate the good from the great.",

Based on enjoyment alone I'm giving this show a higher rating than I usually do. \r\nThe largest flaw I can see after completing Rokka is its completely convoluted attempt at a mystery. It gives you no chance to figure out \"whodunnit\" on your own and uses magic to explain how events came to pass. (even more annoying magic that you do not already know about)\r\nThe second complementary flaw is how while Rokka no Yuusha is primarily a action show it spends its whole time centered around its convoluted mystery.\r\nNow I see these two major flaws andseveral minor ones however I can honestly say I don't care. I went into Rokka with no expectations and was entertained on every episode. I feel the best way to enjoy rokka is to not have any preconceptions and to not spend your time trying to figure out a impossible mystery.",

Nobody is this world writes stories with twists and turns better than the Japanese and this in one of those clear cases that u might think u known but deep down u are not sure and the story kind shows u exactly the opposite ofwhat u were thinking it was. A suspense from begging till the end as the story unfolds and amazes U every step of the way. The characters are mysterious and all different in their own unique way the music and the figths scenes are very good but the story is the Must of this anime  This is not a action anime ..

The beginning plot with the Goddess's prophecy is mainstream, but it is mixed with a mystery surprises the audience and I liked it. The story is amazingly made, so the audience will have no idea what is the answer to the mystery but if they watch it to the end. The animation is good, for a combatanime and the movements are fluids, but it is not extraordinary. The sound is as good as the animation, with good combat sounds, but not enough to be exceptionnal. The characters are a special part, because some of them are really well made and thought, but some are too mainstream and follow some stereotypes, such as Adlet.\\n\\n\r\nThat's why I gave a 7/10 rate to this series.\\n\\n\r\nI recommand this series to people that like adventure anime, but mostly to people that like mystery anime and combat anime.

            "content": "Let\u2019s make an anime where we get 7 heroes to gather up and defeat the demon god. Wait doesn\u2019t that sound very generic to begin with. No one of them is a traitor, there is only supposed to be 6, so it\u2019s actually a mystery on finding out who the 7th is. (The Video Review is up on my Channel, but here is the written)\r\nStory - 8/10\r\nThe story of Rokka starts off pretty basic. As we get our hero Adlet Mayer has been chosen as one of six heroes to participate in a quest to defeat the Demon God. Now initially when you think tryingto defeat a Demon God, another generic villain name, you wouldn\u2019t expect much of this anime. However by the end of episode 4, it is revealed  7 heroes have been picked, whereas it\u2019s supposed to be 6. So one of the heroes is actually a fake and traitor. And so begins the mystery thriller on to find who the seventh brave is. \\n\\n\r\nThe story initially starts off slow and uninteresting, because it\u2019s just a generic quest for the first 4 episodes. After that, the story gets interesting and focuses on the theme of truth and lies. As the plot progresses we are given more hints on who are the seventh is. Because of the way it\u2019s structured we don\u2019t find out till the very end, so the mystery gets really dragged until the end. I can\u2019t help but feel they the seventh very obvious, so to me if felt, like waiting for them to reveal my answer, and I was correct. However the ending, not to spoil anything felt like a dick move to the viewers. As they try to introduce a new characters, and let\u2019s leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nBecause there are seven amin characters, I\u2019m going to go through this quickly. Our main protagonist is Adlet Mayer, the self-proclaimed strongest man in the world. Well maybe the strongest man, but the most cunning. He is the main target of all the heroes to be the fake, as they all suspect that it\u2019s him. So he is out to prove he\u2019s innocence while solving the mystery of who is the real fake. Over the course of the series, I wouldn\u2019t say he really develops, as he just pretty much plays a role in everyone\u2019s development, but he himself doesn\u2019t really develop. He job is to keep the story moving forward.\\n\\n\r\nThe other six braves are Nashetania, a Princess of Piena and Adlet\u2019s first friend and ally. Fremmy Speeddraw a mysterious sniper, known to actually kill potential breaves. Godolf Auroa one of the knights of the Piena Kingdom and childhood friend of Nashetania. Chamo Rossa, the youngest of the heroes and considered the strongest out of all the heroes. Mora Chester, a mature woman known being the leader of the saints of the temple. And lastly there is Hans Humpty an assassin, with cat like features.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters with the most development is Nashetania and Fremy, as their past is shown more and their feelings are explored on when, they are out to kill Adlet. Hans gets some development as well, as he starts becoming more reliable and not such a mystery character. Only Mora and Chamo feel like they don\u2019t developed at all, because their views don\u2019t really change as the story progress. What I do like what the writers with the character is that, all them have a reason for being the seventh. So it does make the mystery a bit harder, but some characters are played out in a very obvious way that it shows whether they are the fake or non-fake.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 8/10, 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is pretty standard, when comparing to most anime, you won\u2019t find anything to unique. But I like how there is a lot different unique character designs, which is really nice to see. And the show starts off with bright colours, but soon fades the colour palette to fit with the mystery theme. There is the one thing obvious with the animation, is the overuse of CGI. The CGI really looks out of place in the anime, and some of the monster designs don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re part of the world. Normally CGI are used for monsters, however Rokka also uses it for background and stationary objects, which really is kind of distracting from the characters. The animation is probably at its best when there is fight scene, and the action scenes in this anime is pretty good, if you can ignore the CGI in it, which looks out of placed. The fact that every character has a unique way of fighting, there is quite a diverse animation for the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is quite forgettable, there is no track in there, that is worth listening to on its own. The soundtrack is made up of a string orchestra, and they don\u2019t play anything that really adds to the scenes, and is only there to fill in the silence. Because there is a lot of talking used to build up to the finale. The same cannot be said for the Opening Songs, as they really get you hyped for the upcoming show, with the sudden change in vocal style and pace. The Endings, although it\u2019s nice they give a classic old touch, they aren\u2019t really special and the animation for it, is kind of boring to see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor of this anime, really depends on how quick you\u2019re able to solve the mystery. If you\u2019re flustered, you might actually enjoy this anime a lot. For me personally since, I felt it was predictable, I felt it was drag to the reveal, since I kind of figured it out early. Not to mention the story doesn\u2019t get interesting until the end of episode 4. However I like the action scenes as we got to see a lot of unique fights because of the unique variety of characters. And I would say there is some enjoyable moments in the build up to the end. But at the same time, I felt the end cheated me, even though I guessed right.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSo for the story of Rokka, I give it a 8. The story may start out slow and the end feels like a dick move. I really liked the change to a mystery on who the fake brave is, as it takes us on a rollercoaster ride and giving us subtle hints on who the fake is.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound, I give it a 8 and 5. The animation and art style is good, using the bright colours to signify it\u2019s an adventure then transitions to a much more faded palette which fitted the mystery. The character designs are unique and reflects on the action as they all have a unique style of fighting so it\u2019s nice to get some variety. I just wished they pulled back with some of CGI, because they used it a lot. The soundtrack is really forgettable, as nothing really is good or special in the soundtrack. However the Opening Song is really great, and gets you ready for the upcoming episode.\\n\\n\r\nFor the characters I give them a 7. I like how they are unique and all have a pretty good reason for being the fake, making the mystery harder. I like the development for Nashetania, Fremy and Hans, the others not so much. And Adlet adds to a more unique protagonist, rather than being strong, he is just smart and likeable. However I would say his development is very minimal.\\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment. I give it a 6, because I kind of solved the mystery pretty quick and felt it was predictable, so to me it just felt like it dragged towards my answer. The action scenes are fun to watch, but the CGI can be distracting. Not to mention the ending may left me satisfied, because I was right, but it also left me bitter.\\n\\n\r\nSo for the overall score of Rokka no Yuusha, after rounding it up, I give it a 7/10. I recommend this anime to people who are looking for some good action, as there is quite a number of unique fights, but also to those who love mysteries, it might be a bit predictable, depending on who you are.",

It's something I can't handle and something I can't restrain myself from. Whenever I get cliffhangers at the end of a season, I always search for the next one. When there is, I become so pumped that I would wait until it's available on some sites! \r\nAnyways, the story was outstanding! Typically not what most of people would like. But people like us- Otakus to be exact- would enjoy it, though I'm not saying all otakus. \r\nThe Animation was nice. Sound was great. The Charactersare pretty interesting too! It's always fun when I watch this. And I just finished it in less than a few hours actually.\\n\r\nThe twist at the end was what I was surprised at. Darn Nachetanya.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude that, I think they did an amazing job!\\n\r\n#FlameLet FTW!",

            "content": "Rokka no Yuusha is an anime that stood out to me from all of the other 2015 Summer anime. Most of the anime this season were either Echii, Action, or Harem, and some a combination. Rokka no Yuusha, though brought a genre that I personally enjoy quite a lot; Mystery/Suspense. The first few episodes would lead you believe that the show is a typical show about defeating a main villain with the help of your comrades, but you will soon realize that the purpose of this show, or at least this season is to solve a mystery.\r\nOther than the Mystery genre, Rokka no Yuusha alsoincorporates good action scenes, romance scenes and even psychological scenes (somewhat). Though usually, adding too much stuff into one anime, doesn't turn out well, but in the case of Rokka no Yuusha, the anime eventually did decide on what genre was going to be its main theme, with the other attributes added in there for a better production overall.\\n\\n\r\nI will review this anime in four categories; Story, Characters, Production and Enjoyment. And I should probably mention that there are anime spoilers in this review.\\n\\n\r\nSo... Let's get started.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first the story of this show seemed to be about defeating the Demon King (oh God, that name), but it soon turned into who is the seventh brave. Though I assume that the real story is still to defeat the Demon King, but this season decided to leave that out, to create some hype of potential upcoming seasons. And I am completely OK with that. Finding out who the seventh Brave was, was the biggest reason I would watch this anime first on the days it would air. \\n\\n\r\nRokka no Yuusha for me was just the right length for the type of story that it was. And for the fact that it only focused in one conflict after the first few episodes. Suspense was built each episode, and it was possible to make predictions for each member of the seven to be the fake. There wasn't an obvious answer until the later episode, which even then wan't even close to being certain.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the 7 were likable character (with the exception of Chamot), and the final reveal would be shocking no matter who ended up being the fake. \\n\\n\r\nThe mystery component of this anime was its best. It was a witty way of going about things, and it worked really well, something I really enjoyed to watch every week.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that there were other components that were included in this anime. There was romance between Adlet and Fremy, which I found to be likable and developed just enough, for the length of this anime. There were some amazing character interactions, but I will save that for the characters section of this review. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSomething has to be exceptionally good for me to give it a 10/10. There were some vivid characters in this show and each of them were interesting in their own sense. Each of them brought an interesting component to the story, and I have no complaints in how they were handled. The ones that needed a backstory got a backstory, and the ones that were fine without one, stayed without one. A good example of anime that gave each of their characters a backstory is Akame ga Kill, in which none of the backstories were memorable, nor were they stories, just events, and the length is to blame for that. The only way to have each character have an interesting and memorable backstory is to have a long running anime, like One Piece. \\n\\n\r\nI am not going to write about each of the 7 major characters individually, because it is mostly all going to be positive critique. Instead, I will keep this short and talk about three character individually; The Biggest Idiot in The World, Half-Demon Inuyasha, and Yandere Princess.\\n\\n\r\nFirst the lead, Adlet. Some might think that Adlet is a generic hero from every other Shonen anime. But, I see Adlet as nothing more than a normal person, that is just talented and likes to boast about it to boost his confidence, very relatable for me. He calls himself \"The Strongest Man in The World\", because not only is he physically fit, but he is talented in all forms of combat. \\n\\n\r\nAdlet has trained hard to get where he got. He wasn't born talented like a lot of heroes are in Action anime, nor does he have hidden potential that he can unlock when the going gets tough. He also isn't dense and is outgoing about his feelings, (someone actually confessed in anime? Blasphemy). All this makes Adlet someone you want to cheer for, someone a lot of people can relate to and in essence a good likable character.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the love of his life, is Fremy. The half fiend born to a Fiend mother and a human father. What I like about Fremy is that she isn't a goody two shoes. She wants to achieve her ambitions and normal morality isn't going to get in her way, or so she would like us to think. She does have a soft side, which is always nice to see in characters like these. In the end through the influence of Adlet, Fremy does end up becoming a lot more softer, which is pretty much what you would call 'character development'.\\n\\n\r\nFremy's backstory was hardly explored in this season of anime, but everyone knows that it will be shown at some point in the future. As for me, I would be completely happy if it wasn't shown at all, only hinted at. This will let the viewers imagine their own perfect backstory for Fremy, which I think always works better for characters like her. One good example would be Gintoki from the anime Gintana, where his backstory is hardly explored, but everyone expects it to be legendary. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the last character that I want to talk in depth about is Nachetania. Yeah, she's a bitch. But that makes her so incredibly interesting to watch. She was my bet for the 7th brave since the time she destroyed those tablets, but seeing her deceive those guys, like some smartass, and then go Yandere on Adlet's ass, was one of the best moments this anime season.\\n\\n\r\nNachetania was sort of a likable character in the beginning of the show, but then she was the 7th brave, and you realize that you wont see her on the good side again, mixed feelings really. And you know that because of all these opinions on Nachetania, she is a well written character.\\n\r\nI would also like to mention her behavior as a princess. From a typical anime, you would expect Nachetania to be either super spoiled or super kind, but Nachetania was just super confused. She wanted good but didn't know what was bad. And her morals got a bit messed up, which again, made her interesting to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main character of this show are also very interesting likable characters, but it is going to take too long to talk about all of them. One statement I would like to say is that they were all explored just as much as they needed to be. No one was given too much boring attention and no one was given too little.\\n\\n\r\nOh and there was that other cow girl, The Saint of Blood or something. She didn't exist.\\n\\n\r\nProduction: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThere were lots of scenes in Rokka no Yuusha that were animated beautifully. They were smooth and HD, but there were a lot of scenes that were not. There was lots of inconsistency too, characters would loose their face structure every now and then. \\n\\n\r\nThere were no soundtracks that stood out in particular. They were actually below average in truth, but the anime worked fine without them. As for the Openings and Ending. Endings were ok, I didn't watch them after the first time because they didn't really catch my attention, but the first opening was amazing, and the second was very much not.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in Rokka no Yuusha was one of my favorite things about the anime. The character designs were all beautiful with the exception of Cow Girl that came in the end. This made the anime that much more worth it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe mystery from the anime was the biggest form of enjoyment when watching this show every week. But there were lots of other things, that I have already mentioned; Character Design, Characters, Action and Animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is very fun to watch. You are always left predicting who the seventh brave is by the end of each episode, while enjoying the events that transpire within the episode. Surprisingly the action in this anime, and the powers of each characters are also amazing. The powers are extremely unique, and the combat scenes are very fluid.  \\n\\n\r\nIt really is an anime everyone should watch. It isn't hard to understand but is smart at the same time. It has amazing characters, and a great mystery component. A must watch, for lovers of all genres.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Scores:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nProduction: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10",

            "content": "I am heavily biased towards fantasy anime. Reason, because I love fantasy in general, even outside of anime. So I went into Rokka no Yuusha expecting generic fantasy. As soon as the first fight scene occurred I could already tell that this was going to be interesting.\r\nAnd then the mystery kicked in. There are only six people chosen, but for some reason there are seven people there. And the show (unless you are cynical like me or you happen to spot the flaws in what a certain character says) does a really good job at keeping you guessing of who the traitor could be. I'llbe honest, at first I thought that they might through in the sort of \"but this time there the MC was chosen as a last minute surprise\" but it was actually a fake in their midst. And this is where it gets interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one type of show that I like almost as much as a fantasy, it's a thriller/mystery. Stuff like Stiens;Gate, where you know there is something wrong, but you don't know why... Then Stiens;Gate you actually figure it out and it just gets all the more gripping from there... But this is a review about Rokka no Yuusha, I shouldn't gush about Stiens;Gate... But you see the connection?\\n\\n\r\nSo... I can't really say much else about the story that I loved without spoilers, so... Maybe I'll do something elsewhere about it...\\n\\n\r\nNow the art style is what first intrigued me with this show, before even the fight scene. It's unique, unlike this animation studios... anime that shall not be named. I found it had this childish vibrancy that not only made the world look fantastical, but also made the setting that much more eerie. Also, props to being a show that does CGI fairly well (looking at you Bakamatsu Rock).\\n\\n\r\nSound. Okay... so not sure what to say about this. The background music I didn't pay much attention to, and maybe I'll go listen to the OST at some point, but the OPs were great and the EDs weren't half bad either. There was no music during the episodes though that really caught my attention... But Cry for the Truth and Black Swallowtail... freaking beautiful OPs.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters are what really make this show great. There is the MC, the man who has Naruto's enthusiasm and the fighting skills to back it up. He isn't 2D either which is great, his backstory is interesting and you can't hate him... except when he says \"Strongest Man in the World,\" for the 50th time... Then pretty much every character except two have something off about them. One is an assassin (sadly, if you know anything about mysteries it's never the one who seems the most guilty, although nothing against Hans, he's is great), the little kid with weird powers that are disgusting hte first time and a... unique personality, the silent one who is quick to judge, then the other two. I don't really know how to describe Maura and Nashetania... They were the most interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the cliffhanger right at the end. I won't say anything, but they do it so well that I want more but it didn't feel like a throwaway ending to hook us because it's unfinished (you know, like an EA game). I really don't care about this new problem they introduced at the end, I just wanna see more of these characters, AND THEY DIDN'T PULL SOMETHING REALLY STUPID AND LOCK THEMSELVES BACK IN, WHICH WAS GREAT!!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I loved this anime. I'm biased towards Fantasy and that sort of thriller/mystery vibe that it had. That's why my final rating for this anime is a Fifa/10, since it was rigged from the start (u mad soccer fans?)\\n\r\nBut legit, I give it a 9/10, because I thought it was a great anime with a rather unique concept (well, Deltora Quest lol).",

            "content": "Rokka no Yuusha is a rarity among fantasy-titles, a diamond in the rough with many uneven parts yet a worthwhile story that promises more. While we all have seen the generic premise of heroes going up against a revived demon lord before, this is mere set-up for greater things as it hooks you with its mystery and intrigue. When a traitor is revealed to be among our heroes, the show proceeds to prove itself to be one of the better examples of its genre in recent memory.\r\nIn terms of presentation the show is far from perfect. An area where the show needs to improve wouldbe the directing. Since the cast is trapped in one location for a majority of the show, it relies on info-dumps that could have been improved with flashbacks, symbolism, or creative cinematography. We\u2019re treated to animation and designs that are cool in some parts and head-scratching in others. The setting draws heavily from Aztec civilization, a fresh and exciting new sight. The fiends that threaten the world on the other hand are horrible examples of CGI-monsters that simply don\u2019t look like they belong. Thankfully the fiends are far from the focus, leaving us with a cast of unique looking characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack adds to the atmosphere of rising tension and doubt, something it accomplishes fairly well with both bombastic and chilling orchestras. During calmer moments the music steps into the background, allowing the world and characters to breathe, something most fans of fantasy and world-building will appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nUtilizing its mystery, the show has good reason to delve into each character, establishing just a bit about everyone since they need to prove themselves to be one of the heroes. Some limitations come into play since the anime only adapts the first volume of the source-material, meaning that only two characters get significant development, though it also plants clear seeds in other characters for the future. On several occasions the story takes the characters in unexpected and warmly welcome directions that go against tropes of anime, making them all the more interesting to follow.\\n\\n\r\nIf theory-crafting is ever warranted, it would be in a mystery-show, and Rokka manages to engage its audience to the maximum with great use of tension and build-up. A show that takes its time to examine the mystery and give its audience the time to get immersed and spot clues gets a big plus in my book. Despite this, the final reveal and end might leave one with mixed emotions depending on the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Rokka no Yuusha is a good starting adventure to an epic journey with room for improvement.  With characters and writing that already shows great potential it is hard to not want more. Highly recommended to fans of fantasy and twist-filled adventures.",

            "content": "*Note I'll keep this as spoiler free as I can*\r\nStory - 9/10 \r\nAs we all know, the plot of this series revolves around 6 chosen heroes all with different abilities whom are tasked with defeating the Majin whom is the ultimate evil of this series and his armies of Fiends \r\nSounds pretty generic on the outside and rightfully so it pretty much is however, this story has so much more to offer that personally it shocked the hell out of me.....One thing that the average person would expect from a fantasy/supernatural/adventure anime is the potential for good world building and character interactions and everything thatfalls under. I know for a fact that there are a lot of skeptical mindsets when it comes to LN adaptations due to the fact that a lot of studios nowadays tends to fail to properly adapt certain aspects of said novels in terms of either missed dialogue or even the skipping or rushing of scenes all together \\n\\n\r\nRokka no Yuusha surprisingly does none of that....Not only has it refrained from skipping or rushing material but it actually takes out the time to adapt every bit of dialogue whether it be internal monlogues or conversations between characters. Moreover, there is such a great attention to detail as well as information about the world, characters besides the main ones, abilities as well as background information \\n\\n\r\nBut that's not even the most surprising part....This entire season has literally revolved around something that doesn't even directly focus on the overarching plot of the story.....Usually in series such as what I just lightly mentioned doesn't even happen until much later on in the story yet alone having an entire season/volume be based around it and the great part is that its handled so freaking well!!!!! Everything from the suspense and intensity of the dialogue, straight up to the inevitable conflicts amongst the characters whether it being verbal or physical is just done to perfection.....There is another important aspect in regards to this but I will touch on that in a later segment \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, albeit the story being generic on paper, how it's handled is anything but amazing.....You would think that everything would be straightforward but boy is that the biggest and most false assumption that anyone can even imply \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis is easily the weakest part of and tbh the only major flaw that I see from this anime.....The evidence is everywhere and as such I shouldn't need to even pry on this matter however, there are some things here that are worth noting \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are all very well thought out considering that this series takes place in what seems to be like a period of early civilizations and as such the characters all look like they belong in this time period....Lastly, even though the art tends to look bad for the most part, the animation however is still pretty decent and does a good job portraying the action bits of the series. The fiends all look pretty menacing and has that creepy factor going for them as well which is also good \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nAs with the character designs the OST fits particularly well with the theme and tone of the story primarily both of the OP's which might I add, all sound beautiful. The voice acting is also pretty good and they each seem to fit their respective characters very well (Primarily Adlet, Fremy and Hans) \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the other segment that I mentioned earlier, I wanted to save it for this particular section considering that this is the icing on the cake. Like with the story, the charters themselves are the standard archtypes/generic but that's only on paper\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this story is VERY character centric and as such, there is a lot of focus on every character with some getting more focus than others for obvious reasons as you dive further into the story....Another thing is that their personalities are all very diverse primarily because of their respective backgrounds for example our MC Adlet, Fremy and Nashetania.....There isn't much development for some of these characters, but they are written in such a way that they don't really need much of it at all \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes thsee characters shine even more is the twists that they all bring about and as such, it is quite evident that everyone isn't exactly like what they are being portrayed as (On purpose might I add considering future events both in this season and beyond) and that is lovely because it adds to the suspense and intensity week after week and what makes it even better is that the characters themselves are aware of this very same thing hence why they the way they do towards each other as well as showing the dynamics between them all....Another thing that I love is that plot armor isn't much of a factor here and nobody is truly invincible or that overpowered so the fear of shit hitting the fan is pretty high\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nFor all of the reasons above....I am a sucker for this kind of story and to not only see every aspect being handled so well but have insane plot twists combined with the great character interactions and the characters themselves being very interesting in general all wrapped up in a very thrilling, mysterious and suspenseful plot is just wonderful....Also each character is impressive battle wise in their own unique and creative ways which is a huge plus for me considering that they all had to earn their strength \\n\\n\r\nI want to give this series a 10/10 but taking my inner fanboy away, this is the most well deserved 9/10 that I've given to a seasonal anime in a long time",

But if you want me to rate these three it's be \r\n1.Fushigi Yuugi\r\n2.Akatsuki no Yona\r\n3.Rokka no Yuusha \r\nI really like the character design and art of this anime, if you notice Nashetania (the rabbit girl) hair braid end was shape to look like a rabbit tail, i like how they thought of such creativestuff! \\n\\n\r\nBut, butttt I hate how the protagonist keeps saying that how he is the strongest person in the world and all, again and again ever so constant. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to mock about this anime is that how silly some of their names are: Flammie Speedraw?

It had me sitting on the edge of my seat, and my mind working as hard as it could to find which was the Fake Brave.End in the end, I was more than surprise with the answer.\r\nApart from the plot, thecharacters are all extremely interesting and totally different.I am in total LOVE with Fremy (is this who it's spelled??), definetly my favorite character of all time!!\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, Rokka is a clear 10/10 show and a Must-Watch for all.",

            "content": "This is not a mystery anime. Despite what people say about this anime, it's is not a mystery anime. If I was judging this as a mystery anime, then it would get a 1, which is pretty disappointing because  I really liked the idea of this anime. If this was a mystery anime, then they wouldn't have spent 3 episodes shoving the same backstory down our throats and waiting til the 4th episode to reveal the mystery. And then they wouldn't have spent 70% of the time after fighting instead of solving the mystery.\r\nStory: 7 \r\nHonestly the story isn't bad. I liked the premiseof it, but it was poorly executed. The first few episodes did nothing but shoved the backstory down our throats repeatedly, and after that basically came to a standstill where nothing happened but searching for clues. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nThe art isn't anything special, but it would have gotten a 7 if they didn't try to be so fancy with the camera. It felt like they did a lot of the camera animation just to prove that they could. For example, in the scene when the \"braves\" all gather for the first time, they are all in a circle and the camera in the center spinning around. That would make sense if everyone was talking, but only 2 people had anything to say, and it was rather nauseating to watch. But other than the camera work, the art was alright. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6 \\n\r\nThe sound wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that memorable either. But I'm not much of an audiophile so I'll leave this part short. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5 \\n\r\nThere are seven total main character for this show for a 12 episode anime. You're only introduced to 4 before the 4th episode, which would be fine if there was any character development at all. There wasn't however, so I ended up not caring about any of them. After all the characters are introduced there is some character development, but only for the only interesting character in the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3 \\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this anime much. I guessed the answer to the mystery on the 2nd episode, and tried to pick up clues for the rest of the anime implicating that character as the 7th \"brave\", but unfortunately there was only 1 clue that led to solving the mystery, and it was shown at the very end. So the anime was more frustrating to watch than it was enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nIf you spend any time at all thinking about who might be the 7 \"brave\" based on the fact that this is an anime and meant to entertain, then it's really easy to guess who the 7 \"brave\" is. The reveal was also disappointing, as there was nothing leading up to it and there was only 1 clue that was revealed at the end.\\n\\n\r\nBut as I said, this is not a mystery anime, so I judged it as an action anime. As an action anime it still wasn't very good though. The camera was poorly animated at times, the music wasn't very exceptional, and there was almost no character development to speak of.",

It looked like some generic fantasy anime with some fanservice and no plot. By the fourth episodes, it turned into one of the most thrilling anime this season. It started boring but the mystery element and the cliffhangers, made the viewers excited for the upcoming episode. What made this anime unpopular is that it's adapted from a light novel, which is written by Ishio Yamagata. We know for the last couple of years, light novel adaptations werenot the best, of course there's exclusions. The first couple of episodes, 1-4, showed us that light novel adaptations are still suffering. But it turned the table after the fourth episode. People wanted to know who is the seventh and every episode made us change our mind about who is the seventh. Characters were not just one-dimensional character that serve no other purpose than being there and has no development whatsoever. The characters undergo some huge developments especially Fremy. Passione (studio) did a good job animations. It wasn't the best but it surely ranks above average. Nothing unique about the soundtrack. They were average. This anime has its flaws, but the good parts cover it and made me wait for the next Saturday just to watch a new episode. The ending however, left us with a big cliffhanger that will make you want to start reading the novels. If there's no second season, then this anime was just like No Game No Life, which was made just to advertise the light novels.\\n\r\n-Short version\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Thrilling and very interesting\\n\r\n-Characters are not one-dimensional or dense\\n\r\n-The mystery element makes you excited for each new episode\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Average soundtrack\\n\r\n-Started bad and slow\\n\r\nHave a nice weekend MAL community!",

            "content": "This is a very interesting anime, although it did disappoint me greatly as I continued watching it. \r\nThe story starts out great... Then just tumbles down into this, plotless mess. The first few episodes had me SO hooked. I was loving the MC and Nachetanya dressing up as a maid then revealed to be the princess. And then... It became a mystery. \"Who is the 7th?\" became the last half of the anime. Nothing more happened. I thought I was watching an adventure fantasy, but I was wrong. The non-developing plot was SO slow and extremely dragged out, I was quite tired watching it. \r\nTheart is quite pretty. Character designs are very interesting, and I thought it fit the anime well... For the first half, anyway. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite was the sound. Personally, the openings and endings were absolutely astounding. It fit the adventure/fantasy-ness of the anime so well, and were extremely catchy. Chord spellings are eargasmic and those strings are amazing. I hated skipping the OP, because it was just SO epic. Also, the OST was breathtaking. It was like watching a hollywood movie. The orchestral background music was incredibly epic, and I still love listening to it to this day. This is one of the few animes where the soundtrack was driving me to continue the series. I cannot stress this enough, but the soundtrack is a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, that's really all there is to say about this anime... Sound was one of the most compelling things for me. The rest was pretty ok, so I thought this anime was fair overall. \\n\\n",

            "content": "First of all, I would recommend people to watch the anime first and then read the review.\r\nAnimation: The animation was top notch most of the time though in some scenes it was really bad.\r\nSound: The OST's fit the anime perfectly so no complain there.\r\nArt: Like the art style so again no complain there.\r\nCharacters: Character development was good but not perfect because there are some characters who got little screen time and some characters whose background wasn't highlighted compare to some other characters.\r\nStory: Now, here comes the main part. Rokka no Yuusha wasn't your typical action, fantasy anime rather it's an action, fantasy anime withmystery hugely involved. In short, There are six heroes who has to save the world from beings called 'Fiends'. Now, here is the tricky part, though there can only be six heroes, it appears that there was seven who was a fake one. Now, the whole 12 Episodes concentrates about finding the fake Brave/Hero. It sounds boring, doesn't it? But it's not and that is what I like about this anime. It's not typical rather it's odd but has it's own significance. But still it seems a little simple to call it has its significance, doesn't it? I mean, only finding fake brave doesn't make it a good show. Now here's the twist, in the last episode after finding the fake brave, there was another brave appeared. Wait what? So, the previous fake brave wasn't actually fake? Well, the answer is, the previous fake brave was actually fake but it appears to be there are two fake braves. Well, that's all the 12 Episodes has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nNow, here's the significance. After finishing the series I check out the spoilers about afterwards and there's the significance was hiding. So, if you check the spoilers, check at your own risk. So, in the end to me, clearly it was one the rarest type of anime in years and (very good) categorized of 2015. And, one last note, if this doesn't get a season 2, all the good thing that I was talking about the Story would be lost. At the moment I would keep my fingers crossed.",

            "content": "I really enjoyed Rokka. Most people I can see not really enjoying this show but for me it was a pleseant surprise how invested to see where the show was going. In all honesty the story was a tad predictable and I have no problems with that because my overall enjoyment was very high. The action set pieces are beautifully animated and are exciting and fast paced. I cannot wait for season 2. If I had an issue with the show I will admit the characters are hit and miss I really like some characters like Hans, Flamie and Adlet and then there are justcharacters I either dispise or are given little to no screen time to get to know them better. Goldov is the best example of a character that did absolutely nothing in this show. He very rarely talks and doesn't do much beyond standing around. It's a wasted potential that I feel they could have done more for him. But all in all with issues to the side I did have fun. I watched it to be entertained with a intersting mystery solving story and it's fun in that regard. I'd say check out Rokka and if you don't like it then probably just drop the series. I think it gets really captivating by episode 5 which generally happens in most anime.",

            "content": "Ever watch the first episode of an anime, really like it and hope it stays like that? Rokka no Yuusha is NOT one of those anime, however even though the show comes to a complete stop and heads in an entirely new direction early on, It went down that new road very successfully. Most anime that have a drastic change don\u2019t really fare well but ROkka no Yuusha just runs with it. Its almost refreshing to see it step away from a traditional fantasy adventure and focus much more heavily on the mystery present throughout the show. \r\nStory-8\r\nThe story is set on a fictional continentwhere magic and fantasy are the norm. The continent seems to have many other countries and varied landscapes yet the anime spends most of its time at the edge of it. At the far west end of the continent is the Balca Peninsula or Demon Territory. Our two main protagonists, Adlet and Nachetanya, are tasked to go there and meet up with the other braves to repel the demon threat. According to legend, hundreds of years ago demons would plague the land and the only one with enough power to defeat them was the Saint of the Single Flower. Ever since The Saint had slain the demons only twice have they been resurfaced since. The previous times the Demons were banished by the Rokka No Yuusha, which were prophesized by the Saint of the Single Flower to return and defeat the demons. Apparently they are chosen by proving themselves to the Goddess of Fate, which I am unsure is the same person as the Saint of the Single Flower. Lots of the legend is still left a mystery throughout the show but thats really what the show is all about, mystery. Why is it so damn foggy? Why do the demons keep coming back? Side-boob or Underboob? Does Jet Fuel Melt steel beams?! How many braves ARE there!? Plenty of questions arise and the anime does a good job at answering them, for the most part. The entire mystery of the show if figuring out who the imposter is among the braves. A answer which is not revealed until the very end. The story that starts of as an action adventure quickly turns into a mystery show but don\u2019t worry, there is still plenty of action left in the second half of the show. The pure hysteria between the group has everyone on edge looking for clues as to who doesn\u2019t belong and the entire time the show will have you wondering who the 7th brave is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 7\\n\\n\r\nBig points the character designer for this one. Flamie, Nachetanya, and Adlet all have interesting designs that really make them stick out. Although I\u2019ve go to admit Flamie is one of the stupidest names for a character Ive ever heard. I really used to hate her as a character, Kuuderes just dont float my boat. It is nice that she does get some more of her background revealed so it makes a little more sense that she acts the way she does. She is almost TOO calm and collected if that makes sense. Extra points for her actually having a gun in a fantasy anime. She is by far the most mysterious character out of the group. Next is Adlet. At first he just comes off as another Overpowered fuckboy protagonist always spouting off about being the \u201cStrongest man in the world\u201d which was a little annoying but as the story progresses he became easily the most likeable character aside from those that really liked Flamie. Unlike the others that have some sort unique power or strength, Adlet fights using much more unconventional means like using smoke grenades, throwing needles, a small sword, and some really cool fire braces that don\u2019t make sense to me but are still badass. Then theres Nachetanya, the Princess of the Largest Kingdom, Her bodyguard Goldov thats 16. (yah fuckin right). Hans the token cat character that I thought I would hate but was actually pleasantly surprised from later on. Chamo the true fuckboy\u2026 girl\u2026 I dont even know. Who decides its a good idea to have all these little kids become gods among men. Its a toddler not a damn MMA fighter. Why these loli characters exist still baffles me. Then theres Mora Chester. And we definiely want more of her chester. Shes the saint of the mountains and I wouldn\u2019t doubt her seeing as shes got twin peaks herself\u2026 ok Im done now. All in all the cast isnt that great but Adlet, Flamie, Hans, and even Nachetanya in a sense make the anime very interesting. Since most of them still have quite a lot of mystery to them it is anyone\u2019s guess as to who the imposter is. The reactions and reasoning behind why they think someone is suspect leads to great tension throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 9  / Sound 8\\n\\n\r\n Animation in this show is beautiful and its a shame that the earlier cityscapes and wilderness are not shown very much past the beginning few episodes. As stated before all the characters look great and the show uses its pretty visuals bring the world to life. In the beginning when the story of the Saint of the Single Flower was told in a unique artistic way utilizing what looks to be more like wall paintings rather than the style used i the rest of the anime, which worked great for telling the old legends. The fight scenes are fluid, the colors are vibrant in the beginning and much more gritty towards the middle and end, the atmosphere is very foggy as most of the show takes place in a foggy forest area but what better way to set the atmosphere for a mystery show than that? A lot of the show is fog but there are plenty of scenes where the backgrounds are very eyecatching. As for soundtrack the show has some good OP\u2019s and ED\u2019s that only add tension to the show as well as backing up every fight or chase scene with intense and driving music. Nothing really sticks out from the track per se but it does do a great job at keeping the show tense and mysterious. It doesn\u2019t stick out but it is definitely there, subtly adding more and more mysterious elements to the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8\\n\\n\r\nI keep saying it but the theme with this show is tension. Throughout the second half every situation could mean life or death and with anime becoming more bold, it seems that nobody could be safe from death. It feels like this show has just barely scratched the surface of its world and it feels like there is so much more to it than was presented in the anime. Hopefully this show gets another season cause I would love to see how the journey progresses. I was pleasantly surprised by this show coming from a young animation studio and I would say that It is definitely worth checking out.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score 8\\n\\n\r\nWatch this! Possibly the best anime of the season\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Since I first saw the concept art of this anime I was hooked. I didn't even know the story or anything I just knew I loved how it looked and directly added it to my plan to watch list.\r\nNow that I completed it in a day(even if I told myself I will take it slow since I have no free time), I can finally review it and share with you my opinion on this one. Full review with pics :http://thewritinghut.net/rokka-no-yuusha-review/\r\nStory:\r\nI did not expect a 12 episode show to be concerned with such a small plot. Like this story is basically only one tiny portion ofwhat the world of our six heroes looks like. There are indeed a lot of emotions filled in and a lot of crazy events happen during the span of a month maybe a bit more or less, can't really tell to be honest.\\n\r\nThe plot twist is something one should be impressed by, because this anime just brings a very interesting storyline that you just can't predict.\\n\\n\r\nLet me cut down to the chase, it's the classical \"X Heroes are chosen by a God to defeat the Demon Lord\" but trust me when I say this, you won't get bored!\\n\r\nYes it is an overused theme in this genre but then again we like it like that. We like to have some random people group together and save a fictional world.  But the thing is about this that the story is a lot more complex.\\n\r\nIndeed it did have the start with an anti-hero good guy character that's just too cocky for his own good, and to be frank I have the hots for anti-hero kind personalities so I can't help it but like the way this went.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway you should expect the unexpected in those 12 crazy episodes.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAdlet \"The World's Strongest\" Mayer - The first person we are introduced to. Most people refer to him as the biggest idiot while he claims to be The Strongest Person in the World. A very kind individual with a cunning brain and a neck for causing trouble for everyone. He is the anti-hero type of personality who does things that are not really common for a hero. Really cool guy in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nNashetania Loei Piena Augustra - Second character we meet, the Princess of some kingdom. Rather a generic character with huge \"personality\" and an unstable one as well. She is new to all of this kind of thing and is a bit scared and stuff like that but she is really powerful. Anyway this character is probably one of the only characters I dislike in this how. Why? Well I would spoil everything if I told you that.\\n\\n\r\nFremy Speeddraw - Best girl of this show. The cold blooded gunman amongst the heroes and the one that is surrounded by darkness. Unemotional and really aggressive, but Adlet somehow still accepts her as a fellow hero.\\n\\n\r\nThose 3 are the most important characters in my opinion and not to spoil anything I will not write too much about the other 4 main characters who will show up in this show. The thing is the character design is really interesting, we have those few heroes who are generic at their best but we still can see that something about them is unique and interesting, there is something that just wants you to continue watching Rokka no Yuusha.\\n\r\nYes they are mostly generic characters you find in an RPG character creation but still there are some unique features to those characters that make them seem alive, not real but alive. By alive I mean characters that are actually interesting not just some copy past type of chars.\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nI told you I was hooked to this show just because of the art. There are really amazing scenes and the anime is just pure gold when it comes to the animation and the artwork. But that was to expected from Pony Canyon and  Passione, common they are great!\\n\\n\r\nThere is really no complain about the animation to be honest, he battle scenes were very interesting and the details were ecstatic.\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest I wasn't really amazed by the opening or ending songs, but the background music and the characters voices fit so I guess it was ok. Nothing more to say here move on.\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\n\"I want a second season right now and if they don't bring it out right now I will force them to make it\" is how I feel about this series. Not even going overboard with that description, I just want to know what will happen next, will they defeat the Demon Lord, will someone die, will someone else fall in love with each other?\\n\r\nAnyway it's just a fantastic show that takes you in a interesting world, but only for a short period of time, yet that short period of time is enough to hook you to it. I would kinda like it to be in Adlets shoes to be honest, he seems to have a interesting life...but well I'd have to go outside so..yeah not gonna happen (just kidding tho I'd love to trade places).\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "STORY:\r\nI'm not really going to go over the background of the story. You can get the gist of it in a few seconds based off of the page for Rokka no Yuusha on this site. I'm just going to head straight into my opinion.\r\nThe story was surprisingly good, even if it turned out to be more of a \"locked room\" type mystery instead of a roaming adventure quest. In fact, I actually really enjoyed that it was a locked room mystery. I have seen a lot of mysteries that have included locked rooms but this, by far, is THE most unique and original spin onthat. Instead of \"who is the murderer\", you have a \"who is the imposter\" in an extremely high stakes guessing game, where the seventh is a deceiving traitor. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of guessing, this anime was masterful at hiding who the imposter is. The only person who you are CERTAIN isn't the imposter is the main character, Adlet Mayer, because you follow him throughout the entirety of his journey so far. Everyone else seems like a suspect and an innocent at the same time. There are reasons floating in your mind about why you should doubt a certain person's character or truthfulness, but at the same time you aren't certain. I had no way of figuring out who the imposter was until the reveal, and well - I won't ruin that for you. \\n\\n\r\nThe only reason that I rated the story as a seven and not an eight or a nine is because I noticed one massive plot hole at the beginning of the anime. Adlet Mayer wants to make Fremy come along with him almost immediately after he meets her, so he steals her bag of bullets and gives her no choice but to follow him by saying that her gun is useless without her bullets. Except that it's pretty obvious she doesn't need it, because, well... her ability is that she can create bullets and gunpowder out of thin air. If I am wrong about that somehow, please message me and explain, but I'm pretty sure that they screwed up bad at that little part. I can't BELIEVE that they made that big of a mistake. They should have had him steal the gun instead.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that plot hole, the story is well made. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nART:  The art was fantastic. The fighting was beautifully animated, the characters were beautifully animated. It all looked beautiful. 9/10. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The soundtracks aren't too memorable, but they aren't bad in any way. They use a lot of stringed instruments in their soundtracks, which I enjoy as a violinist. Sound effects were nicely made. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: \\n\\n\r\nI actually really enjoyed the characters. I gave this an eight and not a higher score because I thought Goldov wasn't fleshed out very well. Besides him, they were quite well made and all had aspects that I thought were quite charming in some way. \\n\\n\r\nAdlet Mayer, who confidently proclaims he is \"the strongest man in the world\", is a character that I liked. Although at times he was a bit dopey about how strong he is - which reminded me of Naruto at the beginning of his own series - he could really back up how strong he was. He is extremely clever, perceptive, and fights people with EXTREMELY powerful abilities using his tricks and wits. The man wasn't chosen as one of the six braves for nothing. He also has a nice personality. He's caring and loyal to those who stick with him, but he isn't a fool and knows when to stay on his toes in the case that someone is turned against him. \\n\\n\r\nFremy/Flamie (however you spell it) was an intriguing character whose motives, backstory, and character easily made her one of my favorites. Explaining any of it in detail would be a massive spoiler. I can expand upon her ability, which deals with creating gunpowder, bullets, and explosives out of thin air. I thought her ability, and how she used it, was extremely fun and enjoyable to watch. Aoi Yuuki did a FANTASTIC job voicing her. \\n\\n\r\nNachetanya/Nachetania was an alright character. Although I didn't like her personality all that much at certain points, she had one of my favorite abilities in the entire series. She uses a wand to control blades at will, which can be constructed in any shape or form that she wishes. Who knew that you could control blades so elegantly? One of the weirder things about her is that she has bunny ears, which I suppose is either her hair or part of a head piece - as it's pretty clear they are not real because she didn't have them in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nHans Humpty was a great character. The man has a ridiculously great name (Hans HUMPTY, everybody), and he acts like a cat and has a fake cat tail because he admires them so much. He's an assassin that was chosen as one of the six braves because he is such a badass. His skills with blades are no joke, and his acrobatic movements are nothing but pure fun to watch. He is also arguably the most intelligent and perceptive person in the series, and also the slyest. At the very beginning I disliked him, but he grows on you quick. \\n\\n\r\nChamot is one of those characters that seem really cute and innocent from her appearance, but she is absolutely terrifying. She looks about nine, but she is really fourteen years old - dressed like a child - and she certainly acts like one. Although she is childish, she loves to fight and stresses multiple times that she wants to torture someone - usually Adlet or Fremy. Her powerful is pretty strange, but not bad at all. She carries around a green cat-tail plant which she uses to make herself puke, which spills out strangely colorful beings that are invincible to any attacks. Yeah, she has a swamp of creatures in her stomach, which I have to admit is pretty awesome and something I have never seen before in an anime.  I'll be honest, I have a huge weak spot for cute characters that are extremely strong and have a few screws loose. I liked her.\\n\\n\r\nMaura is alright. She annoys me for spoiler-ish reasons, mainly from her actions that she carried out. She is one of those serious leader-type characters, and is the only person that could ever hope to control Chamot. She has the power of the mountain, which gives her amazing strength. For some reason, her power is shown as yellow pixels, which makes it look like she is a computer program, but I'm not complaining about it. I really like how it looks. \\n\\n\r\nThe only one who seemed pretty bland was Goldof, who really had no more characterization than \"loyal, overprotective bodyguard\". Seriously, after the anime was over, the only thing I can tell you about him is that he is a fantastic fighter, loyal and protective of Nashetanya, and is sixteen. This is also something minor, but his armor is kind of useless if you think about it. He has a helmet and some armor on his shoulders, but he leaves his stomach completely exposed. Why on earth would any self respecting bodyguard/soldier wear armor on his shoulders but not on his stomach, where important vitals are? \\n\\n\r\nOverall, great characters. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to enjoyment, it's not hard to please me. I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery, the action, the characters, and the world that it was set in. 10/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nThe average of the story (7), art (9), sound (8), characters (8), enjoyment (10) gives it an overall score of 8.4. Not bad at all. \\n",

            "content": "Where to begin.. Oh Man. I wanted to like it, i really did. This review is going to attempt to be fair, but as you can tell from me giving this a 5, i didn't truly enjoy it.\r\nWell let's start\r\nIn the begging we have a hero who wants to be a part of the 6 heroes that will destroy the demon lord. I feel like i have seen this before. Anyways, these heroes all need to travel to the demon lords domain and defeat him! Except, not. As in the description these heroes get stuck at a temple. Except there is 7, so by goodassumption one of them is the fake. This is where I started to not enjoy myself.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe background for this show and the history of the charters are well thought out. As they explain their history you can nod in contempt and approve. The problem is.... the rest of the story. There is almost 0 plot development TO THE MAIN Premise of this show. As you can assume, we find out who the 7th brave is. How ever during that journey the world stops. I mean literally stops. They get so caught up with finding out who the 7th is, that the whole demon lord idea is tossed out the window until the last episode where they FINALLY get to continue their journey. No more Fiends, no more anything. They are just there for 8 episodes figuring out whodunit. \\n\\n\r\nIt turned from stopping the demon lord to a game of finding who stabbed whats his face with a knife in the kitchen. This story could be written many different ways, how ever the way it was written left me thinking \"When are they going to progress into killing the demon lord?\"\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork started off in the first episode as something eye catching. Looking at the stars thinking \"wow, some of them are twinkling and growing\" or \"The detail to the movements of the people in the cell listening to the story is a nice touch\" but as we went deeper.... the artwork started to fade. It remained acceptable throughout the series but, nothing like the first couple of episodes. There are moments when the artwork kicks back it but it just is not as constant.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds where nice. Nothing too noteworthy however. They tend to use the same unchanging sounds for some effects, while others change infrequently.  Overall, nothing amazing, but it wasn't poor either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nOh... man. \\n\r\n\"I'm the strongest man in the world!\" - if i had a nickle for every god damn time.... *flips table*\\n\\n\r\nAnyways. This catch phrase isn't just used at good moments by the main character, it's said almost ever. damn. episode. Minor pet peeve but lets continue\\n\\n\r\nI am going to break this down into 2 things. \\n\\n\r\n1)\\n\r\nCharacter personalities:\\n\r\nMost of these personalities are very cut and dry with no real depth.\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nWe have the strong silent type with a bad history.\\n\r\nSpeeddraw, Fremy.\\n\\n\r\nSomething bad happened in her history which drove her to need to kill the demon lord. You find out what it is later.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nSome flashbacks into her past would have been nice. Alas we literally see nothing about her past, we only hear the stories.\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nWe have the main character with typical traumatizing event that made him who he is today.\\n\r\nMayer, Adlet.\\n\\n\r\nWhat usually drives someone to be the strongest in the world, when they had something happen to them in the past? You can most likely guess it without having to watch the show. Starting off the series with him facing two extremely strong opponents AT THE SAME TIME we start to assume \"Man, this guy is a badass\". Too bad the rest of the series he spends his time looking like he is at the end of his rope, the burst of energy is lost in the rest of the series as he basically turns helpless.\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nNormal protagonist style character. protect the girls, protect everyone, I'm going to be the best. \\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nWe have the only interesting character (In my opinion) who talks like a cat and i couldn't peg his personality at all.\\n\r\nHumpty, Hans\\n\r\nThis, this guy i loved. Spontaneous, random, interesting movements and quirks. His character blossoms in the series as your opinion about him changes almost every other episode. He helps our protagonist, he hurts him, he supports him, he attacks him, this guy is all over the place. however as the series goes on, you get to understand on connect more with him.\\n\r\nOverall 7.9/10\\n\r\nNot a normal character and very charismatic and memorable.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nWe have the princess who doesn't know any better.\\n\r\nPiena Augustra, Nashetania Loei\\n\\n\r\nGreen behind the ears to fighting this girl willingly RUNS OFF with adlet to go fight but gets nervous before fighting ever happens.\\n\r\nWith all the screen time she gets in the first 3 episodes it's not a surprise she disappears in the rest of the episodes. Quite honestly i feel like she had the potential to be a fantastic character, but it was wasted. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot go into detail without spoilers, so i wont. \\n\r\noverall 6.5/10\\n\r\nDecent background, okay supporting roll. Nothing will strike you as memorable except for her BDSM style of clothing. What? Not like i am complaining about it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nWe have the murder happy loli.\\n\r\nNot much about this characters past is given. main supporting roll\\n\r\nOverall Na/10\\n\r\nHard to rank a standard supporting roll, she does her job as a character fine and you wont forget about her attacks or powers. i can tell you that much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nWe have the manipulative Captain type.\\n\r\nbasically the mis-understood antagonist of the series.  You will spend most of your time wondering why she isn't dead yet, from your hate for her.\\n\r\nNo real history of her past. Mainly a supporting roll, really want's to kill the lead character.\\n\r\nOverall 6.1/10\\n\r\nSlightly above average as she managed to piss me off with her actions. Which means something about the character was done well. Power is hugely demonstrated once but then never reaches those feats ever. The first time was just for the shock and awe factor. Sad...\\n\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nAnd we have the loyal guard. \\n\r\nthis guy ... barely gets any screen time at all, and seems to have an interesting past with the princess.\\n\\n\r\nThat was never touched upon. Ever.\\n\\n\r\noverall Na/10\\n\\n\r\nMainly useless supporting character. Unable to rank\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\r\n2)\\n\r\nCharacter or Relationship Development:\\n\r\nThis touches more upon how our characters evolved from the start to the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest... there isn't much here to talk about. \\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist advances on 1 front, love. However... this is kinda rammed down our throats. A direct quote from the series\\n\\n\r\n\"For a long time... Well, since yesterday anyway.\" ... \"I love you\"\\n\\n\r\nREALLY?! REALLY?! *facedesk*\\n\\n\r\nOther than that there is only 1 character who advances in her personality. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment went from\\n\r\n\"Wow, those two will make a great ship to sail\"\\n\r\nto\\n\r\n\"Wait, wtf happen to my ship\"\\n\r\nFrom\\n\r\n\"Yea let's stop the demon thingy!\"\\n\r\nto\\n\r\n\"Uh,... so we aren't stopping the demon thingy?\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you rank the series on a per episode basis, then it would be different. Each episode left me happy. However walking away from the series i kinda felt.... like this series just left no mark. There wasn't anything special. I also felt like i didn't advance in the main story. I felt like i just watched a bunch of naruto filler episodes and at the last episode we finally continued the main story. \\n\\n\r\nnot to mention the kick in the nuts on ep 12. You'll notice it. Trust me.\\n\\n\r\noverall 5/10\\n\r\nIt's nothing to write home about. It's nothing all that amazing overall. Each episode will make you happy but in the end you will feel kinda disappointed.\\n",

            "content": "This is one of my favorite series from Summer 2015. It is a very nice blend of fantasy and mystery and does a great job of keeping us at the edge of our seat guessing the solution all the way to the end. The story is based on a group of Braves that must save the world by defeating the demon god. There are supposed to be six braves, but once they gather together we end up with seven. This season deals with finding who the traitor is, in kind of a locked-room mystery.\r\nThere is plenty of action while the mystery is being solved, whichprovides a nice balance to keep us entertained. Also, there is a tiny bit off romance thrown in there and of course some comic relief. \\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite things about this show is the art, and this is the reason for the overall score being 9 instead of 8. I love the style they use in the art, and the animation is impeccable too. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, the characters are interesting and provide the story with depth. The quirks and characteristics of each of the players in the mystery make this a special show. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, as I was watching this my biggest fear was that once we found out about the solution we were not going to be satisfied with the logic behind it. Luckily, this wasn't the case, and I have to be honest, that made me really happy. I would say that if you enjoy mysteries, this is a series you cannot miss!",

            "content": "Imagine you're 13, it's recess, and you're with your posse of friends. \r\n(Half of you don't even need to pretend ayyyy lmaoooooooooo)\r\nSo anyways you're out playing Naruto or some stupid stuff like you roleplayers do when all of the sudden you see the weird kid that's in the corner of class following your squad.\r\n(Tbh that kid is most likely you and your otaku trash lifestyle being funded by your parents that are about done with your emo crap)\r\n You want him to buzz off, but can't say it straight to his face, so you make him play some stupid character like Sasuke. Just kidding, you'retoo much of an elitist to let anyone else but you be Sasuke. But seriously, comment the wimpiest character in Naruto, cuz Idk crap about it.\\n\\n\r\nI wonder how many people I've offended so far in this blog. What was I even talking about? Oh yeah, ROKKA NO YUUSHA!\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nThe story of Rokka no Yuusha is basically the analogy of 'role playing during recess, except you barely know the people that are playing and only six can play. So when seven people want to play, you guys come up with some retarded excuse that one of the seven is a murderer and must be killed.\\n\\n\r\nLet me get something straight outta the way: don't watch this show! You'll begin the show expecting something cool, like fighting the demon king, but guess what? 4 episodes into the show, all seven of the six heroes meet up and spend the ENTIRE REST of the show in the witch trials accusing each other of being a witch. Spoiler alert, it's Chamot. You're welcome, now you don't have to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThat sneaky slut.\\n\\n\r\nThat reminds me, they did an awful job at explaining just what Rokka no Yuusha exactly IS. It begins as a generic adventure fantasy where they fight demons on their way to fight the demon lord, but halfway decides to become an edgy mystery?\\n\\n\r\nJust what is this?\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThough there's technically 7 main characters, Adlet Mayer is the one we focus on the most. To be honest, Adlet was the main reason why I got through those 4 epsiodes. I thought his creative fighting style using weapons, poisons, and no Saint skills at all was pretty legit, so I kept watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's kawaii-usagi-chan, aka the main reason I watched the show in the first place, but realized how cancerous she was. Also, she's  completely not suspicious at all.\\n\\n\r\nThen we got swashbuckler pirate, Fremy who no matter how many times I see her, reminds me of Boba Fett. ARG MATIES\\n\\n\r\nI forgot the knights'  name, but I remember that he was the biggest white knight I've ever seen. However, they made his armor black because chicks dig that emo nice guy.\\n\\n\r\nChamot is a slut\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, Hans. When this guy first appeared into the show, I automatically hated him and immediately suspected him of being the seventh brave. However, that was until he was the first person to believe Adlet wasn't the seventh and supported him. Hans is pretty chill-nya!\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least is Maura, my absolute least favorite character of this series. The whole entire time she was on screen, she was accusing someone of being an imposter. Seriously, that shiz gets old Maura. I don't care if she's one of the six Braves or not, I want her dead.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\r\nIf you already didn't guess, you should know that the animation of this show, or rather the art work, is odd and not the best I've seen. Put simply, it could use some work.\\n\\n\r\nI'll agree that the backgrounds and scenery were well-done. What I find extremely lacking is the animation that matters the most when telling a story, the characters. Studio Passion\u00e9 did pretty decent, until they got to the characters. Holy cow, there were scenes where I just wanted to gag when I saw their faces.\\n\\n\r\nIf also like to take a moment to focus on the computer animation. It's like they're using an animation program from five years ago. Hello? Etotama and Saekano did it decently, so why can't you? Then again, this may just be an issue of money and how this studio lacks the funds to make their CG look bearable.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC:\\n\r\nNow the music; THE MUSIC! I'd like to give them props for being creative with the openings and adding a variety, but the music overall was pretty average, and that's me being kind about it. Why? Simply because the ending music was cancerous. Also, the background music during the actual episode, if there was any, was hardly noticeable and didn't stand out at all.\\n\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nNow, everything I've said so far may point to you assuming I didn't like this show, but honestly, I liked it a lot. I may just be salty about it not continuing for more than 12 episodes. The whole mystery genre isn't new, but the way they executed it made the show quite interesting to keep up with for 3 months. Though if I could complain about one thing with the mystery aspect is that they include those final left hooks that we don't see coming because they never mention it at all in previous episodes. Nonetheless, Rokka no Yuusha was a pretty interesting show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Rokka no Yuusha is an interesting 12 episode mystery anime. However, don't watch this show if you expect a concrete ending: the show ends at a point where a second season is possible, but most likely isn't happening because of the lack of an announcement or the reliable sales of the first season to support a season 2. If you'd like to try by yourself to find out the identity of the seventh brave, give this show a shot, but don't expect any plot development with slaying the demon king at all \ud83d\udc4c\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Rokka no Yuusha, if seen from it's surface, is pretty straightforward. A band of heroes go to stop an evil to save the world. But underneath that simple synopsis, a lot of unexpected twists and turns come along the way, and separates this from your typical anime/novel.\r\n-Review for both the novel and anime, mild SPOILER ALERT-\r\nStory: 8.5/10\r\nRokka no Yuusha is easily now one of my favorite series. The author gives a great and exciting telling of the action, and the unexpected plot twists are very, very good. It leads you to believe something, only to find out that there are a lot of other factorsinvolved. While there are somewhat mild ass-pulls every now and then, it's mostly because they were hinted very subtly beforehand, making you focus on the happenings in the present.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime's art is awesome. The animation is high quality, and while you can see that they're not extravagant on big action scenes, it's enough to keep you excited. The MesoAmerican-Fantasy setting is very nice as well, and refreshing. While it doesn't draw you into the world that much, it's enough to be a believable world where the characters live in. Although I do understand that the quality drops midway due to budget cuts, but it's still acceptable and delivers during important scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.8/10\\n\r\nThe characters are well written, each of them feels alive with their own wishes and wills. The small, subtle, yet important hints of character relationship developments, the focus on certain characters per arc, and the distinct personalities of the characters, so you may not understand some of the things happening because of the limitations of the first season. I laugh every time because the team is highly dysfunctional. You'd expect them to get along and go with their goal, but no, a lot of conflicts happen along the way, slowly building up the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI very much enjoyed Rokka no Yuusha. I'm currently fanboying over it, and it's been leaving me at the edge of my seat recently. And don't be mean to Rolonia~\\n\r\nAdletxFremy tho",

            "content": "Rokka No Yuusha is the story about an ancient Maya-like land, where every 300 years the demon god wakes from his slumber to destroy humanity, but the place's god chooses 6 brave heroes to fight him. This year 7 heroes appeared and one of them is a traitor, the question is... who?\r\nThis anime was just a masterpiece for everybody who loves mystery and fantasy genres. I swear I spent the whole series making theories about who the seventh was... I never could've guessed the answer tho. I just gotta say that (personally) this one was my favourite anime from this season even if I didn'tgive it the highest rate. And why did I do that you may ask... that's becouse I felt like it was kind of slow at times and there were lot's of episodes wasted on unnecessary chatter.. In my last review I complained about Charlotte falling too short, well, Rokka No Yuusha is all the opposite, they could've done this whole season in only 5 or 6 eps and it would've worked out just fine. Anyways the plot is really cool and the idea behind it too, the characters are pretty different one from another and they feel really lively and you end up liking all of them (except for Mora and Chamo, fuck those bitches) The animation is pretty ok and the art style is kinda cute, It seems like the artist really tried hard to make all the characters look hot af. If you love fuck your mind making theories and doing random detective job WHILE enjoying some good quality action, this is your anime.\\n",

            "content": "NO PLOT SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW, but if you read this, it's possible you'll enter the story with some... unfair knowledge, shall we say. You have been warned.\r\nRokka no Yuusha. For starters, the Crunchyroll tags for this are misleading. It's tagged as \"action, fantasy, adventure,\" and while it does contain all of those things, that's hardly the genre of this first season (and I hope it doesn't get more than one season). This is essentially a mystery 'whodunnit' anime in a fantasy setting with some action-adventure elements/scenes. \r\nWhat's the setup? In the land of Rokka no Yuusha, there exists a demon that lives on anisland. This demon cannot be killed, only contained, sealed, and put to sleep (at least, according to the backstory given). Every 300-400 years the demon re-awakens and begins an invasion of human lands, and at this time, the \"goddess of fate\" of this land selects 6 people to protect the land and re-seal the demon. \\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is Adlet, self-proclaimed strongest man alive, who is chosen to be one of these 6 Brave fighters, which, coincidentally, is his dream/goal. After some basic setup story, we arrive at the designated point where the 6 adventurers are supposed to meet... only to find that a total of seven people bear the mark that shows them to be selected by the goddess. Moreover, it appears that someone, presumably the fake seventh Brave, has engaged a trap to keep all of them confined in the forest surrounding the temple that was to be the rendezvous point. Due to some unfortunate circumstantial evidence (that does appear highly suspicious from an outsider's perspective, admittedly), Adlet is suspected. In order to prove his innocence, disengage the trap, and get the 6 Braves out, he must determine who the fake seventh Brave is and how exactly they fooled everyone.\\n\\n\r\nA good setup, right? Done well, this setup has the potential to lead to Game of Throne-esque intrigue levels, with everyone suspecting everyone else and no one able to trust one another. Perhaps it's for this reason that Crunchyroll lists Fate/Zero as a related anime. In any case, I thought it sounded interesting and gave it a shot. \\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes were a bit slow, admittedly, but that's not the issue, as after all, we need to meet the cast and start suspecting everyone. Admittedly, it would've been nice if there weren't a literal roll call scene, but the setup for it was both natural and believable, so I'll give it a pass. \\n\\n\r\nMy problems with this show are twofold - the buildup and the ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe buildup of the mystery is, in my opinion, done well overall. Unfortunately, it does mess up a few key things. For starters, the cast contains a character who is blatantly \"the shifty, suspicious one.\" This almost immediately exonerates that person from being the culprit, as it would be too obvious. Moreover, nothing he does ever makes us suspicious of him other than his profession and his... sparse background information, shall we say. Secondly, for some reason, the show thinks itself clever by using camera angles and such to \"hint\" or \"foreshadow\" the true culprit. Unfortunately, to anyone who's actually aware of such cheap tricks, that just ruins the tension. Why would you focus on that otherwise perfectly normal (at least within context) moment if it didn't carry some kind of weight? It would've been fine had you at least somewhat explained it away, but you didn't even do that with a throwaway line of dialogue. You focused on an otherwise inconspicuous moment for no apparent reason, either at the time or post de facto, which just screams \"plot twist.\" This is further reinforced by how much they focus on the character who is implicated by that particular shot and their suspicious actions. And I apologize for being so frustratingly vague, but if I were to say or change anything there, I'm certain it would be too easy to give away the ending. In addition to that, there were some characters with completely insufficient screen time and characterization to ever be the culprit. They could be eliminated by the time you get to the last quarter of the show, simply because to make them the villain would rob all impact from the twist. However, literally, were it not for these three things, the second more than the others, the buildup would've been perfect. Indeed, even as is, I was doubting that conclusion I had drawn from that second flaw right up until the last episode - \"Perhaps it really was just a meaningless shot they focused on for no reason? Bad art direction is a thing, I suppose...\" - but then my prediction was correct. /sigh. \\n\\n\r\nNext, the ending. Even ignoring the Shyamalan-esque \"what a twist!\" nature of the ending, it was not an easy one to swallow. This ties somewhat into the above criticism of the buildup, but despite the predictable nature of the identity of the culprit, the manner in which they're revealed felt more like a deus ex machina. Here is some sudden new information, not available literally until this episode, that all but spells out who the culprit is! Aren't we smart. No hinting at even the potential existence of this information, it just pops up out of nowhere to close up the plot. And then, to add further insult to injury, not only does the story end without a resolution to THE DEMON KING WHO HAS JUST AWOKEN, which at least would be somewhat forgivable considering it's an adaptation (even if literally every single anime seems to do this \"read the manga/LN\" ending with no confirmed follow up seasons), but they also end it in such a fashion as to make the entire mystery of this season... utterly worthless. My reaction to the ending of that last episode was \"OH GODDAMMIT.\" As a firm believer that an ending makes or breaks a show, this one definitely broke it for me.\\n\\n\r\nFinal conclusions? It was definitely entertaining. It might be worth a single watch. However, if you're any avid watcher of mysteries, this one isn't going to be any mystery to you, and there is little to no rewatch value here.",

Rokka no Yuusha was a fun ride from beginning to end and it's got incredible value in rewatching it. \r\nFor an anime that covered a mere one volume of its manga in the full season, this show manages to just absolutely cram action and events into each episode. There's not a lot of predictability here and I was usually left very curious about where the plot would go next at the end of each episode. You're put on a tight rope from the start and itnever slacks or loses that tension right up to the end. Mystery, suspense and drama abound in a way that leaves you excited instead of worn out. \\n\\n\r\nI rated art lower because the cgi monsters and some animation issues were often noticeable enough to distract from what was going on. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are unique, don't depend on known archetypes too much, and feel like they have agency and ambition of their own. I know I went through times of disliking and loving most of them which helped them feel fleshed out and genuine.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nMy previous review was taken down, so I decided to edit it a bit and put it back up. This'll be my second review so please excuse the mistakes. This will contain spoilers up to episode 12.\r\nHow I got into Rokka and my initial impressions:\r\nI was browsing the animesuggest subreddit, and one guy mentioned Rokka as a show where the main character used all sorts of cheap tricks and gadgets to beat his opponents, and I saw it on Crunchyroll, so I decided to watch it on a whim. \r\nI loved it from the first episode. I don't mind \"cheesy\" or clichestorylines, like chosen warriors going to fight a demon, if they're done well/differently, and I thought this one was. The opening with Adlet at a tournament was epic - I really liked watching him challenge both fighters and defeating them with relative ease. His confidence was well-founded, and I found his character entertaining. (more on his character later and why he's my favorite character at the moment)\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe idea of a great demon awakening and several warriors being chosen to defeat it is not the most original story in the world. That said, there aren't any truly \"original\" plots anymore; everything is derivative of something else nowadays. Rokka takes this formula and deviates very much, changing it more into a mystery than an action series, and I much prefer that. \\n\\n\r\nI personally really like the story and think its done better than a lot of other fantasy esque shows I've seen. I appreciated that it wasn't simply the \"chosen\" ones by birth. Instead the six braves could only be chosen by showing their strength in front of the goddess statue, ex the tournament in the first episode. To me, that's a lot better than other shows where the main hero is born or just randomly finds himself awakening to the power, because it means the heroes have proven their strength and were selected.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the epicness of having to go up against a great demon that not even the strongest goddess of a past life could defeat. It gives the show a high stakes feel, especially since losing even one of the six braves would be a huge loss. The demon's fiend soldiers are also not just generic monsters. They have the ability to talk, fly, transform, and it makes the battles more interesting than typical shonen/action fare where its just \"hack and slash\".\\n\\n\r\nThat brings me to another thing I really like about the fighting: I feel that the characters and such fight both smartly and very differently. Adlet is the prime example, as he uses many bombs, swords, needles, and other gadgets and weapons to compensate for his strength. I really like trickster heroes and he's probably the best one I've ever seen. (For those who don't know, trickster heroes are heroes who fight with cleverness rather than pure strength; they are typically underdogs in their fights) I also really appreciate how he has actively studied the fiends and applies science readily in their battles. Its brilliant and very different from typical action shows. (The closest comparison I can think of is Hunter X Hunter where the battles are more battles of wit). I love Adlet's case even more because of how ordinary he is - its explicitly pointed out that he was never gifted or talented; he had to slave away for 8 years to gain the false strength he has now.\\n\\n\r\nOther heroes also fight differently which makes it each fight different, yet enjoyable, such as Goldov and his spear/brutality when he attacks. Fremy's usage of many bombs and bullets are also interesting, and Hans especially has a very exotic yet cool fighting style (I especially remember the scene where he used his sword like a pogo stick to stab Adlet)\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest draws is also the air of mystery around the series. The presence of a seventh brave was shown in the initial trailer, and the episodes do a good job leading up to it. There is also another mystery down the line of the illusion fog barrier's activation, and I really appreciate that this show tries to challenge its watcher to think a bit. Pure action alone would not add this much suspense and tension, and I love watching it, on the edge of my seat.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nEach of the characters seems to have a different color scheme and everyone is very clearly differentiated. They all seem to have pretty different body types, clothes, armors, weapons, etc, and the character designs show them off very well. The characters are both cool and interesting to look at.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the animation very much, and I thought it was pleasing to my eyes throughout the series. It was easy to follow what happened in action sequences, and the towns and such were clear to see as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe only issue was toward the end, when Passione seemed to run low on their animation budget, and many frames became very choppy. I don't mind that much, but it did hurt the experience a bit. I don't mind though since they're a beginner studio and this is only their second project!\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI don't have the greatest ears, but I loved the first opening and constantly looped it. The actions and voice actors were all fine too, with no problems. I probably enjoy Adlet's VA the most - I can just feel the confidence when he talks. I think the voices and such are very enjoyable and give a good vibe of the characters in general.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also plays songs at some nice moments, which really helps raise the tension/epicness, and I really enjoyed that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nOn Adlet: I loved this character so much and his transformation from his youth. I find his back story to be quite touching. We saw him in his peaceful village, where he said he would be happy just picking mushrooms because he's good at it. This childhood innocence hit me quite deep inside, as we see him lose his entire village, and he soon becomes a very pitiable, vengeful boy who trains non-stop for 8 years to get his revenge. I really liked this as his line of picking mushrooms was so mundane...I found it ironic how he came from there to where he is now in the show, and I found it a bit sad too.\\n\\n\r\nYet, we also see the kind of man he's become. He has a strong sense of camaderie, quickly forgiving those allies who tried to kill him. When he knew the pressure was on him and no one believed him, he didn't give up, and he successfully proved the trap of the seventh with his own wit and willpower. I really like the essence of positivity he generates; its what I always wanted in my main heroes: self confidence and a high sense of competence.\\n\\n\r\nAdlet also made a great detective, slowly eliminating possibilities by gaining testimonies from everyone. At the same time, he set preparations in case he did fail - for example, his kyoma detection spray, which he used to guarantee Fremy's safety.\\n\\n\r\nThese moments and much more (especially in the Light Novels) made me love his character so much. Some fans may find his \"I'm the world's strongest\" rather irritating, but I appreciated it, as that's his coping mechanism. In addition, he doesn't say it out of arrogance - he wants to be the world's strongest as a mental fortification of sorts so that he can believe in himself even when times are at their worst.\\n\\n\r\nOn Fremy: I think Fremy is the second most interesting character in the series, as we see her gradually open up to Adlet. None of the other characters are developed or revealed as much, but we do see Fremy transform a bit, from the cold-hearted distrustful woman she was to someone who could trust another, just a little bit more. I found her transformation of trust to also be belivable - she always doubted Adlet, and she didn't truly change her mind until Adlet showed he was willing to die for her - and I think that is a strong enough case for her transformation. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other characters: The other characters are really explored in more depth in the light novels, so I can't say as much at the moment. I found most of the characterization to be enjoyable or believable, though I wish Nachetanya's mental snaps were a bit less emphasized. As far as the novels, I enjoyed seeing Goldof's characterization in volume 3 the most.\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I haven't had many problems with Rokka. Its my favorite this season and its very enjoyable. Its probably the best fantasy/magic one I've seen yet. It doesn't rely on lame gags, it has realistic reactions and high stakes, the fights and discussions are clever and are definitely more intellectual than most other shows, and its good at dropping hooks at the end of the episodes to keep the viewer curious what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the things I disliked - I wish Adlet hadn't confessed to Fremy with an \"I love you\". It just felt sudden. I know their relationship is expanded in the later light novels, but I preferred a translation I read elsewhere, where he just said \"I care about you\", which I find an easier pill to swallow for two people who've known each other less than 3 days. I dislike that in the last episode, they left out a brief discussion on another character (Saint of Words who wouldve been able to instantly detect the fake; in the novels she is mentioned but too far away to come in time). Its not important, but the character is brought up in the second light novel. I also felt Rolonia and the army's introduction felt a little rushed and could've been done better. I think overall, episode 12 was a bit disappointing, since 11 was so, so climactic and good. I also wish ep 1 had the scene where Adlet explained why he had to crash the tournament instead of fighting from the getgo (in the novels, its because his weapons werent allowed).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the tinier things I did dislike - I suppose the pacing can be a bit quick at times, such as the sudden 3 other braves arriving nearly at once or Nachetanya and Adlet suddenly charging out of the country. Some scenes initially with Nachetanya and Adlet alone felt a little strange that they were so close already, but none of these were huge issues and are more just nitpickings.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, for me personally, my favorite painting is The Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog, a painting showing a wanderer on a cliff looking out at a large fog beneath and ahead of him. It represents a traveler in the face of adversity and an unknown future, and I found this illusion fog barrier arc to remind me of that a bit - Adlet and the heroes are obscured in this fog, and they do not know what is ahead and around them, nor do they know why this is happening. This tension throughout the show really helped carry it along in my eyes.",

            "content": "I just finished my last three episodes of Rokka no Yuusha today, after binge-watching 9 episodes straight and going to sleep at 5AM. This anime had piqued my interest even before it was released just from the character designs.\r\nThis is my first time ever writing a review and I\u2019ve decided to do so because of this very anime.\r\nThe story\u2019s got good potential, but I felt as if the anime failed in being able to flesh it out completely and rather, it just did one massive \u2013 literal \u2013 loop with the story. You\u2019d know what I mean if you decide to watch it.\r\nDon\u2019t get mewrong, Rokka no Yuusha \u2013 or rather, Braves of the Six Flowers isn\u2019t an entirely bad series. It was quite good, but just to an extent.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly loved the character designs; Flamie\u2019s design was the whole reason I wanted to watch it in the first place. Adlet\u2019s hair was a bit too flamboyant for me, but in a way, I guess it matched his character. The other characters were done nicely as well; Goldov was a hunk and you never really get an insight on why Nachetanya decided to dress up like a rabbit or if Hans cat tail was fake or not. The 3D-ish take on the fiends were quite interesting and personally \u2013 this is probably just me though \u2013 I find the smoothness in their art oddly satisfying. The overall setting of the anime was rather typical of an adventure-action anime, so it was nothing new.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of storyline, I\u2019m going to keep saying that it was indeed a wasted potential. I\u2019m just so mad because it could\u2019ve been so much more \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t. The whole mystery genre didn\u2019t really work out too well for it either and on top of that, the action genre played its part and yes, I admit that some fighting scenes were rather decent but all in all, there was no climax. I felt like there was fighting in there \u2013 especially between the Braves \u2013 just for the sake of fighting.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, character development declined as the series went on. Especially for Adlet\u2019s character. He had such a strong appearance in the beginning but its original flare was lost and then regained then lost and then regained and so on\u2026 However, a little bit of Adlet\u2019s initial personality which drew me in did eventually make a solid comback towards the end. Nachetanya was poorly developed, in my opinion. Her character was a little all over the place and inconsistent, and that caused me to feel put off about how she was portrayed. She had the potential to be a main-main character \u2013 if you know what I mean \u2013 beside Adlet, and I believe that was what she was meant to be but then she was cast aside way too early in the story. Goldov was the one character that eventually became transparent towards the end, and it\u2019s a shame because he was a character I really wanted to see come to life a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Rokka no Yuusha isn\u2019t bad. It just has a few holes here and there and you might become annoyed at how frequently you hear the phrase \u2018I\u2019m the strongest man in the world\u2019 but if you\u2019re into some adventure and some spot-the-imposter mystery, I\u2019d say to give it a shot. If a better job was done with developing and tweaking the plot and characters a little, it could\u2019ve truly become a gem. However, as it stands, I\u2019m quite disappointed even after finishing the series and I know this sounds horrible but its left me with an inkling of a \u2018maybe this wasted my time\u2019 sort of feeling. Horrible, I know, but quite true.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Rokka no Yuusha, a common \"Chosen Ones to kill the Overlord\" theme with twist of mystery, a dash of romance, and a bit, if not fair amount, of action. I'd say it was a notable anime for it tested not my intelligence and wits but focused on me clinging on my own deductions and answers. You will notice signs for you to answer the main question (Rather they were too noticeable IMO), but this anime will grind that thought and put your self-confidence on your calculations onto hard-paved ground. Will you let go of your deduction, or will you see the end while still pointingyour precious index finger to the culprit? Dum-dum-duummmm...... Eherm.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6: Aside from the unique Aztec-like setting, the background story felt like a \"Certain\" valkyrie mythology (Yep, forgot the title. I'm not even sure if it was an animu. Teehee) fused with Mayan/Aztec culture content. The mystery was easy, and yet it was hard to cling on due to confusions, trick scenes, and certain \"Evidence\" only popping out at the end of the series. In that sense, it could go better if the clues were scattered evenly, and they were better explained than just saying \"Oh, we found these things while we were looking.\". (I mean, can't they at least found it in a more shrouded way? *Shrugs*)\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9: The art was probably the only thing great that I can see. The battle scenes were great, but they could have gone even better (Then again, it focused on the mystery so I didn't mind it). That said, it wasn't bad in any ways too. The flame and knife CG caught my eyes, specifically.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7: Good enough to go with. They could've added a few more ambience but with the setting and all, I can't really complain.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6: All of them are unique, but I know most of us have seen their character personality on other anime characters. Straight-forward, Sly, etc. I don't really care about personality repeats due to the number of Anime out there (Well, personality is a limited value integer in the industry), but their personality choices also hints the answer to the crucial question. (If you don't get it, go watch Detective Conan or Kindaichi Shounen no Jikenbo).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10: I gave it a personal 10 due to me being right in the end (YES!), but that's just me. It would really go random based on how a viewer sees the anime. I gave it a 10 due to me being correct on the question and after that spiraling and very confusing dilemmas, the after effect was like \"YEAH! I SAW THAT COMING MA!\"-feeling (Wait.... I didn't say that IRL m'kay?!).\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8: Rokka no Yuusha is really a notably decent series. The mystery wasn't hard enough for a mystery nut, but the viewpoint with the most impact in this is keeping your self-confidence in your answer solid. The romance was a bonus too, I kinda liked the pairing.",

I don't know about the light novel series if it follows the same ratio but this first season I can confidently say this is accurate. Here's the thing, I don't know of any other anime that is a fantasy thriller, so this might catch you off balance I think but it is pretty good. The story starts as your almost typical fantasy the huge difference is the protagonist claiming to be the \"most powerful man\" in theworld fights in a very unconventional way which did catch me off balance but I liked it a lot as it wasn't the typical shounen protagonist. In any case, I just wanted to point that out so you don't come in blind expecting this is a fantasy and going \"wtf is happening\".\\n\\n\r\nAlso in all honesty, there is a number of \"holes\" if you really think about it, but it's really a fun anime. No, you don't have to turn your brain off, but they do exist.",

            "content": "Story: 8/10\r\nMy favorite genre of anime is fantasy so I was quite excited to see such a well-drawn anime of that genre in the season anime list, but my expectations with the story were blown away. The story is told mostly from the perspective of Adlet Mayer, who proclaims to be the \u2018strongest man in the World\u2019. While yes, it is a simple story that follows the path of many fantasy anime (\u201cYeah let\u2019s all go and kill the demon king!\u201d), it brings to the table new elements which refreshes the classic viewpoint. The characters are rather unique, something that did bothered me is thatthey didn\u2019t made enough spotlight for everyone (that\u2019s to be expected of the first season, let\u2019s hope there\u2019s a second season).  Some may say it was a predictable ending but at least that made the plot smoother in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 \\n\r\nIt was the first thing that draw me into the anime, it\u2019s stunning from my perspective. The background is something that is easily missed but if you look closely you can see how much effort they placed in it, surely the art is what will make it more memorable for me. I will be honest, I read the book before I even started watching the anime and everything seemed to fit perfectly, from the character\u2019s expression to the scenery. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nKenichi Suzumura will always make characters I fall in love with, simply that. The anime had two openings an/d 3 endings, which all sound great and fit the theme of the anime perfectly. Overall the voice acting was okay, but what took the price was the atmospheric sounds and music which made it more absorbing to the spectator. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe development of characters was lacking but that\u2019s only because it was meant to be that way (at least the story doesn\u2019t ends on episode 12). Every character has their traits that make them different and unique, while a lot of things were left unexplained regarding certain character\u2019s personalities. You can definitely see how characters grew in the series, some grow was rather forced and I actually did not like that. The main antagonist is the Majin (\u201cDemon King\u201d), who leads the Kyoumas, but this specific season doesn\u2019t focuses on the Majin at all, even more it is not seen through the anime. I grew fond of all the characters (yes they are all my babies and I love them dearly), but if I had to choose from all I would pick Fremy or Nashetania. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 \\n\r\nI personally loved the series, but I will admit it has its weak points. Definitely would recommend it if you like fantasy-adventure animes, it also involves a bit of mystery that will not put you on the edge of your seat but will be amusing to watch develop. I will continue reading the light novel and maybe re-read the books from 1-3.  \\n",

            "content": "When I first saw a commercial of Rokka no Yuusha I was grasped immediately, I thought it was going to be similar to lord of the rings and an epic fantasy anime. However when I actually watched it I got something a bit different but I was satisfied nonetheless.\r\n  Let's start with the facts: Rokka no Yuusha or Rokka: The Braves of the Six flowers, is a summer 2015 anime series based off the light novel of the same name. At face value RNY seems like a basic fantasy story. However one of the main strengths of this show is the effortless blend of2 genres, in this case fantasy and mystery.\\n\\n\r\n  What I found great about this anime is the aforementioned seamless blend of genres. I also found it to be a stellar narrative with an engaging plot. The mystery component of this show is handled really well and is very compelling, intriguing, and keeps you guessing. The animation and art is also beautiful with lots of color however I found the use of CGI to be a hit or miss. The music was solid as well with some really great opening themes. The voice acting wasn't anything amazing but was still solid. And on another note I absolutely loved the setting, I haven't seen many anime with as great and intriguing of a setting as RNY and in ways it reminds me of middle earth. The action scenes were also well done and exciting to watch.\\n\\n\r\n  However I had many significant issues with this show. Ok so one of the biggest problems I had is the lack of episodes, I feel that if RNY had more episodes many issues I am about to mentioned would be resolved. One is the lack of story progression, as we know RNY's most important plot point is discovering the imposter. Well that's fine but why did we have to spend 2 thirds of the freaking season on it. Seriously more episodes would have resolved this but starting at episode 4 there only goal was to find the imposter while blatantly ignoring the main objective of the ENTIRE ANIME, which is defeating the demon king. \\n\\n\r\nI found the characters to be a mixed bag, some were interesting and some weren't. Let's take Hans for an example, I think he was an intriguing and funny character that was extremely dynamic. Then we hit the rest of them who are fine but they needed more development which also stems to the aforementioned lack of episodes. And lastly the ending, OH MY GOD THE ENDING. Seriously this ending with lack of better words was complete garbage. I can't really explain why without spoilers bit seriously that was one of those read the manga endings. \\n\r\n In that last paragraph it may have sounded like I hated Rokka no Yuusha. But that is far from reality, Rokka no Yuusha is a very good fantasy anime that smartly combines mystery and a compelling mystery at that. The visuals were gorgeous, the setting was fantastic, the voice acting was stellar, and the story was brilliant. I think if it had 26 episodes it would have been perfect. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion despite it not being a completed story you should definitely check RNY out if you like fantasy or mystery and if a second season comes out I will definitely be checking that out. So until that happens try to enjoy RNY for what it is, a solid anime.",

            "content": "Now i don't normally watch suspense mysteries in general and if I can remember correctly, the last one I watched was Psycho Pass (just season 1). I was in for quite a pleasant surprise though when I watched Rokka No Yussha. Short version, go watch it. It's a very good series that I would probably call a hidden gem this season.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe main story was nothing new. You have a group of heroes selected to take on the Demon King and save the world yada yada yada. The story itself adds nothing original to what most of us have probably already seen in a fantasyanime or read in any fantasy fiction in one form or another. What makes Rokka shine though is that it actually used it's story as a background to introduce what made this show so great, human intrigue or to put it more clearly, suspicions between one another. I admit, I'm not one that normally enjoys the mystery genre but Rokka was presented in such a way that it made it very interesting to watch the plots and theories fly around all the while keeping it suspenseful with fights going on. I know this really isn't the best way to describe the story but to say anymore than this would probably venture into spoiler territory so i'm going to avoid doing that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art in general feels very distinct in a sense. The way characters were outlined clearly against their background and the background scenery itself seemed very standard for an action anime. Nothing really stood out in the art for me... well maybe except for Fremy but that's because she reminded me of Snake from Metal Gear Solid but apart from that, the art of the anime overall felt very standard.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this anime is quite good. It added effect where it was required and overall helped to set the tone of the scene quite well. The OP and the ED were nothing special but I do appreciate what they chose to do with them. Watch to find out more cause I'm not going to say anything more about this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nNow, Rokka probably shines quite well here. The protagonist is first portrayed as one of those generic characters you find in nearly anime of this sort. Brave, kind and believes in his friends. He even brags about being the \"strongest man in the world.\" What makes the protagonist in the anime so good though is that when he's put in an especially trying situation, he doesn't play the whole HERO card but rather becomes a lot more human. I was impressed at how well the character was portrayed and fleshed out throughout the series. The side characters though pretty much act the way they were portrayed from the get-go. I do admit, they was quite a bit of character progression for some of the characters but unfortunately, not all the characters were treated the same though I get a feeling their time would come later.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9\\n\r\nWhen I first started Rokka, I was just randomly browsing myanimelist to see what new anime came out and decided to give this show a try. By the 8th episode, I was hooked real bad and remembered screaming at my computer for more episodes as I had caught up. Now that I've finished it, it leaves quite a bitter sweet taste in my mouth. It's a cliff-hangar ending in short. I thought I should've added this in for those of you that do not enjoy such endings. I do admit the anime does take quite a while to get-going but I would suggest for that part anyway, just treat it as another adventure anime and you'll be fine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nWell Rokka was definitely good don't get me wrong. It's just that it doesn't end and with no announcement for season 2 yet, I find it a bit hard to give this a higher rating that the one above. I do recommend you try this anime though as it's quite good in my amateur experience with mystery and I've to understand a bit why people enjoy the genre so much.",

Some of of the center-characters get more background and development than others and so it might get you on the right train to solve this mystery early. For me it didn't ruin the show and it was a nice way to spend a weekend.\r\nThe only thing that really annoyed me was the last 5-10 minutes. I don't know the original light novel and how it ended or continued, but I think theanime adaption could have been concluded in a much nicer and less obscure way.",

            "content": "Some minor spoilers, but no major spoilers. \r\nThe story and premise is acceptable: demons invade human land and 6 heroes are chosen by a goddess to suppress the demon king. Two meet up immediately and off they go on an adventure for a typical adventure story. The plan is to meet with the other 4 right outside demon land. They meet 2 more and turns out one of the heroes used to be a baddie, but everybody is buddy buddy in the end. That is until they reach the rendezvous point where they end up trapped by a magic barrier. And oh my why arethere 7 heroes instead of 6? And so the anime makes a sharp turn from a fantasy action anime to a whodunnit style mystery with a fantasy twist. Personally I love mysteries so this was actually a pleasant surprise. But if you were expecting an action anime I'm sorry, it's not the main focus. While the mystery is satisfactorily solved by the end of this season, the season does end on a rather cheap and unsatisfying cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the major flaws is the artwork. The CGI monsters are pretty bad. Other than that the action sequences are enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest strength of this anime is probably the characters, none of them wholly unlikable and each unique in terms of personality and design. While backstories aren't given for all of them, the ones that were are solid enough. Adlet at times can be a little annoying with his self-proclaimed strongest man in the world title but ultimately we come to realize he's a good guy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this one since I love mysteries and I liked the fantasy twist on the whodunnit theme with this colorful cast of characters. The resolution was unexpected but satisfying in terms of the logic of this anime's universe. \\n\\n\r\nThe CGI and the cliffhanger really detracted from it though, which is why I give it a 7 instead of an 8.",

            "content": "\"What you see is not always what it seems.\"\r\nI think the statement above is applicable to this show. \r\nRokka no Yuusha felt like the typical adventure-fantasy-magic-action anime, but after a few episodes, it explored a premise which is quite uncommon for those adventure-fantasy-magic-action anime; mystery. A mission to slay the Demon King suddenly got turned into a dangerous guessing game of \"who's the traitor?\" In the first place,that's what got me interested in this show.\r\nAlthough many reviewers say that the mystery aspect in the show is crappy, I think that it's actually quite decent (before the last episode at least). Yeah, maybe I'm quite dense,but I wasn't able to figure out who the traitor is. As the show progressed, my suspect list changed again and again, but in the end I guessed wrong. I like how the show managed to keep me guessing, trying to figure out the M.O of the culprit. Almost every one of the six (or should I say seven) heroes had a reason to be suspected, like their suspicious behaviour, the sudden close-ups...\\n\\n\r\nThe ending spoilt the series though. The plot is progressing...then suddenly there's this twist. Surprise!!The one who is not what he/she seems is the traitor. It's good and bad at the same time. Yeah, it caught me off guard, but it made those earlier explanations seemed pointless. Like, what a waste of time. The revelation of the traitor's identity could have been executed better so that it doesn't feel so sudden and rushed.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, those anticipating a battle between the heroes and some 'Big Bosses' typically found in this kind of genre would be utterly disappointed, because more than half of the episodes were dedicated to the \"guessing game\". Action scenes are abundant, but it's mainly fights with the fiends and among the heroes. The action scenes make up for it, as battle scenes are fluid and done nicely. It was easy and entertaining to watch. The art is average, but sometimes it can be pretty as well; the sunsets were beautiful. The landscapes were diverse and colourful, but there was not too much detail given to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are nice and pretty. I think that Flamie's design is very unique, with her white hair and eyes and also her attire. The main character, Adlet is also likeable, if you just look past his annoying 'strongest man in the world' punchline. He's capable and is a genius, and he also got some background development. Only a few characters got background or developed, but the others didn't really felt unimportant. The cast is pretty colorful and diverse with all their different personalities. The VA's did a great job as they portray their characters excellently. Take Flamie for example, when she was emotionless, her voice sounded emotionless also. When she was sad, she sounded sad. It was befitting.The soundtracks used suit the events well. The OPs and the EDs gave the right vibe for this show, and I personally like the second OP.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all its flaws, I had fun guessing. However, I wouldn't recommend this show to someone looking for epic action and mind-boggling mystery,though. If you've got some time to kill, this anime would do, take out the magnifying glass, and start analysing. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Spoilers will exist, don't read if you don't want to be spoiled!\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe backstory is very average, poor even, but that's not what made this show entertaining. And the reason for a 7 will explained later on.\r\nSo the backstory of this series is a Demon God once threatened mankind and a to combat this, a goddess selected six heroes, called Braves, to basically be her champion and to defeat the Demon God. Now the Demon God is reviving once again so another six Braves are to be selected to defeat it. Sounds trite already? Well don't be fooled, the backstory may be lackluster but theexecution is quite interesting. \\n\\n\r\nSo our main point of view is from Adelet, a self proclaimed 'strongest man in the world', and it starts off with him basically ruining a martial arts tournament by interrupting it. He gets overwhelmed by the guards and is then thrown in jail. As expected, he's chosen as one of the six Braves along with the princess of the country. They leave/escape together and make their way towards the location where the Braves are supposed to meet. Basically a bunch of other character introductions are made and we're at a more interesting part.\\n\\n\r\nWhen all the Braves meet up, there are seven instead of six, meaning that one of them is an imposter. The seal at the temple that they arrive at also activates and a fog settles in which seals them within the area. Adelet is assumed the imposter because he was the first to arrive then a series of detective work ensues which makes the rest of the episodes very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIt concludes with the correct imposter being found out, but on the final episode another character is introduced who is also a 'Brave', thus the mystery continues.\\n\\n\r\nThe way it concludes leaves a fairly unsatisfying end, the series could have been 24 episodes to give us a better ending, though perhaps the source material does not have enough at the moment (haven't read it). As such, judging by the anime alone, the story is only at a 7.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI liked the character designs and how each one had their own unique costumes. The male protagonists did not look generic and the females character weren't just oversexualised nonsense that you would find in any hentai. The backgrounds tended to be blurred out to focus on the characters and the CGI was not amazing, but I suppose acceptable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThough personally I wouldn't listen to the OP or ED independently, I think they flowed really well with their corresponding sequences, especially the ED. The ED just had this very good vibe to it that left it memorable.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, I think the characters' voice selections were appropriate. For those who loved Gosick and especially loved Victorique's voice actor, you should have a sense of familiarity when Fremy speaks. I absolutely love the way that Aoi plays out her role as Fremy, as she's able to carry out Fremy's feelings very well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThis was where I felt it became a bit uninteresting and I will specify each character as best I can.\\n\\n\r\nAdelet - He just became really annoying with his constant preachings of 'I am the strongest man in the world' nonsense. His backstory is more of the vengeful type, but he doesn't really develop as the episodes went on.\\n\\n\r\nFremy - Probably my favourite character even if it wasn't voiced by Aoi. It was quite a shock when she revealed herself as half Fiend and half human. her backstory was what lead her to be as cold as she is to other people. But her change from being cold to becoming more open when Adelet declared his love for her was just really well done.\\n\\n\r\nGoldov - He's basically a whiteknight for Nashetania and has no other real characteristics.\\n\\n\r\nChamo - Basically a violent loli who obeys Mora (Oba-chan) for non-stated reasons.\\n\\n\r\nMora - It's still very vague as to what she's really like, but it seems that she likes to jump to conclusions because they're easier and just at hand. \\n\\n\r\nHans - Another interesting character that was fleshed out quite a bit. He's an assassin whose fighting style is based on cats (still better than the concept of Ant man), and has a pretty good understanding of people due to his occupation. And despite his occupation he can be quite trusting as shown later on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER AHEAD!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNachetania - She didn't start off that interesting, just another sheltered princess who wished to explore the world. It doesn't really change throughout most of the episodes, though she does snap at one point. And even when she's revealed as the traitor it just felt a little unsatisfying the way she revealed herself and how very little was explained.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThe execution of the fight scenes are decent, though by my standards they aren't amazing. The flow of the episodes don't feel rushed nor are they boringly slow. The use of CGI tends to make me dislike the Fiend vs Braves fight scenes but otherwise it's not too bad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nSo I guess the conclusion was what made the series less appealing than it should have. Adelet was getting really annoying with that whole 'strongest man in the world' slogan",

            "content": "Overall rating: 8\r\nSet in a fantasy world where humans, warriors, Saints, fiends, and the Majin co-exist, Rokka no Yuusha uses its mystery elements to spin the story forward all the while grabbing the audience's attention with its twists and action scenes. What set the wheels of mystery in motion is the suspicion and doubt revolving around the fact that there are seven, not six, Braves that showed up at the supposed meeting place for the Heroes of the Six Braves that are chosen to fight the Majin. \r\n***(Potential spoilers; not too major.)***\r\nThe central protagonist, Adlet Mayer, proclaims himself as \"the strongest man in the world.\"To him, the meaning of the title differs from most. He thinks it entails: someone who have power, skill, wisdom, heart, and last not least, luck. Also, that when one faces danger, he/she must be able to laugh at the situation, no matter how dire it might seem and/or become. With all of that in mind, Adlet navigated his way through the tense and ominous situations that he and the other Braves comes across, as a result of all the mystery, suspicion and doubts that surrounds them. \\n\\n\r\nEach character have their own features that separates them from each other. For Adlet, something that's notable about him would definitely be his fighting style; he usually intentionally uses tricks and unexpected tactics to fight his opponents, so that they are caught off guard. Such fighting style is heavily influenced by what he learned from his master, Atro Spiker. Something else that Adlet inherited from his master would be his views on life and because of that, he's rather different from most of the hero type-esque protagonists out there. A piece of advice that he remembers from his master that he still reflects on: \"My master told me...that it was thanks to my best friend and my sister, that I could become strong. I was able to become strong because I still believed in those words. That a man can't become strong for revenge's sake. He becomes strong because he believes in something. ... I didn't get strong for revenge... I'm not fighting out of hatred. I became strong so that I won't lose anything.\" \\n\r\n***(Potential spoilers section over.)***\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting of the voice actors in this series worked well for their respective characters. Fremy's cold, quiet, yet somewhat detached-flat sounding voice fits how she comes to view others. Of course, as the story went on, her views changed through the interactions she had, particularly with Adlet and that shows in how she speaks. Chamo's childish sounding voice represents how she thinks and acts, despite being one of the strongest known Saints in the land. Mura's voice, firm, and mature shows how she presents herself (especially as she's the Head of all the Saints), and how she might seem to those around her. The voice for Nashetania is very lady-like, which resembles her being a princess. The voice that Saito Souma, Adlet's voice actor, used for Adlet suits his character well: smooth and clear--as it connects to his honesty and willingness to trust others. Hans's voice gives me the impression that he's laid-back and casual, yet calculated and logical--which he is; whenever I think of his voice, I also think of the sly smile that he usually makes. As for Goldof, his rough and low (and somewhat indifferent) sounding voice sets him apart from all the other characters. \\n\\n\r\nThis was the series that I looked forward to watching the most from the summer 2015 season, besides from Durarara!! x2: Ten. Its premise caught my attention and made me really curious as to just how the story is going to be like in an animated format--and it certainly did not disappoint. In fact, it was one of the shows that really kept me on my toes each and every week. Each episode brings something new to the table, and it keeps you wondering just what the next part of the story is going to take you. (It even led me to start reading the Light Novels, as the mystery to just how the story will unfold captured my interest and curiosity.) \\n\\n\r\nI recommend this series to watchers who like: mystery, action, fantasy, magic, dialog-heavy series, and series that are character driven--yet paired with a story that compliments them\\n\\n\r\nYou're welcome to post a comment on my profile to tell me any feedback and/or critiques you have for my review; any feedback and/or critiques are appreciated.\\n\\n\r\n***",

            "content": "Overall 8/10 I rate this anime as an 8 because it's unique with the way they made the plot and characters besides the initial part where 6 heroes go to defeat the bad guy, this anime isn't the adventure show you're looking for but turns out to be a great mystery anime.\r\nStory 7/10 It seems like the usual adventure where they go off to fight the main villain. Towards the middle to end of the series it turns into a mystery anime with lots of plot twist etc, and then they spend the rest of the anime trying to solve it.  But each episodekeeps you hooked and wanting to see more.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10 The art is very pleasing to look at, all the character designs look unique and the monsters look fierce and intimidating.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 The soundtrack fits well with the anime, the fight scenes are really fun to watch and really sets the mood for epic battles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10  I gave the characters such a low rating because there really is no character development besides the main protagonists.  All you get for most of the characters are their names and fighting technique, they give you the backstories of about 2 of the characters but the rest are kind of just there. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime just to see what happens next since this show really likes their cliffhangers.  It was something new and different to watch.",

            "content": "THIS IS MY FIRST TIME TO MAKE A REVIEW SO PLSSSS DON'T HATE ^_^\r\nThis anime is a simple fantasy anime where good guys defeat bad guys from destroying or maybe conquering the world but what makes this anime unique is unlike other fantasy anime this anime puts mystery genre in it.To make it simpler this anime is like  danganronpa but with fantasy genre.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is just really simple long time ago the world is a very dark place ruled by the Majin a demon like overlord that's what the anime tells me i think but one day a goddess came and defeat the Majinand peace is restored back to the lands but the majin is not fully defeated it was just sealed and there will be time that it will be awaken so before the goddess dies she split her powers into six petal things and when the Majin is almost awake the petals will choose six people to be braves and defeat and seal the Majin back to it's original place.Many years have past and we met our protagonist Adlet ruining a contest in some kingdom the contest is all about people fighting to prove their worthy of the goddess petal thing powers and our protagonist ruined the contest by beating the remaining contestants by \"SCIENCE\" just to prove his worthy of the powers but he got send to jail but don't worry he got the powers after the princess Nashetania (one of the six braves) found out that Adlet became of the braves she immediately freed Adlet and they went to a journey to defeat the Majin and along their journey they met other braves but (SPOILER) they got sealed in some sort of shrine where all of the main characters met but plot twist there are seven of them instead of six so all of them suspects that there's a traitor in one them which is actually true but im not telling who's the traitor because it will ruined the anime\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nAdlet is a very determined and a brave person who is what i can say your typical main protagonist he doesn't any special powers but he is kinda smart who uses science to his advantages.\\n\r\nNashetania is a princess of a kingdom and also the Saint of Blades she's a weak and not that smart person but thanks to her powers to summon blade like things she can do really well in a fight.\\n\r\nGoldof is a really strong and a mysterious character who uses a giant spear to fight and also he devoted his life to Nashetania.\\n\r\nFremy is a kuudere like person who doesn't trust anyone in the group she's a quiet and a mysterious person but we will know more about her in the anime she's the Saint of Gun Powder who uses a gun and bullets in battle.\\n\r\nChamo a young girl who is the Saint of Swamps she has a happy personality and she doesn't trust anyone in the group either except for Mora.Chamo uses a weird power to fight in battle even if she is just a young kid she is probably  the second strongest person in the group.\\n\r\nHans is a mysterious assassin who like's to mimic himself as a cat he's a strong and fast character who uses two machete looking things to fight also he uses a weird fighting style.\\n\r\nAn lastly Mora she's a extremely serious and intellectual women who is the Saint of Mountains she's really strong and probably the strongest of the group and also she is the leader of all the Saints.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nOne of the problems to me in the anime is the art some moment in the anime shows how good the art is but most of the time it's just really bad and i can't blame the anime because probably the creators of this anime doesn't have enough budget to make the art good i think but if you can passed the art i'm pretty sure you will have a good time watching the anime\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/SOUND\\n\r\nWell there's not much i can say about the music/sounds in this anime all i can say is i like it i like the openings and the endings of this anime i also liked the battle musics and the musics they put when there's mysterious scene happening that's all i can say about the music/sounds\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nWell all i can say is that i really enjoy the anime i liked the simple but with a twist story i like the characters i like the music but that doesn't mean that this anime doesn't have any flaws the art for me was kinda bad sometimes,the anime for me was kinda slow the anime kinda got stuck in the part where they got sealed and they need to find who the seventh was even through for me they can fasten up that part and lastly i kinda don't like how the anime make the seventh so obvious.I actually read the light novel and for me guessing who the seventh was really hard unlike the anime but even with all of that problems i really enjoy the anime and i highly recommend watching this anime\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nLastly i rate this anime 8/10 because i liked this anime it's unique and it's one of the greatest anime i have watch this season.Also AdletXFremy Whoahhhhhhh!!!!!!! *founds out that Fremy is not a virgin anymore* \\n\r\nT___T Whyyyyyyyy!!!! must life destroy my ship.Oh yeah this is KantanOtaku and byee!!!!",

            "content": "I'm always a fan of plots involving people who need to unite in order to save the world, though if it gets ridiculous I do have to bail out. The synopsis sounded a little promising, though, with six different people wielding unique powers that weren't the typical elements. The cover image looked intriguing as well; every character looked like he/she had some sort of secret to unveil. I was expecting an action-packed series revolving around this person who was the seventh saint.\r\nI liked the legend of the heroes of the six flowers, when seeing the threat of the demon king approaching their world in realitywas not that terrifying. I'm not sure if that information is being saved for a second season or something, but all I knew of the demon king from the beginning was that his presence was like a black cloud that pervaded the land and everyone suddenly cowered in fear. Oh, and there were fiends, various grotesque monsters that attacked everyone (some of which could talk), but that seemed to be all.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, while I knew that the series was going to be focused on revealing the identity of the impostor, I was really hoping that I could see them fight the Demon King. Unfortunately, that never comes to happen in these 12 episodes as it is of the utmost importance for them to rid themselves of the seventh before he/she kills them all. In the process of doing that, though, they come up with several theories as to what happened to cause this, and they waste a lot of time speculating on what will happen. What initially seemed like a good idea for a plot at the beginning became annoying.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a big fan of main characters falling in love with pretty girls right away, but when more history is explained and other characters are introduced to shake things up to strengthen or otherwise break relationships, I'm happier. This isn't the typical love-at-first-sight romance, let me tell you that, but I won't mention anything more.\\n\\n\r\nThe seven characters here are quite a gang of people. Aside from having distinct appearances and outfits, their fighting styles and weapons are very cool. Despite having recently discovered that they had been chosen to become one of the braves, they seem to have a good command of their newly acquired powers. Most of them acquire powers that are very similar to the skills that they already have, so it is merely an addition to their strengths.\\n\\n\r\nWhile there are the six of them to talk about, the main character is Adlet Mayer, and he certainly changes a lot in the span of 12 episodes. My first thought of him was that he was a conceited weakling with the over-the-top catch phrase: \"I am the strongest man in the world!\" He doesn't have the largest muscles anyone's ever seen, but he's stocked with clever tools that allow him to trick others for an instant, paralyze or poison them, etc. He's quick on his feet, thinks fast, and has quite long red hair that is slightly unkempt and tied back in a loose ponytail at the bottom of it.\\n\\n\r\nStrongest man in the world? Ha! I'm sure everyone else in the show scoffed at him when he gave himself that title. While he doesn't look like he could beat Goldov in an arm wrestling contest, his actions later in the show do change your opinion of him after. He's capable of saying foolish things, but also of saying intelligent things. Adlet is a very positive person, and even when the situation looks the most bleak for him, he always has some bit of motivation to think of ways to turn things around. I came to like him better as the series came to a close.\\n\\n\r\nAs I might have said so before, the animation for fight scenes were not bad. I at no time had trouble following the action, and since the characters had their own ways of dodging and attacking, their movements seemed new all the time and fresh on the scene. I especially liked the animations done for Chamot's powers.\\n\\n\r\nArt-wise, I was very impressed with the backgrounds of the anime and took several screenshots. The colors of characters' irises and hair were vibrant, and the braves all had different body structures. It really wasn't bad.\\n\\n\r\nSome small things I didn't like were the fiends' blood spillage (looked super unrealistic, but I guess it shouldn't be so bad since fiends and humans shouldn't have similar blood), characters' faces from faraway (faces were a little funky), and two of the characters wearing chest bands (not protective at all for the rest of the torso!). \\n\\n\r\nI can't say that the soundtrack stood out to me very much for this anime. Most pieces fit the mood just fine (exhilarating action, imminent dread, revealed secret, etc.), but they weren't songs that I'd remember forever. The opening and endings were also just all right for me. They are poppy and otherwise nice to listen to, but not my favorite things.\\n\\n\r\nI don't recall watching more than two episodes at once for this anime, so it wasn't the most interesting show to me. However, it did pick up in the last few episodes, so I was happy about that. It isn't a show I'd recommend to people who like seeing a lot of progress, as the whole situation of them trying to uncover the seventh might seem like the characters are running around in circles. However, some characters are worth observing in action as they've got great skills to show off.\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, though, the ending has much to ask for. It leaves room for a continuation of the series in a not-so-original fashion and I'm not sure if there'll be one. Many people have told me the anime isn't that great of an adaptation of the light novel, though, so if you'd like a better experience that would be the way to go.",

            "content": "Rokka: Braves of the Six Flowers focuses on a group of six chosen warriors called the Six Braves tasked to slay the leader of the demon race known as the Demon King. However in an unusual series of events, there are seven Braves gathered together and one among the group is an impostor suspected of working on behalf of the demon race. This mystery serves as the major storyline for much of the show's run as the Braves try to determine who among them is the fake. Many of the characters within the series fulfill certain archetypes typical of this storytelling style with our majorleads of focus, Adlet and Fremy, getting major focus as the series focuses on their developing bond and how their current situation tests their trust in one another. While I didn't mind Adlet as our hero of focus as he struggles to clear any suspicion of being the fake chosen warrior, I wasn't too convinced of his budding relationship with Fremy since there's limited development in the relationship due to the greater focus on the mystery of the fake Brave. The rest of the group don't get as much fleshing out since Adlet and Fremy are the main focus of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the mystery surrounding the fake Brave, much of its focus revolves around Adlet being immediately accused of being the suspect as he tries to clear his name and try assessing events that led to the gathering of the seven Braves, along with any actions from the other Braves that could prove they are really the fake. The series takes its time with Adlet getting in confrontations with each of the Braves to assess their characters and determine if they would have any ulterior motives to being the fake Brave. However, these moments often cause progression in the plot to drag since it felt like there were points where the show's creators were trying to pad out time to fill the anime's twelve episode length. Who is ultimately revealed to be the fake Brave felt too convenient since there were hardly any hints dropped of the mentioned character having their motives. Outside of the series being incomplete after its 12-episode run due to its light novel source material still ongoing as of this review, the series tosses in a plot twist in its final episode that may anger fans due to the issues that came up from the mystery played out with uncovering who the fake Brave was.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Rokka is rather pleasing on the eyes offering nicely drawn scenic shots and detailed character designs, with muscle tone being depicted with a number of the Braves' character designs. While not seen too often due to the show being more focused on its mystery plot, the designs of demons are varied and have a good amount of detail to them in spite of the CG animation used for their rendering sticking out like a sore thumb. Animation is fluid for the most part in the series, with characters moving about at a fluid pace and showing off some intense looking action scenes coming off the varying magical and combative abilities of the characters. Much like the demons, some of these magical abilities are rendered in CG animation such as Nashetania's blades and the swamp animals spewed out of Chamo's stomach.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm mostly indifferent to Rokka. While the series attempts to go for something different for its fantasy-adventure genre with its mystery plot, the pacing for it felt dragged out, the majority of the characters don't get much in the way of fleshing out and the revelation of who the fake Brave is was rather lackluster due to the lack of foreshadowing to it. It's a decent time killer for what it offers up, but I'd be hard pressed to recommend rewatching it.",

            "content": "\"Rokka no Yuusha,\" I thought you were supposed to be fighting fiends?\r\nHello everybody, and welcome to another review of mine! If you care to read the summary before reviews, you would know that this anime centers around Adlet Meyer, self proclaimed 'Strongest Man in the World'. In a universe where an ancient Demon God was sealed away by the Goddess of Fate, Adlet aims to be one of \"the Braves of Six Flowers\" to fight the Demon God and keep the fiends at bay upon his reawakening. However, after meeting up with the other Braves, there turns out to be, not six, but...seven?! One isa fake! And so the anime tells its story. \\n\\n\r\nStory ~7~:\\n\r\nI am all for a mystery tale~ Especially if its told in a fantasy setting, what a steal! The anime focuses solely on the question of why there might be seven Braves when there's only supposed to be six. It skips needless travel time that doesn't help the plot at all. Something I was very grateful for since I despise shows that focus all on the travelling and never get to the plot until the second season *cough*AkatsukinoYona*cough* And so for the first of many episodes, the story remained wonderfully focused on the Braves fighting amongst themselves.\\n\r\nHowever, no story is perfect and this one certainly isn't. A development happened between two characters that would have needed more time spent on the travel between destinations. I was very angered that the creator implemented this into the story when there was no previous development leading up to it. These characters interactions were very limited, and what happened between them just didn't add up with the scenes the viewer was presented. \\n\r\nAnd when the fake Brave was finally revealed, the same problem arose. How? How was the viewer supposed to guess this from the limited scenes they were in? The fake Brave definitely needed some more background that they did not receive. \\n\\n\r\nArt ~8~:\\n\r\nThis show's art is absolutely breathtaking. The character's looks and movements are so detailed and fluid. Even the backdrops were given special attention. The CGI in the anime definitely does not distract, so that's a good thing. In some scenes, I did question the animators' background choices, as it looked like characters were stuck in a room with the walls painted at points, but those scenes were few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nSound ~7~:\\n\r\nI have never seen an anime with only 12 episodes have so many OPs and EDs. I had trouble keeping track at first. Like \"Wait, did I hear that song before? Am I going crazy?\" No, I wasn't going crazy, but while watching the show the songs seem to blend a bit before one recognize they're not the same as the previously played song. The songs are plain and not all that interesting. Once you listen to them enough you'll know them enough to start singing along to them. (I'm actually listening to them all in a playlist just so I can remember how they go to write this section. Shhh don't tell anyone!) The soundtrack, which I cannot find on YouTube to listen to is nice, and definitely suited for a fantasy story. Which might be why I like the fantasy genre so much anyway. Besides magic. Everyone knows magic is bae. Anyway. Music is good. Woo.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter ~6~:\\n\r\nCharacters! WOOO BOY. First of all. DEVELOPMENT. Yeah, there's hardly any development with the characters. The audience knows just enough of their history to get by, but we don't know these characters, really. And that's why the many different relationships between them just don't make any sense. But I guess this is what the creator wanted as it makes me want to read the manga. Now, that said, it's not like there weren't good characters. Some had no backstory or development *cough*Goldov*cough* but others, like our main character had plenty. I'm just glad Adlet wasn't a dull main character. Those can be pretty boring to watch. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment ~9~:\\n\r\nMan, it's like anime is just a promotion for the creator's manga series or something. Yes, I very much enjoyed this anime. I watched it while I was supposed to be spending time with my boyfriend. I downloaded six episodes to watch on a plane ride (and I only got to finish 3 of those six). And then I stay up till God knows what time in the morning to complete the series. Yikes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall ~7~:\\n\r\nI enjoyed it, but even I can admit it's an anime with flaws. MAL's 7.4 or whatever rating for it is actually dead on. It's a great show that paves the way for the manga. It's interesting, and yet frustrating as it doesn't live up to the full potential that I want it to have cause I am just God of the animes or something. \\n\\n\r\nBASICALLY\\n\\n\r\nIf you like fantasy shows, give this a watch. It's not bad, by all means. It's a show that one shouldn't expect more from. It's exactly what it says it is. A story about six heroes, and when they find a seventh, it's mortal combat! Literally. There's hardly any fighting of fiends. Although I guess there's enough to satiate the desire to destroy non-human creatures. \\n\\n\r\n~Now for more personal opinions no one asked for~\\n\r\nFavorite Ship: Hans X Adlet (gotta love that BxB)\\n\r\nFavorite Character: Hans (Nyaa!)\\n\r\nFavorite Song: \"Secret Sky\" by MICHI (seriously, this had me interested from the start)",

But I found myself bored to death by the style and the characters annoyed me. Despite this, I would recommend for one reason. There's a character called Hans Humpty whose a normal bloke over than the fact he's a neko and makes the worst cat puns. He's hilarious. There's a scene where (no spoilers) he jumps of a roof of the temple and screams \"nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, etc\" as he slashes his weapons. It was honestly one of the simultaneouslybest and worst scenes I have ever scene.\\n\r\nThe ending sucks tbh, (no spoilers) one of the characters that shows up in the last scene has the stupidest outfit I've ever seen and is honestly one of the most repulsive characters I've ever seen, and I've watched Paranoia Agent.\\n\r\nWould I watch it if they made a second season? Probably not, I figured out who the villain was in the first few episodes (mainly of the posters, I hated the villains style and just said they would be the villain.). That's not saying everyone will, but if you play enough games or know the tropes you can guess. So I'm not optimistic I would enjoy a second season without the guarantee of the stupid nyah-ing humpty dumpty partakes in.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, just watch in for the cat assassin man.",

            "content": "For starters notice that I rated this anime 10/10 so it must have included my personal preferences. This review is spoiler free.\r\nStory (10/10)\r\nRokka no Yuusha is a story of how the 6 heroes are told to gather but 7 came, 12 episodes are spent on finding out the identity of the 7th (or maybe like 8 episodes because the first few episodes are prologues). The mystery aspect is really interesting to a lot of people, so most people watched it expecting they might had their share of fun trying to find out who the culprit is. But even for me that rarely read or watchmytery genres, the mystery genre is a bit stupid. Some things are happening out of nowhere that might've been a huge clue to the mystery.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nThe art is really great, good character designs, some minor thing that puts me off was how some important effects are made in CG instead of hand-drawn. To make my point clearly, it was the saint of blades' blades, it doesn't look like a blade at all, and more like a weird spiky white thing flying in the air. And speaking of character designs, the heroes design was really well made, except for one person. Well you will know what I mean by watching it.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nNothing much to say, the soundtrack is good. And the op/ed is quite good too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\r\nThe characters had some unique personalities, great backstory too. The only downfall was how it was not covering all 7 heroes enough. Some of the heroes didn't have their backstory explained at all. But for me that is understandable because the story wasn't actually finished.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nI think Rokka no Yuusha is standing perfectly between fantasy-adventure, action, and mystery. I loved the setting of Rokka no Yuusha, about how there are saints and demon god, the mayan setting is also a really unique nuance in anime. The mystery was a bit too easy, and sometimes breaks its own logic, like how a simple premise might destroy the whole assumptions that's been going of how the events happened. But mystery is not the only thing Rokka no Yuusha got, the action scene was really good too, not overly relying on magic or superpowers but still had some of that aspects.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\r\nIt might be weird to rate it 10/10 despite how many rants I just made. But I just loved the balanced between the genres: fantasy-adventure, mystery, and action. It might not be the best action there is (yeah I'm looking at you FSN UBW) or the best mytery plot. But it stands inbetween perfectly (just my opinion). And thats why I rated it 10/10.",

            "content": "A mystery, action, magic, fantasy anime. A ranking of #921 on MAL. A Pony Canyon Production (The producers of \"Attack of Titan\", \"Fairy Tail\", \"Clannad\"...). I really was optimistic about this anime and was looking forward to watching it. Now guess? \r\nYes, I didn't like it. I was so disappointed. True it wasn't that bad, but when you have high expectations, even the slightest bad can change your opinion completely.  This time, a review on a rather new anime, ROKKA NO YUUSHA. \r\n Plot and Story Line \r\nThis is again one of the stories based on an old legend, with a bit magic anda couple of heroes. Tough it differs a bit and has it's special taste. Now, off to the plot! \\n\r\nThe story is set in, let's say, ancient times. The temples and backgrounds do kinda look like the towns of the Maya or the Incas. I loved the setting for this anime. In such old times, legend were a normal thing. On one of those legends is our anime based on. It's been told that when the Demon God awakens from the depths of darkness, the Goddess of Fate will select six heroes and bequeath them with the power to save the world. One of those heroes is also our main protagonist Adlet, that claims to be the strongest man in the world. He is a skillful fighter with a little trick here and there. He has a very unique fighting style but gets locked away after getting into a fight with the strongest warriors of the kingdom. What a will, I would say. \\n\r\nWhile being in custody one night, the time to choose the new generation of the Brave Six came. He was one of the lucky ones to get a blossom tattoo on his hand along with the princess of the kingdom whom he's met some time ago. They start they journey together and hit it off with each other right from the beginning. Their first goal is to find the other four Braves and then draw into the battle against the Demon God together. \\n\r\nFinally united the Braves realize something very unnatural. There are seven of them. One is a fake. One is the enemy. And they have to figure out who that one is. \\n\r\nThe anime is interesting in the beginning, but as episodes go on it becomes kinda boring. It does keep you on tenterhooks and you can't wait to hear who the \"Seventh\" one is but I found it rather boring. At some time in the anime I even gave up guessing who the fake is. All their theories become stupid, and the \"magic-action-fantasy\" anime becomes just a stupid and boring wannabe Sherlock Holmes. Don't think it's a spoiler now, but even the final theory about who the fake is, is so dull and it doesn't make any sense. It really gave the show the final blow to the self-destruction. \\n\r\nThere have been some bright moments, and by that, I mean the rare but good action and fight scenes. I was so looking forward to the fight with the Demon God but the whole Sherlock Holmes act, ruined the story that the anime was actually about in the beginning. You get the feeling that the makers wanted to solve the problem about the seventh very quickly, but got lost in doing so, and forgot what they actually wanted to do. Please! \\n\r\nNow there is one more segment of the story that kinda brightened it up a little. It's the relationship development between Adlet and Fremy. From hatred to love and trough a deep character development. A side story about self-acceptance and finding a place you belong. Now is there something better. True it also got annoying by the time just as every other part of the story. \\n\r\nOn the whole, the story is good, I can't deny. But it got boring in time. It was not as good as I expected and the whole guessing who the fake is part put the main story and the very intriguing legend part into the shadow.  \\n\\n\r\n Animetion and Style \\n\r\nAh, 2015. What a beautiful year full of awesome animation. Just remember Gangsta and God Eater, then Noragami Aragoto, and don't forget Death Parade and Tokyo Ghoul (A). They all share a beautiful and detailed animation and style, and let me now ask you! What on Earth happened to Rokka no Yuusha. The animation is so poor in colors and details. The style is on a 2006 level, and Code Geass is even better than this being from 2006. There are some beautiful views, but they are very rare. And besides, the only interesting character looks are the ones from Fremy and princess Nashetania (and I am really not sure about the second one because it lines with a cliche look). I expected a better job here, but okay...\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nOn the whole the anime Rokka no Yuusha is not bad, but it also isn't that good. I really expected it to be better especially because of the legend and heroes stuff but I was disappointed in the end. There are some good parts, no denying. So in short now. If you like mystery and anime where there is, let's say, a case to be solved Rokka no Yuusha would be an awesome recommendation for you. But if you want a good legend and an adventure don't watch this. Instead try Akatsuki no Yona or No Game No Life, that would be way better.\\n\\n\r\nYour AnimeGirl",

However, this anime has failed to make good use of all these great elements by giving us a drab and dragging plot-line.\r\nThe characters also fail to connect (at least with me) until the very end. Only Adlet is the relate-able one in the bunch. The other characters seem to be just patch-ups or buffers to make him seem to have more depth.\r\nI expected this show to have a lot of action and intense plot-twistsbut it didn't deliver that. They were talking 80% of the time which is weird given that this anime should be heavy on the genre of Action, Fantasy and Adventure and not Slice of Life or even Drama. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not horrible. At the same time, it isn't great either. \\n",

Then about 4 or 5 episodes in, it throws in a twist that changed the nature of the series and made me think it had even more potential to go down a dark and unique path. Then around episode 10 or so you realize you're just watching a formulaic locked-room mystery with a fantasy coat of paint. Then, after solvingthe mystery in the last episode, there's a last-minute twist that completely undermines the solution and renders the whole thing ridiculous, just for the sake of adding in another girl to the MC's harem and providing a limp sequel hook for a second season.

I was pleasantly surprised at how wrong I was because it was actually really good quality, I would say this is really one of the better shows I've watched in a while.   \r\nStrong points\r\n1) The music in this show is really good, it's so well done that it was immediately one of the things I noticed the most while watching, and that usuallynever happens early on.  All in all every situation and scenario was backed up by some impressive music.\\n\\n\r\n2) The main plot of the story actually has some suspense and mystery that keeps you wanting to watch more with each episode, it is very consistent throughout the show and the pacing is really excellent.  It was fresh and entertaining throughout each episode, with a good balance of some light-heartedness mixed in with an overall serious and mature tone carrying out the main script.  No cheap gimmicks or stupid nonsensical scenarios digressing from the progression of events, nothing embarassing or shameful really being presented here (despite some character designs which I'll briefly mention later...).\\n\\n\r\n3) The anime was executed very well and this is its strongest point.  I have to say I was really impressed by the way critical events were presented.  All of the fight scenes were high quality and were really original and well choreographed.  They were creative and entertaining with some solid animation, which even implemented some CGI!  Even simple stand offs were backed with heavy dialogue because the stakes behind each conversation were suspenseful.  Even the romantic aspects of this show were done very well and it was extremely well implemented and subtle.  It was \"intelligent.\"  The conversations that occurred throughout the show really had some substance.  The script writing and mono/dialogues were really excellent at times.  One can definitely tell that the entire 12 episodes was written and carried out meticulously to provide one quality package, even at times highlighting small details shown in previous episodes. \\n\\n\r\n4) Some of the characters were actually well done in terms of character development and uniqueness (and some were very generic).  They were all presented well and each one had a clear sense of character & individuality.  Each had a fair amount of evenly distributed screen time as well.    \\n\\n\r\n-Small note but there is also some small amount of film editing done here at times as well.  It's really not that big of a deal, but just thought I'd like to point that out because I can appreciate those small details.  It just adds to the flavor that there was a certain amount of effort put into this show and gives a sense of atmosphere to anyone curious about the quality of presentation. \\n\\n\r\nWeak points\\n\\n\r\n1) The premise leading up to the main plot of the story is really really weak.  It's a typical, cliche-like background story of heroes fighting evil, but that's only used as a setting.  Surprisingly enough, the focus of the entire show is something much more complex, sinister, and surprisingly entertaining, at least for this 12 show period.\\n\\n\r\n2) The clothing for Nashatania & Fremy was really distracting, so much so that I have to list this aspect as a weak point.  I would even go as far to say, if all the character designs in this show were a little more appealing, desirable, inspiring, and original in my eyes, this would have been an easy overall 8 instead of a 7 in my book.  That's how much it bothered me at times.  It's even stranger because really there is literally no blatant fanservice in this show, it's just an issue with those two character's models.  It's weird because the show takes itself and everything which occurs throughout seriously, but because of those two designs in particular it made me feel more detached to what was going on than I actually wanted to be since everything else was done so well!  \\n\\n\r\n3) Out of all 7 characters, really only a few of them were interesting.  Hopefully there will be a 2nd season which either strengthens some of the weaker character's developments, or either introduces new and interesting characters.     \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end this is how I felt after watching.  To sum up my feelings, this show has so many strong points but is minorly flawed due to the show's poor choices in overall character designs and models.  I really felt there was too strong of a contrast here.  If we're talking about just presentation and execution of the show though, there's really no shortage of good quality here.  Even though the overall story is really bland and uninspiring, it speaks volumes for the quality in the way the actual show was presented in terms of execution.  One of the better shows out there, which left me wanting more.",

The mix of na interesting but kind of clich\u00e9 fantasy with a mistery story cl\u00edmax resulted in a very interesting anime.\r\nThe animation is the best part, the fights are good and there are few bugs in it.\r\nBesides some unnecessary moments everything was doing Ok. But that end... that screw up all my experience. It's an open end... it means that the story hasn't finish at ALL... and the worst part is that it will not have a second season.\r\nI liked the characters and the way that the abilities are not overpower. The maincharacter is a good one. But that horrible end made me to score 4... and I am really sad about it, I could even score 3.

There is a prophecy that says when the Demon Lord comes back six heroes will be chosen (the Brave of Six Flowers) and they all have to meet up at a temple in the land of howling demons. But when they all meet up there are seven heroes instead of six, and that's were all the thinking work starts. \r\nIn a way this is a very interesting anime, plot wise as well as story flow wise. But for me it just didn't get to the point. In fact it felt like a game of cluedo, and withthe synopses given you'd expect an epic adventure were the heroes fight the demon lord and someone died, and that caused someone else to unleash a power of epic proportion. \\n\\n\r\nBut no, it's just a huge thing about playing detective and blaming everyone around them.

            "content": "I can't believe that I didn't get around to watching this anime until a YEAR after it aired. This show is definitely at the top of my \"anime that need another season\" list, and the translated online novel I read was also really good. Now that the Light Novels have been licensed I've pre-ordered the second novel and am waiting for the first. I love reading books and this is definitely one of the best Light Novel series I've read.\r\nI love Mysteries and I love Fantasies, growing up with Shonen Jump Action-Adventures I'd always wanted the shows in question to delve further into the plot-twistelement in a detective-like fashion, and before Rokka, the closest that I'd got was the Soul Society Arc of Bleach. Rokka stands on its own merits beyond filling that ever-so-specific niche for me, however. \\n\\n\r\nAs a big fan of mystery shows Rokka was refreshing in how it followed the basic rules of mystery writing to a tee, save for the use of the romantic-interest. The main draw of a mystery-show was \"that the viewer should be able to try and figure out the mystery as well as the characters provided that said viewer is Shrewd and Willing to do so\" (quote one of the rules of writing detective fiction that I read while doing research, it sums up my own personal enjoyment quite nicely) and when it first turned to the locked room mystery I was a bit hesitant that they would pull a \"magic trick out of thin air trick\" to explain the situation but through clever exposition and world-building the magic system is explained to the extent that it can be seen as a legitimate mechanic and the last-minute revelation of the initial fog being a dummy to throw everyone off guard was a good twist to throw in. Also of note was the absence of one of my biggest pet peeves in Detective Conan: the detective coming across a clue by random chance instead of on merit of logical deduction and observation and knowledge. In Rokka what we get instead is an ah-ha moment of Adlet figuring out the fog-mechanic which is much more tolerable and closer to the rules of writing a good mystery as opposed to having lady luck stuff a clue in the detective's, and thus the viewer's, face.\\n\\n\r\nI think that the mystery element really sells how intelligent and dangerous the Fiends/Kyouma really are as a threat. In most stories the inhuman threat come across as dangerous because of their inhuman powers and supernatural abilities, but in this world they are presented not as overly egotistical Beastmen or lumbering near-immortal Titans but as a force that is intelligent and crafty enough to trap the only ones capable of defeating them in a locked room but also to plant a spy to sow discord and mistrust so that they would kill each other. Though I am aware that their is a good percent of Kyouma who are lacking in intelligence that doesn't change the fact that their is a highly intelligent force that commands legions of supernatural, horned entities all for the sake of winning a war against humanity.\\n\\n\r\nNone-of-that takes away from the action, in fact I would say that the action is definitely a highlight of the anime despite happening so little. All of the action scenes are well animated, directed and choreographed with the battle of Hans and Adlet vs Chamo being one of my favourite fights in this show. That being said its a good thing that the action isn't overly intrusive on the main appeal of this show: the mystery.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I re-watched the series I was able to pick apart and take a real good look at all of the little hidden clues that the series tossed at you ahead of time; pieces of what were initially treated as throw-away lines or just the basic world building and character establishment that were the game\\n\r\nchanging clues to clue the viewer in on who the seventh really was.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the series lacks is in the characters, I would say that they are a decent 7 myself, but not all of them have been fleshed out to be as interesting as others. I am aware that they are further developed and given more nuance in the novels, but until the anime gets more seasons\\n\r\n(which I am really pushing) they are an unfortunate flat note. The 3D CG was also handled a lot better than in most other shows, though I do not usually like it when they are mixed in here it was done a lot better and I think that the teams behind this anime were trying to make the Fiends/Kyouma as uncanny as possible to sell them as an alien threat, a species that is able to remind one of basic inhuman enemies in similarly crafted premises but trying to make them stand out. In any case I've certainly seen worse, and because only a few episodes actually featured the Kyouma specifically I'd say that this CGI is quite tolerable.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of my scores for the individual parts that MAL provides up top are over all score is that the story,  mystery, action and my own personal enjoyment is a 10, the sound and music are a good 9, the art only being boggled down by semi-OK CG is an 8 in 2D and a 4 or 5 in 3D.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to anyone who likes to make theory crafting about plot-twists about action-adventure anime/manga and invite you to flex your critical thinking muscle to try and figure out the mystery and to people who have long wanted to find a mystery show that is able to balance out the mystery and fantasy element with the fantasy interfering with the mystery.",

            "content": "Rokka no Yuusha is one of those find-the-imposter thriller mysteries where a group casts suspicion on each other while trying to uncover who the one traitor is. These sorts of stories are very difficult to pull off well, because without proper balancing of suspicion on multiple levels, the viewer can easily start reducing the number of plausible culprits early on. If the balancing is particularly bad, the viewer figures out who the culprit is almost immediately. Whatever the case, once the viewer figures it out, the mystery loses almost all of its appeal. There's still a certain amount of entertainment in just watching it playout, but it's not much.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, I would say that Rokka no Yuusha got the balance right. That's my opinion anyways. I did not find it particularly obvious who the culprit would be in the end. Generally, the rule of thumb with these sorts of mysteries is that the culprit ends up being the character who you think it is least likely to be, besides the main character. However, in Rokka no Yuusha, each character gets enough suspicion placed on them at times that it was never clear to me just who the culprit was until the very end. Many times throughout the anime, I thought I had it figured out, but I kept changing my mind right up until the very end. I think it depends pretty heavily on the viewer's perception, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was really nice as well. I was actually expecting the story to reach the mystery from early on (the end of Ep1 or the start of Ep2), then progress to the defeat of the demon lord, but it actually started very slowly, introducing the characters as it progressed and laying out some of their backstories. I think the largest complaints for the show being obvious come from this slow opening and how the characters introduced late are therefore not as likely to be the culprit. I didn't feel that this was an issue, though. While some of the characters were not well-developed enough, they all still felt equally suspicious throughout the confusion.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest complaint is actually with the ending. Since the pacing was so slow, the entire anime only encompasses the lead up to the meeting of the 6+1 heroes and the confusion that ensues. The quest to defeat the demon lord is never actually covered, with the end being when the culprit has been revealed. However, they really needed to come up with a better way to tie it off after the big reveal. The actual ending was so dorky it left me feeling disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, an extra note on the characters. Many of them weren't particularly well-developed outside of qualities that encourage the viewer to feel confused about their potential innocence and/or guilt. However, I thought that Fremie was a very interesting character. They did a particularly good job with her backstory; good enough that it would be interesting to see a spin-off based solely on her story.",

It's ridiculously cliche, why would they write something that like this? But, there's a twist. Suddenly the seventh hero appeared outta nowhere, they suspected that one of them to be the fake hero. Apparently, the only way to tell that they were chosen is thatthere's some kind of tattoo that appeared to indicate they were chosen. All seven of them appeared to have the tattoo, so instead of fighting the demon king or whatever, they decided to find out who's the fake one for like 7 episodes.

Well I wouldn't necessarly say Rokka No Yuusha did the genre wrong... They certainly made some rookie mistakes that ruined the series for me... This review will contain no spoilers so if you haven't watched the anime yet don't worry. \r\nThe mystery genre can be a tricky genre to do right as it generally takes a pretty smart person and some knowledge on the mystery genre to be ableto properly leave hints and clues. You have to scatter random pieces of information and figure out ways to make sure the viewer overlooks it as it's a small detail or random information at the time. Rokka No Yuusha did this pretty well, figuring out how they did it was a little bit hard and entertaining. However the problem lied in figuring out who did it... Just from having a basic knowledge of the genre you can tell who did it. One of the worst things you can do in the mystery genre is not give EVERY single one of your characters a reason to why they could and couldn't have done it. Everybody needs to be under suspicion or it's gonna draw some major attention to the one person who's not. This is where the anime went wrong. They left a certain character to just sit back and act like there was no way they could have done it. They tried to make the character go unseen and forgotten about so much that they made it obvious on who it was. Everything else about this anime was great, the artwork, the characters, the music etc. However that one rookie mistake kind of ruined the plot of the anime for me.\\n\\n\r\nI do recommend Rokka No Yuusha though, like I said everything else was perfect, the artwork, the characters even the few fight scenes. This anime may not be the best in the mystery side but it certainly excels in other departments to still make this anime enjoyable and worth watching.",

            "content": "Wow! Rokka no Yuusha, what a ride that has been!\r\nIf there is any caveat I can give, don't start the first 3 episodes or you wont be able to stop. E.g. watching through the whole night not sleeping then as the morning comes your guardian expresses her sheer disappoin... whoops\r\nAnyway, let us talk about the story and plot. The storytelling is your usual mystery anime, your usual cliffhangers at the end of some episodes. What vexes me the most is how the plot moves for the worst, yet somehow things work out. Truly splendid writing right there.\r\nThe art was the most lackluster part of thisanime but still pretty good and better than other anime's artwork. Moreover, it doesn't really affect enjoyment of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound oh the sound! Maybe it's just me, but my heart was racing throughout the episodes, and I figured the soundtrack must've had a part in it. That being said, the EP and OP were rather jejune and easily forgotten. Regardless the soundtrack was on point and complimented the enjoyment of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were unique for the most part, but somehow they're not close to being riveting. Perhaps this was because it was just one bite of the cake? The most interesting character for now is of course our protagonist Adlet (uhh the long hair throws me off). He keeps on saying he is the world's strongest man, is he? The character development sadly like most 12-episode anime falls very short, but we see a few glimpses every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it? Of course, I did exchange my precious sleep just to finish this, and I bet my life you would (okay I don't have one, I mean I'm on MAL afterall ;)).\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyable anime series. It had some nice chicks btw, I mean isn't that what we're all here for hehehe 9/10 zzzzz",

            "content": "This is just a random review I wrote a little while back. Please note that I wrote this at 4 in the morning and it has been quite a while since I have watched the series. I hope you enjoy this rambling review. \r\nRokka no Yuusha is an anime that I heavily enjoyed, but I have many problems with the series itself. \r\nThe story of Rokka no Yuusha itself is fairly well executed and went at the perfect pace for what the show was going for. The series actually takes its time, and it's quite splendid. We get to delve more into the characters andwe get to take in the narrative as it slowly unravels. \\n\\n\r\nThough contrary to popular opinion, I believe the first 3-4 episodes actually weren't half bad, and worked for the story. It may have seemingly 'typical fantasy adventure', but there was something a bit uneasy about these episodes. The colour pallet is very dulled, and there's just this sense of uncertainty in the characters and setting. It was off, and a normal fantasy adventure series isn't necessarily like that. \\n\\n\r\nOnce the all the braves got together, that's when everything became a bit more exciting. This was where the real juice of the series started. It went from a semi unsettling adventure series to a mystery thriller series. \\n\r\nThis is quite different from the typical fantasy anime, and I honestly appreciate that. It's something different. \\n\r\nAll the personalities clash and tension and paranoia arise. We see this characters who don't know one another try and figure out who's the imposter. It's an interesting battle of wit, and we, as viewers, don't really know who to believe either. All we know about these characters is what they put forth and how they generally present themselves.  We know just as much as the characters know, and that's what makes this part of the narrative work. \\n\\n\r\nWhen they ultimately blame Adlet, we get to see more excitement and more sides to these characters. The show is still on a high of excitement thrills and interesting conversation. \\n\\n\r\nIs Adlet really the false brave? If not, then who is it? Is it Mora? Is it Nashetania? Is it Goldov? Is it Hans? Is it Chamo? Is it Fremy? Only time would tell. \\n\\n\r\nThe reveal of the false brave worked, and I honestly didn't see it coming. Maybe I was possibly too naive to notice, but I will give props to the writers on this one. \\n\r\nEach character was a bit insane, so anyone would have made sense. But it was Nashetania, a princess, but she was actually influenced by this Demon God to commit these acts. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the series is a piece of rubbish, quite frankly. It ends just exactly how it started: there is another false brave. Why they decided to do this is beyond me. Why is cow girl a bloody brave? Who the hell is second false brave? Since I basically don't ever touch the source material, and the series did terribly in Japan, I will probably never find out. The series would have just been better off with just ending when Nashetania fled, and the six braves head to battle the Demon God. But no, let's make this more of a bloody commercial. Great, just great.  \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves feel more like glimpses at who they are, and the series doesn't explore most of them to great depth. Yes, this makes sense considering it's a mystery series, and it may have given away the false brave more easily. The characters we get to see the most of are Adlet and Fremy. \\n\\n\r\nAdlet claims to be \"the strongest man in the world\" and is a bit of a cocky individual, but he's actually more than that. The series delves into his backstory, and we get to see a different side of his character. This dude has had kind of a shoddy life, but he tries to stay on the more positive side of things. Adlet is a character with actual depth and personality, unlike many protagonists of his ilk. He was actually pretty likeable, and I was actually rooting for him when he was in danger. \\n\\n\r\nThe other character with a decent amount of screen time and depth is Fremy. She, like Adlet, has had a pretty shitty life. Her character is fairly quiet, yet fierce. She is basically an example of a Rei Ayanami clone, but she actually gets some depth, unlike many of the other clones of her type. Fremy was a character that was fun to watch on screen, and it was nice to see her get the spotlight like she did. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I move on to the other members of the cast, I'd like to mention the semi romance subplot between Adlet and Fremy. Honestly, this subplot feels very forced and manufactured. I get why Adlet would try to do this so he Fremy on his side, but it didn't really work for me. The two characters don't really have much chemistry as lovers. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is filled with personality, but we don't get to see much of the individual characters themselves. None of them are really worth mentioning, except for Nashetania. \\n\\n\r\nNashetania is an interesting character. I feel like we know a lot, yet nothing about her character at the same time. I wish we got to delve deeper into this young woman's mind, and we got to see how it worked with a bit of a clearer eye. This woman is mad, and I wanted to see more of her insanity. \\n\r\nOne other thing I'd like to mention is yet again, Nashetania and how she wears armour that resembles that of a rabbit.  In many different cultures, the rabbit is often considered to be a 'trickster'. I didn't realise that when I was watching the series, but it makes sense to have her kind of symbolise that since she was the trickster. She tricked everyone. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is fun, and they all bounce off each other fairly well. Each character feels distinct and rather different from one another. Like with Nashetania, I'd like to see more of these characters, and more of their backstories. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs for this series are honestly a stand out for me. They all make sense for their given character, and can convey their personalities just through the way they look. The designs are also rather well drawn, and have stuck with me for quite sometime. The setting was also quite something. The architecture resembled more of a Mayan or Aztec like society; most fantasy anime have European or Japanese esc architecture. This further differentiated itself from other fantasy anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation for the show is honestly rubbish. It's really horrible. Most of the show kind of is just awkward to watch, and it's very off-putting. There's not much movement, and when there is, it is really bad. \\n\r\nThe CG they use in this show looks like it's from a crappy PS2 game. It's ugly, and makes me want to vomit. \\n\\n\r\nWhy do you do this to me, Rokka no Yuusha? \\n\\n\r\nThe bad animation could have been saved a bit for good cinematography, but sadly that's simply not the case. Most of the shots are fairly flat, static, and boring. It just makes long dialogue scenes harder to watch. Studio Shaft is splendid making long dialogue scenes interesting. You need to make your shots interesting and creative to keep the viewer invested. \\n\r\nThe fight choreography is also rubbish. It's very messy and it's honestly impossible to comprehend what's happening on screen. \\n\\n\r\nThe music was fairly solid, but there was nothing really stand out. The only piece that was notable was the third ending theme. The song was pretty, and it has some nice shots. \\n\r\nThe voice acting was solid too. The voices fit their characters, and the cast seemed to have at least some fun with it. \\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to really think of huge themes for Rokka no Yuusha. This adaptation is only a tiny fraction of the narrative, at least from what I've heard from light novel readers. I suppose that some themes/ideas could be 'be careful of who you put your trust in' or 'it's always the one who you least expect'. I quite frankly don't know. It's been over a year since I've watched this shit. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Rokka no Yuusha is a fun, yet highly flawed series. The series works for its unique setting, interesting characters, and engaging mystery, but fails with a horrid ending and garbage animation.  \\n\\n\r\nI can't really say I'd recommend this to anyone unless you want a different twist on the fantasy genre.\\n\\n\r\n_________________________________\\n\\n\r\nOn an extra note, this is one of the few series where I'd actually prefer it see be remade. I would want it to be handled by Shaft since they know how to make long dialogue scenes interesting, along with creating an unsettling atmosphere. Somehow, I want maybe Mamoru Oshii as the director, and have Akiyuki Shinbou as the chief director. It's probably impossible, but I'd love to see what those two could create together. I think the music should be handled by Yuki Kajiera (you know who I mean). Her style, I believe, would fit really well with that this series is going for. Akio Watanabe's character design would look nice for this series. I'm not really sure who would be involved with the writing, though possibly Dai Sato, but I'm not really sure. \\n\r\nThis staff collection and just the general idea of this getting remade is already impossible, so I'll stop now. \\n\\n\r\nI did this for absolutely nothing.\\n",

Sure, there was civilization inspired with mayan empire, but it was as important to the story as some sophisticated sliding doors in sci-fi porn flick. \r\nWhat's worse is that's the case with most things. MC is a goddamn ninja (yes, mayan ninja. don't think too hard, it fits well with the story.), there are girls with magical powers, thereare demons, prophecies, a decently constructed world overall, and it's all shoved aside for the sake of 8 or so episodes long closed room mystery. With magic.\\n\r\nAnd i'm saying 8 or so instead of 12 because first few episodes only introduce the audience into the world.\\n\r\nThe art, sound, and characters were all good, although for the sake of \"deepening\" the mystery, characters made a splendid show of pretending to be retarded.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe series would be worth the time if there were more episodes, preferably not concentrated on \"Detective Conan in a world with magic that's never explained. have fun, mystery fans\", but on simple journey or relationships building between characters. As it is now, it's good only for showing how to waste a potential you might've grasped when building the world.\\n\\n\r\nI know I should be ending now, but I just can't live it down, cause seriously, SERIOUSLY, why the fuck would you make a closed room mystery IN A WORLD WITH MAGIC. Majority of supernatural isn't even explained. This series could've been great, but it's bullshit with plot like this. It'd be better if it was a fucking sports anime in mayan empire, team playing head-of-our-foe-ball instead of FUCKING GODDAMN MYSTERY. WHY MYSTERY?!? WHY? WHY? WHYYY?\\n\\n\r\nIt's good enough to watch it once, if you don't mind a massive disappointment at the cliffhanger ending with scant hope of another season, and story being adapted from a LN, which will be translated oficially in 2017, and that's the first volume. Or save yourself some gray cells and watch detective conan, since cases there are faster, and some degree of logic can be found there. \\n\r\n*keeps screaming \"WASTED POTENTIAL\" to this day*",

A few of the Braves meet up early and set-off on a journey to find the other, and during the journey they fight a few enemies.  Then once they all meet up, there are a total of seven, but they were supposed to be only 6 Braves.  From that point, the whole story goes down hill in my opinion.  It became a whole new anime, because it was solely focused on who the fake was.  Allof the Braves were suspicious, and it turned into a game of _Who Done It?_  There were a few small fights among them, but the story turned boring for my taste.  The only reason why the anime can be consider a mystery is because one of them is fake, but I did not find it mysterious at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThen there is one of the MC's, Adlet Meyer, that claims to be \"Strongest Man in the World,\" but he is the weakest of the whole group.

            "content": "Although there are already some very good and helpful reviews submitted for this show, I can't help but feel there is a very strong sentiment lacking in the reviews. Let us make very clear once and for all that this show is a \"locked room mystery\" masquerading as a fantasy action show. I think perhaps that is one of the most disappointing aspects of the show. \r\nSo let's come at it from two different angles, with that idea in mind. \r\nAs a fantasy action show, this 12 episode series falls extremely short of the bar. In the first several episodes, it creates an extremely detailedpremise, quirky yet somewhat fulfilling character introductions, and captures the attention for it's quick witted conversation. For example, our introduction to our \"protagonist\" in full detail is held as a discussion in a prison. As far as setting up plot goes, this is a pretty solid go-to. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, we very quickly fall out of favor with this style. A show with such a rich backstory spends the next several episodes (and admittedly, the rest of the series) playing Sherlock Holmes with us. In all honesty it seems as if someone desperately wanted to merge these two genres, but failed to take into account the sort of balancing necessary for such a feat (and why it's so rare in the first place.) \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, we cannot fully condone this show as a fantasy action, seeing as it fails to go anywhere beyond introductory storylines, despite having the well built foundations for such an attempt.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go back to our mystery angle. \\n\\n\r\nThis show then presents to us one of the most classic mystery scenarios: the locked room. Six people destined to show, seven show, one of them is the bad guy. But who? The show tries to run off of logic that is... illogical, at best. Most of the character's refutes are emotionally charged, with no real evidence, and yet the majority of the characters believe the refutes without question. Then, to make matters worse, a romantic pairing is forced upon two of the seven for an uneasy alliance that assists the accused with an easy escape from the corner the writers backed him into.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the show fails on two fronts and claims to deliver more than it is able. If you are looking for a fantasy action show, this is not it. If you are looking for a subpar locked room mystery show with fantasy elements, welcome to the party!",

            "content": "If you're expecting some nice fantasy adventure packed with action, glossy cool magics and some hint of mystery, just like what's written in its genre, then turn around and never come back. This anime is not for you.\r\nFirst of all I'd like to keep my reviews short so let's get to the point with no unnecessary summaries.\r\nRokka no Yuusha is like a lost amnesiac child not knowing where to go, who he is, where did he come from and what to do in the future. It tries to blend fantasy, adventure, action and mystery but ends up mixing a bubbling witch cauldron with contents godknows what. \\n\\n\r\nAgain what was this story about? Oh, it's about a group of 6 braves + 1 disguised enemy among them and it's up to our heroes to find the culprit! Yeah, so much for defeating the evil king, somewhat, somewhere this show became sherlock holmes, but oh, don't expect some exciting, brain-wracking mystery to solve here because none of the characters here apparently uses their brain properly. Very dumb mystery solving story that only manages to move on bathing with a bucketful of red herring. Story doesn't need more elaboration, 2 points speaks enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs is medi- okay I guess with a good choice of color palette and blended well with the ambiance and background. Animation is \"rough\"--too few key frames-- noticeable inconsistency and quality drops quite often. Good clouds though, if only the camera angled more upwards. And lighting was decent too.\\n\\n\r\nBGMs are very very generic and it irritated me up to some point. But at least the ED songs returned some of my sanity, except for 1 song.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters deserves as much hatred as the story. Besides Fremy, they are all stale while some (princess) took a wild, badly-handled U-turn ending up in a messy accident. Sigh. But hey, at least the supporting cast have their own unique color.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a TRUE mystery fan, I pity you. With nothing but red herrings all around the plot, you must have smelled quite bad after 12 episodes. A 5 for making me stay throughout the run.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, not recommended whether you are a mystery, fantasy, action or adventure lover. You are wasting your time here. \\n",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Rokka no Yuusha. This anime was just ok, its hard to say good things about it but it also didn't do a lot wrong in general. To me this anime was just alright, the characters gave me cancer at every turn, and there were some glaring issues with the basis of the mystery section, but again people may not care so much about characters and maybe caught something i didn't with the issues. Either way lets begin.\r\nOur story revolves around a world where a demon god exists whom an old goddess once defeated. She eventually split herpower into six parts and when the Demon god returns six heroes are given the goddesses power. The snag here is that when everyone gathers we find there are seven people claiming to be heroes. Dun dun dun. This sounds pretty interesting to me, its fun watching these types of shows.\\n\\n\r\nNow a series of events unfolds and our heroes find themselves in a mist barrier which not only blocks people from coming from the demon island but stops people from escaping the barrier. This is where out motley band of heroes come and introduce themselves and begin the chase for the seventh member.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was really good and the action very fluid and nice. Soundtrack didn't catch me at all.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters are an intricate part of a mystery show. Our 7 heroes are Speeddraw, Fremy, Mayer, Adlet, Humpty, Hans, Piena Augustra, Nashetania Loei, Rosso, Chamo, Auora, Goldof, Chester, Mora. Fremy is one of those overly cold people who secretly want someone to save them. I absolutely despise characters like her and it was painful to deal with her shenanigans until close to the end. Adlet is a normal person who uses intellect, training, and many devious tactics to win. He calls himself the strongest man in the world and isn't unlikable. Hans is the mysterious cat like assassin who is kinda like Adlet. Nashentania is the princess who uses summoned blades to destroy her enemies. Chamo is the swamp loli who is overly eager and thinks shes so strong that she constantly picks fights with people. Again way overplayed to the point of annoyance. Goldof is the loyal knight of Nashetania and plays the unrequited love knight role. Lastly we have Mora who is basically the boss of all these saint's(people who received powers from gods. Chamo and Nashentania). Shes powerful but also very stubborn and uses trickery a few times. She was here to be a fallback to the mystery. Once you watch you'll see what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nIf the characters wouldn't have been created with such toxic characteristics to achieve suspicion I might have actually liked this anime. Danganronpa wasn't the best mystery I've ever watched but the way they handle mystery and characters were 20X better than this. Each character is designed to be used to raise the watchers suspicions until the last episode. However if you think about trying to think outside the box you will figure out the real culprit at about episode 3(when the mystery begins). You wont be able to be apart of the investigation as its never truly explained and you basically have to guess until the last two episodes when they unfold everything for you.\\n\\n\r\nTo top of the easy to guess, and hard to follow plot twist we have issues with the premise of this mystery. Our mystery revolves around a building created by the saint of salt. It was created in secret and hardly anyone knew anything about it(The characters admit this at the very start). However once the shit begins to hit the fan it seems everyone but Adlet has extensive knowledge about a certain section of the building and its inner workings. They use some background character info to try and patch this up but its not well done because in a room full of potential liars who would believe unconditionally information given about a secret building. That being sad, try it, and see for yourself, a lot of people liked the characters I hated so I think that may increase your enjoyment a lot. Also that ending though, wishful thinking that they will get a second season.(I would watch it though)\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Annoying character, maybe? Silly early plot hole. No following the action, it unfolds all in one episode at the end. Easy to guess the culprit. Art was great though. give it a watch if you have free time.",

            "content": "Spoiler Free Review*\r\nI'm always bad at starting reviews, so I'll just jump into the thick of it. Rokka No Yuusha's pretense and world are pretty standard in the fantasy genre, and because of this can be explained and absorbed easily. The characters of this world are pretty interesting. Many suffer from under development or fitting an archetype, but some are given quite a great deal of depth. Then the story itself had a setup I particularly liked, but overall fell short in my opinion. These areas (Story and Characters) are where i'll be focusing on, since to me they are the most important aspects ofany show.\\n\\n\r\nThe setup of Rakka no Yuusha is the age old tale of many JRPGs. A demon god wishes to take over the world, and only you and your party can complete the quest to defeat him and save the land. However, here is where things change. Rokka no Yuusha's predominant focus is not on this quest, but on a major complication that happens to the party. I won't count this as a spoiler since it's in the synopsis, but there are 7 Pokemon in our hero's party. Thus begins the mystery of discovering who the fake hero is. Everything so far sound great? Well here is why I wouldn't give the anime above a 6. The entire plot turns into ass pulls and poor setups, which in a mystery show are straight up insulting. From gigantic plot holes, to withholding crucial information from the viewer, this anime completely fails the mystery genre. Since the entire second half of the plot is dedicated to this mystery, the show suffers immensely. However, all of this hits the viewer in the final 2 episodes, and to be honest the trip to those episodes was very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nNext are the characters. The development of characters varies majorly among the main cast, and this is something I particularly didn't like. First we have our MC Adlet, who is the self-proclaimed \"Strongest Man in the World\". He for the most part is a typical over-confident lead like Kirito, Tatsume, or Yusuke. However, he does go beyond the archetype in many ways, and by the end of the show i really did enjoy his character. The only other character to be fully developed is Fremy, who is a very interesting character to follow. Her personality is pretty unique, and she is a character who actually felt human to me. The rest of the characters, maybe with the exception of the assassin Hans, are not given enough screen time to be developed to any useful extent, thus fall into default archetype roles. Even still, the characters are one of the things which raised this show up. The interactions between them are fluid, and quite a bit of drama and story telling comes just from these interactions. Particularly the relationship between Adlet and Fremy, and Han's quest out of the generic shady guy archetype.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Rokka no Yuusha is a rollercoaster. It starts incredibly strong, and sets a really high precedent for the rest of the series, but then drops in quality quite a bit, and looks very lazy by the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing too special, the VA was pretty good and the ost was decent, so there really isn't much more to say about that.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I really did enjoy this anime for a large part of its 12 episodes. The setting was cool, some of the characters were interesting, and I was genuinely curious about the mystery and how it would effect their quest. However the last few episodes just fell flat, and the ending was the author reaching out of your monitor and bitch-slapping you.",

At the end, there is a big twist but nothing leading up to it, kind of like when a fan-fic author decides to make their story go a certain direction but can't edit the beginning parts of the story because they've already published it online. \r\nThe character design is poor. It seems the author put more effort into their outfits and styles than their actual personalities. The main character is extremely annoying. Can you imagine hanging out with someone who bragsabout themselves every five minutes? You'd think that if they really were the strongest man in the world, they wouldn't feel the need to point that out. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea of the show isn't bad, but it feels like a first draft that somehow got published before anyone had time to edit it.",

The pace slows the a crawl for each episode as conflict after conflict arises for no apparent reason, incited by dipshit andbraindead characters with an inexplicable \"shoot first and ask questions later\" mentality. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the answer to the central mystery of the show is fucking trash. The most obvious suspect is actually the culprit; there was never really any mystery to begin with. You'll be left staring at the screen in disbelief as the show acts as if this insulting answer is some insane plot twist straight out of The Matrix; it felt like the show had shat on me, spat on me and given me the middle finger - all at once.

This would have been fine IF this little mystery didn't constitute the bulk of this story. And i was so simple a child could figure it out. Before we break that down I wanna mention the monsters (which take a back seat when it's mystery time) are dull and uninspired and several character designs make you question what exactly do they think people wear in combat? Okay, let's break down this mystery to showcase whyIt gets a two out of five.\\n\r\nThere's seven and one MUST be a fake. After two episodes of this I came to the following conclusions: \\n\r\n[spoiler]\\n\r\nAdlet our main character from episode one. Obviously he's not the fake (though that would have been a great twist)\\n\r\nFlamie the half demon girl? The saint killer? the very obvious FIRST person anyone would suspect\\n\r\nHans while a confessed assassin seems untrustworthy, that fact alone made it too obvious it wasn't him\\n\r\nChamot she seems homicidal enough but nothing about her character indicates subversion is her strong point\\n\r\nMora two things ruled her out, She seems smart enough to not fall into her own trap and she could've killed Chamot and no one would have ever known\\n\r\nGoldov He seemed the most likely traitor but since he's in love with Nashetania he'd have motive to engage in villainy before a seventh brave appeared\\n\r\nNashetania No one questions her bunny ears and is already in a position to have two other braves willing to defend her. Then ends by adding ANOTHER seventh brave to ensure we get to play this game all over again.\\n\r\n[/spoiler]\\n\r\nRokka does have an interesting array of powers and abilities on display and Adlet is a genuinely likeable character and Flamie has some depth to her (though I hate her outfit) but everyone else is one dimensional, just like this story\\n",

            "content": "\u201cLegends say that when demons awaken from the depths of darkness, and turn the world into a living hell, the Goddess of Fate will select six heroes and give them the power to save the world.\r\nIt is always six that are chosen. And for this reason, they are known as the Braves of the Six Flowers.\u201d\r\nThe sentences above are introduction for every ep of Rokka no Yuusha series. As it states, the story follows several main characters as Yuusha or Heroes chosen by Goddess of Fate to save the world from fiend's resurrection nowadays. Adlet Mayer, this guy who seems like a masculine girl forthe first time (sadly it's a boy, so sad for me), got the seal of Yuusha in the back of her right hand. The seal on the body is the proof if someone really is the chosen hero from the legend. Then, these heroes gather fast to stop the fiend's resurrection from happening. In the meantime, they gather and tighten relationship to build teamwork and getting any plan in mind to work out later at the moment they fight, problem arises...there are seven persons got the Yuusha seal. So, what does it mean actually? and how they will stop the resurrection if among themselves have a crucial problem of mistrust by being the fake one? \\n\r\n[something spoiler] I wish that there's no romance such Adlet and Flamie is going on. I felt so weird watching scenes when Adlet told his feelings to Flamie. It would be better if Adlet keep it or rather adore Flamie by her willing to survive and be kind even if her harsh personality remains. However, I can't deny too, if I like Flamie when she is being more human at heart, and her smiling is drowning me so deep to her personality.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u200b    The opening made me think that it would be a rock out show with hard-to-deal opponent as the ending. It wasn\u2019t like that actually or I should say it wasn\u2019t reach that step within 12 eps. The studio gave no option for us but to follow the characters\u2019 mindblowing problem put in there. When you\u2019re accustomed to see the end of action, fantasy/supernatural story with a bombastic ending like nice strategies, a long wait til main characters show off their hidden abilities in a long time concealment, or even death of several characters (then exhale \u201cphew\u201d in an amusement)\u2014those are all still kept by the studio. The show attains my attention with its attempt to lead us differently from other common shows focusing on letting fire break out. For few eps, the Heroes are quarreling about the seventh/fake Hero\u2019s identity and to eliminate her/him. Worthless battles in such cruelty sometimes made me speechless with fury like \u2018why bother much wasting time with lame logic. Let\u2019s hit the hay and gimme something to amaze within 12 eps\u2019. However, I did never imagine that method to amaze me enough, I commence to plead for knowing the logic reason behind the catastrophe of fake Heroes. How does the seal manage to appear for seven persons? It isn't a painting or tattoo, right? What if the Goddess of Fate power is no longer pure and the fiend successfully interrupt its progress to pick Yuusha?\\n\\n\\n\r\n    Stay out patiently til the end of the show, for watching the arguments willy-nilly made me find out deeper about each characters. Focusing more for one to two characters, I could relate why it succeed to bring up the explanation more about other characters\u2019 storylife. We could get more knowledge about how the characters think and act according to their reasoning. But it wasn't good enough to amuse someone who has a need of battle tense or even be a disgusting show by much talk here as well as an impression from the visualization of Rokka no Yuusha series. It\u2019s nice enough and nothing to brag about thoroughly. I would wish it could be much better. I mark few scenes when Adlet nicely pictured using several tools as offense and defense method.\\n\\n\r\n    I think this show production was expensive after I realized it had many theme songs. For short series (12 eps) and few changes for both OP and ED songs, I guessed it was a waste. Basically, \"a waste\" by my opinion happens due to its lack of charm. These theme songs aren't satisfied enough, average and there's below average. I couldn't enjoy the music, I couldn't get the beat related to the tension of the show. It was sufficient to stay for background of the theme songs (scenes when theme song is playing on scene). Two OP songs are Cry for the Truth by MICHI, Black Swallowtail by UROBOROS. Then, three ED theme songs are Secret Sky by MICHI, Dance in the Fake by Nachetanya (Yoko Hikasa), and Nameless Heart by Fremy (Aoi Yuuki).\\n\\n\r\n\u200b\\n\r\nIt can be way livelier with battle scenes, I hope for more worthy battles if there will be 2nd season. It is good enough by unexpected story and how far logic is using here for now. I give 6 for rate.\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nDamn unexpected story and logic\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nWhat a waste of theme songs\\n\r\nLack of battle scenes to fight fiend. C'mon guys, your enemy is fiend. Why stuck for so long about the seventh. Find out faster by aws logic and make it out, the harsh battles!\\n",

            "content": "Story: 2/5\r\nAlright so Aztec themed story where six chosen ones are out to defeat the evil demon lord in twelve episodes. It should be fast paced and awesome.............WRONG! They spend half the series in one location blaming one another over and over as the seventh Brave. The theories are very stupid and it literally goes no where.\r\nArt: 3/5\r\nThe art is very appealing and the characters very well drawn. It is easily the best part about the series.\r\nCharacters: 3/5\r\nEach has their backstory but you only ever get to see the main character Adlets and told about Flamies. There is not a lot of build up intotheir backstories. No flash backs for any other character and nothing but constant infighting. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/5\\n\\n\r\nThe way the story was done just killed it. I started off enjoying it and found myself stupidly frustrated ten fold by the time the last episode played. It looked forced and the writing was jumbled and all over the place. It ruined the whole series. If they decide to continue it which I pray they won't I won't watch it because it wasn't even worth the wasted hours I put into it. I want my life back now. Please and thank you!",

            "content": "Some Spoilers (seventh not given away) \r\nI didn't finish Rokka - Braves of the six flowers- the season it aired. No, it was a long time after it that I finally finished, incredibly excited to finish a show I used to hype so much. But the show did not follow up on its beginning, rather it went downhill, rather quickly. Due in part to being a light novel adaptation that was squeezed into twelve episodes, the content that viewers expected to receive wasn't there. The whole battle with the demon king? Nonexistent. What seemed to be a couple of episodes stuck in a temple turnedout to be the entire series, which turned out to be quite boring. After the initial excitement of the battles and worry about Adlet, the episodes became somewhat predictable and followed the same pattern. Suspicion, fight, repeat. Really I would have even excused it if for the last episode they finally moved on, but until the last couple minutes they were stuck within the barrier. The relationship between Adlet and Flamie really caught me off guard since Adlet never expressed any real interest in her. All the sudden he loved her, and then they became the power duo. I think that they could have written their relationship to be well established with Adlet clearly showing to the audience that he liked Flamie. The production quality of the show went to shit, at some parts I even laughed. They set the bar high only to drop it towards the end, visuals of Adlet seem to scream parody anime that doesn't try to be good. Stills filled every shot of the scene, the detail no where to be found. As if those problems weren't enough, in the final episode in the final minutes they decide to introduce a new character. If that sounds ridiculous, you're right. There is no logical reason to introduce a character that late. In show that spent its whole air time finding the seventh, it ruins any gratification of knowing who was the outsider if you just say, \"one of them maybe the outsider still.\" The wrap up of the show was honestly disappointing, but I have to be honest the first couple of episodes was enjoyable. We were introduced to characters that were unique from each other and initially had good animation, there was a clear goal in sight and the path the show was taking was clear. Unfortunately the characters were not all shown off, many of them getting hardly any screen time, the animation went to shit, the goal was never met or even started really, and the show went off its rails taking its clear find the seventh and defeat the demon kind path to we really nothing since there is another seventh. Honestly I wish I could say it was good, but at best I can say it was average and even then I would be lying to myself. It was bad. It was disappointing. The second half really ruined any good parts he first half had.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, want a resolution to this series? Hah, funny. There is no continuation, so at the end of the shitty cliffhanger, you're left there forever. Have fun.",
