            "content": "This anime in 8 words: \u201cAnticlimactic Magical Girl Death Game With Wasted Potential \u201d \r\nYes, this is just another magical girl dark twist anime. Unfortunately, it's not that great of one either and here's why:\r\nThis is what a series looks like when it tries to have emotional shock factor, but fails because it's only 12 episodes long and has too many characters. When characters die, most of the times you won't even care because there are too many of them and you don't ever know their backstory until the episode of their death. This series has a damsel in distress, innocent, naive main protagonist. Thereare no moral messages to be gained from this anime and no overarching reasons for the events that happen. It\u2019s, simply put, excessive \u201cjust because\u201d death-game violence. However, I believe it's still worth watching if you like seeing violence and/or the death of magical girls. \\n\\n\r\nI want to note that I actually did enjoy watching the series for the most part, but this is from my unbiased perspective as a person who has seen a lot of anime. It will probably be a lot better to the people that haven't seen as many anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis being a thriller, you should go into series expecting there to be intense, edgy battles and deaths. Most of the characters could have been expanded upon, but weren't, and that largely took away from the potential of the series. I honestly believed that it started off with the potential to be outstanding, but it quickly went downhill once the death game began. The great characters started dying off too quickly without me building any attachment to them. The main protagonist \u201cSnow White\u201d was excessively naive and innocent throughout the whole anime. Consequently, I did not enjoy almost any time she got screentime after the first few episodes because every side-character was significantly more interesting than her.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10 \\n\r\nThe basic premise of the story is that ordinary people were selected to become magical girls while playing a magical girl phone game. They are then forced into a death game where the magical girl with the least amount of \"candies\" at the end of the week dies. They initially gained these candies by performing acts of goodness, but Fav (the Kyubey knockoff) continuously adds in new elements that push some of the magical girls to kill each other instead. This is definitely not a \"psychological\" series; you can tell as it presents itself in the cliche, archetypal, non-unique characters. Taking that into consideration, I feel that the writers tried, but failed, to portray powerful concepts like friendship, desperation, loss, and psychological twists. This is largely because they introduced these archetype characters with amazing potential, but then got rid of them just as fast. Unfortunately, the fast pacing and the anticlimactic ending left me with feelings of wasted potential as I finished.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was nothing outstanding, but pretty good. There wasn\u2019t anything particularly unique about it. I enjoyed the battle scenes and the fluidity of the animation. The characters were a bit too colorful and cute for me personally, but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. The brightness of the characters in combination with the dark background made the series feel less dark and more lighthearted. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10 \\n\r\nNon-unique, average, unmemorable ost. Although, the ending theme was relatively nice. Both the opening and the ending didn\u2019t really suit the anime. Music was a bit too lighthearted for what was happening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:4/10\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, most of the characters die soon after they\u2019re introduced. I liked most of them because of their diverse personalities, but I don't think you will be getting any new favorite characters out of this anime. If this anime was a real magical girl series with the same characters and similar deaths, I feel that it would have been significantly better. Most of the characters had great potential for development, but I could not form any attachments to any of them because of their short screen time and lack of backstories until the moment before their death. It was such a waste\u2026 *shakes head*\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6.5/10\\n\r\nAll things considered, it was alright. Never watching it again, but I don\u2019t regret watching it at all. The fighting and characters were enjoyable enough for me to continue watching it this season. I looked forward to seeing what would happen in each new episode, but the end of the series made me feel that it\u2019s just anticlimactic overall with nothing to be gained from the resolution (not even satisfaction). I would watch a season two to see where they go from here because it's still entertaining nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nI can't give this series any higher than a 7 because it wasn't really that good and no less than a 5 because it certainly wasn't below average overall.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: Would I recommend this to you? \\n\r\nIf all you want is the gore/killing, then absolutely. \\n\r\nIf you want a great story, then no it\u2019s just wasted potential. \\n\r\nIf you want both, then try Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero (anything but Ilya from the \"Fate/\" Series), Akame Ga Kill, or Mirai Nikki. \\n\r\nIf you want a similar concept that\u2019s better imo, then try Madoka Magica, Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha, or Btoom.\\n\\n\r\nHope this helps you make your decision! If so, let me know by clicking helpful! If not, let me know why you disagree~\\n",

            "content": "\u201cI kinda like it when a lotta people die.\u201d --George Carlin\r\nSometimes, all you need is kill. Ing. That\u2019s what I was looking for with Magipro. I was a little stressed, you see. I was in a weird spot at the beginning of the season: pets dying, mothers hospitalized, promotions at work, dads who live forty miles away and need rides to work another forty miles away. Oh my god. I have RESPONSIBILITIES?! \r\nTough times call for easy viewing. I wanted something that I didn\u2019t have to think about. Something fun. And the synopsis of Magipro fit the bill. Magical girls killing each other? Don\u2019t carewhy, I wanna see it. People dying is sensational and thrilling. Violence, murder, blood, death, despair! Sometimes, all we need is a little action. Fantasy is for the things we don\u2019t want to experience. It\u2019s all just for fun. Kill to thrill. It\u2019s no fun \u2018till someone dies.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s why\u2026 I was actually disappointed with Magipro when it started. They give an obvious implication that things will go very wrong for everyone on screen, but if it weren\u2019t for that small foreshadowing then this would\u2019ve been seen as nothing more than a mediocre mahou shoujo anime. It starts off with talking. Then more talking. Followed by more fucking talking. Then the main character gets a template-level transformation and runs around town helping strangers over some exposition and incredibly light music. Where\u2019s the charm? Where\u2019s the MAGIC? Being a magical girl sounds really fucking boring given this show\u2019s depiction of it. Madoka Magica was such a thrill because it had a really interesting depiction of magical girls until things got really fucked up. In Magipro, dying is the most interesting thing you could do.\\n\\n\r\nI need to pause for a moment to calmly explain to you, kind readers, that if you continue comparing a show that is nothing more than a bloodbath to a complete deconstruction of an entire genre, I will find you, rip your arms off, and recreate Sentarou\u2019s drum solo from the pilot of Kids on the Slope using your severed limbs as drumsticks. Please stop making this retarded comparison. The shows have nothing in common beyond being dark magical girl shows, and Magipro doesn\u2019t even hold a candle to Madoka\u2019s spectacle.\\n\\n\r\nNow, back to the review.\\n\\n\r\nSoon enough, the killings begin! ...In the form of really soft and boring deaths. Magipro is more of a competition in the beginning with the weakest link getting killed off. This is then revealed to the other girls by a couple people gathering info and sharing it around. They then complain by gathering in a chatroom and arguing with something that that is way too obviously a combination of Kyubey from Madoka and Monokuma from Danganronpa. Yawn. Where\u2019s the drama? Someone just fucking DIED for fuck\u2019s sake! Where\u2019s the intensity?! \\n\\n\r\nAlright, so eventually they start killing each other\u2026 it\u2019s kinda nice, but also\u2026 I dunno, tame? No single fight nor death stuck out to me. There\u2019s not much else to the show beyond magical girls killing each other, so you\u2019d think this would be played up much more. Nah, no one had a crushingly brutal death, it\u2019s more like they just lost in a fight and death was more of a side effect. I\u2019d recommend seeing your doctor if you get a side effect of death, though. But there IS a lot of blood. Blood is fun, so the more there is, the better. One scene had multiple characters die in the same place, with blood splashing over some other characters. I jerked off to it. It was art.\\n\\n\r\nOne good thing about all the deaths is that they come at a pretty alarming rate. Perhaps it\u2019s for the anime\u2019s benefit that few people die in the early episodes, because that means multiple deaths in each episode later on. That\u2019s when things get fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe way things play out can be interesting. Magical girls form pairs or teams, leading to tag-team fights and surprising betrayals. The drama is surprisingly decent, but it\u2019s not too hard to throw in a bunch of crazy shit happening with a cast of sixteen characters. But still, it was nice to see certain bitches get double-crossed and some deaths can be unexpected. Except for\u2026 you know, the ones that happen about five minutes after someone\u2019s backstory is revealed. Death flags are thrown around a lot, and that\u2019s no fun. It\u2019s like hearing what you\u2019re gonna get for Christmas. I can\u2019t be surprised about getting a PS4 and now Christmas sucks. Thanks, Trump.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren\u2019t that good since they\u2019re all meant to die anyway, but I still found myself rather amused by most of them. Many of them have their own idea of what it means to be a magical girl, and their access to power twists their mind a little. Say what you want about how bitchy Ruler is, she was one of the strongest characters. But none can compare to best girl TOPU SPEEDO. She wears a big witch hat and rides a broom. Everyone else go home. Anyway, the characters are just adequate--when the backstories are timed well, they\u2019re actually pretty satisfying. Seeing a person\u2019s life before their transformation and how much they\u2019ve changed was interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, NONE of the above can be said about the main character, Snow White. She is an utterly atrocious character. There might as well have not been a lead, because she literally does jack shit besides cry, get upset, cry, lament about people dying, cry, and complain about her definition of being a magical girl not getting across to anyone else. Tough luck, bitch, go fucking murder people. I need to watch things die at a good safe distance, and you\u2019re not helping. Why is she here? Can her parents please pick her up? \\n\r\nI mean, it\u2019s cool that she\u2019s the innocent character who cries about death all the time, but the fact that she isn\u2019t even around for 80% of the time means she probably gets less screentime than several other people. Kinda hard to consider her the lead at this point. If she were at least part of the action and tried interfering with people every now and then, I could get behind her involvement, but I\u2019m not joking when I say that she did nothing in the entire season. She makes Yukiteru Amano look like Yuno Gasai.\\n\\n\r\nTheir designs are pretty great for the most part and have a lot of detail and personality to them, but uh\u2026 what\u2019s with all the fanservice? No, I\u2019m not about to go \u201cWAHHHH! THERE\u2019S CLEAVAGE IN MY ANIME, MAKE IT STOP!!! WAAAAAAHHHH!!\u201d It\u2019s just weird when half the girls have big tits and wear super revealing and tight-fitting outfits to compliment their big tits, and the other half are practically flat and wear more creative and cutesy outfits. I don\u2019t mind fanservice as a whole, and some sexuality is always expected, but goddamn, Magipro. Why don't you just dispense paper towels at the start of every episode? Top Speed still the hottest though. Get a witch hat, idiots.\\n\\n\r\nBut the best thing, of all things\u2026 are the names. Goddamn do these characters have beautiful names. Ripple. Calamity Mary. Winterprison. Hardgore Alice. Izetta the Last Witch. Holy fuck these are edgy. That\u2019s so cool. I love them so much. I like edgy things because I like having fun every once in a while and don\u2019t need to look mature by putting down teenage angst. I embrace it when it doesn\u2019t go too far because it\u2019s fun. Magipro is fun. It can afford to be a little edgier, though.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Magipro had some good moments. It ultimately delivered on its promise--a bunch of cute girls dying. It did what it was asked to, but didn\u2019t exceed expectations nor disappoint. It was just a perfectly adequate job. Watching it was tiring at first, but I found myself having fun after a few slow episodes. In the end, that\u2019s what matters, even if it could\u2019ve been better. I recommend it for that, but I\u2019m sure there are much better battle royales out there. Hell, I would actually say that Mirai Nikki is unironically better. Might need to put a trigger warning somewhere, though.\\n\r\nI gave it a 5 because that\u2019s average. It\u2019s not a low score, it\u2019s the midpoint between 1 and 10. Don\u2019t blame me for having \u201clow scores\u201d if you think 7.7 is \u201caverage\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nOh, I guess I forgot the art and sound sections. Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yep they exist. Alright, got that taken care of.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nArt - 5/10\\n\r\nSound - 5/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5/10\\n\r\nTop Speed  - 55/10\\n\r\nOverall - 5.5/10\\n\r\nFavorite character - PM me Top Speed hentai\\n\r\nFavorite episode - not 9 that\u2019s for fucking sure\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku,  yet another entry for the \"dark and edgy\" as well as unnecessarily sophisticated \"mature\" magical girl genre.\r\nThe Magical Girl Raising Project took a creative risk to introduce the completely original and unique concept (*major sarcasm) of the dark side of Mahou Shoujo\u2018s to audiences. Plot: Girl(s) with ``surprise surprise\u2019\u2019 problems in the real world distract themselves from their problems by playing a free to play (*with micro transactions) magical girl game on their android or IOS devices. But! Get this, in the game The Magical Girl Raising Project, one in tens of thousands of people to get to be areal \"magical girl\u201d even guys apparently... that\u2019s a spoiler for another day.  Besides the unwanted shock at the beginning of the series, the plot of the story was for the magical girls\u2019 to race each other and collect more \"magical candies\" than their competitors. You know, a sweet and fun game that young girls would probably play\u2026 maxing out their parent\u2019s credit cards on the micro transaction, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this changed however, and the edginess kicked in. Instead of working together to defeat the common evil, the girls instead start killing each other because that is the easiest and most logical solution to solving problems.\\n\r\nThe edginess and darkness that the story adds for shock value is simply repulsive. There was too much effort made to try and set this title apart from similar mahou shoujo titles with unique rules stipulations. Often time given out by some sort of creature or deity. I felt that the entire story was supposed to be going for \u201cuniqueness\u201d and there is no doubt that the staff reached their goal however, somewhere along the lines the staff got too involved in trying to recreate the same ``dark & edgy\u2019\u2019 formula seen in titles like Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, and Mahou Shoujo Madoka. So to a certain extent it just feels like watching a knock-off version of YuYu or Madoka.\\n\\n\r\nThis approach took away a lot of the good parts and redeeming qualities that the story had to offer. Rather than focusing on a story that branches out more on the game and characters, you\u2019re greeted to a blood fest rumble where the main focus leans on shock value and a darker narrative. The story feels too constricted as well as repetitive with it's choices in storytelling. The most noticeable patterns are plot twist, shocking moments, and of course blood and gore. There are lighter times however; they are kept to a minimal. Only to be used when they need to add a quick plot twist. Because of the lack of freedom in the story, I found it difficult to remain engaged and satisfied with the events taking place in the story.  \\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is impressive nonetheless! Lerche is a pretty reputable studio putting out hit titles like Assassination classroom, Danganronpa, School-Live (*maybe not so much) and of course Monster Musume. All shows with amazing visuals and special effects. I found myself most intrigued by the battles in rising project, which should be no surprise. The destruction of scenery coupled with the determination and fear on most girls\u2019 faces while fighting were well displayed. I felt like the visual tension between the characters made most fight scenes feel more dramatic too.The best fights where the animation felt clean and fluent had involved Calamity Mary and Cranberry. So I would highly recommend watching them in action. I mean you know a battle is done right when you want to go back and re-watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fits the atmosphere of the battles. The well composed songs create a good amount of tension and exciting during events throughout the anime. While I felt the soundtrack was good, I did feel like it lacked the replay value and lasting effect that puella magi madoka magica soundtrack had. That aside, the voice actors were pretty good. I felt like each actor did an amazing job representing their perspective characters and giving them personality\u2026 except that dog girl whose name I cannot remember, and I\u2019m too lazy to go close out of word and Google it. I\u2019ll probably edit this out\u2026 or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of the series would have to be the fighting.  I would\u2019ve said drama however, Magical girl rising project is the kind of show where the drama tends to drag on. It goes on to the point where you\u2019ll probably lose interest and skip forward a little. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the show isn\u2019t \u201cbad\u201d as in \u201cthe worst thing ever.\u201d It\u2019s just full of too many clich\u00e9\u2019s and predictable moments depending on how experienced you are when it comes to watching anime. If there were any changes that needed to be made for the shows second season, if green lit. I would hope that they use an approach that isn\u2019t so\u2026 one-sided. I want to see more than just violence and drama. I would like to see more into the characters daily lives and happier moments that last longer than 6 minutes (in screen-time.)\\n\\n\r\nI gave Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku a 7/10 because I felt like despite all of the problems the show presents, it still manages to captivate audiences with its intense fights, drama, and unique cast of characters. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku - One more \"Mahou Shoujo\" to the collection\r\nI realize there are \"mahou\" animes but I do not understand why they have to be so bad. \r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is an example of how a \"magical\" anime manages to be tragic.\r\nThe synopsis tells us that there is a social game called \"The Magical Girl Raising Project\" that allows one of them to be chosen to be a \"magic girl\" within a group of people (hence the tone \"mahou\" of the whole anime), which means she will have extraordinary physical abilities as well as magical powers that differentiate from the rest fromthe humans. What happens next is that, in a district where there are 16 girls, the administration thinks it should reduce the number of \"magic girls\" where each one should consume some \"magic candies\" but something becomes twisted and then the anime turns out into a giant plotwist for survival.\\n\\n\r\nSince the concepts of \"mahou\" animation from Cardcaptor Sakura to Madoka Magica, mahou anime were always in a fan idea, yet it is not exactly a genre that can be enjoyed to the fullest because it is not generally interesting, so it is normal to people ignore it. Unlike other anime of the same genre, Ikusei Keikaru is everything but original, this series lives basically and during the episodes, the typical clich\u00e9. It's pretty clear that every character who has (or counts or shows) a backstory is pretty much a victim of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn a certain part of the story, the writers should have decided that the anime alone was not edgy enough, unless the characters passed on their way of life as a form of currency. It's a little hard to understand, but let's just say it's like stepping on legos, it hurts but then it's okay. In terms of art, the anime is horribly bad, not as bad as Dangaronpa for example but it is down the middle. The design of the characters is a disaster and honestly it was the part that I really didn't liked in the series. When I say that art is bad, I am also talking about the characters.The anime starts from the first episode to be defined with the tag good vs bad so it is possibly what \"feeds\" the series. In fact, no character is able to \"save\" the series because in general, the characters are very limited.\\n\\n\r\nAn \"mahou\" anime can not have more than four characters as main characters and even then four is already a lot, the ideal is really three for each fight or a goal and better the anime mahou, in general.Now, the problem resides in the Rest of the characters, this rest is all those that appear in two or three episodes and die without having their moment of the series. The more the part of the series that has each person has an arc, half of the episodes neither serves for nothing by that person is dies and is dies, all was in vain.\\n\\n\r\nI had this anime in my plan to watch because I was missing the animes that came through in the old days and that I came to see more recently, but I was not expecting anything like this. This anime is super annoying and I advise no one to see it, unless you are a person that is an undisputed hardcore fan who thinks that all animes are really good but still (Mahou Shoujo) Ikusei Keikaru proves that no.",

            "content": "Ohhh not another dark reconstruction of the magical girl genre...yes, but it's also it's own thing at the same time.\r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku has a social game of becoming magical girls turned battle royale and sure on the surface it looks like a Puella Madoka Magica ripoff just under a \"social game setting\", but as much as Puella Madoka Magica comes at you with it's dark themes so suddenly without warning, Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku goes for the more slower approach and giving us some VERY well done anti-villains along the way.\r\nIn terms of characters, it is one of greatest strengths towards the entire \"BattleRoyale but under the social game schema\", but it has it's ups and downs concerning if it's towards the more level-headed peaceful characters or the more psychotic ones. If it's towards the peaceful characters, LA gets it that some want to keep to the \"rules\" of the game, but it leads to be too naive of the plot at hand and the more obvious being having an easy target on you, the easiest towards this goes to Sister Nana voiced by Saori Hayami, Snow White voiced by Nao Touyama (especially at the start) and Top Speed voiced by Yumi Uchiyama. On the other spectrum, the more psychotic characters actually makes the anime's plot move forward and alot more interesting what with their character backstory as to how they became magical girl and for what reasoning, as much as this statement kinda of sounds like what Fav voiced by Kurumi Mamiya, the mascot of the Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku (and obvious Kyubey stand-in), but in terms of plot and interest, the anime wouldn't been this interesting enough, anyways the more psychotic characters that fit this bill going to Cranberry voiced by Megumi Ogata, Calamity Mary voiced by Kikuko Inoue and Swim Swim voiced by Inori Minase (halfway through anyways)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters do bring up themes of morality especially from Top Speed, it even brings themes of gender disparity especially from La Pucelle voiced by Ayane Sakura (slight spoilers...but La Pucelle is Snow White's male childhood friend...no LA didn't do a typo, anyways since La Pucelle's interest to magical girls at an early age and was humiliated by his friends, it kinda reflects the ACTUAL audience especially those in the male demographic who watches it..LA doesn't know if it's meant to be a jab at the audience or it's being self-aware that the audience are mainly males and maybe due to the atmosphere of the anime, it makes sense)\\n\\n\r\nThe plot twists really comes in the form of the characters true identities/backstories and how their deaths comes be in the end, some do get a short backstory after their deaths, some goes more into greater detail in order to motivate the other magical girls. What the only flaw to some of the death plot twists comes in form of the backstory coming in as a hint to who's gonna die next (not always but it comes up as a major predictability). Nonetheless the plot twists varies in how it's executed. LA also thinks that because of this, it's less Puella Madoka Magica and the more referenced in this review, Battle Royale. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as deaths are concerned however, LA will say at the very least that due to the major \"villains\" presented and given backstory on, they at the very least helps makes the entire \"Battle Royale\" schema along with the interesting villains propel the plot and makes it all the more interesting what some of the more unhinged and utterly psychotic villains there are, don't forget the magical girls' morals getting put into question along with their social mobile game turn into \"survival\"...and quite later on \"slaughter\".\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by Lerche, it had quite the crisp animation especially concerning the character designs and battle animation and the more brutalized deaths (seemed Lerche is going Danganronpa levels of animation detail). The animation at best was consistent for the majority of the animation, though LA rarely in the later episodes saw the animation dip slightly but not to the point LA wouldn't have distracted LA. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms voice acting, the majority of the voice cast did exceptional, with some standouts going to Kikuko Inoue, Inori Minase and Manami Numakura who voiced by Ripple. As much LA wanted Nao Touyama to be LA's favourite in this section, she did at best, her typical genki girl archetype though towards the end of the anime she showed a bit more, no LA's favourite voice actors would go to Kikuko Inoue and Kurumi Mamiya who voiced Fav.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was at best, showing Fav's true colors and at the same time, it was solely a satisfying ending, though the \"final battle\" felt slightly anti-climaxed, nonetheless, it made sure the anime ENDED without any hint of a second season, it concluded the anime quite nicely with all thing considered even with it's slight anti-climax. \\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku maybe seen as another ripoff of the dark magical girls trying to STILL ride on the coat-tails of the Puella Madoka Magica, but for all LA can see, it's definitely trying to be it's own thing and sure the allusions of Madoka are there (Snow White's pink hair, her indecisiveness, the dark themes, a mascot character with ulterior motives etc.), but as LA said at the start of this anime review, it's definitely trying to be it's own thing under a Battle Royale setting with interesting villains and peaceful characters that quite frankly should have been another genre but nonetheless their contrasting personalities towards the social game and it's rules and even better the plot twists to finding out Fav has lied to them raises it as an interesting development. Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku may have it's issues and weakness but they are weighed in favour of it's strong focus, it's themes, questionable villains and indecisive heroes and Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku to be it's own thing.",

            "content": "In recent years there has been the rise of a sub-genre of anime I\u2019d like to call \u2018moe flip\u2019. In this sub-genre, cute characters are immersed in harsh conditions, often brutal, that are unlike what the characters represent by their looks alone. These shows engage the audience through their shock value; having cute characters commit brutal actions or transform into psychological monsters. The masterpieces in this sub-genre go beyond the shock value and deliver compelling characters.\r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is a \u2018moe-flip\u2019 show that excels in delivering great shock value but fails to present meaningful characters.\r\n[Magical girl battle royale]\r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku, or Magical GirlsRaising Project (MGRP for short), is a fantasy thriller adapted from a light novel of the same title by the studio Lerche who\u2019ve also created other \u2018moe-flip\u2019 shows as Gakkougurashi. The story revolves around magical girls (mahou shoujo) who are forced to fight each other for their survival. Himekawa Koyuki, also known as the magical girl Snow White, is thrust into a role so different from what\u2019s she\u2019s dreamed of and tries to stick to her ideals. This task becomes increasingly difficult as the high stakes slowly reveal the monsters that have hidden in the midst of the magical girls.\\n\\n\r\n[Lukewarm reception]\\n\r\nMGRP initially received a lukewarm reception when it began airing on the 2nd of October, 2016. People who\u2019d gotten wary of the abundance of \u2018moe\u2019 anime were turned off by the character designs, calling it another \u2018moe\u2019 show. It\u2019s magical girls theme didn\u2019t help either - but its shock value did. With the first flip, the first death of a magical girl, the interest waxed. And when the show revealed its most influential character, it gained a steady following. This interest was maintained by the shows consistency in delivering shocking events albeit with the absence of a good plot.\\n\\n\r\n[A thin plot]\\n\r\nThe entire plot - or most of it - of MGRP is told in the first two episodes of the show. As with most \u2018moe-flip\u2019 shows, the pacing is not slow; the \u2018flip\u2019 often happens early. The first episode introduces the two main characters, the Magical Girl Rising Project which is actually a mobile game, as well as a few supporting characters. The second episode introduces the major conflict of the show through the death of one of the magical girls. Afterwards, the show became a series of battles with the occasional backstory employed for emotional impact. Unfortunately, this was ineffective as there was too little time to get invested in the characters; a lot of the characters died too quickly. MGRP was a victim of its large cast but there were a few standout characters that drove the story.\\n\\n\r\n[Diverse characters but not much development]\\n\r\nKoyuki is the designated main character, as identified at the beginning of the show and has a few recognizable traits that define her. She\u2019s pure-hearted, diligent and passionate about being a magical girl. As a result, she\u2019s the least prepared for the changes that occur after the game\u2019s mascot, Fav, announces that it\u2019d need to cut down the number of magical girls. She grows during the course of the series, becoming bold enough to choose to rescue people at the risk of being attacked and killed by another magical girl. But at different points in the first few episodes she often has more battle-hardened and mentally strong characters come to her aid. One of those characters is Sazanami Kano, also know as the magical girl Ripple.\\n\\n\r\nKano is one of the few characters in the show that\u2019s well-developed; there are many scenes of Kano outside her magical girl persona unlike most of the cast. She\u2019s introduced as indifferent to the system and the other magical girls but becomes more involved after a traumatic event. She\u2019s stronger than Koyuki psychologically and isn\u2019t afraid to battle with the other magical girls. But Koyuki and Kano are not the most influential characters in the show; that title goes to Sakayagi Ayana, also known as the magical girl Swim Swim.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s difficult to state how compelling Ayana is without spoiling parts of the show. She\u2019s a product of the new system created and uses it to her advantage.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike other magical girl shows that feature high school girls, MGRP has a vast array of characters. There are high school girls, a girl in middle school, an office lady, female college students, a lesbian couple and even a boy. This diverse cast is further augmented by their diverse skills and brilliant character design.\\n\\n\r\n[Great character design with a glum mood]\\n\r\nEach of the magical girls has a unique design that reflects their ability. In fact, all but one of the designs for the characters and their skills were picked by the girls (and boy) themselves. For example, Ruler looks like a princess complete with a cape and sceptre and her ability is to force anyone in front of her to obey her commands. Tama\u2019s ability lets her dig 1m wide holes in any surface and she looks like a dog. The character design is made more remarkable by the art style and the overall mood.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the character art and art within the game is done in a cute style, the background art is not. The backgrounds are mostly done in washed out colours and most of the scenes are at night. This gloomy mood is complemented by the often sober music.\\n\\n\r\n[Fitting music but immemorable scores]\\n\r\nA good aspect of MGRP\u2019s music is that there\u2019s almost no cheery tunes; the tracks always seemed to propel the ominous mood of the show. Unfortunately, they seemed generic; one of the tracks even sounded like it was from a retro video game.\\n\\n\r\nMGRP was enjoyable for its take on the magical girl sub-genre and its shock value. It\u2019s diverse cast made it easier to connect to its characters. A fan of brutal thrillers would find this worth watching.",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is a Hunger Game-esque anime at its core that attempts to bring in an array of \"characters\" with varying magical talents in an attempt to show an edgier side of the Magical Girl genre. Through a mobile app game, girls are chosen by the magical entity Fav for unknown reasons, but they accidentally selected too many girls to become magical girls, and so now they all need to compete in a competition of either gaining the most candies or killing each other (someone will die by the end of the week regardless) in order for them to survive.\r\n-------------------------\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nStory-wise, Ikusei Keikakuis filled to the brim with nothing but terrible cliches. It became clear that any character whose backstory was shown was very likely to be among the victims of that episode, and if that wasn't enough, they made sure to try to employ every type of sympathy-tool for the casual audience as they possibly could.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter death not sad enough? Oh, well, they were pregnant. Also a housewife. Or they helped the homeless. Maybe they were bullied in school. They had found love. Their friend witnessed their death. Or maybe all of the above because this anime really has no dignity in its story. Death means nothing in this show, but I will explore that later on.\\n\\n\r\nAt some point in the series, the writers must have decided that the show just wasn't edgy enough unless the characters spent their life force (measured in years of their life) as a form of currency. I don't particularly count this as a spoiler because it hardly has any actual relevancy in the anime. It's just that they needed something to increase the variety of action in the show, so they added new items and they needed to make it \"dark\" for their teenage audience who thinks they're dark lords, so they made them use 'years of their life' as currency.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nAt first it doesn't really look bad to me, but the more I look at it, the more I'm slightly repulsed by it. I mean, the combat is kind of okay, but the proportions on the characters are pretty bad and the designs themselves are fairly unimaginative. The combat scenes can be alright, they're nothing special or worth noting, but they at least can have a moment of something at least looking decent.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nProbably the best part about the show is its sound. Not even so much the music, which relies on a set few soundtracks to play on repeat through every single episode. It's mostly the magical sound effects that give life to the series. If not for those, this anime likely wouldn't be heralded by much of anyone. My rating for this might actually be more of a case of, \"It's good by comparison to everything else\" rather than it being good as a standalone entity, but I'll stick by my rating of its sound quality for now.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nFor the most part, the characters in Ikusei Keikaku are defined by their abilities and where they fall on the good vs. evil spectrum, with barely anyone at all falling in the middle. Either they're hardcore good or hardcore evil. Even characters that are super evil and have been killing off characters for the duration of the series are given backgrounds that try to \"redeem\" them and try to make the audience have sympathy for them, which really shouldn't work for anyone who isn't just watching for mindless entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters will either be \"I will defend the ones I love!\" or \"I will protect myself by killing those who stand in my way.\" This is pretty much the case for absolutely everyone with maybe one or two exceptions.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime falls drastically to the curse of having too many characters. That might not always be a problem, there are plenty of anime out there that have a wide cast array but still manage to make them feel like more than plot devices. For Ikusei Keikaku, it's more that each character is a cameo appearance until they have their own arc. How do you know its their arc? The episode will introduce their backstory and say \"hey, maybe there's an actual character here\" moments before killing the character off and stopping any hope of feeling any legitimate attachment to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you feel anything for the characters, I feel like I can definitively say you don't actually like the characters, you just like the atmosphere and the fact that the anime is forcefully telling you to care for them. It's not a natural \"I care for these characters because they're good,\" it's a \"I feel obligated to like this character in order to enjoy the series.\"\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nI originally saw this anime and was really anticipating it probably more than anything else in the season. And as it started, I detracted on that position almost immediately. After the exhaustively obvious formula of who is going to die next was figured out, it wasn't really worth caring for any of the characters. Not in that it was a defense mechanism for me not to care, but because the anime didn't give me a reason to care. The anime just kills characters and hopes that you're sad at the concept of meaningless death as long as they toss in some crying friend or sappy flashbacks at the moment of death.\\n\\n\r\nThe most enjoyment I got out of it was laughing at how abrupt or sudden a death was. There's no actual reason to care for any of the characters because they never provided a reason to care, so attachment was out the window from the get-go. It was hard for me to look at this anime and even see the worldbuilding aspect of it because you can just see that the writer just wanted to showcase magical fights in a \"dark setting where hope is hard to find.\"\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is desperate for reaction. It tries everything it can to force reactions from the audience rather than letting the audience feel things by themselves, and in doing so, comes across as petty and undignified. It's nothing more than a disappointing cash-grab that has nothing to offer anyone in any form.",

Then I decided on a whim to choose this, and I don't regret it at all. There are two main reasons:\r\nThe first reason is.. a lot of types of mahou shoujos!yes, each with different ability. I thought that it would be interesting to see them battle each others. And it is executed very well I say. The battle scenes are not much, but they are pretty good. Sometimes they are not fight heads on buttrick each others, which is interesting to watch too.\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason is.. there are some plot twists in this anime. No, I'm not talking about how they'll die here. Anyone who see this anime will be able to conclude, which one will be dead next time after watching few episode, because the pattern is repeated. But there are some minor twists in the story that are unexpected, which make this show enjoyable to watch until the end. I bet you'll not be able to tell which one that will survive until the end, because some of them are not really stand out at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThere are another good things from this show, like the OP and ED. especially ED which is really suit the mood. some interesting psychological story telling, although not too deep. That is understandable considering the length of this anime is only 12 episode, and with so many characters too. Good thing that there are almost no useless fan service here. \\n\\n\r\nSo my final verdict is, you can enjoy this anime as simple fantasy action anime, don't expect too much on psychological aspect (go for madoka or even wixoss series for that). also, beware that there are gore and bloody scenes here, I think that's not for everyone to enjoy.",

            "content": "Few reviewers will be able to express eloquently the trainwreck that is this series. In nearly 12 eps, Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku turned a unconvoluted premise convoluted, obtuse, unfocused, and just outright weird.\r\nThe entire core of Magical Girl Raising Project was inspired from Puella Magi Madoka Magica, a critically acclaimed gem from 2011 that received praise for subverting the magical girl genre. It really blows that one of the few if only merits of the series is inspired from another, arguably better series made several years ago. \r\nThe main content of Magical Girl Raising Project is watching Magical Girls perform brutal violence. The first fourepisodes had great pacing, shocking twist, and established the characters. Then it proceeded to drop the ball on every single plot point. Character motivations cease to make sense, the lack of logic becomes hard to ignore, and the one track mind homicidal maniacs ruin any sense of attachment that I had towards the series.\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga, another obtuse, but surprisingly good, anime shares some commonalities. They both have very brief cutscenes interjected clumsily episode after episode to provide backstories for the characters, and both shows are unintentionally funny at moments. While Mayoiga was bad, there were redeeming qualities. Magical Girl Raising Project is a trainwreck and not an entertaining one. Crucial characters will disappear for episodes\\n\r\non end and plot points that you think would have been resolved in prior episodes pop back up for seemingly no reason.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just to beat a dead horse. At the very least I could say that this show delivered something worthwhile thematically. Nope! not at all. Approach this show with caution because it is patience testing and a complete mess.",

            "content": "So, this series attempted to do something unique with the magical girl genre; turn it into a real battle royal.  However, in it's attempt to do that, it completely gutted itself and ruined any potential it had.\r\nI'll start with the good things.  The character designs were somewhat unique.  Despite feeling like some of the characters were blatant rip-offs of a certain other magical girl series, there were also several that had super unique abilities and how they used them were well designed.  Especially Swimswim, I liked her ability... even if at times it felt like they didn't quite stick to itfully.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for the series was also above par.  I wouldn't say it was anything groundbreaking or specifically a reason why you should watch it, though.  The voice acting was also pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was... bearable.  For what it was worth, I didn't want to drop it expressly at any point, but that's probably because I quickly realized it wasn't going to have any potential and instead just let myself be pulled along for the ride.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that's about where the good points end.\\n\\n\r\nFor detractors, where do I start? How about the fact that they started with by far too many characters.  16?  Really?  Is that necessary?  If you need to end up chopping half of them out (or more), how are you going to give them any type of proper character development? You have 12 episodes, 16 characters... that's not even an episode worth of mild character development per character...\\n\\n\r\nDue to this, none of the characters get any solid character development.  Not even our \"main heroine\" who, tbh, isn't that main.  With the lack of development, this leaves you without any type of character connection or  relatability, so you have no reason to emphasize with the characters as they hit the chopping block.  On top of that, with the speed they do it, and lack of any backstory before they lose, you never get to the point of really wanting one to last till the end.  Yeah, they kind of steer you towards a few you don't want to see win, but you're more wanting to see them lose than care about others winning.\\n\\n\r\nSo remember how I said they don't get any real development before they lose?  That's the kicker, when they do lose, THAT is when they get a very small semblance of trying to build a backstory. Talk about bad story telling.  The writer obviously doesn't know wtf they're doing. Yes, attempt to give me a reason (poorly told ones at that) to like the character after they've ALREADY LOST!  What's the point in doing it now?\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing they tried to do, but didn't do too well at, was emphasize the shock factor. You could tell what happens to characters when they lose long before they \"revealed\" it. You also knew what the purpose of the whole thing was.  I mean, look at the title... (I might have used rearing instead of raising, personally, though).  There was no surprise.  The only surprising event was how early they removed the one chance they had of trying to make the viewer empathize with the main heroine (hint: EP6).\\n\\n\r\nNext, the shrinking of the number of \"winners\" they could have through out the series was horribly done.  There was little planning, little lead up, and no reasoning (other than our obvious end result reason) given. \"Oh, we just need to reduce the number\" is not a well written reason.  Come on, even I could give a more convincing reason than that and write it in a way that it didn't feel shoehorned in just as a story driver.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the one orchestrating all this, Fav, was a shitty antagonist, and another example of the author not knowing how to write a good story. It's importance entirely revolved around nothing more than to prod the girls.  It wasn't trying to stick to some moral high ground, or be actually evil... it couldn't commit to anything.  Too many times did it prod or give information it shouldn't have, only to then say that it's just a observer and shouldn't be influencing the events.\\n\\n\r\nFurther, the rabbits foot usage.  So, this for me was the crucifix that marked the series as poorly written and even more terribly executed.  There is a more appropriate, more emotional scene (for the MC that is, not for us) for it to have come into play than when it did (hint: EP10).  That is when this should have kicked in, considering it was there and there were far more emotions flying around from our MC.  But poor writing struck again, and it only ended up being used as a shallow (and poorly executed) plot driver.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all the story telling was pretty bad, to be honest.  So many things were written out of order, there was no character development, no shock & awe, no getting the viewer to feel invested in the characters or the story... and there was no satisfying ending. They never gave an any purpose as to why they were trying to \"raise them\". All they said was to find the strongest... but for what?  Why?  What good would it do for them? But I would say there was one good aspect to the story, and that was what I'll call the underdog factor when it came to which characters lasted the longest and earned the most... uh... wins.\\n\\n\r\nThe last detractor that I'll cover was, and this may be due to my personal like of the series, but how much it felt like it stole some of it's items from Madoka Magica.  Our \"main heroine\" feels very much like Madoka, who doesn't honestly do that much through out the series, and is instead attempted to be further driven into depression to have her be there at the end to make some final event happen.  Calamity Mary is, well, a partial rip-off of Mami.  Her fighting style and abilities are fairly similar and they both have unstable personalities. And then there's the Homura copy, who I won't say who she reminds me of (as that's spoiler I feel), but the character is your reclusive, kind of dark feeling, black hair, I'll do things my own way type of character.  Only thing missing is the backstory between the two (but again, this series doesn't have any of that anyway).  On top of that, we have a poor Kyubey rip off, Fav.  He's has a similar but different white design, is \"misunderstood\" (sort of), is alien to the story's world, and is there for some \"greater good\".  Come on... if you're going to try this, at least make the core set of characters look different!\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nSo all in all, the series is decent if all you want is a battle royal with magical girls, but if you're looking for anything beyond that, you're in for a massive disappointment, and I'll tell you you're better off looking other series (may I suggest Mirai Nikki or Akame ga Kill).",

            "content": "Hello, I am here to deliver a review for Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku. I just watched episode twelve tonight.\r\nI am not that into \"magical girl\" anime, so I won't be very bias in my review.\r\n\u30e1 Story: The story is very good. I am judging the story on it's plot twists and fear factor. The first three episode are delivered as the entire anime was meant to continue to be calm, but friendship is fickle in this one. There is a lot of intensely edgy backstories and death that make this anime even more edgy. It's sad at points if you get easily attached to characterslike I do, otherwise you'll think it's a \"over-the-top edge-fest\".  \\n\\n\r\n\u30e1 Art:  The art of the anime was very good in terms of movement and shading. The style in some frames could have awkward movement at some times. The art style is different. It's cute like you would expect a magical girl anime to be, but the direction and the fact many scenes take place at night make it \"dark\". Hell, \"Nanbaka\" has more sparkles than this!\\n\\n\r\n\u30e1 Sound: The sound is very good. I always judge sound on how memorable it is. During the sad moments, there is this piano piece that plays and I can't forget it. The ending is good as well. It's like a cool-down song similar to Death Parade's ending theme. The opening is nice, but I wish they did alternate versions of the opening as more characters died or as the plot progressed (ex. Dangan Ronpa 3: Hope Arc).\\n\\n\r\n\u30e1 Characters: I think the characters are good. I am glad the characters are not all in a similar age range. Most of the characters have an edgy backstory and diverse living standards. To be honest, their are still common character tropes for some characters (but they are hard to avoid).\\n\\n\r\n\u30e1 Enjoyment: I enjoyed this anime. It's something I have never watched before (as I have avoided Madoka Magica). Snow White is a wimpy main character, and her uselessness can be annoying sometimes. Even so, if it weren't for that I am not sure if she would have \"changed\" at the end.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, if you enjoy having your heart ripped out, blood/gore, no friendship power and dark stories...this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nThank you.\\n\\n\r\n- PlumAppleJuice\\n\\n",

            "content": "The battle royale theme is no stranger to the anime medium, with many series incorporating it in their storyline from Mirai Nikki to the Fate Series just to name a few. The method of execution is what usually enamours the audience, which is a quintessential requirement for its overall success. Now can be it done with magical girls? The answer is a yes but the degree to which it is provides an entertaining storyline is variable. Anyone who is well versed with a last man standing format should have a complete grasp of the problems associated with it.\r\nThe conspicuous social experiment that enables a totalof 16 magical girls battling each other to the death sounds amusing at first. The chosen participants are selected on a purely random scale each with their fair share of problems to boot. It looked rosy at first with the magical girls conversing with each other in the common chat room, only to take a sinister turn moments later. The news of the passing of the friendliest magical girl instilled fear and worry which was only going to get worse from this point. A battle royale truly begins when the first participant dies and Nemurin was the catalyst for the violence and destruction that soon follows.\\n\\n\r\nThe rules for the social experiment need to be addressed as I find it to be a major concern of mine. The objective in the magical girl raising project is to avoid getting the least amount of magical candies which are obtained through honest good deeds that signifies one being a Samaritan. The reward for aiding the vulnerable populace is clear but to me becomes irrelevant for the magical girls. Why waste your time when you can simply kill other magical girls to fulfil the requirements of the game? This quota in place holds no significance for the murderers who have no qualms about ending another\u2019s life which include the public. It\u2019s either dying by having no magical candies or being murdered by another magical girl. This is such an ideal scenario for a devout pacifist\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe game-master who oversees the pandemonium Fav is a pure mystery at this point. This fluffy and shrewd AI thing that only appears through holograms (through the communication devices) is just incompetent in my eyes. The thing isn\u2019t even neutral like you expect him to be and is aligned with a certain magical girl in the social experiment.  Fav is unjust, there is no concise and clear instructions made despite having an initial rundown on the rules. During the experiment, Fav is always adjusting the rules which can be agitating in my eyes as a third-party spectator. For example, always reducing the total numbers of magical girls limit to better \u2018distribute\u2019 the magical candies. I\u2019ve explained it above and this shows you why it\u2019s just a simple killing game with no substance.\\n\\n\r\nThe level of violence and profanity is a tad bit excessive in my opinion, with the show presenting majority of conflicts as being gore-fests meant to shock the viewer in all means possible. Death plays a pivotal role in how the characters develop, with many of them being direct casualties thus I find it redundant that some mourn for their allies despite being informed of the consequences. What the series performs well in are the number of alliances that is evident between participants. The concepts of deceit and betrayal is magnificently done with certain plot twists arising because of that. The amount of backstabbing witnessed in this social experiment is a valid representation of human behaviour when dealing with a life or death situation. The idea of being pitted against one other is detrimental for one\u2019s frame of mind and this anime does a superb job at portraying the despair and bleakness.\\n\\n\r\nThis was also going to be a complaint of mine from the beginning and so you could do say that it was inevitable. Plot armour is deemed to be one of the most exhausted plot conveniences. If you have main characters such as Snow White and Ripple, it is only natural you expect them to make it till the end. The same rules apply to overpowered characters such as Cranberry and Swim Swim who display abilities that are overbearing compared to other magical girls. The survival of the fittest concept works wonders in a battle royale format considering it weeds out the weaker participants that die off first. This show could have been a great subversion if it tried to do things differently but instead we got the usual which is disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterisation of the cast is a bit mind boggling at times. Every single magical girl is given flashbacks which I find to be quite lazy and uncreative. The show is being melodramatic when it presents the sad backstory of a girl/boy trying to evoke emotion out of me. Every character has similar unfortunate circumstances making it difficult to differentiate characters based on prior experiences. The only one I can think of would be Top Speed who had a relatively normal backstory, she is not a deranged individual and exhibits qualities that of a kind and endearing person. The only dynamic characters I find even remotely interesting are Ripple and Swim Swim who\u2019ve had various setbacks and proactively learn from them.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by studio Lerche (Assassination Classroom, Gakkougurashi!) is well produced and there isn\u2019t anything being sub-par in quality. The action scenes which are frantic and erratic are well produced and goes hand in hand with the colouring scheme which just adds to my immersion. The art style which includes the character designs is generally pleasant. The designs for the magical girls are very cute and adorable (would be a discredit to lolis) which is synonymous with the sub-genre. Each character was given a unique selling point making it easy to recognise them instantaneously. \\n\\n\r\nThe music composition is done by Iga Takurou who is a relative newcomer with hardly any titles worth mentioning. The opening was standard for a show but the ending was fantastic listening to repeatedly as it complemented the background scenery. The insert music used within the show usually only manifested itself in the intense scenes, where events leading to deaths were made better through careful track selection. There were plenty of occasions in which individual piano scores were used during somewhat miserable scenes which I found was appropriate. The music is not the selling point of the show as other aspects such as animation are much better.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not really impressed with anything apart from the animation and art style which are top notch for its setting. The plot however is kind of forgettable and certainly needs to be revised to give a better experience. This is adapted from a light novel, so you may check that out if this series is to your liking. The lack of clarity with the game rules is probably its downfall which is a shame as it had much more to offer.",

I was looking for a dark magical girl anime and came across this!\r\nI would recommend but of course like most animes it has flaws.\r\n{Story 8/10}\r\nThe story was good, I liked how it was different to Madoka Magica, but it still carried the dark magical girl aspect. The story was sad and I really wanted to kill Fav, freaking fav. But it was a bit quick at the start. All of a sudden she was a magical girl, then it turned into the hunger games in less than 2 episodes. If they had an extra episode showing us different good deeds and how themagical girls get along it would have added a lot to the anime.\\n\\n\r\n{Art 9/10}\\n\r\nThe art was amazing! The character designs were so cute and unique. The style wasn't messy or sketchy, and very clean. The animation scenes were very realistic too. Like when La Pucelle was thrown face first into concrete, instead of having- I don't know- a scratch, her face was covered in blood like it should have been.\\n\\n\r\n{Sound 9/10}\\n\r\nThe sound was good quality, and the voice actors portrayed the characters really well. You could hear the emotions and distress from the characters and it was good. :>\\n\\n\r\n{Characters 8/10}\\n\r\nThe anime was a little rushed so getting connected to the characters at the start was a bit hard. But I must admit I cried at like 5 deaths. (La Pucelle, Top speed, Sister nana, Hardgore Alice, and Tama) \\n\r\nBut the main character, Snow White, was the typical useless optimistic protagonist and frankly kind of annoyed me. \\n\\n\r\n{Enjoyment 8/10}\\n\r\nI truely enjoyed the anime, and I've watched it 3 times. Each time making me love it more! \\n\\n\r\n{Overall 8/10}\\n\r\nGood anime! One of my favourite, and would recommend. :3",

What angers you, or more accurately frustrates you, is the absolutely squandered potential of each and every one of them over the course of the show. \r\nOn top of that, everything is very predictable.  Who'lldie next, why everything's happening, who will be the last one standing... And the motivation behind the conflict is not only revealed halfway through the show, rendering there no surprise or twist to be given but on top of that, it's very shallow to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nTo be clear, I don't hate this show. I absolutely adore the characters. I hate how much the show failed me, disappointed me and let me down. I had very high hopes for it.",

Character development is all rushed and last minute to the point where it's kind of insulting that we're supposed to care about the characters at all. The weakest character happens to be our protagonist, who hardly gets any screen time and doesn't develop very much at all throughout most of the season. Then again, she's the only character who reacts to her circumstances like a real person. Everyone else just kind of hopped on board the death and murder train the second they foundout about it. The character designs are kinda wonky. It the classic anime problem of having eyes too big, set too far apart with no nose to speak of with the added dimension that you really can't tell how old anyone is really supposed to be. Everyone looks either 5, 15, or 25 and the only real difference between the three is their relative heights. The story beats are kind of tired and uninspired. I feel like this anime was shooting for Madoka Magica but missed and landed entirely in schlock-land. But hey, if you just want to see a bunch of girls kill each other, this is good enough. It was fair enough for me to watch the whole thing at least.",

            "content": "Do you like poorly written stories with little bit of complexity, horrible characters and a plot that will make you say \"mm, that's ok, i guess\" ? Well, Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku might be for you.  Yes, it's a Hunger Games with Magical Girls.  Excuse me if my review seems like a spoiler, but it isn't.  This anime is so poorly written that is predictable.  \r\nStory 3/10\r\nWhat happens when an anime based on a game doesn't follow its own rules? Well, this happens. I will quote Danganronpa.  Danganronpa was a killing game that had precise rules: they will apply toanyone and they will be followed no matter what.  This anime doesn't do this.  At first, they tell you they need to cut the magical girls to 8, then they tell you you can buy magical items to get an advantage, then they tell you that they have to modify the rules yet again so the plot keeps going.  This is totally dumb and unimaginative.  Instead of the girls trying to figure out how to avoid getting killed by following the rules, they are forced to do stupid things like buying magical items.  \\n\\n\r\nThen I must tell you this is heavily rushed.  At first i felt the pacing was just right, but then we get 4 deaths in an episode.  That means 12 minutes of flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nBut the greatest sin of this anime is letting you know who is going to die just before they do.  I feel like watching Akame ga Kill, when someone is about to die, they just show you a flashback of how this magical girl got her powers.  And even after all this senseless slaughter, it was completely predictable who was going to win.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\\n\r\nPathetic.  Characters are pathetic.  We have Snow White, she doesn't do anything at all except crying while everyone wants to protect her for some reason.  People tell me not to compare her to Madoka, well, she's Madoka, except she doesn't do anything at all in the end.  Then we have Ripple and Hardgore Alice which admire Snow White for some reason, in a Homura way, I guess.  The cast is divided in 2: bad magical girls and good magical girls that protect Snow White.  Fav is a Monokuma-Kyubei clone and it's dumb.  Also, all of the cast get like 3 minutes of development prior to her deaths.  I'm sorry, but this is not how you write a character.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't even remember the ending because I skipped it, generic.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe designs were good, I must admit.  But I hate the placement.  They all fight in the city at night, and they don't do anything else.  Most of the fights develop in a building's ceiling.  Cool, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\\n\r\nDecent entertainment because you are trying to figure out who is going to get killled next...then the death flag appears.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is a poor anime.  Bad story, bad writing, terrible characters.  Even the fans of gore will likely find amusement in another story.  Please avoid it at all costs.",

            "content": "Preface:\r\nSince quoting philosophers out of context and completely out of place is the bread and butter for each and every self-proclaimed ANIME EXPERT amongst MAL reviewers out there, I figured I might as well kick this one off just like that.\r\nWith that said, Immanuel Kant once used to say \"blablabla and then some more, Top Speed/Winterprison/Hardgore Alice BEST GIRL\" and just like that or perhaps even not, most people simply Madokan't believe it whenever there's a new dark magical girl anime since let's be really, really honest: There's only so much you can deconstruct and when, back in the days, Urobuchi Gen invented magic, sufferingand, of course, girls, we all knew the cheap copycats would want to have a piece of the cake as well.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I think stiff Madokants shouldn't really lose their heads over there being other things right next to their favorite title but what do I even know.\\n\\n\r\nIn more recent news, the review itself features spoilers yet no scores and also doesn't mention Madoka since I figured that'd be for the better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWriting:\\n\r\nYou know, I'm really glad about what MahoIku isn't: This could have gone down the Akuma no Riddle or Mirai Nikki route of one cannon fodder after another challenging only the really boring protagonists and getting offscreened as a result but I'm really glad it didn't and achieved what these two couldn't: Bringing to life a rather diverse, colorful cast of characters where you're actually inclined to pick your many favorites.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to this essentially being another Battle Royale-esque story following the very primitive principle of getting you to like a few characters and then taking them away from your clutches because now that's how you get an emotional reaction from your audience. It admittedly lacks any sort of grace, yes, but if executed well, can work some wonders. Does MahoIku achieve that though? Actually, yes, mostly.\\n\\n\r\nThere is reason for me to believe that the author is really, really clever, namely him bringing his A game to the table with conceptually smart ideas as far as the characters are concerned:\\n\\n\r\n- Ruler is among the hardworking elite on paper except life played her a different card and now she's stuck with making coffee and given her superior, one can't fault her too much for probably thinking she's the smartest person in the room. This, of course, leads to an inferiority complex and the strong desire to boss other people around, something her power does for her except it's specific enough for her to need help by other people. Ironically, several of her servants would argue she doesn't behave any different from her actual boss (which I'd disagree with but oh well) and what causes her undoing is one of her subjects taking her orders too seriously at any given point of time.\\n\r\n- Cranberry, on paper and in practice, is the strongest character around but due to her own tunnel vision of only seeking the strong, doesn't really accomplish any of her goals and gets killed by Tama, the weakest character who only ever strolled along.\\n\r\n- Winterprison comes across as someone not very good at socializing apart from interacting with her lover Sister Nana, who, very much on the opposite end, takes socializing to the point where she genuinely believes that making friends in a death game would be the best way to go which goes down as badly as you'd expect, with Winterprison sacrificing her own life to ensure Nana's survival who, however, couldn't live without Winterprison and chooses suicide instead. This was generally really well done as their romance was quite possibly the most genuine, heartfelt one I've seen in 2016 and the characters had all the necessary build up for their conclusion to be quite a blow to the stomach.\\n\r\n- Hardgore Alice is brilliant insofar as that everything from the first time she gets mentioned screams \"Surely she's a villain!\": She's the mysterious sixteenth person thrown into a death game, has an unhealthy obsession for the protagonist, kills someone in cold blood the moment she meets her, has the cloth of a dark goth girl and her name contains \"Hardgore\", albeit only because her powers lead to her getting turned to mincemeat but how were we supposed to know? The audience is with Snow White insofar as that almost everything revolving around Alice leads up to misinterpretation (fun fact: in the fanbook, she gets five stars for \"Wrong First Impression\") until you really get to know her and she's about the nicest girl in the universe. Her power also matches her greatly as in that he always wanted to die before meeting Snow White, yet can't in magical girl form, only to die in human form after finding hope for herself.\\n\r\n- Calamity Mary, someone who's never been up to any good as someone who divorced her husband and hit her child, gets a companian through Magicaloid, who's a homeless teenage girl with no parents around. The writing sadly doesn't really do much with that but it's a cool thing on paper at least.\\n\r\n- The family theme goes on with Ripple, someone who had a genuinely terrible family life, moved out and is now going through some hard times and Top Speed, someone who used to be a troublemaker in the past and can therefore relate to Ripple and wants her to change accordingly just like herself, now a soon-to-be (or not) loving mother. While Ripple's growth feels somewhat artificial (as she only really warms up a few second before Top Speed's death), it's generally neatly done.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, MahoIku really doesn't go by the numbers but at the same time, also doesn't construct and kill off its characters without rhyme or reason. Needless to say, being able to actually care about these characters is a good thing for an anime like this. Its setup is primitive in nature but that gets saved by the capable execution.\\n\\n\r\nAntagonist-wise, MahoIku plays some genuinely interesting cards as well yet overall leaves behind a bit of a lacking aftertaste though:\\n\r\n- First we have Calamity Mary who fares really well - you're not supposed to like her but she manages to impress nonetheless. Her fight against Hardgore Alice is the smartest in the series and she gets incredibly thorough with it. She's clearly established as a strong threat from the very beginning on but is also level-headed to a certain degree or else she wouldn't have accepted Magicaloid or played GTA: Real Life Edition to get Top Speed and Ripple back on track. There's a bit of a system to her madness and that's a good thing. With all that said though, her getting offed by ninja stars just like that was quite a low point of the show.\\n\r\n- Cranberry initially succeeds as the character we know nothing about other than her being a whole lot of trouble but her involvement with the other characters is so non-existent, it sure makes one wonder. She was passive enough with Winterprison to not get anything out of it, never even considered fighting Mary and her faux backstory gave us nothing on her before she left this world behind.\\n\r\n- Swim Swim is a fascinating concept taken to the logical extreme and established a coup d'etat we didn't really see coming but she gets stale after a while. She admittedly got some really good killings out of the show but practically offed six characters with the motivation of \"That one dead character once said this and that\". She's an unconventional villain no doubt but at some point, was only there to kill your favorite character (she got all three of mine, so there's that) and that felt rather lacklustre. It also severely limits the variancy among match-ups which became noticable every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I'd still like to applaud MahoIku for being generally unconventional with its figures as that's a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nAs MahoIku also features a good chunk of action, I'd also like to mention that one's writing at least once as it positively stands out most of the time. Admittedly, there are some fights that felt like a grind (Mary vs Ripple) but in general, there is some creative use of tactics and gimmicks. A four on one battle such as with Winterprison is supposed to feel like a mess and with walls popping out of nowhere, someone's skull getting crushed (now THAT was satisfying to watch), the entire floor collapsing and an arm getting severed, MahoIku gets the job done. I've also mentioned Mary vs Alice before and that one really should drive the point home that action certainly isn't one of MahoIku's weaknesses luckily.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhich isn't to say that MahoIku is perfect and I do have a few issues with it:\\n\r\nThe first two episodes deliver on a really ungood package. Starting out the show with sixteen minutes of that one really bland protagonist who's obsessed with magical girls wouldn't sit well with anyone and even at the end of episode 02, all the anime had delivered on was that one twist we all saw coming. In general, these episodes' biggest weakness is that they are very heavy on Snow White and she is really boring, she's the protagonist but refuses to be part of her own show to the point of being the least influential character around and while everyone was busy thinking and doing things, she just kind of moped around until the end of the show and that's it. I suppose it was for the better since her eating up screentime would have been disastrous due to how bland she was but I can't really say \"Way to go, protagonist, you were a vital and interesting element to the show!\". The less said about her the better.\\n\\n\r\nSome deaths towards the end also were all sorts of crammed in and felt like they just had to be there to write characters out of the show: I've already mentioned Mary's and Cranberry's above so let's move past that but Top Speed's wasn't particularly stellar either. It had the element of surprise on its side but it was hard to get emotionally invested, as what followed was a really badly done battle with no conclusion, stretching the distance between the audience and Top Speed's death, leading to little more than Ripple staring in shock at Top Speed's corpse. Admittedly, the two of them got fantastic closure in episode 11 but the death itself was lacklustre to say the least. On that note, Swim Swim killing off Top Speed due to a surprise attack made little sense as it would have been smarter to get rid of Ripple first and Top Speed being good friends with Ruler really didn't go anywhere in regards to that. Going back to episode 03 and seeing Top Speed offer Swim Swim a ride, saying \"We're going to be good friends!\" is hilariously ironic though.\\n\r\nAlice's death was also rather dumb as \"I can't focus to transform back into a magical girl\" was a really cheap excuse and while her flashback story started out promising, it really didn't go into the specifics or felt well-rounded, not to mention Snow White picking up her missing keys back in the beginning didn't quite carry as much weight as it should have and I felt all of that was really shallow and a disservice to her character.\\n\r\nAnd then there's Sister Nana, someone who really should have kicked the bucket at the end of her own episode. With that said, these are five out of twelve deaths so you do the maths.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the issue of flashback stories being shoehorned in right before a character dies, making the flow of events really predictable. Frequently, the flashbacks themselves are effective at what they set out to do but the anime hardly gets to wow you over that one death you didn't see coming (there are some flashbacks not set right before the crucial moment though, take Mary's, Top Speed's or Tama's).\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, Ripple and Snow White surviving was a rather foreseeable conclusion and while I think that MahoIku ending on a human coming of age note (Ripple having both a scar and Top Speed's cloak was neat symbolism and a reminder for her growth), it's still a bit of a shame we barely got any backgrounds on why any of this took place to begin with. Something less abstract than a vague two minutes infodump from Fav would have been preferable but oh well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAudiovisual Execution:\\n\r\nHey, guys, it's Lerche! Rings any bells? No? Well, let me name a bit of their TV output: P4, DeSu 2, Dangan Ronpa, MajiKoi, the Hamatora sequel and you're slowly but surely getting the gist that these guys are a small studio frequently running into production problems and while there have been laudable exceptions (hearsay has it Gakkou Gurashi is one of them, MonMusu had the Arve Rezzle/Muromi-san sakuga backing and Ranpo Kitan, while hardly outstandingly produced, was Kishi working stage play-esque wonders for the direction by not being directly involved with a single episode, don't ask me how that works), MahoIku unfortunately doesn't fall into the category of better looking anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is not to say that it looks disastrous but occasionally, things do get really ugly, especially Ripple's first fight against Swim Swim which looked like shit and was insanely hard to follow and that's not a good thing. As far as battles in general are concerned, you're hardly in for any sakuga miracles and I can't recall a single one that was genuinely well-animated but for what it's worth, the action animation is passable. Not much to see there but hardly a collection of poorly put together stills and speedlines either. Every now and then, the anime even does bring some nice imagery to the table, take La Pucelle's/Snow White's rooftop scene or Top Speed and Ripple having their final goodbye and rarely, there's a bit more of slight stylization with its art going on but with all that said and done, you really are not watching this for the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nFor what little can be said about it, the soundtrack is rather nice actually. There's hardly a standout piece that would come to your mind thinking of MahoIku's scoring but I've kept a note in the back of my head to check out its OST upon its release as several of the darker/more urgent themes struck quite a tune with me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBottom Line:\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I feel like there's a lot I really, really like about this one but also some stuff that's kind of a downer. I just really do think that a better execution at times could have really saved the day but time constraints are a thing so most of it was probably hard to avoid.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, I do have my fair share of gripes with this anime as I think there are just too many flaws to get to an area where the really good stuff assembles but hey, at the end of the day, this is still among the best output in 2016 and this franchise has won me over to the point of getting to its source. Something that can't be said for most of the seasonal output out there.",

            "content": "This anime in 8 words: \u201cAnticlimactic Magical Girl Death Game With Wasted Potential \u201d \r\nYes, this is just another magical girl dark twist anime. Unfortunately, it's not that great of one either and here's why:\r\nThis is what a series looks like when it tries to have emotional shock factor, but fails because it's only 12 episodes long and has too many characters. When characters die, most of the times you won't even care because there are too many of them and you don't ever know their backstory until the episode of their death. This series has a damsel in distress, innocent, naive main protagonist. Thereare no moral messages to be gained from this anime and no overarching reasons for the events that happen. It\u2019s, simply put, excessive \u201cjust because\u201d death-game violence. However, I believe it's still worth watching if you like seeing violence and/or the death of magical girls. \\n\\n\r\nI want to note that I actually did enjoy watching the series for the most part, but this is from my unbiased perspective as a person who has seen a lot of anime. It will probably be a lot better to the people that haven't seen as many anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis being a thriller, you should go into series expecting there to be intense, edgy battles and deaths. Most of the characters could have been expanded upon, but weren't, and that largely took away from the potential of the series. I honestly believed that it started off with the potential to be outstanding, but it quickly went downhill once the death game began. The great characters started dying off too quickly without me building any attachment to them. The main protagonist \u201cSnow White\u201d was excessively naive and innocent throughout the whole anime. Consequently, I did not enjoy almost any time she got screentime after the first few episodes because every side-character was significantly more interesting than her.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10 \\n\r\nThe basic premise of the story is that ordinary people were selected to become magical girls while playing a magical girl phone game. They are then forced into a death game where the magical girl with the least amount of \"candies\" at the end of the week dies. They initially gained these candies by performing acts of goodness, but Fav (the Kyubey knockoff) continuously adds in new elements that push some of the magical girls to kill each other instead. This is definitely not a \"psychological\" series; you can tell as it presents itself in the cliche, archetypal, non-unique characters. Taking that into consideration, I feel that the writers tried, but failed, to portray powerful concepts like friendship, desperation, loss, and psychological twists. This is largely because they introduced these archetype characters with amazing potential, but then got rid of them just as fast. Unfortunately, the fast pacing and the anticlimactic ending left me with feelings of wasted potential as I finished.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art was nothing outstanding, but pretty good. There wasn\u2019t anything particularly unique about it. I enjoyed the battle scenes and the fluidity of the animation. The characters were a bit too colorful and cute for me personally, but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. The brightness of the characters in combination with the dark background made the series feel less dark and more lighthearted. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10 \\n\r\nNon-unique, average, unmemorable ost. Although, the ending theme was relatively nice. Both the opening and the ending didn\u2019t really suit the anime. Music was a bit too lighthearted for what was happening.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:4/10\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, most of the characters die soon after they\u2019re introduced. I liked most of them because of their diverse personalities, but I don't think you will be getting any new favorite characters out of this anime. If this anime was a real magical girl series with the same characters and similar deaths, I feel that it would have been significantly better. Most of the characters had great potential for development, but I could not form any attachments to any of them because of their short screen time and lack of backstories until the moment before their death. It was such a waste\u2026 *shakes head*\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6.5/10\\n\r\nAll things considered, it was alright. Never watching it again, but I don\u2019t regret watching it at all. The fighting and characters were enjoyable enough for me to continue watching it this season. I looked forward to seeing what would happen in each new episode, but the end of the series made me feel that it\u2019s just anticlimactic overall with nothing to be gained from the resolution (not even satisfaction). I would watch a season two to see where they go from here because it's still entertaining nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nI can't give this series any higher than a 7 because it wasn't really that good and no less than a 5 because it certainly wasn't below average overall.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: Would I recommend this to you? \\n\r\nIf all you want is the gore/killing, then absolutely. \\n\r\nIf you want a great story, then no it\u2019s just wasted potential. \\n\r\nIf you want both, then try Madoka Magica, Fate/Zero (anything but Ilya from the \"Fate/\" Series), Akame Ga Kill, or Mirai Nikki. \\n\r\nIf you want a similar concept that\u2019s better imo, then try Madoka Magica, Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha, or Btoom.\\n\\n\r\nHope this helps you make your decision! If so, let me know by clicking helpful! If not, let me know why you disagree~\\n",

            "content": "\u201cI kinda like it when a lotta people die.\u201d --George Carlin\r\nSometimes, all you need is kill. Ing. That\u2019s what I was looking for with Magipro. I was a little stressed, you see. I was in a weird spot at the beginning of the season: pets dying, mothers hospitalized, promotions at work, dads who live forty miles away and need rides to work another forty miles away. Oh my god. I have RESPONSIBILITIES?! \r\nTough times call for easy viewing. I wanted something that I didn\u2019t have to think about. Something fun. And the synopsis of Magipro fit the bill. Magical girls killing each other? Don\u2019t carewhy, I wanna see it. People dying is sensational and thrilling. Violence, murder, blood, death, despair! Sometimes, all we need is a little action. Fantasy is for the things we don\u2019t want to experience. It\u2019s all just for fun. Kill to thrill. It\u2019s no fun \u2018till someone dies.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s why\u2026 I was actually disappointed with Magipro when it started. They give an obvious implication that things will go very wrong for everyone on screen, but if it weren\u2019t for that small foreshadowing then this would\u2019ve been seen as nothing more than a mediocre mahou shoujo anime. It starts off with talking. Then more talking. Followed by more fucking talking. Then the main character gets a template-level transformation and runs around town helping strangers over some exposition and incredibly light music. Where\u2019s the charm? Where\u2019s the MAGIC? Being a magical girl sounds really fucking boring given this show\u2019s depiction of it. Madoka Magica was such a thrill because it had a really interesting depiction of magical girls until things got really fucked up. In Magipro, dying is the most interesting thing you could do.\\n\\n\r\nI need to pause for a moment to calmly explain to you, kind readers, that if you continue comparing a show that is nothing more than a bloodbath to a complete deconstruction of an entire genre, I will find you, rip your arms off, and recreate Sentarou\u2019s drum solo from the pilot of Kids on the Slope using your severed limbs as drumsticks. Please stop making this retarded comparison. The shows have nothing in common beyond being dark magical girl shows, and Magipro doesn\u2019t even hold a candle to Madoka\u2019s spectacle.\\n\\n\r\nNow, back to the review.\\n\\n\r\nSoon enough, the killings begin! ...In the form of really soft and boring deaths. Magipro is more of a competition in the beginning with the weakest link getting killed off. This is then revealed to the other girls by a couple people gathering info and sharing it around. They then complain by gathering in a chatroom and arguing with something that that is way too obviously a combination of Kyubey from Madoka and Monokuma from Danganronpa. Yawn. Where\u2019s the drama? Someone just fucking DIED for fuck\u2019s sake! Where\u2019s the intensity?! \\n\\n\r\nAlright, so eventually they start killing each other\u2026 it\u2019s kinda nice, but also\u2026 I dunno, tame? No single fight nor death stuck out to me. There\u2019s not much else to the show beyond magical girls killing each other, so you\u2019d think this would be played up much more. Nah, no one had a crushingly brutal death, it\u2019s more like they just lost in a fight and death was more of a side effect. I\u2019d recommend seeing your doctor if you get a side effect of death, though. But there IS a lot of blood. Blood is fun, so the more there is, the better. One scene had multiple characters die in the same place, with blood splashing over some other characters. I jerked off to it. It was art.\\n\\n\r\nOne good thing about all the deaths is that they come at a pretty alarming rate. Perhaps it\u2019s for the anime\u2019s benefit that few people die in the early episodes, because that means multiple deaths in each episode later on. That\u2019s when things get fun.\\n\\n\r\nThe way things play out can be interesting. Magical girls form pairs or teams, leading to tag-team fights and surprising betrayals. The drama is surprisingly decent, but it\u2019s not too hard to throw in a bunch of crazy shit happening with a cast of sixteen characters. But still, it was nice to see certain bitches get double-crossed and some deaths can be unexpected. Except for\u2026 you know, the ones that happen about five minutes after someone\u2019s backstory is revealed. Death flags are thrown around a lot, and that\u2019s no fun. It\u2019s like hearing what you\u2019re gonna get for Christmas. I can\u2019t be surprised about getting a PS4 and now Christmas sucks. Thanks, Trump.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren\u2019t that good since they\u2019re all meant to die anyway, but I still found myself rather amused by most of them. Many of them have their own idea of what it means to be a magical girl, and their access to power twists their mind a little. Say what you want about how bitchy Ruler is, she was one of the strongest characters. But none can compare to best girl TOPU SPEEDO. She wears a big witch hat and rides a broom. Everyone else go home. Anyway, the characters are just adequate--when the backstories are timed well, they\u2019re actually pretty satisfying. Seeing a person\u2019s life before their transformation and how much they\u2019ve changed was interesting.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, NONE of the above can be said about the main character, Snow White. She is an utterly atrocious character. There might as well have not been a lead, because she literally does jack shit besides cry, get upset, cry, lament about people dying, cry, and complain about her definition of being a magical girl not getting across to anyone else. Tough luck, bitch, go fucking murder people. I need to watch things die at a good safe distance, and you\u2019re not helping. Why is she here? Can her parents please pick her up? \\n\r\nI mean, it\u2019s cool that she\u2019s the innocent character who cries about death all the time, but the fact that she isn\u2019t even around for 80% of the time means she probably gets less screentime than several other people. Kinda hard to consider her the lead at this point. If she were at least part of the action and tried interfering with people every now and then, I could get behind her involvement, but I\u2019m not joking when I say that she did nothing in the entire season. She makes Yukiteru Amano look like Yuno Gasai.\\n\\n\r\nTheir designs are pretty great for the most part and have a lot of detail and personality to them, but uh\u2026 what\u2019s with all the fanservice? No, I\u2019m not about to go \u201cWAHHHH! THERE\u2019S CLEAVAGE IN MY ANIME, MAKE IT STOP!!! WAAAAAAHHHH!!\u201d It\u2019s just weird when half the girls have big tits and wear super revealing and tight-fitting outfits to compliment their big tits, and the other half are practically flat and wear more creative and cutesy outfits. I don\u2019t mind fanservice as a whole, and some sexuality is always expected, but goddamn, Magipro. Why don't you just dispense paper towels at the start of every episode? Top Speed still the hottest though. Get a witch hat, idiots.\\n\\n\r\nBut the best thing, of all things\u2026 are the names. Goddamn do these characters have beautiful names. Ripple. Calamity Mary. Winterprison. Hardgore Alice. Izetta the Last Witch. Holy fuck these are edgy. That\u2019s so cool. I love them so much. I like edgy things because I like having fun every once in a while and don\u2019t need to look mature by putting down teenage angst. I embrace it when it doesn\u2019t go too far because it\u2019s fun. Magipro is fun. It can afford to be a little edgier, though.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Magipro had some good moments. It ultimately delivered on its promise--a bunch of cute girls dying. It did what it was asked to, but didn\u2019t exceed expectations nor disappoint. It was just a perfectly adequate job. Watching it was tiring at first, but I found myself having fun after a few slow episodes. In the end, that\u2019s what matters, even if it could\u2019ve been better. I recommend it for that, but I\u2019m sure there are much better battle royales out there. Hell, I would actually say that Mirai Nikki is unironically better. Might need to put a trigger warning somewhere, though.\\n\r\nI gave it a 5 because that\u2019s average. It\u2019s not a low score, it\u2019s the midpoint between 1 and 10. Don\u2019t blame me for having \u201clow scores\u201d if you think 7.7 is \u201caverage\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nOh, I guess I forgot the art and sound sections. Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yep they exist. Alright, got that taken care of.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nArt - 5/10\\n\r\nSound - 5/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5/10\\n\r\nTop Speed  - 55/10\\n\r\nOverall - 5.5/10\\n\r\nFavorite character - PM me Top Speed hentai\\n\r\nFavorite episode - not 9 that\u2019s for fucking sure\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku,  yet another entry for the \"dark and edgy\" as well as unnecessarily sophisticated \"mature\" magical girl genre.\r\nThe Magical Girl Raising Project took a creative risk to introduce the completely original and unique concept (*major sarcasm) of the dark side of Mahou Shoujo\u2018s to audiences. Plot: Girl(s) with ``surprise surprise\u2019\u2019 problems in the real world distract themselves from their problems by playing a free to play (*with micro transactions) magical girl game on their android or IOS devices. But! Get this, in the game The Magical Girl Raising Project, one in tens of thousands of people to get to be areal \"magical girl\u201d even guys apparently... that\u2019s a spoiler for another day.  Besides the unwanted shock at the beginning of the series, the plot of the story was for the magical girls\u2019 to race each other and collect more \"magical candies\" than their competitors. You know, a sweet and fun game that young girls would probably play\u2026 maxing out their parent\u2019s credit cards on the micro transaction, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this changed however, and the edginess kicked in. Instead of working together to defeat the common evil, the girls instead start killing each other because that is the easiest and most logical solution to solving problems.\\n\r\nThe edginess and darkness that the story adds for shock value is simply repulsive. There was too much effort made to try and set this title apart from similar mahou shoujo titles with unique rules stipulations. Often time given out by some sort of creature or deity. I felt that the entire story was supposed to be going for \u201cuniqueness\u201d and there is no doubt that the staff reached their goal however, somewhere along the lines the staff got too involved in trying to recreate the same ``dark & edgy\u2019\u2019 formula seen in titles like Yuuki Yuuna is a hero, and Mahou Shoujo Madoka. So to a certain extent it just feels like watching a knock-off version of YuYu or Madoka.\\n\\n\r\nThis approach took away a lot of the good parts and redeeming qualities that the story had to offer. Rather than focusing on a story that branches out more on the game and characters, you\u2019re greeted to a blood fest rumble where the main focus leans on shock value and a darker narrative. The story feels too constricted as well as repetitive with it's choices in storytelling. The most noticeable patterns are plot twist, shocking moments, and of course blood and gore. There are lighter times however; they are kept to a minimal. Only to be used when they need to add a quick plot twist. Because of the lack of freedom in the story, I found it difficult to remain engaged and satisfied with the events taking place in the story.  \\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is impressive nonetheless! Lerche is a pretty reputable studio putting out hit titles like Assassination classroom, Danganronpa, School-Live (*maybe not so much) and of course Monster Musume. All shows with amazing visuals and special effects. I found myself most intrigued by the battles in rising project, which should be no surprise. The destruction of scenery coupled with the determination and fear on most girls\u2019 faces while fighting were well displayed. I felt like the visual tension between the characters made most fight scenes feel more dramatic too.The best fights where the animation felt clean and fluent had involved Calamity Mary and Cranberry. So I would highly recommend watching them in action. I mean you know a battle is done right when you want to go back and re-watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack fits the atmosphere of the battles. The well composed songs create a good amount of tension and exciting during events throughout the anime. While I felt the soundtrack was good, I did feel like it lacked the replay value and lasting effect that puella magi madoka magica soundtrack had. That aside, the voice actors were pretty good. I felt like each actor did an amazing job representing their perspective characters and giving them personality\u2026 except that dog girl whose name I cannot remember, and I\u2019m too lazy to go close out of word and Google it. I\u2019ll probably edit this out\u2026 or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of the series would have to be the fighting.  I would\u2019ve said drama however, Magical girl rising project is the kind of show where the drama tends to drag on. It goes on to the point where you\u2019ll probably lose interest and skip forward a little. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the show isn\u2019t \u201cbad\u201d as in \u201cthe worst thing ever.\u201d It\u2019s just full of too many clich\u00e9\u2019s and predictable moments depending on how experienced you are when it comes to watching anime. If there were any changes that needed to be made for the shows second season, if green lit. I would hope that they use an approach that isn\u2019t so\u2026 one-sided. I want to see more than just violence and drama. I would like to see more into the characters daily lives and happier moments that last longer than 6 minutes (in screen-time.)\\n\\n\r\nI gave Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku a 7/10 because I felt like despite all of the problems the show presents, it still manages to captivate audiences with its intense fights, drama, and unique cast of characters. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku - One more \"Mahou Shoujo\" to the collection\r\nI realize there are \"mahou\" animes but I do not understand why they have to be so bad. \r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is an example of how a \"magical\" anime manages to be tragic.\r\nThe synopsis tells us that there is a social game called \"The Magical Girl Raising Project\" that allows one of them to be chosen to be a \"magic girl\" within a group of people (hence the tone \"mahou\" of the whole anime), which means she will have extraordinary physical abilities as well as magical powers that differentiate from the rest fromthe humans. What happens next is that, in a district where there are 16 girls, the administration thinks it should reduce the number of \"magic girls\" where each one should consume some \"magic candies\" but something becomes twisted and then the anime turns out into a giant plotwist for survival.\\n\\n\r\nSince the concepts of \"mahou\" animation from Cardcaptor Sakura to Madoka Magica, mahou anime were always in a fan idea, yet it is not exactly a genre that can be enjoyed to the fullest because it is not generally interesting, so it is normal to people ignore it. Unlike other anime of the same genre, Ikusei Keikaru is everything but original, this series lives basically and during the episodes, the typical clich\u00e9. It's pretty clear that every character who has (or counts or shows) a backstory is pretty much a victim of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nIn a certain part of the story, the writers should have decided that the anime alone was not edgy enough, unless the characters passed on their way of life as a form of currency. It's a little hard to understand, but let's just say it's like stepping on legos, it hurts but then it's okay. In terms of art, the anime is horribly bad, not as bad as Dangaronpa for example but it is down the middle. The design of the characters is a disaster and honestly it was the part that I really didn't liked in the series. When I say that art is bad, I am also talking about the characters.The anime starts from the first episode to be defined with the tag good vs bad so it is possibly what \"feeds\" the series. In fact, no character is able to \"save\" the series because in general, the characters are very limited.\\n\\n\r\nAn \"mahou\" anime can not have more than four characters as main characters and even then four is already a lot, the ideal is really three for each fight or a goal and better the anime mahou, in general.Now, the problem resides in the Rest of the characters, this rest is all those that appear in two or three episodes and die without having their moment of the series. The more the part of the series that has each person has an arc, half of the episodes neither serves for nothing by that person is dies and is dies, all was in vain.\\n\\n\r\nI had this anime in my plan to watch because I was missing the animes that came through in the old days and that I came to see more recently, but I was not expecting anything like this. This anime is super annoying and I advise no one to see it, unless you are a person that is an undisputed hardcore fan who thinks that all animes are really good but still (Mahou Shoujo) Ikusei Keikaru proves that no.",

            "content": "Ohhh not another dark reconstruction of the magical girl genre...yes, but it's also it's own thing at the same time.\r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku has a social game of becoming magical girls turned battle royale and sure on the surface it looks like a Puella Madoka Magica ripoff just under a \"social game setting\", but as much as Puella Madoka Magica comes at you with it's dark themes so suddenly without warning, Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku goes for the more slower approach and giving us some VERY well done anti-villains along the way.\r\nIn terms of characters, it is one of greatest strengths towards the entire \"BattleRoyale but under the social game schema\", but it has it's ups and downs concerning if it's towards the more level-headed peaceful characters or the more psychotic ones. If it's towards the peaceful characters, LA gets it that some want to keep to the \"rules\" of the game, but it leads to be too naive of the plot at hand and the more obvious being having an easy target on you, the easiest towards this goes to Sister Nana voiced by Saori Hayami, Snow White voiced by Nao Touyama (especially at the start) and Top Speed voiced by Yumi Uchiyama. On the other spectrum, the more psychotic characters actually makes the anime's plot move forward and alot more interesting what with their character backstory as to how they became magical girl and for what reasoning, as much as this statement kinda of sounds like what Fav voiced by Kurumi Mamiya, the mascot of the Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku (and obvious Kyubey stand-in), but in terms of plot and interest, the anime wouldn't been this interesting enough, anyways the more psychotic characters that fit this bill going to Cranberry voiced by Megumi Ogata, Calamity Mary voiced by Kikuko Inoue and Swim Swim voiced by Inori Minase (halfway through anyways)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters do bring up themes of morality especially from Top Speed, it even brings themes of gender disparity especially from La Pucelle voiced by Ayane Sakura (slight spoilers...but La Pucelle is Snow White's male childhood friend...no LA didn't do a typo, anyways since La Pucelle's interest to magical girls at an early age and was humiliated by his friends, it kinda reflects the ACTUAL audience especially those in the male demographic who watches it..LA doesn't know if it's meant to be a jab at the audience or it's being self-aware that the audience are mainly males and maybe due to the atmosphere of the anime, it makes sense)\\n\\n\r\nThe plot twists really comes in the form of the characters true identities/backstories and how their deaths comes be in the end, some do get a short backstory after their deaths, some goes more into greater detail in order to motivate the other magical girls. What the only flaw to some of the death plot twists comes in form of the backstory coming in as a hint to who's gonna die next (not always but it comes up as a major predictability). Nonetheless the plot twists varies in how it's executed. LA also thinks that because of this, it's less Puella Madoka Magica and the more referenced in this review, Battle Royale. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as deaths are concerned however, LA will say at the very least that due to the major \"villains\" presented and given backstory on, they at the very least helps makes the entire \"Battle Royale\" schema along with the interesting villains propel the plot and makes it all the more interesting what some of the more unhinged and utterly psychotic villains there are, don't forget the magical girls' morals getting put into question along with their social mobile game turn into \"survival\"...and quite later on \"slaughter\".\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by Lerche, it had quite the crisp animation especially concerning the character designs and battle animation and the more brutalized deaths (seemed Lerche is going Danganronpa levels of animation detail). The animation at best was consistent for the majority of the animation, though LA rarely in the later episodes saw the animation dip slightly but not to the point LA wouldn't have distracted LA. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms voice acting, the majority of the voice cast did exceptional, with some standouts going to Kikuko Inoue, Inori Minase and Manami Numakura who voiced by Ripple. As much LA wanted Nao Touyama to be LA's favourite in this section, she did at best, her typical genki girl archetype though towards the end of the anime she showed a bit more, no LA's favourite voice actors would go to Kikuko Inoue and Kurumi Mamiya who voiced Fav.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was at best, showing Fav's true colors and at the same time, it was solely a satisfying ending, though the \"final battle\" felt slightly anti-climaxed, nonetheless, it made sure the anime ENDED without any hint of a second season, it concluded the anime quite nicely with all thing considered even with it's slight anti-climax. \\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku maybe seen as another ripoff of the dark magical girls trying to STILL ride on the coat-tails of the Puella Madoka Magica, but for all LA can see, it's definitely trying to be it's own thing and sure the allusions of Madoka are there (Snow White's pink hair, her indecisiveness, the dark themes, a mascot character with ulterior motives etc.), but as LA said at the start of this anime review, it's definitely trying to be it's own thing under a Battle Royale setting with interesting villains and peaceful characters that quite frankly should have been another genre but nonetheless their contrasting personalities towards the social game and it's rules and even better the plot twists to finding out Fav has lied to them raises it as an interesting development. Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku may have it's issues and weakness but they are weighed in favour of it's strong focus, it's themes, questionable villains and indecisive heroes and Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku to be it's own thing.",

            "content": "In recent years there has been the rise of a sub-genre of anime I\u2019d like to call \u2018moe flip\u2019. In this sub-genre, cute characters are immersed in harsh conditions, often brutal, that are unlike what the characters represent by their looks alone. These shows engage the audience through their shock value; having cute characters commit brutal actions or transform into psychological monsters. The masterpieces in this sub-genre go beyond the shock value and deliver compelling characters.\r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is a \u2018moe-flip\u2019 show that excels in delivering great shock value but fails to present meaningful characters.\r\n[Magical girl battle royale]\r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku, or Magical GirlsRaising Project (MGRP for short), is a fantasy thriller adapted from a light novel of the same title by the studio Lerche who\u2019ve also created other \u2018moe-flip\u2019 shows as Gakkougurashi. The story revolves around magical girls (mahou shoujo) who are forced to fight each other for their survival. Himekawa Koyuki, also known as the magical girl Snow White, is thrust into a role so different from what\u2019s she\u2019s dreamed of and tries to stick to her ideals. This task becomes increasingly difficult as the high stakes slowly reveal the monsters that have hidden in the midst of the magical girls.\\n\\n\r\n[Lukewarm reception]\\n\r\nMGRP initially received a lukewarm reception when it began airing on the 2nd of October, 2016. People who\u2019d gotten wary of the abundance of \u2018moe\u2019 anime were turned off by the character designs, calling it another \u2018moe\u2019 show. It\u2019s magical girls theme didn\u2019t help either - but its shock value did. With the first flip, the first death of a magical girl, the interest waxed. And when the show revealed its most influential character, it gained a steady following. This interest was maintained by the shows consistency in delivering shocking events albeit with the absence of a good plot.\\n\\n\r\n[A thin plot]\\n\r\nThe entire plot - or most of it - of MGRP is told in the first two episodes of the show. As with most \u2018moe-flip\u2019 shows, the pacing is not slow; the \u2018flip\u2019 often happens early. The first episode introduces the two main characters, the Magical Girl Rising Project which is actually a mobile game, as well as a few supporting characters. The second episode introduces the major conflict of the show through the death of one of the magical girls. Afterwards, the show became a series of battles with the occasional backstory employed for emotional impact. Unfortunately, this was ineffective as there was too little time to get invested in the characters; a lot of the characters died too quickly. MGRP was a victim of its large cast but there were a few standout characters that drove the story.\\n\\n\r\n[Diverse characters but not much development]\\n\r\nKoyuki is the designated main character, as identified at the beginning of the show and has a few recognizable traits that define her. She\u2019s pure-hearted, diligent and passionate about being a magical girl. As a result, she\u2019s the least prepared for the changes that occur after the game\u2019s mascot, Fav, announces that it\u2019d need to cut down the number of magical girls. She grows during the course of the series, becoming bold enough to choose to rescue people at the risk of being attacked and killed by another magical girl. But at different points in the first few episodes she often has more battle-hardened and mentally strong characters come to her aid. One of those characters is Sazanami Kano, also know as the magical girl Ripple.\\n\\n\r\nKano is one of the few characters in the show that\u2019s well-developed; there are many scenes of Kano outside her magical girl persona unlike most of the cast. She\u2019s introduced as indifferent to the system and the other magical girls but becomes more involved after a traumatic event. She\u2019s stronger than Koyuki psychologically and isn\u2019t afraid to battle with the other magical girls. But Koyuki and Kano are not the most influential characters in the show; that title goes to Sakayagi Ayana, also known as the magical girl Swim Swim.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s difficult to state how compelling Ayana is without spoiling parts of the show. She\u2019s a product of the new system created and uses it to her advantage.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike other magical girl shows that feature high school girls, MGRP has a vast array of characters. There are high school girls, a girl in middle school, an office lady, female college students, a lesbian couple and even a boy. This diverse cast is further augmented by their diverse skills and brilliant character design.\\n\\n\r\n[Great character design with a glum mood]\\n\r\nEach of the magical girls has a unique design that reflects their ability. In fact, all but one of the designs for the characters and their skills were picked by the girls (and boy) themselves. For example, Ruler looks like a princess complete with a cape and sceptre and her ability is to force anyone in front of her to obey her commands. Tama\u2019s ability lets her dig 1m wide holes in any surface and she looks like a dog. The character design is made more remarkable by the art style and the overall mood.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the character art and art within the game is done in a cute style, the background art is not. The backgrounds are mostly done in washed out colours and most of the scenes are at night. This gloomy mood is complemented by the often sober music.\\n\\n\r\n[Fitting music but immemorable scores]\\n\r\nA good aspect of MGRP\u2019s music is that there\u2019s almost no cheery tunes; the tracks always seemed to propel the ominous mood of the show. Unfortunately, they seemed generic; one of the tracks even sounded like it was from a retro video game.\\n\\n\r\nMGRP was enjoyable for its take on the magical girl sub-genre and its shock value. It\u2019s diverse cast made it easier to connect to its characters. A fan of brutal thrillers would find this worth watching.",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is a Hunger Game-esque anime at its core that attempts to bring in an array of \"characters\" with varying magical talents in an attempt to show an edgier side of the Magical Girl genre. Through a mobile app game, girls are chosen by the magical entity Fav for unknown reasons, but they accidentally selected too many girls to become magical girls, and so now they all need to compete in a competition of either gaining the most candies or killing each other (someone will die by the end of the week regardless) in order for them to survive.\r\n-------------------------\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nStory-wise, Ikusei Keikakuis filled to the brim with nothing but terrible cliches. It became clear that any character whose backstory was shown was very likely to be among the victims of that episode, and if that wasn't enough, they made sure to try to employ every type of sympathy-tool for the casual audience as they possibly could.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter death not sad enough? Oh, well, they were pregnant. Also a housewife. Or they helped the homeless. Maybe they were bullied in school. They had found love. Their friend witnessed their death. Or maybe all of the above because this anime really has no dignity in its story. Death means nothing in this show, but I will explore that later on.\\n\\n\r\nAt some point in the series, the writers must have decided that the show just wasn't edgy enough unless the characters spent their life force (measured in years of their life) as a form of currency. I don't particularly count this as a spoiler because it hardly has any actual relevancy in the anime. It's just that they needed something to increase the variety of action in the show, so they added new items and they needed to make it \"dark\" for their teenage audience who thinks they're dark lords, so they made them use 'years of their life' as currency.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nAt first it doesn't really look bad to me, but the more I look at it, the more I'm slightly repulsed by it. I mean, the combat is kind of okay, but the proportions on the characters are pretty bad and the designs themselves are fairly unimaginative. The combat scenes can be alright, they're nothing special or worth noting, but they at least can have a moment of something at least looking decent.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nProbably the best part about the show is its sound. Not even so much the music, which relies on a set few soundtracks to play on repeat through every single episode. It's mostly the magical sound effects that give life to the series. If not for those, this anime likely wouldn't be heralded by much of anyone. My rating for this might actually be more of a case of, \"It's good by comparison to everything else\" rather than it being good as a standalone entity, but I'll stick by my rating of its sound quality for now.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nFor the most part, the characters in Ikusei Keikaku are defined by their abilities and where they fall on the good vs. evil spectrum, with barely anyone at all falling in the middle. Either they're hardcore good or hardcore evil. Even characters that are super evil and have been killing off characters for the duration of the series are given backgrounds that try to \"redeem\" them and try to make the audience have sympathy for them, which really shouldn't work for anyone who isn't just watching for mindless entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters will either be \"I will defend the ones I love!\" or \"I will protect myself by killing those who stand in my way.\" This is pretty much the case for absolutely everyone with maybe one or two exceptions.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime falls drastically to the curse of having too many characters. That might not always be a problem, there are plenty of anime out there that have a wide cast array but still manage to make them feel like more than plot devices. For Ikusei Keikaku, it's more that each character is a cameo appearance until they have their own arc. How do you know its their arc? The episode will introduce their backstory and say \"hey, maybe there's an actual character here\" moments before killing the character off and stopping any hope of feeling any legitimate attachment to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf you feel anything for the characters, I feel like I can definitively say you don't actually like the characters, you just like the atmosphere and the fact that the anime is forcefully telling you to care for them. It's not a natural \"I care for these characters because they're good,\" it's a \"I feel obligated to like this character in order to enjoy the series.\"\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nI originally saw this anime and was really anticipating it probably more than anything else in the season. And as it started, I detracted on that position almost immediately. After the exhaustively obvious formula of who is going to die next was figured out, it wasn't really worth caring for any of the characters. Not in that it was a defense mechanism for me not to care, but because the anime didn't give me a reason to care. The anime just kills characters and hopes that you're sad at the concept of meaningless death as long as they toss in some crying friend or sappy flashbacks at the moment of death.\\n\\n\r\nThe most enjoyment I got out of it was laughing at how abrupt or sudden a death was. There's no actual reason to care for any of the characters because they never provided a reason to care, so attachment was out the window from the get-go. It was hard for me to look at this anime and even see the worldbuilding aspect of it because you can just see that the writer just wanted to showcase magical fights in a \"dark setting where hope is hard to find.\"\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is desperate for reaction. It tries everything it can to force reactions from the audience rather than letting the audience feel things by themselves, and in doing so, comes across as petty and undignified. It's nothing more than a disappointing cash-grab that has nothing to offer anyone in any form.",

Then I decided on a whim to choose this, and I don't regret it at all. There are two main reasons:\r\nThe first reason is.. a lot of types of mahou shoujos!yes, each with different ability. I thought that it would be interesting to see them battle each others. And it is executed very well I say. The battle scenes are not much, but they are pretty good. Sometimes they are not fight heads on buttrick each others, which is interesting to watch too.\\n\\n\r\nAnother reason is.. there are some plot twists in this anime. No, I'm not talking about how they'll die here. Anyone who see this anime will be able to conclude, which one will be dead next time after watching few episode, because the pattern is repeated. But there are some minor twists in the story that are unexpected, which make this show enjoyable to watch until the end. I bet you'll not be able to tell which one that will survive until the end, because some of them are not really stand out at the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nThere are another good things from this show, like the OP and ED. especially ED which is really suit the mood. some interesting psychological story telling, although not too deep. That is understandable considering the length of this anime is only 12 episode, and with so many characters too. Good thing that there are almost no useless fan service here. \\n\\n\r\nSo my final verdict is, you can enjoy this anime as simple fantasy action anime, don't expect too much on psychological aspect (go for madoka or even wixoss series for that). also, beware that there are gore and bloody scenes here, I think that's not for everyone to enjoy.",

In nearly 12 eps, Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku turned a unconvoluted premise convoluted, obtuse, unfocused, and just outright weird.\r\nThe entire core of Magical Girl Raising Project was inspired from Puella Magi Madoka Magica, a critically acclaimed gem from 2011 that received praise for subverting the magical girl genre. It really blows that one of the few if only merits of the series is inspired from another, arguably better series made several years ago. \r\nThe main content of Magical Girl Raising Project is watching Magical Girls perform brutal violence. The first fourepisodes had great pacing, shocking twist, and established the characters. Then it proceeded to drop the ball on every single plot point. Character motivations cease to make sense, the lack of logic becomes hard to ignore, and the one track mind homicidal maniacs ruin any sense of attachment that I had towards the series.\\n\\n\r\nMayoiga, another obtuse, but surprisingly good, anime shares some commonalities. They both have very brief cutscenes interjected clumsily episode after episode to provide backstories for the characters, and both shows are unintentionally funny at moments. While Mayoiga was bad, there were redeeming qualities. Magical Girl Raising Project is a trainwreck and not an entertaining one. Crucial characters will disappear for episodes\\n\r\non end and plot points that you think would have been resolved in prior episodes pop back up for seemingly no reason.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just to beat a dead horse. At the very least I could say that this show delivered something worthwhile thematically. Nope! not at all. Approach this show with caution because it is patience testing and a complete mess.",

            "content": "So, this series attempted to do something unique with the magical girl genre; turn it into a real battle royal.  However, in it's attempt to do that, it completely gutted itself and ruined any potential it had.\r\nI'll start with the good things.  The character designs were somewhat unique.  Despite feeling like some of the characters were blatant rip-offs of a certain other magical girl series, there were also several that had super unique abilities and how they used them were well designed.  Especially Swimswim, I liked her ability... even if at times it felt like they didn't quite stick to itfully.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation for the series was also above par.  I wouldn't say it was anything groundbreaking or specifically a reason why you should watch it, though.  The voice acting was also pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was... bearable.  For what it was worth, I didn't want to drop it expressly at any point, but that's probably because I quickly realized it wasn't going to have any potential and instead just let myself be pulled along for the ride.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that's about where the good points end.\\n\\n\r\nFor detractors, where do I start? How about the fact that they started with by far too many characters.  16?  Really?  Is that necessary?  If you need to end up chopping half of them out (or more), how are you going to give them any type of proper character development? You have 12 episodes, 16 characters... that's not even an episode worth of mild character development per character...\\n\\n\r\nDue to this, none of the characters get any solid character development.  Not even our \"main heroine\" who, tbh, isn't that main.  With the lack of development, this leaves you without any type of character connection or  relatability, so you have no reason to emphasize with the characters as they hit the chopping block.  On top of that, with the speed they do it, and lack of any backstory before they lose, you never get to the point of really wanting one to last till the end.  Yeah, they kind of steer you towards a few you don't want to see win, but you're more wanting to see them lose than care about others winning.\\n\\n\r\nSo remember how I said they don't get any real development before they lose?  That's the kicker, when they do lose, THAT is when they get a very small semblance of trying to build a backstory. Talk about bad story telling.  The writer obviously doesn't know wtf they're doing. Yes, attempt to give me a reason (poorly told ones at that) to like the character after they've ALREADY LOST!  What's the point in doing it now?\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing they tried to do, but didn't do too well at, was emphasize the shock factor. You could tell what happens to characters when they lose long before they \"revealed\" it. You also knew what the purpose of the whole thing was.  I mean, look at the title... (I might have used rearing instead of raising, personally, though).  There was no surprise.  The only surprising event was how early they removed the one chance they had of trying to make the viewer empathize with the main heroine (hint: EP6).\\n\\n\r\nNext, the shrinking of the number of \"winners\" they could have through out the series was horribly done.  There was little planning, little lead up, and no reasoning (other than our obvious end result reason) given. \"Oh, we just need to reduce the number\" is not a well written reason.  Come on, even I could give a more convincing reason than that and write it in a way that it didn't feel shoehorned in just as a story driver.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the one orchestrating all this, Fav, was a shitty antagonist, and another example of the author not knowing how to write a good story. It's importance entirely revolved around nothing more than to prod the girls.  It wasn't trying to stick to some moral high ground, or be actually evil... it couldn't commit to anything.  Too many times did it prod or give information it shouldn't have, only to then say that it's just a observer and shouldn't be influencing the events.\\n\\n\r\nFurther, the rabbits foot usage.  So, this for me was the crucifix that marked the series as poorly written and even more terribly executed.  There is a more appropriate, more emotional scene (for the MC that is, not for us) for it to have come into play than when it did (hint: EP10).  That is when this should have kicked in, considering it was there and there were far more emotions flying around from our MC.  But poor writing struck again, and it only ended up being used as a shallow (and poorly executed) plot driver.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all the story telling was pretty bad, to be honest.  So many things were written out of order, there was no character development, no shock & awe, no getting the viewer to feel invested in the characters or the story... and there was no satisfying ending. They never gave an any purpose as to why they were trying to \"raise them\". All they said was to find the strongest... but for what?  Why?  What good would it do for them? But I would say there was one good aspect to the story, and that was what I'll call the underdog factor when it came to which characters lasted the longest and earned the most... uh... wins.\\n\\n\r\nThe last detractor that I'll cover was, and this may be due to my personal like of the series, but how much it felt like it stole some of it's items from Madoka Magica.  Our \"main heroine\" feels very much like Madoka, who doesn't honestly do that much through out the series, and is instead attempted to be further driven into depression to have her be there at the end to make some final event happen.  Calamity Mary is, well, a partial rip-off of Mami.  Her fighting style and abilities are fairly similar and they both have unstable personalities. And then there's the Homura copy, who I won't say who she reminds me of (as that's spoiler I feel), but the character is your reclusive, kind of dark feeling, black hair, I'll do things my own way type of character.  Only thing missing is the backstory between the two (but again, this series doesn't have any of that anyway).  On top of that, we have a poor Kyubey rip off, Fav.  He's has a similar but different white design, is \"misunderstood\" (sort of), is alien to the story's world, and is there for some \"greater good\".  Come on... if you're going to try this, at least make the core set of characters look different!\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nSo all in all, the series is decent if all you want is a battle royal with magical girls, but if you're looking for anything beyond that, you're in for a massive disappointment, and I'll tell you you're better off looking other series (may I suggest Mirai Nikki or Akame ga Kill).",

            "content": "Hello, I am here to deliver a review for Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku. I just watched episode twelve tonight.\r\nI am not that into \"magical girl\" anime, so I won't be very bias in my review.\r\n\u30e1 Story: The story is very good. I am judging the story on it's plot twists and fear factor. The first three episode are delivered as the entire anime was meant to continue to be calm, but friendship is fickle in this one. There is a lot of intensely edgy backstories and death that make this anime even more edgy. It's sad at points if you get easily attached to characterslike I do, otherwise you'll think it's a \"over-the-top edge-fest\".  \\n\\n\r\n\u30e1 Art:  The art of the anime was very good in terms of movement and shading. The style in some frames could have awkward movement at some times. The art style is different. It's cute like you would expect a magical girl anime to be, but the direction and the fact many scenes take place at night make it \"dark\". Hell, \"Nanbaka\" has more sparkles than this!\\n\\n\r\n\u30e1 Sound: The sound is very good. I always judge sound on how memorable it is. During the sad moments, there is this piano piece that plays and I can't forget it. The ending is good as well. It's like a cool-down song similar to Death Parade's ending theme. The opening is nice, but I wish they did alternate versions of the opening as more characters died or as the plot progressed (ex. Dangan Ronpa 3: Hope Arc).\\n\\n\r\n\u30e1 Characters: I think the characters are good. I am glad the characters are not all in a similar age range. Most of the characters have an edgy backstory and diverse living standards. To be honest, their are still common character tropes for some characters (but they are hard to avoid).\\n\\n\r\n\u30e1 Enjoyment: I enjoyed this anime. It's something I have never watched before (as I have avoided Madoka Magica). Snow White is a wimpy main character, and her uselessness can be annoying sometimes. Even so, if it weren't for that I am not sure if she would have \"changed\" at the end.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, if you enjoy having your heart ripped out, blood/gore, no friendship power and dark stories...this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nThank you.\\n\\n\r\n- PlumAppleJuice\\n\\n",

            "content": "The battle royale theme is no stranger to the anime medium, with many series incorporating it in their storyline from Mirai Nikki to the Fate Series just to name a few. The method of execution is what usually enamours the audience, which is a quintessential requirement for its overall success. Now can be it done with magical girls? The answer is a yes but the degree to which it is provides an entertaining storyline is variable. Anyone who is well versed with a last man standing format should have a complete grasp of the problems associated with it.\r\nThe conspicuous social experiment that enables a totalof 16 magical girls battling each other to the death sounds amusing at first. The chosen participants are selected on a purely random scale each with their fair share of problems to boot. It looked rosy at first with the magical girls conversing with each other in the common chat room, only to take a sinister turn moments later. The news of the passing of the friendliest magical girl instilled fear and worry which was only going to get worse from this point. A battle royale truly begins when the first participant dies and Nemurin was the catalyst for the violence and destruction that soon follows.\\n\\n\r\nThe rules for the social experiment need to be addressed as I find it to be a major concern of mine. The objective in the magical girl raising project is to avoid getting the least amount of magical candies which are obtained through honest good deeds that signifies one being a Samaritan. The reward for aiding the vulnerable populace is clear but to me becomes irrelevant for the magical girls. Why waste your time when you can simply kill other magical girls to fulfil the requirements of the game? This quota in place holds no significance for the murderers who have no qualms about ending another\u2019s life which include the public. It\u2019s either dying by having no magical candies or being murdered by another magical girl. This is such an ideal scenario for a devout pacifist\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe game-master who oversees the pandemonium Fav is a pure mystery at this point. This fluffy and shrewd AI thing that only appears through holograms (through the communication devices) is just incompetent in my eyes. The thing isn\u2019t even neutral like you expect him to be and is aligned with a certain magical girl in the social experiment.  Fav is unjust, there is no concise and clear instructions made despite having an initial rundown on the rules. During the experiment, Fav is always adjusting the rules which can be agitating in my eyes as a third-party spectator. For example, always reducing the total numbers of magical girls limit to better \u2018distribute\u2019 the magical candies. I\u2019ve explained it above and this shows you why it\u2019s just a simple killing game with no substance.\\n\\n\r\nThe level of violence and profanity is a tad bit excessive in my opinion, with the show presenting majority of conflicts as being gore-fests meant to shock the viewer in all means possible. Death plays a pivotal role in how the characters develop, with many of them being direct casualties thus I find it redundant that some mourn for their allies despite being informed of the consequences. What the series performs well in are the number of alliances that is evident between participants. The concepts of deceit and betrayal is magnificently done with certain plot twists arising because of that. The amount of backstabbing witnessed in this social experiment is a valid representation of human behaviour when dealing with a life or death situation. The idea of being pitted against one other is detrimental for one\u2019s frame of mind and this anime does a superb job at portraying the despair and bleakness.\\n\\n\r\nThis was also going to be a complaint of mine from the beginning and so you could do say that it was inevitable. Plot armour is deemed to be one of the most exhausted plot conveniences. If you have main characters such as Snow White and Ripple, it is only natural you expect them to make it till the end. The same rules apply to overpowered characters such as Cranberry and Swim Swim who display abilities that are overbearing compared to other magical girls. The survival of the fittest concept works wonders in a battle royale format considering it weeds out the weaker participants that die off first. This show could have been a great subversion if it tried to do things differently but instead we got the usual which is disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characterisation of the cast is a bit mind boggling at times. Every single magical girl is given flashbacks which I find to be quite lazy and uncreative. The show is being melodramatic when it presents the sad backstory of a girl/boy trying to evoke emotion out of me. Every character has similar unfortunate circumstances making it difficult to differentiate characters based on prior experiences. The only one I can think of would be Top Speed who had a relatively normal backstory, she is not a deranged individual and exhibits qualities that of a kind and endearing person. The only dynamic characters I find even remotely interesting are Ripple and Swim Swim who\u2019ve had various setbacks and proactively learn from them.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by studio Lerche (Assassination Classroom, Gakkougurashi!) is well produced and there isn\u2019t anything being sub-par in quality. The action scenes which are frantic and erratic are well produced and goes hand in hand with the colouring scheme which just adds to my immersion. The art style which includes the character designs is generally pleasant. The designs for the magical girls are very cute and adorable (would be a discredit to lolis) which is synonymous with the sub-genre. Each character was given a unique selling point making it easy to recognise them instantaneously. \\n\\n\r\nThe music composition is done by Iga Takurou who is a relative newcomer with hardly any titles worth mentioning. The opening was standard for a show but the ending was fantastic listening to repeatedly as it complemented the background scenery. The insert music used within the show usually only manifested itself in the intense scenes, where events leading to deaths were made better through careful track selection. There were plenty of occasions in which individual piano scores were used during somewhat miserable scenes which I found was appropriate. The music is not the selling point of the show as other aspects such as animation are much better.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not really impressed with anything apart from the animation and art style which are top notch for its setting. The plot however is kind of forgettable and certainly needs to be revised to give a better experience. This is adapted from a light novel, so you may check that out if this series is to your liking. The lack of clarity with the game rules is probably its downfall which is a shame as it had much more to offer.",

I was looking for a dark magical girl anime and came across this!\r\nI would recommend but of course like most animes it has flaws.\r\n{Story 8/10}\r\nThe story was good, I liked how it was different to Madoka Magica, but it still carried the dark magical girl aspect. The story was sad and I really wanted to kill Fav, freaking fav. But it was a bit quick at the start. All of a sudden she was a magical girl, then it turned into the hunger games in less than 2 episodes. If they had an extra episode showing us different good deeds and how themagical girls get along it would have added a lot to the anime.\\n\\n\r\n{Art 9/10}\\n\r\nThe art was amazing! The character designs were so cute and unique. The style wasn't messy or sketchy, and very clean. The animation scenes were very realistic too. Like when La Pucelle was thrown face first into concrete, instead of having- I don't know- a scratch, her face was covered in blood like it should have been.\\n\\n\r\n{Sound 9/10}\\n\r\nThe sound was good quality, and the voice actors portrayed the characters really well. You could hear the emotions and distress from the characters and it was good. :>\\n\\n\r\n{Characters 8/10}\\n\r\nThe anime was a little rushed so getting connected to the characters at the start was a bit hard. But I must admit I cried at like 5 deaths. (La Pucelle, Top speed, Sister nana, Hardgore Alice, and Tama) \\n\r\nBut the main character, Snow White, was the typical useless optimistic protagonist and frankly kind of annoyed me. \\n\\n\r\n{Enjoyment 8/10}\\n\r\nI truely enjoyed the anime, and I've watched it 3 times. Each time making me love it more! \\n\\n\r\n{Overall 8/10}\\n\r\nGood anime! One of my favourite, and would recommend. :3",

Character development is all rushed and last minute to the point where it's kind of insulting that we're supposed to care about the characters at all. The weakest character happens to be our protagonist, who hardly gets any screen time and doesn't develop very much at all throughout most of the season. Then again, she's the only character who reacts to her circumstances like a real person. Everyone else just kind of hopped on board the death and murder train the second they foundout about it. The character designs are kinda wonky. It the classic anime problem of having eyes too big, set too far apart with no nose to speak of with the added dimension that you really can't tell how old anyone is really supposed to be. Everyone looks either 5, 15, or 25 and the only real difference between the three is their relative heights. The story beats are kind of tired and uninspired. I feel like this anime was shooting for Madoka Magica but missed and landed entirely in schlock-land. But hey, if you just want to see a bunch of girls kill each other, this is good enough. It was fair enough for me to watch the whole thing at least.",

            "content": "Do you like poorly written stories with little bit of complexity, horrible characters and a plot that will make you say \"mm, that's ok, i guess\" ? Well, Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku might be for you.  Yes, it's a Hunger Games with Magical Girls.  Excuse me if my review seems like a spoiler, but it isn't.  This anime is so poorly written that is predictable.  \r\nStory 3/10\r\nWhat happens when an anime based on a game doesn't follow its own rules? Well, this happens. I will quote Danganronpa.  Danganronpa was a killing game that had precise rules: they will apply toanyone and they will be followed no matter what.  This anime doesn't do this.  At first, they tell you they need to cut the magical girls to 8, then they tell you you can buy magical items to get an advantage, then they tell you that they have to modify the rules yet again so the plot keeps going.  This is totally dumb and unimaginative.  Instead of the girls trying to figure out how to avoid getting killed by following the rules, they are forced to do stupid things like buying magical items.  \\n\\n\r\nThen I must tell you this is heavily rushed.  At first i felt the pacing was just right, but then we get 4 deaths in an episode.  That means 12 minutes of flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nBut the greatest sin of this anime is letting you know who is going to die just before they do.  I feel like watching Akame ga Kill, when someone is about to die, they just show you a flashback of how this magical girl got her powers.  And even after all this senseless slaughter, it was completely predictable who was going to win.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\\n\r\nPathetic.  Characters are pathetic.  We have Snow White, she doesn't do anything at all except crying while everyone wants to protect her for some reason.  People tell me not to compare her to Madoka, well, she's Madoka, except she doesn't do anything at all in the end.  Then we have Ripple and Hardgore Alice which admire Snow White for some reason, in a Homura way, I guess.  The cast is divided in 2: bad magical girls and good magical girls that protect Snow White.  Fav is a Monokuma-Kyubei clone and it's dumb.  Also, all of the cast get like 3 minutes of development prior to her deaths.  I'm sorry, but this is not how you write a character.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't even remember the ending because I skipped it, generic.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe designs were good, I must admit.  But I hate the placement.  They all fight in the city at night, and they don't do anything else.  Most of the fights develop in a building's ceiling.  Cool, I guess.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\\n\r\nDecent entertainment because you are trying to figure out who is going to get killled next...then the death flag appears.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is a poor anime.  Bad story, bad writing, terrible characters.  Even the fans of gore will likely find amusement in another story.  Please avoid it at all costs.",

            "content": "Preface:\r\nSince quoting philosophers out of context and completely out of place is the bread and butter for each and every self-proclaimed ANIME EXPERT amongst MAL reviewers out there, I figured I might as well kick this one off just like that.\r\nWith that said, Immanuel Kant once used to say \"blablabla and then some more, Top Speed/Winterprison/Hardgore Alice BEST GIRL\" and just like that or perhaps even not, most people simply Madokan't believe it whenever there's a new dark magical girl anime since let's be really, really honest: There's only so much you can deconstruct and when, back in the days, Urobuchi Gen invented magic, sufferingand, of course, girls, we all knew the cheap copycats would want to have a piece of the cake as well.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I think stiff Madokants shouldn't really lose their heads over there being other things right next to their favorite title but what do I even know.\\n\\n\r\nIn more recent news, the review itself features spoilers yet no scores and also doesn't mention Madoka since I figured that'd be for the better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWriting:\\n\r\nYou know, I'm really glad about what MahoIku isn't: This could have gone down the Akuma no Riddle or Mirai Nikki route of one cannon fodder after another challenging only the really boring protagonists and getting offscreened as a result but I'm really glad it didn't and achieved what these two couldn't: Bringing to life a rather diverse, colorful cast of characters where you're actually inclined to pick your many favorites.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to this essentially being another Battle Royale-esque story following the very primitive principle of getting you to like a few characters and then taking them away from your clutches because now that's how you get an emotional reaction from your audience. It admittedly lacks any sort of grace, yes, but if executed well, can work some wonders. Does MahoIku achieve that though? Actually, yes, mostly.\\n\\n\r\nThere is reason for me to believe that the author is really, really clever, namely him bringing his A game to the table with conceptually smart ideas as far as the characters are concerned:\\n\\n\r\n- Ruler is among the hardworking elite on paper except life played her a different card and now she's stuck with making coffee and given her superior, one can't fault her too much for probably thinking she's the smartest person in the room. This, of course, leads to an inferiority complex and the strong desire to boss other people around, something her power does for her except it's specific enough for her to need help by other people. Ironically, several of her servants would argue she doesn't behave any different from her actual boss (which I'd disagree with but oh well) and what causes her undoing is one of her subjects taking her orders too seriously at any given point of time.\\n\r\n- Cranberry, on paper and in practice, is the strongest character around but due to her own tunnel vision of only seeking the strong, doesn't really accomplish any of her goals and gets killed by Tama, the weakest character who only ever strolled along.\\n\r\n- Winterprison comes across as someone not very good at socializing apart from interacting with her lover Sister Nana, who, very much on the opposite end, takes socializing to the point where she genuinely believes that making friends in a death game would be the best way to go which goes down as badly as you'd expect, with Winterprison sacrificing her own life to ensure Nana's survival who, however, couldn't live without Winterprison and chooses suicide instead. This was generally really well done as their romance was quite possibly the most genuine, heartfelt one I've seen in 2016 and the characters had all the necessary build up for their conclusion to be quite a blow to the stomach.\\n\r\n- Hardgore Alice is brilliant insofar as that everything from the first time she gets mentioned screams \"Surely she's a villain!\": She's the mysterious sixteenth person thrown into a death game, has an unhealthy obsession for the protagonist, kills someone in cold blood the moment she meets her, has the cloth of a dark goth girl and her name contains \"Hardgore\", albeit only because her powers lead to her getting turned to mincemeat but how were we supposed to know? The audience is with Snow White insofar as that almost everything revolving around Alice leads up to misinterpretation (fun fact: in the fanbook, she gets five stars for \"Wrong First Impression\") until you really get to know her and she's about the nicest girl in the universe. Her power also matches her greatly as in that he always wanted to die before meeting Snow White, yet can't in magical girl form, only to die in human form after finding hope for herself.\\n\r\n- Calamity Mary, someone who's never been up to any good as someone who divorced her husband and hit her child, gets a companian through Magicaloid, who's a homeless teenage girl with no parents around. The writing sadly doesn't really do much with that but it's a cool thing on paper at least.\\n\r\n- The family theme goes on with Ripple, someone who had a genuinely terrible family life, moved out and is now going through some hard times and Top Speed, someone who used to be a troublemaker in the past and can therefore relate to Ripple and wants her to change accordingly just like herself, now a soon-to-be (or not) loving mother. While Ripple's growth feels somewhat artificial (as she only really warms up a few second before Top Speed's death), it's generally neatly done.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, MahoIku really doesn't go by the numbers but at the same time, also doesn't construct and kill off its characters without rhyme or reason. Needless to say, being able to actually care about these characters is a good thing for an anime like this. Its setup is primitive in nature but that gets saved by the capable execution.\\n\\n\r\nAntagonist-wise, MahoIku plays some genuinely interesting cards as well yet overall leaves behind a bit of a lacking aftertaste though:\\n\r\n- First we have Calamity Mary who fares really well - you're not supposed to like her but she manages to impress nonetheless. Her fight against Hardgore Alice is the smartest in the series and she gets incredibly thorough with it. She's clearly established as a strong threat from the very beginning on but is also level-headed to a certain degree or else she wouldn't have accepted Magicaloid or played GTA: Real Life Edition to get Top Speed and Ripple back on track. There's a bit of a system to her madness and that's a good thing. With all that said though, her getting offed by ninja stars just like that was quite a low point of the show.\\n\r\n- Cranberry initially succeeds as the character we know nothing about other than her being a whole lot of trouble but her involvement with the other characters is so non-existent, it sure makes one wonder. She was passive enough with Winterprison to not get anything out of it, never even considered fighting Mary and her faux backstory gave us nothing on her before she left this world behind.\\n\r\n- Swim Swim is a fascinating concept taken to the logical extreme and established a coup d'etat we didn't really see coming but she gets stale after a while. She admittedly got some really good killings out of the show but practically offed six characters with the motivation of \"That one dead character once said this and that\". She's an unconventional villain no doubt but at some point, was only there to kill your favorite character (she got all three of mine, so there's that) and that felt rather lacklustre. It also severely limits the variancy among match-ups which became noticable every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I'd still like to applaud MahoIku for being generally unconventional with its figures as that's a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nAs MahoIku also features a good chunk of action, I'd also like to mention that one's writing at least once as it positively stands out most of the time. Admittedly, there are some fights that felt like a grind (Mary vs Ripple) but in general, there is some creative use of tactics and gimmicks. A four on one battle such as with Winterprison is supposed to feel like a mess and with walls popping out of nowhere, someone's skull getting crushed (now THAT was satisfying to watch), the entire floor collapsing and an arm getting severed, MahoIku gets the job done. I've also mentioned Mary vs Alice before and that one really should drive the point home that action certainly isn't one of MahoIku's weaknesses luckily.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhich isn't to say that MahoIku is perfect and I do have a few issues with it:\\n\r\nThe first two episodes deliver on a really ungood package. Starting out the show with sixteen minutes of that one really bland protagonist who's obsessed with magical girls wouldn't sit well with anyone and even at the end of episode 02, all the anime had delivered on was that one twist we all saw coming. In general, these episodes' biggest weakness is that they are very heavy on Snow White and she is really boring, she's the protagonist but refuses to be part of her own show to the point of being the least influential character around and while everyone was busy thinking and doing things, she just kind of moped around until the end of the show and that's it. I suppose it was for the better since her eating up screentime would have been disastrous due to how bland she was but I can't really say \"Way to go, protagonist, you were a vital and interesting element to the show!\". The less said about her the better.\\n\\n\r\nSome deaths towards the end also were all sorts of crammed in and felt like they just had to be there to write characters out of the show: I've already mentioned Mary's and Cranberry's above so let's move past that but Top Speed's wasn't particularly stellar either. It had the element of surprise on its side but it was hard to get emotionally invested, as what followed was a really badly done battle with no conclusion, stretching the distance between the audience and Top Speed's death, leading to little more than Ripple staring in shock at Top Speed's corpse. Admittedly, the two of them got fantastic closure in episode 11 but the death itself was lacklustre to say the least. On that note, Swim Swim killing off Top Speed due to a surprise attack made little sense as it would have been smarter to get rid of Ripple first and Top Speed being good friends with Ruler really didn't go anywhere in regards to that. Going back to episode 03 and seeing Top Speed offer Swim Swim a ride, saying \"We're going to be good friends!\" is hilariously ironic though.\\n\r\nAlice's death was also rather dumb as \"I can't focus to transform back into a magical girl\" was a really cheap excuse and while her flashback story started out promising, it really didn't go into the specifics or felt well-rounded, not to mention Snow White picking up her missing keys back in the beginning didn't quite carry as much weight as it should have and I felt all of that was really shallow and a disservice to her character.\\n\r\nAnd then there's Sister Nana, someone who really should have kicked the bucket at the end of her own episode. With that said, these are five out of twelve deaths so you do the maths.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also the issue of flashback stories being shoehorned in right before a character dies, making the flow of events really predictable. Frequently, the flashbacks themselves are effective at what they set out to do but the anime hardly gets to wow you over that one death you didn't see coming (there are some flashbacks not set right before the crucial moment though, take Mary's, Top Speed's or Tama's).\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, Ripple and Snow White surviving was a rather foreseeable conclusion and while I think that MahoIku ending on a human coming of age note (Ripple having both a scar and Top Speed's cloak was neat symbolism and a reminder for her growth), it's still a bit of a shame we barely got any backgrounds on why any of this took place to begin with. Something less abstract than a vague two minutes infodump from Fav would have been preferable but oh well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAudiovisual Execution:\\n\r\nHey, guys, it's Lerche! Rings any bells? No? Well, let me name a bit of their TV output: P4, DeSu 2, Dangan Ronpa, MajiKoi, the Hamatora sequel and you're slowly but surely getting the gist that these guys are a small studio frequently running into production problems and while there have been laudable exceptions (hearsay has it Gakkou Gurashi is one of them, MonMusu had the Arve Rezzle/Muromi-san sakuga backing and Ranpo Kitan, while hardly outstandingly produced, was Kishi working stage play-esque wonders for the direction by not being directly involved with a single episode, don't ask me how that works), MahoIku unfortunately doesn't fall into the category of better looking anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is not to say that it looks disastrous but occasionally, things do get really ugly, especially Ripple's first fight against Swim Swim which looked like shit and was insanely hard to follow and that's not a good thing. As far as battles in general are concerned, you're hardly in for any sakuga miracles and I can't recall a single one that was genuinely well-animated but for what it's worth, the action animation is passable. Not much to see there but hardly a collection of poorly put together stills and speedlines either. Every now and then, the anime even does bring some nice imagery to the table, take La Pucelle's/Snow White's rooftop scene or Top Speed and Ripple having their final goodbye and rarely, there's a bit more of slight stylization with its art going on but with all that said and done, you really are not watching this for the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nFor what little can be said about it, the soundtrack is rather nice actually. There's hardly a standout piece that would come to your mind thinking of MahoIku's scoring but I've kept a note in the back of my head to check out its OST upon its release as several of the darker/more urgent themes struck quite a tune with me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBottom Line:\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I feel like there's a lot I really, really like about this one but also some stuff that's kind of a downer. I just really do think that a better execution at times could have really saved the day but time constraints are a thing so most of it was probably hard to avoid.\\n\\n\r\nSo yes, I do have my fair share of gripes with this anime as I think there are just too many flaws to get to an area where the really good stuff assembles but hey, at the end of the day, this is still among the best output in 2016 and this franchise has won me over to the point of getting to its source. Something that can't be said for most of the seasonal output out there.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI was raised in a good home, a loving home.\r\nI had my wants and my needs like any other kid, but, looking back on what my parents provided me, there\u2019s absolutely no way I could complain about my upbringing. The family get-togethers. Trips to the ice-cream parlor and the video-game store. Support in my endeavors, schooling, and milestones. I don\u2019t tell my father and my mother every day, but I thank them, with all my heart, for giving me a childhood that led me to a worthwhile adulthood.\r\nTruth be told, my parents never did raiseme as a magical girl. And, after watching Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku, I\u2019m gladder than ever that they didn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nIkusei Keikaku follows Koyuki Himekawa, a sweet middle-school girl who dreams of becoming one of the very magical girls that she so often fantasizes about. To her surprise, the mobile-phone game she was playing grants her wish, giving her the chance to help as many people as she can. However, something sinister lurks in the nearby shadows.\\n\\n\r\nThose shadows are light at first. New rules are enforced where the lowest-candy-getting girl of the week loses her magic. Then the shadows get darker when the loser has a coincidental heart attack in her sleep. And they get at their darkest (and stay this way) after the girls escalate their plans to thievery, violence, and eventually straight-up murder.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of Ikusei Keikaku\u2019s content is quite demented. For example, Cranberry forces La Pucelle to walk out into oncoming traffic, mangling his body so profusely that his parents couldn\u2019t even provide an open casket at his funeral. Some of it is morbid, like when Sister Nana commits suicide by hanging herself with her beloved Winter Prison\u2019s scarf (which she received from Sister Nana) following her death. But no matter the case, each encounter is inhumane in some way.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s the biggest reason (arguably the only reason) to watch Ikusei Keikau: witness a bunch of cute girls eviscerate each other in cruel ways. Smashing their heads, slicing their necks, and burning their disintegrated bodies are just a few of the actions made by the girls and women as they go about attacking one another. It gets a little strange when the audience is reminded that half the \u201ccandidates\u201d are in middle school or younger, but this contrast between the innocent portrayals and the brutal betrayals makes for an entertaining time.\\n\\n\r\nOddly, some of the deaths and kills are anticlimactic, or, at the minimum, they occur in a way or at a time that doesn\u2019t seem like the best point to off the cast. Calamity Mary is a wildcard psychopath, but she dies to just one of Ripple\u2019s shuriken. Cranberry, despite reigning as the mastermind behind the whole murder-fest and being the (in some sense) final boss, has the top half of her body completely obliterated by Tama in a sudden turn of events. These two are the most extreme examples in terms of oddness, but many of the magical girls, once death is imminent, find themselves out of the match per se.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, these unexpected outcomes are a positive. Not only do they keep audience members on their toes as they watch the story play out, but also these outcomes give Ikusei Keikaku a realistic edge. The anime doesn\u2019t setup any unfair scenarios based on the contexts created, simply removing the next unfortunate soul in the plot\u2019s path.\\n\\n\r\nLooking more closely at the narrative structure of the anime, though, it\u2019s about as pretty as Ruler\u2019s bloodied corpse.\\n\\n\r\nThe show sometimes tries way too hard at appealing to the audience\u2019s emotions for many of its revelations. Top Speed was more than three months pregnant when she was killed by Swim Swim. Indicated by her holding her bigger belly in her death pose and dropping her maternal notebook on the ground next to her. And Ripple\u2019s new \u201cdad,\u201d courtesy of her lascivious mother, is so beyond creepy that it\u2019s a miracle he has been able to hide his sick behavior his whole life.\\n\\n\r\nThese scenes are meant to influence the audience, get them understanding bluntly the messed-up world a lot of these girls come from and the untimely deaths they experience. Instead, they only deliver a hefty case of the eyerolls.\\n\\n\r\nIkusei Keikau also falls prey to the depict-personal-backstory-right-before-it\u2019s-needed syndrome. Often times, it kicks in immediately before a character dies, like when Winter Prison remembers Sister Nana or when Tama explains her entire past (since she was intentionally a useless character up until her demise). Where the bluntness from before tries too hard, these last-second scenes don\u2019t try enough, making it hard to care for some of the proceedings since the anime likewise didn\u2019t seem to care about them to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a very lazy attempt at making the plot even more dire with the introduction of purchasable special items. Energy medicine and a rabbit\u2019s foot literally shave off years of the buyers\u2019 lifespans \u2013 but only supposedly because this life-shortening deal has no impact on the events therein.\\n\\n\r\nThese items even call into question whether the anime did enough with the girls\u2019 own powers. The invisibility cloak and the giant halberd are practically required to spice the events up because the show failed to have many of the characters interact with one another, and, subsequently, their abilities were not combined in intriguing ways.\\n\\n\r\nIkusei Keikaku does contain a couple of nice story beats. The girl that Snow White helps later comes back as Hardgore Alice, a magical girl. And Nemurin\u2019s death, despite being the first, isn\u2019t at all pointless since it is her words that (accidentally) spur Swim Swim to take over Ruler\u2019s role and (indirectly) cause most of the chaos.\\n\\n\r\nBut more pitfalls exist. The behind-the-scenes magical-girl society is barely touched on, and the show\u2019s shoddy attempts at exploring strength, idealism, goodness, and purpose are jammed into the plot without grace.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, if one is only looking for violence and nothing more, then the story delivers on that front. Otherwise, the narrative needed to earn a few more candies to come out unscathed.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nIkusei Keikaku puts a ton of stock into its character designs, demonstrating finesse and care in the looks they bring.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, Snow White\u2019s design is quite involved. She dons many muted colors \u2013 light pinks, whites, greys \u2013 that match her soft personality. The darker colors, like the brownish headband and the black scarf, starkly contrast with this softness, giving her design an aesthetically pleasing balance. Her frilly dress, her flowers, and her golden eyes not only up her cuteness levels but also contribute to her sense of innocence and purity and goodness.\\n\\n\r\nNot every design is as nuanced as Snow White\u2019s, but they bring their own flavor nonetheless. Yunaelle and Minaelle are twins, so their designs are nearly identical save for the mirroring, single wing they wear upon their backs. Tama, a dog in design, wears a spiked collar that dangles a bone. La Pucelle\u2019s blue-and-gold armor, antennae, and long dragon tail allude easily to her knightly nature while concealing her true gender.\\n\\n\r\nSimply the sheer variety of looks that are easily discernable at a glance is commendable. Ripple is a ninja. Top Speed is a witch. Calamity Mary is a cowboy. Magicaloid 44 is a robot. Sister Nana is a nun.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of the detail and the variety, their designs also often coincide with their abilities. Swim Swim dresses like a swimmer (one-piece bathing suit, goggles) for her phase-through-anything power, and Nemurin (clouds, pillows) invite sleepiness, and thus dreams, just by looking at her.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are arguably Ikusei Keikau\u2019s strongest trait, so it\u2019s unfortunate that the rest of the artistry misses the same appeal.\\n\\n\r\nThe constant nighttime period and refusal to move away from anywhere but the city and a couple of forests drag the locales towards blandness. Cinematography and shot composition don\u2019t try for anything fancy either, leaving many of the scenes wanting. At the minimum, the anime does show off as much of the violence as possible. Sister Nana\u2019s swinging feet, Cranberry\u2019s lower half falling limp, and Winter Prison\u2019s flying severed arm are enough to get the points across.\\n\\n\r\nAs for actual animation, the anime doesn\u2019t have many strong moments, but it doesn\u2019t have many weak moments either. Ripple jumps, Calamity Mary fires her sniper, Tama digs, Winter Prison summons her slabs, and La Pucelle swings her sword. None of the battles have sustained choreography due to the nature of their abilities and the quickness with which their duels end, but, given that no notable mistakes or lags were seen, the show remains consistent in quality throughout its run.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nIkusei Keikaku houses a large cast with over sixteen different magical girls struggling to survive.\\n\\n\r\nAnime with a lot of characters like this one inherently make it difficult for themselves to let everyone feel worthwhile in some form. Not that they all need to be, depending on the circumstances. But, given the fight-for-the-death-brawl format that Ikusei Keikaku crafts, each character is more or less as important as the next.\\n\\n\r\nTo this end, the anime deserves at least some credit. It manages to explore each magical girl (however slightly), providing their backstory or focusing on their development to some extent. Naturally, some receive more attention than others, but they each get something.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, several characters are given the bare minimum. The twins were college girls who not only did everything together but were practically identical (hence their twin status). Calamity Mary was a horrible mother and fervent alcoholic who drove away both her husband and young daughter. Magicaloid 44 was girl who always did what she wanted to do, including sharing meals with and talking to a kind homeless man beneath a bridge.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, that\u2019s not a whole lot to go off of for a character, and many of the characters receive about as much, meaning they simply aren\u2019t very interesting. But these snippets of their past keep them from being just another lifeless body.\\n\\n\r\nSome characters are given more, especially on a relationship basis. Ripple and Top Speed connect thanks to Top Speed empathizing with Ripple\u2019s behavior as well as doing what she can to look out for the troubled girl. Snow White leans on La Pucelle for support, the latter vowing to be her steadfast knight. Sister Nana and Winterprison are romantically involved.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, though, the best and most intriguing relationship exists between Swim Swim and Ruler. Ruler commanded her \u201cidiots\u201d with meanness and derision, but her wisdom was not unfounded. Swim Swim, like a watery sponge, absorbed everything that Ruler taught her to an unorthodox degree. Unfortunately for Ruler, Swim Swim (from Nemurin) got it in her head that she no longer wanted to be a \u201cliege\u201d but rather a full-fledged princess \u2013 just like Ruler. So, Swim Swim eliminated the very woman she idolized.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, Swim Swim may even go down as the best character of Ikusei Keikaku simply for being an unconventional villain. The plans she carries out almost always work, netting her (directly or otherwise) almost half the kills among the sixteen magical girls (Ruler, Winterprison, Top Speed, Sister Nana, Hardgore Alice, Cranberry, and Tama). She never does anything of her own thinking, instead relying on past words and remembered guidance from Ruler. And her potential psychopathy can be attributed to the fact that she\u2019s literally a kid (and the youngest magical girl among the group), turning her deranged delusions into \u201cmere\u201d childlike wonderment.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, another major character is likewise unconventional in her role. And, doubly likewise, she also deserves an analysis: Snow White.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically speaking, she\u2019s the outlier among the other characters. She wants to be a magical girl through and through, so she strives to be \u201cpure, righteous, and beautiful\u201d in all that she does. And she achieves just that. Aiding people as much as she can, she exemplifies what being a magical girl truly means, and, for her, she has finally accomplished her dream.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, once the conniving and killing gets underway, Snow White does next to nothing of merit.\\n\\n\r\nShe sits atop the radio tower too much. She has her candies stolen from her. She cries a lot after La Pucelle dies. She pushes Hardgore Alice away when she tries to get closer. She shows up way too late to the final duel between Ripple and Swim Swim. In a way, Snow White is less the main protagonist of this story and more the cute bystander who nobody seems to care about or listen to.\\n\\n\r\nIn context, though, that makes sense. After all, she herself cannot do much. She\u2019s a pacifist not only because her ability is almost solely for helping others but also because of the tenets she vies to uphold. And the demonizing events, the loss of her best friend, and the unbelievable reveals make her sadness and her lameness understandable.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, Snow White\u2019s passiveness was constructed to give her some of the only tangible development in the season. Come the end, she yells at Ripple to not listen to Fav, going against her own perfect persona. Plus, she ignores the admins of the magical girls by helping other districts without their consent, and she trains with Ripple, learning how to properly fight to protect those in the future to atone for the ones that she could not save before.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this development comes in the final few minutes of the last episode. And, given how she was sidelined for nearly the entire story, her transformation from wholly good to still-good-but-not-wholly-so isn\u2019t compelling let alone impactful. Still, like the other side characters and knowing the anime is more story-driven than character-driven, it\u2019s something.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other smaller moments and ideas at play. La Pucelle\u2019s fear when she is about to die at Cranberry\u2019s hands earns sympathy from the audience since it\u2019s one of the only times where someone acts or responds rationally. And the anime may even have something to say about what people \u201cdeserve.\u201d That is, nobody deserves anything. From broken families to failed expectations to wanting to start anew, the girls, like every human being, have a past. Pasts that are most likely not the same and that don\u2019t automatically give the girls special treatment. Evident in the anime killing off whichever characters it wants whenever it so chooses.\\n\\n\r\nThis last idea is not explored outright. However, it at least allows the characters\u2019 deaths to not be as in vain as they perhaps are, boosting the cast\u2019s execution to some extent.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nAlongside the character designs, Ikusei Keikaku\u2019s ending track stands out as a clear strength. It gives off a strange, almost unfitting optimistic feeling when considering what the show actually entails. The whispering and space-like sound-effects in the beginning start the track as peaceful, and, as the English lyrics interweave with the rising beat, the tone gradually shifts into that hopeful territory. Strong vocals carry the piece through to the end, leaving its listeners conflicted as they already know what has become of the girls therein.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the music sadly doesn\u2019t reach the same heights as the ED, but it deserves some credit. Listening to the opening track, it blares at first, gives way to a soft, acoustic segment, and finally transitions into violins and vocals that match the intensity of the anime itself. As for the other soundtracks, the anime uses a mixture of techno, light piano, and grating sounds. These instrumental choices help with giving the battles more pop, supporting the more bittersweet scenes, and creating the spooky, foreboding ambience that directs the content (respectively).\\n\\n\r\nAnd for the voice-acting performance, only Kurumi Mamiya as Fav provided anything notable. The cute, digital overseer of the magical girls seemed to always have left over pep to share as well as a \u201cpon\u201d or two lying about.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest issue with this one comes from the simple fact that I don\u2019t care about almost all the characters.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of that comes from the lack of info or attention given to them. Nemurin and Cranberry come to mind in this category. It also comes from general unlikability. The twins Yunaelle and Minaelle were always too mean, Calamity Mary was too over-the-top, and Magicaloid 44 was too untruthful in her dealings.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, I didn\u2019t mind Ruler despite both of the above points. She at least looked out for her subordinates because, as she similarly phrased, a leader is nothing without her followers. Ripple, too. She was a bit disgruntled all the time, but her constant \u201cTch!\u201d remarks and drive to avenge Top Speed made her all right in my books.\\n\\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, I was more a fan of the nicer girls. Top Speed for her easygoing attitude and motherly instincts. Sister Nana for her absolute kindness. Tama for her innocent behavior and spare comedic relief. La Pucelle for protection of Snow White, and Snow white herself for being the only true magical girl. Again, they weren\u2019t outstanding in my eyes, but they at least prevented me from outright disliking the entire cast.\\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, the violence was entertaining. It\u2019s no doubt demented, but watching Ripple stab Swim Swim\u2019s corpse a few times too many and seeing Winterprison smash Yunaelle\u2019s head into a concrete wall had me laughing at the gratuitous gore and guts.\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku brings magic and blood, but this occult combo doesn\u2019t summon anything too worthwhile. The character designs are quite detailed, and the ED should be listened to more than once. Unfortunately, similar thoughts cannot be had for its story, characters, and the remainder of its content. If only it was raised by loving parents.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, the dichotomy of cute girls murdering one another is a spectacle, but the obvious appeals at emotion, the lazy writing, and the lack of further substance leave the narrative bruised and bloodied\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, involved character designs are a definitive strength, but artistry and actual animation does not go for anything interesting let alone fancy\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, everyone was given at least something, and both Swim Swim and Snow White were unconventional in their roles\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, uninteresting characters all around, but the violence was eye-catching on occasion\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

I would consider Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku to be darker than Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magical. Magical girls actively try to kill each other for their own sake. It is a very good anime with lots of blood. There is one big downfall to this anime. The protagonist. Each magical girl has their own segment in the show. Most of them do something important. What does the main character do? Absolutely nothing. Besides making strong friendships with two magical girls, saving civilians, and racking upthe highest amount of candy in the shortest time, she does nothing. She doesn't ask for peace or ever defends herself. She didn't even defeat one antagonist. She does nothing and the should have made her more pro-peace or have her fight. The only time she was significant was at the very end. Ripple would have made a better protagonist. Each magical girl has their own unique backstory and besides the protagonist doing nothing this is a great anime.",

It may be flawed, but it's not terrible, and I ate it up like candy.\r\nStory - 6\r\nThis show's story is a creative mix of familiar elements. Individually, I wouldn't call anything in the setup particularly groundbreaking, but as a whole it's interesting. There are lots of fun, edgy twists that vary greatly in the quality of execution. Seeing what would happen next was actually quite exciting. There are definitely plotholes and some deus ex machina instances but overall the plot is passable (barely)\r\nCharacters - 4\r\nQuick math: 12 episodes+ 16 characters + battle royale premise = underdeveloped characters (lots). It got to a point where if an episode started with a backstory, I was just like \"Well, I know who's dying today!\" You really don't care about them when they die, even if they get a little growth (right before dying). The only character whose death sparked even a little emotion from me was Ako/Hardgore Alice, and I'm pretty sure they were just trying to make you feel sad.  I should probably mention the main character. Koyuki Himekawa is sort of the protagonist, though she only feels like it in the first and last episodes. How she managed to survive can only be chalked up to plot armor; the focus switches a lot. Even though I love the do-good magical girl protagonist archetype to death, Snow White is forgettable. I actually wanted some of the magical girls to die, Calamity Mary standing out in that regard. This show's bggest issue is definitely the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 8\\n\r\nThis show actually looks great. Nice job as usual, Lerche. I remember the OST being good too, especially that dramatic organ piece. The OP and ED were good as well, though I skipped them. No complaints in this regard; move along.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment - 10\\n\r\nOh man did I have fun with this one. If you have an afternoon to kill, binge this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nEven though it had issues, I didn't even care because it was so darn enjoyable. I don't see much rewatch value in it, but it's fine. I really had a good time watching this anime once I looked past it's flaws, but if you aren't like that, you may consider passing this one; I don't blame you.",

Not to mention that to build up for a characters death youneed them to develop first are that doesn't happen here. Speaking of characters, the main is boring and literally the plot could go on without them. Why not make Ripple the main or just anybody else. We go actually several episodes without even seeing her.

            "content": "So, I'll be honest with you, I was really hyped for this show. Sure, it was being done by a studio that isn't very well known, but the premise pulled me in. Studio Lerche also did a good job with  Magical girls fighting to the death. Sure, it probably wouldn't be a masterpiece, but at least it would give me what I expected. A good battle royale, kill-'em-all. Sadly, that wasn't really what I got. Instead I got a boring piece of trash.\r\n\tMagical Girl Raising Project is about 16 girls who all become magical girls because of this mobile game. What a bunch ofcasual gamer trash! They then have to compete among each other to survive. They compete by collecting magical candies that you get from helping people, although we never actually see these magical girls helping people. Kind of odd. They then turn to murdering each other, and the show forgets that the competition was about magical candies and helping people, not who can murder more people. Honestly, this side of the anime showed much more promise. Sadly, the show can't follow up on the potential and the disappointment was crushing. Despite this, there is one form of entertainment that the story brings to Raising Project. Laughing at how poorly executed it was.\\n\\n\r\n\tSo, I'll be honest with you, again, after my expectations were crushed just like my will to live, at least the fight scenes could be decent, and I could have not TOTALLY wasted my time on this show. To quote Donald Trump-sama, \"Wrong\". Besides the fact that each and every fight in this anime that is literally about fighting each other is bad, they are also weighed down b the fact that Raising Project crams all of a characters development in ONE EPISODE. Bravo! So, the structure for an episode where someone dies basically goes like this. 2 characters fight. 1 beats the other. Right before said defeated character dies, all of her development is crammed into that 1 episode. To be fair, some characters that die didn't get the privilege of Studio Lerche giving them any development at all.\\n\\n\r\n\tOk, so the protagonist probably doesn't deserve her own paragraph, but I don't know how to write so, eh. The protagonist of this instant classic (if you couldn't tell, that was sarcasm) is known as Snow White. As a protagonist, she fills many roles, like helping to move the pilot forward, like any good character. Unless you're a pussy and don't believe in murdering other people. Don't be a pussy like Snow White. She ultimately does nothing to advance the narrative, a horrible trait to have as protagonist. She is super whiny, which becomes a bore to watch after like, 1 second. So, yah, she sucks.\\n\\n\r\n[SPOILER ROUND]\\n\\n\r\n\tYah, this show sucks. I think I've established that. What I haven't established is some of the specifics of why this show sucks. Or basically, why the ending sucks. If you haven't seen the show, its best to skip this paragraph and go straight to my closing thoughts and scores. Let me just say, Magical Girl Raising Project was an interesting ride. It will most likely be one I remember for awhile, even if it is for the wrong reasons. I reached the end of the show, and there will only two girls left. Snow White (the whiny bitch), and Ripple (look at those tits!). One thing this show did well was character design. Ripple's design was always mediocre, but in the final scene, she actually looks badass. Of course, this scene takes place months after the events of Magical Girl Raising Project. Apparently, Ripple and Whiny Bitch have been helping people since Monokuma from Dangan Ronpa was destroyed. They fight, and the show ends at that. This is probably the best scene in the entire show, and is actually not half bad. It almost shows some synergy between the girls, and it is the nicest-looking scene in the show. The roller coaster ride is over, and it is now up to us, the community, to give our final judgement on the show.\\n\\n\r\n[CLOSING THOUGHTS]\\n\\n\r\n\tMagical Girl Raising Project was a clusterfuck that couldn't decide on what it really wanted to be. Did it want to deconstruct the genre, or be a simple battle royale? The character designs look nice, but I can't help feeling there wasn't one true vision behind them. Some look like big-titted hookers, while others look like traditional magical girls. Also, these are the most un-magical girl magical girls ever. Being one seems extremely lame. Wow, I get to jump around on buildings. And I also get to jump on buildings. And I guess murder people? If this show didn't call itself mahou shoujo, I would have never guessed. Slightly off-topic, but damn were there a lot of plot holes. Maybe not SAO-level plot holes, but still. Overall, this show was just kind of average. Nothing stands out as especially horrid, or good. Would I recommend it? Eh, probably not, unless you want to watch everything the Fall 2016 anime season and to offer.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nFavorite character: Ripple\\n\r\nFavorite episode: 12 (The show ends)\\n\r\nRecommendation level: Very low\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10",

            "content": "The idea of recruiting humans to a supernatural plane of existence is certainly nothing new.  The Bleach manga achieved popularity by sending Ichigo into the world of Shinigami, and Yu Yu Hakusho made its mark when Yusuke and co. became spirit detectives. Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku, of course, takes up this concept in the form of magical girls.\r\nI have not read the novels, but from my understanding, this short 12-episode series essentially amounts to one big prologue to several future arcs.  I am writing this on the final Saturday of its airing, and there are no indications of a second season.  Unlessthe BR sales skyrocket, we can safely assume that it only amounted to an advertisement for the light novels and manga.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, I think that's all the producers ever intended it to be.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people may feel lost among the info-dump in the early stages.  To keep things simple, Koyuki is our good-natured, pink-haired heroine that is chosen to be a magical girl against her will - but fully embraces her Snow White alias and the idea of helping people if it can give her a purpose.  The social game that she and the others play is a means to recruit candidates and determine their worth as magical girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot will seem all over the place and will likely alienate those who are looking for something more cohesive.  If it helps, there are several different alliances between magical girls.  It's up to the viewer to determine who's righteous and who's wicked, and whether or not they feel any sympathy for someone who \"drops out\".  Meanwhile, the \"candy\" system is a farce, and is immediately thrown in the garbage not long after being introduced.\\n\\n\r\nMagical items akin to real social games make some appearances to help maintain originality, but they feel forced and only serve to help dwindle the competition.  Going any further is entering spoiler territory, but let's just say that the Magical Girl Raising Project that we're watching for the first time is a twisted version of what it used to be.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe story is but an introduction to something much bigger, and can leave the viewer with a hallow feeling.  Regardless, Lerche is able to make up for it with visually appealing battle sequences.  The magical girl designs are also very creative, and not like your typical frilly outfits we usually see in the genre. It's a step in the right direction, and can help keep you distracted from the intertwining plots.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nThere's nothing really here to criticize either, as the sound effects and music are pretty standard.  For the sound FX, There are a variety of weapons, devices, and settings that help keep the viewer immersed in the scene.  The voice acting is more than passable, with veteran talent such as Kikuko Inoue providing a gung-ho performance as Calamity Mary.  The music is by and large forgettable, but nano's \"DREAMCATCHER\" during the ending theme is hauntingly good, and actually makes you feel like there's a light at the end of the tunnel as the credits scroll through all 16 magical girls.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\\n\r\nBesides Snow White, each magical girl has a background chapter at some point, but they are often rushed, and they do little to help us connect with them.  This is arguably one of the anime's most glaring weaknesses.  After all, it's difficult for something compelling to happen when you barely know any of the characters.  Even if you do find someone likeable, sticking it out to the end will likely be painful as the body count rises.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\\n\r\nFor all of its flaws, MGRP manages to keep things interesting all the way to the end. The meat of this series' entertainment is finding out who dies next, and who will ultimately prevail in a survival-of-the-fittest selection process.  Perhaps it's a case of \"so bad that it's good\", but I'll leave that up to the viewer to interpret.  For me at least, the outcome left me wanting more - as I intend to read the translated novels when they arrive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're not a fan of magical girls, I probably wouldn't recommend something like this to you.  It puts a violent spin on a popular genre and creates a s***-load of characters that can be cosplayed at anime conventions.  It's entertaining enough for a general audience, but a vast majority will not likely follow the anime's intended purpose of promoting the source material.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll just put this here: I've only recently just gotten into anime. I don't know all the typical jargon and what have you, so I'll just give an honest review as I can.\r\nWARNING!!! AHEAD THERE BE SPOILERS AND I'M UNSURE HOW TO TAG IT!!!\r\n[spoiler]\r\nThe story could have been better and I'd have rated it higher if they had just allowed the characters stories to flow naturally. Instead what you have is a story that had great potential crammed into 12 short episodes. And it simply wasn't enough. While the whole idea of the story intrigued me (what isn't intriguing about a virtual world and itseffects on real life?) the reality that I was given left me feeling bitter.\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to fall into the same misogynistic feelings thrown at Snow White and I understood WHY she wasn't involved in the bloodbath it all led to, yet I still felt zero remorse for what happened to her. I just didn't care? Characters like Top Speed, Ruler, Sister Nana, etc were all painted as victims in their real lives, some way or another. Snow White doesn't have the same background as either and yet her survival whilst the others died just seems so...ugh. It's hard to describe. It feels as though they were meant to die in the first place because of their use of physical strength versus Snow White's lack of physical strength. It felt wrong to me and to be frank, I felt that the 'main' protagonist should have been Ripple and Snow White to not even be included. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of it just felt very rushed and in the end, predictable. The characters who were to die would get their back story in a few, simple flashes and that would be it. It left me feeling hollow and not in a good way. Like many have said on here already, the anime gave me something to do and it quenched my thirst to watch something but it didn't do much else. Characters were pushed aside for a plot that could barely keep itself together and it just wasn't as good as I expected it to be.\\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say the whole of it was bad, because it truly wasn't. The opening intro was fairly good (if somewhat spoilery) and I enjoyed the ending too. Again I say that the story, what little there was, wasn't awful and it definitely had potential. There was perhaps just too many characters to balance in the format that it was and it made some character's deaths feel overly cheap and unsatisfactory to watch. There were characters like Top Speed who I felt was really well done up until the moment of her death, which just left questions unanswered and not in a good way.  The gore and suspense that was there kept me wanting to know more, but after the ending it just felt like a cop-out. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, the potential of the series is what made it enjoyable to me, but was also what made it irritatingly disappointing too. \\n\\n\\n\r\n[/spoiler]",

            "content": "Ah, Magical girl raising project ( MGRP ). \"Entertaining, but forgettable.\" is the best way to quickly describe this anime.\r\nThere are quite a few things people miss about this show, and I am writing this review to stress that enjoyment of MGRP requires an open mind. Don't make the mistake of trying to compare MGRP to other \"Dark Mahou Shoujo\" titles like Madoka or Yuuki Yuuna, because MGRP isn't really similar to either of them. If anything, this show is more like western literature and bares extreme similarities to novels such as The Hunger games or even Maze runner. Calling MGRP \"Hunger Games with magicalgirls\" wouldn't be that far off and you could even stop reading all the reviews here and decide whether or not to watch this show on that note alone, so I will write the rest of this review on a pro/con mindset.\\n\\n\r\n-=Things the show does wrong / CONS=-\\n\r\n The characters themselves aren't all fleshed out into good enough detail. It did an OK job with what it had, but when you have a ton of characters in a 12 episode show it's not easy to give each of them enough spotlight to care about them. MGRP certainly tries, and succeeds with a few characters, but with the majority of them you really feel nothing when they die because the show didn't do enough with them. Sometimes you will find yourself thinking \"Oh not her! I Liked her!\" and other times you will be \"Oh she died. Literally who?\" \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with the show is the order in which the characters die works against the pacing of the story. Some of the poorly designed characters should have died sooner, while some of the better characters should have been more drawn out and killed later to make for a more climactic ending. Instead MGRP tries to go a more random route with some of the most boring characters of all managing to survive for far longer than their due date. While this makes the story more \"realistic\", realistic doesn't always mean good and this is one of those cases where it certainly does not. While the overall story is decent, they could have made the plot FAR more emotionally involved and FAR more interesting if they developed some of the girls better and made their interactions less predictable. In this sense, MGRPs biggest con is that it is wasted potential. This anime could have easily been topping the charts with just slightly better writing.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-=Things the show does right / PROS=-\\n\r\n For all its troubles, this anime actually does have a coherent plot. And if you pay attention to the details in between all the blood and guts, you will notice it also surprisingly has decent world building when you piece the puzzles together. This is the part where I believe a lot of people miss out on enjoying the show, because the answers to the questions the show raises are there but subtle. For instance, hints are dropped all over the show about the magical society behind the scenes. Without spoiling anything, this mage society here in fact operates very similar to the magicians society of Type Moon fanfare. Calculating and efficient, but ultimately cold blooded and unsympathetic towards the plight of non-mages. Once you understand it, you will find it all fits together quite nicely and requires a lot less suspension of disbelief than the average installment to the Mahou Shoujo genre. Again, it does require you to actually pay attention to the parts that at first might seem boring, but it's worth it.   \\n\\n\r\nThe final good note of MGRP is that it goes all in on the dark theme. Often times shows try to be dark and edgy but they wuss out on the blood and guts in order to try and appease a broader audience. MGRP doesn't do this and deserves respect for being front about it. Limbs will fly, heads will get chopped off, and pools of blood will be all over your screen. It's good mindless humor so if you are a fan of that kind of thing this show is definitely worth a watch. \\n",

            "content": "It's an okay Madoka wanna be, not even close to that quality tho, but still entertaining.\r\nTo describe it quickly, it's a death battle between magical girl, and some of them fall in despair.\r\nTo start with the qualities: \r\n- It's fun, if you're in the mood for some gore, psycho and murder, it's a good one.\r\n- The combat are cool and some of them have good strategy\r\n- and surprisingly the best part of the serie, the characters they're all unique with interesting motive and backstory. The power they're given are also cool none of them being boring and team work play a huge role in alot of fight.\\n\\n\r\nNow on the problem there's a number of them but most are rather minor, like the fact that the goal of the whole project stay rather undefined. The real problems can be sum up in 2 points:\\n\r\n- The MC, remember when i said that all the characters are good? (if you don't stop reading that and go see a doctor) Well i was lying, the MC is the exception. Her and her power are boring, she doesn\u2019t do much and even as the clich\u00e9 good hopefull girl we aready have a better character. She could be cut out of the story that not much would change, hopefully we don't follow her much.\\n\r\n- The power use, it's an issue only at time but when it's the case it's really infurating. For exemple the ninja has a power which make projectiles allway reach the target, but she stick to usual throwing weapons when she could use needle or glass shard to make them unvoidable or on the other hand really big object which would be hard to parry. Some detail about the way power and transformations work are rather unclear which is overall quite frustrating for exemple power sometime work without transformation, sometime they don't.\\n\r\nAt time It really feel like a cheap way to have the plot progress.\\n\\n\r\nSo to conclude it's not fantastic but if you're in the mood for that kind of edgy, gore battle royale between moe thing then give it a try.",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku tries be new and shocking in a half-baked attempt to win the ever-growing popularity contest that is the steadily-rising \"Madoka replica\" craze. What the producers of these shows haven't learned is that it takes more than cute character designs and violence in order to successfully win over an audience. \r\nSo we have a magical girl survival game anime. From the premise of the show alone we can conclude that there will be lots of death. And here is where they made their first mistake. Giving details about the plot before the show aired. They outright tell us it's going to bedark before we even watch the show. The element of surprise is completely lost, which leaves little to no room for impact when the plot gets into motion. Now anyone who has seen Madoka or any of it's replicas could see the \"twist\" coming from a mile away, but in this case it doesn't even count as a twist because it was revealed before the show even started airing. \\n\\n\r\nThis leaves us additional problems with pacing and characterization. We know from the start what we're getting ourselves into. And yet it takes about half the series just for the characters to find out that they're supposed to fight each other to the death. If the series was twice as long the slow pacing might have worked to it's advantage, but with a twelve episode series and cast of 16 characters there isn't enough time to work with a slow plot build-up. \\n\\n\r\nYep, 16 characters. That's an awful lot of personalities and backstories to incorporate into 4 hours. As a result you end up with poor characterization. Each character's past is revealed, however their backstories are totally glossed over for maybe two minutes per episode. We don't get any real insight on the effects their experiences had on them because of how little screen time each character gets. The 'bad' girls get the worst of it. Their motives are so shallow and don't make a whole lot of sense. It's almost like the creator said \"screw motives we'll just make these girls assholes for the sake of being assholes!\" The writers also have a bad a habit of killing off characters with any ounce of likability first. \\n\\n\r\nThe end result was...sort of...very predictable. I think we can all pretty much agree who's going to win from the start of the anime but it's still interesting to watch. Despite all of it's flaws the story isn't completely horrible. It isn't great but it isn't horrible. I believe that the people working on this show at least tried to make something enjoyable. And it is enjoyable. But it's not amazing and far from being \"the next Madoka.\"",

            "content": "This is a non spoiler review. \r\nI started out to watch this series without any expectations on the story and character development, I just wanted to see some cool battle scenes, death and blood. Now at the end I must say I am deeply impressed by this series as it has exceeded all my expectations. \r\nDo not watch this expecting to be Madoka, some characters might look similar but this is a whole different story. Although in Madoka, none of the magical girls know about the world they live in, here all but the main character know about the world they live in and thetwisted personalities. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion this is a psychological masterpiece. This anime manages to portray society with 16 characters, amazing indeed. To really understand this anime you need know know a bit of psychology. You have abusive characters, you have deeply sociopathic characters which get abused by the abusive ones (as in real life this does not go well), you have the transgender type and the lesbian couple (bold in my opinion to be portrayed in anime). You have relationships between these characters, however the relationships and character development is portrayed very short throughout the anime but in a enough quantity to understand the character. How much can you fit in 12 episodes and 16 characters?  \\n\\n\r\nThe main character, although fundamentally reminds of Madoka, in fact she is very different and also exhibiting psychopathic (not sociopathic) traits having little empathy for what is happening to people around her. Should there be a second season, she will be explored more. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, lighting is very well made, the emphasis on the eyes of different characters is very nice also. Some key battle scenes contain flashbacks of the protagonists so it kind of breaks the rhythm if you will.\\n\r\nAlso I think the biggest negative aspect is the predictability of the person who is going to die, most episodes contain a flashback of the next to die at the beginning. The element of surprise could have been better made in my opinion. As for music, I really liked the end and beginning songs, apart from this nothing special in my book. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAgain from a psychological point of view the portrayal of certain personalities is top notch. It will be an emotional roller-coaster, you will love characters, some are funny as hell and lovable without being lollis,  you will deeply hate others and wait for the next episode in hope they will die...in blood since it's fitting for them, wait I sound weird....but yes, it's how this anime plays with your emotions. A gem worth watching!",

            "content": "Spoilers in the review are kept to a minimal, though proceed with caution if you are about to read this before watching the show.\r\nWhile there is normally at least one \u2018Battle Royale (or Hunger Games if you want something more familiar)-esque show\u2019, with Mirai Nikki having set the trend, even that show has been more or less a way for critics to circle jerk all day because of how bad it is. Sadly, this has been true for a lot of anime that has attempted to follow its foots steps: Fate/Zero had amazing potential if three quarters of the whole show hadn\u2019t been spent ondialogue, Fate/Stay Night (lumping both its Ufotable and Deen counterparts respectively) was basically a cocky writer thinking that any plot convenient tool can be passed as high art, Danganronpa was well\u2026 Danganronpa, and Big Order was basically Mirai Nikki if none of the staff working on it gave a flying fuck about quality control!\\n\\n\r\nAnd thanks to studio Lerche (who ironically created that piece of cancer called Dangonronpa which I still refuse to watch) we finally got a decent Battle Royal anime show \u2013 which I suppose it\u2019s better late than never, but this is modern anime we\u2019re talking about.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, if you\u2019re already getting annoyed now that I am referring the term \u2018battle royale\u2019 as \u2018battle royal\u2019, I\u2019ve done five seconds of research: http://grammarist.com/spelling/battle-royal/\\n\\n\r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku, or Raising Project (half of the English title) as I would rather prefer to call it, has actual character depth and development, in the sense that you actually get to know who these magical girls are as people and not just cute girls doing cute things \u2013 you get to know how they live their daily lives, how they treat the people around them and how their personal experiences influence their actions as Magical girls. Despite some of the characters being archetypal, there seems to be a significant portion of the cast where you can see that person as a somewhat viable human being which expands on the archetype, something I rarely see in anime, since most archetypes are just cookie cutter placeholders for either clich\u00e9s or \u2018cute girls doing cute things\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really separates Raising Project when compared its (mostly!) retarded battle royal counterparts is that rather than \u2018only one can be claimed victor\u2019, there should be \u2018some survivors\u2019 of the whole battle royal ordeal to be claimed as winners. This little gimmick actually poses some additional factors as to how the survival game has to be played: making alliances would become a more effective option, teamwork would be seen as valuable in surviving the game, characters have a greater tendency to trust each other and it\u2019s an overall refreshing twist on the genre. Maybe it\u2019s just that good to be classified as battle royal anime.\\n\\n\r\nI should definitely give the show a lot of praise if it actually stuck to that formula; nearing the end of the show, a new game master was revealed and then the rules changed saying that actually, only one needs to survive in order to win. While that does spark some sudden tension and conflict within the cast, this also the turning point when things start to feel a bit rushed: battles start using less tactics and became more of battle of \u2018who has the coolest powers\u2019, certain characters\u2019 start dying so quickly to the point I forgot about them and the ending \u2013 though quite an unexpected resolve and is something that should be seen to be understood, I can\u2019t help but to have this gut feeling that it\u2019s just an excuse for sequel-baiting.\\n\\n\r\nEven some of the newly introduced cast on the beyond the half-way point of the show start to feel lacking in excuses for the audience to care about them \u2013 yes it is an admirable attempt that the writers like to show a character\u2019s background just moments later they are killed off (which of course is still leagues ahead than treating a character like cannon fodder), but that\u2019s just the laziest form of persuading an audience to care about a character. \\n\\n\r\nIf I were to give the benefit of the doubt, the show had far too many characters and too little time (like 12 episodes worth) for viewers to be emotionally invested in any form. Really, the show was a pretty cool twist on both the battle royal and magical girl genre, with substantial amount of good material to chew through until it starts to feel a bit rushed in the end; it could use another 12 episodes to develop the cast better and for everything to be put in a neat little package. Still worth the watch, especially if you are comparing this show from everything else in 2016, then this the surprise of the year!\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you wanted me to talk about the art, sound and animation... it exists... as if it's just, mediocre? Like... the OP is okay I guess.\\n",

            "content": "So, where should I start this review? Honestly, I don't know where to begin but this screams out \"Madoka Magica\" to me. It has the moe-like characters, and the innocent Magical Girl era through the beginning until it takes a turn to a more dark atmosphere. You can't help but feel attracted to it, as if, you're being pulled in. This anime is beyond the best.\r\nSnow White reminds me of Madoka. La Pucelle reminds me of Sayaka. Ripple reminds of Homura. Top Speed reminds me of Mami. Pon reminds me of Kyubey. Not sure who the other characters remind me of, but it just broughtme those Madoka Magica feels during Raising Project. No words, I cried at the deaths of Weiss Winterprison, Sister Nana, Top Speed, and La Pucelle. My personal favorites were Ripple and Weiss, I have to say, the designs were perfectly well done. The music was catchy, the opening was amazing. Each episode, brought chills up my spine and you can't help but keep watching since you want to know what happens next. Cranberry and Swim Swim weren't obviously my favorites, but the other Magical Girl's pasts were just... I was speechless. I was just mindblown. Tama's past was the one that made me cry the most, and Ripple's as well. You couldn't blame poor Ripple for punching those who said those horrible things. Neither could you blame Tama, she was doing her best at everything she could! \\n\\n\r\nLa Pucelle was a character that you could enjoy and a character that you could think of in a romantic relationship with the caring and sweet, Snow White. It was a shame Cranberry came in... That, by far, was my only favorite pairing in the whole anime. Otherwise, everything of this Magical Girl anime is the best. It's amazing. You can't unsee this, the second time you watch it, you'll start to feel attached to one of the Magical Girls. Obviously enough, it was like Madoka Magica. I DO NOT like Pon, at all. But otherwise...\\n\\n\r\nThis by far, was my FAVORITE 2016 anime and always will be.",

It's just that there's one part of the magical girl genre we all know. The dark magical girl genre.\r\nOkay, you may say \"Oh my gosh, this is a copy of PMMM!\"\r\nNope.\r\nAs a LN reader, I get offended when people compare MGRP to PMMM. They are nothing similar. One is about 16 magical girls and they get halved and the other is a totally innocent magical girl show.\r\nIf you've watched PMMM, at least give this a chance. I promise you, it's not that bad.\r\nStory:7\r\nOkay, thestory is what you probably would expect. You have your \"weak\" main character(I say this because she does grow) and she turns into a magical girl. Then (huh!!!) everything quickly turns twisted. I have to say, the  \\n\r\nstory was kind of cliche. There are a lot of tropes in this series like, \"Childhood Friend\", \"Weak Main Character\" and etc. The anime sort of screwed up the ending by not telling us viewers why Snow and Ripple were fighting at the end and by also not introducing a certain character. \\n\\n\\n\r\nYes, the story is somewhat mediocre. But, as the episodes rolled on, I felt like it got better and better.\\n\\n\r\nSo: RECAP: First half, weak. Second half, good. Ending, eh?\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:6\\n\\n\r\nOkay, guys, I'm not an art person. Despite art being my minor, I can't draw. So please don't take this part as seriously as the other categories of the series. Okay, so I believe the art was okay. Wasn't bad, wasn't very good. The animation wasn't very fluid to me. It kinda just used exaggerated movements to depict action. During the fights, however, the animation is very fluid and is great.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are actually pretty good. They represent the character that received the design.\\n\\n\r\nSound:5\\n\\n\r\nOk, just no. Why was this done like this? \\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode, the music was decent to me. However, when they start repeating the music OVER and OVER, it gets very boring and tiring. To me, there are only like 6 songs in the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nOk, see?\\n\\n\r\n1. Opening \\n\r\n2. Ending\\n\r\n3.Battle Theme \\n\r\n4. Fun Theme\\n\r\n5. Calamity Mary vs Ripple(Finally!)\\n\r\n6. Sad Theme \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe ending and the opening were good, at least.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects were good, as well, but the whole sound of the anime was very mediocre.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7\\n\r\nThe characters were good. Although the main character was sort of bland at this point in the MGRP series, the other main characters were reasonably developed, however, the went overboard on the backstories.\\n\\n\r\nNothing else to say, really. The characters were not 3-dimensional, but weren't like cardboard either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nThis is the high-point of the anime. The theorizing about who dies next and who kills who is very fun. It's tragic when someone dies, but that's then enjoyable part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:7\\n\r\nThe series isn't that bad. Granted, it isn't very good either, but as an LN reader, I can tell you that the next few arcs do a way better job at composition and stuff.",

            "content": "A couple of shows have tried to imitate the dark magical girl concept since 2011's Madoka Magica, but they have mostly been failures, with the only decently good one so far being 2014's Selector Infected WIXOSS. Now finally, we have one that can be labelled great. I present to you Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku (Magical Girl Raising Project),the best elimination game/battle royale show since 2012's Fate/Zero. \r\nOne aspect which the show does really well is that there is very equal distribution of screen-time amongst the characters. This series avoids the all too common pitfall of battle royale series focusing too much on one character andsetting them up to obvious be the \"good guy\" and win against a horde of \"bad guys\". Of course. this series has a protagonist, but she does not influence the main plot very much in comparison to many of the other characters, and the motivations and psyche of the side-characters are explored as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is really diverse. Though technically they are all magical girls, their real-life personas are that of a lesbian couple, an alcoholic divorcee, a salarywoman, a politician's housewife, twins studying in university, a grade schooler, an actual boy, and so on and on. Some are total psychopaths, some are useless white-knights, some are morally grey characters. \\n\\n\r\nViewers can see a character dying way before it happens. But I think it is justified as killing a character out of nowhere would bring complains that there is no viewer attachment to that particular character. And for a show with only a runtime of 12 episodes and having more characters than episodes to kill, I think it did its best in utilising it's runtime in making the viewers care for the characters. Most of the deaths were impactful to me, which is very impressive given the number of characters and the very short amount of time to forge a connection.\\n\\n\r\nThe show never aimed to create any suspense about whether a character would die. It was more of when, not if. No character is safe, no plot amour exists here. I got sick to the stomach and dead inside repeatedly seeing characters I cared about dying over and over.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights are short and quick, there's no monologuing in battles; the girls don't stand and gloat over their opponents before finishing them off. In fact, in most cases, the causes of death is just a sudden split-second hit. There's no long drawn-out scenes of magical girls beating the shit out of each other (unlike basically every Hollywood superhero film nowadays) and it really highlights the danger and the power of the magical girls. One hit and you are dead. A moment of hesitation, a moment of distraction, that's all the difference. In other shows, characters can take crazy amounts of hits and damage, but here, out of nowhere, holy fuck they died?\\n\\n\r\nDon't go into the show comparing it to Madoka. While it does have a lot of similarities, the key concepts are vastly difference and it is a fantastic watch regardless.\\n\\n\r\nI don't rate my anime as 7 is average unlike most people on MAL. 5 is average, 6 is good and so on. So this rating of 8 means a lot.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely anime of the year. Criminally underrated.\\n",

I'm not kidding, I note that, with exception of one, the characters are become or cliche or unidimensional villain. \r\nThis anime is the best example from a light novel compressed adaptation. I don't know the quality of the original material, however, this detail is notable. However, is entertaining. I special critizice the fleeting appearance of the many magical girls characters and the lack of the shock factor in many deaths. However, I praise the loyalty and respect from the series essence of the final chapter.\r\nNote: the blood and the violence excess doesn't meangood quality.",

            "content": "Story and setting \r\nMagical girls raising project despite the name is a actually a fight anime that pits girls that have the power of transforming into magical girls into fighting each other to avoid being deleted and wait for it to die in real life upon doing so. Think of SAO with magical girls instead. The story follows the girls after they were chosen to become magical girls after they were chosen from a game that they were all playing. \r\nIn terms of setting this takes place in modern era Japan which also serves as the area for this death game. \r\nSnow white \r\nSnow whitevoiced by veteran seiyuu Nao Toyama is one of the magical girls that take part in this game. Unlike most of the other girls Snow believes strongly that magical girls should only help people and not harm or kill others and as such when the game become a death game she was visibly unhinged. Despite everything Snow white stayed above the killing and managed to survive not because she was lucky but because she had strong allies that sadly perished in her defense. This had the effect of affecting her mental status but she did not break down and instead kept surviving until she was confronted with the horrible truth. Other combat oriented magical girls like Ripple or swim swim Snow white has weak magic and combat skills but loves to help people making her the ideal image of a magical girl. Being able to hold to your ideas despite threat of death is no small feat and i respect her for that. Nao Toyama as always did a excellent job portraying snow white. \\n\\n\r\nRipple played by veteran seiyuu Manami Numakura of Unlimited Fafnir fame is a fellow magical girl that is dressed and equipped like a ninja. She and Top speed were partners and Top speed was Ripples mentor. As such they had a very close bond with each other. Due to family trouble Ripple moved out of her family house and lives alone thus causing her to be rather antisocial and aggressive which i guess why she styled herself as a ninja. Ripple is a quiet person by nature and warms up slowly to others with Top speed the only one she talks constantly with. However Ripple does respect those that keep to their ideas like snow white. As one of the most combat oriented magical girls Ripple fights multiple battles with the other girls notably against Calamity Mary and Swim Swim and surviving both. \\n\\n\r\nI felt that Manami Numakura did a great job voicing Ripple and arguably after snow white she's one of my fav characters. \\n\\n\r\nRuler played by veteran seiyuu Yoko Hikasa of the devil is a part timer fame is a fellow magical girl that styles herself as a queen. Ruler leads a small group of magical girls that operate on the fringe of the city that the anime is based in. Despite appearing horrible to others Ruler does try to help members of her team when they need it like when she helped Tama understand parts of her order book that Tama didn't understand. Despite that her overbearing nature proved to be her downfall after a shocking betrayal. \\n\\n\r\nLa Pucelle played by veteran seiyuu Ayane Sakura of Charlotte fame is a fellow magical girl and a childhood friend of Snow white. Along with Ripple and Winterprison La Pacelle was one of the most combat oriented of the magical girls and as such was able to deal with ambushes from Rulers team quite easily. La Pucelle can best be described as a loyal, quick thinking person that values Snow white and respects her for her ideas. Sadly La Pucelle did not get to see how the game ended. \\n\\n\r\nMagicoloid44 played by veteran seiyuu Satomi Arai of Re zero fame is a fellow magical girl that is actually a robot. Due to being homeless in her real life she values money more than anything else and will not hesitate to harm other girls if only to survive the game. Her ability is to draw a random gadget from her backpack once a day but the catch is that it could be anything and sometimes it can be a useless gadget as well. Because of her focus on money i actually wonder why she become a magical girl in the first place lol. \\n\\n\r\nWinterprison played by veteran seiyuu Yu Kobayashi is a fellow magical girl that is partnered with Sister Nana. Winterprison and Sister Nana are close both in real life and in game being a real life couple that value each other dearly. Winterprison can be described as calm, logical and quick thinking and is a formidable combatant but despite that still fell to a sneak attack. Winterprison's ability was to create walls of any form using the terrain that she stands on which can be used in both offence and defense. \\n\\n\r\nCalamity Mary voiced by veteran seiyuu Kikuko Inoue is a fellow magical girl that largely operates alone. Of of all magical girls she is the most unstable out of them and to top it off she kills more than she saves with her weapons being firearms. Her ability seems to a perfect fit for her as it enhances her weapons with magic. Arguably the most aggressive and egomaniac of all the girls Mary cares little about saving people and merely lives to fight. \\n\\n\r\nTop speed voiced by veteran seiyuu Yumi Uchiyama of The irregular at magic high school and Arpeggio of blue steel fame is a fellow magical girl and the partner to Ripple. Wise, calm and logical Top speaks in a peculiar accent and dresses in the outfit of a traditional western witch. Of the pair Top speed is usually the one that stops Ripple from doing dangerous things and as such they have a rather strong bond. Top speed was one of my favorite witches on the show and it was sad seeing her fate. Her real life persona was actually very similar to her in game self as well. \\n\\n\r\nSister Nana voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Hayami and my third favourite seiyuu is a fellow magical girl and partner to Winterprison. Sister Nana's most prominent trait is probably her outfit in which she is dressed like a western nun. Kind, kind hearted and good nature Sister Nana like her namesake detests fighting and like snow white believes that Magical girls should be helping people and each other. Sister Nana upon finding that the game has become a death game tried her hardest to contact the admins to end the game to no avail. Sister Nana has a deep bond with her partner and was devastated upon losing her. \\n\\n\r\nHardgore Alice voiced by veteran seiyuu Rina Hidaka of Sword art online fame is a fellow magical girl that is the newest magical girl to the game. Her name is a play on Alice in wonderland and her outfit is from that that is draped in black. Alice displays very few emotions due to her real life persona's personality which meek and unsociable due to family trouble. Alice's ability is rather peculiar in that even when reduced to a head Alice can still regenerate herself. Alice respected Snow white a great deal as she was the reason that she become a magical girl and as such she wanted to meet her and though scaring her at first with her appearance they soon become fast friends. This role is very different to roles that Rina Hidaka usually takes but its nice to see that Rina is trying to branch out. \\n\\n\r\nCranberry voiced by veteran seiyuu Megumi Ogata is fellow magical girl that mostly acted as the recluse until much later in the series when she become the main villain. Cranberry was part of the previous intake of magical girls and enjoyed killing so much that she decided that she only existed to fight strong enemies. A powerful combatant Cranberry was a strong villain that Snow white and others and to contend with until her unlucky death. Being one of the two villains in the show Cranberry did well and was a great villain being both powerful and crafty. \\n\\n\r\nSwim Swim voiced by veteran seiyuu Inori Minase is a fellow magical girl that was initially part of Rulers group but later went her own way after her betrayal. Swim Swim is calm, precise and smart able to act on information that she finds with great speed and skill even more so when she begins using a scythe as a weapon of choice. Swim Swim has a rather quiet and reserved personality but nonetheless a great planner and came close to actually winning the game. Swim replaced Cranberry as the second villain after Cranberries untimely demise. \\n\\n\r\nFav is the mascot of the game that communicates with the girls in the game. Although at first helpful to the girls Fav's attitude changes as the game goes on and the body count rises becoming more cynical as it goes. Fav is one of the overseers of the game that orchestrated this entire game with Cranberry to choose the right girl for their project. Arguably one of the most hated villains in the series. \\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\r\nArt style for the series i felt was done well with the character designs being especially well designed. The fight scenes themselves were also pretty well designed and each of the abilities of the girls used was animated well. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\r\nVoice acting i felt was pretty good especially Nao Toyama who voiced Snow white, Manami Numakura who voiced Ripple and Yumi Uchiyama who voiced Top speed. Saori Hayami who voiced Sister Nana and Rina Hidaka who voiced Alice also did pretty well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\\n\r\nThe music i felt was well done and the scene music felt appropriate for the scenes that it was in. The opening and ending themes i felt was also well done. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Magical girls had a great take on the classic magical girls genre by changing it to a sort of a hybrid between a fighting anime and a magical girl one with the result combing elements of both. Magical girls i felt had a pretty good story and a great cast of characters but some of the deaths felt a bit cheap. Voice acting was solid throughout and series had some solid fight scenes. \\n\\n",

            "content": "SPOILER FREE\r\nStory\r\n9/10\r\nI absolutely loved the story of this anime. I just finished watching it and I found every twist and turn very exciting! It follows middle-school student Koyuki Himekawa who, after playing the social app \"Magical Girl Raising Project\", discovers she can become a magical girl. In total, there are 16 magical girls in the city. She soon discovers that Fav, the mascot character of the game, miscalculated the number of magical girls he'd be able to accommodate for, and so has to half the number to eight. This starts of a simple competition, where each magical girl sees who can complete the most gooddeeds in order to collect candy, and whoever has the least drops out. However, the rules soon become twisted, and the girls are forced into a much more sinister game. I think this set-up with the great twists and mysteries really made the story!\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nI found the art of this anime, although a bit basic, to be very pretty. The backgrounds are  excellently drawn, and the character designs are, overall,  very well done. However, there is one problem I did notice. Some of the character designs seemed a bit thrown together. Designs like Sister Nana and  Hardgore Alice were very simple and sweet, and looked like complete characters. But characters like La Pucelle and Swim Swim seemed a bit mis-matched in their designs. For example, Swim Swim had a swimming outfit, head phones, bunny patterns, bat wings and some weird wire things coming off if her. None of these elements were bad, but they didn't seem to go together at all, and ended up making her look messy.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n6/10\\n\r\nThe intro to Mahou Shojou Ikusei Keikaku, Sakebe, wasn't anything remarkable. It wasn't a bad song by any means, and the animation that went with it was very nice, but it got a bit boring after a while and I found myself skipping it at the start of every episode. The same goes of the ending theme, Dream Catcher. They're both nice songs, but I didn't really feel like they fit the tone of the series at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nThe character were one of the best elements of this anime. Every single one had great personalities inside and outside of their magical girl forms. My particular favorites were Top Speed, Cranberry and Hardgore Alice. The reason these characters all stood out is because they all seemed like they were going to be very stock, but all ended up surprising me. Top Speed had a lot more depth and motivation than I thought she would, Cranberry wasn't just a basic hotheaded rival, and Hardgore Alice wasn't just a dull kuudere. They all presented themselves as overused anime stereotypes and had me pleasantly surprised by their finer details.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\n\"Enjoy\" isn't exactly the word I would use this anime. It always had me on the edge of my seat, always morbidly curious as to what would happen next. But enjoy isn't the word I would use for when I'm crying over the fictional corpse of an anime girl! However, I still score 9/10 because it always kept me interested, as well as on my toes, as it too spontaneous to predict!\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nOverall, it was a fun,surprisingly dark and interesting anime to watch.  Although it was a bit cliche at times, you can't help but admire the heart put into it! I definitely recommend it, as well as the light novels it's based on!",

            "content": "You might notice this anime gets compared a lot to Madoka Magica, however, they aren't nearly the same thing. Madoka aims to be a deconstruction of the magical girl genre while magical girl isn't even the primary genre of Magical Girl Raising Project. It's a survival game anime, it just has magical girl characters, that's all. The magical girl concepts take the background really quick, in fact, you can probably show someone a random episode of this anime and they wouldn't even guess it's a magical girl anime, just eccentric girls dressed in weird clothes killing each other.\r\nSo that's the kind of show this isand you'd probably enjoy it for reasons you'd enjoy survival games. Seeing the cool fights and how characters go through the anxiety of the kill or be killed situation. How some of the characters want to find peaceful solutions, some wanting to go ahead with the killing game, how some betray the others and so on.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the beginning, the characterization was done really well even if all the characters are magical girls, there is even one guy who turned into a magical girl if you're interested in that. There are a variety of them with different personalities, designs and issues they deal with, particularly in their backstories. Certain character's actions are even quite shocking but then make sense if you think about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing for the first half of the anime was great in getting us to know the characters while building up to the major conflicts that will occur then having some interactions between to have us feel the characters. Unfortunately however, this fine pacing doesn't last. After approximately the halfway point, this series becomes really action focused, many character interactions and tension build up get rushed just to get to the kickass fights.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights themselves are all good though, well paced long enough to show the abilities of the magical girls and seeing how one overcomes the other. Sometimes you can really feel the characters struggles and it's fun to see how the different match ups play out with them all being unique in their own way. It's just the problem is that many fights feel like they just come out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with this series is how it can be predictable in most cases due to being formulaic(as I said, there are of course exceptions). Many characters get a tonne of death flags before well... their deaths. Usually in the form of some backstory reveal. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the art is pretty and there's nothing wrong with the animation. Get used to watching night time settings though, because that's what most of this show takes place during. The opening and ending songs are nice and although the scenes themselves have a lot of quiet moments, when the fights come, there are usually some epic music to enhance them.\\n\\n\r\nSo that's it, this is a fairly good show although it could have been great. Perhaps it suffered the limitations of just being 1 cour, if it had been longer, they might have been able to take time with the tension build ups, have room for character interactions and explore their backstories without having them be blatant death flags.\\n\\n\r\nIt is surprisingly great for an anime filled with cute girls however, so you might like to give Magical Girl Raising Project a go even if you aren't usually into those kinds of shows. I'll be giving this anime a 6/10, though keep in mind that a 6 is in now way bad. It just still has some problems and I just like to reserve higher scores for the amazing stuff. Maybe if this anime had fixed some problems mentioned and it had been 2 cours, it may even reach a 7 or 8. Well if you decide to pick this anime up and watch, enjoy.",

            "content": "Magical Girl Raising Project brings the gore and intense action but other aspects of the show leave a lot to be desired.\r\nThis anime may not be the best overall show but I am still glad I watched it because it succeeded in packing in some awesome and intense gory action sequences.  The storyline is pretty basic but the overall theme of magical girls fighting each other to the death through brutal action sequences and twisted super powers was pretty entertaining at times.  One of the reasons these actions sequences were so much fun is because the powers of the magical girls are smartlyvaried.  There are girls with gun skills, speed skills, melee skills, and interesting other super powers.  This keeps the action and suspense interesting throughout the show because it is hard to predict which girls would win which matches.  The extreme gore and all out horror themed settings/backdrops also added to the action because it created a \u201cno strings attached\u201d exploitative feel to the series and as a fan of horror this kept me looking forward to each episode so if anything this anime definitely isn\u2019t boring.  The action was well paced and well-crafted consistently throughout the show and the sleek and modern animation style added an incredible amount of detail during these bloody sequences.  The animation also elevated the fear and intensity of the character expressions adding to the horror action elements of the show.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately while this anime\u2019s horror action is fun to watch the rest of the show is pretty shallow.  The first disappointing aspect of this show is the characters.  The main character Snow White is supposedly the moral compass of the show.  However, she is incredibly flandarized as an overly cutesy and na\u00efve person.  Because of this, I never connected to her as a character because she was not multi-dimensional.  This was made worse by the fact that her character never changes from the beginning of the show to the end.  The rest of the side cast is annoyingly underdeveloped as well as the show tries to develop every member of the side cast but fails because there are over 16 other magical girls besides Snow White and there are only 12 episodes in the series.  Therefore, we learn about the backstories of every girl but besides their backstories there is hardly any time to connect with any of them emotionally.  The other way in which this affects the show is that some of the magical girls are clearly more interesting and unique then others so certain characters feel annoyingly sidelined. Personally, I wanted to learn a lot more about Hardgore Alice and Calamity but we never got the chance.  Overall, there were no bad characters but no characters who I felt a connection to either.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with this show is the overall storyline.  It is a very standard \u201cfight to the death\u201d storyline.  It is tightly wound and entertaining.  However, it is nothing new or unique in today\u2019s current times and it does feel like wasted potential as the writing often alludes to greater ideas but it never takes that leap to become something amazing.  On top of that there are certain \u201caspects\u201d that are clearly \u201cinspired\u201d by Madoka Magica.  I won\u2019t go into them in detail to avoid spoilers but it was something that held the show back from becoming its own unique experience.  Overall, the story isn\u2019t particularly bad but it is very linear and standard.\\n\\n\r\nI am still glad I watched Magical Girl Raising Project because of the fighting sequences and as a fan of horror it was fun at times.  However, the rest of the experience was to lackluster for me to recommend this to those just getting into anime or those searching for a memorable experience.  If you like lots of bloody action and horror elements you will probably enjoy this but for anyone else I\u2019m not so sure.\\n",

            "content": "Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku was. So not good that it's spurred me to write a review. Some little masochistic part of me decided to stick with this stuff past episode 3, so I plowed through all 12 terrible episodes and now I'm here I guess!! I'm going to do my best not to drop spoilers, and if you liked this thing you're entitled to your opinion, but god. Just christ almighty.\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nI'm going to say this as someone who enjoyed DanganRonpa, marginally enjoyed Mirai Nikki, and is always looking for interesting Deadly Game type stories. This story was... garbage. All the twists were clearly visiblyfrom a mile away, characters didn't get background until they either a) Died or b) were about to die. The story itself just felt like it was checking boxes. Heartbreaking friend death, innocent child's death, etc. The plot has a nasty habit of jumping to one character, focusing solely on them for episodes, then completely ignoring them. You'll spend episodes with a character or three, watch a few die, then never learn that they had prior obligations or anything until 3 episodes later. I know that they only had 12 episodes to get this barely-a-story across, but honestly, I don't think they would've benefited from any extra episodes. A lot of this stuff felt gore-porn-y and torture-porn-y, and relying too heavily on those tropes destroyed any interest this could've had for me. It failed to deliver on the premise that made it so promising.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, it was trying so hard to be edgy while also collecting tropes and attempting weird character skips that the plot essentially evaporated. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 2/10\\n\r\nI'm sorry, I know a lot of the reasons people picked up this thing was because of the cute art, and I will agree that sometimes it has its moments! But the mascot looked, sounded, and acted like some combination of Monokuma and Kyuubey, to the point I could've just switched one for either of the others and the plot would've been the same. Also, and this is more of a personal thing here, I absolutely hated how every girl looked like she was 12. We have characters in their late teens, 20's, and early 30's and possibly 40's here and they all look like they aren't a day out of elementary school. It's especially bothering considering they were capable of drawing adult looking characters, clearly pointed out by the amount of civilians who look normal! And god, the magical girl outfits. I absolutely hated almost every single one. They were clunky, boring, too busy, all sex appeal or just plain bland. Out of 16 magical girls I think I only liked about 2 or 3 of the outfits (Magicaloid is a robot, and therefore I'm not sure if she counts as an \"outfit\" but she was one of the designs I found interesting.) The artists clearly struggled with making good color palettes here, because the colors too were either so pastel the character looked washed out or clashy and uncoordinated. This might sound like too much time to spend griping about character outfits, but a lot of magical girl anime's charm is the cute outfits, and as that feels like it falls under art, I wanted to critique it here. MSKI didn't even fall short within my expectations. It fell 1000 feet away from my expectations. \\n\\n\r\nIn shorter terms, everyone regardless of age looks like a middle schooler, making this uncomfortably like a child gore show. Also outfits were ugly.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nNot a lot to say here. Pretty standard magical girl soundtrack. Wasn't terrible, wasn't jaw dropping good, generally fit whatever mood the story was struggling to convey.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nI'm prefacing this with, usually, if a character's personality/writing is good I can ignore lazy writing. But they were not good at all. It was impossible to care about any of these characters whatsoever, because all the background we got on them was seconds before they died. I can't miss a character if there's nothing to be missed. Haphazardly throwing in things like \"oh she's pregnant!\" or \"oh they're dating!\" moments before death or episodes after isn't development. There's no meat to the characters, there's nothing to actually hold onto and fall in love with. They're all basically just bloodbags for the plot to rip open so it can deliver on the \"Ohh uwu edgy\" that it keeps trying to tell you it'll deliver. A character who gets exposition and expanded on moments before or after their death is not a round, fleshed out character. They're just a flat character with something tragic pinned on them to try and get audiences to care. Backgrounds aside, the personalities were bland and trope-y. We've got the god-complex girl, the crazy girl, the naive girl, the stupid girl, the NEET girl, on and on. Everyone fits a trope. It wouldn't be bad if they had tried to subvert the tropes, but they didn't try at all. And that's not bad either. Unless you're trying to market a diverse group of magical girls. \\n\\n\r\nShorter: Boring characters with shoddy \"development.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd while I'm under characters, I'd like to take a moment to talk about Snow White. Despite being the headliner character, she's almost completely absent, only showing up to cry to whoever is going to die for her this time about how little she wants to kill and how oh so cruel it is that they're in a killing game. It gets annoying. She never toughens up, she never tries to protect anyone, all she does it watch while her friends go down for her one by one, give up their lives so she can live another day, then she just cries about it. Now, arguably, she also has one of the weakest magics, but come on. She's a magical girl! She can still punch and kick, and for over half the crew that's all you really needed to do to get them to step off. I found myself actually feeling nauseous every time I saw her face, because all she did was whine and complain and cry and every time she did I knew whatever magical girl was with her at the time was definitely toast. She's like a banshee, if you hear her start to cry about how cruel whats-it's-face the mascot is, or how she didn't want being a magical girl to turn out like this, you know any other character within earshot of her is completely boned. She's a boring and bland protagonist that only serves as a red flag that someone in the scene with her is gonna die. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI think the paragraphs above accurately portray how I felt about this show. I took a 5 minute break from this show and ended up having a 4 minute existential crisis, so take that how you will.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\nThe extra point here is from sound. Overall, this was a godawful experience for me, and I write this in the hope it's a warning akin to my head on a pike in front of the wasteland of this anime. I can't believe this got me to write a review. I *never* write reviews. I sat through all of Special A and Vampire Knight and didn't write a review.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I don't care if anyone else enjoyed this, I'm not one to judge tastes, and if you enjoyed it, good for you! Congrats on being able to find something good where I couldn't. \\n\\n\r\nBut please, please, please, if you're thinking of watching this, think critically about whether or not you want to watch this. If you want magical girls, watch any season of Precure, or Sailor Moon, or Madoka Magica or any other thousands of magical girl anime out there. If you want deadly games watch DanganRonpa or Mirai Nikki. If you want something gore-y watch Neon Genesis Evangelion. Just, please reconsider, and hit that little masochistic part of you with a broom like I should've done.",

            "content": "\"What does it mean to be a magical girl?\"\r\nI'll try to refrain from spoiling too much, however, there's some things I will have to mention (without specifics) in order to give an accurate review.\r\nMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku caught my eye in Youtube clips because I thought it would deal with serious topics. Without looking much up, I went for the show, and just downed it in one go. While it did manage to keep me up overnight, and I was certainly not wrong about the serious topic issue, it just.. took too many of them off the shelf to the point of becoming both melodramaticand extremely predictable.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 2\\n\r\nThe story went just a slippery slope downhill and it felt incredibly forced in the direction it was going. I feel like the creator was really trying to imitate Madoka Magica, but failed miserably. as the story lacked thrill due to its predictability, frequent nonsensicalness, and just flat out melodrama. The premise and initial information gets quickly derailed into something that initially wasn't there, resulting in more plot holes than swiss cheese.\\n\r\nI can't give it higher than a 2. The only thing that was good was the initial premise and the idea behind it. Too many shows these days do that - fantastic concept, horrible flow.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nNothing special, but the art was quite gorgeous at points. It didn't delve deep into aesthetic and atmosphere, but I liked its looks. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 5\\n\r\nIt wasn't... memorable? There was nothing ear-catching nor off-putting about the sound. I liked the ending theme, but the opening theme was very run-of-the-mill. Medioce rating for that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3\\n\r\nWhile the characters could've been the strongest aspect of the show, and one of them was a reason why I finished the series in the first place, more often than not they were shallow and underdeveloped and some of them were very confusing.\\n\r\nThe show merely didn't let the characters grow as people, or grow in attachment to us. This was because the show was very rushed, or well... yeah the characters got killed too fast.\\n\r\nAnother big problem there was is that very often the characters' objectives became nonsensical or questionable. It's almost as if a simple story got the better of them and made them just be slaves of the story, rather than players in the story.\\n\r\nFinally, a big flaw is the story's main character. She isn't even important for half of the series, just happens to be there at the end. Props for not making her overpowered as shit I guess though???\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4 [completely personal section for me]\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the show was decently enjoyable. Mainly because of the few characters I liked some of the characters, and because it was 5AM. \\n\r\nIt doesn't make you cringe on every centimeter, that's for sure, but it does look back on critical hindsight. The plotholes and nonsense were annoying at worst, not frustrating as I feel with some shows after a few episodes. It's watchable, but not something I would talk about for longer than a day. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3 - Poor [4 - Bad]\\n\r\nHad the show fleshed out the characters more before parting them, kept more of them in the game - or had fewer to begin with, it would make the show far more enjoyable and exciting. Clarifiying some characters' objectives, and not making them slaves of the story, would also help this show greatly. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend for: If you are flat out looking for downhill drama, I guess? Other than that, I can't, sorry...",

On a surface level, it seems similar to Madoka Magica, a well known version of this trope, with strong story similarities to Dangan Ronpa. While this means that the story is not very original feeling, it is still enjoyable and manages to bring some elements and surprises that felt original to me. \r\nThe characters are nicely developed within the time constraints of the 12 episodes, allowing the audience to understand varied and complex motivations. However, it still manages to not feel as if it is forcing you to believe every character is\"good\"despite their reasons for actions, which I can rarely tolerate. While I wish for more development for some characters, I understand only so much can be addressed within 12 episodes.\\n\r\nI have not read the source material for this anime and this adaptation succeeded in being a complete story that can be enjoyed without having to read the light novels. However, it does leave some questions for people to be interested in if they enjoy the story and wish for more.\\n\\n\r\nI will warn people interested that Magical Girl Raising Project could easily be accused of \"Bury Your Gays\" if that presents a problem.",

Well I think Magical Girl Raising Project was really exciting, fun and unique, I don't think the story or characters were all that good. Magical Girl Raising Project just felt rushed in a few areas such as story and character development.\r\nThis review will not contain any spoilers as all i'll be talking about you should be expecting before coming into thisanime.I won't talk about any of the characters deaths or anything, just the premise of the anime. Magical Girl Raising Project uses \"kill all characters\" as it's main focus and will not hesitate to kill off a few characters like a typical \"Rogue Magical Girl\" anime should consist of, however the real problem I have with this anime is not that they like to kill off characters (trust me I love anime's that are able to kill off characters in order to move to plot forward.) \\n\\n\r\nThe real problem I have with this anime is that none of the characters are able to get any real character development due to the anime only having 12 episodes... This is where the underlying problem in the anime comes from, they aren't able to make the characters likable enough that you actually start caring when they kill off or threaten to kill off your favorite character. If this anime had maybe about 24 episodes or so it definitely could've lived up to Madoka Magica but since there was such little time no character development ever happened in this anime, which is why this anime just didn't seem as good compared to Madoka Magica. Don't get me wrong it was still good, but there was so much wasted potential because this anime was only able to get 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis genre is gonna be one of those genres that if a series doesn't get more than 22 episodes, they're gonna have a hard time being considered \"good\" no matter how nice the animation and original the concept is. Because in order for an anime all about killing off fictional characters to be successful you have to be able to create a bond between these characters and the viewer, having only 13 episodes means that if you want to kill off lots of characters and have an actually decent story you're going to be rushed and have to spend less time creating this bond, which was why Magical Girl Raising Project was unable to live up to Madoka Magica. Everything about this anime was really good, the animation, the fight scenes, the plot. However the characters just weren't developed enough for me to even care about any of them and well their deaths were \"sad\" so different reasons, I just found myself shrugging it off like \"Eh they were a boring character anyway.\"",

            "content": "I agree with most people here who are saying that Magical Girl Raising Project wasn't good. This is one of the animes I definitely not recommend to watch. But that doesn't mean this is a Madoka Magica ripoff since it is dark in its own way (hell even I kind of enjoyed Yuki Yuna very much despite being labelled as a 'Madoka ripoff' by fans).\r\nStory- 4\r\nThe story is basically about 16 magical girls in a battle royale type magical girl anime. There are too many problems in this story. First of all there is no reason to why the characters have to become magical girls.It's like they are just...magical girls. That's it. Secondly, Fav who is the Kyubey of this series doesn't do anything in this anime except forcing every character to become magical girls regardless of their gender. Fav doesn't have a motivation to why he grants magical powers to the magical girls. He just likes to indirectly torture magical girls by reducing them into half while the last standing magical girl becomes a master.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I feel like there were a lot of unnecessary gore and dark moments just to show that the series is 'amazing'. I'm sorry but gore and dark moments don't make the series wonderful. This show is only there for pure shock value to such an extent that it becomes easily predictable that a character is going to die in the very next episode. Also this show doesn't look mysterious to me at all. I mean, you are barely 2 seconds before you see a bunch of bloody corpses right in the very beginning which already tells you that the show is not going to be very nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 3\\n\r\nI'm sorry but the characters are poorly written. The characters only receive like 3-5 minutes of their backstory and that too after the person dies or the person is about to die. I'm sorry but there is no point in giving backstories to the characters when they're ALREADY DEAD. I also do not feel attached to the characters at all. The show is trying to hard to make the characters likeable even though all it does is take a magical girl, kill them by making them face a violent death with too much bloodbath and give them like 5 minutes of backstory before proceeding on. The show takes characters deaths too lightly which makes us not feel attached to them at all. I really hoped the show would continued to at least 50 episodes so that we can learn about these characters more but no. They crammed these 16 magical girls  into a 12 episode anime and the dark moments are forced to make us actually feel about these characters even though I've never cried in any episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist Snow White, La Pucelle and Ripple are the only ones I can tolerate a bit but even then Snow White who is the Madoka Kaname of this anime does almost nothing. Sure it is realistic to cry in these situations but that's all she does and she contributes almost nothing to the show in the first place which makes me harder to get attached to her.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 8\\n\r\nThe art was actually pretty good but the characters look just like typical ordinary anime characters. The only thing that made me watch MGRP was the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 5\\n\r\nMost of the songs aren't that memorable but I kinda liked the ending theme. Also I felt like a really happy and cheerful opening theme doesn't fit into a dark anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-4\\n\r\nI'm sorry but this anime was trying too hard to sympathize the characters and the dark moments are for pure shock value to the point that the show becomes very predictable. I literally felt like someone is dragging me to watch this anime as soon I tried to look at it. This anime is not at all recommendable for anyone because the story is presented in a very cheap way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "[This review contains major spoilers.]\r\nI slightly regret watching this.\r\nI definitely wouldn't recommend this to others.\r\nI have watched this once, subtitled. I have only watched the anime.\r\nI won't watch this again.\r\n---- Positives ----\r\nAlthough visual character design is peculiar, the art backing it up is good.\r\nEach character gets good quality art, except for Hardgore Alice's dress. The art quality is notable because of the wide variety of costumes drawn.\r\nSnow White stays a pacifist.\r\nShe claims that she won't hurt anyone and she doesn't at any point in the series. Pacifist characters in Death Game series too often claim pacifism at the start only to make exceptions later on.Pacifism isn't a \"sometimes\" thing.\\n\\n\r\nCranberry was voiced well.\\n\r\nVoice acting all around is decent. Cranberry stands out as well-voiced.\\n\\n\r\n---- Negatives ----\\n\\n\r\nOverarching Negative : unguided Death Game disguised as Magical Girl genre.\\n\r\nThe root negative of this series is that, under the guise of being a Magical Girl series, it's a Death Game series that isn't guided by any author-level planning and is lacking any strong overarching themes. We get a situation, and we get some characters. Nothing is explored deeply and, instead, we watch the characters arbitrarily act after having wrenches thrown in their environment.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No. An unguided series fails as a story on a fundamental level. This series needed at least one strong theme, but didn't have one.\\n\\n\r\nThe violence is bloody and sharply differs from other scenes in the series.\\n\r\nOne moment there are magical girls, the next there are magical girls sent flying into concrete walls bleeding profusely from having their faces smashed. There are many such examples.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No. I didn't understand the contrast here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter backstories are almost entirely given too late.\\n\r\nBackstories are mostly either given after the character has died or just before they die. We aren't given enough chance to care about many of the characters before they're killed off.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: Partially. At the rate that characters are focused on and then killed off, it makes the backstory a sort of poetic memorial, especially since they all lived differently - though if that's what this series was intentionally going for, that should have been made clearer by focusing on an overarching theme mentioning that these girls are all going to die.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are apparently-normal children in real life, but are somehow unremorseful when they kill.\\n\r\nIn particular, Swim Swim seems to be a grade-schooler in real life, yet she goes around killing the other magical girls without it seeming to bother her at all. She even participates in killing the magical girl that she admires (even after her death), on more-or-less of a whim fed to her in a dream by Nemurin.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No. This personality distinction isn't explored in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe magical girls are almost all excessively bizarre (visual character design).\\n\r\nFew of them actually look like magical girls. The rest are excessively bizarre, such as a girl in a dog costume and a girl with a large tail. There's a scantily-clad ninja and a robot too...\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No. I don't see what the motivation was behind the quirky character design. To some degree, their designs fit their personalities, but design still faltered.\\n\\n\r\nThe series genre-hops before settling on an unfitting genre.\\n\r\nIt starts off as \"Become A Magical Girl\" and \"Trapped Inside A Game\" (with a twist, because it's a layered over the real world and they can transform back to normal - although they can never fully return to being normal people), then abruptly slides into \"Unwitting Death Game\" (sub-genre \"Nonsensical Bloodbath\").\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No. The characters don't spend enough actual effort talking about and coping with the genre changes. They just superficially try to talk things out before kicking the bucket (Sister Nana especially), or too readily resort to killing, in which case they haven't examined the genre changes.\\n\\n\r\nIt turned into \"So Who's Going To Die Today?\".\\n\r\nOnce the series gets rolling, we have characters dying left and right, sometimes multiple characters per episode. At some point I had to stop mentally following any of the characters because I figured they were going to be murdered in another episode or two.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No. The story doesn't initially present itself as this - Fav just keeps lowering the survival maximum, each time to the surprise of the participants. Without mental preparation, this makes it seem that characters are being killed off arbitrarily by the author.\\n\\n\r\nThe final moments of the series attempt to bring back a weakly-explored theme.\\n\r\nAfter everything that happens, the series ends with Snow White talking about becoming a strong magical girl, since that's always been her dream - even though it's been branded as childish. She seems to somehow avoid mentioning the bloodbath that just occurred - and that was pretty important to the story.\\n\r\nOpportunity for cancel: No. The author just brushed aside the chaos and tried to pretend that it was all about a light-hearted, innocent theme all along.",

Whichever be the true purpose of this anime, she was never able to give a satisfactory explanation of the background of why the characters have tokill each other. For, even though if the situation is considered an intentional engineering, Fav and game MahoIku oversized control over the lives of the girls, so that they feel the urge to kill each other automatically becomes unrealistic. How could Fav could simply determine that they are losing theirrights as Mahou Shoujo will also automatically lose their lives? Is he some kind of god that at any time could kill anyone without having to do anything? And is not the Mahou Shoujo rivalry then began to turn serious just because there is a risk of death if they lose? Unless someday appear plausible reason why Fav and game MahoIku can freely revoke a person's life, this anime stories still seem very forced, and feel he wants to create atragic was in the end never feels real. Plus, with a storyline that drove fast, anime is also hardly gives an opportunity for any emotion to the characters grow from the dead, then is left of the story is really just a series of scenes of violence and brutal killing of a vacuum.",

            "content": "Magical Girl Raising project is a good anime, though not for the faint of heart.\r\nThe series wastes no time in giving us what we've all come for: Magical Girls killing each other. The only problem is that a lot of characters come to this conclusion rather quickly, though you can just assume that they're crazy, or at an age where they don't understand morals very well.\r\nThis series has a lot of twists, though they are usually predictable, there were some moments where I was caught off guard, particularly near the end. There are some parts that seem like their trying to be edgy, but thosemoments don't act out of character.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are really nice and would make great figures. The animation for te fight scenes is also pretty good(later). The music is also a plus for me, especially the ending theme. There is also some very good cinematography throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nAn ending can make or break a series, and I personally thought the ending was so satisfying, it felt like an ending, but it also felt like a prologue, considering the LN is still ongoing. I would take a season 2, but with how it rapped up, it was pretty good. It all depends on the sales of merchandise, as I once read, staking your series on Blu-ray/DVD sales is not a good business practice.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend this series, yes, but if you're sensitive to minor quantities of sexual harassment, off-screen parental abuse, and off-screen suicide, this show is not for you. If you're OK with these minor things and want to see a group of Magical girls kill each, then I give you my full recommendations to watch.",

Mahou shoujo could've been one of them, the story was great and really interesting and was what pulled me into watching the anime it wasn't just another cute loli magical anime that would bore me to death on the first episode, It had a bloody twist like Madoka the only thing that stopped the anime from being amazing in my eyes is how they .. hmm planned the story out\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a social game called \"The Magical Girl Raising Project\" there is a small chance that a user that plays it becomes a Magical Girl in reality, The MC is one of them. Now that we're talking about the Main Character honestly, she's a trashy MC in most of the episodes she didn't do shit , yeah she helped save people from the disaster that Calamity Mary started but that didn't really improve her character she didn't fight anyone and when Fav was talking to her about how everyone's going to target her and try to kill her she had a long ass thought deciding on whether she should buy weapons or not even though her friends DIED and she KNEW that the game is now a death match.\\n\\n\r\nWe never saw her actually \"fight\" people, she was always the one that was targeted, her ability is also a great tool to avoid her and her friends getting killed but nope she doesn't know how to fight, she just mourns whenever her friends die or when she realises that this game could actually get her killed.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said previously the problem I had with this Anime is how they planned the story out, you could never have a favourite character because everyone fucking dies, yes everyone dies except Ripple and the horrible MC they went Akame Ga Kill on all of us, even Hardgore Alice! Hardgore alice was a BAD ASS character who's ability was AMAZING  it was so ANNOYING how she died by that crazy kid. Swim Swim is  incredibly shallow we never really \"understood\" her plans when it came to the game, yeah I understand that she had the wrong person to look up to but honestly this is one PSYCHO KID in the end she killed Tama for .. ?? what reason ?? when Tama saved her ass from getting killed she decides to slit her throat.\\n\\n\r\ncool.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe art, sound, character design are all amazing the story is what made me rate it a 6 I don't mind if anyone dies, I don't care if they die too because everything happened so quickly so quick that whenever someone died it didn't bother me at all because 'I've only known that person for 1 episode they died ? Wow ! Ok.' This Anime had such a great chance of becoming a great one imo the plot as well I loved how it had that \" die in game die irl \" twist to it and a gorey twist as well the story and pacing messed that up big time. The Main Character -- Snow White was a flop pretty much even when she knew that this Magical Girl game was no longer rainbows and happiness she continued to act like it was she didn't kill anyone and she didn't get killed by anyone, honestly feels like anyone that rolled with her died for her.",

            "content": "WARNING: CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS!\r\nOh Magical Girl Raising Project, you had a ton of potential, but I can't really say I'm surprised with the end result. In my experience, I've found that a ton of survival game or battle royale series really fail to make a huge impression on me, which is a shame, because the genre itself is pretty entertaining. This series really isn't any different. \r\nIf you've watched Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Juuni Taisen, then you've already watched this anime. It's essentially nothing more than a combination of those two shows (with a little Danganronpa added in the mix). It tries to bea another new subversion to the magical girl genre, but fails to do anything meaningful. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I address the characters and the story, I want to briefly mention the animation and the sound, which were actually two pretty strong aspects of this show. The OST is pretty nice, although I really can't pick out a point that I liked aside from whenever Hardgore Alice was with Budget Madoka. The creepy undertones were a great tonal touch to the scene. The opening and ending were also executed extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't anything particularly special, but works pretty well for the show. It's not horrible, but it isn't exactly Violet Evergarden either. The character designs were also appealing to look at. They weren't necessarily creative, but they were very well executed. Of course, if Charlotte and Btooom! have taught me anything, it's never to judge an anime solely on the production value. MagiPro no doubt looks pretty, but in this case, that's all it has going for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were atrociously handled, however. You know how I said that this show was like Juuni Taisen? Not only was MagiPro a survival game, but the tried and failed method of giving a soon-to-die character a backstory became really irritating. I didn't have time to get invested in the characters because they had such a small window of time to convey any meaningful history to the audience. \\n\\n\r\nI'm fully aware that survival games involve killing; that's sort of the entire point of the show. However, this show frustrated me by killing off a good chunk of any characters that had potential to be interesting. La Pucelle, Ruler, and Magicaloid 44 had far more potential to be interesting characters than many of the girls that ended up surviving the majority of the game. Say what you will about Ruler, but at least she had some iota of intrigue. No doubt she was pompous and condescending, but she had more of a presence than many of the other girls. \\n\\n\r\nThen you also have your classic tsundere who suspiciously looked way too much like Akatsuki from Log Horizon. You have the bubbly and kind girl who loves everyone, but you really don't get to know more about her since she's the first one to meet her end. Both of the angels were obnoxiously annoying, when they really had no reason to. I also really couldn't be bothered to care about Winterprison or Sister Nana either. I thought their relationship was sweet, but that was pretty much it. \\n\\n\r\nAlso I wanted to reach through the screen and smack Tama. Her incessant whining and subservient attitude got really old after a while.\\n\\n\r\nThe antagonists were pretty weak too. Mainly because after watching this series, I still have no clue what any of their primary motives were. Cranberry, wanted to fight strong people. That's about it to her. I couldn't get a clue on what Calamity Mary wanted, aside from maybe wanting to cause mayhem. Don't even get me started on Swim Swim. If I remember correctly, then her goal was to be like Ruler. If I'm wrong, then I have absolutely no idea what the purpose behind her bloodlust was. (Being \"crazy\" is not an excuse).\\n\\n\r\nOh, and I almost forgot, the starter of the entire game, Fav, or as I like to call him, Monokyumey. If I'm being honest here, I still don't know what his purpose served. It's almost like the writers took Kyubey, and tried to make the same concept work for this knock off. There's no reason behind the bloodshed or the death in this game. At least with Madoka, Kyubey was tricking the magical girls into signing contracts with him so he could benefit his race with the deaths of them. With Fav, it seems that the only motive is to satisfy his own desire for blood. Now normally, this approach for a character isn't necessarily bad. I still think that Tatsumi from Shiki fueled the actions of the other vampires with his nihilistic lust for violence. His sadism makes sense in the context of his respective story. However, with Fav, there really seems to be no motive behind him, other than seeing cute girls die. He mentions the magical world, and the Magical Girl Raising Project, but nowhere do we get any indication that there's someone behind the scenes pulling his strings. Sure we find out that Cranberry was the mastermind behind this game, but there's really nothing more than that. They were just cruddy and uninspired villains.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, we have our protagonist, if you can even call her that, Snow White, or Budget Madoka. Of all of the anime I've seen so far, she may be one of the worst protagonists I've ever seen. Not because she's a bad person, she's just a horrible character. You rarely see her throughout the entire run of the show, and when she's in camera shot, she does practically nothing. Fav literally states in the last episode that Budget Madoka never even had to get her hands dirty. I've made my distaste for Future Diary and its main character (among others) known, but at least Yuki had some semblance of a personality or drive. Yes, I'm actually using Yuki as a POSITIVE example here. I know that I have to suspend my disbelief whenever I watch fiction, but MagiPro made it really difficult for me to keep that suspension. There's just no realistic way Snow White would have ever survived this game.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character that didn't bother me was Top Speed, but again she got such a small amount of history that even then, I find it hard to connect to her character.\\n\\n\r\nThe story ultimately becomes extremely convoluted. The first episode had promise, but after finishing, I'm left with more questions than when I started. What exactly is the magic world? The only thing we know about it is that it exists. We don't know if it's an alternate dimension or a separate planet, we don't know about who lives there, we don't know the purpose behind the Magical Girl Raising Project at all. Since if there's a world inhabited by magical girls, then what would be the purpose behind the project?\\n\\n\r\nHow are the magical girls chosen? Is it at random? I find that relatively hard to believe considering a pair of twin sisters were chosen. Is it based on merit? Well then that would rule out Calamity Mary, who was nothing more than a drunkard who abused her daughter. The method on how they're chosen is never really specified. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, what was the entire purpose behind the deaths? Kyubeykuma mentioned that other magical girls were chosen by defeating a monster or doing good deeds, so why did it suddenly change to a death game? I refuse to accept that there aren't other forces beyond Cranberry and Fav that determine how the games play out. Something had to have created Fav, and that something or someone had to have access to other worlds. It just makes no realistic sense for someone to change from pacifistic methods to ones that end in bloodshed. Fav mentions that if he doesn't find another master, that he'll be in trouble. Why is this the case? Hell if I know, and it looks like we won't be receiving another season any time soon. I could be wrong since the manga is still in production, but as of recent news, this is all we have.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted to like MagiPro, I really did. The show definitely has its merits, but the numerous plotholes and shallow characters overshadow them significantly. \\n",

Not every character in the show is strong, and some of the weaker characters get to the very end. Some of the characters get focus too short to be satisfying, which is mostly a problem of running so short a season.\r\nMy recommendation to get anything out of this show is to go in with a group of friends and entertain each other. The show does work better the more appreciation you have for the genre and the inspirations some of the aspects of the show draws from. However, theMahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku doesn't have very much it actually wants to tell you about what it thinks of the genre. There is definitely some fun to be had; while the art direction may not be my favorite, the animation and the action is very well thought out. That aside, there is not actually very much for you to take away from the show.\\n\\n\r\nMagical Girls Raising Project is easily understood how enjoyable it can be with strong ideas and good animation, but it's not the easiest thing to enjoy.",

End up become laughing stock.\r\nArt : I dont mind with the art. Everything in the series look OK. It just work for the series.\r\nSound : Also nothing worth to mention here. It OK. It just work.\r\nCharacter : The standard unlikable MC usually end up become likeable orat least bearable. But not in this series. But usually there is one or two good side character? Also not in this series. The other character in the series doesnt help the story. All the character feel one/two dimensional. \\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment : Yes, At least on first 3/4 episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : It was MEH series with good 1st impression.\\n",

            "content": "Within the first episode this show seemed to have a lot of potential. This show turned out to be a waste. I had dropped it for 6 months because of how much of a disappointment it turned out to be. There are several issues, first one being the lack of character development. I had zero vested interest in any of the characters. Why? Because there was no development. It was only after they died, there was maybe 5 minutes showing their story. In all honesty, that was my biggest issue with this show . It is a 12 episode show that introduces too many characterswithout time to build up each one. \\n\r\nSecond issue that really got to me was the lack of care in the animation. The biggest one is when Swim-Swim is searching for Cranberry. Cranberry pokes out from behind the trees as if the show was a comedy. \\n\r\nAnd lastly, the main character. The entire show, 99.99% of it all she does is cry and say \"stop fighting\". She was developed as if she was suppose to be the savior, but spends the entire show doing absolutely nothing. \\n\\n\r\nThe one good thing I will give this show is the violence and gore. But at the same time the deaths are very anticlimactic. \\n\r\nWould I recommend this to anyone? No. It would not even cross my mind. However if you have spare time and NOTHING else to watch, then I guess go to this.",

            "content": "It is no surprise to see one anime now and then defying the usual tropes. Puella Magi Madoka Magica for example challenged the trope by giving a mahou shoujo anime a darker turn while some other brings a little twist by having the protagonist mahou shoujo as an adult male; mahou shounen. Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku, or Magical Girl Raising Project is leaned towards the former, with its own unique twist.\r\nwarning: might have some obvious spoiler.\r\nThe anime start off with a rather cheerful and happy tone, typical of  a mahou shoujo anime. Things take a darker turn 2-3 episodes later, as the rule tookturn for the worse, in the end become a huge battle royale between the mahou shoujos. Some formed team; to defend themselves or picking on weaker groups. Thing is, more than half of the cast had some screw loose in their head. There are no concrete explanation as in why they have to result to murder, since alternatively they could talk through it. Some do it just for fun, some just following orders while this one girl cold heartedly just kill every other girl, devoid of good enough reasons. While this is all just to push the plot and to make a darker show of mahou shoujo series, it is indeed rather disheartening to see your favourite girls die one by one each episodes. Conversely, this show does breed some of the most hated character this season. Most of the death is foreshadowed in a way that most of them shows a little flashback of the characters backstory before they meet their demise, while some other is rather unexpected in term of how they would die regardless. The story went full on battle royale till the end, with a decent closure. The drama aspect of the anime itself felt really forced, to the point that they dragged on too much. While overall it is actually a prologue to a much longer light novel series, it is mediocre enough to be adapted as one.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters in the story is Snow White, an ideal representative of how Magical Girl should be; cheerful, always happy to help other and disliked conflicts. She had a rather useless looking ability (in term of combat at least, well not yet fully developed at this point) in a way she could hear the voice of distress of other people. The only problem with her is that she is mostly useless for most of the story itself. She haven't done much to actually influence all the other magical girl, in which her absence could brings little to no different to the outcome of the story. She is there mostly as a symbol of pure mahou shoujo; the only one existed amidst the conflict brewing. The other main character is Ripple, also have little backstory to show behind her. She is a quiet ninja+mahou shoujo, with her action in the beginning driven only by her mentor, Top Speed. Other characters are not so really worth mentioning, since they are there only to have little backstory to tell before they actually die. And yeah, Swim Swim in particular; my hate for her is more than the force of thousand suns burning.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is good in general. The quality is mostly consistent with little to no animation problem. The shift in art and mood from a bright, cheerful tone to a muck dark, less vibrant colour is a nice touch to emphasize the central theme of the anime itself. The use of special effects along with the determination and fear on most girls\u2019 faces while fighting were well displayed. The sound overall nothing special, mostly mediocre. The OP and ED both had a not so cheerful tune, directly implies to the viewer that this is not your average, happy go lucky mahou shoujou anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Mahou Shoujo Ikusei Keikaku is a rather decent enough anime to watch. It is an anime for those who enjoy a series who deviate from your usual trope, which is apparently rather popular nowadays. If you are a fan of cute girls battling each other only to end up in a gruesome death every single episode, then your are more than welcome to watch this anime.\\n",

            "content": "I gotta say I was really hoping for a lot more from this anime\r\nI first heard of this anime a while ago, heard it was going to be a Magical Girl Death Battle anime, well that was about 75% correct, it has a lot of magical girls, a lot of death, but not a lot of Battling. \r\nThe characters of this anime are probably the best thing of it, it created a large cast of characters that were all distinct from each other based on their powers, and all had different backstories. One of the best things about this series is that because of theway the magical girls were selected there happened to be a lot of variety in the people, instead of most magical girl animes which just have a bunch of high school girls. Pon was probably the worst though, I feel like he was trying to pull off a Madoka Magica and be Kubye but he just wasn't nearly as funny or villainous as him.\\n\r\nThe reason I say there isn't very much Battling in this anime is because almost all the \"Battles\" are over in a few seconds, and most of the time the result is pretty disappointing, sometimes feeling like the only reason a character lost is because the plot wanted a different character to win.\\n\r\nIt doesn't bring much new to the table in terms of magical girl anime. It follows pretty much the same formula of other ones, recruit the cast, shock the audience with something, kill off the cast, reveal evil mascots true intentions, overcome evil mascot, end on a somewhat high note. Im not going to spoil who walks out of this anime alive but it sure isn't who i expected (Tears*Magicaloid 44). The shock didn't really surprise me tho, since i think everyone walking into this anime knew it was supposed to be a death battle anime. So if you're looking for an anime with happy characters, or a main character that does anything else then cry every time she is on screen, turn away now, its not going to be for you.\\n\r\n6/10, As the saying goes, you either Sink or Swim(Swim)",

I simply wanted to make a parable between this show and one of the Fate routes.  Heaven's Feel, the 3rd Fate route is described as being about \"The friction between real and ideal\".  I think this sums up Magical Girl Raising Project perfectly.  Snow White, the main character, believes magical girls must be pure, kind-hearted, and exist to help others.  She is blindingly sweet compared to mostof the other characters, and is traumatized of the course of the series.  Snow White's ideal of magical girls conflicts with the reality of the rest of the characters and the trials.  All of the other characters are flawed, imperfect humans-a few of which have been through traumatic events like bullying and sexual abuse.  Over the course of the story, Snow White comes to realize that her ideal is nothing more than an ideal, and that sometimes, reality is cruel.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all however, I thought this show was an average show, so I gave it a 6.

So if you didn\u2019t like either of those series, this is not the series for you. And it delivers on what it promises, magical girls pitted against each other in a game of death. The characters are diverse and varied each with their own motivations & story. If I wanted to be objective I could point out flaws like lack of character development or actual storytelling, but why bother? This show offered me a game of death between magical girls. That\u2019swhat it offered, that\u2019s what i signed up for, that\u2019s what i got; and was not disappointed. Because I didn\u2019t go into this series with any expectations or prejudices I was able to enjoy it to the fullest. The action was intense, the emotion was gripping, the art was cool. It\u2019s simple, and being simple makes entertaining. It doesn\u2019t try to be greater than the sum of its parts. By offering a simple premise and sticking to it, they produced one of the best anime of the year. I say watch it, unless you need to to get to know characters and go on hundred episode journeys together.\\n",

Girls are cute, but the setting doesn't make use of its vibrant colors in favor of keeping to the tone of the story.  The characters are pretty good!  A couple of them are shallow, but they tried their hardest to give us subtle clues into everyone's personalities.\r\nThis show has it's edge-factor turned up pretty high.  It reminds me most of Akame ga Kill in how they treat character death, but unlike Akame ga Kill there aren't any huge plot holesthat ruin the story and most of the characters are a lot more watchable.  \\n\\n\r\nWould recommend to most people\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler Free\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThere is nothing really new here.  Elements of death-game, elements of magical girl, and lots of edge.  There are a couple of good story beats that made watching it more engaging, but for the most part you can easily predict a lot of the twists of the story, especially when the show starts to get into its rhythm of exposition-to-plot-point.\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\r\nThe girls are, for the most part, cute.  A lot of blood and blood smears that are just whatever.  I know a good amount of people will enjoy a show if it shows more blood but it doesn't really do anything for this show.  By far the worst part of the art is how the majority of the show is set in the night, and therefore most of the show has a dark color palette that fits the tone, but isn't very pretty to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nReally didn't do anything for me.  It was ok but forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nA big cast of characters that vary on the spectrum of realism and depth.  Many of the girls only get a very shallow explanation of their lives and their reasons for being magical girls, literally some of them are \"I am evil and I want to do bad things.\"  That being said, this show does do a lot of visual storytelling and doesn't just feed you its character traits, which I very much appreciated.  I felt the most enjoyment from watching the main girl, but sadly she takes a back seat during a lot of the story while she influences other magical girls.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\n....\\n\\n",
