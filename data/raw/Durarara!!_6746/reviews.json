            "content": "This anime is... for lack of a better term, the most freaking amazing thing I've ever seen. At first I was a bit worried, since I usually hate anime with the whole gang war theme and all, not to mention the first episode was a little bit slow, as well as the whole 'headless rider' seemed a bit silly. The characters (namely Izaya, Shizuo, Celty, Shinra... hell, all of the,) were what got me. Even the protagonist, who may seem like an average, boring male protagonist had some of his own secrets. But I'll explain in detail.\r\nStory: Like I said, I had my doubts, butwhen it started actually revealing itself, the blend of the modern and fantastical and sci fi ended up blending perfectly. With the whole Dullahan concept, the mythology, in addition to the Slasher, plus the modern-ness of it being set in a big city, as well as the Namie plotline in the beginning... It may seem like those would clash a lot, but they really don't. There's a fair bit of action in it, but nothing overwhelming to make it be called an action anime for me. LOTS AND LOTS of plot twists, but it keeps you surprised even to the end, and keeps you interested in what's going to happen next. Not predictable.. at all. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Not much to say, I really liked the animation of it. It's quite refreshing and smooth compared to the Naruto and the Bleach type of animation; it's different and the city was animated beautifully. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: I adored the music in this anime, although I felt that the soundtrack could be a bit more diverse. You'll hear the same themes and songs a lot, but so far (And I've rewatched this about 6 times) I still enjoy listening to the music. The openings and endings are epic as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The most intriguing and amazing part of this anime, by far. It starts out with Mikado, who, though he may seem like the generic awkward male protagonist, has his own secrets that will shock you. His friend, Kida, is one of my favourites... he's adorable, first of all, although he also has lots of his own secrets and he'll surprise you... a lot. Anri gets kind of annoying since a lot of the plot is centered around her, but I actually did come to respect her once her character was really revealed. Izaya is my favourite, though. He pulls the strings with everyone... even in the beginning, he's introduced as a psycopath with no concern for other humans, although he loves them. His constant messing with peoples heads and being an awful person to everyone.. was just hilarious a lot of the time, especially since he does random adorable things like when he was walking next to Celty on her motorcycle and was all \"Vroom Vroom! Vrrrrrroom!\" But he also brings up psycological issues and concepts during the show, which actually make you think-- which is just amazing in an anime, and very rare usually. Shizuo I adored as well. He's mostly a comic relief character, since he's always being violent and hitting people with street signs even though he claims to hate violence.. yeahhh. Celty.. the other main female protagonist. I actually love her. Usually I hate female protagonists as a rule, but her character is complex without being overly tragic, and she's a genuinely good person without being all annoying and motivating. Shinra is just adorable with her, although he's does have his own faults and he isn't perfect. He's still adorable. That's it for major characters, but overall... they're just  epic. Even though they may seem like stereotypes at first glance, none of them are what they seem. Even the minor characters provide just enough comic relief (and anime references) to keep the show happy, but still have a serious undertone. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were all just amazing as well, they brought it to life beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: ...I've watched it 6 times within like, 3 weeks. I never got tired of the characters. Although it is a bit repetitive, the way it goes episode to episode explaining in detail what's going on from another perspective, that's one of my favourite parts about it; the way the story progresses from more than one perspective. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: This is by far the best anime I've ever seen, I'd recommend it to anyone, no matter what their tastes are, since it has a bit of everything and an excellent cast of characters.",

            "content": "I finally finished \"Durarara!!\" and while there were characters that I liked and moments that were entertaining, I don't think it's a series I would willingly put myself through again. I'm not even sure I liked it as a whole.\r\nPutting aside the immediately obvious fact that the animation for this series is superb and all opening and ending songs are awesome, what's left for me to complain about is the pacing, the plot, and the nearly nonexistent character development. Oh, and the mind-numbingly boring way in which the dialogue is remarkably unsubtle, anvilicious, and pretentious.\r\nI know this is based on a series of light novelsand that there's also a manga version. But while I know a bit about both, I haven't read enough of either, and this is an anime review anyway, so I'm glad I haven't yet so I can focus on the anime. I actually wonder if I may be too old for this anime, because it left me completely unimpressed, didn't change my point of view in anyway, and I learned nothing and felt nothing while I watched it. It felt like the entire thing was made by a bunch of disaffected college students that have nothing better to do with their spare time than angst about how the world is so sad and boring. And while this seems perhaps an unfair attack on the team that made the anime and for all I know they're completely the opposite, it's how the series came off as.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the darkness or apparent maturity of the themes, the show comes off as incredibly naive. The characters spend way too long and talk too much in an effort to explain themselves and their actions. There's too much talking! Even when what they're saying is plainly obvious or when they could have stopped after one sentence and it's especially annoying when you realize that their justifications are pretty much senseless or stupid after the nth time they've explained it. I honestly blocked out whole chunks of dialogue from boredom. Then I went back to see if I missed anything by doing so. I didn't.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think the series is as meaningful as it thinks it is, and I wasn't moved by most of the characters. The only ones I really cared about by the end of it all was Kida Masaomi and Celty, the headless biker. (And Heiwajima Shizuo who is crazy awesome. I like Orihara Izaya and he's one of my favorite characters, but I don't really care or am concerned about the guy because he should honestly die in a fire.) Speaking of which, what really bothered me was how so many of the characters escaped karma -- except Kida Masaomi, who the show seemed determined to break because that's his designated role. The show also tries to present Mikado Ryuugamine as somewhat of a hero, which I refuse to accept. And to bring up the manga and novels, I think the anime tries much harder than those two make him likeable or acceptable (and overall NICER) to count as one and it's obvious. I'm sorry, but no. Better to have left him a bit of a magnificent bastard than to do so. By extension, the Dollars are supposed to be the good gang, which is laughable, since while they do some good in the anime, they're not much different from the bad gangs -- they're a bunch of easily manipulated cowardly sheep who can't even do good on their own (with the exception of a few, but they're in the extended hero's group so...).\\n\\n\r\nWhat really bothers me about the Dollars is, had their leader been actually smarter and less interested in his own entertainment, they could have PUT AWAY SOMEONE THAT'S DONE SOMETHING CLEARLY WRONG. In the first half, the major conflict involved a shady pharmaceutical company responsible for a string of kidnappings and that was covering up an assault. Granted, the assaulted girl was cray cray and a stalker, and she didn't press charges because she's madly in love with the guy that nearly killed her and they wound up together thanks to the said pharmaceutical company, but really? REALLY? The guy that ALMOST CRACKED HER HEAD OPEN escaped punishment and is later on referred to as \"he's weird, but kind of cool\"? By the show's protagonist? WHAT?! And what did the leader of the Dollars choose to do about this? MESS WITH THE MIND OF THE PERSON BEHIND ALL OF IT. Yeah, that's all. And the result? Was not so awful that by the next episode she's seen working for the information broker that orchestrated it all while still full of haughty arrogance. And speaking of the information broker, I don't know if he really is just that awesome or the other characters are just so stupid or weak that he's pretty much untouchable despite being so plainly evil.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that could have possibly redeemed this whole show was the friendship between the three main characters (Anri, Mikado, and Kida). But as a friendship, it just fails. There are countless other anime and manga that have portrayed friendship in an amazingly poignant way. This anime had that chance but it just fell so miserably short.\\n\\n\r\nThe light novels and the manga version of this show goes farther from what I've seen and heard about. If there's a second season, my point of view might change.  Who knows? As it stands, it's pointless, other than being pretty to look at. Much of the show seems focused on being cool for the sake of being cool and that's it.",

            "content": "Durarara; a review.\r\nI would like to note the massive popularity this show commands, and the rabid nature of its fanbase. Normally, this would be a good enough reason for one to abstain from critically reviewing this show, but oh, the thrill of jabbing at the hornets' nest...\r\nLet us commence.\r\nRound One: The Stage.\r\nAlright, this one is going to be a mess, and I should get this over with in the first bit of the review. Durarara does not have a plot. It has barely any backstory, and relies more on the established 'Rule of Cool' rather than an interesting story or an intricate plot, or evenjust the premise of complete pandemonium that made its predecessor 'Baccano!' such a phenomenal success. However, that is not to say that Durarara has nothing to offer in this field. \\n\\n\r\nJust like its predecessor 'Baccano!', Durarara does not rely on a dominant and omnipresent central plot, but rather on the characters, although it does try to give a certain amount of depth to the stage, and this is where it fails. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, you can put up a decent enough play without equipping your stage with crimson curtains and whatnot, and instead focusing on your cast. Should you succeed in the latter, it might still be an extremely enjoyable presentation. If you to divert your attention to the stage itself for a slight, change your mind, and leave it there will certainly result in a spectacular failure on both sides. \\n\\n\r\n'Durarara!' is set in Ikebukuro, one of the more dangerous urban neighborhoods in Japan. The neighbourhood plays host to all of Durarara's resident checkpoints on the unwritten list of anime stereotypes. The story takes place in the aftermath of a gang war that is only known as 'The color gang war', something we find out close to nothing (interesting) about. This was a miserable failure at adding depth to a stage, and is where it falls short. \\n\\n\r\nFor a rating, I'm going to have to give this section a 4 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRound Two: The Cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe collection of Ikebukuro's occupants who partake in the story of Durarara! isn't exceptional in any sense.\\n\\n\r\nYou have Mikado Ryugamine; a country bumpkin who's moved into this wild urban district to-\\n\r\nYes, go to high school\u2026\\n\\n\r\nCross out 'Well-endowed class representative' (with a deep, dark secret that you will not give two Kusos for) and 'Pervert best friend' on the aforementioned list of anime stereoty- Oh, I know! Let's do something that has NOT been done to death in the world of Anime; put 'em in a love triangle! \\n\\n\r\nThen, you have your filler material. Enter; \\n\r\n - The Otakus. \\n\\n\r\n - The walking sack of anger issues that tosses weighty objects at anybody who looks sideways at him (CRISPIN FREEMAN!)\\n\\n\r\n - His sworn foe, the 'Smart guy' with an affinity for slick combat (knives and evasion)\\n\\n\r\n - The immigrant (they emphasize upon that to a degree that borders on racism) African-Russian sushi-bar worker.\\n\\n\r\n All of the characters above get absolutely no development. Their introductions are rather bland, and their hastily added origin stories are almost cringeworthy. The most they receive are shallow labels which do little more than make sure you don't mix them up.\\n\\n\r\nBut enter a pleasant surprise; there is an ace in this chaotic mess of a deck, and that would be Celty Sturlurson.\\n\\n\r\nCelty is a Dulahan, the celtic equivalent of the grim reaper, a being with a dismembered head that guides souls into the afterlife. However, Celty differs from other Dulahan as she is missing her head, and is in the process of searching for it. She is the only standout character amongst this ocean of cardboard cutouts, alongside Shinra, whom she shares an\u2026 Unusual relationship with. Watching this is, quite frankly, is thrice as interesting as the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf I could change this show (and good lord, do I wish it to be so), I would focus on what the show is really about; Celty. The other characters only serve to detract from her story, and the focus is on the worst possible group. \\n\\n\r\nThis aspect of the show, in my opinion, gets a rating of 6 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRound Three: The Sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is where this show really picks itself up, with some funk and jazz, and a very Baccano-esque initial opening theme (both in terms of animation and sound) that I thoroughly enjoyed. There's even a couple of unconventional but compelling tracks with solo upright bass that I particularly appreciated. In this respect, the show follows in the footsteps of Baccano, and the results are remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nWith two solid dubs and a great score, I see no reason why it doesn't merit a 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRound Four: The Animation.\\n\\n\r\nI'll have to concede that the animation for the show isn't all that bad, and it even has an appreciable organic vibe to it. However, at times this doesn't shine where it needs to, and I can even recall scenes where the average animation quality detracted from the show itself. As is evident, there is no worse sin that the art of a show can possibly commit. For shows that follow the previously mentioned 'Rule of Cool', the animation requires a certain emphasis which this show doesn't seem to have.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation scores a 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRound Five: Entertainment Value.\\n\\n\r\nI might appear to be dissatisfied during the course of my this review, but when I watched the series, I found that I was rather enjoying it, and would watched a slew of episodes in a single setting. It would be abject dishonesty to say that it wasn't enjoyable initially, but following the first few episodes, I found it was becoming boring rather quickly, and all of the aforementioned flaws became painfully apparent. Some were prominent enough to serve as immediate deterrents, but its merits were just enough to counteract them when they received attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe score for entertainment value is a 6 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall score for this series will be determined by the average of the above scores, which is a 6.4 out of 10, rounded off to 6 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nAs for an alternative, I would recommend Baccano, which is the spiritual predecessor to this series, and does everything a whole lot better, and I can say this despite not having completed the series yet (which is a very good sign). Also, most of Baccano is set about a century before Durarara, with certain parts in the 18th and early 21st centuries, so if that strikes your fancy, it's definitely a show you will like.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The world of anime never ceases to come up with new and fascinating series, original and interesting storylines, or iconic and highly memorable characters. There\u2019s a reason why this form of entertainment (and art) has attained such widespread reach over the years, and I truly believe that its decisive power lies in the near unrestrained creativity present in each and every anime series, original video animation, and whatnot. This freedom of expression and imagination has become somewhat of a signature for the Japanese animation industry, acting as sort of an assurance that anime features plenty of exclusive elements and things you won\u2019t get to seeanywhere else. Sometimes that can be a bad thing (if you know what I\u2019m saying), but let\u2019s face it, most of the time that\u2019s undeniably beneficial to both the creators and the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nA recent anime series, entitled Durarara!!, is a perfect demonstration of what the Japanese animation industry is capable of and the benefits of its broader range of creativity. Stretching over twenty-four episodes (not taking into account any possible OVAs or specials), Durarara!! tells a wonderfully unique story set in the Ikebukuro district of Tokyo, Japan. Dealing with themes such as friendship, betrayal, gang wars, the urban lifestyle, identity and the lack thereof, consumerism, and even the supernatural, its storyline is beautifully complex, surprisingly comprehensive as a whole, and features several intertwining story arcs that blend together in an impressive manner.\\n\\n\r\nDurarara!! starts off with the teenager Mikado Ryugamine and his arrival in Tokyo, where he is greeted by his childhood friend Masaomi Kida, who has lived in the city for several years now. Mikado has longed for a big city life ever since he was young, and was newly convinced by Masaomi to transfer to his current high school in Japan\u2019s capital, Tokyo. During their childhood, the two have been best friends up until Masaomi moved away, and have kept in touch through the internet ever since then. As they finally meet again in one of the biggest cities in the world, Masaomi wastes little time with catching up and immediately proceeds to show the timid Mikado around Ikebukuro. However, Mikado, still overwhelmed by the intimidating urban lifestyle prevailing throughout Tokyo, is even more stunned after realizing just how many secrets and mysteries this city actually holds.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Masaomi shows Mikado around the city, he also introduces him to a bunch of people, some friends of his, others not so much, something which can be seen as an act of setting up the exposition upon which the rest of the series will depend. Durarara!! features a lot of characters and every episode follows more than a single plotline, so it may take a while to become comfortable with the occasionally frantic pace and often perplexing storyline prevailing throughout the series, though once the first impressions settle in, it all becomes a very exciting and interesting ride, thanks to the various fascinating elements making up the story as the anime progresses.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier on, Durarara!! is a series that is very rich in characters and story arcs. As far as the protagonist goes, Mikado Ryugamine would be the obvious pick, though under the surface, things are a little more complicated than that. The first few episodes definitely focus on Mikado for the most part, developing him as a lead character and also using him as a means of constructing the exposition of the series. Once things are in place, a great deal of characters that were previously introduced come into play and several story arcs begin to take shape. On one side, there\u2019s the group of high school friends consisting of the above mentioned Mikado Ryugamine, his longtime buddy Masaomi Kida, and the voluptuous, introverted and often shy Anri Sonohara. There\u2019s an interesting, though perhaps somewhat clich\u00e9d dynamic going on between the three of them, and the full extent of their common bond only emerges towards the finale.\\n\\n\r\nAnother set of characters come into focus a little further down the line, some of the more noteworthy consisting of Shizuo Heiwajima, a bodyguard wearing a bartender\u2019s uniform and sunglasses who is widely known around Ikebukuro as the strongest man in the world, Izaya Orihara, a young and enigmatic information dealer who seems to manipulate other people for his own enjoyment\u2014he\u2019s also Shizuo\u2019s sworn enemy, and last but definitely not least, a mysterious motorcyclist known as the black rider who is often seen driving around Ikebukuro for unknown reasons\u2014rumours have it that the rider is actually headless, an allusion to the legend of the headless horseman. These are only but a few of all the characters appearing in the series, giving you sort of an idea of how expansive the world of Durarara!! is, even though the entire anime takes place in one common location: the Ikebukuro district of Tokyo.\\n\\n\r\nAs impressive as Durarara!! is on a narrative level, it also excels in the visual and sound departments. The art and animation of the series is thoroughly impressive, giving each particular character a unique appearance that contributes to making an impression on the viewer. The city of Tokyo is beautifully portrayed, and Ikebukuro is drawn in a way that gives it a special urban atmosphere, with particular attention given to the nightlife, which truly vibrates amidst the glow of streetlights and hidden secrets. Durarara!! features an art style that is a little different from the usual anime series, meaning that characters are a little more rich in detail, have a slightly different build and their specific facial traits are more accentuated. What that means is that it may take a while for some viewers to get used to this particular style, though ultimately, it fits the overall feeling of the series well.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is also complemented by solid voice acting and a very impressive and memorable soundtrack, constituting a vigorous and upbeat opening track during the first half of the show and a very evocative and somewhat melancholic one during the other half. Both songs work well and are especially catchy, never seeming to get old, even after twelve episodes have passed. Unfortunately, the two songs played during the ending sequence of the episodes are a little underwhelming and definitely do not measure up to the standards set by the ones playing during the introductory section, but that\u2019s just a small complaint, because the music tracks are still quite fitting, meaning that the mood prevailing throughout the show is never ruined.\\n\\n\r\nAs good of an anime series as Durarara!! is, it still exhibits a fair amount of flaws and imperfections along the way. The narrative power and expansiveness of the show has proved to be its strongest suit, but it has also made way to a few inconsistencies in the flow of the story, as well as a couple of unresolved plot points that have garnered over the course of the series\u2019 running time. The ending of Durarara!! feels pretty rushed, a common shortcoming among many other anime series, which will surely anger some viewers, especially considering the time the show spent on developing certain characters and plot elements. It definitely could have used one or two more episodes to properly conclude things, if you ask me. Here\u2019s to hoping that a second season will be made in the future\u2014however unlikely\u2014that will sort out some of these unresolved issues.\\n\\n\r\nIts rushed finale and partially unfinished storyline aside, Durarara!! is an excellent anime series that is unique enough and boasts plenty of originality so as to make it one of the best show of the year. It\u2019s definitely the most well-written series in a significant amount of time, featuring thoroughly intriguing characters and engaging story arcs. The way everything intertwines and relates to each other during the course of the story is quite fascinating and it\u2019s definitely interesting to see how things unfold in the end. Personally, seeing Durarara!! nail the look and feel of an urban lifestyle and depict the city of Tokyo in such a gorgeous way has sealed the deal for me, though I\u2019m sure others will find plenty of diverse things to hold on to while on a ride through the mysterious Ikebukuro.",

            "content": "From the very get-go, even from the opening title sequence, you can easily notice one thing about Durarara, and that is that it was made by Ryohgo Narita, creator of Baccano. Everything about this show besides the setting is very reminiscent of Baccano, so inevitably, it will be compared to it. So, how does DRRR hold up compared to Narita's previous work?\r\nWell, let's just get this out of the way now: No, it isn't as good as Baccano - but then, few anime are. If you're a Baccano fan, Durarara is definitely worth watching, and even if you aren't a Baccano fan, Durarara is stillworth watching, although some of the references may be lost on you, seeing as how Baccano and Durarara take place in the same fictional universe. The main difference between the two is, perhaps bizarrely given their setting, Durarara is clearly the more mature of the two series. It opts for a darker, big city underworld chic as opposed to the vibrant 30's style of Baccano. A lot of it revolves around mystery, an element not present in its predecessor.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot of Durarara is hard to sum up briefly, the premise revolves largely around Celty Sturluson, a Dullahan (read: Headless Horseman) who has lost her head, and come to Japan in search, posing as a biker. At the same time, highschool student Mikado Ryugamine is moving to Ikebokuro, after growing tired of his life in the countryside, and meets up with his internet buddy Masaomi Kida. Kida is quick to warn Mikado of the colour gangs that roam Ikebokuro, such as the Yellow Scarves and Blue Square, as well as the mysterious \"DOLLARS\", a gang claiming to be colourless. The two of them soon befriend a shy, withdrawn girl named Anri Sonohara. But as the plor develops, it becomes clear that none of these people are as simple as they seem.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the strengths of this show is the characters. Near enough every major character, and even some of the minor ones, are fascinating and distinctive characters. Celty is considered fearsome by many, though is immediately likeable and down to earth in person. Shizuo Heiwajima is an inhumanly strong man who hates violence, but is filled to the brim with unstoppable rage. Izaya Orihara is a crafty information broker who has a fondness for deranged chess motifs and knives. Shinra Kishitani is a quirky underground surgeon who has a loveably flirtatious fascination with Celty, and even minor characters like a gang of otaku who practise torture based on anime and manga add a comedic referential streak to the series, so if you're a fan of Spice and Wolf, Railgun, Dokuro-chan or Kino's Journey, expect a few giggles.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst the show is initially good, it doesn't really pick up until around a third of the way in, when it begins to move into the fast-paced action that Baccano performed to wonderfully. For most of the middle third of the series, the show is absolutely on its peak, keeping you absolutely glued to your seat wondering what will happen next. It skillfully runs through plots of Celty's missing head, a mysterious slasher attacking people, the background of the wars between the colour gangs, a medical organisation performing human experimentation, and people controlling everything from behind the scenes...\\n\\n\r\nBut as great as all of this sounds, in the third act, everything begins to fall apart. Once the slasher arc is over, most of the other plot threads are abandoned, and everything winds up revolving around the a gang war, which is a considerably weaker plot thread than the others, and at it's worst devolves into soap opera drama caused entirely by foolish decisions that could easily have been avoided. This would've at least stood up strongly if it had kept skillfully using the other storylines, but the plot of Celty's head is completely and utterly ignored as a result of this massive plot tumour. All of this builds up to an anticlimactic and lacklustre ending that gives very little closure whatsoever. The upcoming specials are set to wrap this up, but I really don't consider that a valid excuse. The only way this would be forgiveable is if there was a second season, and by the way that the specials were announced, this seems unlikely.\\n\\n\r\n(EDIT: Future seasons have rectified this dangling plot thread, but considering how much worse the later seasons were I still can't forgive it for this.)\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: At it's best, absolutely fantastic. Shame it went to waste.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: 7/10\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 7/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Baccano, Boogiepop Phantom.",

            "content": "Durarara!! is one of those shows with a double life theme, add that with some gang drama and a headless motorcyclist, and you got yourself a mashup! Which is exactly what this is. A mashup. \r\nStory: \r\nJust what I said above. This is a mashup of different cliche or used ideas. The headless motorcyclist, the gangs and mobs, the secret double life of a high schooler, and two best friends who end being on the opposite end. I was a bit disappointed in the fact there was much at the beginning but silly introductions to the characters and their profile. I don't care! They could'veeasily done the same thing while they moved through the plot. And it was a bit hard to understand why this was considered \"supernatural\" minus Shizuo having extreme strength. \\n\\n\r\nIt was decent enough, but still had so much potential.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nNot very good. Why do some of the people on the streets end up being just grey silhouettes? Now I haven't read the manga, so I don't know what the drawings look like, but the animation just seems so...sloppy. It looks like the animators got super lazy and said fuck it! Good enough. Heck! They look like they worked more on the background than the actually characters!  \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nProbably what saved this anime. The sounds in this were pretty good. They added to the suspension of the scene and drew the watcher in. The two opening songs were spot on and prepared the watcher for what was too come. Kudos to the soundtrack team! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say really. These characters are pretty much based off of other characters from classics, although they are pretty well thought up and they do have their own personality. No sterotypes, although Mikado was a bit of a goody too shoes. My favourite had to be Shizuo of course. The way he got when Izaya came around was hilarious! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: \\n\\n\r\n50th anime watched! I really didn't get into this until around episode 17/18. The first few episodes were a bit too dull for my taste. It seemed to be repeating itself over and over...I got bored. No lies. \\n\\n\r\nI give this 52.5% on the fighting level.\\n\\n",

You rarely even regret it afterwards (let me stress the case is somewhat different with other forms of art, like literature, which is perceived somewhat slower and more methodical).\r\nAs for Durarara, and for my most beloved songs, novels, and other works, the key is an immediate impact andan impression that lingers. \\n\\n\r\nSure, what I have written so far only has to do with personal preferences. \\n\r\nBut if I would want to convince you to watch Durarara disregarding my own taste (and I really want to convince people!), I wouldn't have a clue which aspects of this anime to present before you with persuasive intents, because I like it as a fully accomplished work of art in which there is good music, well-developed characters, snappy plot, etc.\\n\\n\r\nWell aware that I am praising an anime which is yet to be completed (thus I feel reluctant to go into details such as animation and environments) I figured, why not simply say: try it and see for yourselves that I am right!

            "content": "I recently watched the popular show, Durarararararara!! and I have to say, it was quite enjoyable, with a few flaws/annoying parts. Durarara is a very unique show that contains a whole lot of different genres mixed together; romance, comedy, supernatural, mystery, and even some action here and there. I've never seen a show hop around all over the place, in terms of plot. In this review, I may blab nonsense, but I'll try to explain why I like Durarara.\r\nIn order for me to describe the plot, it would take forever because there's just so much happening in Durarara to a whole load of different maincharacters. So I'll sum it up using Mikado Ryugamine (mainest of the main characters, I think) as the focal point. Mikado Ryugamine longs for an escape from his dull everyday life and seeks something to make his young, short life stand out from the rest, resulting in him moving to Ikebukuro, a \"crazy\" to say the least city in Japan. He hopes life in one of Japan\u2019s most trendy commercial and entertainment cities can satiate his thirst for excitement and a little danger. But soon he discovers Ikebukuro is more than up to the task. An inhumanly powerful bartender, a skilled underground informant, a mysterious motorcyclist dubbed the Black Rider, an aggressively enterprising Russian sushi chef, along with all sorts of gangs are the least threatening people when there are more sinister plots simmering just beneath the surface of this urban jungle. \\n\\n\r\nThere really was no general plot to the story, each episode the perspective changes, meaning that the episodes are told in 1st person, by various characters. Certainly there were moments when I wondered, \"Where's the story headed?\", but in the end it was all answered. Each episode had a specific parallel supernatural mystery that initially appears oblique, but in the end all the mysteries are cleverly intertwined with one another, leading up to a satisfying ending. Durarara has quite a few cleverly surprising revelations and twists that had skillful misdirection, which constantly keeps the viewer guessing. Yet when expectations are heightened, the series likes to pull back, lower the tension, and make the climax seem unimportant. A thing I liked about the series is that it recognizes the important role that internet chat rooms, online associations, cell phones, and text messaging have in teenagers\u2019 social lives. Yet it also finds opportunities to tap into that adolescent pastime of discontent with the mundane everyday. I can't relate with the overall story, because it's so unrealistic, but I can definitely relate with the main character's feelings. With that said, there are also a few things I didn't like about Durarara: \\n\\n\r\n- Bad pacing; some episodes (20+ min) were dedicated to unimportant characters, and not on main characters. \\n\r\n- Plot is supposed to be dark, and mature, but it came out to be too bright, and naive.\\n\r\n- A couple moments when viewers are left to think, \"This doesn't even make sense...\" \\n\r\n- Way too much narration\\n\r\n- Main Character was annoying, and not very heroic, though the anime tried to portray him as so in the end(personal thought). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters is where Durarara shined best. The great appeal of Durarara is its diverse and colorful mix of personalities of numerous characters. During each episode, there's strang conversations on a chat in the computer, about the developing plot. I'll explain the mainest 5 characters in detail, but there are many more interesting characters that are thoroughly developed in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nMikado Ryugamine, the mainest of main characters is a polite, soft spoken boy, whom at times can be quite childish and naive. At first he is scared of all the chaos happening in Ikebukuro, but as the series progresses, Mikado gradually becomes more and more assertive, and eventually becomes able to able to accept the chaos that life throws at him without attempting to run away. With that said, despite his kindness and naivety, Mikado is much more ruthless and manipulative than he appears to be and is very capable at using intimidation to reach his goals. \\n\\n\r\nMasaomi Kida is Mikado's best [childhood] friend, and is a resident in Ikebukuro. He is one of the reasons Mikado moved to Ikebukuro, and while Mikado is in Ikebukuro, Masaomi acts like a big brother, protector. He is a rather cheerful boy (in public) and is always enthusiastic about picking-up girls, but seems to be a failure at it. As the series progresses, it is revealed that Masaomi's enthusiastic, happy-go-lucky demeanor is actually a mask of his true, much less secure self. He appears to agonize over major choices much more than any other character in the series, although he falls just short of being paralyzed by his fears. His background is explained in depth, and his true nature was a surprising twist in the plot. \\n\\n\r\nAnri Sonohara is a introverted and quiet girl, whom Mikado falls in love with. As the series progresses, she retains her shy personality, though her interactions with Mikado and Masaomi serve to pull her out of her emotional shell and she becomes much more expressive and shows a caring side to those close to her. The friendship she develops with Mikado and Masaomi was a treat to watch, something I could sort of relate with. Another character that the plot uses as a crazy, surprising plot twist. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character, Izaya Orihara. Izaya is a powerful, skilled, and snake-like informant, who is actually much more than just an informant. He claims to love the human race, excluding Shizuo Heiwajima whom Izaya likes to start fights. He greatly enjoys putting people in miserable or chaotic situations in order to observe their reactions. He plays chess in a bizarre fashion and the undiscloed rules he plays seem to be a metaphor for the way he lives his life. Izaya throughout the anime seemed like a \"god\" figure, because he always helped/protected people, but in a manner that makes him seem like an evil \"tester\". Anyways, very enjoyable character to watch for.\\n\\n\r\nShizuo Heiwajima is renowned as the strongest man in Ikebukuro. Shizuo apparently doesn't really like violence and has misgivings about his own strength; unfortunately, he has a very short temper and when angered, his body \"acts on its own\" and he beats everyone up. Shizuo is a very funny character who uses violence to cancel out violence... or when he's just pissed off... or if he sees Izaya. Shizuo Vs Izaya was a constant battle throughout the anime that was really fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nCelty Sturluson is a Dullahan, an unseelie fairy from Ireland who came to Japan looking for her stolen head (yes, she's headless). Celty's personality is, ironically, one of the most normal and down to earth out of the entire cast. Celty was certainly a character I personally did not enjoy. Celty, a badass who starts off with mysterious potential ends up becoming a useless, weak, and headless babe (always one in an anime...) who falls in love with a scientist. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's just the start of it, the list goes on and on, showing how much in detail Durarara focused on \"characters\". There should be at least one character that the audience can relate to. So, if you're wondering why I wrote useless information in my review, it was to represent how diverse and strong the \"characters\" were in Durarara.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the opening songs of Durarara were also unique and nice to listen to; I never skipped the openings while I watched the anime. The \"jazz\"iness in the anime certainly fit the mood of the anime throughout. The voicing was superb, each character's voice fitting their respective personalities. Izaya's voice, quiet yet manipulative and ominous, Shizuo's voice powerful, and deep, Mikado's voice, innocent and normal. The art was solid. The depiction of Ikebukuro is very accurate to the real city in real life actually. Each character had their own uniqueness. Overall very solid. The art style was certainly a bit different from the average anime though, in a sense that you have to watch the anime to understand.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: I like it, so I'd recommend others to watch it as well. Heh, thanks for reading!~",

            "content": "As I write, we're only about 7 episodes into \"Durarara!!\", but I'm already super pumped about this show. The creators have given me a lot of reasons to be satisfied so early into the series, and that's a mean feat considering how long it takes even some of the best anime to get up to speed.\r\nThe sheer amount of awesome in this show boggles the brain. The characters are the baddest of asses and every single one, bar none, is interesting and complex. One of my favorite character introductions is in the first episode: a vending machine rockets through the air and we're told, \"dudes,that's Shizuo, stay the hell away from him.\" And I probably would, but Shizuo is awesome. As is every other character in this remarkable cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe creators, who are also responsible for \"Baccano!\" (as by now you've heard), play with time in a similar way in this series. We may revisit the same moment from the perspectives of several different characters, but we're never lost, and it's certainly never like \"oh, this shit again, I didn't care the first time and I don't want to see it again.\" We know just enough to orient us, but we still haven't seen quite enough and are left yet with mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great, subtle when necessary, and the intro song is both an appropriately energetic introduction to the show and an awesome song in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, and sometimes most impressively, the art doesn't get in the way of the anime.

            "content": "I guess the most natural response would be to call this show a train wreck, but that would imply\n1.  There would have to be a train in one piece.\n2.  It would have to be on a set of railroad tracks.\n3.  It would have to be capable of moving in some direction.\nDurarara!! is more like starting off with all of the train cars scattered across the yard, then having an earthquake and expecting them to somehow find each other AND put themselves in the correct order.  (Nevermind getting on a track AND traveling somewhere.)\nTo put it in layman's terms:  DRRR isa mess.  There is no logical flow or coherence or reason in events that happen throughout the course of the series.  I wonder what \"Durarara\" actually means; if I were to venture a guess, I'd say \"crazy shit happening why because it's cool does it make sense no but that's okay because it's cool.\"  In the first two episodes alone, they introduce a number of characters not much less than two dozen.  How many of them actually end up being significant?  Well, not many.  How many of them is it possible to care for?  Not many.  Then why the hell are we wasting so much screentime?  No idea.\\n\\n\nThe pacing makes absolutely no sense.  In the first 7-8 episodes, nothing of any real importance happens at all: just a bunch of tiny events that one would think COULD be setting the stage for much more important things later on, but really aren't.  Basically, all they do is establish the fact that \"this is our city and crazy shit happens sometimes.\"  Well, ain't that wonderful.  It took you that long?  When things DO finally start happening, they come out of nowhere, get dropped and forgotten abruptly, picked up again just as abruptly, and end anticlimacticly in some aesop... er, cute little outro about how \"things went back to normal\" for them er... whatever.  Yeah, in a city where crazy shit is supposed to be a regularity?  Guess how long that lasts.  These little expositions simply serve as bookends that define where one arc ends and another begins.  They may as well just say, \"Okay this arc is over now; time for the next one,\" and it would have the same effect.\\n\\n\nThe writers obviously have no clue about what the concepts of buildup and foreshadowing are.  Granting for the sake of argument that there is in fact a complete train on the tracks and it is in fact in motion, the train is screeching and lurching and starting and stopping and running off the tracks then back ON the tracks and skipping stations randomly and...  Well, you get the idea.  Here's one example:  Out of nowhere, it is revealed that some dude started a group called the Dollars.  There is absolutely ZERO allusion that this may have been the case previously; ZERO hints dropped to get us thinking.  Nope.  They just throw the fact in your face when it becomes relevant and expect you to accept it.  Why did he do it?  BECAUSE HE WAS BORED.\\n\\n\nThat brings me to another problem:  Characterization occurs as the plot demands.  Suddenly, CRAZY SHIT HAPPENING OMG WTF WHY.  What's that?  It's all about some character who seemed completely insignificant until now?  Uh-oh.  Time for a flashback.  --5 minutes later--  \"And that's how he/she got to where they are today\" or \"this is the secret he/she has been hiding.\"  Er... wut?  'Scuse you?  Another example:  Suddenly, the guy with superhuman strength is saying that he's always hated his powers.  Wait, what?  He's been using them liberally on people, in front of people the entire show, and hasn't seemed to care in the slightest.  Okay...  There also seems to be a character who they were occasionally, half-assedly trying to paint as some type of MASTER OF PUPPETS AND I PULL YOUR STRINGS, but it's honestly impossible to tell whether he had any REAL significant role in the matters at hand or not.\\n\\n\nThe more I think about it, the more DRRR reminds me of Guilty Crown--in that GC ALSO likes to throw a shitstorm at you and then try to explain it as though it made sense afterwards.  (Oh gawd; drawing parallels to Guilty Crown; not a good sign.)  At least DRRR doesn't do it to quite an extreme degree.\\n\\n\nThe only exception to this trend is the case of one person whom they actually do a half-decent job dropping hints about the possibilities of his past and connections.  Why couldn't they do that for everyone else?\\n\\n\n*sigh*  Anyway, on to sound and art.  The OPs and EDs leave a bad taste in my mouth; there's no other way to describe it.  The OST is composed entirely of a bunch of slow, nonchalant, beep-boopidy xylophone tracks that sound pretty much the same--regardless of the events transpiring on screen.  No, actually, I think it's the SAME EXACT SONG over and over again.  (At least it sounds like it.)  The animation is generally pretty nice, although some big corners are cut at points--usually action sequences.  One time, a mob of generic, unimportant people (signified by the fact that they're completely gray) is attacking someone, and they all somehow morph together into one giant amorphous BLOB.  Seriously, guys: they're all gray.  At LEAST draw some lines in there so it looks like they haven't turned into some monster out of a '50s B-stock horror film.\\n\\n\nSo why the hell is DRRR's mean score so high?  Your guess is honestly as good as mine.  To its credit, it DOES have come pretty cool characters (Shizuo, Izaya, and Celty [rest are trash]), and there ARE some cool moments (almost always revolving around one of these 3 characters).  (Again, seriously: why do we spend so much time looking at dumb/pointless characters?  If they had just capitalized on the decent ones...)  Crispin Freeman and Johnny Yong Bosch put on a great show as always.  But that's it.  Some cool points.\\n\\n\nOH I ALMOST FORGOT.  They seem to REALLY enjoy throwing the word \"love\" around in the show A LOT.  No, I don't think you get it.  They do it.  A.  LOOOOOOTTTT.  There's this whole ordeal about a guy who \"falls in love\" with a head in a jar.  His obsession is nothing less than what can be classified clinically as a mental illness.  Love WHAT?  And that's not even the HALF of that story.  Seriously some of the most screwed up shit I've ever heard.  If I recall correctly, there's exactly ONE situation where the word is used that isn't mind-bendingly perverse or nauseatingly messed up.\\n\\n\nThe series really isn't very memorable in any way.  I've already forgotten most of what happened (except for the seemingly important stuff and cool doods).  Hell, I've already forgotten most of what happened in the episodes I watched just LAST NIGHT.  I think 17 episodes is more than enough to base an accurate review off of; if, after 17 episodes, it's still so physically painful to keep watching the show, then for the sake of my mental state, I refuse to keep going.",

            "content": "\"Just because I like humans doesn't mean I like you personally\" -Izaya\nDurarara is able to to keep you entertained for each entire episode. The art isn't so good as the colors are dull and the character's faces are often expressionless. On the other hand, both openings and endings were awesome.\nSimply put, Durarara!! is a show that attempts anything and everything. It seeks ensemble-based drama with enough humorous peripheral characters to lighten its load (and some romances thrown in for good measure), and in its spare moments delves into the supernatural and attempts a meta-fictional perspective on 21st century Japanese culture. The series throws development afterdevelopment at the audience, fascinating one with modernized takes on Irish folk tales, introducing a myriad of strange characters. Durarara!! is a frustrating show to watch, one whose core story is too light on weight to work and whose levity relies too much on the slapstick and obscure cultural references, and one whose most interesting aspects seem peripheral, with the stories of secondary characters and the framework of the show itself outdoing the rather bland leads in interest.\\n\\n\nThe musical score, meanwhile, was always a welcome listen, and the mix of free jazz, atmospheric vibraphone tracks, and piano pieces perfectly suited the show's quirky intent, with the pieces being well-placed if occasionally a bit repetitive. A show that frustrates is often one whose failings prove to still be interesting, and all things considered, most episodes of Durarara!! have at least one surprising quirk somewhere that makes them worth watching, even if the level of innovation is not sustained across the full episode. The series makes too many blunders for its story to leave much of a lasting impact, and its meandering moments becoming intolerably tedious at times, but the entirety, in spite of being unsatisfying, does have something of a distinct charm that keeps it slightly on the positive side of mediocrity.\\n\\n\nDurarara!!, meanwhile, introduces as many sub-plots as it does characters, with several remaining unresolved at series' end and various cliffhangers and tantalizing pauses leaving one curious for more and subsequently dismayed at the lack of closure. Characters sometimes act illogically, with the villainous sometimes too-easily re-integrating themselves into society and the main trio being given back stories that, while obviously designed to dramatically and stunningly bring the various \"clues\" the series drops early on into a cohesive whole, seem uncharacteristic and tacked on as a way to generate personality without really giving them any really depth. The end result is a story that feels much less of a triumph than it could have been, and even a surprisingly effective ending never covers up the show's lack of answers, reliance on flimsy plot-twists to maintain interest, and tepid moments brought about when the creators lie uncomfortably between bullet points in a plot summary, the flow having temporarily vanished and the audience being left with the bare bones of a fascinating but awkwardly presented thesis.\\n\\n\nMy overall score is 8.\\n\nPlease give me your feedback.\\n",

            "content": "What do you get when you take Baccano!, replace all interesting characters with angsty teens and characters defined by their repititious actions (one guy throws vending machines when angry, but hates violence - this is considered the equivalent of a \"personality\"), restrict it from killing anyone; even random extras, and have all feelings expressed through narration - given, otherwise you wouldn't have been able to tell?\r\nYou get Durarara!!. This show is awful. It's the child-friendly Baccano!, with complete disregard to the factor that Baccano! *was never meant for children*. If Baccano! had a disturbed and forbidden lovechild with Bleach, and that lovechild had a tumor,it would be Durarara!.\\n\\n\r\nStory (1/10):\\n\r\nI think this was a rough draft of a short story Narita wrote in high school. One day, Narita looked at it and said \"I should show this to someone.\" So, he approaches a random stranger on the streets and says \"Hey! Check this out!\"\\n\r\nStranger, bafflled by the current situation, agrees. After reading 3 pages, he gives his reaction:\\n\r\n\"Wow! This is really good!\" he declares, handing the pages back, \"B!TCH!\" - Oops, I forgot to mention it, but the stranger had tourettes. And couldn't really read narita's handwriting. \"FVCK SALT! THAT WAS AWESOME!\"\\n\r\nWith his newfound confidence, he turned it into his publisher. The published kinda-sorta skimmed the pages, but didn't really read it. As the editors trudged through it, they often found themselves bored and uninterested. By the 50th page, they decided to just give up and go get doughnuts.\\n\\n\r\nThis is how the anime came to be. It's not very good. In fact, it's not good at all. Everything that happens is merely a means for getting from Point A to Point B, then Point B to Point C. And Point C is actually Point A, so, in the end, no matter how many times it goes from one point to the next, it always ends up going nowhere.\\n\r\nIt follows the idea of jumping from perspective to perspective, similar to Baccano!, but it always tells us how something happens, or how a character is feeling, yet never shows us anything as back up. You can tell me a character has a special relationship with someone as many times as you like, but if all you ever show them doing together is walking around with a dreadfully bored expression, I'm not going to believe it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10):\\n\r\nPretty standard animation. Pretty boring. Only thing that stands out is the gray extras, and they're only gray 'cause they're boring.\\n\r\nCharacters are often stilted or seen doing the same thing with a different background.\\n\r\nCoolest bit of animation was epic mouse-moving, but that's also a pretty boring action.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/20):\\n\r\nVoice acting was okay.\\n\r\nBland pop music.\\n\r\nSounds usually sounded like they should. Kinda.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2/10):\\n\r\nAll the characers were about as deep as your standard Zetsubou Sensei character. Unfortunately, they were trying to be deep, yet Zetsubou Sensei's characters are intetionally 2-dimensional.\\n\r\nThey're all defined by one trait. With 24 episodes, none of the characters accomplish anything. What was the point of watching them? They only do their specific action repeatedly, and they only talk about their one, insignifacant - often nonsensical - motivation.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1/10):\\n\r\nThere were a couple points toward the beginning that were entertaining, but the majority was generic trash.\\n\r\n-Spoilers-\\n\r\nGang war plot? Leaders of gangs are best friends? Never seen that before. But wait! There's more! THERE'S A THIRD ONE?!?! That's still not creative! It certainly didn't need to be dragged out for 8 episodes, only to end with 3 charactes hugging eachother while crying \"I'm sorry!\" \"No, I'm Sorry!\" \"No, I was wrong! I'm sorryer!\" WAH~!!\\n\r\nThat's not even a climax, and I saw it coming 2 episodes into the story arce - except I didn't expect it to be that bad. It's not even worth watching.\\n\r\n-End spoilers-\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10):\\n\r\nDon't bother. Baccano! S2, please?",

            "content": "Before you click the \"not helpful\" tab, let me say something. I wrote this review at the start of the series, and made a bunch of predictions on how it will turn out, but I'm confident that I won't have to change any of the content in this review, even after the show ends. I'm as sure about the general structure and potential of this show as I possibly can be. (It's all here in this pamphlet *passes around*)\r\nI've now seen 10 episodes, and I could see how this was destined to go (not where, the two are different). It becomes very apparent that thisseries is formulated much like Baccano!. Which makes sense, since they share a common maker. Let me start by saying, if you want to find out about the story, read the synopsis, my job is to tell you what you can expect to come from the story.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough with the chit chat, what can I tell you about Durarara?\\n\\n\r\nNow, giving a review after 10 episodes is hardly a review, what am I reviewing? All I can, that's what!\\n\\n\r\nHere is what I can say about Durarara, it's all in the style, in the opening, and in the way the show is played out.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings in anime are often used as some sort of extra bit of animation, often just put together for purpose of killing a couple minutes before the show starts. Durarara is different. Every character is highlighted, and each (again, this is insight from having seen Baccano) will play an integral part to the plot. And if you watch the opening, you'll see there's a lot of characters introduced there, and it's somewhat difficult to follow. The purpose is not to introduce you to these chracters, but to have you reflect on what events are happening in the opening, after watching the show. Which is incredibly interesting and enveloping. You can take in everything about the show from the opening, but it's done in such a way there's no way to understand until it's been introduced. And this perhaps, is one of Durarara's greatest strengths.\\n\\n\r\nIt's all in the style. And it's style is like Baccano!'s only in the sense that, it involves a myriad of characters, each interesting and intriguing, whose stories are all interwoven into each others. Again, I am basing all my assumptions of this on my viewing of Baccano!, but I'd be willing to wager that each character's story will be introduced seperately, with the chronology of the events somewhat a mystery at first, rising to crescendo and then climaxing at the end in a fantastic accomplishment of plot and storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is fairly dark, which is seems to suck you in. An interesting point is that all the background people are simple shades of grey. The city is dark, full of night life, but carrying a sense of anticipation, excitement, amusement, and danger. Things feel very realistic, and at the same time, there's something going on behind the scenes that teases us with an element of our usual anime supernaturality. The same could be said about the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other thing I can say about the show at this point is the music. Durarara's soundtrack has already wowed me with it's elegant subtlety. The bass guitar plucking each note in scenes of tension. Each scene's mood is completely set by the background music, flowing beautifully, and establishing a mood.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can say Durarara is a tapestry being woven, where we are to inspect each section as an individual, and only at the end, evaluate it as a whole. And when this event occurs, we will see how each individual thread conforms to create an impressive and awe-inspiring image, which will be worth gazing at again and again, noticing subtle nuances with each new glance.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that, is Durarara. It is an cognitive, psychological excursion beyond our normal realm of understanding. I appreciate that I have told you very little as to who is in the show, but understand a show isn't about who, it's about what \"who\" does, and what is going on around \"who.\" And I've told you all I can about that. I'll once again say, this is all a prediction, one I feel very confident in, but a prediction nonetheless. I've based it off of work from the author previously. It might not turn out that way, but just like with a series of books, you can know whether or not you'll enjoy the next few by whether you'd enjoyed the first.",

            "content": "Watched the dub so that's what I'm reviewing.\r\nThe anime often shows you seemingly useless information, and at times following the flashbacks are very hard. The first few episodes were very slow, and not that engaging, and while it finished very well, the journey to that was less engaging.\r\nThe story and character interactions are very well strung together, perhaps too well at points, the flashbacks are sometimes a little hard to follow and the un centred nature of the anime made following the plot sometimes challenging. This anime isn't something that you can really attach 'antagonist' labels to something, while it's an understatement to say it'smostly the characters messing around with each other - it's probably a good summary.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation wasn't particularly high quality. The greying of non important characters was fine really, and helped you focus on what you were meant to, but most of the quieter scenes were animated very basically. Not so much as to detract from the story, but it lowered the engagement nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in the dub was very good, but the sound tracks were very heavily over used and to me they were getting clich\u00e9 by the end, such was the number of times I had heard them.\\n\\n\r\nI also personally didn't like the narrative style. Often what a character was thinking was literally said out loud, and the actual narrator was sometimes a character from the story and sometimes external. Without a very good ability to memorise an attribute the voices, following who was narrating what was hard, and the style of the fairly frequent narration lost any implicit messages. Everything was dictated to you like they didn't want you to miss it, and while all this information tied up brilliantly towards the end, it felt a little forced to me watching it at the start.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of pulling a surprise back story out of nowhere didn't really bother me, nor so much the characters/plot itself, more so the way in which it was presented.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation quality might be quite low, and the episodes at the start aren't that engaging, the anime does tie up nicely and deliver on the ending.",

            "content": "To describe \u201cDurarara!!\u201d as atypical or multi-faceted would be a severe understatement by any measure. Narita\u2019s creation is a rarity in that it is a show whose characters and the universe in which they inhabit are totally homogeneous \u2013 the characters are the universe and vice versa. Durarara is a piece of metafiction that primarily explores youth culture in Japan although much of its revelations and developments are relatable or can be extrapolated into the Western world. What is particularly impressive is that all this social commentary comes slickly packaged in a character drama whose comedy, romance, supernatural conceptions and eclectic cast can be appreciatedeven if one were to ignore the underlying purpose of them all. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you\u2019re willing to commit to Durarara, you will find there is an inexplicably larger amount of satisfaction to derive from than those who decide not to. I say this because Durarara is an incredibly complex story as it comprises of a large ensemble cast, all of whom play fundamental roles in the story which itself is told in a non-linear fashion. The storytelling is done in such a way that different parts of the story are experienced through the perspectives of a diverse set of characters which ranges from insatiable high-schoolers to eccentric Russian sushi chefs and a mythical motorcyclist. Throughout the show, viewers will be exposed to seemingly tangential subplots but as one would expect, they do all coalesce and are components of the story. Durarara's brilliance lies partly in this artistically inventive mode of storytelling which enables the show to carry a sophisticated narrative without feeling overbearing or convoluted because each episode or sequence is being narrated by new key characters that are still being introduced far down the story line which keeps each episode fresh and fascinating.\\n\\n\r\nWithin the space of 24 episodes, an enormous quantity of information is being relayed to the viewers and Durarara excels at juggling all its characters and subplots, giving the right amount of focus for all our characters. But it is precisely because the story is so hectic that it requires your full attention because all the supposedly \u201cirrelevant\u201d subplots and interactions are all elements that will be drawn upon much later on even into the second season. It is crucial to note that the notion of \u201cseasons\u201d is a purely economic one \u2013 the story doesn't suddenly \u201cconclude\u201d in the first season. Durarara is a singular piece of fiction based on light novels and whilst the show has arcs, the relevance of the show\u2019s arcs do not stop when the respective arc ends. Despite this, its ending does feel wholesome and it deftly executes the conclusion in such a manner that it could very well stand alone as an individual work.\\n\\n\r\nThe fundamental essence of Durarara is that of a supernatural Ikebukuro where the story is set. Indeed, Ikebukuro is the only one thing that connects all our characters and their plots. The series\u2019 presentation of modern society and youth can be seen by both its aesthetics, conceptions and the inclusion of the Internet. These exist to explore a whole host of ideas such as but not limited to: the notion of identity, especially in a world of anonymity, reality (or at least the perception of) and power and its various forms. But it does so by elegantly weaving this into the story rather than shoving these themes down your throat. Durarara vastly distinguishes itself from the rest by creating a consistently engaging fictional universe that emulates reality, where all these aspects exist and can be further delved into, instead of the usual attempts that feel artificial because it is evident that every creation of the story exists solely to explore a specific theme, sacrificing realism and preventing any semblance of transcendence from a work of fiction. I feel Durarara does transcend; it understands that there is no \u201cmain character\u201d in real life as we are all individuals living our own lives and in an increasingly connected world, there are bound to be overlaps. And if you have a cast like the one Narita has created, then you have one hell of a story.\\n\\n\r\nA show\u2019s universe is never complete without complementary audio-visuals. The soundtrack is a quirky, snappy and a primarily light-hearted score produced by a combination of piano and jazz instruments. It no doubt helps to construct Durarara's version of Ikebukuro and is unique although nothing too special, in my opinion. Conversely, I must mention that the OPs are outstanding and both OPS are of my personal favourites. Visually, the show is nothing too spectacular. The background and setting emulate much of real life Ikebukuro and the colour palette is wonderfully vibrant to match. The character designs are wholly distinct for each one and cement each character\u2019s idiosyncrasies and general traits - the abundance of Durarara artwork in the anime community acts as a testament to how beloved the character designs are.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Durarara is a multi-dimensional, fast-paced and innovative drama which successfully blends mystery, the supernatural, comedy, romance and social commentary. I feel that there is something for most people in this show with its diverse cast and multitude of subplots although much of the entertainment can be missed if you look for quick satisfaction. In which case, it may not be for you because the show definitely takes its time to explore itself and its many themes. If any of the aforementioned descriptions do appeal to you or you\u2019re simply looking for a distinct experience that encompasses a wide range of genres, then much like one of our characters, you may look to relocate yourself in this electrifying world that is Ikebukuro.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ikebukuro is one crazy ass town set in one crazy ass country that produced one crazy ass series of novels that now has a crazy ass anime adaptation, now replace \"crazy ass\" with \"entertaining\".\r\nSTORY: Durarara (Or DRRR, which by the way sounds like an insult to someone when they make a stupid or obvious statement) can be described as two things: crazy and entertaining, and entertaining and crazy. Durarara is as crazy as it is entertaining, I mean what other anime has gang wars, superhuman people, super natural elements, and enough characters pushed up into like several clown cars, packed up like sardines, that startto break the hinges and screws start flying off... I can name one other but anyway, Durarara is the adaptation of light novels created by Ryohgo Narita, the creator of another crazy ass series named Baccano (Which there is only one other series I can compare that one too).\\n\\n\r\nBut seriously, I must applaud this novel writer, who now has two well loved series under his belt that both received great anime adaptations, that's right I'll say it right now, Durarara is a great anime, great as in entertaining, with an early competent story and a huge cast of wonderful and unique characters.\\n\r\nThe story is about... mostly everyone! Just about all the characters receive a good bit of devoted screen time and get to narrate an episode, and you should be intimidated by what I mean by \"everyone\" as Durarara just has too many to write about in one review, so I'll just write about the most interesting ones, and the \"main\" characters, as the third half focuses entirely on those certain set of \"main\" characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't really straight forward but mostly character driven, the entire anime can be summed up into three parts: The first 1/3 is the slow start, building up the characters and establishing many elements of the series, the second 1/3 is pay off of the start up, fantastic and fun moments are all found here folks with a lot of the more interesting characters featured the most, and then finally the last 1/3, the umm, lamest part of the anime...\\n\\n\r\nThe first third of the anime is spend mostly introducing characters and establishing bits of story elements for the latter part of the anime with Mikado, the seemingly main character of Durarara and his friends Kida, his childhood friend, and Anri, a well endowed girl with a quite interesting back story. It's pretty slow to say the least, but it's all worth it later on.\\n\r\nThe second third of the anime is the real meat of the entire anime, with the build up from earlier episodes, but the real reason is because the majority of the focus is on the more interesting characters like Celty, the headless Dullahan from Ireland who drives a black motorcycle around the city, Shizuo Heiwajima, the one guy in the dangerous city full of many dangerous people that you don't want to mess with, and other characters related to them in some fashion.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the last third of the anime is where I wouldn't mind to say there's no point on continuing further, unless you're a completest or have been enjoying the show to this point and want to continue. The story quickly shifts from being creative unique character driven story to a very lame teen drama involving gangs, with the focus being the most bland group of characters of the entire anime (Like Mikado and Kida), with the villain having the charisma of a random background character (And looks and starts out like one too). \\n\r\nI would consider calling this part of Durarara, DRRR, as it's sort of an insult to be stripped of all the greatest parts by the end of the anime, sure the other characters do have their moments (Like Shizuo tearing shit up), and bad moments too (Shizuo learns that he too be taken out by simple measures just like everyone else, and of course, the teen drama), but there is still worth while parts (A certain a**hole gets whats coming to him, and damn is it satisfying).\\n\\n\r\nThough it's a shame Durarara mostly ends on a low note rather than a high one, but it blows it's load early on, and it might be a good idea to pretend it's only like 13 or 16 episodes like it's predecessor adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Very unique and stylish, with character designs by Suzuhito Yasuda (The original artist for the novels and creator of manga series Yozakura Quartet). Apparently the original creator of Durarara wants consistency that even the studio that made Baccano, Brains Base, is also the one behind the production.\\n\r\nThe animation is great, and the character designs are diverse enough to compliment their personalities and quirks (Of course a headless girl wouldn't need a detailed personality to stand out from the crowd), but most of them look rather generic, and the later part of the anime looks noticeably lower budget.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: With both a japanese and english voice over for Durarara available, I would recommend going your preference language to listen to since both languages are fine, however, I would give a more slight nod to the japanese voice over simply because the setting is Japan, and the english dub voice actors tend to be stumped by a japanese word when it would appear in dialogue, overall both have their stellar performances that only each language provides.\\n\r\nThe theme music are great, especially the first opening, but as the later part of anime becomes blander, so does the theme music.\\n\r\nThe background music is mostly loud jazz music, that seems out of place at times.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ A unique and great character driven story.\\n\r\n+ Diverse cast of interesting characters.\\n\r\n+ Both japanese and english voice overs are equally great.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- The last third of the anime is disappointing, with too much focus on the bland characters.\\n\r\n- The technical side also suffers at the later end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs an added bonus, Durarara also has many cameos of several different anime thrown about, so be sure to pay attention to the back grounds and what figures and manga you'll see.",

            "content": "For anybody trying to decide on whether or not they should watch Durarara, do yourself a favor and watch it. This anime is easily one of the best I've ever seen. The story starts off a little slow with a shy and timid boy named Mikado moving to new city in Japan who has high hope to start a new life. from there the story takes off. The anime stays pretty consistent with presenting new information and ideas, and easily keeps your attention. As far as story goes it is one of the most well thought out, complex, developed, and mature plots I've ever hadthe pleasure of watching. When I say mature I don't mean that there are breasts bouncing around everywhere or anything else ecchi like that, but mature as in you have to have some type of common sense to keep up with whats going on, which is another thing I love about this anime.It is not the type of story where everything is laid out on silver platter for you. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWithin the very first seconds of this anime you know that the illustrators took pride in what they were doing. Every scene is intricately drawn to keep the audience entertained, whether you may be looking at a vibrant and colorful vending machine flying across the sky, or a dark and mysterious alleyway waiting for you to make the mistake of deciding to take the shortcut home.9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are experienced when it comes to watching and anime you know that the soundtracks in the anime can make or break it. Fortunately for Durarara they knew exactly what they were doing. For an anime to have such a wide variety of genres they spread it out extremely well to compliment every scene needing an extra push of anxiety, calmness, happiness, or anger. Durarara isn't the type of anime to leave you crying at the sound of some beautiful soundtrack but you will definitely catch yourself at the edge of your seat while yelling something to a  character attempting to do something that could potentially lead to their demise. This anime features genres everywhere from Rock all the way to Classical or Pop so you don't need to worry about getting bored with the soundtracks although you will be able to associate some of the soundtracks with a certain type of scene. -Every time I started an episodes I would always listened to the opening at least twice just because I liked it so much :)-. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom the beginning of this anime you are constantly given new information about every character, whether it may be told to you straight forward or something you discover on your own by untwisting the plot. What I am trying to say is that you immediately start to form some type of relationship and, or bond with every character in the show. There is constantly new character development so you don't have to worry about getting bored with one character. Another thing I like about this anime is that you are given the opportunity to see things in another characters eyes besides the protagonist. This is a very great technique to give the audience a chance to get to know a character because you are seeing exactly how they think instead of just seeing the main character perception on that person. Every character in the anime played an important and irreplaceable role. They all add their own little spin to the plot which keeps you interested in how the story may change once you learn something new about a character. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs far as enjoyment goes just try to stop watching this anime in the middle of a big part of one of the charter's arch. I can tell you that I stayed up until 3am even though I knew I had to get up at 6:40am simply because I did not have it in me to call it quits. Every episodes leaves you wanting more so if you are worried about not being able to get through this anime you should be more worried about stopping once you've started. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is nothing short of a master piece. There is only one thing that I really wanted to happen that didn't. If you are looking for a serious anime but you want to laugh I wholeheartedly encourage you to give this one a try. 10/10 Thanks for reading guys ^__^ (by the way this is my first review)\\n\\n\r\nTk\\n\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER BELOW\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen I said there was only one thing that didn't happen that I wanted to happen it was Mikado and Anri not getting together. His excuse was that he wanted to wait for Kida to come back to try and make a move even though Kida got back with his old girlfriend and left. -__-\\n",

            "content": "Trying to figure out how to write a review about this in a way that made sense, the best I could come up with is that this feels like an attempt to imitate Baccano while conforming it to much more normal anime standards and tropes. \r\nThe reason that Baccano is phenomenal is that it ignores many of these standards and focuses on its chaos and glib fun. Durarara, on the other hand, chose a plodding pace and complete lack of chaos, which would be perfectly fine on its own, but it tries to imitate Baccano's charm and sense of wildness, so a lot of Durararaends up feeling forced and entirely inauthentic.\\n\\n\r\nI found that the real root of my utter dislike for this series is rooted in the characters. Perhaps some of it comes from my dislike of slice of life stylings. For instance, the simpering \"romance\" maybe or maybe not developing between Mikado and Anri made me grimace every time it was a focal point, and the \"glib\" romance of Selty and Shinra is just as plodding and unbearable for me, mostly because Selty is such a pansy about it at all times. But it is not just that...I find Shinra inauthentic, I find Anri and Selty inauthentic, and Shizuo and all his IZAYAAAAAAAAing and swinging around street signs a shoddily inauthentic attempt at badassery. They are all just so tepidly crafted and their existences in the series so plodding that I cannot help but not want to see them at all.I would be more fine with this if the focal point were Masaomi and his buddies/Mikado and a steady explanation of the Dollars, with a plodding pace to match the scenic action, but instead they are shifting around constantly between scenes and characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe other root of my dislike is probably the scenic action. Again, I feel like plodding scenes randomly barged in on by the IZAYAAAAAing and the like is really disruptive and both waters down the plot. While the scenes are certainly coherent, they drag all the time, like any of the scenes between Selty and the doctor. Perhaps some incredible part of the story or some incredible action will happen later on, but as of episode 11 ending with an awful Selty action scene (horrible whining by her, horrible action), a lot more scenes in this anime have bothered me than have thrilled me!\\n\\n\r\nEven without the character problems, I do not really feel the whole vibe of \"a city made of jokes, whims, and coincidences.\" Everything moves at such a plodding pace with predictable, tepid action that everything is very explicitly planned. You never feel surprised by anything at any time. I get the feeling that this might be a loss from the novel to the anime, but that is just a guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound varies between interesting and awful, but only Selty's voice acting particularly bothered me as far as that goes. The art varies between average modern anime and average modern anime, so nothing really exciting nor bad there. The story is entertaining enough when not getting in the way of itself, like with the overuse of computer gossiping to actually propel the plot, rather than just show how excited everyone is about the events of the super awesome city.\\n\\n\r\nI do not expect you many people to agree with me about my take, and that is fine. I had a long discussion with mostly one person, and there was enough for me to turn into this review, so I decided to go ahead and make it. I do apologize for making this a bit too much about Durarara versus Baccano, but I felt that it had to be part of the discussion.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that certain part of episode 11 that everyone is \"excited\" about is just disgusting fanservice (the clothing standing out was a really nice touch, but that was about all that I liked there). Again, surprisingly inauthentic following up a series so authentic like Baccano.",

            "content": "Okay, so after surrounding all the hype that encased this show, and because Crispin Freeman made a big deal about it at NYAF 2010, I decided to give it a shot. Half of me feels like it was a waste of time, and the rest of me isn't so sure. I am almost finished with it at this point, but I feel that writing the review now might be best (the end that is in sight isn't looking good.)\r\nNow, if you're one of the people looking to watch this show because you enjoyed Baccano! (I mean, who didn't?), then this is NOT for you. Itwill rub you all sorts of the wrong way. If you are someone that enjoys psychological thrillers with violence and mythology, step right up! However, I warn you now that it is a LOT to keep track of and isn't an overdose of any one genre specifically (except the sick pervy romance kind.) \\n\\n\r\nLet's begin with the STORY, which I gave a 6. I pondered over this one for a little because it's actually a lot of stories all jammed in together, and individually they are all pretty boring, but together it makes for an interesting mix. In Baccano, which I highly recommend, you have three or less stories to keep track of at any one time; in Durarara, you have ... I dunno... a lot? A lot. You've got headless horsemen, sick doctors, unloved high school girls, a psychotic informant, some guy that throws vending machines, high school kids that lead huge street gangs, and some manga-obsessed quad-team that doesn't seem to matter but takes up screen time to confuse you. And yes, all of these things are stories that all interlace and run headlong into each other, until you don't know which was is up or down, and if you wanted it to be either of them! \\n\\n\r\nGranted, people throwing vending machines is REALLY cool, so Crispin Freeman can have his kudos for being one of the few awesome characters. But I mean. If you're just gonna watch it for Shizzy-chan, then just watch episode 7, which is his backstory, and be done with it. \\n\\n\r\nI just have a sinking feeling that this is the kind of anime that won't ever be resolved in a satisfying way. Why do I say that? Well, at the point where you find the epicenter of ONE of the plot lines, and two characters meet head to head (figuratively speaking, since one of them is headless), there is the feeling that the source of all the pain should be taken and everything can be resolved and we can move forward. What happens? One of the characters says 'Nice job killing everyone. Bye.' \\n\\n\r\nSeriously?\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the art (which got an 8 in my book). Well. It's very stylized, and I particularly love the grayed out background people, because it helps you keep track of who is not important. Until of course, everyone gets colored in as a huge 'EVERYONE IS IMPORTANT' statement. Hello Captain Obvious! I won't deny that the animation is fairly well done and the background work is phenomenal. Very rarely do they reuse any of the footage. We see the inside of one man's office maybe 20+ times, and only 3-5 of those times is it the same art. I really appreciate them not half-assing it artways, but it doesn't necessarily make up for the shitty incoherent plot they tried to concoct. \\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, I'm extremely picky. If I don't notice it, it sucked. My favorite sound track is from Eureka Seven, but I can honestly say DRRR comes pretty close! It is not very often that I actually LIKE the OP and ED songs from a show these days. It is even rarer that animators use music correctly! However, they have a refrain that they play several times when everyone should be rainbows and butterflies, and I love it! Absolutely love it! So the sound got a 9! \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were... mediocre at best. They were all very stereotypical, and nothing was TOO surprising. Watching them develop hasn't been the most interesting thing in the world, in fact it sometimes seems irrelevant despite the fact that the whole thing slowly seems to be turning into a slasher soap opera. As I said for the 'story' section, it is more about the characters than anything else, and so their histories ARE, essentially, the story. But you know, innocent high schoolers being majorly important gang leader/murderer/opposing gang leader... that's really original. I totally didn't see that coming in Higurashi when all the girls took out butcher knives and killed everyone. Come. On! \\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy all the character DESIGNS. Especially Shizuo and his bartender outfit, and Selty with her shadow-leather biker suit. So I didn't score it TOO badly. I just wish... all the characters had been less typical. In Baccano, all the characters kept me guessing; I couldn't tell bad from good and I loved every second of it! (Jacuzzi was the most surprising!) But man... like I didn't know Celty was gonna turn into a pile of mush around her captor (Stockholm Syndrome much?) Shinra? Everyone can see it coming, so it's not a spoiler. If you didn't, this anime is too dense for you, you need some light hearted shojo. (May I recommend Kaicho wa Maid-sama?) \\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, I gave it a 6. I'm still watching it aren't I? Could be I'm cooped up in the house for winter break like any anime fan, but it also could be that it has a mildly captivating watch value. I would recommend a rewatch, but only because it's so damn confusing. I feel like I should make a chart or something; in fact... I almost did. But how silly is that? If you have to watch anime with a chart, then it's too fucking complicated. Even Spice and Wolf, which people complain has a LOT of dialogue, isn't that complicated (AND IT INVOLVEES MATH PEOPLE.)\\n\\n\r\nSo anyway, I gave DRRR a 6. And I wanted to be able to provide a comprehensive reason as to why I'm scoring so low, so as to provide a new and fresh look on things. I hope it helped!",

            "content": "The anime has a series of tags and I would add 'psychological' to better describe some scenes. The story immediately caughts your attention by the way it's told, not by the content itself. Narita, the original creator and the rest of the team, in this regard used some cool classic tricks seen on many \"best seller\" books. Not only that, but overall the 'sound guys' managed to capture every scene with the right OST, making this an anime very easy to marathon.\r\nMonologues? Check. \r\nIts quality can vary, sometimes it feels brilliant, by giving insight to what the characters are thinking or to give a betterunderstanding of them. The problem lies in the action, sometimes it's just missing by plot constraints, which gives the (now and then) long monologues an important task. They must keep the viewer hooked. Doesn't always work, as not every single line of dialogue is great. So be aware,  you can have the feeling it's just there to fill blank spaces (maybe to reach those 24 eps mark).\\n\\n\r\nReverse chronology? Check.\\n\\n\r\nAn old trick but reliable. Many times the episodes starts showing the third act (final scene; climax), then going back to the first act (the setup act). This arouses the viewers attention, as you now are hooked to watch until you can comprehend that final scene. \\n\r\nSome times, to exploit and empathize some important moment in the overall comprehension of the story, the first act (setup) is also traded with the second (development) and vice-versa.\\n\\n\r\nI'll describe the feeling as seeing a Houdini's trick. Admiration and confusion will be felt at the beginning, then you'll slowly understand what you're watching as the trick is revealed.\\n\\n\r\nNarrative? Check.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a considerable number of characters. Not all have the same importance to the story, but there's at least one ep, where we will be presented with a certain point of view, where their opinion will be given on whatever is going on. It's not perfect as sometimes you can feel a little bittersweat about some of them, especially in the second half of the plot. It's there where you'll notice some flaws in some characters design.\\n\\n\r\nOST? Check.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is what I would call the perfect 'accompanist'. It's just a series of spot on instrumental beats that follows the visual and the plot, and that's it. Don't expect epic tracks to be played, a beautiful voice singing as an epic kick throws someone of. The show already has a lot going on, intricate ways of story telling, different characters (points of view) are shown all the time, lots of suspense, etc. Having those kinds of songs would just get in the way and divert your attention from the suspense. In this regard, I'll consider this anime OST not perfect or a masterpiece but the best 'accompanist' I've seen, as it just sets the right mood. \\n\\n\r\nI'll not mention openings and edings, as that to me is only relevant if used in the actual scenes, not just at start and end. \\n\\n\r\nSome quick regards for the animation. It's well made and executed well; not overwhelming, but it also doesn't go unnoticed. Kuddos for some details, like making the spectators who not intervene in the course of action/ or are not important to the plot go grey! Barely any visible mistakes in the animation.\\n\\n\r\nIs it perfect? No. I already hinted that it's not a masterpiece, especially at the beginning: \"caughts your attention by the way it's told, not by the content itself\". I'll not compare this show to Bacanno like most do, because I want to focus in one important story aspect, so forgive the next comparison. Anime like Shinsekai Yori or Shingeki no Kyojin have one thing in common, whether you agree it's well executed or not... Both start of with a very compelling plot or story that immediately hooks you. This show doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's Durarara then? It's your normal setting/plot that can get interesting because of the way it's told. Despite all the gimmicks I said previously, it doesn't change that fact! The team who worked on Durarara never had a compelling story, so they had to use every trick they could to make it stand out. I have no doubt, if it wasn't for them, Durarara would not be as good as it was, it would fall to average or fine. \\n\\n\r\nVideo: BD 720p\\n\r\nAudio: FLAC\\n\r\nMethod : marathon 24eps\\n\r\nOverall evaluation: 7.8",

            "content": "This anime is... for lack of a better term, the most freaking amazing thing I've ever seen. At first I was a bit worried, since I usually hate anime with the whole gang war theme and all, not to mention the first episode was a little bit slow, as well as the whole 'headless rider' seemed a bit silly. The characters (namely Izaya, Shizuo, Celty, Shinra... hell, all of the,) were what got me. Even the protagonist, who may seem like an average, boring male protagonist had some of his own secrets. But I'll explain in detail.\r\nStory: Like I said, I had my doubts, butwhen it started actually revealing itself, the blend of the modern and fantastical and sci fi ended up blending perfectly. With the whole Dullahan concept, the mythology, in addition to the Slasher, plus the modern-ness of it being set in a big city, as well as the Namie plotline in the beginning... It may seem like those would clash a lot, but they really don't. There's a fair bit of action in it, but nothing overwhelming to make it be called an action anime for me. LOTS AND LOTS of plot twists, but it keeps you surprised even to the end, and keeps you interested in what's going to happen next. Not predictable.. at all. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Not much to say, I really liked the animation of it. It's quite refreshing and smooth compared to the Naruto and the Bleach type of animation; it's different and the city was animated beautifully. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: I adored the music in this anime, although I felt that the soundtrack could be a bit more diverse. You'll hear the same themes and songs a lot, but so far (And I've rewatched this about 6 times) I still enjoy listening to the music. The openings and endings are epic as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The most intriguing and amazing part of this anime, by far. It starts out with Mikado, who, though he may seem like the generic awkward male protagonist, has his own secrets that will shock you. His friend, Kida, is one of my favourites... he's adorable, first of all, although he also has lots of his own secrets and he'll surprise you... a lot. Anri gets kind of annoying since a lot of the plot is centered around her, but I actually did come to respect her once her character was really revealed. Izaya is my favourite, though. He pulls the strings with everyone... even in the beginning, he's introduced as a psycopath with no concern for other humans, although he loves them. His constant messing with peoples heads and being an awful person to everyone.. was just hilarious a lot of the time, especially since he does random adorable things like when he was walking next to Celty on her motorcycle and was all \"Vroom Vroom! Vrrrrrroom!\" But he also brings up psycological issues and concepts during the show, which actually make you think-- which is just amazing in an anime, and very rare usually. Shizuo I adored as well. He's mostly a comic relief character, since he's always being violent and hitting people with street signs even though he claims to hate violence.. yeahhh. Celty.. the other main female protagonist. I actually love her. Usually I hate female protagonists as a rule, but her character is complex without being overly tragic, and she's a genuinely good person without being all annoying and motivating. Shinra is just adorable with her, although he's does have his own faults and he isn't perfect. He's still adorable. That's it for major characters, but overall... they're just  epic. Even though they may seem like stereotypes at first glance, none of them are what they seem. Even the minor characters provide just enough comic relief (and anime references) to keep the show happy, but still have a serious undertone. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were all just amazing as well, they brought it to life beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: ...I've watched it 6 times within like, 3 weeks. I never got tired of the characters. Although it is a bit repetitive, the way it goes episode to episode explaining in detail what's going on from another perspective, that's one of my favourite parts about it; the way the story progresses from more than one perspective. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: This is by far the best anime I've ever seen, I'd recommend it to anyone, no matter what their tastes are, since it has a bit of everything and an excellent cast of characters.",

            "content": "I finally finished \"Durarara!!\" and while there were characters that I liked and moments that were entertaining, I don't think it's a series I would willingly put myself through again. I'm not even sure I liked it as a whole.\r\nPutting aside the immediately obvious fact that the animation for this series is superb and all opening and ending songs are awesome, what's left for me to complain about is the pacing, the plot, and the nearly nonexistent character development. Oh, and the mind-numbingly boring way in which the dialogue is remarkably unsubtle, anvilicious, and pretentious.\r\nI know this is based on a series of light novelsand that there's also a manga version. But while I know a bit about both, I haven't read enough of either, and this is an anime review anyway, so I'm glad I haven't yet so I can focus on the anime. I actually wonder if I may be too old for this anime, because it left me completely unimpressed, didn't change my point of view in anyway, and I learned nothing and felt nothing while I watched it. It felt like the entire thing was made by a bunch of disaffected college students that have nothing better to do with their spare time than angst about how the world is so sad and boring. And while this seems perhaps an unfair attack on the team that made the anime and for all I know they're completely the opposite, it's how the series came off as.\\n\\n\r\nFor all the darkness or apparent maturity of the themes, the show comes off as incredibly naive. The characters spend way too long and talk too much in an effort to explain themselves and their actions. There's too much talking! Even when what they're saying is plainly obvious or when they could have stopped after one sentence and it's especially annoying when you realize that their justifications are pretty much senseless or stupid after the nth time they've explained it. I honestly blocked out whole chunks of dialogue from boredom. Then I went back to see if I missed anything by doing so. I didn't.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think the series is as meaningful as it thinks it is, and I wasn't moved by most of the characters. The only ones I really cared about by the end of it all was Kida Masaomi and Celty, the headless biker. (And Heiwajima Shizuo who is crazy awesome. I like Orihara Izaya and he's one of my favorite characters, but I don't really care or am concerned about the guy because he should honestly die in a fire.) Speaking of which, what really bothered me was how so many of the characters escaped karma -- except Kida Masaomi, who the show seemed determined to break because that's his designated role. The show also tries to present Mikado Ryuugamine as somewhat of a hero, which I refuse to accept. And to bring up the manga and novels, I think the anime tries much harder than those two make him likeable or acceptable (and overall NICER) to count as one and it's obvious. I'm sorry, but no. Better to have left him a bit of a magnificent bastard than to do so. By extension, the Dollars are supposed to be the good gang, which is laughable, since while they do some good in the anime, they're not much different from the bad gangs -- they're a bunch of easily manipulated cowardly sheep who can't even do good on their own (with the exception of a few, but they're in the extended hero's group so...).\\n\\n\r\nWhat really bothers me about the Dollars is, had their leader been actually smarter and less interested in his own entertainment, they could have PUT AWAY SOMEONE THAT'S DONE SOMETHING CLEARLY WRONG. In the first half, the major conflict involved a shady pharmaceutical company responsible for a string of kidnappings and that was covering up an assault. Granted, the assaulted girl was cray cray and a stalker, and she didn't press charges because she's madly in love with the guy that nearly killed her and they wound up together thanks to the said pharmaceutical company, but really? REALLY? The guy that ALMOST CRACKED HER HEAD OPEN escaped punishment and is later on referred to as \"he's weird, but kind of cool\"? By the show's protagonist? WHAT?! And what did the leader of the Dollars choose to do about this? MESS WITH THE MIND OF THE PERSON BEHIND ALL OF IT. Yeah, that's all. And the result? Was not so awful that by the next episode she's seen working for the information broker that orchestrated it all while still full of haughty arrogance. And speaking of the information broker, I don't know if he really is just that awesome or the other characters are just so stupid or weak that he's pretty much untouchable despite being so plainly evil.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that could have possibly redeemed this whole show was the friendship between the three main characters (Anri, Mikado, and Kida). But as a friendship, it just fails. There are countless other anime and manga that have portrayed friendship in an amazingly poignant way. This anime had that chance but it just fell so miserably short.\\n\\n\r\nThe light novels and the manga version of this show goes farther from what I've seen and heard about. If there's a second season, my point of view might change.  Who knows? As it stands, it's pointless, other than being pretty to look at. Much of the show seems focused on being cool for the sake of being cool and that's it.",

            "content": "Durarara; a review.\r\nI would like to note the massive popularity this show commands, and the rabid nature of its fanbase. Normally, this would be a good enough reason for one to abstain from critically reviewing this show, but oh, the thrill of jabbing at the hornets' nest...\r\nLet us commence.\r\nRound One: The Stage.\r\nAlright, this one is going to be a mess, and I should get this over with in the first bit of the review. Durarara does not have a plot. It has barely any backstory, and relies more on the established 'Rule of Cool' rather than an interesting story or an intricate plot, or evenjust the premise of complete pandemonium that made its predecessor 'Baccano!' such a phenomenal success. However, that is not to say that Durarara has nothing to offer in this field. \\n\\n\r\nJust like its predecessor 'Baccano!', Durarara does not rely on a dominant and omnipresent central plot, but rather on the characters, although it does try to give a certain amount of depth to the stage, and this is where it fails. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, you can put up a decent enough play without equipping your stage with crimson curtains and whatnot, and instead focusing on your cast. Should you succeed in the latter, it might still be an extremely enjoyable presentation. If you to divert your attention to the stage itself for a slight, change your mind, and leave it there will certainly result in a spectacular failure on both sides. \\n\\n\r\n'Durarara!' is set in Ikebukuro, one of the more dangerous urban neighborhoods in Japan. The neighbourhood plays host to all of Durarara's resident checkpoints on the unwritten list of anime stereotypes. The story takes place in the aftermath of a gang war that is only known as 'The color gang war', something we find out close to nothing (interesting) about. This was a miserable failure at adding depth to a stage, and is where it falls short. \\n\\n\r\nFor a rating, I'm going to have to give this section a 4 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRound Two: The Cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe collection of Ikebukuro's occupants who partake in the story of Durarara! isn't exceptional in any sense.\\n\\n\r\nYou have Mikado Ryugamine; a country bumpkin who's moved into this wild urban district to-\\n\r\nYes, go to high school\u2026\\n\\n\r\nCross out 'Well-endowed class representative' (with a deep, dark secret that you will not give two Kusos for) and 'Pervert best friend' on the aforementioned list of anime stereoty- Oh, I know! Let's do something that has NOT been done to death in the world of Anime; put 'em in a love triangle! \\n\\n\r\nThen, you have your filler material. Enter; \\n\r\n - The Otakus. \\n\\n\r\n - The walking sack of anger issues that tosses weighty objects at anybody who looks sideways at him (CRISPIN FREEMAN!)\\n\\n\r\n - His sworn foe, the 'Smart guy' with an affinity for slick combat (knives and evasion)\\n\\n\r\n - The immigrant (they emphasize upon that to a degree that borders on racism) African-Russian sushi-bar worker.\\n\\n\r\n All of the characters above get absolutely no development. Their introductions are rather bland, and their hastily added origin stories are almost cringeworthy. The most they receive are shallow labels which do little more than make sure you don't mix them up.\\n\\n\r\nBut enter a pleasant surprise; there is an ace in this chaotic mess of a deck, and that would be Celty Sturlurson.\\n\\n\r\nCelty is a Dulahan, the celtic equivalent of the grim reaper, a being with a dismembered head that guides souls into the afterlife. However, Celty differs from other Dulahan as she is missing her head, and is in the process of searching for it. She is the only standout character amongst this ocean of cardboard cutouts, alongside Shinra, whom she shares an\u2026 Unusual relationship with. Watching this is, quite frankly, is thrice as interesting as the rest of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf I could change this show (and good lord, do I wish it to be so), I would focus on what the show is really about; Celty. The other characters only serve to detract from her story, and the focus is on the worst possible group. \\n\\n\r\nThis aspect of the show, in my opinion, gets a rating of 6 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRound Three: The Sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is where this show really picks itself up, with some funk and jazz, and a very Baccano-esque initial opening theme (both in terms of animation and sound) that I thoroughly enjoyed. There's even a couple of unconventional but compelling tracks with solo upright bass that I particularly appreciated. In this respect, the show follows in the footsteps of Baccano, and the results are remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nWith two solid dubs and a great score, I see no reason why it doesn't merit a 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRound Four: The Animation.\\n\\n\r\nI'll have to concede that the animation for the show isn't all that bad, and it even has an appreciable organic vibe to it. However, at times this doesn't shine where it needs to, and I can even recall scenes where the average animation quality detracted from the show itself. As is evident, there is no worse sin that the art of a show can possibly commit. For shows that follow the previously mentioned 'Rule of Cool', the animation requires a certain emphasis which this show doesn't seem to have.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation scores a 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRound Five: Entertainment Value.\\n\\n\r\nI might appear to be dissatisfied during the course of my this review, but when I watched the series, I found that I was rather enjoying it, and would watched a slew of episodes in a single setting. It would be abject dishonesty to say that it wasn't enjoyable initially, but following the first few episodes, I found it was becoming boring rather quickly, and all of the aforementioned flaws became painfully apparent. Some were prominent enough to serve as immediate deterrents, but its merits were just enough to counteract them when they received attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe score for entertainment value is a 6 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall score for this series will be determined by the average of the above scores, which is a 6.4 out of 10, rounded off to 6 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nAs for an alternative, I would recommend Baccano, which is the spiritual predecessor to this series, and does everything a whole lot better, and I can say this despite not having completed the series yet (which is a very good sign). Also, most of Baccano is set about a century before Durarara, with certain parts in the 18th and early 21st centuries, so if that strikes your fancy, it's definitely a show you will like.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The world of anime never ceases to come up with new and fascinating series, original and interesting storylines, or iconic and highly memorable characters. There\u2019s a reason why this form of entertainment (and art) has attained such widespread reach over the years, and I truly believe that its decisive power lies in the near unrestrained creativity present in each and every anime series, original video animation, and whatnot. This freedom of expression and imagination has become somewhat of a signature for the Japanese animation industry, acting as sort of an assurance that anime features plenty of exclusive elements and things you won\u2019t get to seeanywhere else. Sometimes that can be a bad thing (if you know what I\u2019m saying), but let\u2019s face it, most of the time that\u2019s undeniably beneficial to both the creators and the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nA recent anime series, entitled Durarara!!, is a perfect demonstration of what the Japanese animation industry is capable of and the benefits of its broader range of creativity. Stretching over twenty-four episodes (not taking into account any possible OVAs or specials), Durarara!! tells a wonderfully unique story set in the Ikebukuro district of Tokyo, Japan. Dealing with themes such as friendship, betrayal, gang wars, the urban lifestyle, identity and the lack thereof, consumerism, and even the supernatural, its storyline is beautifully complex, surprisingly comprehensive as a whole, and features several intertwining story arcs that blend together in an impressive manner.\\n\\n\r\nDurarara!! starts off with the teenager Mikado Ryugamine and his arrival in Tokyo, where he is greeted by his childhood friend Masaomi Kida, who has lived in the city for several years now. Mikado has longed for a big city life ever since he was young, and was newly convinced by Masaomi to transfer to his current high school in Japan\u2019s capital, Tokyo. During their childhood, the two have been best friends up until Masaomi moved away, and have kept in touch through the internet ever since then. As they finally meet again in one of the biggest cities in the world, Masaomi wastes little time with catching up and immediately proceeds to show the timid Mikado around Ikebukuro. However, Mikado, still overwhelmed by the intimidating urban lifestyle prevailing throughout Tokyo, is even more stunned after realizing just how many secrets and mysteries this city actually holds.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Masaomi shows Mikado around the city, he also introduces him to a bunch of people, some friends of his, others not so much, something which can be seen as an act of setting up the exposition upon which the rest of the series will depend. Durarara!! features a lot of characters and every episode follows more than a single plotline, so it may take a while to become comfortable with the occasionally frantic pace and often perplexing storyline prevailing throughout the series, though once the first impressions settle in, it all becomes a very exciting and interesting ride, thanks to the various fascinating elements making up the story as the anime progresses.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier on, Durarara!! is a series that is very rich in characters and story arcs. As far as the protagonist goes, Mikado Ryugamine would be the obvious pick, though under the surface, things are a little more complicated than that. The first few episodes definitely focus on Mikado for the most part, developing him as a lead character and also using him as a means of constructing the exposition of the series. Once things are in place, a great deal of characters that were previously introduced come into play and several story arcs begin to take shape. On one side, there\u2019s the group of high school friends consisting of the above mentioned Mikado Ryugamine, his longtime buddy Masaomi Kida, and the voluptuous, introverted and often shy Anri Sonohara. There\u2019s an interesting, though perhaps somewhat clich\u00e9d dynamic going on between the three of them, and the full extent of their common bond only emerges towards the finale.\\n\\n\r\nAnother set of characters come into focus a little further down the line, some of the more noteworthy consisting of Shizuo Heiwajima, a bodyguard wearing a bartender\u2019s uniform and sunglasses who is widely known around Ikebukuro as the strongest man in the world, Izaya Orihara, a young and enigmatic information dealer who seems to manipulate other people for his own enjoyment\u2014he\u2019s also Shizuo\u2019s sworn enemy, and last but definitely not least, a mysterious motorcyclist known as the black rider who is often seen driving around Ikebukuro for unknown reasons\u2014rumours have it that the rider is actually headless, an allusion to the legend of the headless horseman. These are only but a few of all the characters appearing in the series, giving you sort of an idea of how expansive the world of Durarara!! is, even though the entire anime takes place in one common location: the Ikebukuro district of Tokyo.\\n\\n\r\nAs impressive as Durarara!! is on a narrative level, it also excels in the visual and sound departments. The art and animation of the series is thoroughly impressive, giving each particular character a unique appearance that contributes to making an impression on the viewer. The city of Tokyo is beautifully portrayed, and Ikebukuro is drawn in a way that gives it a special urban atmosphere, with particular attention given to the nightlife, which truly vibrates amidst the glow of streetlights and hidden secrets. Durarara!! features an art style that is a little different from the usual anime series, meaning that characters are a little more rich in detail, have a slightly different build and their specific facial traits are more accentuated. What that means is that it may take a while for some viewers to get used to this particular style, though ultimately, it fits the overall feeling of the series well.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is also complemented by solid voice acting and a very impressive and memorable soundtrack, constituting a vigorous and upbeat opening track during the first half of the show and a very evocative and somewhat melancholic one during the other half. Both songs work well and are especially catchy, never seeming to get old, even after twelve episodes have passed. Unfortunately, the two songs played during the ending sequence of the episodes are a little underwhelming and definitely do not measure up to the standards set by the ones playing during the introductory section, but that\u2019s just a small complaint, because the music tracks are still quite fitting, meaning that the mood prevailing throughout the show is never ruined.\\n\\n\r\nAs good of an anime series as Durarara!! is, it still exhibits a fair amount of flaws and imperfections along the way. The narrative power and expansiveness of the show has proved to be its strongest suit, but it has also made way to a few inconsistencies in the flow of the story, as well as a couple of unresolved plot points that have garnered over the course of the series\u2019 running time. The ending of Durarara!! feels pretty rushed, a common shortcoming among many other anime series, which will surely anger some viewers, especially considering the time the show spent on developing certain characters and plot elements. It definitely could have used one or two more episodes to properly conclude things, if you ask me. Here\u2019s to hoping that a second season will be made in the future\u2014however unlikely\u2014that will sort out some of these unresolved issues.\\n\\n\r\nIts rushed finale and partially unfinished storyline aside, Durarara!! is an excellent anime series that is unique enough and boasts plenty of originality so as to make it one of the best show of the year. It\u2019s definitely the most well-written series in a significant amount of time, featuring thoroughly intriguing characters and engaging story arcs. The way everything intertwines and relates to each other during the course of the story is quite fascinating and it\u2019s definitely interesting to see how things unfold in the end. Personally, seeing Durarara!! nail the look and feel of an urban lifestyle and depict the city of Tokyo in such a gorgeous way has sealed the deal for me, though I\u2019m sure others will find plenty of diverse things to hold on to while on a ride through the mysterious Ikebukuro.",

            "content": "From the very get-go, even from the opening title sequence, you can easily notice one thing about Durarara, and that is that it was made by Ryohgo Narita, creator of Baccano. Everything about this show besides the setting is very reminiscent of Baccano, so inevitably, it will be compared to it. So, how does DRRR hold up compared to Narita's previous work?\r\nWell, let's just get this out of the way now: No, it isn't as good as Baccano - but then, few anime are. If you're a Baccano fan, Durarara is definitely worth watching, and even if you aren't a Baccano fan, Durarara is stillworth watching, although some of the references may be lost on you, seeing as how Baccano and Durarara take place in the same fictional universe. The main difference between the two is, perhaps bizarrely given their setting, Durarara is clearly the more mature of the two series. It opts for a darker, big city underworld chic as opposed to the vibrant 30's style of Baccano. A lot of it revolves around mystery, an element not present in its predecessor.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot of Durarara is hard to sum up briefly, the premise revolves largely around Celty Sturluson, a Dullahan (read: Headless Horseman) who has lost her head, and come to Japan in search, posing as a biker. At the same time, highschool student Mikado Ryugamine is moving to Ikebokuro, after growing tired of his life in the countryside, and meets up with his internet buddy Masaomi Kida. Kida is quick to warn Mikado of the colour gangs that roam Ikebokuro, such as the Yellow Scarves and Blue Square, as well as the mysterious \"DOLLARS\", a gang claiming to be colourless. The two of them soon befriend a shy, withdrawn girl named Anri Sonohara. But as the plor develops, it becomes clear that none of these people are as simple as they seem.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the strengths of this show is the characters. Near enough every major character, and even some of the minor ones, are fascinating and distinctive characters. Celty is considered fearsome by many, though is immediately likeable and down to earth in person. Shizuo Heiwajima is an inhumanly strong man who hates violence, but is filled to the brim with unstoppable rage. Izaya Orihara is a crafty information broker who has a fondness for deranged chess motifs and knives. Shinra Kishitani is a quirky underground surgeon who has a loveably flirtatious fascination with Celty, and even minor characters like a gang of otaku who practise torture based on anime and manga add a comedic referential streak to the series, so if you're a fan of Spice and Wolf, Railgun, Dokuro-chan or Kino's Journey, expect a few giggles.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst the show is initially good, it doesn't really pick up until around a third of the way in, when it begins to move into the fast-paced action that Baccano performed to wonderfully. For most of the middle third of the series, the show is absolutely on its peak, keeping you absolutely glued to your seat wondering what will happen next. It skillfully runs through plots of Celty's missing head, a mysterious slasher attacking people, the background of the wars between the colour gangs, a medical organisation performing human experimentation, and people controlling everything from behind the scenes...\\n\\n\r\nBut as great as all of this sounds, in the third act, everything begins to fall apart. Once the slasher arc is over, most of the other plot threads are abandoned, and everything winds up revolving around the a gang war, which is a considerably weaker plot thread than the others, and at it's worst devolves into soap opera drama caused entirely by foolish decisions that could easily have been avoided. This would've at least stood up strongly if it had kept skillfully using the other storylines, but the plot of Celty's head is completely and utterly ignored as a result of this massive plot tumour. All of this builds up to an anticlimactic and lacklustre ending that gives very little closure whatsoever. The upcoming specials are set to wrap this up, but I really don't consider that a valid excuse. The only way this would be forgiveable is if there was a second season, and by the way that the specials were announced, this seems unlikely.\\n\\n\r\n(EDIT: Future seasons have rectified this dangling plot thread, but considering how much worse the later seasons were I still can't forgive it for this.)\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: At it's best, absolutely fantastic. Shame it went to waste.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: 7/10\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 7/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Baccano, Boogiepop Phantom.",

            "content": "Durarara!! is one of those shows with a double life theme, add that with some gang drama and a headless motorcyclist, and you got yourself a mashup! Which is exactly what this is. A mashup. \r\nStory: \r\nJust what I said above. This is a mashup of different cliche or used ideas. The headless motorcyclist, the gangs and mobs, the secret double life of a high schooler, and two best friends who end being on the opposite end. I was a bit disappointed in the fact there was much at the beginning but silly introductions to the characters and their profile. I don't care! They could'veeasily done the same thing while they moved through the plot. And it was a bit hard to understand why this was considered \"supernatural\" minus Shizuo having extreme strength. \\n\\n\r\nIt was decent enough, but still had so much potential.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nNot very good. Why do some of the people on the streets end up being just grey silhouettes? Now I haven't read the manga, so I don't know what the drawings look like, but the animation just seems so...sloppy. It looks like the animators got super lazy and said fuck it! Good enough. Heck! They look like they worked more on the background than the actually characters!  \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nProbably what saved this anime. The sounds in this were pretty good. They added to the suspension of the scene and drew the watcher in. The two opening songs were spot on and prepared the watcher for what was too come. Kudos to the soundtrack team! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say really. These characters are pretty much based off of other characters from classics, although they are pretty well thought up and they do have their own personality. No sterotypes, although Mikado was a bit of a goody too shoes. My favourite had to be Shizuo of course. The way he got when Izaya came around was hilarious! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: \\n\\n\r\n50th anime watched! I really didn't get into this until around episode 17/18. The first few episodes were a bit too dull for my taste. It seemed to be repeating itself over and over...I got bored. No lies. \\n\\n\r\nI give this 52.5% on the fighting level.\\n\\n",

            "content": "In many ways, watching anime might be just like listening to music for me. \r\nI have been taught to never have any prejudices and give an honest chance to everything that comes my way. \r\nObviously, when it's bad ten seconds into the song, you simply know it will stink the rest of the time and drop it. You rarely even regret it afterwards (let me stress the case is somewhat different with other forms of art, like literature, which is perceived somewhat slower and more methodical).\r\nAs for Durarara, and for my most beloved songs, novels, and other works, the key is an immediate impact andan impression that lingers. \\n\\n\r\nSure, what I have written so far only has to do with personal preferences. \\n\r\nBut if I would want to convince you to watch Durarara disregarding my own taste (and I really want to convince people!), I wouldn't have a clue which aspects of this anime to present before you with persuasive intents, because I like it as a fully accomplished work of art in which there is good music, well-developed characters, snappy plot, etc.\\n\\n\r\nWell aware that I am praising an anime which is yet to be completed (thus I feel reluctant to go into details such as animation and environments) I figured, why not simply say: try it and see for yourselves that I am right! Think about those moments as you hear a song for the first time and immediately know it will never leave you. This is exactly the same. This is like Death Note. Or Ergo Proxy. Or Tengen Toppa Gurenn Lagann. Clannad. Samurai Champloo. \\n\r\nAnd all other animes which grant you new and intellectually intense perspectives.\\n\\n\r\nStill three episodes into it I can totally agree with the first reviewer \u2014 this will be, and most likely already is, one of the best animes for 2010.",

            "content": "I recently watched the popular show, Durarararararara!! and I have to say, it was quite enjoyable, with a few flaws/annoying parts. Durarara is a very unique show that contains a whole lot of different genres mixed together; romance, comedy, supernatural, mystery, and even some action here and there. I've never seen a show hop around all over the place, in terms of plot. In this review, I may blab nonsense, but I'll try to explain why I like Durarara.\r\nIn order for me to describe the plot, it would take forever because there's just so much happening in Durarara to a whole load of different maincharacters. So I'll sum it up using Mikado Ryugamine (mainest of the main characters, I think) as the focal point. Mikado Ryugamine longs for an escape from his dull everyday life and seeks something to make his young, short life stand out from the rest, resulting in him moving to Ikebukuro, a \"crazy\" to say the least city in Japan. He hopes life in one of Japan\u2019s most trendy commercial and entertainment cities can satiate his thirst for excitement and a little danger. But soon he discovers Ikebukuro is more than up to the task. An inhumanly powerful bartender, a skilled underground informant, a mysterious motorcyclist dubbed the Black Rider, an aggressively enterprising Russian sushi chef, along with all sorts of gangs are the least threatening people when there are more sinister plots simmering just beneath the surface of this urban jungle. \\n\\n\r\nThere really was no general plot to the story, each episode the perspective changes, meaning that the episodes are told in 1st person, by various characters. Certainly there were moments when I wondered, \"Where's the story headed?\", but in the end it was all answered. Each episode had a specific parallel supernatural mystery that initially appears oblique, but in the end all the mysteries are cleverly intertwined with one another, leading up to a satisfying ending. Durarara has quite a few cleverly surprising revelations and twists that had skillful misdirection, which constantly keeps the viewer guessing. Yet when expectations are heightened, the series likes to pull back, lower the tension, and make the climax seem unimportant. A thing I liked about the series is that it recognizes the important role that internet chat rooms, online associations, cell phones, and text messaging have in teenagers\u2019 social lives. Yet it also finds opportunities to tap into that adolescent pastime of discontent with the mundane everyday. I can't relate with the overall story, because it's so unrealistic, but I can definitely relate with the main character's feelings. With that said, there are also a few things I didn't like about Durarara: \\n\\n\r\n- Bad pacing; some episodes (20+ min) were dedicated to unimportant characters, and not on main characters. \\n\r\n- Plot is supposed to be dark, and mature, but it came out to be too bright, and naive.\\n\r\n- A couple moments when viewers are left to think, \"This doesn't even make sense...\" \\n\r\n- Way too much narration\\n\r\n- Main Character was annoying, and not very heroic, though the anime tried to portray him as so in the end(personal thought). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters is where Durarara shined best. The great appeal of Durarara is its diverse and colorful mix of personalities of numerous characters. During each episode, there's strang conversations on a chat in the computer, about the developing plot. I'll explain the mainest 5 characters in detail, but there are many more interesting characters that are thoroughly developed in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nMikado Ryugamine, the mainest of main characters is a polite, soft spoken boy, whom at times can be quite childish and naive. At first he is scared of all the chaos happening in Ikebukuro, but as the series progresses, Mikado gradually becomes more and more assertive, and eventually becomes able to able to accept the chaos that life throws at him without attempting to run away. With that said, despite his kindness and naivety, Mikado is much more ruthless and manipulative than he appears to be and is very capable at using intimidation to reach his goals. \\n\\n\r\nMasaomi Kida is Mikado's best [childhood] friend, and is a resident in Ikebukuro. He is one of the reasons Mikado moved to Ikebukuro, and while Mikado is in Ikebukuro, Masaomi acts like a big brother, protector. He is a rather cheerful boy (in public) and is always enthusiastic about picking-up girls, but seems to be a failure at it. As the series progresses, it is revealed that Masaomi's enthusiastic, happy-go-lucky demeanor is actually a mask of his true, much less secure self. He appears to agonize over major choices much more than any other character in the series, although he falls just short of being paralyzed by his fears. His background is explained in depth, and his true nature was a surprising twist in the plot. \\n\\n\r\nAnri Sonohara is a introverted and quiet girl, whom Mikado falls in love with. As the series progresses, she retains her shy personality, though her interactions with Mikado and Masaomi serve to pull her out of her emotional shell and she becomes much more expressive and shows a caring side to those close to her. The friendship she develops with Mikado and Masaomi was a treat to watch, something I could sort of relate with. Another character that the plot uses as a crazy, surprising plot twist. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character, Izaya Orihara. Izaya is a powerful, skilled, and snake-like informant, who is actually much more than just an informant. He claims to love the human race, excluding Shizuo Heiwajima whom Izaya likes to start fights. He greatly enjoys putting people in miserable or chaotic situations in order to observe their reactions. He plays chess in a bizarre fashion and the undiscloed rules he plays seem to be a metaphor for the way he lives his life. Izaya throughout the anime seemed like a \"god\" figure, because he always helped/protected people, but in a manner that makes him seem like an evil \"tester\". Anyways, very enjoyable character to watch for.\\n\\n\r\nShizuo Heiwajima is renowned as the strongest man in Ikebukuro. Shizuo apparently doesn't really like violence and has misgivings about his own strength; unfortunately, he has a very short temper and when angered, his body \"acts on its own\" and he beats everyone up. Shizuo is a very funny character who uses violence to cancel out violence... or when he's just pissed off... or if he sees Izaya. Shizuo Vs Izaya was a constant battle throughout the anime that was really fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nCelty Sturluson is a Dullahan, an unseelie fairy from Ireland who came to Japan looking for her stolen head (yes, she's headless). Celty's personality is, ironically, one of the most normal and down to earth out of the entire cast. Celty was certainly a character I personally did not enjoy. Celty, a badass who starts off with mysterious potential ends up becoming a useless, weak, and headless babe (always one in an anime...) who falls in love with a scientist. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's just the start of it, the list goes on and on, showing how much in detail Durarara focused on \"characters\". There should be at least one character that the audience can relate to. So, if you're wondering why I wrote useless information in my review, it was to represent how diverse and strong the \"characters\" were in Durarara.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the opening songs of Durarara were also unique and nice to listen to; I never skipped the openings while I watched the anime. The \"jazz\"iness in the anime certainly fit the mood of the anime throughout. The voicing was superb, each character's voice fitting their respective personalities. Izaya's voice, quiet yet manipulative and ominous, Shizuo's voice powerful, and deep, Mikado's voice, innocent and normal. The art was solid. The depiction of Ikebukuro is very accurate to the real city in real life actually. Each character had their own uniqueness. Overall very solid. The art style was certainly a bit different from the average anime though, in a sense that you have to watch the anime to understand.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: I like it, so I'd recommend others to watch it as well. Heh, thanks for reading!~",

The creators have given me a lot of reasons to be satisfied so early into the series, and that's a mean feat considering how long it takes even some of the best anime to get up to speed.\r\nThe sheer amount of awesome in this show boggles the brain. The characters are the baddest of asses and every single one, bar none, is interesting and complex. One of my favorite character introductions is in the first episode: a vending machine rockets through the air and we're told, \"dudes,that's Shizuo, stay the hell away from him.\" And I probably would, but Shizuo is awesome. As is every other character in this remarkable cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe creators, who are also responsible for \"Baccano!\" (as by now you've heard), play with time in a similar way in this series. We may revisit the same moment from the perspectives of several different characters, but we're never lost, and it's certainly never like \"oh, this shit again, I didn't care the first time and I don't want to see it again.\" We know just enough to orient us, but we still haven't seen quite enough and are left yet with mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great, subtle when necessary, and the intro song is both an appropriately energetic introduction to the show and an awesome song in its own right.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, and sometimes most impressively, the art doesn't get in the way of the anime.

            "content": "I guess the most natural response would be to call this show a train wreck, but that would imply\n1.  There would have to be a train in one piece.\n2.  It would have to be on a set of railroad tracks.\n3.  It would have to be capable of moving in some direction.\nDurarara!! is more like starting off with all of the train cars scattered across the yard, then having an earthquake and expecting them to somehow find each other AND put themselves in the correct order.  (Nevermind getting on a track AND traveling somewhere.)\nTo put it in layman's terms:  DRRR isa mess.  There is no logical flow or coherence or reason in events that happen throughout the course of the series.  I wonder what \"Durarara\" actually means; if I were to venture a guess, I'd say \"crazy shit happening why because it's cool does it make sense no but that's okay because it's cool.\"  In the first two episodes alone, they introduce a number of characters not much less than two dozen.  How many of them actually end up being significant?  Well, not many.  How many of them is it possible to care for?  Not many.  Then why the hell are we wasting so much screentime?  No idea.\\n\\n\nThe pacing makes absolutely no sense.  In the first 7-8 episodes, nothing of any real importance happens at all: just a bunch of tiny events that one would think COULD be setting the stage for much more important things later on, but really aren't.  Basically, all they do is establish the fact that \"this is our city and crazy shit happens sometimes.\"  Well, ain't that wonderful.  It took you that long?  When things DO finally start happening, they come out of nowhere, get dropped and forgotten abruptly, picked up again just as abruptly, and end anticlimacticly in some aesop... er, cute little outro about how \"things went back to normal\" for them er... whatever.  Yeah, in a city where crazy shit is supposed to be a regularity?  Guess how long that lasts.  These little expositions simply serve as bookends that define where one arc ends and another begins.  They may as well just say, \"Okay this arc is over now; time for the next one,\" and it would have the same effect.\\n\\n\nThe writers obviously have no clue about what the concepts of buildup and foreshadowing are.  Granting for the sake of argument that there is in fact a complete train on the tracks and it is in fact in motion, the train is screeching and lurching and starting and stopping and running off the tracks then back ON the tracks and skipping stations randomly and...  Well, you get the idea.  Here's one example:  Out of nowhere, it is revealed that some dude started a group called the Dollars.  There is absolutely ZERO allusion that this may have been the case previously; ZERO hints dropped to get us thinking.  Nope.  They just throw the fact in your face when it becomes relevant and expect you to accept it.  Why did he do it?  BECAUSE HE WAS BORED.\\n\\n\nThat brings me to another problem:  Characterization occurs as the plot demands.  Suddenly, CRAZY SHIT HAPPENING OMG WTF WHY.  What's that?  It's all about some character who seemed completely insignificant until now?  Uh-oh.  Time for a flashback.  --5 minutes later--  \"And that's how he/she got to where they are today\" or \"this is the secret he/she has been hiding.\"  Er... wut?  'Scuse you?  Another example:  Suddenly, the guy with superhuman strength is saying that he's always hated his powers.  Wait, what?  He's been using them liberally on people, in front of people the entire show, and hasn't seemed to care in the slightest.  Okay...  There also seems to be a character who they were occasionally, half-assedly trying to paint as some type of MASTER OF PUPPETS AND I PULL YOUR STRINGS, but it's honestly impossible to tell whether he had any REAL significant role in the matters at hand or not.\\n\\n\nThe more I think about it, the more DRRR reminds me of Guilty Crown--in that GC ALSO likes to throw a shitstorm at you and then try to explain it as though it made sense afterwards.  (Oh gawd; drawing parallels to Guilty Crown; not a good sign.)  At least DRRR doesn't do it to quite an extreme degree.\\n\\n\nThe only exception to this trend is the case of one person whom they actually do a half-decent job dropping hints about the possibilities of his past and connections.  Why couldn't they do that for everyone else?\\n\\n\n*sigh*  Anyway, on to sound and art.  The OPs and EDs leave a bad taste in my mouth; there's no other way to describe it.  The OST is composed entirely of a bunch of slow, nonchalant, beep-boopidy xylophone tracks that sound pretty much the same--regardless of the events transpiring on screen.  No, actually, I think it's the SAME EXACT SONG over and over again.  (At least it sounds like it.)  The animation is generally pretty nice, although some big corners are cut at points--usually action sequences.  One time, a mob of generic, unimportant people (signified by the fact that they're completely gray) is attacking someone, and they all somehow morph together into one giant amorphous BLOB.  Seriously, guys: they're all gray.  At LEAST draw some lines in there so it looks like they haven't turned into some monster out of a '50s B-stock horror film.\\n\\n\nSo why the hell is DRRR's mean score so high?  Your guess is honestly as good as mine.  To its credit, it DOES have come pretty cool characters (Shizuo, Izaya, and Celty [rest are trash]), and there ARE some cool moments (almost always revolving around one of these 3 characters).  (Again, seriously: why do we spend so much time looking at dumb/pointless characters?  If they had just capitalized on the decent ones...)  Crispin Freeman and Johnny Yong Bosch put on a great show as always.  But that's it.  Some cool points.\\n\\n\nOH I ALMOST FORGOT.  They seem to REALLY enjoy throwing the word \"love\" around in the show A LOT.  No, I don't think you get it.  They do it.  A.  LOOOOOOTTTT.  There's this whole ordeal about a guy who \"falls in love\" with a head in a jar.  His obsession is nothing less than what can be classified clinically as a mental illness.  Love WHAT?  And that's not even the HALF of that story.  Seriously some of the most screwed up shit I've ever heard.  If I recall correctly, there's exactly ONE situation where the word is used that isn't mind-bendingly perverse or nauseatingly messed up.\\n\\n\nThe series really isn't very memorable in any way.  I've already forgotten most of what happened (except for the seemingly important stuff and cool doods).  Hell, I've already forgotten most of what happened in the episodes I watched just LAST NIGHT.  I think 17 episodes is more than enough to base an accurate review off of; if, after 17 episodes, it's still so physically painful to keep watching the show, then for the sake of my mental state, I refuse to keep going.",

            "content": "\"Just because I like humans doesn't mean I like you personally\" -Izaya\nDurarara is able to to keep you entertained for each entire episode. The art isn't so good as the colors are dull and the character's faces are often expressionless. On the other hand, both openings and endings were awesome.\nSimply put, Durarara!! is a show that attempts anything and everything. It seeks ensemble-based drama with enough humorous peripheral characters to lighten its load (and some romances thrown in for good measure), and in its spare moments delves into the supernatural and attempts a meta-fictional perspective on 21st century Japanese culture. The series throws development afterdevelopment at the audience, fascinating one with modernized takes on Irish folk tales, introducing a myriad of strange characters. Durarara!! is a frustrating show to watch, one whose core story is too light on weight to work and whose levity relies too much on the slapstick and obscure cultural references, and one whose most interesting aspects seem peripheral, with the stories of secondary characters and the framework of the show itself outdoing the rather bland leads in interest.\\n\\n\nThe musical score, meanwhile, was always a welcome listen, and the mix of free jazz, atmospheric vibraphone tracks, and piano pieces perfectly suited the show's quirky intent, with the pieces being well-placed if occasionally a bit repetitive. A show that frustrates is often one whose failings prove to still be interesting, and all things considered, most episodes of Durarara!! have at least one surprising quirk somewhere that makes them worth watching, even if the level of innovation is not sustained across the full episode. The series makes too many blunders for its story to leave much of a lasting impact, and its meandering moments becoming intolerably tedious at times, but the entirety, in spite of being unsatisfying, does have something of a distinct charm that keeps it slightly on the positive side of mediocrity.\\n\\n\nDurarara!!, meanwhile, introduces as many sub-plots as it does characters, with several remaining unresolved at series' end and various cliffhangers and tantalizing pauses leaving one curious for more and subsequently dismayed at the lack of closure. Characters sometimes act illogically, with the villainous sometimes too-easily re-integrating themselves into society and the main trio being given back stories that, while obviously designed to dramatically and stunningly bring the various \"clues\" the series drops early on into a cohesive whole, seem uncharacteristic and tacked on as a way to generate personality without really giving them any really depth. The end result is a story that feels much less of a triumph than it could have been, and even a surprisingly effective ending never covers up the show's lack of answers, reliance on flimsy plot-twists to maintain interest, and tepid moments brought about when the creators lie uncomfortably between bullet points in a plot summary, the flow having temporarily vanished and the audience being left with the bare bones of a fascinating but awkwardly presented thesis.\\n\\n\nMy overall score is 8.\\n\nPlease give me your feedback.\\n",

            "content": "What do you get when you take Baccano!, replace all interesting characters with angsty teens and characters defined by their repititious actions (one guy throws vending machines when angry, but hates violence - this is considered the equivalent of a \"personality\"), restrict it from killing anyone; even random extras, and have all feelings expressed through narration - given, otherwise you wouldn't have been able to tell?\r\nYou get Durarara!!. This show is awful. It's the child-friendly Baccano!, with complete disregard to the factor that Baccano! *was never meant for children*. If Baccano! had a disturbed and forbidden lovechild with Bleach, and that lovechild had a tumor,it would be Durarara!.\\n\\n\r\nStory (1/10):\\n\r\nI think this was a rough draft of a short story Narita wrote in high school. One day, Narita looked at it and said \"I should show this to someone.\" So, he approaches a random stranger on the streets and says \"Hey! Check this out!\"\\n\r\nStranger, bafflled by the current situation, agrees. After reading 3 pages, he gives his reaction:\\n\r\n\"Wow! This is really good!\" he declares, handing the pages back, \"B!TCH!\" - Oops, I forgot to mention it, but the stranger had tourettes. And couldn't really read narita's handwriting. \"FVCK SALT! THAT WAS AWESOME!\"\\n\r\nWith his newfound confidence, he turned it into his publisher. The published kinda-sorta skimmed the pages, but didn't really read it. As the editors trudged through it, they often found themselves bored and uninterested. By the 50th page, they decided to just give up and go get doughnuts.\\n\\n\r\nThis is how the anime came to be. It's not very good. In fact, it's not good at all. Everything that happens is merely a means for getting from Point A to Point B, then Point B to Point C. And Point C is actually Point A, so, in the end, no matter how many times it goes from one point to the next, it always ends up going nowhere.\\n\r\nIt follows the idea of jumping from perspective to perspective, similar to Baccano!, but it always tells us how something happens, or how a character is feeling, yet never shows us anything as back up. You can tell me a character has a special relationship with someone as many times as you like, but if all you ever show them doing together is walking around with a dreadfully bored expression, I'm not going to believe it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10):\\n\r\nPretty standard animation. Pretty boring. Only thing that stands out is the gray extras, and they're only gray 'cause they're boring.\\n\r\nCharacters are often stilted or seen doing the same thing with a different background.\\n\r\nCoolest bit of animation was epic mouse-moving, but that's also a pretty boring action.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/20):\\n\r\nVoice acting was okay.\\n\r\nBland pop music.\\n\r\nSounds usually sounded like they should. Kinda.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2/10):\\n\r\nAll the characers were about as deep as your standard Zetsubou Sensei character. Unfortunately, they were trying to be deep, yet Zetsubou Sensei's characters are intetionally 2-dimensional.\\n\r\nThey're all defined by one trait. With 24 episodes, none of the characters accomplish anything. What was the point of watching them? They only do their specific action repeatedly, and they only talk about their one, insignifacant - often nonsensical - motivation.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (1/10):\\n\r\nThere were a couple points toward the beginning that were entertaining, but the majority was generic trash.\\n\r\n-Spoilers-\\n\r\nGang war plot? Leaders of gangs are best friends? Never seen that before. But wait! There's more! THERE'S A THIRD ONE?!?! That's still not creative! It certainly didn't need to be dragged out for 8 episodes, only to end with 3 charactes hugging eachother while crying \"I'm sorry!\" \"No, I'm Sorry!\" \"No, I was wrong! I'm sorryer!\" WAH~!!\\n\r\nThat's not even a climax, and I saw it coming 2 episodes into the story arce - except I didn't expect it to be that bad. It's not even worth watching.\\n\r\n-End spoilers-\\n\\n\r\nOverall (3/10):\\n\r\nDon't bother. Baccano! S2, please?",

            "content": "Before you click the \"not helpful\" tab, let me say something. I wrote this review at the start of the series, and made a bunch of predictions on how it will turn out, but I'm confident that I won't have to change any of the content in this review, even after the show ends. I'm as sure about the general structure and potential of this show as I possibly can be. (It's all here in this pamphlet *passes around*)\r\nI've now seen 10 episodes, and I could see how this was destined to go (not where, the two are different). It becomes very apparent that thisseries is formulated much like Baccano!. Which makes sense, since they share a common maker. Let me start by saying, if you want to find out about the story, read the synopsis, my job is to tell you what you can expect to come from the story.\\n\\n\r\nBut enough with the chit chat, what can I tell you about Durarara?\\n\\n\r\nNow, giving a review after 10 episodes is hardly a review, what am I reviewing? All I can, that's what!\\n\\n\r\nHere is what I can say about Durarara, it's all in the style, in the opening, and in the way the show is played out.\\n\\n\r\nThe openings in anime are often used as some sort of extra bit of animation, often just put together for purpose of killing a couple minutes before the show starts. Durarara is different. Every character is highlighted, and each (again, this is insight from having seen Baccano) will play an integral part to the plot. And if you watch the opening, you'll see there's a lot of characters introduced there, and it's somewhat difficult to follow. The purpose is not to introduce you to these chracters, but to have you reflect on what events are happening in the opening, after watching the show. Which is incredibly interesting and enveloping. You can take in everything about the show from the opening, but it's done in such a way there's no way to understand until it's been introduced. And this perhaps, is one of Durarara's greatest strengths.\\n\\n\r\nIt's all in the style. And it's style is like Baccano!'s only in the sense that, it involves a myriad of characters, each interesting and intriguing, whose stories are all interwoven into each others. Again, I am basing all my assumptions of this on my viewing of Baccano!, but I'd be willing to wager that each character's story will be introduced seperately, with the chronology of the events somewhat a mystery at first, rising to crescendo and then climaxing at the end in a fantastic accomplishment of plot and storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is fairly dark, which is seems to suck you in. An interesting point is that all the background people are simple shades of grey. The city is dark, full of night life, but carrying a sense of anticipation, excitement, amusement, and danger. Things feel very realistic, and at the same time, there's something going on behind the scenes that teases us with an element of our usual anime supernaturality. The same could be said about the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other thing I can say about the show at this point is the music. Durarara's soundtrack has already wowed me with it's elegant subtlety. The bass guitar plucking each note in scenes of tension. Each scene's mood is completely set by the background music, flowing beautifully, and establishing a mood.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can say Durarara is a tapestry being woven, where we are to inspect each section as an individual, and only at the end, evaluate it as a whole. And when this event occurs, we will see how each individual thread conforms to create an impressive and awe-inspiring image, which will be worth gazing at again and again, noticing subtle nuances with each new glance.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that, is Durarara. It is an cognitive, psychological excursion beyond our normal realm of understanding. I appreciate that I have told you very little as to who is in the show, but understand a show isn't about who, it's about what \"who\" does, and what is going on around \"who.\" And I've told you all I can about that. I'll once again say, this is all a prediction, one I feel very confident in, but a prediction nonetheless. I've based it off of work from the author previously. It might not turn out that way, but just like with a series of books, you can know whether or not you'll enjoy the next few by whether you'd enjoyed the first.",

            "content": "Watched the dub so that's what I'm reviewing.\r\nThe anime often shows you seemingly useless information, and at times following the flashbacks are very hard. The first few episodes were very slow, and not that engaging, and while it finished very well, the journey to that was less engaging.\r\nThe story and character interactions are very well strung together, perhaps too well at points, the flashbacks are sometimes a little hard to follow and the un centred nature of the anime made following the plot sometimes challenging. This anime isn't something that you can really attach 'antagonist' labels to something, while it's an understatement to say it'smostly the characters messing around with each other - it's probably a good summary.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation wasn't particularly high quality. The greying of non important characters was fine really, and helped you focus on what you were meant to, but most of the quieter scenes were animated very basically. Not so much as to detract from the story, but it lowered the engagement nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in the dub was very good, but the sound tracks were very heavily over used and to me they were getting clich\u00e9 by the end, such was the number of times I had heard them.\\n\\n\r\nI also personally didn't like the narrative style. Often what a character was thinking was literally said out loud, and the actual narrator was sometimes a character from the story and sometimes external. Without a very good ability to memorise an attribute the voices, following who was narrating what was hard, and the style of the fairly frequent narration lost any implicit messages. Everything was dictated to you like they didn't want you to miss it, and while all this information tied up brilliantly towards the end, it felt a little forced to me watching it at the start.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of pulling a surprise back story out of nowhere didn't really bother me, nor so much the characters/plot itself, more so the way in which it was presented.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the animation quality might be quite low, and the episodes at the start aren't that engaging, the anime does tie up nicely and deliver on the ending.",

Durarara is a piece of metafiction that primarily explores youth culture in Japan although much of its revelations and developments are relatable or can be extrapolated into the Western world. What is particularly impressive is that all this social commentary comes slickly packaged in a character drama whose comedy, romance, supernatural conceptions and eclectic cast can be appreciatedeven if one were to ignore the underlying purpose of them all. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you\u2019re willing to commit to Durarara, you will find there is an inexplicably larger amount of satisfaction to derive from than those who decide not to. I say this because Durarara is an incredibly complex story as it comprises of a large ensemble cast, all of whom play fundamental roles in the story which itself is told in a non-linear fashion. The storytelling is done in such a way that different parts of the story are experienced through the perspectives of a diverse set of characters which ranges from insatiable high-schoolers to eccentric Russian sushi chefs and a mythical motorcyclist. Throughout the show, viewers will be exposed to seemingly tangential subplots but as one would expect, they do all coalesce and are components of the story. Durarara's brilliance lies partly in this artistically inventive mode of storytelling which enables the show to carry a sophisticated narrative without feeling overbearing or convoluted because each episode or sequence is being narrated by new key characters that are still being introduced far down the story line which keeps each episode fresh and fascinating.\\n\\n\r\nWithin the space of 24 episodes, an enormous quantity of information is being relayed to the viewers and Durarara excels at juggling all its characters and subplots, giving the right amount of focus for all our characters. But it is precisely because the story is so hectic that it requires your full attention because all the supposedly \u201cirrelevant\u201d subplots and interactions are all elements that will be drawn upon much later on even into the second season. It is crucial to note that the notion of \u201cseasons\u201d is a purely economic one \u2013 the story doesn't suddenly \u201cconclude\u201d in the first season. Durarara is a singular piece of fiction based on light novels and whilst the show has arcs, the relevance of the show\u2019s arcs do not stop when the respective arc ends. Despite this, its ending does feel wholesome and it deftly executes the conclusion in such a manner that it could very well stand alone as an individual work.\\n\\n\r\nThe fundamental essence of Durarara is that of a supernatural Ikebukuro where the story is set. Indeed, Ikebukuro is the only one thing that connects all our characters and their plots. The series\u2019 presentation of modern society and youth can be seen by both its aesthetics, conceptions and the inclusion of the Internet. These exist to explore a whole host of ideas such as but not limited to: the notion of identity, especially in a world of anonymity, reality (or at least the perception of) and power and its various forms. But it does so by elegantly weaving this into the story rather than shoving these themes down your throat. Durarara vastly distinguishes itself from the rest by creating a consistently engaging fictional universe that emulates reality, where all these aspects exist and can be further delved into, instead of the usual attempts that feel artificial because it is evident that every creation of the story exists solely to explore a specific theme, sacrificing realism and preventing any semblance of transcendence from a work of fiction. I feel Durarara does transcend; it understands that there is no \u201cmain character\u201d in real life as we are all individuals living our own lives and in an increasingly connected world, there are bound to be overlaps. And if you have a cast like the one Narita has created, then you have one hell of a story.\\n\\n\r\nA show\u2019s universe is never complete without complementary audio-visuals. The soundtrack is a quirky, snappy and a primarily light-hearted score produced by a combination of piano and jazz instruments. It no doubt helps to construct Durarara's version of Ikebukuro and is unique although nothing too special, in my opinion. Conversely, I must mention that the OPs are outstanding and both OPS are of my personal favourites. Visually, the show is nothing too spectacular. The background and setting emulate much of real life Ikebukuro and the colour palette is wonderfully vibrant to match. The character designs are wholly distinct for each one and cement each character\u2019s idiosyncrasies and general traits - the abundance of Durarara artwork in the anime community acts as a testament to how beloved the character designs are.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Durarara is a multi-dimensional, fast-paced and innovative drama which successfully blends mystery, the supernatural, comedy, romance and social commentary. I feel that there is something for most people in this show with its diverse cast and multitude of subplots although much of the entertainment can be missed if you look for quick satisfaction. In which case, it may not be for you because the show definitely takes its time to explore itself and its many themes. If any of the aforementioned descriptions do appeal to you or you\u2019re simply looking for a distinct experience that encompasses a wide range of genres, then much like one of our characters, you may look to relocate yourself in this electrifying world that is Ikebukuro.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ikebukuro is one crazy ass town set in one crazy ass country that produced one crazy ass series of novels that now has a crazy ass anime adaptation, now replace \"crazy ass\" with \"entertaining\".\r\nSTORY: Durarara (Or DRRR, which by the way sounds like an insult to someone when they make a stupid or obvious statement) can be described as two things: crazy and entertaining, and entertaining and crazy. Durarara is as crazy as it is entertaining, I mean what other anime has gang wars, superhuman people, super natural elements, and enough characters pushed up into like several clown cars, packed up like sardines, that startto break the hinges and screws start flying off... I can name one other but anyway, Durarara is the adaptation of light novels created by Ryohgo Narita, the creator of another crazy ass series named Baccano (Which there is only one other series I can compare that one too).\\n\\n\r\nBut seriously, I must applaud this novel writer, who now has two well loved series under his belt that both received great anime adaptations, that's right I'll say it right now, Durarara is a great anime, great as in entertaining, with an early competent story and a huge cast of wonderful and unique characters.\\n\r\nThe story is about... mostly everyone! Just about all the characters receive a good bit of devoted screen time and get to narrate an episode, and you should be intimidated by what I mean by \"everyone\" as Durarara just has too many to write about in one review, so I'll just write about the most interesting ones, and the \"main\" characters, as the third half focuses entirely on those certain set of \"main\" characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't really straight forward but mostly character driven, the entire anime can be summed up into three parts: The first 1/3 is the slow start, building up the characters and establishing many elements of the series, the second 1/3 is pay off of the start up, fantastic and fun moments are all found here folks with a lot of the more interesting characters featured the most, and then finally the last 1/3, the umm, lamest part of the anime...\\n\\n\r\nThe first third of the anime is spend mostly introducing characters and establishing bits of story elements for the latter part of the anime with Mikado, the seemingly main character of Durarara and his friends Kida, his childhood friend, and Anri, a well endowed girl with a quite interesting back story. It's pretty slow to say the least, but it's all worth it later on.\\n\r\nThe second third of the anime is the real meat of the entire anime, with the build up from earlier episodes, but the real reason is because the majority of the focus is on the more interesting characters like Celty, the headless Dullahan from Ireland who drives a black motorcycle around the city, Shizuo Heiwajima, the one guy in the dangerous city full of many dangerous people that you don't want to mess with, and other characters related to them in some fashion.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the last third of the anime is where I wouldn't mind to say there's no point on continuing further, unless you're a completest or have been enjoying the show to this point and want to continue. The story quickly shifts from being creative unique character driven story to a very lame teen drama involving gangs, with the focus being the most bland group of characters of the entire anime (Like Mikado and Kida), with the villain having the charisma of a random background character (And looks and starts out like one too). \\n\r\nI would consider calling this part of Durarara, DRRR, as it's sort of an insult to be stripped of all the greatest parts by the end of the anime, sure the other characters do have their moments (Like Shizuo tearing shit up), and bad moments too (Shizuo learns that he too be taken out by simple measures just like everyone else, and of course, the teen drama), but there is still worth while parts (A certain a**hole gets whats coming to him, and damn is it satisfying).\\n\\n\r\nThough it's a shame Durarara mostly ends on a low note rather than a high one, but it blows it's load early on, and it might be a good idea to pretend it's only like 13 or 16 episodes like it's predecessor adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Very unique and stylish, with character designs by Suzuhito Yasuda (The original artist for the novels and creator of manga series Yozakura Quartet). Apparently the original creator of Durarara wants consistency that even the studio that made Baccano, Brains Base, is also the one behind the production.\\n\r\nThe animation is great, and the character designs are diverse enough to compliment their personalities and quirks (Of course a headless girl wouldn't need a detailed personality to stand out from the crowd), but most of them look rather generic, and the later part of the anime looks noticeably lower budget.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: With both a japanese and english voice over for Durarara available, I would recommend going your preference language to listen to since both languages are fine, however, I would give a more slight nod to the japanese voice over simply because the setting is Japan, and the english dub voice actors tend to be stumped by a japanese word when it would appear in dialogue, overall both have their stellar performances that only each language provides.\\n\r\nThe theme music are great, especially the first opening, but as the later part of anime becomes blander, so does the theme music.\\n\r\nThe background music is mostly loud jazz music, that seems out of place at times.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ A unique and great character driven story.\\n\r\n+ Diverse cast of interesting characters.\\n\r\n+ Both japanese and english voice overs are equally great.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- The last third of the anime is disappointing, with too much focus on the bland characters.\\n\r\n- The technical side also suffers at the later end of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs an added bonus, Durarara also has many cameos of several different anime thrown about, so be sure to pay attention to the back grounds and what figures and manga you'll see.",

            "content": "For anybody trying to decide on whether or not they should watch Durarara, do yourself a favor and watch it. This anime is easily one of the best I've ever seen. The story starts off a little slow with a shy and timid boy named Mikado moving to new city in Japan who has high hope to start a new life. from there the story takes off. The anime stays pretty consistent with presenting new information and ideas, and easily keeps your attention. As far as story goes it is one of the most well thought out, complex, developed, and mature plots I've ever hadthe pleasure of watching. When I say mature I don't mean that there are breasts bouncing around everywhere or anything else ecchi like that, but mature as in you have to have some type of common sense to keep up with whats going on, which is another thing I love about this anime.It is not the type of story where everything is laid out on silver platter for you. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWithin the very first seconds of this anime you know that the illustrators took pride in what they were doing. Every scene is intricately drawn to keep the audience entertained, whether you may be looking at a vibrant and colorful vending machine flying across the sky, or a dark and mysterious alleyway waiting for you to make the mistake of deciding to take the shortcut home.9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are experienced when it comes to watching and anime you know that the soundtracks in the anime can make or break it. Fortunately for Durarara they knew exactly what they were doing. For an anime to have such a wide variety of genres they spread it out extremely well to compliment every scene needing an extra push of anxiety, calmness, happiness, or anger. Durarara isn't the type of anime to leave you crying at the sound of some beautiful soundtrack but you will definitely catch yourself at the edge of your seat while yelling something to a  character attempting to do something that could potentially lead to their demise. This anime features genres everywhere from Rock all the way to Classical or Pop so you don't need to worry about getting bored with the soundtracks although you will be able to associate some of the soundtracks with a certain type of scene. -Every time I started an episodes I would always listened to the opening at least twice just because I liked it so much :)-. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom the beginning of this anime you are constantly given new information about every character, whether it may be told to you straight forward or something you discover on your own by untwisting the plot. What I am trying to say is that you immediately start to form some type of relationship and, or bond with every character in the show. There is constantly new character development so you don't have to worry about getting bored with one character. Another thing I like about this anime is that you are given the opportunity to see things in another characters eyes besides the protagonist. This is a very great technique to give the audience a chance to get to know a character because you are seeing exactly how they think instead of just seeing the main character perception on that person. Every character in the anime played an important and irreplaceable role. They all add their own little spin to the plot which keeps you interested in how the story may change once you learn something new about a character. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs far as enjoyment goes just try to stop watching this anime in the middle of a big part of one of the charter's arch. I can tell you that I stayed up until 3am even though I knew I had to get up at 6:40am simply because I did not have it in me to call it quits. Every episodes leaves you wanting more so if you are worried about not being able to get through this anime you should be more worried about stopping once you've started. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is nothing short of a master piece. There is only one thing that I really wanted to happen that didn't. If you are looking for a serious anime but you want to laugh I wholeheartedly encourage you to give this one a try. 10/10 Thanks for reading guys ^__^ (by the way this is my first review)\\n\\n\r\nTk\\n\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER BELOW\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen I said there was only one thing that didn't happen that I wanted to happen it was Mikado and Anri not getting together. His excuse was that he wanted to wait for Kida to come back to try and make a move even though Kida got back with his old girlfriend and left. -__-\\n",

            "content": "Trying to figure out how to write a review about this in a way that made sense, the best I could come up with is that this feels like an attempt to imitate Baccano while conforming it to much more normal anime standards and tropes. \r\nThe reason that Baccano is phenomenal is that it ignores many of these standards and focuses on its chaos and glib fun. Durarara, on the other hand, chose a plodding pace and complete lack of chaos, which would be perfectly fine on its own, but it tries to imitate Baccano's charm and sense of wildness, so a lot of Durararaends up feeling forced and entirely inauthentic.\\n\\n\r\nI found that the real root of my utter dislike for this series is rooted in the characters. Perhaps some of it comes from my dislike of slice of life stylings. For instance, the simpering \"romance\" maybe or maybe not developing between Mikado and Anri made me grimace every time it was a focal point, and the \"glib\" romance of Selty and Shinra is just as plodding and unbearable for me, mostly because Selty is such a pansy about it at all times. But it is not just that...I find Shinra inauthentic, I find Anri and Selty inauthentic, and Shizuo and all his IZAYAAAAAAAAing and swinging around street signs a shoddily inauthentic attempt at badassery. They are all just so tepidly crafted and their existences in the series so plodding that I cannot help but not want to see them at all.I would be more fine with this if the focal point were Masaomi and his buddies/Mikado and a steady explanation of the Dollars, with a plodding pace to match the scenic action, but instead they are shifting around constantly between scenes and characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe other root of my dislike is probably the scenic action. Again, I feel like plodding scenes randomly barged in on by the IZAYAAAAAing and the like is really disruptive and both waters down the plot. While the scenes are certainly coherent, they drag all the time, like any of the scenes between Selty and the doctor. Perhaps some incredible part of the story or some incredible action will happen later on, but as of episode 11 ending with an awful Selty action scene (horrible whining by her, horrible action), a lot more scenes in this anime have bothered me than have thrilled me!\\n\\n\r\nEven without the character problems, I do not really feel the whole vibe of \"a city made of jokes, whims, and coincidences.\" Everything moves at such a plodding pace with predictable, tepid action that everything is very explicitly planned. You never feel surprised by anything at any time. I get the feeling that this might be a loss from the novel to the anime, but that is just a guess.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound varies between interesting and awful, but only Selty's voice acting particularly bothered me as far as that goes. The art varies between average modern anime and average modern anime, so nothing really exciting nor bad there. The story is entertaining enough when not getting in the way of itself, like with the overuse of computer gossiping to actually propel the plot, rather than just show how excited everyone is about the events of the super awesome city.\\n\\n\r\nI do not expect you many people to agree with me about my take, and that is fine. I had a long discussion with mostly one person, and there was enough for me to turn into this review, so I decided to go ahead and make it. I do apologize for making this a bit too much about Durarara versus Baccano, but I felt that it had to be part of the discussion.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that certain part of episode 11 that everyone is \"excited\" about is just disgusting fanservice (the clothing standing out was a really nice touch, but that was about all that I liked there). Again, surprisingly inauthentic following up a series so authentic like Baccano.",

            "content": "Okay, so after surrounding all the hype that encased this show, and because Crispin Freeman made a big deal about it at NYAF 2010, I decided to give it a shot. Half of me feels like it was a waste of time, and the rest of me isn't so sure. I am almost finished with it at this point, but I feel that writing the review now might be best (the end that is in sight isn't looking good.)\r\nNow, if you're one of the people looking to watch this show because you enjoyed Baccano! (I mean, who didn't?), then this is NOT for you. Itwill rub you all sorts of the wrong way. If you are someone that enjoys psychological thrillers with violence and mythology, step right up! However, I warn you now that it is a LOT to keep track of and isn't an overdose of any one genre specifically (except the sick pervy romance kind.) \\n\\n\r\nLet's begin with the STORY, which I gave a 6. I pondered over this one for a little because it's actually a lot of stories all jammed in together, and individually they are all pretty boring, but together it makes for an interesting mix. In Baccano, which I highly recommend, you have three or less stories to keep track of at any one time; in Durarara, you have ... I dunno... a lot? A lot. You've got headless horsemen, sick doctors, unloved high school girls, a psychotic informant, some guy that throws vending machines, high school kids that lead huge street gangs, and some manga-obsessed quad-team that doesn't seem to matter but takes up screen time to confuse you. And yes, all of these things are stories that all interlace and run headlong into each other, until you don't know which was is up or down, and if you wanted it to be either of them! \\n\\n\r\nGranted, people throwing vending machines is REALLY cool, so Crispin Freeman can have his kudos for being one of the few awesome characters. But I mean. If you're just gonna watch it for Shizzy-chan, then just watch episode 7, which is his backstory, and be done with it. \\n\\n\r\nI just have a sinking feeling that this is the kind of anime that won't ever be resolved in a satisfying way. Why do I say that? Well, at the point where you find the epicenter of ONE of the plot lines, and two characters meet head to head (figuratively speaking, since one of them is headless), there is the feeling that the source of all the pain should be taken and everything can be resolved and we can move forward. What happens? One of the characters says 'Nice job killing everyone. Bye.' \\n\\n\r\nSeriously?\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the art (which got an 8 in my book). Well. It's very stylized, and I particularly love the grayed out background people, because it helps you keep track of who is not important. Until of course, everyone gets colored in as a huge 'EVERYONE IS IMPORTANT' statement. Hello Captain Obvious! I won't deny that the animation is fairly well done and the background work is phenomenal. Very rarely do they reuse any of the footage. We see the inside of one man's office maybe 20+ times, and only 3-5 of those times is it the same art. I really appreciate them not half-assing it artways, but it doesn't necessarily make up for the shitty incoherent plot they tried to concoct. \\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, I'm extremely picky. If I don't notice it, it sucked. My favorite sound track is from Eureka Seven, but I can honestly say DRRR comes pretty close! It is not very often that I actually LIKE the OP and ED songs from a show these days. It is even rarer that animators use music correctly! However, they have a refrain that they play several times when everyone should be rainbows and butterflies, and I love it! Absolutely love it! So the sound got a 9! \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were... mediocre at best. They were all very stereotypical, and nothing was TOO surprising. Watching them develop hasn't been the most interesting thing in the world, in fact it sometimes seems irrelevant despite the fact that the whole thing slowly seems to be turning into a slasher soap opera. As I said for the 'story' section, it is more about the characters than anything else, and so their histories ARE, essentially, the story. But you know, innocent high schoolers being majorly important gang leader/murderer/opposing gang leader... that's really original. I totally didn't see that coming in Higurashi when all the girls took out butcher knives and killed everyone. Come. On! \\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy all the character DESIGNS. Especially Shizuo and his bartender outfit, and Selty with her shadow-leather biker suit. So I didn't score it TOO badly. I just wish... all the characters had been less typical. In Baccano, all the characters kept me guessing; I couldn't tell bad from good and I loved every second of it! (Jacuzzi was the most surprising!) But man... like I didn't know Celty was gonna turn into a pile of mush around her captor (Stockholm Syndrome much?) Shinra? Everyone can see it coming, so it's not a spoiler. If you didn't, this anime is too dense for you, you need some light hearted shojo. (May I recommend Kaicho wa Maid-sama?) \\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, I gave it a 6. I'm still watching it aren't I? Could be I'm cooped up in the house for winter break like any anime fan, but it also could be that it has a mildly captivating watch value. I would recommend a rewatch, but only because it's so damn confusing. I feel like I should make a chart or something; in fact... I almost did. But how silly is that? If you have to watch anime with a chart, then it's too fucking complicated. Even Spice and Wolf, which people complain has a LOT of dialogue, isn't that complicated (AND IT INVOLVEES MATH PEOPLE.)\\n\\n\r\nSo anyway, I gave DRRR a 6. And I wanted to be able to provide a comprehensive reason as to why I'm scoring so low, so as to provide a new and fresh look on things. I hope it helped!",

            "content": "The anime has a series of tags and I would add 'psychological' to better describe some scenes. The story immediately caughts your attention by the way it's told, not by the content itself. Narita, the original creator and the rest of the team, in this regard used some cool classic tricks seen on many \"best seller\" books. Not only that, but overall the 'sound guys' managed to capture every scene with the right OST, making this an anime very easy to marathon.\r\nMonologues? Check. \r\nIts quality can vary, sometimes it feels brilliant, by giving insight to what the characters are thinking or to give a betterunderstanding of them. The problem lies in the action, sometimes it's just missing by plot constraints, which gives the (now and then) long monologues an important task. They must keep the viewer hooked. Doesn't always work, as not every single line of dialogue is great. So be aware,  you can have the feeling it's just there to fill blank spaces (maybe to reach those 24 eps mark).\\n\\n\r\nReverse chronology? Check.\\n\\n\r\nAn old trick but reliable. Many times the episodes starts showing the third act (final scene; climax), then going back to the first act (the setup act). This arouses the viewers attention, as you now are hooked to watch until you can comprehend that final scene. \\n\r\nSome times, to exploit and empathize some important moment in the overall comprehension of the story, the first act (setup) is also traded with the second (development) and vice-versa.\\n\\n\r\nI'll describe the feeling as seeing a Houdini's trick. Admiration and confusion will be felt at the beginning, then you'll slowly understand what you're watching as the trick is revealed.\\n\\n\r\nNarrative? Check.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a considerable number of characters. Not all have the same importance to the story, but there's at least one ep, where we will be presented with a certain point of view, where their opinion will be given on whatever is going on. It's not perfect as sometimes you can feel a little bittersweat about some of them, especially in the second half of the plot. It's there where you'll notice some flaws in some characters design.\\n\\n\r\nOST? Check.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is what I would call the perfect 'accompanist'. It's just a series of spot on instrumental beats that follows the visual and the plot, and that's it. Don't expect epic tracks to be played, a beautiful voice singing as an epic kick throws someone of. The show already has a lot going on, intricate ways of story telling, different characters (points of view) are shown all the time, lots of suspense, etc. Having those kinds of songs would just get in the way and divert your attention from the suspense. In this regard, I'll consider this anime OST not perfect or a masterpiece but the best 'accompanist' I've seen, as it just sets the right mood. \\n\\n\r\nI'll not mention openings and edings, as that to me is only relevant if used in the actual scenes, not just at start and end. \\n\\n\r\nSome quick regards for the animation. It's well made and executed well; not overwhelming, but it also doesn't go unnoticed. Kuddos for some details, like making the spectators who not intervene in the course of action/ or are not important to the plot go grey! Barely any visible mistakes in the animation.\\n\\n\r\nIs it perfect? No. I already hinted that it's not a masterpiece, especially at the beginning: \"caughts your attention by the way it's told, not by the content itself\". I'll not compare this show to Bacanno like most do, because I want to focus in one important story aspect, so forgive the next comparison. Anime like Shinsekai Yori or Shingeki no Kyojin have one thing in common, whether you agree it's well executed or not... Both start of with a very compelling plot or story that immediately hooks you. This show doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's Durarara then? It's your normal setting/plot that can get interesting because of the way it's told. Despite all the gimmicks I said previously, it doesn't change that fact! The team who worked on Durarara never had a compelling story, so they had to use every trick they could to make it stand out. I have no doubt, if it wasn't for them, Durarara would not be as good as it was, it would fall to average or fine. \\n\\n\r\nVideo: BD 720p\\n\r\nAudio: FLAC\\n\r\nMethod : marathon 24eps\\n\r\nOverall evaluation: 7.8",

            "content": "In the recent years, Ryohgo Naritan has become one of the most influential Japanese Light Novelist for his works, Baccano! and Durarara! which has gotten a lot of popularity on the market and have been enjoyed by a lot of persons. As a result of its popularity, the light novel got an anime adaptation on 2010 and on 2015 we will enjoy again the adventures of the people of Ikebukuro, with the second season of this fantastic franchise.\r\nMikado Ry\u016bgamine gets an invitation of one of his childhood friends and his best friend from elementary school Masaomi Kida for attending with him to the Raira Academy,on Ikebukuro, Tokio. As soon as he arrives to the district, while they are walking on  the streets of Ikebukuro, Masomi shows him how the city looks like and warns him about the rules of the city, including a bunch of groups and bands which impose distrust on the population of Ikebukuro, such as The Dollars, one of the most famous organization on the city.\\n\\n\r\nAlso Masaomi talks about their peculiar characters, including the informatory Izaya who is an \u201chuman lover\u201d, the violent Shizuo who \u201chates violence\u201d and The legend of Black Rider among others, the last one is one of the most peculiar characters who highlight Masaomi because all over the city people talk about a mysterious biker who is driving all over the city on his motorbike, which have created a lot of rumors on the city, considering it as a ghost with no head which uses the helmet for hiding its appearance. It is even considered a \u201cjustice symbol\u201d, on the city.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all these revelations, Mikado should deal with all the discoverings that he has just noticed and with the idea of beginning a new life in the big city after spending all his whole  life in his hometown, with a new school, new classmates, in a conflictive climate which is breathing on the city. After his first day, Mikado starts in his new school and both Masaomi and Mikado will meet Sonohara Anri and here is when the story starts.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are acquainted with Naritan\u00b4s style, you should know what the direction of the plot is. Basically it uses a peculiar style with a lot of independent stories  called also sub-stories, which at first seems not to be on relation, but at the end they started to link up. All the characters have something to contribute to the plot; you shouldn\u2019t forget it when you are watching this. One of the most important points to relate all the characters are in fact, the three children.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, is one of the most strong points of this series. Durarara have several of the best characters that you will find on an anime (This is demonstrated as well). This is one of the things that you will discover when you watch the first episode just with the behavior of the characters, although actually you could see them truly on action between the second and third episode. It is rare not to identify yourself and empathize with the characters after that. Although at first the three boys don't seem to be so interesting if you compare them with the rest of the characters, don\u00b4t give up them, they have a extraordinary character development and it is worth to follow their evolution. Also during of every episode, you will see stranger conversation on a chat in the computer. The identity of these characters won't be revealed, but you should keep your attention on this peculiar conversation, which are actually important for developing the plot.\\n\\n\r\nA part of the main characters, the supporting characters are also so important, including Shinra Kishitani , the underground doctor and probably considered as part of the main cast , Semyon Brezhnev who is helping one of his friends on a sushi shop, Seiji Yagiri who is looking for his \u201clove \u201cand much more. In general the characters from this series are extraordinarily good.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very good as well. Durarara have a very good soundtrack. The opening themes Uragiri no Yuuyake and Complication and the ending themes Trust Me and Butterfly are fantastic and probably you will hear several times when you are watching Durarara.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, in case you are taking this anime series after hearing about the announcement of the second season, you are a fan of Baccano or even if it is your first time with this franchise , my recommendation is: Give an opportunity of this anime series, it is very worth watching and you won't regret starting to watch this.\\n",

            "content": "This review is meant for the viewer who has already watched Baccano!, and who is contemplating watching Durarara!!. In the event that you\u2019ve not watched Baccano!, I suggest you watch it first. After all, the two anime boast the same director, and (either consequently or not) are generally similar in the way the story unfolds, and to lesser extent, how the characters are developed and how the plot reaches full circle, AND the point is that Durarara!! is, in my opinion, a much inferior work (perhaps as a result, or not, of) being really meant for the younger at heart.\r\nSo, fellow Baccano fan, let mejust say that I have never seen so many self-absorbed main characters in all my years of watching anime. And that sort of sums up this anime. Durarara!! (\"DRRR\") is basically a \"self-absorbed\" anime. \\n\\n\r\nShall I explain? Well, we are given lots on our viewer's plate, in the form of self-absorbed musings in this show: the multitude of one-dimensional side characters, the obligatory side-stories to explain the seemingly random existence of the side characters, the self-absorbed and trivial thoughts of the three main teenage characters, etc. The director obviously expects viewers to dig everything about the anime without a thought of whether each above-mentioned element is as good as the aggregate of them. But let's get something straight, Mr Director. Baccano! had some of these elements, yes, but it was fantastically done, as the whole work was simply built upon its excellent parts. DRRR, however, is not a Baccano.\\n\\n\r\nNow perhaps the fact that the main characters in DRRR are teenagers has something to do with it. My thoughts are that DRRR might be perfect for you if you're around the age of 15-16, for the musings of the main teenage characters (and sad to say, for some of the adults as well) are of a maturity barely above that age. Some five minutes can go by with you, the viewer, subject to the vacuous rambling of the lead characters. If you're well over 20 yrs old like me, chances are, you would do well to give this anime a miss. Or else, when you reach say, episodes 20-22, you'll have all the angst, confusion and sheer immaturity that will send you stark raving mad.\\n\\n\r\nBut that is not to say that this anime is mediocre or a utter waste of time. Granted, DRRR is not a Baccano, even if there are throwaway references to the latter throughout the former. But still, Baccano fans can expect a fairly interesting plot at times, and one or two memorable characters (Celty is one of them). However, the magic of Baccano in its plot twists, developments and final resolution are sorely missed in DRRR. As I said, I have the feeling that DRRR is catered to a younger age group than Baccano was.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself not easily attracted to the myriad of characters in DRRR, and I blame it on their character development. All the characters are simply too one-sided. After you're introduced to each character, and you see them in subsequent episodes, you unfortunately realize that that's exactly how they're like and will act throughout the show. And that is something a good anime normally tries to avoid. The fact is that, in DRRR, knowing exactly how a character will act spoils quite a lot of the enjoyment factor, especially when the character has his on-screen \"emo\" or self-absorbed times, and when this mental state of his or her spans more than a few episodes. When will the dragging about end? It's a real wet blanket for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to go on about the other critiques or the few thumbs-up that I have (god knows I'm willing), simply because that's not my intention, though. I just wanted to put out a humble warning to anyone who might view DRRR's high rating on MAL or the various praises sung of it as an indication of its suitability to everyone. \\n\\n\r\nSo that said, if you're interested in going behind the minds of the three main characters in this anime, all of whom are plainly immature, fairly ignorant and subject to teenage angst and hormonal changes, by all means give DRRR a try. \\n\\n\r\nIf you're not interested in the above, and you want to maintain your good impression of Baccano's director, give DRRR a miss. \\n\\n\r\nCheers.",

            "content": "Durarara!! can best be described as an attempt to improve upon its earlier, sister series, Baccano! Both are based off of the original works of Narita Ryohgo, and directed by Omori Takahiro. I thoroughly enjoyed Baccano and as such,  looked forward to watching another similar work utilizing the same story-telling method that made the previous series so refreshing to watch. To say that Durarara was not enjoyable would be a lie. While it retained a lot of the characteristics that made Baccano so great, there remained some items that left a lot to be desired. \r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSTORY (7) : Let me preface this first bysaying, if you haven't watched Baccano yet, WATCH IT FIRST! If you're a sucker for cross-references or cameo appearances, your experience of Durarara will be that much better if you do (at least for me it did). \\n\\n\r\nThe story is fairly unique. It is told using a fragmented story-telling structure that utilizes different character perspectives to tell an overarching tale of the Ikebukuro underworld. This is a wonderful way to immerse viewers into the world, if done right. In my opinion, Brains Base kinda missed the mark on this one. There are several reasons for this:\\n\\n\r\n         1) There are too many 'fragments' that need to be pieced together. Baccano was successful because although there were numerous fragments, the 13 episode nature of the series meant that most of the 'wtf is happening'  moments are quickly solved. Not to mention that there are always re-cuts that show you how the pieces exactly fit together, so you're never in the dark for too long. In Durarara's 24 episode case, I often found myself forgetting why something was happening not only because these fragments were too intertwined with other fragments, but because the resolutions to these fragments were so far apart from each other, despite the presence of several (less frequent) re-cuts to help re-orient viewers. An element in episode 8 may not be fully fleshed out until 6 or 7 episodes later, where I would often find myself asking, \"how did this come about again?\".\\n\\n\r\n2) Solutions to conflicts are solved by -insert the omnipotent and omniscient Orihara plot device-. It was just a bit too convenient for my liking. Instead of having the story fragments come together independently and making the viewer go, \"OH SHIT, SO THAT'S HOW IT WENT DOWN?\", each arc/conflict was solved by a simple explanation (mostly Orihara) claiming that they caused X problem and knew that X person would do this. \\n\\n\r\nDespite these issues, when you really wrap your head around how many characters were incorporated into the story and the unique blend of gangsters, supernatural occurrences, and folk-tales, its really hard not to give Brains Base an A for effort. I still thoroughly enjoyed many parts but not as much as I wanted to.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nART (8) : Solid animation. Characters are consistent and the movement is smooth. Attention to detail is great. One peeve that I have though, are the cop-outs on the extras. I know it's hard to design hundreds of unimportant characters, but at least give them colour or something ): It's not game-breaking though, since everything else was very well-done.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nSOUND (8): Love the OPs and EDs. The first OP is just super memorable with that catchy drumline. OST was good, could stand for a BIT more variety. Some memorable tracks, most were just average. VA was well-done, no complaints in this department either, all-star lineup.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (6): Okay, it gets kinda ugly here. I found it extremely hard to grow attached to any of the main characters because for the most part, they're extremely pedestrian. The only characters that I invested myself in were (isn't it obvious?) Celty and Shizuo, mostly because their personalities and unique traits set themselves apart from the rest of the cast. Let's focus of the main triangle of Anri, Mikado and Masaomi for now:\\n\\n\r\nThe main focus of the story is based around the struggles of these three teenagers and the battles against their own personal demons and how it adversely affected their relationships with each other. Although Anri and Masaomi's backgrounds were fleshed out, I still can't wrap my head around Mikado's. To put it simply, he started off as a pushover, and concluded the story as a pushover, but not as much as he was before. For the duration of the series, Mikado demonstrates that he's powerless to do anything and rarely showed the initiative to change himself as opposed to Anri and Masaomi. Without any spoilers, the climax of the series involves a potential standoff between these three characters, and the resolution to it was rather...lackluster. It was extremely cliche and straightforward. Definitely leaves you craving for a more refined conflict at the end.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the story would have fared much better had it focused on what I thought, was an extremely intriguing character. I would of much rather have a series completely focused around Celty's quest for her missing head and the evolution of her struggles between her current self, and the self that she wants to be. Not to mention that Celty's problems were never really resolved at the end of the series, which brings me to my last issue with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story introduces multiple characters, and aside from a quick background blurb about their motives, many of them are left to their own, many of which just disappear after a single appearance (ie. Kasuka's father). For example: Saki, the Yagiri siblings and the 'dotachin band of travellers' are present in various scenes with enough background given to make you think that they're bigger players in the story, they really don't do anything. They're all very lukewarm characters. I hate to keep bringing up Baccano, but I can remember at least 75% of the names from that anime and they were all excellently portrayed and had unique personalities. Aside from Celty and the badass Shizuo, I can't really say I remember any more than that.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nOVERALL ENJOYMENT (7) : There's a lot to like about this anime, even though my review may not reflect as such. Ultimately, Durarara took a step back from what was a superior anime in Baccano, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. When you try to implement a similar structure into a completely new setting with a more diverse cast of characters and storylines, it becomes a lot harder to duplicate your success. Even though it may be a step down in completeness, it still stands a step above other series in sheer scale of the story, which must be acknowledged. Durarara is an enjoyable watch, especially if you're a fan of mystery and drama. With three additional seasons recently announced to be in the works, we can expect some of the questions that remained at the end of this series to be answered in the near future.\\n",

            "content": "Durarara!! or as I like to call it for fun DRRR!! is an interesting anime series. Putting a lot of emphasis into creating its characters and world were losing tons of time becomes a habit when watching the series. Capturing the chaos and mystery of the city in it\u2019s version of Ikebukuro with soaring success. While the story being told is decent as a whole what makes it memorable and a great way to spend time are the characters themselves. No matter what flaws present themselves, the characters always manage to make it seem like those flaws don\u2019t matter in the long run.\r\nMixed: Interesting storyfilled with questionable decisions\\n\\n\r\nDurarara!! has a headless horseman, a girl with a demon sword that can possess people, a puppet master bent on creating chaos, gang leaders wanting gang warfare, and a person with superhuman strengths among its cast. You would think one of those characters would be the protagonist. Except that position is given to an average teen, Mikado Ryugamine, whose relevance and backstory is not given until episode eleven. Giving the other characters more than enough time to overshadow him. Despite that specific pitfall the story manages to fit in elements of teen drama without feeling inappropriate with everything else in the story. The focus on presenting Ikebukuro and Japanese youth culture through internet chat rooms, text messages, and technology in general lends itself to making the city more lively. Seeing characters talk about rumors, folklore, and their experiences make it feel like a real chaotic city. While Mikado is a weak point of interest compared to the other characters, him being in the central of the story makes sense. He is experiencing life in Ikebukuro for the first time interacting with a host of interesting characters and sometimes unknowingly being part of a bigger ordeal beyond his control. What also justifies Mikado as the lead is he\u2019s experiencing and learning everything about Durarara!! version of Ikebukuro just like the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nIn every episode the narrative will rotate onto a different focused character. Shining the spotlight on the cast members when the opportunity presents itself. After the primary introduction in episode one the rest of series spends time exploring it cast. In a semi-non linear fashion it spends times on various characters each having their own conflict in a single episode like finding a kidnap friend for a single episode or looking for a missing head for the entire series. Eventually having the large cast interact with each other in various ways and form an engrossing narrative with a mystery at its heart. In the first half, the main draw is a mystery centering around the headless rider. The headless rider search of her head spans several decades trusting the viewing to piece together the information themselves. This headless rider storyline takes some unexpected directions that will keep viewers guessing on where it\u2019ll go next.\\n\\n\r\nIt's biggest strength is in telling a series of smaller stories weaving them together into a larger story. All the events shown correlate with one another in some way expertly building up to a climax. Without action, it build up is very exciting, thanks in large to wanting to see how it\u2019ll played out once all the elements are together. The smartest choice the series made regarding its writing was being more serious than splitting half of tone balancing comedy. While it filled with fun personalities to lighten up from the darker aspects of the anime. When it times to take something seriously there\u2019s no need to worry about transitioning between tones. Handling it expertly by having jokes every now and then, but by not at making it an equal focus like its drama.\\n\\n\r\nFor an anime that has a cool cast of characters how it uses them is disappointing. At times dropping characters completely from the series, though even those characters manage to have a good moment. The only time this is ever a consistent problem is with police officer Kinnosuke Kuzuhara in the second half. He\u2019s featured in the second opening of the anime misleading viewers he has a decent size role in the second half. The fact he doesn\u2019t do much or receive much characterization is made more noticeable because of it. \\n\\n\r\nFrom episode thirteen and onwards it builds up is allot more rewarding than the actual resolution to the storylines. The second half of Durarara!! spends lots of time jumping back and forth between timelines where it becomes unnecessary. A linear narrative framing device would have better suited the second half. It\u2019s constantly jumping back to earlier episodes that instead of moving the story forward take steps backwards. Halting progress in certain episodes as literally nothing has happened to progress forward. The reason it does this is because the series is bad at foreshadowing. With the exception of Masaomi Kida past, revelations on characters come out of left fields. For example, there\u2019s a large gang called the Dollars in that no one within it knows who started the gang. Once it gets revealed who started the gang it\u2019s seem to be there to justified following a character for long as it has. It also is a disservice to the character when he\u2019s given a just because motivation of sorts.\\n\\n\r\nAnother drawback in the second half is the mystery aspect is gone when the focus is put on the three leads. What exactly is keeping Mikado, Anri, and Masaomi separated is shown to the audience as a series of misunderstanding and indecisiveness. Also, laziness on the writer part for not having the characters talk to each other because of if they did the whole ordeal would have been dealt with quickly. Having them act on assumptions throughout the second half. Compare to earlier storylines, one of which deals with a character looking for her head. Misunderstandings as a source of conflict is less interesting in comparison and executed badly when the audience is show the source before the characters discover it. Making the halt in progress more obvious when waiting patiently for it to move forward.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of the series doesn\u2019t feel conclusive leaving dangling plot threads and fate of certain characters left in the open. In no way is the ending sequel bait as some character arcs (Celty arc being the best example) have satisfying growth by the end of the series. Where it feels inconclusive are with the lead characters. Just when the viewers learn about their past there\u2019s a desire to see how the three will interact with one another once those kept secrets are revealed to everyone. Instead of showing that it simply tidy everything up as if the secrets the lead characters kept from each other wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. It\u2019s a thrilling ride that ends with a whimper instead of a bang.\\n\\n\r\nGood: A layered cast\\n\\n\r\nThe story might have a weaker second half, but the cast of characters are able to escape the same pitfall of the story. For starter, not all characters presented will have a major role or even a recurring minor role in the long run. This is made up with the writing that manages to weave together an unlikely cast of character with all sorts of different background together to compliment each other nicely. There are personalities of all types of the love-to-hate jerk Izaya Orihara, the short fuse bartender Shizuo Heiwajima, passionate Otaku Walker and Erika, and many more. \\n\\n\r\nThe three leads are high school students and for the duration of the first half they are overshadowed by the supporting cast. Mikado Ryugamine is the new kid with average characteristics, Masaomi Kida the best friend with a hidden past, and Anri Sonohara the bespectacled timid girl. They receive partial characterization in the series that make them good character. When the series finally goes into their past, they become more interesting than how they presented at first sight. In Durarara!! there\u2019s always allot more to the characters than what we initially know. This partial development does backfire when they are the focus in the second half and due lazy writing it creates a force conflict between them. These characters are compelling, but how their story was told brings down what could have been another good arc.\\n\\n\r\nCelty Sturluson, the Headless Rider, is a stand out in the large cast. She goes to Japan in search of her head communicating with the locals through a PDA. Throughout the series she lives with scientist Shinra Kishitani whom she shares an interesting relationship with. It develops into something romantic that, crazy as it sound, but actually sweet in execution. Both characters are playful together as well as being show being able to talk through any issue like a real couple. Whenever Celty and Shinra are on screen the writing is at it's best. \\n\\n\r\nAnother memorable character is Shizuo Heiwajima. The shortfuse bartender with superhuman strength who hates to fight. His characteristic are a bit ironic since he does fight allot in the series leading being in the center of the most over the top moments in the anime. Usually tossing around any large object connected to the ground like a streetlight or vending machines like it weighs nothing. He has a rivalry with Izaya Orihara who's also another memorable character. Leading to the two clashing heads with Shizuo using his fists and Izaya using his head in their confrontations. This leads to more great moments. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a group of four friends who are always together consisting of Kyohei, Walker, Erika, and Kyohei. Kyohei is the leader of the group, especially after all four quitting the Blue Squares. Walker and Erika are passionate Otaku and manga reader and if you\u2019ve a large chunk of anime you will know the references all which aren\u2019t subtle. Like in the second opening one of the manga that\u2019s shown in their collection is Sword Art Online, there\u2019s also a poster for the short film Cencoroll hanging outside the theater, or two characters from Baccano making cameos which are only a few references. Lastly there is Saburo, who is the driver of the group and gets mad whenever his van is wrecked. The chemistry between these characters is gold acting like actual friends acting like goofballs even in serious situations.\\n\\n\r\nGood: A catchy soundtrack and a voice cast to die for make up for inconsistent animation\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is done by studio Brain\u2019s Base and it\u2019s decent. Coloring in several episodes will have large crowds of people just painted gray or black and white. This makes no sense from a production standpoint given the insane amount of time it must have taken to create Ikebukuro. The backgrounds have to take into account all the effect for neon street signs, lighting of the city at night or day time, the different material of buildings, streets have to seemingly connect to one another, and other tiny details to sell the idea of its being a living, breathing city. With that much hard work put into connecting all the backgrounds to make Ikebukuro come to life, leaving background characters gray comes across as laziness. Whenever it does anything over the top it delivers those moments spectacularly. Though, in motion some character movements (like the first fight between Izaya facial expressions when he first fights Shizuo) will have some unintentionally hilarious awkward facial expressions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters design varies; if it\u2019s an important character they are stylized though not memorable. If they are part of the background than details are spared like fully coloring them to missing some line detail on limbs. Some animation in the second half will take a noticeable dip in quality when they matter the most. In episode 17 titled \u201cEverything Changes\u201d, Shizuo fights a large crowd of people scraping some details like not coloring the large crowds, or rawing a giant blob instead of individuals' bodies for a crowd. In general Durarara!! has this recurring problem with background characters lacking the same details as important character sparing details through its run. At first it comes across a neat stylistic choice and later feels like laziness. \\n\\n\r\nDirector Takahiro Omori makes handling a large cast seem natural. Despite some characters being under utilized Omori direction makes sure it\u2019s never overwhelming to keep track off. While the story being told isn\u2019t linear what events unfold in the episodes are. Omori uses a character to transit into another character to show their perspective in that specific moment or episode. No matter who he rotates the attention to he manages to have far greater success than failures in his direction. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless what format you hear the audio in both cast offer a great list of voice actors. The Japanese voice cast offers Miyano Mamoru, Jun Fukuya, Miyuki Sawashiro, Hiroshi Kamiya, Daisuke Ono, Yuichi Nakamura, and the list goes on. This same rule applies to the English dub, which was produced by Bang Zoom! Entertainment and they basically gathered some of the most recognizable voice actors in anime dubbing. The English dub has a dream cast come true for anyone who watches English dubs regularly. It has the likes of Johnny Bosch Yong, Michelle Ruff, Bryce Papenbrook, Kari Wahlgren, Yuri Lowenthal, Crispin Freeman, Steve Blum, and Patrick Seitz to name a few. Quite a cast, regardless what version is heard.\\n\\n\r\nBoth cast have a similar issue of giving talented voice actors little material in the anime. Almost as if just gathering them up for name recognition. In the English dub, Stephanie Sheh plays Rio Kamichika who in only one episode has an important role. Her character fades away quickly after episode two. Another awesome voice actor who gets limited screen time is David Vincent who plays Seji Yagari. His performance is fine, but not varied in how to portray the character. Always having to sound concerned about his girlfriend. Cassandra Lee Morris, who plays Saki Mikajima gets to speak in very little in the anime. In the Japanese cast Keiju Fujiwara, Hochu Ostuka, Toru Okawa, Yuji Ueda, and you get the point. \\n\\n\r\nThe weakest link in the English dub is Darrel Guilbeau as Mikado Ryugamine. His performance is uneven and for a leading role. He easily gets overshadowed by his cast members whom deliver better performances. Darrel Guilbeau performance will take time to get used to before sounding natural in it. Toshiyuki Toyonaga who provides the Japanese voice for Mikado Ryugamine is good from the first episode. Bringing personality into an average character without sounding wooden in his portrayal of the everyguy lead. It\u2019s a good performance that unlike Guilbeau, does not get overshadowed by his co-stars. \\n\\n\r\nKari Wahlgren has more line to deliver than Miyuki Sawashiro in the role of Celty. The way Celty talks to another character is through text on her PDA. Depending how and where you see the anime English subtitles might not appear (even on DVDs this happens) when Japanese text is displayed. This is remedied in the English dub by Kari Wahlgren reading those lines of Japanese text on her phone to the audience, though it will feel like something is missing without knowing that bit of information. Miyuki Sawashiro does equally well in portraying Celty giving her a mysterious aloof charm, warmth, and sisterly undercurrents of her character.\\n\\n\r\nBryce Papenbrook for the English dub and Mamoru Miyano in the Japanese cast both play Masaomi Kida. Aside from a couple word changes for Papenbrook dialogue (like saying boobilicous) both actors have unfettered energy and enthusiasm down. When it comes to performing the more dramatic scenes Miyano delivery is superior, though Papenbrook is not bad either.His comedic delivery is better than his dramatic voice work. Kana Kanzawa and Michelle Ruff, both play Anri with a timid low voice. Both actresses play the character similarly which, unlike the rest of the cast is difficult to pinpoint strengths and weaknesses. They both do a good job in the role. Crispin Freeman and Daisuke Ono both play Shizuo Heiwajima. Freeman goes more for a perpetually rougher, grittier feel, in his portrayal contrasting Daisuke Ono's is suave calmness into maniacal madman transitions is entertaining. Both performances portray the character differently, but both interpretations fit the character. \\n\\n\r\nJohnny Yong Bosch and Hiroshi Kamiya play Izaya Orihara. Johnny Yong Bosch performance of Izaya is the definitive portrayal of Izaya. Hiroshi Kamiya is fine in the role, but Johnny Yong Bosch excessive smugness and hammy voice work serve Izaya far better. Unlike Kamiya, Johnny Yong Bosch is able to come across as a comical menace who can make you laugh and take him as a serious threat. Yuri Lowenthal and Jun Fukuyama both played Shinra Kishitani. Lowenthal performance is subtle and compose. It\u2019s an unexpected performance with the contrast Fukuyama goes for the mad scientist route in his portrayal. Fukuyama performance is very fun in the over the top nature he acts, though Lowenthal comes across as a more likable Shinra because when he says something romantic towards Celty it sounds romantic instead of sounding insane. \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s no wrong way to see Durarara!! since both English sub and English dub deliver the material in virtually the same way. Just a minor word or phrase changes to sound natural in their respective languages. However, the Japanese cast just barely etches out a victory as the superior audio track thanks to Toshiyuki Toyonaga in the leading role as Mikado Ryugamine. Darrel Guilbeau takes time to improve his performance before sounding natural in the role and taking a lot longer to become accustomed to hearing in a cast filled with great voice actors. Toshiyuki Toyonaga is strong from the beginning standing on his own. He provides Mikado a personality adding to the everyguy trait of Mikado. Unlike Darrel Guilbeau who starts out bland, Toshiyuki Toyonaga gets it right from episode one and is a smoother viewing experience. Whatever your preferences for viewing anime is both cast are good.\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening theme song, \u201cUragai no Yuuyake\u201d (Sunset of Betrayal in English) by Theatre Brook is used in episode 1 - 12 is forgettable. It\u2019s fit fine with the opening animation with light rock beats, though it\u2019s nowhere near as memorable as it closing theme. Once the catchy R&B song with J-Pop lyrics, \u201cTrust Me\u201d, by Yuya Matsushita start playing in the outro it\u2019ll be able to put anyone in good mood. The closing animation is a single image that\u2019s pan down with color altering effects to show all the characters. Simple as it might be the track and the closing animation are oddly memorable. The fact there\u2019s dozen of parodies of it first closing animation is a testament how memorable it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the anime has the opposite effect on the second opening (episode 13 - 24) and second closing tracks (episode 13 - 23). In the second half the opening track, \u201cComplication\u201d, by Rookiez is Punk\u2019d is a far more memorable track building up excitement before the anime starts. It\u2019s edgy sound combine with some vocals makes a good  rock song that\u2019s able to stand on its own even without having to see the anime. \u201cButterfly\u201d by On/Off is an okay track that\u2019s not as memorable as \u201cTrust Me\u201d by Yuya Matsushita. The most memorable thing about the track are it\u2019s guitar chords at the end of the track which closes off things nicely. It\u2019s unfortunately accompanied by an animated outro that tries to copy the closing animation of the first half, which is uncreative as it is forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST is composed by Makoto Yoshimori and it\u2019s a fine soundtrack. Heavy in Jazz music it perfectly captures the mood of Ikebukuro from it thuggery environment to its more mysterious side giving off a cool and mysterious vibe. Combining Jazz with piano and violin melodies, industrial instrumental, orchestral, folklore music, and even random noises. Like inserting laughter in the middle of the track \u201cIkebukuro nishiguchi go mata-ro kostaten\u201d. It\u2019s diverse in genre and risking in composition culminating in a unique soundtrack with plenty of music of all types to offer.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Despite a lackluster second half I had a good time\\n\\n\r\nIt started out weak with it first episode doing nothing, but introducing many characters. Leading to mix feelings to how it might turn out in the long run. Episode two got rid off any and all concerns I might have had with the series. Showing it true strengths in providing an engrossing world and fantastic character moments. Another bonus for me was recognizing the character designer of the Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor series, Suzuhito Yasuda, also did the character designs for the anime in my second viewing of the series. For me personally, that added it a bit more charm to the series in being able to see more of Yasuda creations. Granted the series wasn\u2019t smooth sailing for the entire run. Before reaching its final arc, it was starting to lose some steam which it never overcame. The ending did leave something to be desired on the story front by leaving dangling plot threads, but as a viewing experience I am completely satisfied. While the quality of the story takes a dip towards the end. The true draw of the series for me were the characters that kept me coming back episode after episode. No matter what character took focus I was more than happy to see the events unfold. Watching the series was enjoyable on so many level. Writing (and you possibly reading) this review, which turned out as long as it did not as fun. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/3\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/3\\n\\n\r\nProduction Values (animation, sound, etc.): 2/3\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 1/1\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nDurarara!! is an entertaining anime where the apparent flaws don\u2019t ever seem to matter when viewing the anime. It\u2019s so easy to get engrossed into the large cast of realize characters and the city of Ikebukuro that losing track of time becomes common in Durarara!!. In every area it has a strong point that stands out from the story that developed layered characters down to the memorable soundtrack that will be stuck in the viewer's head. It\u2019s an anime that creates a world successfully that you will want to revisit it time and time again to see a different side of what makes Ikebukuro so special.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nFrom its enigmatic characters, to its unhinged storyline, down to its eccentric name, Durarara!! is the definition of absurdity. Is that always a good thing? Certainly not. Is it a good thing in this case? Yes, it definitely is. This anime has everything you could ever want in a fast-paced, thrilling anime; epic plot twists, unique characters, and an exciting concept. Much like DRRR's spiritual predecessor, Baccano!, there is simply too much going on to give a good synopsis without spoilers. There are mythological figures, people with super-strength, gangsters, demonic possession, a seemingly omnipotent information broker waging psychological warfare, and much, much more.It's just downright insanity. Perfect? No. Fun? Yes.\\n\\n\r\nThe true allure of DRRR is that all of its ridiculousness is not revealed in separate story arcs, which is how essentially every other  anime chooses to tell more then one story; it is instead told all at the same time in one massive, confusing, wacky plot, and that's\u00a0what makes DRRR so unique. There is a lot to keep track of and there is no main focus of the plot; there is simply a collection of smaller stories all intertwined with one another in the unbelievably alive setting of Ikebukuro, Japan. This unique style of storytelling is very appealing and that is the reason I enjoyed the plot so much despite its minor flaws. DRRR simply stands out from the crowd. However, it is worth noting that the first season left quite a few loose ends that season 2 needs to tie up, but that's just another reason why I am extremely excited for it. I can not wait to see where the storyline goes from here, and that isn't a feeling that just any anime can give to you. Honestly, I have trouble imagining a scenario where season 2 can top the absurdity of the first season, but at the very least it can tie up the loose ends.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot is the most unique thing about DRRR, it is very much a character-driven show. It sports a huge cast (too many to go over), but most of them are very unique and well-written. My favorite thing about the characters in DRRR is that there is a lot more to all of them then you initially think. For instance; Mikado seems like a token, stereotypical male lead from the very start of the show (he's sort of the show's pseudo-protagonist for a while). However, it turns out there is a lot more to him that meets the eye, because he has a very shocking secret about him that changes his character completely, and he is not the only character with a shocking secret. The fan favorites, however, are definitely Izaya and Shizou, and rightfully so. Watching those two go at each other never gets old. I am firmly in the camp of Team Izaya thanks to his intoxicating personality and general badassery, but Shizou is pretty cool too. Unfortunately, shows that sport such a large cast of characters often have problems with character development, and DRRR is no major exception thus-far. There are too many characters to flesh out in the given amount of screen time and yet the show tries to treat every character equally, and what results is some significant issues with balance. This is forgivable though considering the show still has an entire 2nd season on the way, where it will have plenty of time to work on that. \\n\\n\r\nAs for aesthetics, they are slightly above average in my overall opinion. DRRR's animation is very fluent, but it's not that all that visually appealing if you ask me. The people in the background, for example, are not even colored in; they are left black and white (symbolism?). It doesn't really look good and the environments could really use a bit more detail. Great character designs though. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is great in nearly every way possible; the first opening is absolutely fantastic, as is the first ending. I'm not crazy about the second OP or the second ED, but the OST is solid as well (albeit a bit lacking in diversity). The voice acting is above average in both the sub and dub, so take your pick\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for something fun, unique, and just downright entertaining, I would highly recommend checking out Durarara!!. It's far from perfect, but I had a blast watching it. If you love plot twists, unique/lovable characters, and over-the-top fun, DRRR is the anime for you. I await the 2nd season with a lot of excitement.",

            "content": "Right from the very beginning, something about the title, or was it the caution tape artwork that grabbed my attention. It was bizarre to me at first, to be watching an anime that featured a different character in every episode but after I warmed up to it, this anime was undoubtedly enjoyable. It was entirely unique, and refreshing, and overall, an anime with brilliant potential, but left with loose ends.\r\nPros:\r\nDurarara features simply AMAZING artwork, something fans would go crazy about. The characters each had distinct personalities, some that even we as the viewers can relate to. Light-hearted at times and even sometimes comical, the creatorsdid a great job keeping tabs on all the characters. I watched attentively as each person filtered in, adding their own touch to this gang-oriented anime. Refreshing, cool, and overall a memorable anime.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nStory, Art, Soundtrack etc. were all avant-garde (as Shinra would say). However, the one thing that didn't quite satisfy me was the ending. Towards the later episodes, 22, 23, etc. I could feel the tension building up as each character's deepest secrets were revealed, one by one. Trust and friendship all hanging on the thinnest line. I was just waiting for that \"WOW\" moment that would blow me away leaving my mind to ponder the plot for days on end. But, i was greatly disappointed. I felt the anime concluded weakly, obviously the viewer could piece together all the facts, but I just didn't feel that there was a solid conclusion. Loose ends maybe?\\n\\n\r\nFor example: Izaya, although we all know he is Ikebukuro's mastermind, what was his ultimate motive? He claims he loves humans, but what of it? Didn't he do this all to awaken Celty's head? And what of Celty? She's a main character, obviously, but other than transporting messages and bringing one character to another, what did she really do? What was the point of having a Dullahan in the story? I felt that each character had so much potential, but in the end it just didn't blow me away.",

            "content": "As a quick introduction, I hope to write reviews to 'Inform' and to 'Educate' the mass on certain shows, whether it be deserving of more attention or overhyped, with tihs being one of the latter.\r\nDurarara can be described in one word; Disappointing. Why? With Durarara having been constantly compared to it's predecessor, and what I believe to be the superior, turned out to be disappointing and a cheap shot by Brains Base. With this in mind, I hope to address the merits and flaws of this show through compare and contrast with Baccano. \r\nStory- 3\r\nWhy have I given this a 3? The story was neither'Dreadful', or 'Pathetic', but is undeserving to be rated as Decent or anything better, because It could be summed up as a cheap and literal translation from Novel to Anime, with 0 creativity put in, which was a slap in the face for those who expected Brains Base to present us Durarara in the same or similar format on how they handled Baccano; Having small parts of different story arcs placed in an episode for us to piece together as the story progressed. The same can't be said about Durarara, which was a stark contrast to Baccano, being painful and slow, especially those who expected this to be as dynamic as it's predecessor. Furthermore, the only interesting 'part' of the series was perhaps its 2nd arc, which was short-lived and ignored by the finall arc, which was supposed to sum this whole series together. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 9\\n\r\nNot much can really be 'debated' in this area, as modern anime goes, the animation was smooth, the characters were consistent, and I had no quells with the design adaptations of the novel characters to anime, but it certainlhy isn't outstanding, which is why I believed 'Great' did justice in this criteria.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 8\\n\r\nThe same is said in regards to Sound, as there really is no 'debate' over one's preference to their likes and dislikes regarding the sound of an anime; The Openings and Endings were decent, the cast of Seiyus were accepable, and the BGM did not ruin the viewer's enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 2\\n\r\nWhy 2? Brains Base, was well... dreadful. I was not attached to a single of the characters in the whole series. Not one of what, 20+ characters? Not one of them appealed to me, and that to be honest is a shock. Their personalities ranged from the typical 1-dimensional pussy to the complete asshole. Really, 20+ characters were available to be molded and not one gave me any sort of attachment, and that is a shock. I watched the show hoping the pussy or the asshole would have even a marginal evolution in terms of their personality only to be mind-raped at the last episode, with the stark reality of life hammered into me that shit just doesn't change. And unlike Baccano, where comic relief is entertaining, the so called comic relief presented in this show is either horrifying or incredibly narcissistic.  One of the only few moments that I enjoyed was having one asshole be an asshole to another asshole, if that should have been redeeming.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 3\\n\r\nI expected this serie to give me the same dynamic pace that Baccano gave me, not the direct opposite. It was in general agonizing to go through Durarara only to realize that it's going to cop you out of all the hype you felt over this show. I expected the same, fast-pace story telling that Baccano had as an appeal only to bve shattered by the abysmal mess of Durarara. At first this was a show that me and my friends would be able to be look forward to, to watch together only to be shoved to a side as we realized that this was an absolute abomination. Durarara kills the element of sleuthing that Baccano gave us as we question what would happen next by having the explanation given the episode after the 'story'. I have this a 'poor' for the little moments I enjoyed this as a sort of moment of gathering, which failed miserably after around  the 12th episode.\\n\\n\r\nOveral- 3l\\n\\n\r\n sure, some would say it's got great visuals and sound, but it fails to deliver the  touch that I had expected from Baccano, turning this show into a slow, agonizing chore that I lived with in spite of far better shows at the time, and a waste of what could have been critically acclaimed like Baccano was. There will always be conflicting ideas from other (re)viewers as their tastes are unique, and their points are most probably valid in their own rights, but in honesty I cannot reccommend this show genuinely to those that hoped for show that would be on-par with Baccano or maybe better than Baccano, as this is, to be blunt, a piece of shit in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nRegards.",

            "content": "Narita manages to catch lightning in a bottle twice...sort of.\r\nOverview:\r\nDurarara is the spiritual successor to Baccano and takes place in the same universe. Once again, the famous light novelist Ryohgo Narita uses the formula of having TONS of zany characters that all somehow tie together. Also like in Baccano, the story is told non-sequentially and from multiple perspectives. The question you're probably asking is, \"If he was going to basically re-make Baccano, why not just continue Baccano where the first series left off?\" The answer to that question is marketing. Baccano took place in the US during the Prohibition Era and played around with Americancultural tropes and cliches. I believe the author stated that he created Baccano after binge watching The Godfather, Goodfellas, and The Untouchables back to back. If you asked Tarantino to direct a prohibition era Mafia movie, it WOULD be Baccano. Although it also has that magic and sorcery randomly thrown in...maybe Del Toro guest directed along with Tarantino. The point is still that Baccano feels about as American as John Cena eating a cheese burger while riding a bald eagle. Needless to say, it didn't do as well in Japan as it did overseas. Japan as a market is maybe the only country even more self centered than the United States. Narita therefore decided to reboot the series in Japan with Japanese characters in the hopes that it would sell better with domestic audiences. It did. Fortunately for American audience members like me, the series did so well in Japan that it was aired on Adult Swim to the widest possible US audience release and features possibly the most All-Star English voice acting cast of any dub I have ever seen!\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory and characters\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place in Tokyo, where a shy student from the Japanese countryside moves in to go to high school. This student is named Mikado after the 1880s Gilbert and Sullivan musical, which takes place in Japan. Odd fact: despite the fact this old British musical isn't exactly respectful towards Japan and their culture, it is widely popular in the same way that Kazakhs have embraced the movie Borat and especially the fake Kazakh anthem. Mikado meets up with his old friend Masaomi and is given a tour around town. This is where we are first introduced to some of the other ridiculous characters. One character is the brutal bartender Shizuo. Shizuo has superhuman strength because he can't feel pain and is able to push his body beyond its normal limits, even if this damages his body. This is the same explanation as Guts' Berserker armor, which isn't just coincidence. Shizuo hilariously goes into fits of blind rage where he is unable to tell friend from foe. He has devoted his life to killing a pretty boy rival and must fight through endless waves of said rival's minions while screaming the rival's name like a lunatic. He also has a brother named Kasuka, which is spelled very similar to Caska, Guts' love interest from Berserk. What can top a comedic Guts ripoff? How about a headless Irish fairy that rides a motorcycle and fights with a giant grim reaper scythe? Even she isn't the character with the wackiest background. That distinction goes to Semyon Brezhnev. Semyon is the son of a Russian woman and a Black American man who sought political refugee in the Soviet Union during the 1960s...so basically Huey Newton?! He fought for Spetsnaz GRU during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and climbed the ranks due to his superhuman strength. After the USSR fell apart, he randomly moved to Japan and became a sushi chef because...reasons. Let's summarize this: the insinuated bastard son of the Black Panthers founder is a super powered Spetsnaz GRU operative that randomly works in Japan as a sushi chef! Wow! That's what happens when you use Mad Libs to write your character backgrounds. With each episode, we get to meet new characters, learn more background, and see exactly how all these crazy characters connect.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Art:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic and Narita's attention to detail and use of real world locations for background is back with a vengence. One aesthetic difference from Baccano is that Durarara cuts down a LOT on the gore factor. I suppose that allowed it to get a wider release. I don't mind because gore obviously can't by itself make an anime good and its absence here didn't really spoil anything. The soundtrack isn't as catchy as Baccano's but is pretty solid. The voice acting for the English dub as previously mentioned is spectacular. A few episodes in we get a Mexican standoff between Crispin Freeman, Johnny Young Bosch, and Patrick Seitz. Can you possibly ask for more than that!?\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nYou might be wondering why I didn't rate this higher, since I've praised its high production value and zany storytelling. The reason is at least in part because Durarara is a bit of a disappointment following Baccano. By taking place outside Japan and playing with another culture's tropes, Baccano offered a unique outsider's perspective of American pop culture that was rather fascinating to watch. Durarara is a return to Japanese self examination for a domestic Japanese audience, which we've seen in other anime...a LOT. Baccano actually had a unique edge going for it, and they squashed it for the sake of sales. That kind of sucks. Baccano also had a slightly better cast of characters and knew how to balance time between characters. No one fucking cares about Masaomi! He's a boring character that gets WAY too much screen time, while the crazy and fun characters are underutilized. At least Celty got some development, but Semyon is given this ludicrous background...only to get shafted in the anime vs. the original light novels and have maybe 4 minutes of screen time. That would be like in Baccano if Claire Stanfield had all of his scenes save for his introduction cut out, so we could watch Eve Genoard and her maid be boring for 3 whole episodes. That's just fucking cruel to the audience! I never watched an episode of Baccano and thought, \"Ah shit, this episode revolves around that douche bag?!\" Besides the first episode of Baccano, which just sets up the world, every single episode is an absolute blast. Durarara is FAR more hit and miss. Durarara is a fine series by itself and I really did enjoy it, but it still doesn't hold a candle to Baccano!",

It\u2019s the damn Baccano! look-alike it doesn't need a damn story, but okay for the sake of writing a story, I will TRY to explain the things...simply put there are a lot of characters, bizarre characters and oh yea supernatural ones too...taking place in the Japanese town of Ikebukuro the anime follows the adventures of the different characters in short segments and how each of this segments overlap each other to form a much bigger plot. Yes the kind of plot which is too exciting for pulp fiction addicts like me....takes a cue from Baccano! But still I think it achievedits goals perfectly and this is Durarara!! \\n\\n\nAnimation:  Nice art which does a great justice to animation well I particularly have no complaints about it since the style of the story-line compensates for everything else.\\n\\n\nMusic: This one\u2019s predecessor, Baccano! had some awesome Jazz music so this one doesn't disappoint either...from my Favorite 1st opening (Blow up Loud!) to the occasional blues-jazz background music I loved it all...\\n\\n\nSummary: Overall as I said before a must-watch for those who are fond of such crazy intertwining plots...the ride for the head through this anime is really something to cherish. Such an innovative idea in shaping up the story makes it one of the most loved story-lines for me. Having contrasting characters with a touch of comedy makes it just something one should not miss...Just one of the anime I hold in my highest regard and we are also getting a 2nd season for it soon, now don\u2019t that make it more easy to understand the awesomeness of this anime?....so just go on and watch it...\\n",

            "content": "Durarara clearly wants to establish itself as the rule of cool successor to Baccano. Sadly, its just doesn\u2019t have a strong enough cast nor a focused tone to live up to the lively setting of Ikebukuro. \r\nStory (6/10):\r\nDurarara starts off fairly well. It follows in the vein of Baccano in which we follow each and every character\u2019s whereabouts and how they all eventually intervene. It establishes the characters, their relationships with one another, and their issues. And some of the characters  individual stories were downright fun to watch (Anything with Shizuo Heiwajima is a blast). But due to this style, the plot is stretchedout much longer than it needs to be making the viewer forget some details as well as being frustrated as to what's going on. But it all leads up to the climax that surprises, but never really answers the main conflict. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot worsens in the second half as it went from a flawed, but still entertaining ride, to a melodramatic mess. Sure the story becomes more focused, but it also loses a lot of what originally made the show somewhat charming. The inconsistent tone shift from a chill, rather light setting to a more dark and dramatic one was plain jarring. It baffles me that out of all the quirky characters in the roster from the maniplative Izaya to the ironically destructive Shizuo that the show would focus of the three bland high schoolers. They simply don\u2019t have the wit or drive that made me invested in the previous arcs.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the narration, it\u2019s a hit or miss. On some episodes, it\u2019s was used for good effect to emphasize the personalities of certain characters with some clever writing with a great example being in episode 3 (Men with overwhelming power instinctively strike fear into the hearts of others. He\u2019s violence personified. Its what he lives and breathes. Simply put, he\u2019s the very definition of violence). If that's not awesome then I don't know what is. But at it\u2019s worst, the narration can lead to info dumping, over explaining, and redundant recapping of stuff we already picked up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one thing Baccano did right, it was giving almost every character an equal amount of screentime to flesh out their personalities and make them one to remember. Durarara, on the other hand, gives the spotlight to the uninteresting characters which sidelines the quirky characters we actually want to get to know which makes the forgettable characters forgettable and the potential characters forgotten. You can\u2019t deny that you wanted more Shizuo vs. Izaya, more Russia Sushi, and more missions with Celty.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character Mikado is as bland as any protagonist can get. He\u2019s average, wimpy, and just doesn\u2019t stand out no matter how high the stakes can get. Anri is slightly better as we sort of get an insight on why she is the way she is, but she is still uninteresting and you just know a character is shallow when the only thing standing out is her big... (Well, you know). Masaomi is the only one of the three who gets actual development even if it was melodramatic. He still pales to the rest of the cast and can get tiresome at times, but he at least tries to have sort of a chemistry with the other two mains.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are thankfully much more interesting than the mains. Shizuo Heiwajima\u2019s mindset of hating violence, but solving with violence is an absolute joy to watch. He steals the screen every time he\u2019s featured and his individual episode was probably the pinnacle of the shows awesome absurdity. His chemistry with Izaya is miles above the rest of the cast as you can just feel the tense rivalry between the two. Izaya seems to be there as a plot device to explain everything that's happening which can be a bit overbearing, but with such a despicably fun personality I can almost forgive this. Celty, for someone who lacks a head, is probably the most human and likable of the characters which will keep you invested in her arc. As for the rest, they\u2019re quirky and fun, but they have a severe lack of screentime to make them memorable.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nBrains Base does a great job with the detailed backgrounds giving life to Ikebukuro and the animation being smooth for the most part. The show has a unique look to it which gives it identity, As for the background characters being greyed out, i'm not really a huge fan of this. While it gives focus to the featured character, shouldn\u2019t the character have enough features to make him/herself distinct. If not, then this is a clear flaw in character design.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nOpening 1 is fantastic and fits the show very well. It just makes you feel cool when you listen to it. Opening 2, is fitting with the second half of the show in which the show takes a more dramatic turn. Its still a great listen, but it just didn\u2019t hype me up for what was otherwise a disappointing second half while the first opening could hype me up no matter what. I never bothered to listen much to the endings, so I can\u2019t comment much on them other than they simply didn\u2019t stand out.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost for Durarara is what gave the show it's cool status, it\u2019s wild personality, and it\u2019s life in general. As intense jazz plays in the background, you know something is going to go down. As the calm whistles play in the background, you can immerse yourself in the odd city of Ikebukuro. Each piece just sees so fitting and it's something I can listen too on its own. Having seen the dub, it definitely works. Everyone fits their role well from the uncertain Mikado, to the intimidating Shizuo, to the charismatic Izaya, to the curious Celty, this is very well done. The narration is also much easier to listen to for the dub so that's also a plus.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nWatch Baccano first not just for a comparison, but there is also a really great easter egg in one of Durarara\u2019s episodes so be on the lookout. But on its own, Durarara is much less interesting than it pretends to be, but that's not to say that I didn\u2019t enjoy it. After all, it's still reaches rule of cool at points thanks to a fun setting and characters. Overall, I give Durarara a 6/10.",

            "content": "Welcome to Ikebukuro. Let me show you around. Don't mind the occasional torn up sign posts or flying street signs. Or people, for that matter. Now walk these streets and take a gander at life in between the urban bustle. Now, I don't mean to presume but since you've come all this way, there's no doubt you've been looking for some good old-fashioned excitement. If that's the case, you're in the right place. Here in Ikebukuro, excitement's aplenty; you'll never want. In fact, there's also some gossip that's come in that you might find interesting. It's about the Black Rider. Ever heard of it? No?Well, I'll let you in on a secret. Most folks think she's a headless harbinger of death on a motorcycle. Well, the motorcycle bit's true. The headless part too. But she's pretty friendly, actually. Say \u201chi\u201d for me if you happen to see her.\\n\\n\r\nDurarara!! was produced by Brains Base, responsible for other works such as Spice and Wolf II, Natume's Book of Friends, Denpa Teki na Kanojo, and Baccano! Speaking of Baccano!, this show's an adaptation of a novel franchise of the same name by the creator of Baccano!, Ryohgo Narita. Character designs for both the text and anime format were done by Suzuhito Yasuda and Takahiro Kishida respectively. Script was done Toshizou Nimoto. Direction, by Takahiro Omori. From a visual standpoint, the setting's what you'd expect the entertainment district of a major metropolis would feel like given that eccentric anime touch. The backgrounds portray the city well, gleam and grit, and the animation is something to applaud. The fluidity of it may take from from the budget that would have otherwise been used to color in passersby, but it's nothing much to fret about, given how much people are usually strangers to each other in the city anyway. In fact, it's rather clever in how it's made the most of in the show in how much color, when applied, stand out in the sea of gray.\\n\\n\r\nI'd be lying if all the crazy shit that happens in the show wasn't a blast to watch. The strength of the show, however, is undoubtedly its characters. For a show that features such an enormous cast of them, for most to have their own distinct personalities, some neurotic, always entertaining, is worthy of mention. For the majority to sport a good to great amount of depth... that's a remarkable feat. Now, I won't say this reasoning applies to every character, (one seems to exist solely for the ends of trolling people and modeling as a vent for fangirls-by-nature, yaoi included, to squee their throats out) but many of them are linked thematically. Whether it's in school, Ikebukuro, society in general, or the whole of humankind, many tread the border of alienation, between right to joy and left to despair. It's the utmost desire to be wanted, needed, appreciated, and loved in the most genuine of senses. It's the sought after initiative to feel for others in turn. In spite of past traumas. In spite of present hurt. What makes the difference between which direction, left or right, one gravitates to hinges on one's own capacity for genuineness as well: genuineness toward oneself and genuineness toward others. Only then can one belong. This is also why, in spite of criticisms about the show's more drama packed 2nd half, the show requires both clear skies and down casts for its theme to be true as well.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else is genuine about this show is that it has flaws. Major conflicts yet to be satisfactorily resolved are set aside for other pressing developments to take to the fore. Characters that were significant in previous arcs become relegated to minor or cameo roles, while others take up major ones. As a result, the plot can feel unfocused at times. There's also the chance that prominent cast members and their spotlights of the successor arcs pale in comparison to the prominent cast members and their moments to shine of the previous arcs. This isn't to say those arcs are bad, because I quite enjoyed the story to the end. It's just frustrating to get attached to some people and then be forced to endure having them sidelined. The new people we are supposed to be attached to might not be as endearing as our previous favorites. In addition, some characters that were initially introduced with the impression of importance either disappear entirely later on or are added in as after thoughts toward the end. The new characters that appear in the show's 2nd half are guilty of that, though it's a common pitfall that many shows with a large character roster fall into. There were also some issues with how unnatural the new developments were revved up and maintained the story of later arcs. It's not like these happenings came out of nowhere. It's just bugged me how inelegant the foreshadow for these happenings was. A hint toward a development might be dropped and then be altogether forgotten by the show until a good few episodes in where it suddenly becomes convenient to reintroduce it to drive the plot (e.g. The Slasher's identity). Or a suggestion might be reiterated a number of times in a rather obnoxious manner (e.g. Masaomi Kida's past).\\n\\n\r\nBoth Durarara!!'s OPs happen to take a page from Baccano!'s OP mastery of character introductions. All the transitions to each are smooth, seamless, and radiate with a sense of energy and purpose. Both Durarara!!'s OPs happen to reflect the moods they happen to herald. OP1, \u201cUragiri no Yuuyake\u201d or \u201cSunset of Betrayal\u201d by Theater Brook introduces the viewer to the show's more static lighthearted exterior. OP2, \u201cComplication\u201d by ROOKiEZ is PUNK'D segue ways the viewer to it's more dynamic heavyhearted interior. They also sound superb out of context as well, electric guitars and drum set complementing the contemporary rock-tempered rasp of the male lead vocalists as they start the audience small with the rhythm before exploding with fiery flares of passion. If you weren't paying attention to the lyrics, you might have a hard time distinguishing it from certain tracks from American pop rock. Same thing can be said for ED1, \u201cTrust me\u201d by Yuya Matsushita, but with a boy band flair. I'm not too much into boy bands myself, but even I'll admit I found myself humming this song fairly often. It features the significant cast standing on top or clinging to each other in various poses. Something similar can be said for ED2, \u201cButterfly\u201d by ON/OFF, though the poses this time around are horizontally grounded. Guitars and drums are very prevalent, and the voices are lower-pitched than its predecessor ED. Overall, it makes for a good song. It just pales in expressiveness by a fraction compared to the other music selections.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of the negatives, the show's still a lot of fun, and it's nothing particularly mindless either. If you ever happen to find yourself strolling down Ikebukuro's cityscape (figuratively speaking), let me be the first to say this as your guide. Make yourself at home.\\n\\n\r\nI give Durarara!! an 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "At the beginning of the anime I wasn't really full with expactations, since the bit of information I had read about the show didn't really stirr my interest, the only reason for me watching it was me being bored.\r\nSeeing a boy like Ryuugamine Mikado at the very beginning made my head scream \"please, no timid protagonist!!!\". However, seeing Orihara Izaya in the second episode made my expectations jump high, but I'll explain more about that later.\r\nSo I went on watching the show until episode 8 or something like that.\r\nI have to say that at this point it seemed to me like there was no realplot to the story, just some people living their not so normal life in a city called Ikebukuro.\\n\r\nSo I stopped watching the show.\\n\r\nAt some point I ran out of anime with good characters and i remembered a guy called Izaya, so went on watching Durarara!!. \\n\r\nthat was when I realized I had stopped watching just before the story was about to begin. \\n\r\nSeeing as there is a wide field of interesting characters to explore, they had to be introduced during the first 9 episodes. That's when the real plot began:\\n\r\ni saw a heavy character development coming and I didn't want to miss it. I don't want to spoil the show (the rules prohibit it) so I'll try to express myself the best way I can:\\n\r\nThere were lots of heavy decisions to be made by the characters and unexpected identities to be revealed.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the artwork: it isn't really something that amazes you, at least not me. However, it does support the story very well, the different places give off the feeling, they should. For example the headquaters of the Yellow Scarves being an old building, maybe some kind of warehouse, since this is a gang founded by teenagers without the money for a bigger place and not some high class mafia, which makes it more realistic. As much as I know the places shown mostly do exist, excluding Raira Academy.\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, I don't really pay attetntion to the music in anime, movies etc.\\n\r\nHowever, that tiny bit I did notice was always fit to the situation. i want describe this topic any further since my intention is not the analysis of background music.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, up to my favorite part of anime: the characters!\\n\r\nthey were the sole reason for me watching this show. I have to say that I have a bit of a fetish for crazy, kind of evil anime boys. So I was really happy seeing a character like Izaya show up and not only a few times.\\n\r\nI think the wide range of characters presented in this anime has something to provide for anyone (I  don't want to offend anyone or reduce poeple just to their looks in the following part):\\n\r\nA timid innocent boy with character development; \\n\r\nthe happy-go-lucky kind of guy with a not so happy past; \\n\r\na big busted, glasses-wearing school girl, who learns about the values of friends after a tragedy in the past;\\n\r\na crazy informant broker with the hobby of making humans play into his plans; \\n\r\nan uneblievable strong bartender, who wants to live his live in peace;\\n\r\na mysterious, mature female Dullahan, in search for her head;\\n\r\na friendly, somewhat strange doctor; a stalker\\n\r\nand lots more!\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, that my rating was influenced by my love for many strange characters, but even if i didn't I had to say that all of the mentioned aspects play well together and create a unique anime show.\\n\r\nI was really content watching Durarara!! and would recommend it any time.\\n",

            "content": "Let\u2019s say that the soundtrack is exellent. If you happen to find yourself neglected by the people who actually know what\u2019s going on in the series, don\u2019t ponder over your miniature power of understanding and just follow the tune...\r\nAn ordinary boy leaves his small hometown and moves Tokyo. A good point to start the story of the town he\u2019s suddenly in. But it does make you wonder whether the story is about the town itself or the boy we\u2019re following as the main character, since the series itself doesn\u2019t take sides, which is ok in the beginning, but gets confusing as the story progresses. \r\nBaseBrains + Aniplex = beautifully animated, stylish and lively. Dynamic camera movements, nice shots, carefully chosen point of view etc. I don\u2019t want to underestimate anything, but after Kaiba, everything just seems mediocre. What you truly like about the atmosphere is this insisting on the danger, on the dark side of the town. You sit and watch an honest and naive boy in the midst of the urban jungle, all its dangers being presented to you, one by one, (thus bringing in new characters and story elements); wondering is he actually aware of all the things lurking from the dark? \\n\\n\r\nWait. What things? Well, the mysterious part that gets you tangled up in the story in the beginning is very soon explained and elaborated. Too soon, in my opinion. While it does feel necessary, and it is the main drive in all stories containing the horror or mystery element, I still didn\u2019t think that you could uncover what lies behind so recklessly and get away with it. This series did. And when it started uncovering the rest, the disappointment started piling up. \\n\\n\r\nAnd what gets you most is the narrative. It\u2019s mechanical, made to make you think it\u2019s not linear thus cool, as if that meant anything by itself. In order to turn your head away from the potential problems you may imagine developing and deeply damaging the series, you are confronted with a growing pile of main characters, and they\u2019re all positive. The whole series reeks of being world/peace/human/whateverthef loving. In order to cover that up, you are presented with: a question of suicide/sick love/cowardice/WWII aura experiments on humans... \\n\\n\r\nThe characters can\u2019t deliver the message well because they\u2019re omnipotent, and when they clash \u2013 wait, he was omnipotent in the previous episode, so he must win; but if you don\u2019t remember, the other one was also super cool, and he\u2019ll even say it out loud. Just to remind you. And I don\u2019t like that. Recapitulations without a good cause, or to fill the void of oblivion that the character fell into while you were following the other seven having a lazy stroll? I don\u2019t like things falling out of authors hands. I did see a movie once where all characters are bad, and it was a good movie. But having them all good puts you in a position where the real opposition is impossible. How do you solve the problem in the end, who will make the balance; even the police are way out of the line cool. Even if you go with the flow and empathise, the \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d part stabs you in the back. Teenagers need a catharsis too. You can\u2019t just think of them as dumb.\\n\\n\r\nIt did have a good start, though. But the main ingredient failed. The myth you just might have fallen in love with, gets neglected by the author. Or, a less optimistic viewer might say the author didn\u2019t know what to do with it. It\u2019s like you have a god appear in your script and you don\u2019t know what to put in his mouth, so you decide to let him be. But a silent god is still a declaration, so you decide to have him, but have him sleeping. And that\u2019s about it to the series. You won\u2019t hear it.\\n",

            "content": "Well, since there are so many good stuff to say about this anime, I'm not sure where the hell I should start. \r\n  The plot is sophisticated and unique, but surprisingly easy to follow. Though I believe the plot progresses a bit too slow than it could have been not. It took a few episodes to clearly set the characters backgrounds and the relationships taken place before the actual Durarara timeline. However, If you haven't watched Baccano, the idea of these two anime is to set the individual stories and motives for each character and later clash them together. So technically, theplot has been developing since episode one, you just don't see the grandness of it till later. Then BAM! When the plot really starts, I didn't even see it coming. Then when I realized that I didn't see it coming, I was high on pure amazement, respect and delight!\\n\\n\r\n  Anyway, the characters are indeed very interesting (it might be almost safe to say that every character is insane), not to mention very essential to the light philosophy and plot. It's amazing that even this anime is not set in a fantasy setting, the colorful characters themselves shows the staff's overwhelming powerful engine of imagination at work. I can even say that it's better than the manga! There are lots of LOL moments too, thus no time for yawns. \\n\\n\r\n  Only thing I have to complain about is that the very first episode was a rather push-away and non-attention grabbing introduction into the series. I believe this is why the popularity isn't high as it might have been. The director probably wanted to set their popularity based on Baccano! With the ranking on MAL, Durarara!! started as ranked #3xx, then gradually progressed to #48 this week during the first cliffhanger of climax. \\n\\n",

Each episode left off with a minor cliffhanger, but only to fill the next episode with boring and confusing crap until finally giving mediocre answers to our questions. The anime does has some interesting animation and sound, though, while also managing to have extremely well developed characters. However, this show just misses every other mark. If you like so mind numbingly boring and confusing plots go ahead, but I do not recommend Durarara!! to anyone else.\r\nP.S. I did stop 15 episodesin because I felt like watching toilets flush was more exciting and understandable than this ass, but if it does get exciting later according to viewers of the whole series, still don't watch because you will have to bear 15+ terrible episodes.",

            "content": "I really freaking love this anime and I won't lie a big part of it may be nostalgia but the fact that I rewatch it every year and have just as much joy as the first time I watched it is a good show for the quality of this anime.\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nThe story is non-linear, which I love in anime because as it wraps up it doesn't feel like an arc it just feels like a slice in a large multi-flavored cake. It gives you a good taste on what the whole thing is about; however, it still is only a slice in a giant storyand while to some that is annoying I really like it. I do think that if you don't like Masaomi, Mikado, and Anri you will like the story a bit less because the second half does focus on them (as the first half focuses on Celty) and so you may not like the second half as much. I personally love the characters and because of that loved the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\r\nIt's very nice on the eyes and is exceptional at highlighting the characters and showing the characters emotions in a bright or dark way depending. There is a nice highlight on the characters who are important to the story while the background characters are gray and since this anime doesn't try and make every character seem like a shounen main character it helps us see who's the important snowflake out of the snow storm and I love that, because it really gets at the theme of the anime. It helps portray that every person in life is important and interesting and has their own story but this anime focuses on a few select characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\r\nFavorite soundtrack of all time done by Makoto Yoshimori (responsible for Baccano's wonderful soundtrack and Hamatora's quite pleasant soundtrack as well) it really just sets the atmosphere the entire anime and makes me so satisfied the whole ride of the anime. The anime would not be the same without it's soundtrack set at the perfect times and I think that that's the best way to give this soundtrack praise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (11/10)\\n\r\nI think that if I had to say anything about durarara it's that you may not enjoy it as much as everyone else, but there will be one character you will love. In my case I love every character and it's the only anime to throw at me shitty human beings who I still love as characters. There's not a character in Durarara I don't like or enjoy (even the side characters are hilarious or lovable). It's really a character driven plot and the characters interact in such a realistic fluid way that it all feels real. Ikebukuro feels real and the characters cannot be done justice in words. Every character is so unique even though on the outside they feel so similar. They are all multidimensional and have good and bad things about them and YOU, THE PERSON WATCHING WILL PROBABLY RELATE TO AT LEAST ONE OF THEM. You start to care for the characters and hope that everything works out right.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nIt may be the nostalgia talking here but I just love Durarara!! From it's soundtrack to its artstyle to its characters to its fluid pacing and perfect mix of comedy action and characters it just never gets stale for me. I watch it again and again and I never get tired of it and I think the best way to put it is it FEELS natural. Everything about the anime is a pleasure to experience and I highly recommend you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nSome people say it's \"overhyped\" or that that \"the second season is terrible\" but it's just focusing on the characters you yourself don't like or relate too and while that may make you not like it that does not take away from it as an anime. I promise if you watch it you will not be displeased and you will not come away from it regretting you watched it. It's truly a breathtaking original wonderful experience.",

The only thing that left me disappointing was that this series is obviously a \"commercial\" of sorts for the series of light novels.... light novels that will almost certainty never be officially translated. \r\nThe art in Durarara is some of the crispest I've ever seen. Every scene was crafted with 1080p in mind, and you will be missing out if you don't at least watch it in 780p. The aesthetic where unimportant-to-the-plot charactersappear as grey silhouettes allowed the animators to portray Ikebukuro as bustling as it actually is without dumping their entire budget into crowd animation or relying on tacky still-frames. The sights and sounds of the city are perfectly recreated, from humid subway stations to cramped restaurants and dark alleys. It makes you understand how city dwellers fall in love with their cities. \\n\\n\r\nThe story in Durarara is a web of intersecting plots, plans, grudges, and coincidences. It's a character centric story, and the episodes are just as likely to deal with foiling a kidnappings, investigating a corrupt biomedical group, or breaking up a gang war as they are to deal with everyday things such as a visit by obnoxious in laws or sibling relations. It's an interesting mix, as there is quite a bit of drama and action, but there are slice of life elements as the series reminds us that these people's lives do no revolve around the central conflict every waking hour. The downside, due to the fact that the anime is based on an ongoing light novel series, is that many loose threads are left hanging during the last episode.  the plot arc in the second season, dealing with an entity known as \"Saika\", starts out scary but winds up falling face first into every item on the yandere cliche checklist. While it is not enough to scuff the great overall story of Izaya VS pretty-much-everyone, the use of those cliches did put a damper on what was otherwise a very original tale. \\n\\n\r\nAs stated before, characters are Durarara's strong point, and it has a ton of them. It's almost too much of a good thing, as there's not enough screen time to divide amongst the two-dozen-plus fully fleshed out characters. While Celty may be the main character, Durarara treats nearly everyone's story as equally important. Unlike Narita's preceding work to be adapted to anime, \"Baccano!\", Durarara only jumps from character to character, instead of jumping from year to year AND character to character like the former.\\n\\n\r\nMusically Durarara has a solid soundtrack with quite a few memorable pieces. While there are some mishaps (such as the violin piece that's supposed to play during heartwarming scenes but instead invokes an aura of cheesiness) the overall quality of the soundtrack overshadows it's flaws. The jazz pieces are especially great, capturing the atmosphere of a city at night perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Durarara is an experience unlike anything else and worth checking out. It's a fun ride that's over far too soon.",

Well, I actually dropped this quite many times, but decided to finish it given that I haven't watched much mystery anime at the time. And it was so bad so that I remember how terrible this is though it's been quite some time since I completed this anime.\r\nIt just feels like waste of words to write this for long so I'll just make each section shorter than my other reviews.\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nDurarara just starts off by putting out justloads of characters without any depth. Many look the same so I couldn't tell which was which. And there are just too many characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe element of surprise was basically non-existent. As a mystery genre, it's just really bad when an average person like can me can see how the story will turn out. \\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely terrible pacing. Well it just takes forever for the story to start. And it just feels all drab just like the art style. It was an anime I didn't regret skipping some parts.\\n\\n\r\nI personally thought I could have come up with a better story. This is just too far below average.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nAll are just dark, with no substance. The background just seems like that little work was done.

            "content": "Durarara!! is one of those anime that can surprise the viewer in so many ways, both bad and good, but in the end this diversity is what enriches the spectacle. In these 24 episodes it managed to blend ostensibly different story themes, in a quite successful final result.\r\nFrom gang fights to urban legends, friendships and rivalries, schemers and victims, its themes target all kinds of audiences, making it really easy for a larger group of people to enjoy it.\r\nStory \u2013 8 The story is set in Tokyo\u2019s Ikebukuro enhanced with a more supernatural, mysterious feel to it and is a mixed bag of comedy, action,drama, fantasy and almost every single theme imaginable. At the start and for the first half, the series consists of small story arcs, basically introducing and getting a little deeper to the background of the main characters with usually every episode being narrated by one or two of the show\u2019s characters. This setting is quite unique and interesting but a bit lacking in consistency. The pacing is slow since it feels like it drags more than it should until all of the introductions are made and the real story starts not before the tenth or so episode, resulting to the viewer not being able to predict the goal of the main story until quite later on. The last seven or eight episodes take a clearer path but leave some sub stories unanswered. Although not story driven in the start, it has a captivating style created by the city\u2019s backdrop. Overall the plot is intriguing enough to keep an interest in it and with nice cliffhangers in each episode\u2019s ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 10 The art is a delight for the viewer\u2019s eye. A rainbow of bright colors, which also plays a major part in the story. The city of Ikebukuro is rendered in all those colors together with the people important in the story, with all the rest in shades of gray. The city gangs identify themselves from the colors, like the Blue Squares and the Yellow Scarves, etc. The characters are drawn very nicely and in detail. It\u2019s important that the art and story work supplementary as the art is not a mere enhancement but a major part of the plot itself. \\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 9 Starting from the opening and ending themes, the music of the songs together with the lyrics highlight the style of the anime. The background music is setting the mood throughout the series and stands out; it is unique in its own way as all the aspects of this series. Memorable and catchy themes are repeated effectively whenever to give the setting of certain scenes, as for example a fight scene or a riddle.\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting I will just mention that a whole group of successful and well known seiyuu is gathered for all the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 9 With Ikebukuro as the backdrop of the story, all different kinds of characters appear in this series. There is the protagonist, Ryugamine Mikado a young boy who comes for the first time to stay in Tokyo and is usually reserved and quiet, Kida Masaomi, his childhood friend who lives in Ikebukuro and is more social and easy-going as well as has a thing for the opposite sex. Then there\u2019s Heiwajima Shizuo, a ridiculously strong man with a weak temper, Orihara Izaya a cunning young man with a passion for studying humans and their behaviours and a bad habit to provoke Shizuo resulting in them being in a constant fight relationship. Sonohara Anri, a classmate of both Mikado and Kida, for whom both boys share a special interest. Also the story takes a more supernatural turn with the presence of the black rider, an urban legend that rides around the city not on a horse but on a motorbike! A lot of more interesting and diverse characters make their appearance throughout the series making their reactions all more interesting. Without devaluing the very clever story, the series looks more character driven shaping the plot from their interactions. Despite the paradox of the settings, the characters feel real and don\u2019t fall into the usual anime norms, which is definitely refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 8 (first half \u2013 7, second half 9)\\n\\n\r\nFrom being indifferent the story can change the viewer to be anxiously waiting for the next episode. With its peaks and its drops it\u2019s a rollercoaster ride that one should get on for sure. Experiencing unsatisfactory moments that surprisingly turn into the best cliff-hangers the next minute, this show surely doesn\u2019t walk a straight line. But wouldn\u2019t an expectedly successful path be boring? The satisfaction from it comes from the fact that it\u2019s so diverse. And that\u2019s what keeps it from falling into the usual clich\u00e9, and on the contrary it  makes it so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 8\\n\\n\r\nThis anime mixes the past with the modern era reshaping old legends in a modern setting. It brings out the dynamic of a city such as Tokyo, with all its sci-fi, mysterious feeling and combines it with tradition. In this downtown district of Ikebukuro it feels like everything can happen, creating a dream-like reality that in the end it feels more real than the actual one. In this solid and powerful setting usual human interactions appear such as friendships, rivalries, schemes, pranks, although rendered on a different, maybe deeper level. \\n\r\nIt would be briefly summarized as \"a focus on human interactions in a big city environment with some supernatural doses\" ( which character Izaya Orihara who loves humans would be very pleased about\u2026)\\n\r\nSo if someone is on the search for an unusual, beautiful medley of stories, images and characters set in a full of enchanting riddles city as Tokyo, then this anime will offer some unparalleled and sort of sophisticated moments.",

            "content": "'Welcome to Ikebukuro.'\r\n\"Durarara!!\" is the story of a boy who came to the big city with hopes of escaping his boring and ordinary life, as he encounters many extraordinary people and strange events in the big city that is Ikebukuro.\r\nSTORY: 7/10\r\nThis may be a bit harsh since we live in an era where everything's been done before and recycled plotlines are hard to avoid, but the story of \"Durarara!!\" is like a bunch of previous Japanese works patched together.\r\nUnveiling of the characters and exploration of loneliness in Tokyo in first half, as well as the intertwining events/lives and search for the extraordinary lives is acarbon copy of 2009 film \"Lala Pipo\" (2005 novel). This may be excused since this series was produced by many of the same staff from \"Baccano!\", but the similarity was disturbing.\\n\\n\r\nThe general atmosphere and gang war aspect in the second half is almost identical to the infamous dorama \"Ikebukuro West Gate Park\" (IWGP). In fact, the main color gang even had yellow identification color just like IWGP, so was the gang leader's jester personality and Heiwajima Shizuo as the invincible fighter (though he's in different gang and strength was significantly beefed up).\\n\\n\r\nThen you have Orihara Izaya, who's pulling strings from behind the scenes like controlling chess pieces, much like the duo from \"Death Note\".\\n\\n\r\nI did like the concept of cyber-gang community Dollars and the three-way standoff as leaders for gangs, though not sure if they've been ripped off from some other contemporary works...\\n\\n\r\nIndividual segments of the story may be unoriginal, but they were fused well together to make a story as a whole. The entire show had a consistent atmosphere and pacing, and surprisingly, the modernized Dullahan didn't seem to be forced into the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was slightly disappointing for me, since\\n\r\neverything worked out too well. It felt like they were trying too hard to make an 'everyone's happy' ending.\\n\r\nFortunately, we can expect much darker story if they ever decide to make a sequel, judging from plot synopses of following novels.\\n\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 9/10\\n\r\nThe photo-realism of the background and simplicity of the characters generated a unique atmosphere for this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe background has extreme detail, with enough deliberate flaws (such as fading street lines, stained asphalt, individually colored bricks etc) and natural reflection of light to make them seem more than just drawings. What makes them seem even more realistic is that certain locales are exact reenactment of the actual city. The JR station in the first episode, for example even used their actual, un-altered logo. There were many other scenes where I actually recognized the backgrounds, and even the stores like Tokyu Hands and Wendy's had the original logo designs with minimal alteration in spellings.\\n\\n\r\n3D-CG was applied very effectively, mostly used only to retain realistic form for moving backgrounds, and 'painted' over so that CG doesn't stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are often drawn without even having shadows on their faces. However, character design was anything but generic, and quite memorable. The simplicity also makes the smooth movements possible. While some characters' faces were slightly idealized, they all had proper proportions, and distinct fashion sense that you'll encounter in the actual city.\\n\\n\r\nThe background characters (or extras, if this was live action) were monochrome outlines. I personally don't like this technique being overused throughout the series, but as usual, it worked very well in certain scenes to show the busyness of the city and one's insignificance in society. Of course, it also brings out the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nI would say there was very little room for improvement in animation considering the atmosphere they were trying to create. Although there could've been a lot more surreal scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\r\nVoice acting done very well, especially for Kida, whose voice was somewhat unique and showed massive variance from when he's serious to joking. The entire cast were noticeably motivated. You can tell they gave everything they've got, especially in dramatic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThis may be a personal opinion, but I firmly believe a seiyuu's skill is measured by quality of his/her narration. It's something that you can't bullshit through, and truly talented voice actors are capable of moving the audience by subtly expressing emotion in seemingly unemotional dialogs. \"Durarara!!\" had different narrators for almost every single episode, and I feel I really connected with almost every characters by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic score was pretty good, often essential in setting the atmosphere. There was a particular clown-ish, jovial piece that really impressed me.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't find any of the OP/ED to be catchy, but use of recaps as preview for each episode in middle of OP was a wonderful idea, especially since many episodes consisted of overlapping time lines from different perspective or a mystery in the past episode solved. It also removed the necessity for an entire recap episode for new audiences in middle of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters are the most intriguing part of this series, without being outright ridiculous *cough* Arakawa *cough*\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is Ryuugamine Mikado, seemingly an ordinary boy who's curious about everything about the big city he moved into for high school. Other than his super-cool name and secret background, I would say that he is THE Mr. Average, even that he so bland that he doesn't have a personality.\\n\\n\r\nLike \"Baccano!\" there are many main characters with nearly equal screen time, each of them with unique backgrounds and interests that eventually converge. (\"Baccano!\" cameos and that particular episode was epic too.)\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting of such characters were Celty and Heiwajima. Celty Sturluson represents the mystique this big city Ikebukuro has to offer. Other than having kick ass 'horse' and method of communication, her character was the most complex out of all the cast in the series, ironically making her the most human out of all. Then you have Heiwajima Shizuo on the other side of the scale. Despite the fact that he is a human being, his monstrous power is just absurd with attention span of a child and serious temper tantrums. He's like the coolest walking destruction.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the story focuses on the unveiling of the characters' unique backgrounds rather than actual development.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 8.5/10\\n\r\n\"Durarara!!\" attempts to explore a large number of extremely common themes in Japanese media such as personal barrier, search for meaning in life, violence as a form of love, responsibility as leader etc, but none particularly as in-depth as they could've been.\\n\\n\r\nIt is still the series that left me the most lasting impression this season though, with unique animation, sounds, and characters. The story lacked focus, but the pacing was excellent and kept me interested throughout the 24 episodes. What this series had, was the magic, and I will definitely watch another season if it ever comes out.",

            "content": "Durarara is nothing like Baccano, I can guarantee you that. Don't be fooled by its action scenes, non-linear storytelling or awesome opening sequence. Durarara is a ride which twists your insides really tight then suddenly explodes in your face.\r\nStory: 7/10.\r\nIts uniqueness lies in the story. What makes Durarara stand alone is its depth into the dark side of human psychology. This anime tackles suicide, exceptional forms of love and abuse. These aspects are hidden within the main focus of comic relief and fast paced action. Not to mention its fair share of the supernatural, from souls possession to urban legends.\r\nDurarara has such a large castthat it sweeps you up in the urban atmosphere of Ikebukuro, Tokyo. It has the uncanny talent of having that realistic feeling that despite the significance of your action, you are just another human in the curious impersonal place of Ikebukuro, Tokyo. \\n\\n\r\nThe storyline itself starts with each episode focusing on one character. You are rewound to the character past experiences and thoughts that have shaped them and others to the present. Every character moves forward in the present, cleverly overlapping each other and tying the several linear storylines together. Secrets start to emerge, and suddenly you find yourself agitated on the edge of your seat for the unpredictable ride through gang wars, borderline zombie fighting and politics. The tension inside Durarara always makes you hungry for more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nHow realistic the emotions that give each character depth is astonishing. You are given a whole glimpse of the spectrum, from psychopaths to a girl who knows naught of love. Character development occurs simultaneously with the storyline as each character tries to find peace, themselves and resolutions to whatever haunts them from the past. The anime is then able to tie it all together with the development of complex character relationships. As each one evidently finds out secrets and thus the storyline unfolds. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10. Sound: 7/10.\\n\r\nEye candy. The characters are drawn beautifully, the scenery is spectacular. A must to watch in HD. Feast your eyes. The opening and ending soundtrack fit the anime perfectly. It certainly throws you into the upbeat Durarara atmosphere. The OST compliments the anime, particularly giving mystical, thriller scenes an eerie, chilling effect.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10. Overall: 8/10.\\n\r\nPersonally, Durarara is nothing I expected. Being action and emotion packed, it is certainly a unique experience to remember. I leave you with the sentence in the opening paragraph; Durarara is a ride which twists your insides really tight then suddenly explodes in your face.",

            "content": "Ah gee, I really thought this show was going to evolve into something great. I honestly held my seat as thought I was going up a scary roller-coaster, only to be splashed after the first hill in the pool of disappointment. I don't mind water coasters but my cash got soggy. That how I feel after I purchased this from Amazon. I was promised greatness and at the end I just got wet. The kind of wet that makes me avoid this area in the theme park so it's safe to say I won't visit the sequels or specials. \r\nStory was ominous early, but asmore secrets are revealed through the show my only reaction could have been, \"Oh\". I'm being honest, I think every point or heading this show has was time filler. Nothing mattered. It didn't matter. I was just forced to attempt to care for the facts and then hope everything goes well for a character I liked? I couldn't bring myself to enjoy any of the characters. 6/10, mediocre, at best.\\n\\n\r\nArt was pretty boring to me. They tried to visualize the inner-city 'hood' but it seemed they only knew how by removing light and adding dirt. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI had purchased a dual-package with a dub and a Japanese version with English subs. The dub was so awful, they could've used Cortana or Siri, or freaking Stephen Hawking to produce more range of emotion in their voice. \\n\r\nThe sub version was better, I don't know Japanese but their voices didn't boil me over in a rage. 5/10, don't contract out to bad dubbers. \\n\\n\r\nI know this leans towards a drama more than any other genre. However, Every. Single. Character were intense drama queens with over the top reactions. The only one who was reasonable through the whole show wasn't even human. They might've meant it, but I knew they didn't because they weren't even reasonably believable as 'secrets' were revealed. 6/10 characters that deserved to better secrets.\\n\\n\r\nTo end the rant, I want to point out that I did enjoy the beginning. The more they revealed the big secrets the less I became surprised, with a general reaction of 'finally' or 'duh'. I really just don't get how this is so popular. 6/10",

            "content": "At first I wasn't particularly sure whether or not to watch this, I thought hmm \" Headless rider?\", \"Gang wars?\" this seemed pretty stupid, but yet again my boredom got to me and i decided to give it a go. In the end, one of the best decisions i had ever made this anime is definitely on my top anime list, what makes this great is that this is one of the few animes that left me sitting on my chair completely stunned and amazed at what I had just witnessed on screen thinking \"Fuck me....\"\r\nStory 10\r\nAt first this anime was pretty slow with notmuch happening during the first couple of episodes, but I guess they were for the sake of introducing characters, but one thing that i did like what they did was that they did an episode on each MC perspective of that day/even and have them narrate their own feelings at that time, not something you see in a lot of animes, to be honest first time i had ever seen it. Shortly after that the story picked up, it started focusing more on the urban legends that lead to characters developing their relationship's with each other, tensions between the 3 factions (Dollars, Yellow scarves, Slashers) that puts 3 best friends relationship to the test by some guy (Izaya) who is constantly trolling everyone 24/7 in the background, which was actually pretty amazing to witness the way he trolled everyone without anyone noticing, it was like watching Lelouche from code geass all over again =P. The anime ended pretty well, it was a nice and simple way to end everything that occurred throughout although I personally think it could have been better, or at least have Mikado and Anri confess to each other >.>\\n\r\nArt 8 \\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty well done, it had that old classic feel, plus i quite liked how they made all the characters that didn't speak grey, it made the ones that did speak stand out more creating a nice little effect in my opinion. Most of the character design was quite well down, Izaya's character design gave off that same feeling as L from death note, that feeling off \"Shit this guy probably knows everything\". Kida with his delinquent look was quite good as well, it gave viewers an idea about what his past what could have been and why he change his look. the art around Celty was pretty good, as in her shadow techniques, like her weapons and ways to scare off people, they weren't overly detailed and was quite simple. They were often some quite epic poses/moves with her scythe as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8\\n\\n\r\nThe OST was pretty good in this, it really set the mood in certain scenes, especially the horror ones or the ones when something amazing will happen, but i liked the fight scene OST the best it made the fight seemed more epic and exciting even though it was just a normal fist fight... The 2 openings was pretty catchy to listen to, and i especially liked how they had a little recap section during the song i thought that was pretty cool, it actually made me listen to the whole opening every time which is quite rare!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9 \\n\\n\r\nKida, Anri and Mikado character was pretty well done, their personality meant that they needed to rely on each other, which created quite a special atmosphere when the 3 started falling apart, plus Kida's personality always led to some funny moments come up from time to time. Celty's character was quite unexpected, when we think of monster or supernatural monsters in anime we think \"probably something strong, and not easily scared\" while Celty is strong, she gets scared pretty easily to the point where she's scared of traffic cops... Who knew Dullahan was scared of traffic cops. Shizou was a pretty interesting character, a short tempered guy who hates violence, yet despite his hatred for violence his actions tend to always contradict him. But my favourite character is probably Izaya, man that guy literally trolls everyone 24/7 no wonder Shizou hates him so much, although I loved it when he messes around with people.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\\n\r\nThis was a very enjoyable anime for me, there was countless scenes that made me sat their stunned thinking \"WHATTTTTTTTT?!!\". It was pretty interesting watching how Izaya play around with everyone thinking that their pawns, man that guy literally thinks he's god i swear. While there were many epic scenes especially the Dollars first meet up, this anime does have a few comical scenes such as Shizou and Izaya's fight, or Simon and his sushi comments, they were pretty amusing to watch. Oh and i loved it when they made references to other animes, especially the Shakugan no Shana model =P.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10 \\n\\n\r\nThere is hardly any bad points in this anime, and if i had to give one i would say the ending could have been better, it wasn't anywhere as epic compare to the rest of series. But other than that I enjoyed this anime quite a lot, it had that same epic feeling you always get when watching Code geass. For viewers that like an anime where there is a guy in control of everything in the background, and likes a bit of horror and comedy, Durarara is something you should definitely watch, and if your done and want some more, go check out the dollars website online and be prepared to be amazed at how similar it is to the anime one!",

            "content": "Durarara!! is an amazing creative anime. Let\u2019s break down why! \r\nThis review is spoiler free. :D \r\nCharacters: 8/10\r\nThis is a tough category to rate because I enjoy most of the cast, love some of them, and find three in particular horribly boring (so boring I have my overall rating a 8/10 instead of 9/10). There are some stock characters that I find hilarious if one-dimensional. There are characters I love and relationships I find mature, highly entertaining, and unique.  \r\nBut there is also Mikado Ryugamine. Of all the characters he is, unfortunately, the main one. He has the personality of a white bread andwatching him is about as fun as watching paint dry. His friends (also, sadly, main characters) aren\u2019t much better. One, at first, seems like nothing but fan service but later becomes interesting. His other friend starts funny but gets too \u201cangsty\u201d towards the end for me. \\n\\n\r\nBut, if you can get past these three, the cast is nothing short of amazing. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs far as plot goes, Durarara!! doesn\u2019t not have the grandest plot. To be frank, the plot seems somewhat irrelevant in comparison to how the story is told. It unfolds in a way similar to a Russian novel or Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune. You will see several repeated scenes in Durarara!!. In the one episode, Character A may have brushed the shoulder of Character B. First, you see the scene from Character A\u2019s perspective, but, later, in a later episode, you will see what Character B was doing during that scene. The characters seem connected by stings that interweave in each others\u2019 lives.  It\u2019s brilliant, different, and interesting, but it does make for a bit of slow moving plot. However, once all those stings connect the whole patterns comes together in a fun adventure.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (and cinematic in general): 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nWith bright and bold colors that fit the \u201cdanger: stay out\u201d scheme of the whole show, I have noting to complain about here. Fights are easy to follow. The characters\u2019 faces stay consistent. The outfits are cool. You get the picture. \\n\\n\r\n(music): I don\u2019t have much to say here. I can\u2019t remember it being particularly amazing or horrible. I\u2019m going to guess that it worked well with the show. \\n\\n\r\n(angles): Most anime don\u2019t pay too much attention to this, but Durarara!! offers different shots that allow that you to see the bigger pictures (aka. Character A and B) if you\u2019re paying attention. They didn\u2019t just slap down random angles but it seems they actually thought about it.\\n\\n\r\n(intro/outro): Love the first intro and outro. They fit the tone of the show and have great songs. Second ones are a little weaker but not bad. \\n\\n\r\nFan service: 3/10 \\n\\n\r\nYou WANT a low score here (if you care about female representation). While one girl has large boobs and is often called \u201cbooby-licious\u201d, the show largely avoids titillating the audience with up-skirt shots and girls who just happening to be changing as they talk.  No pointless clothing damage while fighting either. There is one scene where a girl undergoes torture while naked, but the scene is not meant to be a turn-on, is brief, and doesn't show much.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is more than one version of fan service. This show does throw some fun bones for the audience to chew on. But I don\u2019t spoil those. \\n\\n\r\nFemale Representation: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main characters, Celty, is a female. A headless Dullahan, she talks through text messages and is one of my favorite characters. Females fair rather well in the anime, serving as more than just tag-alongs for the male leads (also, this show as one of my favorite heterosexual ships! It's healthy, functional, and based on more realistic emotions and mature reactions).\\n\\n\r\nSub vs Dub:\\n\\n\r\nI watched it in dub and enjoyed it immensely. It has some of my favorite voice actors, and I recommend it. That being said, I haven\u2019t watched the sub. As far as I know, that\u2019s great too. \\n\\n\r\nWarnings:\\n\\n\r\nOne character speaks mainly through text messages, so make sure that, when you watch it, those have been translated into English. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, one character speaks in Russian, which is often subtitled in Japanese at the bottom, which doesn\u2019t help English speakers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWithout Mikado Ryugamine and his blond-haired sidekick, this show is a hands down a 9/10. Sadly, those two drove me up a wall and forced me to lower my score an entire point. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is original and a blast. It has got something for everyone and I highly recommend it. \\n",

            "content": "\"Durarara!!\" was a fun ride... for the most part. With a intriguing premise, and a HUGE and fun cast of characters, the show held a lot of promise. However, expectations were quickly diminished after the first 12 episodes...\r\nThe story itself is rather simple, yet expansive. We're given a deep look at a lot of the character's lives, and that's mainly what the show revolves around. Episodes 1-12 were enough to make you interested, and held promise. However, the story drops off after that, and until the end of the show, we spiral downwards into a sea of unrealistic character actions and motivations, as well asgeneral plot points.\\n\\n\r\nThe main three (who are the primary focus 13 and onwards) have to be some of the blandest characters I've seen in a while. Their interactions are annoying, and none of them never really grow or develop into something better.\\n\\n\r\nCelty's storyline is dropped half-way through, with what feels like half-assed reasoning. Izaya is interesting and fun, but his record-player statement of \"Humans are interesting!\" certainly isn't enough to back up his actions. Shizuo is awesome. Simon is weird, but cool. Kyohei's crew is awesome, especially Erika.\\n\\n\r\nArt is good and conveys the setting well, though the quality drops off a bit after the half-way point, but it still gets the job done. Both OPs and EDs are FANTASTIC!\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to episodic value, it was below average. I wish I could say otherwise, but if 45% of your show is sub-par, there's obviously something wrong.\\n\\n\r\n\"Durarara!!\" was a fun start that held a lot of potential, but panned out to be something that wasn't cohesive, and lacked direction.",

The clusterfuck near the end wouldn't have enough impact if the characters were weak. Additionally, even the characters you rarely see are developed in a way that makes them memorable. I watched the subbed version and a bit of the dubbed to see how I felt about it and I feel like both did an excellent job of aligning voice actors with character design. It has a great balance of action and suspense with comedy, making it a feel good anime with enough substance to be engaging.",

            "content": "After watching, finishing and really enjoying Baccano I started Durarara!! With really, really high expectations of a great story, plot and an anime that would keep me interested the whole way through. Let me just say I was sadly disappointed.\r\n-----------Criteria----------- \r\nStory: 6.5 \r\nAlthough a new and original story, one that I\u2019ve never heard or seen before, it seems like the story just ended at around episode 12 or 13 and then they decided to drag it out for some reason. As the description mentions it\u2019s about a mythical Irish urban legend a dullahan \u201cblack rider\u201d or \u201cheadless rider\u201d which makes an appearance in the Japanesecity of Ikebukuro. The story is about a dullahan and the mysterious events that unravel around the dullahan. After they confirm the mystery of who the dullahan is and who\u2019s behind the dollars everything goes downhill, a little up and then crashes with the ending.\\n\\n\r\nEnding: 5 \\n\r\nI don\u2019t think the ending could\u2019ve gotten any more \u2018shounenier\u2019. It was too happy and \u2018lovey dovey\u2019 for an anime that isn\u2019t supposed to be purely romance based (even if was romance based the romance is really bad). I at least half expected someone to die due the fact that the climatic buildup of mystery and thrill in episodes 20-23 makes you expect that someone from the main 3 characters will have a tragic or heroic end. But it all come crashing down in episode 24 with a typical \u2018the love birds run off to a happily ever after\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nSolid Plot: 5 \\n\r\nAs previously stated I found that after the mystery of the dullahan gets out in the open both the plot and story seem to just drag on. In the second half of Durarara!! There are things that are either unnecessary or add an element to the plot and story that doesn\u2019t end up getting resolved. For instance the really big matter with the dullahan\u2019s head, they should\u2019ve dropped it at episode 12 or 14 but decided to bring a new element of mystery to it but saying a war will be the catalysts for the birth of a Valkyrie \\n\\n\r\nMoral: 9  \\n\r\n2 really great morals touched on in Durarara the first in episodes 1-12 being that everyone is fine with the way they are no matter what deficiencies they have. The second touched on episodes 13-24 via a direct use of the dollars, is that if we all band together and act as one, we can help each other out with any task big or small.\\n\\n\r\nSense: 8 \\n\r\nSeeing as they explain everything in quite some detail it does make a lot of sense. The background/history of the characters comes into play when trying to understand character choices and reasoning and once taken into consideration we can understand the choices they\u2019ve made.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8 \\n\r\nExcellent opening song and use of oxymoron\u2019s and expressions within it. \u201cReality is a picture drawn on a black stained tomorrow\u201d \u201cWrithing and Shinning\u201d, what this is supposed to mean I will leave up to you but many different ideas can be taken from this.  Music played during happy, sad, and suspenseful and action scenes are also complementary to the mood of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 \\n\r\nThe art style was excellent everything from character design to natural effects (fire, water, day, night). Can\u2019t really say a lot about the art work except for the fact that it was excellent and one of the highest points of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5 \\n\r\nPossible the biggest high point yet also the biggest problem with this series. Character design to emotions to character development was amazing too amazing in fact that it can\u2019t get a perfect 10 due the fact that I feel they focused too much on developing the characters that they neglected the most important part of any anime: story and plot development. I felt that the anime should\u2019ve ended after episode 12 with a dramatic close after revealing one of the series biggest secrets. Unfortunately the one and only character shrouded in complete mystery and you want to know more about they leave you nearly completely clueless on, Orihara Izaya. Where did he learn to fight? How did he become so good at gathering information? What does it take to become his disciple (Saki Mikajima)? How does he know Russian? And a lot more unanswered questions.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Score: 4  \\n\r\nLike I\u2019ve said previously I really believed that they should\u2019ve done the same thing they did with Baccano, a nice short 12-13 episode series that has a really good story and plot to it. Though in short my personal opinion would be to watch up to episode 13 then stop, I also wouldn\u2019t re-watch it.\\n\r\n:POSSIBLE SPOILERS: If you\u2019re like me and only if you\u2019re like me, then really nothing can get past you when it comes to secrets. The leader of the dollars figured it out by episode 6, the real Slasher got that by episode 15, and previous leader of the Yellow Scarfs got that by 16. The only thing that caught me off guard was who Harima Mika is; but even then I had a feeling she was a head or a body\u2026. Also the biggest thing I hated about this was Mikado\u2019s resolve for creating the dollars \u2018it started off as a prank which turned into something bigger\u2019, \u2018I didn\u2019t leave because I thought I could make Ikebukuro a better place\u2019. But then when shit hits the fan he packs his bags and hightails it out of there thinking that if he leaves it\u2019ll reduce the amount of  \u2018shit\u2019 on the fan. Like world revolves around him? Also I don\u2019t think they could\u2019ve made this anime any more \u2018shouneny\u2019, if they literally took out the blood and the swearing than this anime would be suitable to watch by a 13 year old audience, though they\u2019d find it pretty hard to understand.  \\n\\n\r\n------Genres-------\\n\r\nAction: 4.5 \\n\r\nVery little action scenes, that only last between 5-10 seconds max when we clearly want to see more of Shizou vs. Izaya.\\n\\n\r\nMystery: 4 \\n\r\nThe only thing that didn\u2019t stop me from turning it off even though its element was still so low. I was always waiting for that big thing or event to happen that would completely mind blow me\u2026.never came. Also unfortunately pretty much 95% of all discussed mysteries are incredibly easy to solve. 1 or 2 mysteries may come as shock but you would\u2019ve expected half of the answer already. Some mysteries also have no relevance or a simply dropped, such as the case of the disappearing people.\\n\\n\r\nSupernatural: 4 \\n\r\nI don\u2019t really know how Durarara passes as a supernatural genre anime seeing as there a possible only 2 elements that are \u2018supernatural\u2019. The first being the Dullahan, the second the Slasher and they don\u2019t even qualify as being really supernatural seeing as 90 percent of the time they show both the Dullahan and Slasher and regular ordinary people.  \\n\\n\r\nGang: 5   \\n\r\nThe gangs didn\u2019t really make any sense to me. After the war between the Yellow Scarfs and Blue Squares which the Yellow Scarfs ended up winning, the Yellow Scarfs gladly welcomed any Blue Squares member to their side. Stuff like that usually doesn\u2019t happen between gangs. They don\u2019t become all \u2018lovey dovey\u2019 after a fight like they were \u2018bros\u2019.\\n\r\nThough really overall and in short if you\u2019re smart as in educated i.e you\u2019re able to make accurate assumption form only 1 clue, than don\u2019t watch this coz nothing will come as a surprise. However if you\u2019re pretty slow and don\u2019t catch on to things that quickly (most people these days) than this is the perfect anime to keep you entertained for a good 8 hours. Personally for me I would not rewatch no matter what, some people said they found it unpredictable; I went through this anime like an open picture book; with only a few things coming as a surprise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (Average) - 5.6875",

            "content": "Durarara is one of those shows which can seem fun looking at first, but deep down, is actually a poorly written show. It is a true waste of good voice actors, good premise and by the time the show ends, nothing has truly changed.\r\nWhy? Because of lack of a simple principle: SHOW, DON'T TELL.\r\nSince the era of entertainment, SHOW, DON'T TELL is an integral part of any show. And it does not mean to focus only on the visual elements, however, it means to leave as much elements of the story line to the viewer's imagination, while bringing about the story. Even exposition, where thereis a lot of talking, can use the principle of show, don't tell by intriguing the audience into the slight hints about the character and also the setting. The principle of world building is built upon this very rule. You don't show the city immediately without discussing about it beforehand and bringing some facts and unique characteristics about the city, making the viewer imagine these to allow for a greater experience. Similar to how the idea of eating a pizza is a lot appetizing than the pizza itself, \"Show, don't tell\" is a part of entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this is so badly violated in Durarara. For starters, EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER HAS AN EPISODE WHERE THEY HAVE AN EXPOSITION. EVERY DETAIL ABOUT THEIR LIFE IS DISCUSSED IN LENGTH. IT IS DONE SO BADLY THAT YOU MIGHT BE MISTAKEN THAT THEY WERE RECITING THE LIGHT NOVEL. See how the previous sentences looked like I was shouting to you? in a similar fashion, the anime goes out of its way to throw all the facts and force them DOWN YOUR THROAT. See how discomfortable that can be? This turns people off.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, when someone does something, every single character's thoughts are voiced so often, which makes it impossible to sympathize with these characters. Why? If you know what a character is like, and what he/she will do, they become tooo predictable. And you cannot seriously comprehend what went wrong with them when they do something too emotionally. Again, \"SHOW, DON'T TELL\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nA testament to this fact is Izaya Orihara, a man whose character/life is never explored or told in the anime, however, he remains just as intriguing and mysterious enough to be the only CHARACTER in this entire anime to be likable. And HE IS THE VILLAIN FOR GOD'S SAKES. Imagine how badly the anime should be when the villain is the only one you can root for?!\\n\\n\r\nBecause every single character in this show is just a spoilt kid whining to the audience about how bad their life is, it makes us senseless to their actions and makes them hated. RIGHTFULLY TOO. I mean, the thoughts in each one of their minds DISGUST me. The headless biker thinks about how cool a guy fighting is despite the fact that said guy is doing nothing cool. A outsider thinks that a murderous psychopath with another lady giving him love advice must be cool as fuck. In just what world does that work??\\n\\n\r\nIn the end of this show, I was just happy that I was able to run off this stupid piece of shit story. The fact that the sequels to this anime aired only after five years and also by a different studio is testament to this effect.\\n\\n\r\nI rate this show a 1/10 because of just this violation that ruined everything. And just as an advice to other anime, and entertainment in general, ALWAYS LEAVE SOMETHING TO THE AUDIENCE'S IMAGINATION. That's the only way to get your audience invested in the characters and also the story. Don't become the train wreck that is Durarara!!(Exclamation mark unintended)\\n\\n\r\nEnd of review, SPOILERS AHEAD.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: I hated that big boobs girl. She was a slut if you ask me, trying to make love to everyone.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Durarara is like Baccano! if Baccano! was a complete mess of tropes and loosely strung-together subplots. Do you see how I used exclamation points for Baccano! and not Durarara? That\u2019s because my excitement for Durarara is at least two exclamation points less than it deserves. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m all about the street gangs and the ambiguously omnipresent god character, but I just can\u2019t bring myself to be sexually attracted to a headless woman. It\u2019s a shame because Celty, the punk biker girl, is super hot from the neck down. When she was first introduced, I was like \u201choly boobies this is getting spicy\u201dand I was really excited because the show was mind-numbingly boring up to that point. Much to my dismay, Celty was revealed to have no head and thus no cute anime girl features for my viewing pleasure. It\u2019s like they were trying to teach me about how anime creates unrealistic portrayals of women and how I shouldn\u2019t use it as a reference for actual people. You know, all women should be respected for what they are, blah blah blah. Just this once I wanted a sexy vigilante in a catsuit and they give me this headless weirdo with daddy issues. Yeah, she\u2019s got a nice body, but what is she like in bed with no face? But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself a little here. Let\u2019s talk about the other characters. Oh wait, I can barely remember them because of how bland and inconsequential they were. Durarara (no exclamation point) does a horrible job of balancing the focus of all the characters and bringing their individual motivations to a satisfying climax. I think the outlines of their stories and backgrounds would work well on their own and with the impressive production quality of this show, but written together they don\u2019t give you enough time to breathe let alone become immersed. Also, to nitpick more, Durara (minus one \u201cra\u201d for disappointment) uses quick text messages for all of their exposition and it was such a pain to understand. I\u2019m not Japanese, alright? I watch all anime subbed but the only phrase I know is \u201cit\u2019s stirring up my insides\u201d. I doubt even the ultra-weebs could fully understand the texts anyway. If I wanted to pause the screen every episode to read the translations I would have just bought the manga. \\n\\n\r\n7/10 for nice Celty fan-service but 5/10 for physically restricting headpats.",

            "content": "This is my first review on this site so I apologise if my review doesn't inform you fully about whether you should really watch this highly rated show or not. Also I have to say that I am biased and will be much harsher than possibly other reviewers as I have watched Baccano! which was created by the same people and was told in about the same manner.\r\n If you have already watched Baccano! you might be wondering whether you should watch Durarara!! and that will depend on what you enjoyed in Baccano! If you enjoyed the sheer violence(present only when necessary) that was therein Baccano! and the craziness of characters such as Rail Tracer and Ladd and the comedic relief provided by the couple Isaac and Miria then prepare yourself to be disappointed immensely. For me Durarara!! seemed to be a show made to cater to a much younger age group. Gone was the violence and the craziness replaced with high school kids who really did not develop much and also characters who remained static and comedic characters who just weren't funny. Even the romance present in Durarara!! seemed to be inferior and somewhat cliche to what was presented in Baccano!. So for me personally Baccano! was a much more superior anime than Durarara!! and I just had to make comparisons between the two since I know that many fans of Baccano! will look to watch Durarara!! just like I did.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good enough for me and I found really nothing wrong with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters remained static and were dissapointing, it felt so repititive to see Shizuo do the same thing so many times, shouting Izaya all the time and throwing vending machines and what not at people so many many times and I can see how it might appeal to fangirls when you see one guy obsessed to such an extent with another but it did not appeal to me at all. Anri and Selty was also a dissapointment and they were the main female characters in the show. Selty's love for Shinra felt so clihce to me, gone was the exciting romance that was present in Baccano! replaced with romance that felt like it was taken out of a shoujo manga. Anri constantly drowned herself in a pool of misery and lack of self esteem, Mikado even with the secrets that were revealed about him seemed to be a typical shounen protagonist with self doubts and in love with a girl who he is too cowardly to confess to. It was so evident that Durrarara was made to cater to a younger age when you see these kinds of characters and circumstances. The only two characters that really seemed alright was Izaya and Kida. The romantic relationship between Yagiri and Mika was also refreshing as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI really did not enjoy this show that much but I believe that for people who have not watched baccano! this show might appeal to them much more but for me who has watched Baccano! this show was not enjoyable at all and quite disappointing. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Brain's Base Studios has done it again.\r\nThe real reason I started to watch it, was because it was made by the same people who made Baccano! (my favorite anime). Other wise, that simple overview looks very unappealing\r\nWell lets get right into it shall we?\r\nFirst off, since the anime is still airing I can't accurately judge the storyline. However, 5 episodes have been released and they've looked great so far. The storyline looks cliche and boring at first, but trust me, it does get better.\r\nAnyways, on to the art. This is what really catches everyone's attention. It's so amazingly smooth. They focus in on just theright times and everything is so expertly done that even if you had a bad storyline it would still be entertaining to watch. That's just how good it is. I could explain every detail about it's dynamics, but it's much more enjoyable if you just see it for yourself\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound. I can't say I was as impressed as I was with their last project, but they set the bar pretty high for themselves. It fits in with each scene nicely, but sometimes I find myself wanting something more than what they're giving. However, it's nothing to stress over and doesn't ruin the series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the hard part... characters. If I gave a review watching only the first 3 episode I'd most definitely give them a 4/10. However, these latest episodes really impressed me. They started to focus in on their second protagonist (headless girl), and realistically portrayed her. The boy however is a bit cliche, but can surprise you sometimes by how in-depth it gets into him. But what the producers did so well last time (in Baccano!) did again this time, made amazing supporting characters. They out shine the main characters, which doesn't bother me, because you see them a lot anyways.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole anime is expertly done. It has just the right amount of comedy, tragedy, and drama to make all the themes flow seamlessly together. It's one of those animes that's hard to find a person who won't like it (although some people might be neutral). I'm not saying it's the best out there, but it's a must watch either way.",

            "content": "When this first aired a few years ago on Adult Swim\u2019s Saturday Anime block, I will be the first guy in the room to admit that I wasn\u2019t too interested in it. I originally thought it was boring and had nothing for it, but then again, I was a sour pissant back then. However, a few days ago, I decided that I needed a good few days of anime to watch, so I gave it another go and boy I couldn\u2019t have been more surprised in my life. There has been no anime aside from Fullmetal Alchemist that has got my attention from the veryget-go. I don\u2019t know if it was the story, the OP\u2019s or the ost that made its way into the series. It just all came together and was well-crafted.\\n\\n\r\nI will talk about the story itself cause I feel that deserves some credit. It took me a while to get onto what exactly was happening cause there were bits that went forward, flashbacked, and just pretty much went back-and-forth. It sort of reminded me of the American Dramedy, How I Met Your Mother, where it was told in flashbacks and flashforwards. I will admit that it took at least three episodes for me to get the groove of it, but once you stick around for that long, I will be the first one to tell you that it did not disappoint. It was a well-crafted, well-paced story that will have you begging for more.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound had a certain zing to it. I don\u2019t know how exactly I can explain it, but the two went hand-in-hand with each other. With the almost jazzy-esque sounds for the dramatic moments to the soothing piano to the more emotional moments, the music definitely gave it a great atmosphere. I also have to give major props to the voice acting. I only watched the dub version, so I don\u2019t know how the subbed/original did in comparison, but in my opinion, the dub was pretty spot on. I will actually go on record and state that it was one of my favorite dubs out there. Of course, that\u2019s not counting Future Diary or High School DxD.\\n\\n\r\nThe highest point of the series was definitely the vast array of characters that the series had. We had almost every types out there. It ranged from classic shounen-types to the shy main character, to overbearing husbandos to over-the-top angry males. I mean seriously, the characters had such a different personality in each of them, I was so surprised at how well-balanced each of them seemed to mesh with the seires\u2019 over-the-top atmosphere. Some of my favorite moments definitely came with the main characters were interacting with the supporting characters. Also, the way that each character had their own story but seemed to find a nice balance as to not overshadow the other characters, well it was well done.\\n\\n\r\nSo, at the end of this review, what have we learned? Durarara is an over-the-top, almost barbaric series with even more over-the-top, and barbaric moments, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s one of those series\u2019 that you just have to watch and experience first hand.  It\u2019s one hell of a ride full of moments that will make you laugh out loud and reach for the nearest tissue.",

Almost every episode was left on a cliff hanger and the characters that were developed were developed well.\r\nThat being said there were a lot of characters that were not properly developed as I would have hoped, and there was also some parts that were dragged out longer than they should be. If you like an anime that is consistent and to the point, this is not the one for you. Drrr plays through its episodes in a way that is different then most animes (or at least the ones Ihave seen) where it will show you the exact same thing you just watched the episode before, but from another's point of view. So sometimes instead of continuing on with the story you are getting a little more information on what you just saw. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I liked this anime for the unique way it was played out and the sudden plot twists.",

            "content": "Growing up in the country, moving to the big city can be an enormous change. Especially in a metropolis like Tokyo, in the Ikebukuro district to be precise; with its many people, it can be an overwhelming encounter. In this city, anything can happen and every experience will change certain people in various ways, and still the city will never change.\r\nThis is the second time I watched Durarara!! and in honor of the second season (finally after 5 years!!!), I'm going to review this anime. Once more it was an amazing experience to watch DRRR!!. I\u2019ll never get tired of rewatching this show over andover and here I'll tell you why!\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 8/10\\n\r\nWatching Durarara!! is like a puzzle, with its pieces well shaken on the board. The themes of Durarara!! involve things like supernatural phenomena, an imminent gang war and more dark secrets. Those themes aren't new at all, but the way this show deals with them will leave you amazed. The story is basically built on the background stories of the various characters we'll get to meet, which don't seem to have any connection to eachother at first. Many questions rise, and this way we're immediatly hooked on this show. Every episode is narrated by a different character and from their viewpoints you'll get to see their stories. Each of these characters are unique and are amazing in their own way, but I'll get to them later.\\n\\n\r\nThe first part of DRRR!! starts off with Ryuugamine Mikado moving from the country to Tokyo, encouraged by his longing for a more exciting life and by his best friend. He seems kind of lost when he arrives at the trainstation, but thankfully this best friend Kida Masaomi comes to pick him up. He gives Mikado a tour through Ikabukuro and along with them we meet some of the people that will play an important role in the show; the legendary Headless Rider, an underground doctor, a grand but peace-loving Russian sushi seller and two dangerous men who you really don't want to piss off! In highschool they befriend a quiet, mysterious girl named Sonohara Anri. With each introduced character, we also meet a set of problems and events right of the bat. From the start, this show is packed with action, laughs, mysteries, weird events and even seems a bit chaotic. Ikebukuro obviously won't go easy on newcomers like Mikado and on us as well.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second part of DRRR!!, we'll start to dig deeper into the show's stories, through the viewpoints of the various individuals we get more information on the events and eventually problems get solved and some of our questions will be answered....and slowly the stories intertwine. The storywriters did an excellent job to convey so many content without rushing it nor dragging it too much. With each episode it digs deeper into the mysteries and everything will be explained in great detail. Yet, some of the questions from the beginning keep unanswered. The show leaves us with plotholes and that's pretty frustrating when it's been so good so far. It's probably my only complaint about this show.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 10/10\\n\r\nRyuugamine Mikado, Kida Masaomi, Sonohara Anri, Heiwajima Shizuo, Orihara Izaya, Celty Sturluson... even if you haven't watched this show yet, you might have heard of these names. These are just a couple of this show's many characters. You'll have a lot to choose from and some you'll like more than others, but they're all unique and likeable in their own way. Like mentioned before, in each episode one of them narrate the story. This way you'll get to know more about the characters; their thoughts, backgrounds and experiences. You can imagine how uneasy and yet excited Mikado is in this amazing city like when he sees the legendary Headless Rider the first time, the lively and flirty Masaomi will certainly make you laugh, as well as the constant fights between Izaya and Shizuo. I love them. I love Celty. And I love Simon, I wish I could taste his Russian sushi! The most intriguing of all is that all characters have their own secrets and although there's not a lot of character development in this show, it still explores them far enough to get the best out of them. The most important character in this show however, is one that isn't really a character but it certainly plays a major role throughout the show...it's the city itself! Ikebukuro is a place that lives and breathes. It has a great influence on the story and it's characters. And don't forget the Dollars!\\n\\n\r\nART 8/10\\n\r\nThe character designs and artstyle is typical shounen, but it stands out because of its smooth animation. I couldn't find any flaws in it, or they were so small that I didn't notice. And that's good enough for me! The show conveys the atmosphere of the city, often set during nighttime, perfectly with dark colors and city lights.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 9/10\\n\r\nThe impressive narrating of this show comes with amazing voice acting, along with a memorable soundtrack that fits with every moment of the show. The upbeat opening of the first season has become one of my favorite openings, it makes you excited for what is about to come. The second opening feels more serious, as well as more melancholic, but still catchy and sets the mood. Both the endings are less impressive and feel underwhelming compared to the openings, but they still fit very well with the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT & OVERALL CONCLUSION 10/10\\n\r\nIt's hard to judge an anime when it's already been a favorite for years. Durarara!! certainly isn't a perfect show. Especially towards the end we're left with some loose ends and to be honest, being left with unanswered questions for five years is far to long. Nonetheless it's one of the best anime I've seen so far and it didn't change after watching it a second time. From episode to episode it was an unforgettable, exciting ride.",

People are either charming or tedious.\u201d \u2014Oscar Wilde, Lady Windermere's Fan(favorite quote of Izaya Orihara)\r\nI decide to watch Durarara! Just because of the voice cast and that was totally worth it.how? This review will try to explain that.\r\nStory[9/10]-Durarara starts really slow to thoroughly introduce characters.but once that is over, all the mysteries that were introduced during the character introduction are revealed slowly making the story really intrigue.the pace then becomes perfect.\r\nArt[8/10]-Art of DRRR! Is good, the depiction of busy city is accurate, and the character design is just awesome.\r\nSound[10/10]-Perfect just Perfect. ManI want to give voice acting and soundtrack each 10 of its own. The voice acting just brings the character really to live.whether it be kamoya hiroshi as Izaya saying'I love human' or Miyuki Sawashiro as Celty saying 'traffic cops are scary'.every single character even the supporting ones are brought to life by their respective seiyuus.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd Now towards the Soundtrack. It is composed by the same composer of as Natsume's book of friends. The Ost is as great as of Natsume but I could not believe it was the same guy as Durarara's music sounds so modern when compared to of Natsume.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters[Infinite/10]- Durarara has one of the best character cast I have seen in anise. I did not felt neutral about a single character.whether It be the Main Cast or supporting all were interesting and loving.and I can go into details about every character but that would ruin you fun of watching Durarara!. As DRRR! Is all about the characters.without these characters Durarara is nothing. My favorite character is Izaya Orihara.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment[9/10]- As I have already said I loved every single character of the show.

            "content": "In depth review #8 - Durarara!!\r\nDurarara was definitely an interesting anime to experience. The plot, the writing, and the characters contributed to this, but this feeling mostly came from the fact that Durarara fell inside its own genre. This show was made by Ryogo Narita who is responsible for creating Baccano in 2007. Both of these anime really can\u2019t be compared to anything (besides each other) since both of these anime created their foundations from the ground up. The only way to interrupt these shows from the perspective of someone who hasn\u2019t watched either would be to dissect their names. Baccano is an Italian wordfor noise, or rowdiness; the perfect way to generalize that anime. Durarara is similar to that by being the Japanese onomatopoeia for \u201cvroom vroom\u201d; the sound a motorcycle makes when being revved up, and that\u2019s the best way to describe Durarara. It\u2019s an anime that builds up its energy with each consecutive episode until the story kicks up its brakes up, and let loose. I thought this was a unique way to convey an anime\u2019s story, but this made the first couple of episodes a tad slow. After all the \u201cvroom vrooms\u201d were done though (during episode 11) this show turned into one of the most enjoyable anime I have watched in a while. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.5 (Very Good)\\n\\n\r\nDurarara is an anime about the interesting inhabitants of Ikebukuro, an urban Japanese city that always has something interesting going on within it. The people that make up Durarara\u2019s large cast is the main focus of the story, and are the people who contribute to making the main conflict of the show. The revelation of what Durarara is truly about is slowly revealed as the story continues. However, the story introduces itself by telling the story of a headless dullahan that rides a jet black motorcycle, following the lives of the most dangerous people in the city, giving the viewers the perspective of three high school freshman in the city, and revealing bits of information about a mysterious online gang called the dollars. With each passing episode, more and more people are introduced, and more of these obscure plot device pop up. With time though, all of these interrelated instances comes together and makes up the overall main story of the show. It may seem like Durarara is some sort of weird mashup of random people\u2019s lives, but it isn\u2019t. Everyone plays a role in a bigger scheme that takes place in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n Moving away from the synopsis, the feeling you get when watching Durarara is kind of mixed. Durarara at times can be a bit of a dark anime. There are subtle tints of supernatural aspects, suicide, guilt, manipulation, murder, and gang violence in this show, all of which contribute to the anime\u2019s story heavily. However, Durarara cancels most of this out with a lot of comedic relief, and slice of life tropes. It should be said that Durarara is a very funny anime and does a good job at balancing the two extremes. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.75 (Good)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, it was very distinguishable. It has that style that you can glance at, and instantly know its Durarara. The art overall was ok, but a large part of time that went into it was focused on the atmosphere. The setting, the backgrounds, and the city were nicely animation. It looked like what I would think a modern day ikebukuro would look like honestly. It also made the show livelier from either the color pallet, or how much was on screen at one time. The detail for the characters in the show was ok. There\u2019s nothing to say about the main characters designs but what caught my attention was the background characters. These people are represented as greyed-out humanoid. The people void of color are those who aren\u2019t essential to the plot and story. I just thought it was a cool way to distinguish the important characters from the masses. This became apparent in certain scene where the main characters are in the midst of a crowd. This was cool, and I understand the purpose of it, but it not something I would say, \u201cWow, this is nicely animated\u201d. Certain scene stood of from the rest like the scenes that involved the small supernatural aspects this show has, and the fight scenes, but everything else was average. Overall, the animation was good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 (Great)\\n\\n\r\nMan, I haven\u2019t heard such a great soundtrack like Durarara\u2019s in a while. Even if this review somehow doesn\u2019t convince you to watch Durarara at least listen to the amazing OST. What a piece of art. Not only is the OST riddled with those soft jazzy mixes that made me fall in love with Baccano, but it also has those mellow down-tempo bass music, and piano solos that were amazing. My favorite songs from the OST are \u201cIkebukuro West Exit Five-way Intersection\u201d and \u201cButterfly by ON/OFF\u201d. As for the placement of these songs in the anime \u2013 they were very memorable, and made the scenes they complemented what they were. I remember thinking to myself while watching some the scenes was how amazing the background music was. Its soundtrack germinated so much energy for the anime as a whole, and made it feel more alive. The actions scenes had those intense drum solo segments behind it, the eerie supernatural events had those suspenseful tracks, and the lighthearted scenes had the smooth unimpressionable music behind it. Everything just had a place. The team who made this OST did a great job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5 (Very Good)\\n\\n\r\nThe entirely of this show can honestly be judged by how interesting the characters are. This show thrives off the back stories, and actions of these characters since the story is all about them. The more interesting, funny, or cool they are, the better the show will ultimately be. Durarara, for the most part, nailed this. Most of the characters in this 20+ cast were all interesting. I wanted to see more of them on screen, and dwell into their lives more often. This is especially true for the Izaya, and Shizuo who in my opinion should have been the main characters. Even Certy, and Kyuohei\u2019s posse was something I wished we saw more of. Instead, we got to follow the three uninteresting high-school freshman, Kida, Mikada, and Anri. Mikada, and Anri were dull, and boring characters. Their back stories were epic all hell, but their lackluster personalities were too shitty to make me care. The only salvageable main character was Kida, but he as well didn\u2019t come close to being as interesting as the other supporting main characters in this show. Like seriously, there is a girl who rides a horse that transformed into a motorcycle who is also headless, and she is a supporting main, lol. This was a big letdown in my eyes. Despite this, I do have to give credit to Durarara for making so many interesting characters for this show. Even though they weren\u2019t the main characters, it seemed that every one of them were on screen for a more than reasonable amount of time. Compared to other anime that have casts, Durarara made sure to make these characters relevant to the story, and to give them all their own unique personalities. This was yet another aspect of the show that made everything more realistic and lively. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (Great)\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll just come out and say it. I absolutely loved this anime. It was one of the most enjoyable anime I\u2019ve watched in a while. There were things that I would have had changed but the overall feeling I got from this anime was the best. I would say most of my enjoyment stems for 3 major components. The story, the characters, and the references from other anime. I voiced my opinion on the story, and characters above, but the references was the icing on the cake. There had to be a least a dozen references from other anime in this show, while the most notable ones being from Baccano. This is why I would highly recommend watching the anime Baccano before watching this series. One of my favorite scenes in the show was a cameo from Baccano, and I thought it was amazing when I first saw it. Also, the familiarity you get from watching the openings, and listening the jazzy music in the background adds a unique layer to the overall feeling of Durarara that people who didn\u2019t watch it wouldn\u2019t understand. Durarara was definitely a motorcycle ride of an anime, and I\u2019m thinking of watching it again soon.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8.55/10 (Very Good) - You'll wish your life was this interesting :D \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ryugamine Mikado, Masaomi Kida, Sonohara Anri - three highschool friends, each with secrets and something to do with the urban legends flying around in the normal yet extraordinary city of Ikebukuro.\r\n\tMy first impression for this anime is \"sounds cool, even with the strange name.\" Fortunately, I am not mistaken. The animation style, plot, story progress, characters - all refreshing and amazing. Though this anime's name still remains as a mystery to me. I'm too lazy to do some research.\r\n\tI really love the plot and style of animating the series. Every episodes have different POVs, making the story clearer. Of course that also brought up somecomplaining like \"Aww man, can't you realize it already?\" and \"Don't be such an idiot!\" but I guess that sort of thing is just normal. The thing that makes it cooler is the overlapping of events. Also, the use and role of technology in the series made it more awesome.\\n\\n\r\n\tMy classmates didn't like the distinction of colors e.g. the color of the crowd is gray while the known and focused characters are fully colored at some scenes, but I think it actually made the anime cooler as it matches up pretty perfect for the series. It also helped in concentration and determining the focus of the viewers.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe character designs and attitudes - ohmygod! They are so great! Well the main character is the same old \"kind type\" (you know, every shounen is like that, helping everyone out) but his acting like he didn't know about the Dollars to gather opinions of the others is just so refreshing. It made me start to think that he's pretty cool too. Anyway, the whole set of characters in this anime despite the fact that their featured personality is already common and have been seen for a lot of times not only in the world of anime & manga but as well as other literature pieces. Violent, wicked, helpful, innocent, victim, hero, etc. - all matched up perfectly together. In addition to that, I also liked the art style.\\n\\n\r\n\tHmm, my favorite character? That has to be Orihara Izaya. Why? His weapon is a knife. 'Nuff said.\\n\\n\r\n\tNo, really. He's very cute when he teases Shizuo. I'm really attracted with that smirk on his face whenever he sees Shizuo. His attitude and personality is cool too. Besides, he is an information broker. I actually want to be one someday too :) Anyways, I also liked Shinra Kishitani. I like his attitude - getting all excited when it comes to Celty and showing her his love. And he's a doctor.\\n\\n\r\n\tMoving on...\\n\\n\r\n\tEven the opening and ending theme songs are great. The animations for the opening are really amazing, and the important characters are introduced there too. Well, I won't say that I especially like the animation for the ending songs, but I do love both songs and all the 4 songs are rightful additions to my playlist.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe only complaint in this anime is Izaya did not have his own episode, or the episode with his POV. Anyways, I think it's pretty okay already, since there's always a glimpse of what he's doing every episodes.\\n\\n\r\n\tI love Durarara and I would re-watch it whenever I'm bored and have time. It is a masterpiece, so I rate it a perfect 10.",

            "content": "Durarara!! is pretty addicting urban legend suspense stuff. It intimidates at first by having such a large cast, but each and every one of the characters is cool in a modern, hip way and also not at all complex, making them both easy to digest and to quickly like. This works in its favor for the most part, because Ikebukuro is not only the setting for Durarara!!, it is also essentially the story and the main character. So, the show presents the city to you in pieces, specifically, the cast, whose stories mingle, collide, and combine in an interesting and exciting fashion, but it eventuallyloses itself in the struggles of only a few, when the beauty lies in its many. This review contains spoilers, so heads up.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the large cast, we can start with a single character. If I had to choose one character who does a good job embodying these ideas, it would be, beyond a doubt, Orihara Izaya. Izaya spends the entirety of the show manipulating the people around him. His troublesome presence is known to every single character in the show, so his reach clearly goes far and his actions connect him in one way or another to everyone else. This works in small ways - Izaya gave Kyohei the nickname he hates - as well as larger ones - Izaya enables Namie's control over her brother and the situation that implies. He works creating chaos in the shadows just as often as he parades around on the street causing trouble. This succeeds in multiple ways. First of all, it makes it completely believable that he would have enough intel to work as an information broker of sorts. It also keeps him as a looming, tangible threat that is always looming in any given situation. And, despite this great power he seems to wield, he is pretty grounded as yet another person, yet another player in the big game, albeit the one who is best suited to manage such a hub of life. This makes him a great villain who really takes full advantage of his role, but he also embodies the ideas that hold Durarara!! together as a narrative - the meaning and consequences of a large, intertwined series of relationships.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the show opens up is with this premise close to heart. The first character we are introduced to is  Mikado, who is the new kid in town - he knows next to nothing about the city, so he spends the episode learning about it. Who does the teaching? Well, none other than an old friend of his, Kida, who has definitely been changed significantly by living here. In fact, that's how we are introduced to him - not by who he is, but how he definitely isn't the same after living in Ikebukuro. The unique experience of living in Ikebukuro is expressed in the episode through everything that occurs. The color gangs can be seen loitering in the background, Simon's unique personality accidentally intimidates and confuses Mikado, and of course the more experienced Kida is able to control the situation. Even characters themselves are established as parts of Ikebukuro before people - Mikado sees and hears Shizuo's rampage and sees Celty with his own eyes but as the resident urban legend-turned-real and not as a person. And the episode goes on like that, moving from set piece to set piece really characterizing nothing except for the city itself. It happens in the second episode, but when Izaya is taunting Kamichika as she contemplates suicide, the strongest imagery given in the entire episode is the blood stain on the ground - a permanent fixture of Ikebukuro, forever marking more pieces of the wide and untold story of the town.\\n\\n\r\nIkebukuro itself, though, is a smaller, mostly self-contained way for the show to express information culture, and Durarara!! takes full advantage of that, too. Rumors, for example, are a huge, common way for the plot to move and for characters to learn about their surroundings, such as the Headless Rider and the Dollars. Technology, therefore, works in Durarara!! as both a stylistic choice and as an extension of its theme. Having more information leads to secrets becoming even more important: Kamichika finds out about her father's cheating, Mikado doesn't know Kida was the leader of the Yellow Scarves (and vice-versa for the Dollars), Seiji doesn't know that his sister is lying to him about where Celty's head is, and so on. Izaya as a villain works simply by relaying and manipulating information to cause chaos. The characters talk and exchange information on the internet with each other, most of the time not even knowing that they know each other outside of the internet, creating both an interesting dynamic between them and giving them each yet another persona to adopt. This, by the way, is the coolest part about combining both the setting of a single city and the plot device of gangs - the characters can use technology to interact without knowing it, and it isn't at all far fetched that they just happen to all know each other one way or another because the Dollars as seen in the show are exclusively an Ikebukuro \"gang\".\\n\\n\r\nWhat all this means for the characters is that keeping them simple is very much an effective choice. If they tried to have too much complexity, they would stop being pieces to manipulate and instead become the story itself, and the show would lose focus. For the most part, Durarara!! avoids making this mistake. Instead, they are each crafted to be natural elements of their environment that don't need much explaining to believe. We learn about their pasts, but this is used to explain how living in Ikebukuro has affected them, which is completely in-theme with the rest of the show since Durarara!! wants to paint Ikebukuro and contemporary culture as being a powerful, unique experience, and that no one who experiences it stays the same, for better or worse.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this isn't to say that they aren't entertaining in their own right. The stories and drama that holds Ikebukuro together are, after all, caused by the clashes and conflicts of the characters. On top of that, television is a serial medium tends to find success by offering characters and situations that draw in the viewer and give them a reason to come back for more. Durarara!!'s quickfire style of introducing characters and establishing their personalities and roles to the viewer works very much in favor of capturing the viewer's attention. The thing that really captures the viewer, making Durarara!! a truly addictive show, is how it never lets your first impressions match reality. In other words, a character's immediately apparent traits are met equally with the growing sense of suspense that come with the secrets you know they have.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of secrets works wonderfully in how the show manages to successfully pull off suspense and surprise. Successful suspense doesn't work by trying to set things up and eventually reveal them to be true, which is where a lot of stories go wrong. The viewer is aware enough to put the pieces together themselves and so they won't be surprised when it turns out that they were right. It just isn't a satisfactory experience when so much time is wasted on a surprise you saw coming from a mile away. One of the real tricks to suspense is for the writer to understand this, though - the viewer isn't stupid. They put things together for themselves long before you can surprise them. This leads to some solutions to the problem, some good, some bad. Here's a good solution: trick the viewer into thinking they have all the answers and pull the rug at the last moment. You meet Celty - she doesn't have a head. Very quickly after that, you meet Mika, who mysteriously has a scar lining her neck. A bit later, you find out that Celty is in Ikebukuro because she can sense that her head is there. Mika has Celty's head. The show gives you just enough information to draw your own, completely logical conclusions about the way things are, but the funny thing about information is, you can't really ever have enough of it.\\n\\n\r\nMika never lost her head. It isn't Celty's. You've been onboard Izaya's ruse cruise all along. On top of this, the viewer is rewarded with more information about other plot points and is in general satisfied by their reward for all that build up. Even if you somehow aren't surprised by this reveal it is still creative and uses the plot elements built up to it very efficiently. It's a good moment and shows understanding of the relationship between the viewer and the creator. Durarara!! has a good amount of that relationship attention, too.\\n\\n\r\nBy this point, the choice to only give detail to the foreground characters is something the viewer is very aware of. It is noticeable in almost every scene, after all. Using that as a launching pad, director Omori Takahiro's understanding of the style and ideas behind Durarara!! is really shown off. Throughout the entire show, background characters are portrayed as grey silhouettes for the most part. This, of course, plays the role it always does when used well - it saves some time and money, keeps the visuals uniform, and guarantees focus on the foreground characters. But in the scene in question, when Mikado raises his phone and sends the mass text to the Dollars, the grayed out characters fill out a few at a time in a wave of color, getting the message across without a word: from a plot sense, everyone is in the Dollars, the Dollars are actually Ikebukuro itself, but also, the main characters aren't special in their secret keeping and information lifestyle. It almost makes up for episode 2 being the only other episode where that idea is given the time of day, too.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Omori, his sense of timing in this show combined with Yoshimori Makoto's excellent soundtrack makes for some very stylish and striking moments, and it is easy to see why this show is so easy to love in that sense.\\n\\n\r\nDurarara!! doesn't stop at the drama in finding useful ways to utilize the characters in getting across its message and style, though. It also gives quite a few characters the chance to narrate episodes, switching characters between and occasionally even during episodes. This is a simple yet effective way of expressing that the whole picture of Ikebukuro can't really be seen by any one individual.  There are some repeats, but all in all most of the major characters get a shot at narrating. It is unfortunate, though, that most of the narrators are omniscient, knowing plenty of information their matching character really shouldn't be privy of, so having different narrators rarely actually changes the way things are seen or interpreted.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately Durarara!!'s most satisfying moments in the last two episodes of the first half are also the point where it drops the ball and seems to lose its grasp on what made it special and fun. This reveal is executed near perfectly and feels as good as it should considering every episode before it was straight build-up without many if any real chances for the viewer to feel the weight of suspense lifted even for a moment. However, the sense of mystery and mystique is abandoned in the second half. The idea of slowly leaking a mix of legitimate and misleading plot points is thrown out in a fashion much like the scene where Izaya burns his board game.\\n\\n\r\nThat board was shown many times and pretty hyped up as eventually meaning something greater than \"the three kinds of games are the three teenagers!\" so literally burning it is pretty symbolic in a bad way. Remember how I mentioned there are a few ways to deal with knowing that your audience is smart enough to play connect the dots with your set pieces? Well, in the second half of the show, Durarara!! loses its edge and the suspense becomes both less interesting and less satisfying. About half of the second part of the show is spend on the Slasher, something that was briefly brought up earlier in the show as yet another anomaly of Ikebukuro. \\n\\n\r\nA good place to start; not a sudden new scenario, yet not enough is known about it to make it uninteresting. The problem lies, of course, in execution. The show spends a lot of time talking about the Slasher, showing her killing and terrorizing citizens, but none of it actually points us to anything else we know except for a vague sense that the person behind the incidents has issues with their parents. And we wouldn't even get this impression if it wasn't thrown at us unceremoniously that the spammer in the Dollars chat room uses a handle that matches the name of the blade the Slasher uses. That leads us to Anri, who is lonely, mysterious, and in general an enigma as far as the viewer is concerned  And we're pretty sure it isn't Kamichika, because while she did have issues with her parents, we got a good look at her daily life before, and she seems to have come to terms with her situation. So the episodes go on and on, eventually leading us to the unsurprising and uncreative reveal of, yes, Anri was the slasher. Not very gratifying from the slow and uninteresting beginning to the whimper of an end.\\n\\n\r\nNow, there is one nice thing this arc includes, which is the subplot of the reporter Shuji Niekawa. He and his story are well crafted to both match the themes of the arc and the style and purpose of Durarara!! itself. His job gives him an excuse to interview the many denizens of Ikebukuro, giving the only real showcase of community and being in the Slasher story that made the first half of the show special. His concerns about his family also provide for useful tone complimenting drama without introducing more than a single character and without deviating from the ongoing plot even an inch. It really works, and I wish there was more of it.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, as the Slasher arc ends, the writer decides there is no way to hide the final reveal of the three teenagers and simply dumps on the viewer the cruel fact that Kida used to be the leader of the Yellow Scarves. Now, to give credit where credit is due, this was actually nicely set up. The early episodes link Kida with the gangs in noticeable ways. Kida has an unnatural hatred for the color gangs, yet he is never truly afraid of them. He has also had a lot of troublesome run-ins with Izaya thanks to his impressionable girlfriend Saki. Also, he is frequently associated with the color yellow. Even the most obvious instance of this, his hair color, isn't a coincidence - upon the reveal of his connection to the Yellow Scarves it is pretty reasonable to look back at his comment about dying his hair since being in Ikebukuro and seeing those things as connected events. \\n\\n\r\nSo, before this reveal, it is pretty easy to come to the conclusion that Kida was once involved with the gangs before Mikado moved to the city. The kicker here comes in his position as the head of an entire gang. This is all good and would have totally worked, but it was missing a pretty important part of suspense - the suspense. Kida's past was given a touch of focus in the Slasher arc via his past with Saki, but it was hardly the focus, meaning that there was not a substantial enough of a tonal buildup to the reveal to make it feel like it meant anything. Really a sad waste, considering the good amount of effort putting into foreshadowing it.\\n\\n\r\nThis problem means that the second half of Durarara!! loses a lot of charm, namely, the excitement that comes with suspense and the satisfactory twists that comes with them. There is no longer the sense that you have to see the next episode to find out more, and also, the atmosphere of Ikebukuro being some grand, dangerous, mysterious place is given way too little focus. The show just plops along slowly and without flair until it finally ends, without fanfare or a solid return to its roots. Even so, the sense that Ikebukuro is a big place filled with charismatic, interesting people meeting and interacting never completely leaves the show, which is why it keeps its charm and keeps the viewer coming back until the very end.",

When I was asked \"what was this anime about\", i really couldnt find out the objective in my head. Unfortunately even on episode 23/24 i couldn't.\r\nArt: 7\r\nEverything was really well made, from the buildings, to the dimplaces around the city. The major flaw was on the protagonists. Except Celty, everyone else was emotionless. I couldnt bring my self out and say \"now that's sadness on his/her eyes\" for example. I think most of the people agree here\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe intro with the flashback from the previous episodes in it was absolutely AMAZING! The chosen songs were perfect and the scenery was really good! but the rest rest of the OST was okey.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nAlmost every character didnt stand on their act and beliefs. They were presented as \"A\" lets say, and their acts were \"B\". If you can't blend with the characters' psycological controversy from the begining then the anime is doomed inside of you.... I tried to prove myself wrong and didnt \"drop it\", casue I was hoping for a climax. Izaya let me down. So did Celty after ....................*SPOILER ALERT*................she found out that her bf knew about her head. That's too unrealistic, unbased, and brings out a huge controversy about the Celty's charactaer and the \"viciousness\" she carried out when she was taking lifes like a shinigami.....................*END OF SPOILER*...................\\n\r\nTo summerise, the characters where too dull and confusing for the plot. They didnt stand up for any belief and they didnt have a purpose. I put a 3/10 because i liked Shizuo and not a 1/10..\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nThere was no climax, there was no anticipation for the next episode and the time i spent on this anime i think has gone to waste, cause it didn't change me inside at all...\\n\\n\r\nIf you really want to pinpoint any flaws on my review and way of thought, i would appreciate it because it would be great to find a reason to like this anime like many peeps do :) :)",

Since the first EP I just cant stop watching it(even though I wanted to drop it) but every EP you watch, it makes you crave for more.. so much that you will just keep clicking the next EP until theres no more time.. \r\nDurara is a very unique anime.. its different and will surprise you in many ways.. its kind of a good thing.. but also a bad thing.. but nevertheless this isa really great anime.. but careful, there will be no turning back once you've watched the first EP.. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8+9+10= 9/10\\n\r\nThe story is unique and the way it is viewed is also unique. The story is about gang wars, web gossips(chats), comedy, dark humors, legends, killing, mysteries and so on and it is set in Tokyo's downtown district of Ikebukuro. Ryuugamine Mikado is main male character, an ordinary person longing for changed for excitement in life. Mikado just moved in Tokyo with the invitation from his friend and on his first day he already witnessed so much but each day as both natural and supernatural events occured his ordinary life begins to change.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nAll I can say is that the art is cool, amazing, refreshing.. Its really great..\\n\r\nThe main characters, supporting ones are cool and great. The colors are also great and is great with the story like on the gangs.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe Opening and ending theme songs are great.. I really enjoy it both 1st season and second season opening and endiing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nAll the characters in Durara different and unique from each other like every day life.. Durara is not only focused on the main character but the other characters as well.. they are viewed through their own eyes like the main character.. Each characters, have their own story, problems, abilities and so on.. and it really great.. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 + 9 = 8/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime.. and seen both good and bad parts to this..

            "content": "**This Review is polished. Please do not bother reading this. **\r\nDRRR Review v2.0 \r\nAll constructive criticisms are welcomed and appreciated. (In fact, please give me some so I can improve, if you have the time.)\r\nWhen something is different, people would either like the difference, or not. Therefore it is really hard to score and give a rating to something that doesn't really follow the general formula of anime, since the score is purely based on people's interpretation. \r\nIn a time when people are bored out of themselves, thinking everything is going to be flat and boring for the rest of their lives, what they needis something great, something like adventure where you don't know what's gonna happen, something worth living for. The world of DRRR!! gives you everything modern young fellows will ever dream of. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, as much as I want to talk about how awesome the plot is, I just cannot. Not because it has a bad story, it just that, it doesn't have a story important enough to begin with. So now the question is, does it need one? My answer is no. \\n\\n\r\nThe story has very intriguing settings and objectives that involves many different characters. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the key of this story's success is the visions.\\n\r\nDo you remember how some animes have excellent first episodes to get people's attention and make people think the show is going to be enjoyable? Durarara!! essentially replays the \"first episode\" about 20 times. Every time the story is retold from different perspectives, making a very straightforward event feels like something that is big and complicated (I'm exaggerating it a bit, but you get my point). The story also uses many different methods to make the events look cool and awesome, such as time skip, time reverse or just show you the ending and gradually tell you what happened before that.\\n\\n\r\nAs what I always believed, truth doesn't matter. What matters is what people believe. The story is not that impressive. but the way they interpreted it, is simply brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are why people would watch this show in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nAlright. So. Who are the main characters again? Um. ah. All of them? \\n\r\nExactly. The characters in this show covers pretty much every cool beings you can find in a city. A founder of a secret society? A founder of an actual gang? A founder of a supernatural gang? A Doctor? A Supernatural being? A info broker? An overpowered street fighter? A Russian Sushi store owner? A bunch of street wanderers? You've got it all~~~ \\n\\n\r\nThe magic here is that all the characters are seamlessly connected to one another and they all have a faction of themselves. Sometimes they work together, sometimes they fight to death. Everything changes like the flow of water, you never know what's going to happen to them next. \\n\\n\r\nNothing more to talk about without spoiling too much really. The characters are very well designed, and they are all affected by the trend of events. \\n\\n\r\nGRAPHIC\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the series is very beautiful. The style of background and characters fit perfectly with the urban, fast, cool theme the story offers. \\n\r\nMy only problem is that since there are so many characters, it is unavoidable that some character's art are quite alike, which confused me about twice during the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also very smooth. The action scenes are very well rendered and the frame rate are flawless. \\n\r\nHOWEVER. They really went a bit cheap when there is no action.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all the graphic carries the story with no problem and they are very well done. (Well, considering the high budget..)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND \\n\\n\r\nThe op and the ed can be summarized with \"WHIHOAHDAADShDHADAKILIADDALAAAA\". Which is awesome. Perfectly urban, perfectly fit. I don't understand what any of the words mean and I don't care. The music alone is enough for me to get excited for the upcoming DRRR adventure. \\n\\n\r\nOST are, I'm not even joking, very well done. When the scene is relaxed (for example the chat room), the music makes it conversation not boring. When the scene is tight and nerve recking, the OST can make you relax and simply enjoy what you are looking at without getting afraid. They do not stand on their own however, since I can't recall and sing them from top of my head (Unlike Code Geass's sound track). \\n\\n\r\nDub. Dub. Dub. Dub. are definitely not as good as the sub. BUT. You can certainly tell that the voice actors are trying very hard to make it entertaining and enjoyable. And I don't feel like dub has reduced any positive experience. So, your choice really, both are good, dub does make your eyes easier if you don't like reading. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT \\n\\n\r\nI loved it. As weird as the story may be, the series does propose and answer some interesting philosophical questions, which is what I love. The main ideas are not deep. But the production does make you feel like it is something worth thinking of. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nDurarara!! in my opinion is a very interesting anime and it certainly deserves its hype for what it is. \\n\r\nIt is an outstanding anime that appeals to contemporary young audience. It successfully earned its place in people's minds, and that's already good enough. \\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

            "content": "The sign of a good anime is that emptiness you feel when it's over. That's what I'm feeling at the moment. This anime has been like a rollercoaster ride, that I want to go faster and faster and never stop.The spine-tingling, heart-pumping feverish excitement that possessed me is now over. Durarara was a heck of a ride.\r\nStory:\r\nThe fast-paced breakneck speed of the anime is what really excited me with this show. The only other show that I think have made me feel like this is probably Code Geass and Death Note. With every episode, a small part of the mystery unravels, and you start seeingthe dots connecting. At times you are just as clueless as the characters, at times you know so much that they don't, and you're practically trying to jump into the screen to tell them. The absolute genius behind the storyline is completely breathtaking, with so many twists and turns it blows your mind away sometimes. The intricate web of networks in a thriving metropolis like Ikebukuro, and how every character is interrelated, and every action has overrreaching consequences, is mindblowing to say the least. With plenty of action, crazy (and I mean CRAZYYYY) characters, and a plot that shakes everything up, Durarara will keep you on the edge of your seat.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm the kind of person who puts story before art, so if the storyline is good, the art doesn't really matter to me much. I think the studio did a good job though, as I could really feel the colours and contrasts that a complicated city like Ikebukuro has, and I love the opening and ending art very much, how they introduced the characters names. I also loved how they would put snippets from the previous ep in the opening song, blending it in very well. \\n\\n\r\nSound: It is no exaggeration for me to say that the OP was the first thing that I fell in love with in Durarara. Both OP songs are fantastic, the first more rock and the second more laidback, with lyrics that suited the anime and the story so well. The ending songs were also brilliant, especially the first one. And this anime had so many amazing seiyuus, it's hard to find a place to start! KAmiya Hiroshi as Izaya, Ono Daisuke as Shizuo, and Miyano Mamoru as Kida and the list goes on! They all did such a fantastic job~\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is the other shining gem in this anime. The cast is immense, but yet you feel like you know each and every one of them. Every character is unique, and have such wonderful developments that I wonder how on earth did they manage to do all that in 24 eps. Izaya especially is a wonderful character, he made me wonder whether I actually love him or hate him, but I think in the end I still love him despite his evilness, just because he's so cunning and epic. And his arch rival, Shizuo is nothing like him, yet just as epic and sooo badass! Say \"flying vending machine\" to any Durarara fan, and they will immediately relate it to Shizuo. The best fighting scenes are any with Shizuo in them, and any episode with him in it will be freaking amazing, trust me. I love you SHIZUO! The three main characters, Mikado, Kida and Anri are all the \"I am not who I seem\" types. Then you have a headless rider, Celty, who turns out to be nowhere near scary and more like an adorable moe girl who sucks at cooking and is scared of aliens and cops. You have a Russian dude who works at a sushi shop, you get a crazy young doctor who is in love with Celty, and a few other important characters (Kadota!!) and you get a crazy mixing pot in Ikebukuro, where crazy things happen with all these crazy people.\\n\\n\r\nOverall....just watch it. My excitement must have made an impression by now. You won't regret it :D\\n\r\nNow when is the second season coming....hurry upppppppp",

            "content": "Durarara! is an amazing anime. Before we get started, I'd like to clarify a few things and that is that i'm not very experienced with writing reviews. Okay, now that we got that out of the way, let's continue. Durarara! is has a setting in Ikebukuro Town, where gangs are very popular and other strange happenings seem to occur very often. I can't say much without accidentally spoiling it, so let's move on from there. Personally, I am in LOVE with anime that has gangs or any sort of real-life (sort of) fighting, Durarara! is kind of that type of anime. If you're worried aboutwatching Durarara! like I did, you really shouldn't. At first glance, to me this seemed sort of silly because of the first episode progressing slowly and talking about this whole \"Headless Rider\" fairy tale thing, and about all the gang wars made it seem like they would contradict each other and ruin the show, but the creators were capable of having put everything into place without many contradictions that spoil the story. So buckle your seat belts, and get ready to start watching. (stupid saying, I know. I apologize)\\n\\n\r\n(If I make a lot of mistakes in this review, I'd appreciate if you could point it out because sometimes I don't think things through and may accidentally contradict myself at some points or maybe not be clear enough when conveying my thoughts about things)\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nComponents : \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory : 8.5\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, at first I was concerned of the story in Durarara!! There were too many things going on at once, so I believed that these wouldn't fit in correctly with one another. Later on I found out that this was actually one of the best parts of this anime, the story and all of the different events that were occurring at the same time made it seem like the town was really alive, and showcasing the cruel reality in this world. Some of the stories were actually quite dark and mature, furthering the excitement if you enjoy psychological anime. The story was one of the main thing had me enjoy Durarara!! to the fullest.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8.0\\n\\n\r\nDurarara! has it's own art-style, the scenery of Ikebukuro Town is magnificent. There are a few flaws about the art in my opinion, at times they decide not to color in unimportant characters as in the characters that are strolling around the street or if there are too many people on screen they leave the blank and gray, in my opinion that seems quite unappealing, of course to some people this is a good thing due to the fact that maybe they are unable of paying attention to several characters ( I don't know too many people that do ) Apart from those flaws, the art in Durarara! is interesting and watchable nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8.3\\n\\n\r\nThe music and soundtracks used in Durarara!! is actually very good! The openings and endings were equally epic, I don't remember one time when I ended up skipping the openings that played. Of course, there are only 2 openings but you sure as hell will enjoy them! The soundtracks fit in with whatever is going on, except they tend to use these soundtracks quite often, sadly they don't have many different soundtracks but they still sound great. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development : 9.5\\n\\n\r\nOh my, the Character Development in Durarara! was simply outstanding. Normally, you'd think that they wouldn't focus too much like this on the characters but this is really what keeps the story progressing so well. This anime is basically carried on by the characters.. Let's start off with saying one thing.... All of the Main Cast have their own dark secrets.. At first, they seemed like innocent and typical highschoolers. They are far more than just highschoolers, you begin to realize this later on into the series.... Now, the main character is Mikado Ryuugamine, the first episode portrays him as an unsure, awkward recluse who really looks like he can find a few more friends. He isn't my favorite character, but later on he begins to mature more as his secrets begin to unravel. The characters also have own unique and interesting events which happened to them, the story of Shizuo or even the story about Celty, each person has had something happened to them before. There are amazing characters which really begin to show how awesome they really are later into this series, such as Masaomi Kida, my personal favorite character. Remember this, most characters aren't who they really appear to be.. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9.0\\n\\n\r\nYou will be completely hooked once you get to the big parts of this show, there are many plot twists and cliffhangers which will have you craving to watch the next episode, there were times at night where I had to go to sleep but I was thinking otherwise because of how suspenseful and amazing this anime got. I love Durarara!. I'm sure that you will too. Near the beginning of the series, I was curious about the stories of each character and wanted to learn more about them, so I continued watching out of curiosity. And then, it got to the amazing, mysterious and suspenseful part of the show which has you on the edge of your seat for the rest of the episode! Just a warning, be very careful as you may get completely addicted to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 9.2\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone who enjoys gang-wars, mystery and suspense! Even if you roll with Romance anime, or Drama this won't be the place for you but even you can find enjoyment out of watching Durarara!! This anime is incredibly well-written and downright beautiful. Go ahead, and give it a try. :)\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! I apologize if this wasn't what you were looking for, I appreciate feedback as writing reviews for the anime that I enjoy is sort of my hobby now. I apologize if it was inconvenient reading my review. \\n\\n\r\n~SatanicAlpha\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "DRRR was my friend's favorite anime, so of course I had to give it a shot. And it did not disappoint! By the second episode I knew I would enjoy it. And, really, one of the great things about it is that each episode improves upon the last. That in particular is really hard to come by.\r\nBefore I talk about the plot, let me just say that, despite these flaws (which aren't so minor as to say \"but these are just little issues I had with it!), the plotlines in this show are really, really enjoyable, and definitely give you deep questions to ponder afterwatching.\\n\r\nThe story was craaazy interesting, mostly because there are so many parts to it. Don't like one character's plotline? Wait two minutes and you'll be on to the next one. But at the same time, the mish-mash of so many plots kind of made it lose its coherency. If you asked me what the plot was, I couldn't tell you, because it can't be put into words. And while that's not necessarily a negative, for me it was a bit, just because it made the show seem a bit messy at times. And while that messiness can keep it interesting, it can also make it hard to get invested in sometimes. I know several people who dropped it because of that. But at least each of the storylines had its own interesting resolution.\\n\r\nBut at the same time, there was a lot that was left unexplained. There's a random magical sword thrown in with no explanation, there's IM conversations that you aren't meant to understand until the n-teenth episode, and don't forget the arbitrary, random piece of Celtic mythology thrown in with ZERO explanation (or much resolution, but I guess/hope that's what the second season is for). These things are put in to give the story substance, but their lack of explanation makes it that much harder to believe.\\n\r\nThe characters are all interesting in their own way, but it's evident that when it came to character writing, the writers went for breadth, not depth. (As is evident by the sheer number of characters.) But that's okay, because it's the character interactions that truly make the character aspect of this show so great.\\n\r\nAlso, let me just say how much I loved the ED/ODs. The first OD in particular is just a truly awesome song, one that transcends anime music stereotypes, and the rest of the songs sound strikingly similar to West Coast music. The art in each of these is also really cool (more props to the first OD), and the art throughout the whole show is also great, particularly with regard to Celty.\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say that it takes a while of watching this show to understand why everyone says it's so genius. And if you ever feel like dropping it, please please please pull through!",

I'll try to write a ''unique'' review of how it would be (or how we would like it to be) if we had a life like the characters of this anime. Please read until the end. Thank you. :) \r\n(Sorry for any grammar mistake)\r\nThere are so many reasons why I love Durarara very much, but the most significant is that this anime is like how I would like my life tobe.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone would love to have an adventure life like they're inside an anime. \\n\r\nEveryone would like to have super powers like Ichigo, Luffy, Naruto, Natsu, Tsuna etc. have.\\n\r\nBut in a second thought, being someone like these characters would mean a tense life. So, this ''dream'' will be abandoned.\\n\\n\r\nDurarara serves a slice of life story in a big crowded city like almost all of us live in one.\\n\r\nThe characters seem to be just ordinary students/citizens with a normal life.\\n\r\nBut that's when the best part comes!\\n\r\nThe characters as ordinary as they may seem, are actually something more than this. Each one of them has a ''dark'' (I'd rather call it unique, instead) personality other than their normal one. Some of them are members of mafia, others are independents, but still very strong. Others are neither mafia members nor do they have insane powers such as super powers or physical powers that not a normal human would ever have, but still play an important role in some cases. This kind of characters usually step into various adventures that we all would like to have. I'm sure that all of you have at least once thought to have a second personality that only you and people that are not in your milieu know (or at least your best friend knows, too) and try to keep it secret. And you're in close call with these people or even fight them if they're ''bad'' guys either directly or indirectly. And to make it more interesting, let's add a bit of supernatural, too. Legends that are known to exist until now that have been seen by some people, but hardly ever, like a headless rider or very rarely humans that have a super power (not as fancy as to have a bankai or to be a rubberman) that makes them like having ''pulled out'' from a movie, and these people are among us, and when the time comes to witness this living legend out of nowhere, even for an instant, makes us feel like being inside a fairytale ourselves.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the life we all dream about to have. Not a life as tense as the most main characters have (like Ichigo, Luffy, Naruto etc as I mentioned before), but still a life that can satisfy us. An ordinary life in big city full of adventures and mysterious events.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the main reason why I love Durarara so much!",

            "content": "You may recognise Narita Ryohgo's name in connection with Baccano, but he wrote one other fairly successful series, Durarara the light novels that sound like the opening of a pep squad cheer. They recieved an adaptation from the same studio that worked on Baccano, Brain's Base. Does it surpass Baccano? Is it worse? Roughly the same? Let's take a look and find out.\r\nOur story begins with a teenager named Ryugamine Mikado moving from his small hometown to the Ikebukuro district in Tokyo in order to attend High school with his old friend, Kida Masaomi. But there's more happening in Ikebukuro than is readily apparent. Thereare rumours of a headless motorcycle rider, human experiments and gang activity and it's all inter-connected. Now, let's start with what the story does badly. At first I thought that I might be dealing with another Katanagatari since the first episode is really heavy with exposition, fortunately the series gets better after that and actually has things happen. The romance has to be my biggest complaint. There are a lot of screwed up romantic relationships. It wouldn't bother me, except that they're portrayed as being positive. I dont mind screwed up relationships, but at least give some acknowledgement that they're screwed up instead of expecting me to believe that they have a great, loving relationship. To be fair there are a couple good romantic relationships, or relationships that lean in that direction, too. Another issue I had is that there are some really repetitive moments. Several of the early episodes cover the exact same information You know, in case you forgot what happened between episodes. Then we have the humour. It's mixed. Some of it is funny some of it falls short. Now, onto the positive aspects. Durarara does a much better job at building suspense and at balancing humour and drama than Baccano did. The story actually is very interesting and finding the connections between two elements that initially seem completely separate can be fascinating. It also has a really good climax, two in fact. One at the end of the first story arc and the other at the end of the second. Yeah, the story of Durarara is really separated into two arcs but I can't really go into details about the second without giving spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nNow we move onto the characters. Durarara has one of the same major issues as Baccano. Some of the characters are really interesting and well developed, but others lack any real depth and are just kind of dull. Some of them get some good scenes, but there's still not much to them. The most notable example is a girl who has an entire episode dedicated to her early on, and is never mentioned again, nor does she do anything. Meaning that the episode focusing on her was largely pointless. I think she has a few background appearances but that really doesn't justify going into her backstory in great detail. The main dividing line seems to be how central the character is to the main plot. Most of the major characters, Masaomi, Mikado, Anri and Izaya, for instance, are interesting. Whereas a lot of the less important characters, Shizuo Shinra, Karisawa and Yumasaki, for example, get very little development. There are some exceptions. Seiji is pretty central to the first arc and he's about as interesting as wet cardboard. \\n\\n\r\nLet's look at the art. Durarara has some odd art choices. There's one I actually really like and that's making most of the extraneous people who only appear moving in the background colourless until they're having some impact on the plot. Normally I would complain about something like that being lazy, but I think the execution actually makes it work. That being said, there are some aspects to the art that I didn't like. The major one is that a lot of the locations look really similar, even when the characters or action are moving through different locales and it makes it tough to get a good sense of place. Another thing that bothers me are all the adverts for other anime. A cameo appearance or two wouldn't bother me, but they really overdo it. Virtually any scene in the heart of Ikebukuro is going to reference at least three other anime and they don't employ much subtlety. They illustrate the signage prominently. That being said, some of the character designs are creative and there is a sense of vibrancy to the backdrops. The action scenes are also well done, for the most part and Durarara has some really good chase scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is another aspect that's kind of mixed. There are some really good performances from people like Kamiya Hiroshi, Sawashiro Miyuki and Hanazawa Kana but there are also some that get pretty grating. Ono Daisuke gives an annoyingly exaggerated performance and the Russian dialogue is really stilted. Yeah, the actors are trying to work with a language they may not know very well or, at best, a second language, but it is a noticeable issue. As for the music, it's okay. It's nothing particularly good but it's functional. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. Yuri is absent from this. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all Durarara is actually pretty good. I did have some issues with it, but I think that the interesting characters make up for those with little in terms of personality and the story does have some strong suspense and the connections between the elements are really well handled. So my final rating is going to be a 7/10. It's a good anime and worth watching. Especially if you're a fan of Narita Ryohgo's work.",

While it does have its fair of engaging characters, such as Celty, Anri, Shizuo, and Izaya, most are a sore disappointment knowing what the mastermind was capable of. \r\nThat namely centers on the cliche trio that spent the entire first half of the anime being, ostensibly, the only sane people observing the insane Ikebukuro. And for what it's worth, I found myself enjoying the show in anticipation right until I was letdown by their actual fruition, which would be about the first 10-13 episodes.\r\nAnd honestly, withlittle to no foreshadowing beforehand in the anime, the first half of the episodes and the second half simply clash too much due to the poor transition between them.\\n\\n\r\nI won't go into further depth because, as the case were, the first half was largely unique to the anime (i.e. not in the light novel Durarara was adapted from).\\n\\n\r\nI'll watch season 2 with no expectations.",

There is character development throughout the season which left me changing my mind about several of the characters. The music is memorable in this series. There are several genres of music played, each of them adding to the experience of the show.\r\nYou might enjoy this if: You want a world of fantasy mixed with reality.\r\nYou might not like it if: Tokyo-inspired gang wars are not your thing.\r\nNote to the Viewer: Durarara!! will surprise you time and time again with its secrets.\r\nEXPANDEDREVIEW FROM SLC ANIME\\n\\n\r\nThe music/soundtrack of the anime was mentioned repeatedly as a positive. The group enjoyed the diversity of the soundtrack and felt that it added to the show. There are some group members that have been to Japan and they noticed that the show was surprisingly accurate when it came to locations. The complexity and depth of the story and characters was another positive aspect of the show. Although there were a lot of characters, there was development for the majority of them, and there was a feeling of investment. The last thing brought up that got a nod from some of the members was the references to other anime that came up throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nThere were mixed reviews about the animation. The background characters were mainly \u201cgrey people\u201d, which were animated in nothing but grey. Some group members liked that, feeling that it helped to focus attention on the main characters. Other members felt that it was cheap to show grey people so often.",

            "content": "From the people who brought you Baccano!, comes another series with a lot of the same ideas and themes told in a unique and different way. The only difference is that it's longer in terms of episodes. But does that mean it's more entertaining then the ridiculously fun show it proceeded from? Let's find out.\r\nThe Story (7/10)\r\nA young boy named Mikado Ry\u016bgamine moves into the real life city of Ikebukuro as an invitation from his childhood friend Masaomi Kida, in order to attend Raira Academy, meeting a shy timid girl, named Anri Sonohara. From there he realizes that the city he moved into isn't assafe as he thought it would. As he comes across some very dangerous and mysterious people. Like a violent man with superhuman strength, an information broker, and a mysterious gang known as \"The Dollars\". But the most abnormal being he comes across is a modern day version of the Headless Horseman called, \"The Headless Rider\". Her names goes by Celty Sturluson, who has a mission to retrieve her stolen head, with the help of a scientist named Shinra Kishitani. Most of the episodes revolve around Masaomi trying to coupe with his new home despite all the dangerous goings on in it, and the mysterious people he meets and learns more about when learning their backstories.\\n\\n\r\nI will say this series does have aspects that makes a good anime. For one it knows when to give a certain character an episode mostly focusing him or her's backstory, as well as knowing the right time to introduce them. Though if there's one thing it suffers from, is that some characters that are more interesting then the main ones, don't get that much screen time. Now I'm not saying the three characters that are considered the main ones bad, they just aren't as interesting as the other characters. But I'll go more into detail later. That and their are some elements of the show that are left unfinished, but I guess that's just the animes way of making you want to read the Light Novels. Instead of adapting the entire source into an anime, they just adapt the first few books as a way of promoting. Giving people a motive to read more. Which....now that I think about it, is actually an ingenius idea.\\n\\n\r\nOnce compared to Baccano!, in my opinion, it doesn't hold that bright a candle to that series. Baccano! just has a much more intriguing way of telling 3 stories simultaneously and manages to end them around the same time in the course of 13 episodes. It tells so much with so little episodes. That and the characters are so much more interesting and fun to watch. Also, while it only adapted the first few books, a lot feels resolved and there are only 1 or 2 loose ends left. Allowing the anime to stand on it's own. Durarara!! does a good job following Baccano!'s foot steps, just not to a point where it's a worthy successor.\\n\\n\r\nThe Dub (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nAniplex is a dubbing company I don't see dubs as much as Funimation, or Bandai. But for what they are, they did good. Like every anime I've seen before, it does have the regulars that I'm use to hearing. Michelle Ruff, Crispin Freeman, Johnny Yong Bosch, Steve Blum, Kari Wahlgren, Stephanie Sheh, the list goes on. I won't go down every voice, but I will talk about the ones that really stand out. I really loved hearing Michelle Ruff as Anri Sonohara, as the voice reminds me of Yuki Nagato's human counterpart. Crispin Freeman was very entertaining as Shizuo Heiwajima, which was the second time I heard him being angry since Haruhi Season 2. Johnny Yong Bosch is the go too guy to play the shady, slimy, and very mysterious character. In this shows case, Izaya Orihara. Kari Wahlgren I didn't recognize when she's voicing Celty. So cudos to her. Steve Blum's voice is always entertaining to hear, even if most of the time it's the same voice. The dubbers make sure they pick the right voices for each individual character, rather then just picking these guys just because of their status' in the industry.\\n\\n\r\nBut there's this one little nitpick I feel like talking about. This isn't that big a spoiler, but Isaac and Miria from Baccano! make an appearance (Which is odd considering their are countless times where the show they came from appears in a big screen in the city.....Paradox?) and since Funimation isn't the one dubbing this series, they got Sam Riegel and Stephanie Sheh to voice them.......and BOY do they sound TERRIBLE! I can tell they were trying.....but not too much. But other then that, it's a good dub. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nLike Baccano!, this series has a gigantic ensemble of characters. So we might be here all day if I explain every single one. So instead, I'll just talk about the major ones and give my brief thoughts on them, and then talk about what they have in common. There's the main character Mikado Ry\u016bgamine, who......is actually the most uninteresting character in the show. In my opinion at least. I mean, there's one interesting thing that he does, but that's it. There's also his childhood friend Masaomi Kida, who kinda reminds me of Tamaki Suoh a bit. In terms of design and personality, but a lot more tone down. Anri Sonohara does seem like your typical shy, timid, big breasted girls you're use to seeing from KyoAni shows, but we learn a lot more about her past.....with some of disturbing aspects to it. There's also this gang lead by Kyohei Kadota, and other members include a guy obsessed with his fan, and two cheerful otaku's who have a fun gimmick of referencing other animes a-la Lucky Star. One of the most entertaining characters is Shizuo Heiwajima. A violent guy dressed as a butler who ironically hates violence, who usually tries to kill a shady smug informant named Izaya Orihara. But their fights usually break up by the black russian sushi shop owner,  Simon Brezhnev.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, there are tons of characters in this series. Though one thing they all share in common is the fact that most of them have their backstories, their inner depth, or are just fun to watch. Though character that I thought really stood out was the headless rider, Celty Sturluson. She was the highlight of this anime for several reasons. Despite having no head, she does manage to have a personality and can be very expressive. Through her body language and her way of communicating. Through texting what she says through an iTouch looking phone. That and her backstory on how she lost her head is actually pretty tragic, which makes you route for the character. She does get assistance from a scientist named Shinra Kishitani. Whose relationship with Celty can take many twists and turns along the way.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a pretty entertaining cast, but it's not as memorable as the one in Baccano! Which gave equal amount of screen time for each character.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nIn tradition, the music revolves around jazzy and blues like music that can be catchy when it wants to be. Not only that, but both opening themes do follow the same format as Baccano's. While the music, it shows every single character and places them in still frames, giving the characters name. The first opening theme \"Trust Me\" is a very catchy song that's very reminiscent of several pop songs from the early 2000's. The visuals are so fun to watch, that you'll find yourself re-watching the end credits. As it features all the characters in some form of tower, where each one carries the other in a funny looking way. The second ending theme \"Butterfly\" really suites the more darker tone of the second half. Which it's visuals have a similar format as Trust Me's, but not as entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nDurarara!! may be the best anime with the stupidest title. Even if it's not on par with it's sister series, it still manages to be fun to watch in it's own right. With it's intriguing ideas, fun characters, and dark atmosphere. I high recommend it to those who really enjoyed Baccano! Just don't expect it to be as good.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "People trying out this anime would, after the first few episodes, shelve this in the very exclusive \"WTF?\" category. At first glance, there's a very inconsistent plotline, and the characters are  easy to segregate - some are fairly generic, and  some are frackin' crazy. A whole lot of mess happens in Ikebukuro - there's color gangs, vending machines and trash bins flipping through the air, a supposedly headless biker? Wow. But this anime is hard to give up. It'is just strange and offbeat and hard to ignore. As the anime progresses, the different stories it's collected thus far comes together, giving us apanoramic view to the DRRR!! universe.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, the animation is nothing to 'wow' over, but I still think it's quite admirable. The style is clean, and gives a realistic take on a surreal plot. I also find the soundtrack pleasing to listen. Certain songs touches upon different genres and instruments, giving it a versatile feel. The songs go well with these bizarre situations.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at some of the previous reviews made about Durarara!! here, I find it hard to believe that people would think, from just the first few episodes, that everyone in the cast is interesting and when it comes to character development, DRRR!! trumps all. Not necessarily true. \\n\r\nSure, some of the characters you see from the start spark a bit of interest - the mysterious Celty, the apathetic Izaya, and the rage-induced Shizuo. And they - as well as many others - gain more depth and complexity as we follow them throughout the show. But some are rather flat and remain so, such as the trio that the show tends to revolve around - Mikado, Kida, and Anri. Despite what characters you may/may not prefer, they all connect with one another, and the viewer gains an equal perspective with every one of them. In a way, Durarara!! samples a window of what life purely is.",

            "content": "Well, Yeah! I gave it a 10/10 I wouldn't say it was completely rational for me to give it a 10, but the entertainment level , the characters and just how they put everything together is just completely amazing! Like Hisashi Sasaki , the editor in Bakuman, said \"as long as the Manga is interesting, people will like it!\" I think this statement is the same for anime.\r\nStory: 8/10 \r\nImagine this: You are nearsighted and you don't have glasses or contacts. You never knew if you are going to get one at all so you start looking at people really closely in order to seetheir details. But one day, someone forcefully puts a pair of glasses on you and now, you not only see the people you want to see, you also remember every detail about them! This is basically how the story of this anime is set up.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is narrated by different characters throughout the story and most of the the first half of the anime is about introducing the main characters through some events they go though and most of these episodes are narrated by the characters themselves. To be honest, even though it took them about 12 episodes to introduce most of the important characters, it is not the most easy-to-understand character introduction and I am sure that is also what makes this anime so interesting. After the first half(not exactly first 12ep. but around there) Hell breaks loose and everything starts to come together. That is all I'm going to say because saying anything becomes a spoiler. \\n\\n\r\nPS: If you like to guess what happens next you will either have no clue about what is happening at all to the extent that you cannot even make a single guess or, if they want you to know, you will get exactly everything right. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nThere is seriously nothing too great about the art itself, but this art style is perfect for Durarara! If someone looks weird, he is supposed to and vise versa. \\n\r\nThe atmospheric feeling of the art is often in somebody's perspective, often expressing what the person is observing at or tries to know about.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe music of the OP and ED is great and what makes it better is the opening animation! The opening also contains a review of some information that is essential to the current episode. I watched and listened to every single OP without skipping a second! It is THAT exciting ^_^\\n\\n\r\nThe sound tracks of Durarara! is an amazing mood creator, sometimes it is really subtle and sometimes it is really strong, but I never found it annoying.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFirst, I would Like you to decide for yourself what makes a character interesting. Maybe it's their past experiences and the things that they've gone through. Perhaps it is their personality.\\n\\n\r\nThere are TONS of main characters in this anime including three high school students, an information seller, an abnormal doctor with a headless rider and a guy who is always in a bartender suit. Connect them, I dare you. One of the most amazing thing about these characters is that they are all connect in some way and through some events but they are not always connected but almost every single one of them effect each other greatly. \\n\\n\r\nAt this point, many would ask about the character development. Well, many of them do change and \"grow up\" through major events but in many cases their personality and their past itself is already interesting enough that I don't think it can get much more interesting. The most interesting characters may not always be the dynamic ones!\\n\\n\r\nNo matter what type of character you are looking for, Cool, Badass, Ambitious and about everything else you would think of. This series truly contains so many interesting characters that I guarantee you will at least find a few, both main and supporting, characters really interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFor me, this is definitely the most important aspect of an anime. The entertainment section is basically the byproduct of every other aspect of an anime working together and the resonance of the story, characters, sound art, of Durarara! is just so great that every moment is fun. \\n\r\nGenerally, this is neither the anime that makes the audience laugh out loud nor cry. Instead, it is able to bring the smile out of an audience while making him constantly think.\\n\r\nI know many people, including me, likes to watch anime/films with a critical mind, but C'mon, I am positive that 99% of you are watching anime for entertainment, so let us try to not let that aspect carry us away. If you are seriously someone who just watches an anime to find out good and bad aspects of the anime, Durarara! will not disappoint you either. And maybe you can tell me the reasons behind Durarara! being so F**king Cool and interesting!\\n\\n\r\nIn general, I would recommend this anime to everyone in both sexes since it is just so unique in style. Trust me, this anime will not disappoint you and watching it will be a fantastic experience\uff01\\n",

            "content": "When I watch a show or play a game, I typically value the characters and the world heavily: All of my favorites excel in either one of these aspects. When I find a show tha excels at both of these aspects, it's pretty much a dead ringer for one of my favorite shows. Today in anticipation for the Season 2, we have a show that pulls this off and because of it, is in my Top 10 anime: Durarara!!\r\nStory + Characters\r\nDurarara!! has a story that tries to do everything, and manages to do everything. Written by Ryohgo Narita (who also did Baccano), it\u2019s a storythat matches expectations you may have and does a bit more: It\u2019s an ensemble cast character drama with romance, pure comedy, supernatural aspects, gang wars, and anything else you can really imagine. The best part? Every one of these aspects is executed pretty well (in my opinion), creating a highly enjoyable show that never gets old no matter how often you watch it. That being said, it's not so much something that's made to blow your mind in how awesome it is, but it's a show that's just so enjoyable and fun that I can't help but love it. It's rare to see a show that focuses on being very entertaining while keeping the quality in other aspects high enough that you truly find an enjoyable show. It's really a recipe of success, and I love it when I find shows like this. (Others that come to mind that is like this is FMA:B, Date A Live, Soul Eater, etc.)\\n\\n\r\nDurarara!! takes place in Tokyo's downtown district of Ikebukuro, an interesting yet dangerous town where many unusual things happen\u2026 you could almost say it\u2019s magical. With cursed blades, headless dulahans, gang wars and people with superhuman strength, it\u2019s a hectic story the story that manages to capture the feeling of the city, which is really what the story is about. What makes the city special though is that feels alive, sprawling, and ever-changing: it feels like a character with it's mind of it's own, a character that changes and develops the whole way through. It's more than just a setting: DRRR!! is the story of this living, changing city and all the absurdity that comes with this which makes it that much more enjoyable.. and I wouldn't have it any other way. The show lets you get to know it's version of Ikebukuro, from the gossip to the gangs and folklore, and it makes you feel like you are truly living in this hectic city. It feels very modern, fast paced and crazy, like a real city should. When Mikado feels nervous because he's in a new town, you feel that too. When people start talking about rumors  It's an amazing atmosphere that is directly attached to the story thus also to the characters and the viewer, and it's something I love.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, DRRR!! has an ensemble cast that is absolutely fantastic, one of the few ensemble casts I actually like: every character is interesting, likable, memorable, unique and fleshed out. The characters are truly the core structure for the story, the fallback when other aspects grow weak or what motivates you to keep watching, it's what the show relies on and it's by far the best aspect of the show. While it's probably the largest ensamble cast I've seen in anime, they manage to make such a large cast feel small because it's done so well that they are all well rounded and enjoyable. The characters get solid development as they have interesting issues that they have to deal with, and the way they struggle through it is admirable, even if not relatable. I could talk to you about how great each of the characters are, but i'd be here for hours just babbling on how mikado is a perfect main character who is very easy to relate to or how awesome celty is as a character and a legend.... yeah... they're great, some of my favorites.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole is greater than the parts though, and it's the interactions they have that is the icing on the cake. The interactions they have with each other is spot on just seeing what they do is very entertaining, and it makes the cast that much better... it's rare that I see a cast that I like as much as DRRR!!. They have an interesting dynamic in the way that they deal with and seeing this dynamic is engaging and interesting. The way DRRR!! balances the motivations and goals between the characters, entwining their thoughts and fate is great, and I loved every bit of it.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the way that DRRR handles the story, the execution is pretty solid. The way they transition between the is pretty great, going through and utilizing the ensamble cast by changing perspectives is something I appreciate. The story isn't exactly a linear story, more like a slog through an onburst of information and rumors, going through what is running through the rumor mill. It's not the neatest plot, but it's a story I aprpeciate because it adds charm and realism, while making it feel episodic at times,a feeling I miss when watching shows as of late. The pacing is pretty solid as well, preventing the show from having a dull moment: it's frenetic at times, lethargic at times, but always natural and entertaining... in a way it's simulating how life is, which is really fitting for the show. I also really appreciate the integration of random aspects of the world like the chatroom and off comment remarks, it's something that adds charm and is a reason why I love DRRR so much.  Durarara is like a window into another world in our modern world (more specifically it's version of Ikebukoro) and it's extremely interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the writing isn't perfect, and there's a lot of people who just don't care too much for Durarara!! because of it. Personally, I never found any issues with the writing that have bothered me while watching the show, but those who have generally have valid complaints and I would be showing a little bit too much of my bias if I didn't take a look at them and consider them.\\n\\n\r\n1) The story isn't really all that clear and can be confusing at times: Yes, plot points do not connect, the writing isn't there to blow your mind, it does have writing issues and it's not really presented in a way that's super clear, but nitpicking that in my opinion goes against the whole meaning of the show. Durarara!! goes with the flow to simulate life a bit in that aspect because it's story of life in a city, but along with that is the hectic confusion that comes with living in a city. considering that this is a show about the lives of people in a city... it isn't supposed to be cleancut. Real lives aren't always tied up in a neat bow.\\n\\n\r\n2) The show focuses too much on the 3 high schoolers (Mikado, Kida and Anri) and at the end of the show, and this is boring to watch, it turns into a \"soap opera\": I saw this complaint several times, but I didn't see it when I watch the show. I really liked because of the personalities they have, the dynamics between their relationship, and the groups they represent.  They may be not as great as others in the cast, but I don't think that's saying bad about them as it's saying how great the rest of of the cast is as in my opinion, these three are well developed and interesting. While they may not be as interesting as other characters in the show, I don't think boring is the right word to describe it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Durarara!! is written in a way that's fun. It may not be the most gripping or amazing narratives, but it's done in a way that will absorb you in and engage you with the events happening in the show.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals\\n\r\nWhile Durarara!! doesn't aim to be the best looking anime, that doesn't necessarily mean it looks bad... in fact, if you ask me, it looks pretty decent. Durarara!! has a great stylized design that really adds to the show: it's modern, it makes things pop, it's very clean in design, and it looks solid, but the animation itself could use a bit of polish. (But honestly, if this bothers you guys, you haven't seen anything ._.) It does the job: it's clean, looks solid in general and tries it's best to not get in the way. Due to the execution, the visuals usually serve to support other aspects of the story moreso than looking nice (It can look pretty great as it sometimes picks up during action scene). It's filled with minor niceties that add flair to the show and make it stand out like the fact that non important people aren't colored (lol), the colored highlights used in the show to make things stand out , the atmospheric tones, and because of these, it can stand out from the rest of the show. Overall though,  it generally keeps a consistent level of quality and that's what matters. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nIf there's one aspect of this show that is universally praised, it's the soundtrack. It's a great soundtrack that is pleasing to the ear, absolutely makes the mood, and has a great personality. It's thrilling, engaging, interesting, unique, awesome, and any other adjectives I can throw at it. Really, it speaks for itself. I just love how it fits with the situation extremely well, as it's modern and there's a huge variety that I appreciate, with a great use of distinct instruments and jazz. Absolutely one of my favorite soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the voice acting... I'm pretty sure that Durarara!! has the best voice acting I've seen in the past few years... both dubbed and subbed. I've originally got into durarara via dub and I prefer that one, but both have A+ talant (Miyano Mamoru, Kana Hanazawa, Miyuki Sawashiro, Jun Fukuyama are some greats for the Japanese, and Crispin Freeman, Johnny Yong Bosh, Steve Blum are some greats for the English) and everyone did a fantastic job. It's a treat for the ears, and it's a joy to listen to. \\n\r\n10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nTake everything I said about it, and it's pretty easy to see what this section is going to be like. I love Durarara!! to no end, it\u2019s one of my favorites, it\u2019s one of the few shows that I rewatch every year, and it's one of the few shows that I can enjoy every time. Durarara!! Is a show that\u2019s geared for your enjoyment, and it satisfies this exceedingly well. It\u2019s an experience that\u2019s loads of fun, a show that is a blast every time I see it. All of the aspects build up to create an experience that feels alive, fells magical and it's something I appreciate. I get completely absorbed when watching it and i'm consistently entertained throughout. The little things that this show does do so much to help my experience with this and I can't help but love it. It's a show with a personality and this personality is something I fell in love with.\\n\r\n10\\n\\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\nDurarara!! is a show that I love to no end. It may have it's flaws, but really in the face of how entertaining it is, I don't find that to be much of an issue, and you shouldn't either. I'm looking to the continuation of one of my favorite shows, and hopefully I'll love it as much as this season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 Polarization +1, -3",

            "content": "Durarara is one of my favorite animes, it was very interesting and kept you going, but the first few episodes are somewhat slow. It speeds up as you keep watching. The anime is about a boy named Mikado Ryuugamine is a high school student who moves to Ikebukuro to attend school with his childhood friend, Kida Masaomi. When Mikado does get there, Kida warns him about the dangers of Ikebukuro, such as an information broker, a headless rider, a man with superhuman strength, and a gang slowly gaining power called the Dollars. The story line may seem dull to people, but it is very interestingand there are plot twists everywhere. It's very suspenseful and catches you off guard. The characters are unique and the anime was very entertaining. The songs may be weird at first, but they turn out to be very catchy and may even get stuck in your head.",

            "content": "I might be a little biased but damn did I love this series. I came across this entirely by chance-- someone was asking for recommendations for something similar to Baccano and aside from the abundant answers of boku no pico, someone recommended a series by the same person, Durarara!! They recommender went as far to say that it was even better than Bacanno if you can ignore the fujoshi shit. I don't think I ever saw Durarara!! come up again for a couple months after that so I guess it was lucky I'd seen it when I did. I tried to get into Baccano butit just wasn't something I was in the mood for at the time so I tried Durarara and easily fell into it.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode did not particularly woo me as much as I had hoped but it was definitely not hard to get into. My immediate allure to the show was actually Izaya and his \"love\" of people. He loved the kinds of reactions people had to just about anything, and while I like to think I am not much of a sadist, I can appreciate the idea. People are interesting creatures. Though I'd read the synopsis, I hoped for a lot more of Izaya and I was not disappointed as he peppered the show, observing and manipulating others acting as an informant and often having street lights thrown at him by an enraged Shizuo, who I was also a fan of but not necessarily paired together. I loved Shizuo's softer moments with Celty.\\n\\n\r\nI'll say this now, I absolutely loved the soundtrack. Both opening themes are a great listen all by themselves and I often find myself youtubing the ost for some nice background music. Some of it is so simple but pretty memorable as being unmistakeably from Durarara!!. \\n\\n\r\nI'd also like to point out, I am utterly surprised as I had watched the subbed version first, but I was thoroughly impressed by Simon's Russian accent in the dub. Out of everyone I was most concerned about his voice and it just so happened he sounded exactly as I imagined. I can remember some dubs going as far as changing the nationalities of characters to warrant a different kind of accent (I swear it was One Piece but don't quote me...) but this was a delightful surprise!\\n\\n\r\nSomething I loved about the characters was it made everyone seem like they were important. If they were shown once, they were always brought up again in a later scenario in unexpected ways. I liked that side characters got a few times to be fleshed out, rather than being a typical filler character that is mentioned once and never again. They may not have been main characters or friends of the main characters but they were still given a role that would tie into another main character's storyline eventually and I have the hugest boner for that kind of shit. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is great and has a lot going on the entire time and I loved the shit out of it because almost all of it was wrapped up in the end. I know I loved it but the producers were not going to kid themselves-- they knew they weren't going to get more than 24 episodes. So instead of leaving open questions or cliffhangers at the end for a possible sequel, it was all wrapped up rather nicely for the most part I think. There's the color wars, the Dollars and their origin, Saika the demon blade, Celty the headless rider searching for her missing head, the human kidnapping, trafficking and experimentation in a secret lab facility, all hidden beneath a cute boys doing gay things facade. And I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nYes, they never wrapped up what on earth was going on with the human experimenting fully, and yes they never went into Izaya's past (and I'm sure a few others) but I felt that everything else was done spot on and honestly, it was enough for me. There was so much going on I hardly noticed. And isn't it fitting that as a man that is in the business of digging up dirt on high profile people that he himself have a low one? Just a thought.",

So you know where this review is heading, right?\r\nStory 9/10\r\nAlthough this season contains the first and largest arc of the Light Novels, it is still formed from smaller stories that intervene in the most unexpected ways and for the most unexpected reasons! This is the reason it might look confusing in the beginning. But when you get to know the characters, it all gets into place!\r\nArt 8.5/10\r\nThe art is original,but does not stray off from the classic anime animation! Detailed backgrounds, vivid colors even though it's ahas a few darker points and the characters, even if they had the same hair and eye color, you would still be able to tell them apart! All perfect blend for a mystery-comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nApart from the great job of the seiyuu, it's not something amazing or mind blowing. But it's very very good, matching sound and setting. The opening and ending songs are the kind of songs I would have on my phone. The ost when it comes to fight and scheming scenes presents a great result!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOk, the characters are so many, so different and so well created! I don't know how they managed to give a back story to all of them and you come to need them all in your story! There are crazy motives for the plot to evolve, from being utterly bored to looking for a lost head. \\n\r\nIt also includes one of the coolest female characters I've seen (Celty) and one of my most favorite couples!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnough said! I just cannot describe how much I enjoy the black motorcycle, the fights between Shizuo and Izaya and the difference between the night and day life! I love how they mix up seemingly normal, every day characters with urban legends and dark alleys! It's just perfect! \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI am tempted to give it a 10/10, but I don't want to sound too soft. So a 9.5 it is! The quality is high, the work of the production is excellent and the result one of those anime that, in the end, doesn't make you feel silly for watching it!\\n\\n\r\nI know how people say that Baccano (same creators, same philosophy) is better and objectively, it is. But I got more attached to Durarara! for some reason. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. There is a small cameo from Baccano.",

So I pulled an all nighter in the middle of the week and missed school. I just couldn't help myself. This show is definitely one of my all time favorites.",

            "content": "Before season 2 starts in January, I would like to revisit the series that I really like personally. That is Durarara. A interconnected narrative with a large cast similar to Baccano (same author). So let\u2019s go!\r\nSTORY:\r\nDurarara is all about the Black Biker, a dullahan, a headless dullahan. But that is not it, Durarara is all about the Black Biker and the people surrounding her. Although she is not the main protagonist, her presence is the reason why the conflicts in Durarara exist. This is key to all of Narita\u2019s works (the author). This is kind of narrative is exciting and enthralling. This ambitious narrative ishard to do. Interconnected storylines and large cast are really hard things to make the story good. But the atmosphere and its premise makes Durarara pretty accessible. It makes mystery and makes it interesting that we bother enough to continue watching to know what and why is this happening. Durarara is very good at doing its own thing.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nLike I said earlier, Durarara isn\u2019t just about the Black Biker or Mikado. It focuses on many characters each episode and the story is divided to the 3 protagonist. The Harima Mika arc focuses in Mikado, while the Slasher arc focuses in Sonohara, lastly Yellow Scarves arc focuses in Kida. A large cast is typically hard to handle but Durarara is good at this. Not only shows that it has good character writing but it manages to develop their characters further even in a span of 24 episodes. Durarara is good at making its characters interesting while making the story interesting too. \\n\\n\r\nVISUALS:\\n\\n\r\nBrains Base manages to do not only a faithful adaptation but also an innovative one. It has smooth and liquid animation that makes everything better. Little to no animation mistakes or flaws. Aesthetics are good. Fight choreography is decent at best. Personally I like Durarara\u2019s character designs. Well, Brains Base manages to pull an interesting adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/SOUND:\\n\\n\r\nDurarara\u2019s music is amazing. OST are nothing special but its openings and endings are really very good. Uragiri no Yuuyake is one of the catchiest opening themes I have heard. Its endings are good in their own way but I don\u2019t have much to say about it. Complication stands as my favorite anime opening of all time. Graceful lyrics and awesome instrumental. I am not a music critic so I don\u2019t have much to say. Seiyuus did a very good job in portraying the emotions of their respective characters thru voice. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT:\\n\\n\r\nDurarara is ultimately a great show. It manages to do everything it tries to do. It makes an interesting premise that people look forward to. It is an amazing interconnecting narrative that makes use of its characters to the fullest. Durarara makes its own thing interesting, to the very best.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nEnjoymeny - 9\\n\r\nOverall - 9",

            "content": "Expect the unexpected: that phrase doesn't come truer than in Durarara! This anime starts and leads up to an amazing story, backplot, twists and turns that'll leave your stomach in knots. However, towards the end the story falls flat on its face, devoid of deeper meaning or any sort of audience connection as the inner theme prematurely bursts out, forcing you down the gullet of paranoia and a little disappointment.\r\nThe story was told in such a fascinating way, it was hard to grasp at first. It simply wasn't told from a main protagonists point of view, but split among multiple major and minor characters thatall told their individual stories that intertwined like spaghetti. This made for an interesting roller coaster ride: you never knew whose story you would listen to in the episode. The whole three faction conflict, mixed with string-pulling and several interesting characters was most invigorating. Several interesting backgrounds and circumstances were revealed, with each characters' problems laid bare from their internal struggles. Loved it. However, this also made for a bit of confusion: sometimes, the characters had flashbacks or the episode wasn't necessarily in chronological order; but that ALSO made it so exhilarating, holding onto the edge of your seat. But what irked me the most was the build-up: suspense, pent up from the start of the anime, built constantly and continuously throughout the anime as more and more information was revealed. The ending, by far, was the most anticlimatic ending I've ever seen. Ever. In the history of everything I've watched (which I know I haven't watched a lot, but STILL). I was literally so disappointed at the ending, it was like watching a balloon deflate instead of hearing a loud BANG from a needle stabbed suddenly. I wanted to strangle myself......\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: I give the story a 7, because it was yes, overall it was an interesting and new story; however, the ending disappointed the heck out of me.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, however, did not disappoint me in the least. The detail was gorgeous, and if anyone has watched Baccano! before, look for the hidden messages and various details within Durarara. It'll surprise you.... Overall, I enjoyed the characters' lanky feel and the facial expressions were fantastic. There was little the art skimped on; the colors were smooth and flowing, the weather reflected the mood. I know this sounds cliche, but I've seen other animes skimp on the detail, so I give credit where credit is due. \\n\\n\r\nOn man, the songs and background mood music really were astounding. The OP I loved; it was fast-paced and jazzy, just like the overall mood. The ED was pop-sounding and rock-influenced; I loved the ED much more. During key moments in the anime, the music dropped to this foreboding track, and it made me feel much more engrossed. During the happy moments, there was cheerful, peppy song that really deflated the mood and made it bearable again.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were, how can I say, either fantastically engrossing or stubbornly irritating. The main protagonist really grated my nerves for much of the story. Mikado continually refused to impress me, and that contributed to the anime's general decline; however, his backstory sort of explains his situation..... Masaomi, his best bud that carries a dark secret, is a well-developed character that really showed bravado and fortitude, doing everything right and more. A great character. Anri, who also harbors an ominous secret, also could have been one of the best characters of the whole series; however, she really never lives up to my expectations and constantly led me on, only to crash my dreams. The black rider was AMAZING; she really carried the story's underlying message well. Most of the other minor characters, like the hilarious mad-scientist Shinra, the hard-to-understand Shizuo, and the stolid Kadota really packed a punch. It's just two of the main characters really dragged the rest of the crew down, making for an iffy cast.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, what made me so mad was this had so much potential, only to really trip on that one banana peel of character development and story climaxing. Everything else was superb and top-notch; but certain elements really made such a great anime so depressingly.....disappointing. There really is no other word, but I wasn't left with this glowing feeling of satisfaction, just emptiness. Who knows? This may not be your cup of tea; it sure wasn't mine. It was refreshingly entertaining and certainly different than your average Joe anime, but it fell far from the bulls-eye. After all, everything in the end stays the same. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Durarara!! took me by surprise. I went into it fully expecting... well... crap. I had heard that it was a mix of many genres, and nine times out of ten, those kind of anime end up being trainwrecks. I enjoyed Durarara!! a lot more than I thought I would, and I'm hear to tell you just why I did.\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 6/10\r\nThe biggest problem I have with the plot of Durarara!! is how slow it is to start, and how hard it is to get into it. I found myself extremely frustrated trying to get through the first five episodes, and not understanding a thing that washappening. The concept of it itself is just plain stupid, and would have people stay away, for the sole reason of how weird it sounds. A kid transfers schools, and a black biker. \"Ooooooooh how scary.\" But the thing is - how many other shows make a bold leap by offering a unique plot like that? Not many, that's for sure. That is why I felt obliged to keep pushing. And boy, am I glad I did. The plot picks up quickly after that, and I found myself on the edge of my seat in excitement a couple times. The ending as well, was a great end to a great series, and left room for more seasons in case the main series was successful. The start cost a lot of points, but the plot of Durarara!! isn't as bad as it seems like.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in Durarara is pretty dang good. The scenery in the background is the main selling point, as it secretly makes the show look beautiful, as it is not TOO detailed so it clashes with the characters, but is just detailed enough to make the backround beautiful and the characters stand out. It's also very realistic, which I liked, it accurately depicts a modern day city. As for the animation, it isn't Madhouse or Ufotable, but, it is definitely good. The action scenes, or more specifically, when Izaya whips out his knife or when Shizuo swings around a traffic sign, are well done and make the scene more... epic. I don't have many complaints when it comes to the art of the series.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n\"WOAH WOAH WOAH! SOUND?! SIX?! THIS GUY HAS NO IDEA WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT!\" I don't blame you for reacting that way. I would have too. But... as awesome as the opening and ending themes are.... the actual soundtrack doesn't hold up. Well, lets start off with the opening themes. The first opening... IS AMAZING. I didn't skip it, not even once. It perfectly fits with the show giving it a gangster type feel, which is plain epic. The song gets a 9/10 from me, it's just great all around. The second opening... doesn't hold up. It's not bad, in fact I would call it good! It's just... such a step down from the first one that I skipped it every time, wishing the song had never changed. For endings, I was also impressed. I loved the first ending, in fact, it might be the only ending theme I've never skipped. It was so good that I was worried it might make me want the end of the episode to come faster... but it didn't. Just PERFECT! The second ending though... was a massive step down. It was standard, and before this review, I hadn't even listened to the whole thing once. As for the actual soundtrack, it was blended well with the anime and used right, to make the comedic scenes funnier, and the dramatic scenes more astounding. Still though, none of the soundtracks were good enough for me to want to hear them again after listening to them in the anime. Also, near the last couple of episodes, they began to be... repetitive. A minor problem, but still a problem.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nBravo Narita, BRAVO! The characters of Durarara!! are PHENOMENAL! I loved almost every character, they're all so unique, and they all have their own secrets, even the seemingly bland protagonist was AMAZING! THIS is the reason Durarara!! is a must watch, and everyone needs to know! If I had one complaint, it would be that a few of their names are hard to remember, but WHO CARES! IZAYA! CELTY! SHIZUO! SIMON! KIDA! I LOVE THEM ALL!.... is what I would like to say. Still as an analyst, the characters of DRRR!! are great, but they aren't the best I've ever seen. If anything about them bothered me, it would be their designs, which can sometimes make them not stick out from the crowd of unidentified supporting characters. It's as if, every character is balanced, and there isn't one better than the other. \\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nA seven might seem like a low score, but trust me, Durarara!! is worth it. It was a good anime, nothing groundbreaking, but, I would recommend it to most people, and most people will like it! Now, boot up a website and give it a try, and trust me, it won't just be a waste of time!\\n",

So, why do I love it?\r\nWelp.\r\nI adore the characters, from the quirky and cute to the nasty and strong, this anime has a wide range of relatable characters that I fell in love with. Par Izaya.  It even has my all time favourite character, Shizuo motherfucking Heiwajima,  which is now a body pillow on my bed. I know, I need a life. \r\nEven now after about seven years after watching it, I constantly re-read the manga on my shelf. \r\nThe setting was somethingfresh to me, as it took place in downtown Tokyo, yet made it feel like it was just like a little village where everyone knew each other. Which was nice.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't know that the original Durarara story came from a Light Novel, so with the back and forth story telling and fast exposition, I found it a bit stunting. There were parts were the text moved very quickly and being a non-Japanese speaker I had to change to an English dub just to follow the story. Personally, I'm very picky when it comes to English Dubs, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was a good dub, with decent actors. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, this is my favourite anime of all time. I strongly recommend it to anyone because there's something for everyone.",

All the openings and ednings are just ON POINT, I ensure you will be feeling nostalgic when you hear OST's because they will sit in your heart long time after watching!!! But the main advantage is the composition of each episode. It is managed to combine so many stories in one andeach episode and make up connections between them so that in the end of episode you feel like it was the one whole story! And finally you will have SO MANY SURPRISES AND CHANGES AND SHOKING TWISTS i cannot describe!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - ENJOY, ENJOY, ENJOY!!!!",

            "content": "**finally got strenght enough to finish the last 4 episodes....holy shit that was a headache - felt like a chore**\r\nDurarara!! is an anime about ..... About what ? This is the taste that stays in my mouth, the more I delve into the plot. There are so many characters, with such bland backstories, that the plot itself, which unfolds episodically, exists for the simple fact of making the anime keep going, despite having no destination. The narrative wants to be a web of interconnected revelations, which in the end, feels entangled. Each episode in which we have a small (and forced) flashback to try toemerge some connection of the viewer with a character, the series sinks in personality development and ecstasy of revelations. A world and actions that need to be explained by the characters themselves in each episode, what each gang does or did and why, in that way, makes this universe's image less convincing. Finally, this \"gang war\" becomes the main focus of the anime shortly after the fragile introductions. But anyway, is the plot about that? Or about something else?\\n\\n\r\nIs it about high school friendship? Yes. But without the high school life itself - the 3 student protagonists have beaten personalities that do not evolve. They exchange very few deep or thought-provoking dialogues.\\n\r\nIs it supernatural? Yes. But that is lost trying to merge the supernatural with the real. It presents itself in an original way in the first episodes, to become irrelevant over time.\\n\r\nIs it about fights and urban life? Yes. But the more you are obliged to hear about \"city life\" and how things are, the more boring and tedious are the events - for example, when they morph in extraordinarily weak or expendable moments of action ( looking at you, fight with \"gray zombies\" with knives).\\n\\n\r\nThis anime could be about a lot of things, but it wants so much to show the variety of themes and to reveal the hidden and ugly urban life, which serves us a medium, uninteresting (with an almost childlike vision), with shells of characters that do not bloom. You hate violence and still make use of it because \"you do not know how to be otherwise\", not only is schizophrenic, as it is a clich\u00e9 (believe it or not, this is the face of the character Heiwajima Shizuo). The mysteries are unmasked in a simple and predictable way - and in some cases as of Celty Sturluson (the \"supernatural\" character who is a headless creature, called dullahan) in an anticlimatic way. Relationships are superficial, without substance.\\n\r\nIn fact, the only character that caught my eye and seemed different to the point of being explored was the supporting Brezhnev Semyon. A black russian man working in a sushi restaurant. And yet, I feel that if they had turned the spotlight on him at some point, they would probably end up making him less interesting than he appeared to be.\\n\\n\r\nOnly with this amount of information, you can get an idea that Durarara !! covers various corners of different genres. A great variety puree, that tastes like nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe good points are the audiovisual and environment. Often the scenery and animation has an interesting tone. But this idea of \u200b\u200bhighlighting the protagonists in graying the rest of the extras only passes the assumption of cretinism of the production.\\n\r\nThe songs, in fact, are the best the series could offer me. The 2 opening songs were really good (can't say that about the endings tho).\\n\\n\r\nI would give a 4.0 / 10.0: it is average/bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is not bad - it seems that it tries to take itself seriously, but afraid of really being serious.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI also tried watching Baccano, but fell asleep in the third episode. I guess that I just don't like these shounen that tries to look like seinen. It's childish, indeed. Durarara!! is the shounen that thinks is edgy and profound but just sounds like a teenage ranting. Probably the target audience are people under their 20's.\\n\r\nI would recommend to those who like something that is different, but at the same time does not go too deep - it's just shallow.",

In my opinion he was pathetic.   \\n\\n\r\nI cannot understand why it is rated so high as there are other anime's that are rated lower that are much better in comparison to this anime.  \\n\\n\r\nI am not going to continue to watch this anime seeing as I in plain words hated it.  \\n\r\n( and I never hate anime this is the exception)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Durarara!! is a story that takes place in Ikebukuro, Tokyo, really focusing on no group of characters in particular, but instead spreading its focus on the entire cast. Featuring characters ranging in personality from an uncanny level of eccentricity to a calm and often quirky lifestyle, Durarara!! brings an interesting amount of contrast to the characters of the show, in a degree that is seen in very few anime. Just as there is no main focus on any of the characters, there is also no main focus on any single plot of Durarara!!.\r\nDespite having such a broad cast, the director, Takahiro Omori does an outstandingjob of utilizing each and every character. All of the characters are extremely unique, and very well developed, providing an excellent cast, which supplements the various plots rather well. All the characters are very likeable, and capable of making moments of comedy, drama, and awe.\\n\r\nDurarara!! has an extremely well developed plot, which makes excellent use of all of its side stories, eventually weaving them all into one conclusive story that will leave any viewer amazed. Among these side stories are Celty\u2019s quest for her missing head, the investigation of the \u201cslashing incidents\u201d, the fights between the \u201ccolor gangs\u201d and the \u201cDollars\u201d, the search for the strongest person in Ikebukuro, and the daily adventures of Ryuugamine, Kida, and Sonohara.\\n\r\nCelty is a \u201cdullahan\u201d which is a headless fairy from Irish mythology. She left Ireland with a scientist and his son Shinra, to move to Ikebukuro as she thought that might be where her head was. During the story, she lives in an apartment with Shinra, using her free time to search for her lost head. Shinra is an underground surgeon who operates on people injured in gang fights, or people who don\u2019t have the insurance to cover the required operation.\\n\r\nThe \u201cSlasher\u201d is a mysterious figure who has been going around the city killing random people, and causing an uproar in the underworld, as each gang thinks that the enemy gangs are in charge of the slasher, and that their targeting the opposing gangs.\\n\r\nThe three major gangs in Ikebukuro have re-emerged from a time of peace, after the \u201cYellow Scarves\u201d and \u201cBlue Squares\u201d fought a gang war, and exhausted themselves. The \u201cDollars\u201d, a gang formed online, have risen to prominence on the streets of Tokyo, subduing themselves in the gang fights occurring throughout the city.\\n\r\nNewspaper writers around the city have found themselves intrigued in the search for the strongest person in Ikebukuro, as everyone around town has been talking about the fighting between the gangs. Simon from Russia Sushi, Heiwajima Shizuo the bartender, Celty, the Slasher, and an informant named Izaya, are all being pursued by newspaper writers to find out which one of them is really the strongest in Ikebukuro.\\n\r\nThen come the daily adventures of Ryuugamine, Kida, and Sonohara. The three are all students at Raira Academy, and seem to get involved in all of the side stories presented throughout the anime. Ryuugamine is a well mannered student, who moved from a small country village to Tokyo in hope of living a more exciting life. Kida, is an eccentric and perverted teenager, and is one of the reasons that Ryuugamine moved to Tokyo, as he asked his old friend to come and visit the big city. Sonohara is a timid and rather quiet girl who tags along with Ryuugamine and Kida, and is the center of the love triangle that the three form together.\\n\r\nDurarara!! has a very refreshing sound track, which seems to use a full ensemble of jazz instruments, including the piano, and a variety of brass instruments, which provides high, sharp notes to magnify the surprise of the moment. The stand up bass is also used very well, as it is able to create a feeling of a calm and laid back setting. The opening and ending soundtracks are nothing special, but they fit the feeling of the anime well, so there\u2019s no reason to complain. The voice actors are very fitting in their roles, each one voicing their characters in a way that accentuates their personalities.\\n\r\nThe artwork in Durarara!! is a good change of pace from the usual shiny haired characters of most anime. The hair of the characters is unique in the sense that each characters hair has several strands out of place, but not in a way that makes the art look sloppy, just more realistic. Another touch that I found to be nice was that any of the random bystanders were a colorless shade of gray, which highlighted the important characters, and added a nice amount of contrast to each scene.\\n\r\nWhile Durarara!! may have started off a bit slow, it was for a good reason, as the beginning of the series was used to introduce the many plots and characters in a minimal period of time. As things pick up, Durarara!! reaches a level of enjoyment that has only been matched for me by a select number of anime. When all the plots are strung together, I find it hard to believe that anyone would not appreciate the masterful execution of the plot. Durarara!! is a series that I would recommend to anyone who likes any of the genres of Durarara!!, or for that matter anyone who wants to see a well executed anime. There\u2019s a reason that Durarara!! is already being talked about as the 2010 anime of the year.\\n",

            "content": "Durarara!! is a anime that got known and nowadays has a nice rate among the viewers. \r\nIn general this anime is good, although there are some points that i would like to talk about. \r\nStory: 9/10. If there is story more complex than this one? Well at least i did not saw one more complex than this one yet. This story is not a story but a lot of small stories together. If this anime is good, it's because of the plot twists. I would like to tell you the main theme here but honestly i can\u00b4t. There are just so many that you canchose by your self. If i had to choose, i would say that there are 2 main stories here on the first show, then there a lot of small ones, but they are all related! And this is why i loved this show. Usually we see a background story that is the same for everyone and then we have the development of it with the time. Here ? Well such things happens to although in a different way. The most interesting fact is that they can tell us 4 5 ou even more stories at once, everyone happens at the same time and everyone end up being conected somehow. So basically the way that the stories are developed is totally different. At least it was the first time that i saw such thing. \\n\\n\r\nAbove all this, the story is original, creative and we also get an idea of how is it like living in a city.\\n\r\nI did not found any plot holes, the all story fits together and there are no missing parts. Everything is properly explained, so if you see an episode and if you think you are lost, don\u00b4t worry it is normal on this show. They will tell you everything right in the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u00b4t tell you one more thing that made this anime so interesting, otherwise i would be spoiling.. check that out for yourself. This anime is full of secrets and it is nice to figure them out as we go through the story. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10). In gerenal it is good. The background is OK. The character design is OK. There are no bad points here, just small good ones xD. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (8/10). I think that the first opening is brutal. Really nice to hear and fits well with the anime. The rest is cool for it's purpose but nothing else. While in some animes, some OST can be memorable and we will never forget them, here it doesn\u00b4t happen. Everything is relatively okay, no big deal but that doesn\u00b4t mean they are bad. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10). Individually they all look good characters but not good enough for a 9/10. All together? Well that is another thing. Like in the story, here we don\u00b4t see 1 2 3 or even 4 characters getting a decent development. Remember we have 24 episodes, although they explore pretty well more than 9 characters ! I do not remember them all, but i do know for sure 9 characters got a nice development plus all the others that i'm not remembering at the moment. \\n\\n\r\nNow you ask? But having so many characters being developed at the same time doesn\u00b4t make the story confuse? NO. Yes you may get lost but don\u00b4t worry, as I said and I repeat, they all are connected. If one character gets development, it's because that character is important for the plot. Every character here has their own way to be and everyone has a pretty decent past. Plus with the twists that we see in some characters, just makes the story and the entire anime much more cool. I would say that this multiple development of plot and characters makes this anime a anime that everyone must see. In fact we don\u00b4t find such thing in other shows. At least i didn\u00b4t. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (7/10). There is a bad point of having so many stories and characters being developed at once. The anime is boring for the first part, until the 10th episode it's hard to watch. After that it gets more interesting but still it is not enough to \"pay\" for the first part. But don\u00b4t let this turn you down. Now the second show is being released and it's just getting better and better. When we get used to the way that they develop things, we just realize how cool it is and how interesting it gets. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime i think it will be on my memory for a long time, the plot is crazy, the characters also are crazy and the twists .. oh my this anime has the best plot twist that i've ever saw ! And i'm not over reacting. Usually we see one or 2 big twists. Here, well i lost my count. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo if you are looking for something completely out of the boundaries, check this one. It is amazing how the plot and how the characters are developed and how everything ends up together.",

            "content": "Durarara!! is a compilation of stories with various highlights that brings different view and interpretation to the viewers. A content that evolved and has been developed inside a so-called society named \u2018Ikebukuro\u2019. It contains a balanced pace where the occurrences of the story are being told in a fast-slow manner while adding lots \u201cI mean LOTS\u201d of interesting plot to bend.\r\nBeginning with its introduction, at first, it may be some typical storytelling of events that we might have seen before but when the story rolls you may be attracted on its different way of introducing characters and events that seems promising. \r\nThe show holds somany interesting plots and laughable gag which became amusing and a big factor why this show proves that it\u2019s different than the other shows. Also, the show introduces characters and events in such a way that it picks up the good vibes, episode by episode, having a feeling of shock and awe while being presented to give great amusement. \\n\\n\r\nObviously, it stands out on creating wonderful plots, connecting each of the dots, twisting some important arcs that have a capability to excite viewers, and giving an experience throughout the environment and scenes that became worth while. All I can say is that they\u2019ve done a great job on developing such plots but there is quite a flaw to it; it may lacks on impact, some of the highlights seems fading away without a trace, and a possibility that the thrill found on the other arcs would not be the same or equal, so up to this point I find it quite a problem as some of them became weak.\\n\\n\r\nIkebukuro is simply a neighborhood where great events and mysteries are bound to happen. Consisting of people with different attitudes, status, and form of living, the involvement of these characters truly shines as it liven up the surroundings and giving amazing feedback that brings quite an attraction for the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, without such characters, this show wouldn\u2019t be that great as these characters are piled to meet the expectation of the viewers such as Izaya, Shizuo, Celty, the trio (Masaomi, Mikado and Anri), and also with the involvement of all the characters. Arc by arc, such characters have created good stories to tell and to see which revolves between main and supporting characters and within the society itself, by that it maintains the show to its high level of excitement.  \\n\\n\r\nIt seems that not only the story and characters correlates but also the art and theme gives fascinating view which is truly a nice pair throughout the whole series. If you\u2019re fond of a nice and detailed art, this series would fit for you as it contains a clean and bright art within a gloomy and peculiar scene. It outshines and adds effects that bring pleasure and good ambiance for the audience to feel.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, adding these great aspects (voice emphasis, sound effects, background sounds) it brings the series at its fullest, as these helps to appreciate more what is being told and being presented on such scenes. Don\u2019t forget the sounds for the OP Theme & ED Theme which also puts such effort to give lovely and melodic music for the intros and ends.\\n\\n\r\nAs an overall, the series contains many interesting plots that give various level of excitement, a nicely animated and drawn that will attract viewers from watching it, nice soundtracks and effects that makes the series more attractive and fun, creative character attitudes and design that helps the story became more appealing. It has a nice package of entertainment that will vary to the taste of the viewer one after the other.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end it is worth while watching this but for me I just truly enjoyed only half of the total series or some picked arcs while the others is quite a filler just to be entertained until it meets its climax.",

            "content": "I'll just go blunt.In its very core state, if one were to define or explain this jolly anime in one word, it would indeed be \"random\".However, what needs to be specifically mentioned along with this is that it's just not a random random in which things happen and don't even have a meaning, its a quite \"intertwined\" random, stuff happens randomly but its still all joined together, all really quite connected with the formar happenings - all this happening to fulfill the puppetmasterish desires of one single person.\r\nThe main story if I were to describe in my own words, is very different from what's writtenofficially on most sites; the sites only seem to explain the plotline from the point of view of the very first episode, but it really is only a part of the whole huge drama.Like Mikado, every other character seems to have his own past and a specific point in lifetime due to which they all get connected in only one subcity.The starting might be set even some twenty years prior to the current timeline where all the stuff to Celty happens, and then Izaya emerges on the spot to make it all just more complex, even though there are many things Izaya isn't involved in, the biggest example being how Kida and Mikado start their own gangs and how Anri ends up with how she ends up with (no spoilers), and all the things that Doctor guy with Celty and his father does in the beginning.Its interesting how all this cool stuff happens in the same one place, Ikebukoro, and then Izaya being the guy who adds the fuel to the fire, the guy due to whom the whole setting gets so much interconnected.\\n\\n\r\nIzaya Orihara - one of the most interesting characters I've encountered in anime.Prolly a psychopath, a very interesting psychopath though, is a guy who's just very much interested in human beings.He doesn't care about anything or anyone but just loves humans in general, mainly he's just interested in human nature and the way humans react to specific circumstances around them.This very nature of him is revealed in the very first episodes but slowly and surely he just becomes the main strength of progressing the storyline, the \"puppet master\" who just treats all human beings as pawns in order to fulfill his own desires - the desire to relish the diversity and fascination of human nature.Yeah, he's that kind of psycho who's interested neither in money nor sex nor being the best or achieving anything great in his life; all he's interested in are humans.Interesting isn't it? And what seems to make his character even more worthwhile is his occasional use of philosophical concepts, all his \"God\" and afterlife theory and everything supernatural that occurs around him.Quite surprisingly, he's a guy who holds belief in all supernatural and inexplainable phenomenon around him yet doesn't hold a belief in god, he actually sometimes wonders if he himself is the God.His over all complexity explained in the simplest tone, a rather \"couldn't care less\" personality yet flourishing with such thought provoking concepts, yeah he's one of the most intriguing guys in anime.And his level of information about almost everything makes him even more badass.\\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters in this anime are also quite fascinating, which actually might be the reason behind the wide success of this anime, along with some other reasons too obviously.Celty being the point of everything just after Izaya is just too nice for a monster, a likable character, and then there's Shizuo.The episode I am at till now, Shizuo doesn't seem to hold much importance in the major happenings of the story, which is kind of a pity, considering how much of an epic character he actually is.Mikado and Kida and Kadota gang are some other cool characters, though Mikado with all his past and what he did still kind of seems bland.And then however there are still those characters who couldn't annoy you more with their stupidity and over-prevailing emotional imbalances, like Seiji Yagiri for example.His love was very stupid in my opinion, and his stalker Mika Harima was even more stupid, like I mean seriously the guy literally banged her head in the wall and nearly killed her and she was still ready to have a plastic surgery and change her appearance JUST for HIM? That's not a very human-like behaviour I tell you, both of them are prolly mentally ill and need a treatment.Anri was, well I'm still confused whether I even like her.The type of character she holds is the one I have always hated in anime girls, and even though she's got some solid past to be what she really is, she's still just not interesting, no not even with all her power.Some characters in this anime are very good and some other just a plain pain in the ass.\\n\\n\r\nThe story progress in Durarara is very different, it uses nearly all the methods of story telling I yet know of, except for the symbolism.It takes start somewhere off in the \"middle\", slowly and slowly opening up all the links and revealing them, both with the happenings in the present and the character's pasts.What makes it all the more interesting is that Izaya's usually behind everything that happens.The flashbacks help lend development not only to the characters but also to the story, they're \"important\" for the story, which is why most of flashbacks are not boring or useless.The anime does a very good job at keeping its viewers interested in main characters and not diverting attention.Except Shizuo and that russian sushi guy, there's nothing in the story I've found being pointless (Note:As I mentioned above, Shizuo is very interesting, but just seems pointless.By the way, I'm still at episode 18 so i don't know if he is of any use later in the story.No, fighting the Saika army didn't make him of any concrete importance to the story progress.)\\n\\n\r\nThe urban vibe in the story and all the gangs and criminal stuff makes it even more interesting, and the best thing is, the story remains true to its basic core and doesn't deal much with all the \"right and wrong phenomenon\".Everything that happens for a character, happens good or bad only from his/her own perspective.This non-philosophical approach is quite good if you're looking for something to watch just to lighten your mood.Even with all its complexities and interlinks, Durarara still manages to maintain a light mood in its progress.I won't say it fails to develop interest, because at the end of every episode I was compelled to watch the next one in order to know what happens next, and yet still it wasn't the type with which I can get absolutely hooked or just not be able to get up from my seat while watching it, which from my point of view, is a positive.Such light and yet interesting and complex stories can be good for your health as well as to maintain your mood.The pacing is also quite moderate, enough for one to feel easy while watching it and not end up confused with all the drama that happens.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound isn't something I can write much on, because quite frankly I didn't even notice it much during watching the anime.All I can say is, its not dull and keeps up with the mood.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good and moderate, its a very colourful anime which is the main thing.But even in all its colour, it holds some good supernatural and dark themes.The anime can be funny and dark at the same time, much like a little child who has a great deal of emotional mood springs.The anime is not annoying.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, my experience with this anime was quite good.I enjoyed it, I got to see some thoroughly interesting characters and a good drama, and that makes it all worth it.The anime can prove a very good time pass",

Bye!\r\nAlright alright alright (channelling my inner McConaughey) SO lets begin with the story!\r\nSo basically to word the synopsis in a better way (in relation to the story)  - a young boy moves to Ikebukuro on his BFF's request and starts a life there. He is cautioned against multiple gangs/people/places etc and is told of an urban legend - the headless blackbiker *dun dun duuuuunnnn* A bunch of occurrences take place surrounding around 12 differentpeople who eventually all become acquaintances and find their stories all intertwining and coming together to make the ultra magnificent anime we know as DURARARA!! Mix a little dose of light comedy, action and drama and you have yourself the perfect weekend!\\n\\n\r\nNow, it can be a tad confusing and by confusing I mean - you feel like you missed something in the story, but dont let that bring you down my friends BECAUSE thats the way the story is layed out! Each episode is connected to another two or more episodes to complete a sub story that was never finished in another episode.. get it? If not, then watch it and you'll know what I mean xD \\n\\n\r\nThe art is what it is. Very distinctive and matches the kind of story this is. What I mean there is - if it was done too modernly or ancient - it would feel more like an American History movie than a story about supernatural phenomena taking place in a small city in Tokyo! ... or something like that lol. Both OP's are catchy and adventurous! The osts are really well done as well! They have catchy classical piano and violin pieces as well as action sequence music! Very well done.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters in Durarara, no matter how minor their role or how big - they get character development something chronic! Our three main protagonists develop much deeper than you could have initially guessed which is one of the main reasons I love the development in this show! The fact that every character has a story of their own and also their own narration in an episode allows you to really connect with and understand who they truly are, motives, dreams and all. \\n\\n\r\nThis is such a fantastic anime!! One that I would recommend ANYONE to watch! It really pulls you in and gives you a sense of mystery, satisfaction and drama! Plusssss there are two more seasons so if that doesnt entice you enough than this review should xD and if you made it all the way down here then I am clapping for you my friend! \\n",

            "content": "Strangely enough, it's not really that common for a novel or manga writer to have more than one of their works adapted into an anime series. Most authors only get their one brief glimmer of TV spotlight, though whether this is due to the quality of their writing or the fact that they simply don't write many different stories is another matter entirely. However, when a writer with a very distinctive style does get that long sought after second adaptation, it might come as no surprise that they carry over a lot of the samethemes and styles from their first work. So, is it fair to judge a series based on the author's previous work, especially when that previous work is widely regarded as a masterpiece?\\n\\n\r\n          I find this anime somewhat difficult to review on its own simply because of its origins. Narita is a rather prolific light novel writer who is also well-known for the anime adaptation of his very first light novel series, Baccano!, and I find myself almost constantly comparing Durarara!! to Baccano!, not just because Baccano! is the first series that I ever gave a perfect 10, and not just because they're so similar in writing style, but because they also have practically the exact same anime staff: same director, same writer, same animation studio, and ever the same soundtrack composer. In staff alone, Durarara!! is essentially a Baccano!-style story set in present-day Japan rather than Prohibition-era New York, and this idea comes with both astounding potential and unavoidable flaws.\\n\\n\r\n          With that in mind, I found the overall story to be incredibly exhilarating. Once a certain story line got going, it had this ability to continuously pick up speed and intensity and eventually became a whirlwind sprint towards a massive and exciting conclusion. Like Baccano! (hopefully I won't exhaust this phrase too much during this review), we see tons of details interwoven into different scenes that feed into an overarching plot that grows in complexity as the story progresses, though unlike its predecessor, Durarara!! is told in chronological order for the most part, rather than skipping around the timeline like Baccano! did. However, because Durarara!! contains more than one story arc, it does have a tendency to lose a lot of its steam during the transition between arcs, especially after the halfway point, but fortunately it does still manage to get the ball rolling again and build up the same intensity that it had before.\\n\\n\r\n          Like Baccano!, Durarara!! touches on a lot of philosophical themes and motifs, though the ones in this series seem much more grounded in human psychology and life itself. Themes like perspective of reality end up pushing the plot forward a lot more than one would expect, and the series also dabbles in usage of modern technology like the Internet, chat rooms, and media sensationalism in a way that seems like the writers have a fundamental understanding of how these things really affect communication rather than including them because \"that's what the kids are into these days.\" I was also a huge fan of how the chat room specifically was used as a framing device for the story's narrative, as different people from around Ikebukuro discussed the current events of the city. Also like Baccano!, this series uses a large amount of supernatural elements to keep certain sections of its plot going, though rather than have the entire story be based on these supernatural elements, they exist more to introduce new ideas and new possibilities into the story.\\n\\n\r\n          Again like Baccano!, this anime has an absolutely massive character cast, with practically every character getting more than enough screen time for us to fall in love with them. Mikado starts off as the standard \"blank-slate good guy\" protagonist who's trying to get used to the city and make new friends, but the ways that he becomes involved in the events of Ikebukuro, either by his own doing or because of someone else, cause him to grow in ways that let us get more attached to him as the default \"main character.\" His best friend, Masaomi, comes off as a lovable goofball playboy who knows the ins and outs of everything about Ikebukuro, but we also get hints about his mysterious past with the city that grow more intense and powerful as the story progresses, especially in the second half of the series. Rounding off our main character trio is Anri, a rather shy girl at Raira Academy that Mikado and Masaomi grow very close to, and she provides not only an interesting character to ponder over, but also a somewhat different take on romantic relationships. Speaking of romance, Durarara!! relies quite heavily on romantic relationships between characters, and each relationship seems somehow off-kilter and odd in some way that breaks away from a lot of the standard anime relationships that we're used, both for better and for worse.\\n\\n\r\n          The rest of the character cast also manages to be incredibly lively and fascinating as well. From Ky\u014dhei's group of friends who provide tons of comic relief, to the superhuman bouts of rage courtesy of Shizuo Heiwajima, the cast of this series brings Ikebukuro to life in ways that almost make the city itself feel like its own character. We even get a supernatural character in the form of Celty aka the Black Rider, a headless figure that strike fear into the hearts of evildoers in Ikebukuro, and her arc in the first half of the series was incredibly compelling. However, the one character that stands out the most by far is the info broker Izaya Orihara, whose fascination with human interactions and his almost horrifying grip on the entire city makes him one of my favorite antiheroes of all time. Unfortunately, I will say that this series doesn't really have as strong a cast of antagonists as Baccano! did. There aren't really any Slizard Quates or Ladd Russo kinds of antagonists (though Shizuo does feel like Ladd in some regards), and street gangs just don't have the same prestige and power that mafia thugs have, so it ends up being more of a flaw with the setting rather than the writing.\\n\\n\r\n          The animation was produced by Brain's Base, and we get yet another fantastic treat for the eyes as this studio brings its A-game once again. The character designs are incredibly unique and appealing, the cityscape is drawn beautifully and almost feels like it comes to life sometimes, and the action is visceral and exhilarating, with each punch having tremendous impact that can almost be felt through the screen. The production crew also inserted a ton of Easter eggs from different anime throughout the series, from superstar shows like Toradora! to underground artsy works like Le Portrait de Petit Cossette. We even get a few cameos of our favorite dynamic duo from Baccano!, as well as a plethora of other references to the series. I also found it rather interesting how they drew certain background characters. Many times, background characters in anime are often drawn as simple gray silhouettes, and while this often comes across as lazy in other works, Durarara!!\ufeff actually manages to stylize this in a way that provides visual accents to the series, from highlighting a single person in a sea of faceless people, to making the different color gangs of the city more distinguishable.\\n\\n\r\n          On the topics of dubs, this might be one of the best dubs that Bang Zoom! has ever produced, which should throw up a few flags for my regular readers, as I am usually very quick to rip this company's throat out for shoddy dub work. Michelle Ruff gives a stellar performance as Anri, and Bryce Papenbrook, a voice actor that I have not tried to hide my disdain for, gives his best performance yet as our playboy Masaomi. Admittedly, Darrel Guilbeau as Mikado is definitely the weakest member of the cast, which is rather unfortunate because his forced acting comes up so often. However, any dub that has Steve Blum (Ky\u014dhei), Johnny Yong Bosch (Izaya), and Crispin Freeman (Shizuo) in the same anime and at such a high level of captivating performances should not be missed even by the most avid dub haters.\\n\\n\r\n          The soundtrack was composed by Makoto Yoshimori, and he brings the same jazz-infused cacophony that he gave to the Baccano! soundtrack. Almost every track adds weight to the scenes that they are assigned to, be they spastic jazz trumpet solos or heartwarming piano melodies. The openings themes \"Uragiri no Yuuyake\" by Theatre Brook and \"Complication\" by ROOKiEZ is PUNK'D provide adrenaline-pumping rushes to play us into each episode, while the ending themes \"Trust Me\" by Yuya Matsushita and \"Butterfly\" by ON/OFF play us out with some chill pop numbers.\\n\\n\r\n          While it is unfair to constantly compare this series to Baccano!\ufeff, practically every problem that I had with Durarara!!\ufeff was something that its predecessor did excessively well. Nevertheless, Durarara!!\ufeff is still an exhilarating ride that I highly recommend seeing as soon as you can.",

The only problem is that the beginning is very slow and some things did not really make a whole lot of sense until later in the series. I put this anime on hold a lotuntil maybe episode 6. After that I started to watch it regularly and I found myself engulfed in the story and mystery.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the reasons why the introduction to the series is so confusing is probably because the series is an amalgamation of interconnected stories. Which is fun to try and connect, but it is confusing if you are not focusing all your attention on what is happening.\\n\\n\r\nI give the characters a 10 out of 10. I said that they are some of my most favorite characters and the reason being is that they are all drastically different from one another. No one character is like another. There is Shizuo Heiwajime, the strongest man in Ikebukuro. Strong enough to hurl a vending machine across a city. There is Celty Sturluson, a headless motorcycle rider, who is really a supernatural being from Ireland. There is Izaya Orihara, an information broker with a god complex. Those are just the one that really stand out.\\n\\n\r\nOnce the anime picked up momentum, I really enjoyed it. The world of Durarara!! is really chaotic and there is a lot happening, but I think that if you like multiple storylines, interesting characters, and just craziness, you will enjoy Durarara!!

            "content": "Wow. I had fairly low expectations coming in to watching this, it seemed to me like another generic \"take itself too serious\"-type show, and would have some poorly written, generic plot to go along with it.\r\n Boy, was I wrong. \r\nThe show has an astounding amount of depth to such a clean and intriguing story. The plot is very original, dealing with relationships, betrayal, and secrets, allowing great room for character development. The diverse cast make for a very entertaining crew, each of the \"side\"-characters had a fully developed feel to them, not cliche' and half baked as I went in expecting.\r\nThe crisp energetic feelof the city, along with the beautiful quality put into the animation are highly pleasing, and add some really important, and commonly overlooked elements to the show. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite element though, was how the entire series constantly kept the viewer engaged, unveiling crucial parts of the story and characters pasts, which always seem to have a domino effect on the rest of the story, and the futures of each of the other characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a great show. I would suggest it to anyone who's a general fan of fast-paced, lighthearted series. Even if you're not completely sold on the genre, the enjoyment the show emanates should rub off on almost any viewer, and certainly makes a good last minute watch before the winter season is upon us. \\n\\n\r\n:]",

            "content": "Life in the city is chaotic and messy, and as someone who's lived in a small city for years and has lived in multiple big cities for months at a time, it's easy to feel lost in the sensation and in the beat of the crowd. Durarara is a show that echoes this idea, and in its massive cast of characters and its massive story pieces, it shows what the real life of the city is: Its people. \r\nOur story takes place in Tokyo's Ikebukuro district, and centers around some of its most interesting inhabitants. Durarara has a main cast so large that it wouldbe counterproductive for me to try and describe all of them, so I'll take my time to go in depth on the 6 most important of the bunch:\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, we have Mikado Ryugamine, a shy and introverted transfer student to Raira academy. Mikado is the first character the show introduces you too, and we learn about a lot of Ikebukuro through his eyes. Mikado is a character who loves life, and who wants to live a life far different to that of other men. This leads to him getting stuck in a lot of drama starting in the Bukuro. He's a surprisingly interesting character, and while he doesn't end up developig as much as I would have liked, he is definitely a great character.\\n\\n\r\nNextly, we have Masaomi Kida. The comic relief character, Kida is one of the most well developed and sympathetic characters in this whole show, taking a massive leading role in the second season. Kida is your typical high school student, a joker who likes hitting on girls. I'd say more, but I can't reveal any of the great character developments of the second season.\\n\\n\r\nRounding out the high school club, we have Anri Sonohara. The vessel for the second season's most surprising twist, Sonohara has a tragic backstory that leaves her a much less emotional person than before. She is the typical highschool bookworm in season one, and provides a very good love interest for Mikado. \\n\\n\r\nFirst in the grownup characters, we have Shizuo Heiwajima. A man who literally cannot control his own strength, Shizuo is known as the strongest man in Ikebukuro. A really interesting static character, Shizuo's anger and his hatred for Izaya Orihara make for a great relationship and an incredible character.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of rivalries, the persay \"villain\" of the show, the information broker Izaya Orihara, is honestly one of the more interesting characters in the show. A man who claims to love humans, Izaya is generally the starting point through which all conflicts flow. Izaya loves to see how humans react to various situations, and spends his time either collecting or giving out information. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have Celty Sturlson, AKA the headless rider. A mythical faerie from the land of ireland, Celty is attempting to find her head. She's a great character, and I love her a ton, but I just can't explain why I do. Watch the show and you'll find out why I love her so. \\n\\n\r\nSomething highly positive I can say about Durarara that I can say about very few anime is that it takes the time to develop its characters. Using a unique art style that has only main, focal characters colored, Durarara's main characters all have interwoven backstories, and interwoven plots such that everyone has a relationship with just about anyone. With the first season being a large amount of character based episodes, just about every character gets their due. Each episode shows different aspects of a character and different aspects of a city as well. \\n\\n\r\nOn the Art, Durarara is clean and well animated. Few of the animations were highly complex, but all the character designs were great, and I was very impressed with the reveal of the dollars. All the shadows becoming colored at once wasn't excessively complex, but it was enough to impress me. Brain Base is, as always, animating some damn good episodes. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of Music, the soundtrack was very good, although there were few standout tracks other than the Slasher's theme, which I don't know the name of. The track itself was incredibly creepy and strange, and I was very impressed by how much it seemed to explain the personality of the slasher. Props also go to the first opening's theme song Uragiri no Yuuyake, which is a great tune and helped hook me in on the show. \\n\\n\r\nSo, the time comes for my biggest complaint with the series, and It really saddens me to say this. Durarara suffers heavily from Little brother syndrome, and Durarara is Brains Base's way of trying to catch lightning in a bottle twice and create another Baccano. And I'll be damned if I say that they haven't done an admirable job of it, but at its heart, it wants to be Baccano so very bad, and it just can't be damned to break from that mold. And that really disappointed me, because it had enough potential to be a masterpiece of a show, but by refusing to break from that mold, it just fizzled. \\n\\n\r\nSo, in terms of reccomendations, I would reccomend watching this, but after you watch Baccano. Durarara is covered in references to the show, and to fully appreciate them, you need to see the show. Dub or Sub wise, I'd go with Sub. The actors are great either way, but the Japanese just fits better there, and I prefer Izaya's seiyyu to JYB's voice, weirdly enough.",

Just watching the opening shows that there are a lot of main characters to become invested in. Some characters are more fleshed out than others, and for the first 10 episodes you will find yourself asking \"What the hell is going on?\".\r\nHowever, once you meet all the players the story becomes really good. There are definitely some crazy people in this world, and the show becomes more enjoyable for it. I would say the charactersand the plotting are definitely the highlights of this series. You can tell this was based on a light novel, as there are lots of scenes with narration explaining character thoughts and providing exposition.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and sound are average. The characters look different enough that you can tell everyone apart, and the music changes to match the scene. I watched the English dub (which is available on Crunchyroll) which I thought serviced the story well.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is intense. If you enjoy supernatural crime drama stories, then you will enjoy this show. I was so emotionally invested in the conflicts between characters and groups in the story that I actually got angry at the TV a couple times.",

            "content": "After watching the first episode of Durarara, the first thought that would probably go through anyone's mind is 'WTF did I even watch?' That was what I was certainly thinking and like its predeccesor Baccano, Durarara is not for the faint of heart. If you're not will to stretch your brain's limits and put all your effort into this series, you will miss much of its glory. You have been warned.\r\nThe synopsis on the main page will take care of the basics, but in case you need further clarification, this is not a story about a specific character. This is a story about life inthe city of Ikebukuro, Japan. There are different aspects of this city, such as it's every day school life, its gangster underground,  and the supernatural influences. The characters serve as conduits for these different aspects of the city and like a country boy entering NYC for the first time, you will be lost when you meet them. Characters you know nothing about will emerge on screen and you'll scratch your head in confusion about their significance. However, worry not, for if you focus your effort and stick with the show, the overall story will come together in order to paint a grand picture of a living breathing city. There is no good or bad to the conflicts of this anime. There are only conflicts of ideals, of morals. Durarara tells a mature story that incorporates a variety of characters and challenges you to put it together. \\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nThe art of the series is stylized and smooth. Animations are fluid as a whole and the characters look appealing, with their designs matching their personalities perfectly. The urban landscape is portrayed with great detail as well.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nThe music is a great part of the series. The openings are magnificent, with both songs capturing the feeling the series: epicness. The endings also tie up each episode nicely. The BGM, great as well! The VAs for the sub are top-notch. I can't really speak for the dub.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nThe characters are the selling point for the series. I won't go into them too much to avoid spoilers and the like, but I will say that while the majority of the characters fill their roles very well, the weakest seems to be the three schoolmates, who could be called the protagonists if your were to look at it that way. Looking back, their actions are to be expected, but don't be shocked when they tend to dwell on certain things and slow down plot progress. Some of their scenes rob the show of its allure with their whininess. Keep in mind that such times are rare, but they happen. \\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nNow, with all this great quality, how is my enjoyment an 8? Doesn't make any sense, right? Well, its because I watched this series the wrong way. This is a series that deserves multiple re-watches to pick up all the subtle hints, character development and themes. I watched it in short bursts, but the time between the bursts was much too long. You can't really watched this and take in all the info in just one sitting, but if you wait about 6 months between 6 episode bursts, that's simply too long and it causes the entire thing to suffer.  However, if you choose to ignore my advice, that's your choice.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nOverall, this is an excellent series. It's not for the faint of heart, but if you put in the effort, you will love this series.",

            "content": "Durarara!! impressed me with its clean cut art, dynamic characters and intricate plot. Although at some points, you question why we are being shown a certain scene or hearing a certain conversation, there is always an underlying reason for it: whether it be to further the plot or enhance the character development.\r\nBy far, my favorite part of this series was the characters. At the beginning, so many characters are shown to us and it seems like an impossible task to remember them all. However, every character plays some role in the story, and you never forget them; or at least I didn't. The characters areall unique, but not so unique that they are out of this world (I'm talking about pink, green or blue hair). Really, where Durarara!! shines is its ability to inspire feeling for the common person, not some fantasy hero.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were sharp. Whether it be the screaming of Celty's 'horse' or the chanting of a crowd, you heard and saw everything you needed to. Definitely the style is one of the most interesting one's out there. I love how unimportant people on the street would always be greyed out, to allow you to focus on the scene.\\n\\n\r\nDurarara!!'s seemingly unrelated characters and plots feel so confusing at the start that it is terribly difficult to predict how characters will interact with each other. Of course, when it actually happens in front of you, you realize what a masterpiece this anime really is. You have to give credit for the immense thought and effort required to piece the story together, from the standpoint of so many different characters. I found the ending a little dry, but it did nothing to spoil the intricate harmony between plot, characters and conflict.",

            "content": "This DRRR!! review will be written largely based on my personal afterthoughts after finishing this anime, and also some advises for those who wanted to check out this anime.\r\nBeing the #84 anime on MAL, and a persistent recommendation from my imouto herself, I had very high expectations for DRRR!!, unfortunately, that was the ultimate downfall between the 'bittersweet' romance between me and DRRR!!\r\nFor starters, DRRR!! spent the first 7 episodes depicting only about the introduction of characters and the setting, and the story was a standstill. To attempt such a daring feat, DRRR!! must have a very interesting setting to boot, right? I dunno aboutthat, though, does modern Japan sounds interesting to you?\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the characters? Take my advice, and focus on only 6 characters: Celty, Izaya, Shizuo forms 1 group, while Mikado, Kida and Anri forms the other group. Ignore the rest, so that you can focus on their individual developments, which is good, but is also the obscure highlight of the show. Why obscure? As DRRR!! bombards you with another 15 or so characters and most of them act as if they are also main characters, but in actuality, they aren't, they are just sidekicks and sub characters that are trying to distract you, don't let them succeed. \\n\\n\r\nThere are 4 arcs in DRRR!! The first arc, the introductory arc, is the lowest point of the show, as it was the bitter medicine of the show for me, turning my tongue so bitter that the remaining 3 arcs lost any sweetness they had. I am sorry to say this but in my opinion the show would be much better should episode 8 became the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe 2nd arc, the headless rider arc, has a decent degree of mystery and suspense to it, and probably the best solution to end the arc. However, nothing much changes as an aftermath.\\n\\n\r\nThe 3rd arc, the slasher arc, is terrifying and bloody, but the resolution was too short, too abrupt, and cut off any steam I had built myself upon this arc. This arc was actually good buildup for the last arc.\\n\\n\r\nWhat about the last arc? I call it the misunderstanding arc, in which did a great job linking all our 6 main characters together, and it had a very good buildup, but then, what happened? The show pulled off a cheapskate resolution which left me largely disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nIn truth, when I finished watching the 7th episode, I asked myself a question, \"why am I still watching this?\". I believe this was the absolute flaw of DRRR!!, it has a weak introduction, and is heavily character driven. So if you want to watch this series, better find yourself a character or two that you are very interested on, and stick to them as your motivations to finish this show. I didn\u2019t, as initially I did not know who I should focus, and when I realized that, it was all too late. In the end, I found myself turbo-ing through the show, skipping parts that I don't find interesting, as the entire show had already turned stale, and don't ask me to rewatch this.\\n\\n\r\nOne noteworthy thing about this show is that it revolves around the theme \"love\", in which was severely abused to many extends, to some point, absurd (I won't spoil it, *evil laugh*). Be sure to stick this around your head when you watch this anime, as it was repeated many, many times, and is the ultimate motive force for most of the characters' actions. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR; if you are interested in DRRR!! Be sure to remember these advices:\\n\r\n- Don't have your expectations too high.\\n\r\n- Focus only on Celty, Izaya, Shizuo, Mikado, Kida and Anri.\\n\r\n- Find a character you really like and stick to him/her.\\n\r\n- Remember that love is the motivation to everything.\\n\r\n- Don\u2019t expect any large changes except for character development.\\n\r\n- Tons of patience.\\n",

We have a Yandere,Bro-con,Stalker,Four-eyes chick with huge breast,\\n\r\nOtaku and a headless chick....We had a collection of wonderful girls here in Durarara but the disappointment part is that\\n\r\nthey all ended up with unworthy guys...the only deserving guy to have a chick are Shizuo and Izaya but\\n\r\nboth of them don't have interest in chicks WTF!!! (maybe the writers didn't want that. \"LAME\" )...\\n\\n\r\nThey should do a love triangle with ShizuoXCeltyXIzaya\\n\r\nthat will be so awesome BUT NOOOO,.,.,.,,.,.,.,. Celty is being paired to a guy name Shinra a four-eyed dude that shouldn't be in the show at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is nothing new I've seen it before but there's something in Durarara that you won't see in everyday anime. 'Cause\\n\r\nin Durarara different characters are being focus in every episode.... meaning every episode we get to see different story about\\n\r\nother characters and the downside of this in Durarara the supporting cast are more interesting than the actual main characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut it's never too late 'cause Durarara will be having a season 2 maybe Shizuo,Celty and Izaya will be having more screen time.\\n\r\nAnd there love triangle will begin in Season 2 I hope so if not F*** this anime ---Just joking guys.\\n\r\nI Wish Vorona will be in season 2 so that Shizuo will be having a partner a love partner i mean.\\n\\n\r\n(by the way i still don't know if ShizuoxVorona are like that\"love Couple\" maybe a hint of there romance will be great in season 2, I know that they are in love&hate relationship).....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: SHIZUO (Stealing HARVARD) should steal Celty from Shinra 'Cause Shinra SUCKS!!! and SHIZUO ROCKS!!!",

Special mention for BlackRider, Shizuo and Kida that are really good characters. They do carry the show.\r\nBut then, unfortunately, everything collapse for the third and final arc.\r\nIt's almost as if the scriptwriter changed and didn't know the show.\r\nCharacters totally lose common sense, the story goes on without ANY logic. \r\nI still recommend this anime, but Iwill advice you to stop at episode 16. Really. There's nothing more beyond except frustration to see such a good show go to waste.\\n\\n",

I loved its nights, its moon, its cops, its gangs, its sushi, its monsters, everything.\r\nIf I have to say one word about Durarara, then it would definitely be \"UNIQUE\". It's almost a new genre. It's spice of life in an action packed city. It has fights, spirits, gangs, human trafficers. Still everything seems normal. That's exactly how I felt.\r\nIt's a show where every character is a main character. This part is the best.You can pick any character as your protagonist and I assure you - You won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n25 episodes. Each 25 minutes. But I finished it in one go! Time literally flew by and the entrancement of Ikebukoro made me disappear into that dreamy city.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are bored of all the stereotypical genres, then Durarara will be a fine tonic.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe story is well developed without any rushing. The story is intriguing. No matter how hard I try, I can't find a flaw.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThis is the first time I loved an anime because of its characters. Every single character is worth the spotlight. I can't say all of them were developed well, but every one is interesting, even the villains!\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe entrancement Durarara left on me, is all because of the art. I loved the nights so much, the moon, the way Celty's bike rushed through the streets.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe opening and the ending themes were superb. The background music didn't fail to do its job.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nDid I left anything to say how fun it was?\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe anime is definitely worth 10 out of 10. MAL ratings are shit. So, don't let it bother you. Watch this anime and I bet you'll cherish the time you spent watching it.",

            "content": "Where do I start. People seem to hate every anime that garners mass appeal, even admitting you like a show others don\u2019t like can cause people to jump down your throat, these people don\u2019t want to associate themselves with casual anime fans because they don\u2019t want the novalty of anime to go away, sadly this is the reason people stay away from anime, because they feel as if the community is toxic. However, over the years I\u2019ve seen more and more people start watching anime and one of the shows I always recommend to people to start with is durarara.\r\nThis show is for everyone. Thecharacters are magnificent, they develop themselves so smoothly, nobody\u2019s going to like all the characters because that\u2019s the point, you come across hundreds of people everyday and you don\u2019t know anything regarding them, all the deep emotional cuts, baggage, and turmoil they\u2019ve been through is invisible to you. This leads them to have different outlooks on life and some might go against everything you stand for, therefore you\u2019re most likely not going to enjoy being with that person, but sometimes different outlooks can help cover those flaws, and emotional wounds you accumulate throughout your life. And that\u2019s what durarara is about, the families you create throughout your life. Whether you\u2019re an immigrant trying your best to fit in, or you just moved to a big city, or looking for love, or even going through something like depression you will survive as long as you find common ground with the people you love. \\n\\n\r\nMany people complain about how durararas story is lacking, and I agree. However, durarara is about the progression of its characters stories and not the common evil facing them, sometimes the stories of characters are so enthralling that you find yourself lost in a fictional world, and that you are living as one of them, and this is the case in durarara because although the main characters all have deep secrets they do not share with many they are still living a life very similar to our everyday life. The issues they face are metaphoric for the problems life throws at you, and how it can disturb the routine that you\u2019re so used to. For example Celtys main struggle is moving on from the past, she fears that what she has done may come back and haunt her and her loved ones, so as Celtys story progresses we see how she learns to live with that burden on her shoulder, and how her past does not define her. All of this is done so masterfully and naturally that you connect with the characters on a personal level. For me I found myself connecting with Simon the most, coming to a country you\u2019re not familiar with, where the people don\u2019t speak your native languages while simultaneously trying your best to assimilate is difficult but it has to be done otherwise you will be alone. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound is amazing. Every character has there own unique soundtrack and animation styles which helps build on the already great characters design and helps you get into the mind of these fictional characters and to further push the idea that everyone is different and that\u2019s why we form connections. There not much to say other than it\u2019s percect.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day If you enjoy something that\u2019s because you feel personally drawn towards it, and if someone else doesn\u2019t, there is no reason to attack them, everyone is different and you can\u2019t change people\u2019s feelings towards somethings easily and that\u2019s a life lesson you will be forced to realized.",

I would've rated this a 10/10 before the last 12 episodes ruined it for me. Just do yourself a favor and stop after the first 12. \r\nIf you feel obligated to watch the next 12 episodes be prepared for a series of ridiculous coincidences (yes, more ridiculous than they already were), character inconsistency, forced writing, and also a completely unnecessary narrator thatonly narrates the things that happen to the least interesting character the show has to offer. I really wish the show didn't have Ahnri as a character.",

They actually do a pretty nice job in explaining the back story and all that...But patience is required for sure because you won\u2019t be able to gather much from the very first few episodes.\r\nThe anime is hilarious at times, weird at times and then suddenly serious at times. \r\nThe first half of it had me laughing a lot but the second half was quite serious.\r\nI swear at timesthis anime had me thinking \u2018Just what am I watching and why am I watching this\u2019 hahaha yet I kept watching one after the another because every episode left me curious about what happens next.\\n\r\nTrust me, there are lots of twists and turns and things may go over your head but if you look carefully, everything\u2019s pieced together pretty nicely.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I like about it is that it doesn\u2019t have a particular main character, everyone is a main character in themselves and everyone gets their own share of screen time \\n\r\nAlso everyone is directly or indirectly connected with each other by a thread of a common storyline so incase you heard that it doesn\u2019t have a plot....Well, it clearly does..\\n\r\nBut yeah it doesn\u2019t have a \u2018concrete\u2019 storyline I guess? Well I\u2019ve just seen the first season as of now so can\u2019t really say about that...\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the opening and ending songs are great! The transitions in opening songs depict the connections of characters that I\u2019m talking about, very nicely!\\n\r\nSo do give it a try~!\\n\\n\r\nCan\u2019t wait to watch other seasons ^^\\n",

            "content": "-Story-\r\nA normal setting with a plot that\u2019s a little difficult to integrate yourself into.  The tension that moves the storyline seems unrealistic and over-dramatic. The nuances of magical realism (such as Celty Sturluson and Saika) appear mismatched in this modern setting due to poor plot execution partnered with a rather terrifying showcase of horrible relationships.  \r\nWhat really really puts me off is how this anime portrays relationships. It shows you what happens if you miscommunicate, manipulate, lie, or omit the truth on a horrifying, super-dramatic, and lightly supernaturally-induce scale.  Like a chunk of the plot could have been unraveled entirely if acertain someone just told their friends the truth.  Like, seriously.  A sentence would have done it.  A text.  5 minutes of the character's time.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, however, there are times when the storyline and the plot shines.  I find the pacing very well done and I very much like how well-integrated the multiple storylines are.  Still, I feel a majority of the anime is tedious.\\n\\n\r\n-Art-\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite good.  Very fluid.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\\n\r\nI would really recommend the Japanese-With-English-Subs version.  Partly because Izaya's low alto voice doesn't translate very well in the English Dub.  The English voice actor went for a more husky, relaxed sigh, and I personally preferred the low, lilting taunt the Japanese voice actor does.  \\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\\n\r\nHorrible relationships aside, I find the characters themselves quite interesting.  Celty is so ironically down-to-earth.  Masaomi is awesome.  Shizuo is hilarious.  Mikado's character growth is excellent throughout the series considering.  The characterization doesn't seem too far-fetched and the characters themselves are very well-presented.  Like, everything you need to know about Izaya's personality is showcased in the second episode.  You know exactly what kind of person he is and he is an horrible, despicable, human being (and I love him.)  \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character is Izaya Orihara, as his introduction into the plot sets up the theme of the entire series.  As Izaya says: \"\"Everyone lies, everyone hides things, no one goes through this life completely honest.\"   Izaya also says one of my most favorite lines in the series: \"Your guilt will be your past and that will be your god.\"  Love it.",

I didn't enjoy the endings as much as I enjoyed the openings butthey perfectly fit the animes nature.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:(10/10)\\n\r\nI think this is the most amazing part about this anime. There is looots of characters and they never disappear. The producer uses his characters like an expert puppetmaster and Im really amazed by that. The first 10 episodes of this anime is mostly about introducing the characters to the viewer and after episode 10 the real show starts with all the characters affecting each other somehow!\\n\\n\r\nMy Personal Enjoyment:(10/10)\\n\r\nTotally amazing! Lots of great characters, nice music and exciting plot twists.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(10/10)\\n",

Durarara!! hasn't really one story what it is following, It's just a certain city with certain people and a couple of strange happenings in it. \r\nWhen I'm writing it, the anime has 17  of the 24 episodes. To me the anime is like a puzzle, you see a certain happening but later you see a lost part of the happening. Like a girl who runs into someone and runs away.\r\n10 episodes later: The same girl tries to escape from a girl on a motorcycle, runs into someone and got rescued by him. Same happening, different story.\r\nThe characters are alldifferent, and some characters are so damn epic you have to love them. The anime has a lot of twists and cliffhangers what makes you addictive to it.",

            "content": "These are my Reviews if they're helpful great, if not, that's great too. I am NOT adept at writing/typing this is merely a contribution to the site. I assume the reader has finished the show.\r\nStory\r\nDurarara!! from the beginning doesn't really have nor does it ever develop a single focal point to drive the story. Their are so many different elements and possibilities as the show progresses that it almost feels \"safe\" (someone has to like it). Coupled with the somewhat slow pace it felt to me as if Durarara lacked direction. Hell we got street gangs, school kids (surprise!!) and a damn dullahan. I'll stoptheir before I start dropping spoilers. Towards the finale even though still nothing was answered you see that somehow their is a plan to all this mayhem. It just surprised me how successful they were interweaving all the different elements, even if they still were a little thin. Despite minor frustrations I'm looking forward to the continuation with season 2 so they can build on this web they've created.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is not stellar by any means and only details what's important in each scene, for example bystanders will not be colored in or the backgrounds are not moving at all. They implement this conservative style very well and do great work with their budget. The City looks great at night and their are sporadic moments the animation is amazing. Aside from the dullahan, supernatural elements look fantastic. Some moments like chatting on their computers for example just felt like another way to cut a corner, even though their is a purpose behind it. However in this situation due to the intended audience I'll give it higher remarks for creativity.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nSo many characters are introduced in the first few episodes you have to like at least one right? Not in my case. The character development, if anything, was difficult to make connections with because they were not giving enough time to a single character. A couple of them frustrated me, had cheesy backgrounds or was just plain boring. Some of the relationships had me going wtf? So every-time I seen them I turned off half my brain. All the characters are light hearted on the outside, but everyone has secrets not even the closest person to them knows. But somehow in the end I accepted all these schizophrenic characters and enjoyed in hindsight. One in particular was just badass.. you either know or will know him.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thought\\n\\n\r\nDurarara!! was a interesting experience that almost got dropped numerous times in the beginning. Through all the hype I was passing it off as another fanboy attractive show. It may still be that but it has it's own unorganized charm that reveals itself in the later episodes. Everything seems cluttered but it's that way for a reason, hopefully they don't make a fool out of me in Season 2. If anything look at this as the hook to what's coming. If your easily amused you'll love it, if not, like me have a little patience and watch with no expectations.",

When i watched the first Episode , i felt like \"Blah its one of those seinen type supernatural anime\" but some how i continued watching it . And after i watched 8 more episodes , it made me exited & enjoyed .\r\nI enjoyed every moment of this anime especially with Izaya and Shizuo . Other thing i liked about this anime is Characters . With unique characteristics andability they wont make you bore . You can also learn some thing about Ikebukuro , Shibuya and Shinjiki from this anime cos mostly they animated the original ikebukuro in this anime to make it better , dont think it is real ikebukuro , but hey anything is possible . Be sure to watch this anime , you wont regret it and i am pretty sure there will be a second season too .\\n\\n\r\nOh yeah and you can also Read the Novel and the Manga ^^ \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading .......",

Indeed, it's both those things, but gosh darn it, dad, it's ART.  And it's good art: a welcome novelistic approach to televised anime (it's the \"The Wire\" of its genre) and a postmodern melange of fantasy and realism, eternal myth and technological ephemera, that has the good sense to ground its convoluted narrative in well-drawn emotions.  It also helps that it shows you frequent glimmers ofstunning beauty, eroticism, and humour.  It's the kind of thing that's life-altering for some, and turns others on to reading Foucault and Paul Auster novels.  It may not age well, but for now, \"Durarara!!\" is about as literate and exhilarating as popular art can get.",

I just recently saw Baccano!, but what bothers me is that it's told the same way, just substitute the characters and scenarios and drag it on about twice out.\r\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed DRRR thoroughly; most of the characters were fun to watch, Izaya and Shizuo made the series tons of fun for me, but the main three character annoyed me quite a bit up until close to the end of the series.  To have to put up with annoying characters with such irritating faults for 16+ episodes without understanding (or much lessgiving me a reason to care) them fully until that point is wasted potential.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a unique storytelling technique but don't repeat the exact same formula for a completely different series.  Heck, even the intros are the same style without the catchy Paradise Lunch.\\n\\n\r\nI think the most fun otherwise I had was trying to identify the different anime series that were given shameless plugs from Brain's Base (i.e. Baccano!, Darker Than Black, Spice and Wolf, etc).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, very enjoyable series and I'd recommend this much more than I would Baccano!, but seeing both got me annoyed that the same formula is used here too and I often found myself left hanging.

            "content": "[NO SPOILERS]\r\nDurarara!! is a very good anime for those who like anime with hints of mystery, romance, and the occult. However, Durarara!! does not match up with its predecessor Baccano!!, for several reasons.\r\n[STORY]\r\nThe story of durarara is a rather interesting concept. Basically, it's the coming together of several small happenings in a large, dark, and secretive city. I gave the story an 8 for a simple reason: the ending of durarara!! was downright terrible. The ending blew off almost all my hopes and basically crushed all the awesomeness that was building up as the anime progressed. This is one of the reasons why Baccano!! isbetter, baccano was consistent.\\n\\n\r\n[ART]\\n\r\nThe art was okay, I personally didn't understand why everyone thought anji was cute, she was downright ugly compared to other female mains from other anime. (Baccano's art trumps durarara's, although they're quite similar)\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND]\\n\r\nThe sound was just amazing. Durarara's OPs were by far 2 of the best OPs I've ever heard. The first ED was okay, the second ED was quite good.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\nDurarara!! had amazing characters, on par with even baccano. However, unlike baccano, the character depth was uneven. Still, durarara did well with orihara izaya and shizuo.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\nI enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\nOverall, Durarara's great, but don't get your hopes up for the ending!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story- This one gave me trouble to rate. Durarara's story is one of the most amazing story that I never seen. Usually, war clan or whatsoever don't really interest me for the sole reason of having bad/clich\u00e9 ending. The 'good' side always winning or simply everyone realizing at the end that fighting is utterly useless, for example. Though, in the Durarara universe, it's different. We assist to some realistic war clan content who's being mixed up with normal teenagers' life AND fantasy. All of these elements without doing 'too much'. I feared at the beginning that this would become a huge mess by bringing allsort of superpowers, big huge fights that wouldn't make any sense and etc. however, when seeing the whole picture, everything seems coherent, well thought and context-fitting. Which I love. Also, the cliffchanger and cliffhanger. Dang it. I loved them. Excluding the main 'goal' of the manga, there was all sort of 'mini-mysteries' that us, the spectators AND the characters had the discover (if you understand what I mean). To make it brief, adding to the main story, we had a lot of smaller 'secrets' in the plot. At some times, it was sure confusing (which I dare to say that was one of my less favorite point) however I had a great time stressing out to guess.\\n\\n\r\nArt- Quite simplistic, no detail, \u00e0 la Shonen and etc. I don't really have something to say about this. BUT I must say that I loved the scenes were only the'main characters were 'colored' and the background characters, who share no connections with the plot were all in 'gray', just as if they were 'shadows'. Those who watched the anime know what I mean by this little effect ;) \\n\\n\r\nSounds- As for the openings, for one of the rarest time, I preferred the animation over the songs. Weird, isn't it? It's only a matter of taste, so I won,t write about this however, as for the ending... Anyone who still hasn't watched it, go and do it! 'Trust me' is one of my favorite song and I just love this 'pyramid of characters' for the animation. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- I first thought of doing something, a little text for each of the characters, but this will never end. Let's make it short then: Durarara has the most awesome characters that I never see. No stereotype,  if yes, this mean you didn't watch fully the anime and to a certain point, all the characters are enjoyable and for god sake! no annoying girls. There's a HUGE variety of personality, of backgrounds and even if some are more here for a comical relief, we love them anyway. At some times, you'll maybe want for the anime to focus more on a certain character (since each episode have a different narrator and etc.) however, sadly, there isn't. My sole problem with this is the fact that in the anime, there's so many characters and we so want to 'see' each of them that after some few episodes, it's become boring. Because the plot isn't advancing. I won't write more than this or else: I'll spoil.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I like it. But nothing more than this. The ANIME had a lot of qualities, but its default wasted it all. On a side, there's some few bad points that made me appreciate the original version (the light novels... because yes: Durarara is a novel and not a Manga!) than the anime or the Manga adaptation. First, the focus on 'every characters' life'. While 'useless speech about someone's past/random or past events/information about a certain character is interesting in a book, it isn't in an anime. These long scenes bore me out and frankly, knowing that a single tome took 12-13 episodes for the adaption... I can understand why. Second, the non-respect of the time-line of the story. Example: Shizuo throw the garbage can when Mikado is at his second meeting with him and not his first.  Another example: we don't see the &#?@* scene where Izaya is 'introduced'. We replaced it by a passage where he meets with 'Miss Magenta' and toy with her. Trust me: the karaoke psychopath moment is way much better. It may be some tiny little details, but trust me: the tale is way more great the original way.\\n\\n\r\nWord of the end: watch the anime, fangirl/boy about it then read the novel fangirl/boy even MORE about it. *CoughcoughIhavesomesitethattranslate\\n\r\nthenovelsundermyhandifyouwantcoughcough*",

            "content": "Durarara!! is the second animated offering from creator Ryohgo Narita, director Omori Takahiro , and animation studio Brains Base. Like its predecessor Baccano, Durarara is a  crazy clusterfuck of a thrill ride. It is loud, chaotic, and just a lot of fun. However, unlike Baccano, Durarara slows down to explore some of the characters; ultimately causing some complications the former did not suffer from. Still, this show is far too enjoyable to pass up.\r\nLike Baccano, Durarara centers around underworld dealings, but this time taking place in modern day Japan rather than 1930s America. More specifically in the Ikebukuro district of Tokyo; where high schoolstudent Mikado Ryugamine has just arrived, looking forward to meeting his childhood friend, Masaomi Kida, and starting a new life of excitement. And what excitement Ikebukuro has to offer... rival color gangs who fight turf wars in the streets; people with impossible strength; mythical beings; a colorless gang known only as the \"Dollars\". Something big is about to happen in Ikebukuro, and unbenounced to Mikado, he is right in the middle of it.\\n\\n\r\nOmori Takahiro directs Durarara in a style akin to a Guy Ritche film; grimy, frenetic, and gleefully twisted. The show just radiates with off-key energy and keeps the viewer interested in the winding plot. The backgrounds do a great job in depicting the busy, crowed and chaotic streets and alleys of Ikebukuro. Character designs are stylish, yet at times also messy, which adds to the grittiness of the show. Likewise, the animation is mostly fluid with moments of jerkiness which Takahiro uses accentuate the edgy atmosphere. One very noticeable interesting stylistic touch is that only the characters in the spotlight get detailed designs, with the passing crowds being featureless. The end result is a unique look which embodies the show's frenetic energy.\\n\\n\r\nDurarara's story is twisting and piecemeal; gradually revealing the secrets of Ikebukuro and its residents through connecting story arcs. A lot of time is spent developing the story's whacked-out version of Tokyo, showing many things which are explored and explained later. The world of Durarara is vast and filled which distinctive characters and wild happenings, all of which fit together very well. The story arcs build on each other, creating an intricate web of events and sub-plots which keeps the viewership eager to see what happens next. Each arc is entertaining and creative on there own right.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this is not to say the writing in Durarara is spotless. In fact, there is a huge number of plot contrivances. While most of the shows sub-plots are interesting, there is a good number which are not. Some are a bit to farfetched to take seriously, or at least not completely. There are also several plot treads which are simply left hanging, or barely even explored, which might leave some unsatisfied. Despite these flaws, Durarara works through charismatic characters, shifting narrative, and off-key charm.\\n\\n\r\nDurarara is a prime example of a show having too many characters. The cast for this show is huge and diverse; highlights include: a crooked information dealer, a bodyguard with superhuman strength, a crazy doctor, and a headless transporter. And that is just the tip of the iceberg. Each character is interesting or likeable in their own way, down to the bit players, and the wide array of personality offers a lot to like. The flip-side of this is that there are so many characters that it is impossible to develop them all. Majority of the cast comes off as highly likeable with the complexity of dixie cups; handy plot devises with little actual depth to offer.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the development goes to Mikado and his two schoolyard friends, Masaomi and Anri. On the surface all three look like normal high school student, however, have well kept secrets which they are hidden from each other (and the viewer in the beginning of the series). Most of the latter part of Durarara is focused on the friendship of these three and the repercussions their secret lives have on it, which makes for a strong final arc. However, there is a certain dissatisfaction in seeing the vast majority of characters get minimal character development. Especially since there are some characters which are more interesting then the trio of high school students (not to say they are uninteresting), yet do not get as much screen time. Regardless, the character development that is there is really quite good, and the likeability of the cast more or less paves over the lack of development.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, for whatever flaws it may have, Durarara is definitely worth its time. Though it might not live up to its older cousin Baccano (which it will inevitably be compared to), the show is wildly entertaining. It provides a gigantic, likeable cast, and a well realized world which is as creative as it is crazy. It is exciting, funny, and undeniably intriguing.",

I haven't watched many of it's genre before and sorry if this may be unhelpful babbling but I'm selfishly using this chance to review so that I can ravve.\r\nAnyway, as I've said, I haven't watched many of this genre before, but in this anime I've found for the first time, such a deliciously black humour. It's interwoven through the storytelling, the portrayal of the characters and makes the characters not just slap you in the face with their sudden and clear-cut existence, but gives away their character slowly and only when it's relevant.\r\nThe art is fine too, it suitsthe mood of the series very well and looks sort of like samurai champloo, thinking about it now - or maybe that's just becuase of the way the ending song  looks.\\n\\n\r\nAhaha, sorry for being such a gusher. This doesn't make sense at all. But do watch it! It's very very good :)",

            "content": "Personal Comment: \r\n- This anime is probably one of the best anime I have seen in my whole life, everything about it from 'bad guys' to 'good guys' trying to fight each other from the people behind the scene. This anime is amazing because there are so much that you wouldn't suspect, though I did not give it 10/10 simply because I just wanted it to have more episodes. If I were to be biased this anime is 'perfect' not that most of you guys would agree but this anime can really but you at the edge of your seat. The anime gives a lotof twist and turns, from bad to worse which is soo entertaining because you are just dying to see what will happen next. Izaya (the main mastermind of... everything) is just so scary that I actually detest the guy though  he doesn't he really exist (*.*), but surely you guys are thinking that I'm taking that guy tooo seriously but yeah if you have seen the anime then you can understand why I'm like this, but if you have not seen this anime then it's a \"Must Watch\" because I garuntee that you'll enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10 \\n\r\n- This anime's story is... to put it simple - perfect. If your wondering why, it's because of most of all the chair-edging scenes such as... the scene of all three heroin's fnding about the truth about each other about episodes 23-24. The story is well constructed, and it does not leave with thoughts like \"where did guy come from\" or \"what happened to ... \" because episodes 1-5 show's a great demonstration of showing what  happened from different prespective's of each character, therefore making it interesting and it allows that auidience to take interest in other characters rather then just always seeing the main heroins. Shizua and Izaya, the two overpowered 'Dudes' show great interesting characterisation, because not only they are from the same gang \"dollars\" but they try to kill each other everytime they see each other, but it's mostly Shizua doing all the chasing. This creates some kind of comic relief because this shows to the audience that if these two make any encounter, it's automatic that something good or bad will happen and that Shizua seems to have \"gay feelings\" for Izaya because he just won't leave him alone... But yeah overall the different gangs \"yellow scarfs\" , \"blue squares\" and \"Dollars\" are interesting gangs because they shows different kinds of reactions towards society, 'Blues' - violent; \"yellows\" - Average gang (just hanging out) and \"Dollars\" - a bunch of people who made a group.. (sooo like a youth group?) who do good things... (mostly). \\n\r\nLastly celty (the rider) was an interesting character on this anime, because she gave a lot of hints which makes her and interesting character which made the story more interesting, because she... is... uhh... funny?  yet... serious... the fact that she's so intimidating but shes so 'girly' (sorry if I sounded sexist) makes an interesting character to have in the story, and the fact that they gave a little bit of her history made it easier for us audience to understand her. I didn't want to go over the story too much, because it might spoil it for some people who hasn't watched it.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\n- The art was pretty good, the way everyone was drawn was pretty amazing, though unlike most anime they don't have any scenes which they turn into this \"chibi-like\" character to shows there emotions of, happy, shy, angry etc... but I'm not much of a fan of those anyways. The arts of the motor bike, shadows... and evil 'things' were very well made, and it wasn't a predictable of what might they look like. Furthermore it's very unique of what they wear, like Shinra's father (a old dude, that wears a gas mask?!) was rather funny because he wasn't really that important in the story but the way he acted fitted perfectly to what he wore. on the other hand, the fact that celty is wearing all black biker clothing, but a cat like helment totally confuses you if shes really a grim ripper or a \"dullahan\" (a fallen valkyire). Most of the art were pretty believable because everything seemed to really fit in the anime, if your wondering what I mean, the scenary of what's happening around the anime, \"a run-down area\" fit's perfectly of an anime filled with gangs. Furthermore they make it seem more realistic by making some character's live in a run-down area, or place because unlike some anime's, some have a run-down place but for some reason they have a super clean room and a perfectly tidy enviroment for them to live in. But yeah the art is amazing, but if your wondering why I didn't make it 9 or 10/10 because the fact that it's got high school students wasn't really anything new, therefore it wasn't interesting unlike the other characters...\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\n- This... I don't know why they have this in the \"reviewing\" but... the sound is great? I guess, but the sound actually depends on where and what you watch it. But then again they might be talking about the sound of the characters... and sound effects? I don't have much for this... because I didn't really focus on sounds... but straight to the point \\n\\n\r\njapanese Version - I didn't watch the Jp version therefore I do not know if the Jp dubbing is good.\\n\\n\r\nEnglish Version - The dubbing was fantasric, everything fit's perfectly from the description of the character.\\n\\n\r\nEffects - The effects were alright, not amazing but average. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10 \\n\r\nThe characters were all amazing and fun to watch, however some did not have as much attention unlike the others, such as the police which celty is extremely scared of. He made an appearance as one of the new cops chasing after celty which shown just how powerful a cop can really be, however after that episode, we never seen him again, or more preferable just not noticed. The only time I really notice that cop, is when celty panics or the point of view focuses on this special cop. Most of the characters, were interesting ranging from: \\n\\n\r\nCelty: a 'Black Rider', 'Dullahan', 'Grim reaper' \\n\r\n- A rider which doesn't have head, with black shadow thingies coming out of her neck, and a motorbike which makes horse sounds, make her one of the wierdest but interesting character. Oh and she's afraid of aliens... which is pretty funny because she doesn't have a head...\\n\\n\r\nShizuo: a 'bar-tender', 'Strongest man in Ikubukuro',\\n\r\n- An Over powered dude, which get's pissed so easily, call him stupid and he'll send you flying 500m in the air. He apparantly doesn't like violence, which is hard to believe because everything single episode we see him or  even a glimpse of him, something or someone is flying or broken. His blue glasses make's him somewhat \"awesome\" and he has gay feelings for Izaya (that's what I thnk)\\n\\n\r\nIzaya: a 'informer'... 'King'\\n\r\n- He Manipulates everyone and everything as he pleases, he is smart and he has commando like skills to jump long distances and has great accuracy with his knifes. He wears blackish clothing and laughs crazily or act's crazy from time to time, he doesn't seem to understand \"fear\" and he doesn't care if his about to die, he is always calm in any kind of situation. He is able to gain trust from people, and he just manipulate's in doing his dirty work, he feels \"humans\" are his sense of his entertainment, therefore he is constantly causing distress towards... Everyone.\\n\\n\r\nAnri: a 'Slasher' \\n\r\n- She is a lot alike to the main character of blood C Saya. She has big boobs, wears glasses and gives away this feeling that you shouldn't piss her off, two people like her Mikado and Masaomi. She can release saika from her right hand and once's she slashes you she can control you. She is a shy character therefore she doesn't say much from time to time, she is a skilled swordsman and doesn't seem to be intimidated from getting surrounded. She's scary.\\n\\n\r\nMasaomi: a \"leader of yellow scarfs\" \\n\r\n- he has street fighting skills, he is very flirty and he doens't care what kind of girl he flirts so long as they're cute. He switches personality depending on who his with, his a coward but conquers that at the last episodes. He doesn't specialise in any kind of weapon, so long you can hold and smash with it it's good for him. His best friend is Mikado and like's Anri.\\n\\n\r\nMikado: a \"Leader of the Dollars\" \\n\r\n- he doesn't have any kind of fighting talents nor is he extremely smart and manipulative like Izaya, but he is your average school boy. He wants his life to be adventurous and he reacts heroicly if his friend is in trouble, he also controls the entire group \"Dollars\" through a chat room. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\n- I loved this whole anime so great, enjoyed every single episode and I wish it can have more episodes. It took me 2 days to finish this anime all the episodes, you might think I'm addicted to this, but yeah it was that good I didn't want to leave my seat. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\r\n- If you haven't seen this anime, then hate me if I have spoiled it for you. If you have seen this anime, then I hope you found my review helpful. \\n\\n\r\nThank you Very much for reading this review, I hope you enjoy this anime and get addicted like I did. :D",

            "content": "Durarara!! is overall a very good series. It was one of the very animes I managed to get into in the very first episode. \r\nStory: I like the story a lot. Each episode is from a different character's viewpoint and tells a different tale from the last. The story mainly focuses on 3 average high school students and as you get farther into the show, you begin to see they aren't as average as you thought. They meet several characters along the way that either help them, fight against them, or are completely neutral. There were a lot of points in the story that youdidn't expect. The story deserves a 9/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\nAtt: The art is very unique and not like things you see in any other anime. Every background character is drawn as a gray, lifeless character, which in my opinion was a cool detail. The city itself was drawn beautifully, and all the main characters varied in design from one another. One of the characters spews dark matter from her neck, and that as well was drawn gorgeously, and did't use the same \"flicker\" pattern you see in most shows. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: There is not a whole lot to say here, but the openings and endings were awesome as hell. My only complaint is the BGM's all sounded very similar and were too loud and sometimes sounded out the characters voices. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: All characters were very unique and had hidden pasts about themselves which was great development. The three high school students seem to be the same at the beginning, but eventually grow very far apart in terms of personality and characterization. The rest of the characters are all unique and great. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The story was slow at some points and was a bit repetitive as well, but the last 6 or 7 episodes were really great and kept me interested at the very end. Because of the slowness on a few episodes, I give it a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to everyone as it is very good, except for the minor problems that I mentioned above. Thanks for reading my review of Durarara!! ^-^",

            "content": "This anime... I find it quite difficult to summarize my thoughts on this anime, as it is a show quite unlike anything else. However, I'll do my best. But first, I'd like to give a brief summary as to what this show is about, as when I was trying to decide whether to watch this show or not, I couldn't find a single synopsis/review that could do the show any justice in explaining what the hell it actually is. Note, this is partly because the show in and of itself, is told in a somewhat non-linear style, resulting in a hard-to-summarize plot, so most synopsizes(including the one provided here on the myanimelist page) just summarize the events of the first episode, in which absolutely nothing happens.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMINIMUM-SPOILER PLOT SYNOPSIS:\\n\r\nRyugamine Mikado is a shy, laid back country kid, who dreams of a \"different life\", something less \"ordinary\". So when his best friend Masaomi Kida invites him to move to the big city, he accepts with no further delay. Once he arrives in the Ikebukuro district of Tokyo, where he is to be living and attending school, he begins learning of the secrets that this town has to offer, from the \"colorless\" color gang, to the \"Black Rider\", a motorcyclist who is rumored to have no head, and occasionally shows up riding a jet-black motorbike that makes no sound. His friend also introduces him to many people around town, amongst them an information broker with a penchant for creating pain and suffering, a \"bartender\" with a short fuse who likes throwing vending machines, and a group of four friends who are lead by the fearless Dotachin. Otakus included. Elsewhere in the city, people are going missing, a girl is having suicidal thoughts, a long separated couple seems to reunite, and a creature from celtic legends who happens to be a tsundere searches for her lost memories, not to mention head. Slowly, these paths start to converge, and secrets are unveiled. What will become of the mysterious place called Ikebukuro?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPLOT: My personal score: 7   General Score: 8\\n\\n\r\nAs you may have noticed, that synopsis sounded quite scattered. That's probably because the plot to the series itself is quite scattered, and a little hard to wrap your head around. However, don't get me wrong, that's not a bad thing at all. Heck, my favorite anime is Higurashi, which is wayyyyy more scattered than this, so, yeah. Now, let me make one point quite clear, the story is separated into two parts, one part consists of the first half of the show, which is quite a bit more lighthearted, focuses on the side characters more, and exudes badassery on sooo many levels. The other half focuses more on the main three characters (or at least the two others that weren't really touched upon in the first half, and is quite a bit darker. Personally, I liked the first half quite a bit more, mainly because of the plot twists, the converging story lines, episode 7, the creepy twisted relationships of the Yagiri family, and the fact that just about every single thing about it kinda just made you want to go AWWWWWW SHIIITTT. The whole gang war factor is downplayed significantly in the first half, while most of the second half revolves around that, or at least psychological gang wars. As I said, the first half focuses much more on the side characters than the main three. Two out of the main three characters are barley touched upon in the first half, while the other of them shines near the end, and shine he does. Episode 1 focuses on Mikado and introduces most of the main cast, Episode 2 focuses on a girl who doesn't show up in the rest of the series, and introduces another supporting character, ie. not one of the main three, but still a main character, episodes 3-5 focuses on Mikado at school/Dotachin & co./Celty/Dysfunctional Yagiri family, episode 6 is Dotachin, episode 7 is Shizuo... so on and so on. As you can see, it's pretty spread out, and then the storylines all come together, and when they do, it's a big OHMYGAWDTHATWASSOFREEKINGAWESOME. The second half almost entirely focuses on Anri and Kida, and drives up the melodrama by quite a lot, considering there was none in the first half. I found that this was probably because they wanted to keep the same epic feeling, but seeing as most of the plots introduced in the first half had already connected and resolved, they had to create a different kind of suspense, so they left you with the mysterious Anri, which was actually kinda fun, and the dour Kida, who was actually kinda boring.They also precede to introduce characters that never really do anything, and unlike Simon, the big black russian sushi chef, are kinda boring and get no screentime. Honestly, if you don't mind the plot holes left at the start of the season, and want to be left with the epic feeling that it gives off, I would stop watching Durarara!! after episode 12, at least until a second season comes out or something seeing as the second half doesn't have much to offer plotwise. The badassery that was so prominent in the first season is almost not present at all, and the suspense for the most part is also gone, replaced by attempted melodrama/tragic pasts, that don't go over as well. Although, honestly, the second half is probably worth watching, unless you really don't care about undeveloped characters, and enjoyed the first season mainly for the badass plot, which, by the way, is NOT what you should mainly enjoy it for, but I'll get to that in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL PLOT COMMENTS:\\n\\n\r\nI personally found the first half that much better than the second half, although there will always be people out there who disagree with me, and really, it's still good, so be sure to watch it. The first half is much more akin to it's predecessor, Baccano!, and focuses more on suspense and the overall \"epic\" feeling, whereas the second half feels a bit more like a not quite as good retelling of Code Geass in gangland. Some people disagree with me, and like the second half more. Also, to keep from getting you really lost, at the beginning of every episode, they sum up previous important details, amongst the myriad of details you have been feed, to keep from getting you overly confused. I gave the story an overall 7, would have been better, but I felt the second half dragged it down, but overall, other people liked the second half a bit better than I did (though still agree that it wasn't as good), so I gave the general story rating an 8. Surprisingly little amount of gang violence, for a story about gang violence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: My personal score: 8    General Score: 8\\n\\n\r\nWhile I personally don't care much for the visual art in anime, and it tends to not factor much into my enjoyment of the series, I am well aware that it does matter to some people, so I'll talk. The art in this show is nothing really special, the animators occasionally gets a little lazy, but really, I found that when the art needed to be there, it really delivered. The scenes with the black bike were often quite nice to look at, and the character designs for the show were also quite beautiful. The city in the background, being a central figure, is also a scene to admire. Oh yeah, and Shizuo's fight scenes, I approve. Most people tend to agree here. This was a short enough paragraph, I have no need for overall comments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: My personal score: 8    General Score: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis is split into two parts, voice acting and soundtrack. The voice acting is nothing superb, although there were some characters that great voices, Mika and Izaya namely. Oh yeah, and for all you dubbed fans out there, I checked out the dub as well, and although I still think almost all dubs suck, save Ghibli movies, the quality of this dub was actually pretty good, relatively speaking. As for the soundtrack, the BGM was very, very, very repetitive; I swear they played the same song at the beginning of every. single. faqing. episode. However, it was still quite enjoyable. Quite a feat I think, when the show seems to have a 5 song playlist. As for the opening/endings, I am in LOVE with the first opening. I really like the way they summed important details, and integrated that INTO the theme song. That was pretty badass. I hated the other opening and both endings though. However, I'm sure many of you will feel the other way around, seeing as I have a different taste in music (I like indie rock, etc.) and hate most mainstream pop/rock, whether it be Japanese or English.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL SOUND COMMENTS:\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was okay, the BGM was quite nice, but repetitive, and I thought the first opening was awesome. Most people like the other openings/endings though. Look em up on youtube maybe.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:  Personal Score: 10    General Score: 9\\n\\n\r\nNow THIS is the reason you should be watching Durarara!! In the first episode, absolutely NOTHING happens plot wise, yet it is still quite engaging, and leaves you begging for more. Why? How? The characters. Almost every character in the series is likable, from the love/hate relationship you develop with Izaya, to the awe you feel in front of Shizuo, to how disgusted you are by the Yagiri family and their screwed up relationships, and yet how you feel strangely attracted to them at the same time. Hell, Seiji would of had his own badass moment if not for the fact that he was up against Shizuo. The headless Tsundere, the perverted underground doctor she lives with, the four musketeers, lead by the fearless Dotachin, with the Otakus and Car lover in tow, the big black russian sushi chef, they all make for great characters, whether or not they're actually important to the plot! The second episode focuses entirely on a character who makes no later appearances in the show, but is still kinda likeable, and we still suffer with her, even though she is only in one episode. Not to mention the main characters, Mikado, who shows us what badassery really means, Kida, who is a little hole of self regret, and Anri, who personally, I found was the character who was developed the best throughout the series. What the main characters are trying to say in Durarara!! , really, is that everyone has secrets, some of them might be terrible, but that shouldn't prevent their everyday lives, and everyday relationships. I found that Anri did this the best, Mikado did this pretty well, and Kida..... Oh Kida... I think we were supposed to feel bad for him sometime in the second half? I dunno. He worked as comic relief, not as tearjerker material. It might have worked if the story was written by Jun Maeda, but it wasn't, so oh well. The other characters more than made up for him. There were, however, some unfortunately introduced characters in the second half, who got close to no screen time, and were not important at all. One of those two characters was likable. Namely, Shinra's father. The cop was just dumb. And Shizuo's little brother was included in the second opening/ending, even though he got no screen time in the latter half of the show. Lord knows what they were thinking then.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL CHARACTER COMMENTS:\\n\\n\r\nA huge cast of great characters overall, although some people find the random characters from the second half a little too detracting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Personal Score: 8    General Score: 7.5\\n\\n\r\nI am going to throw this out there right away, but to enjoy this show, you have to \"get\" it. If you don't, you'll think it's stupid and pretentious. If you do, you'll relish in the character interactions, and the intertwining plot. Just try it out! At least watch the first half, and if you don't really like it, don't watch the rest. I can't really say much in this category, as I want you to form your own opinion about whether or not you think you'll enjoy the show. All I can say, is that I did! The first half of the plot was great, and the characters/character interactions throughout the entire series were great, from my opinion. Everyone was different aspects that they'll like/hate, but with this show, it doesn't hurt to give it a shot. I know some people who really hate it, and found it dumb, but just about everyone loves Shizuo, and Izaya too, although everyone agrees he deserves to die a horrible death. Also, an important note to take is that the ending doesn't offer much closure, and sets itself up for a second season, but nothing has been announced to this date, so be wary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8\\n\\n\r\nSuspense, Epic, Tragedy, Comedy, Slice-of-Life, even Romance at some points, this show tries to do it all. With a cast wide enough, it might be worth trying, but while it succeeds at some, it fails at others. This almost seems to be an experiment in storytelling. You go be a judge of that experiment; I would suggest watching this, but not going in with really high expectations, unless all that I have described sounds like your cup of tea.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTHANKS FOR READING, HOPE IT HELPED.\\n\\n\\n\r\n                                                                      -Maxtheax\\n\\n\r\n(This was not proof read, as it was too long. It might seem rambily, I am sorry for that.)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Synopsis: Ryuugamine Mikado encounters many interesting people and is soon immersed in the Ikebukuro secret and becomes part of the goings on in Ikebukuro.\r\nStory:(9/10) The story of Durarara!! is quite amazing and is set the city of Ikebukuro following the lives of many characters who are part of different gangs most notably the Dollars. The story follows Mikado and how he starts a new life in Ikebukuro and encounters new and interesting people including the black rider. The story is pretty good especially in the first 12 episodes and the remaining episodes are engaging and pretty good story wise.\r\nArt(9/10) The art is simply amazing inthis anime with all the main cast in colour whereas the background characters are in grey to really push out the main characters and where this may be considered a way to spend less money it works really well and makes the Art of Durarara!! Great. Also the Art is top notch in the actions scenes and the animation is outstanding but there are some parts where the animation is not as good as in other parts.\\n\r\nA quick mention to the openings as well as the animation is done well and like Baccano has the characters name on the screen when you see the characters, also the endings have good animation to.\\n\\n\r\nSound(10/10) The Sound is one of the high points in this anime with the background music working perfectly with the scenes and all the music interesting and enjoyable. The first opening \"Sunset of Betrayal\"by Theatre Brook  is brilliant and works well with the visuals of the first opening to. The second opening in my opinion is even better with the song  \"Complication\" by ROOKiEZ is PUNK'D and work well with the visuals as well. The ending themes are also outstanding with the first ending \"Trust Me\" by Yuya Matsushita and the second ending \"Butterfly\" by On/Off great pieces of music and I never wanted to skip either them or the openings. The English Dub for this anime is a dub that I think is quality and voice actors like Johnny Yong-Bosch playing Izaya, Crispin Freeman playing Shizuo and Patrick Seitz playing the brilliant character Simon makes this in my opinion one of the best anime dubs to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:(10/10) The characters are also a high point in this anime but do have some flaws as I think some characters should of had more screen time and be developed more. Some characters like Shinra disappear for a few episodes and his dad Shinren only appearing in minimal episodes which was a bit weird. Also I think Simon should have been involved a bit more in the whole series like he is in the final few episodes. Other than this all the characters are brilliant for Izaya(My favourite character) to Shizuo and Celty and the rest of the cast which are amazing in there own rights. Also the characters are well developed and you start to feel connected to them in some way and by the end you wish there was more.(THERE IS A SEASON 2 COMING IN JANUARY 2015) Also the rivalry between Izaya and Shizuo is a brilliant addition to the anime series as a whole. Overall the characters are outstanding and would be even better if it wasn't for the few problems I had.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:(10/10) A perfect score for enjoyment as I enjoyed the anime immensely and found it outstanding in quality and just a blast to watch:\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think that this anime is amazing and that it is an outstanding view of how anime should be made with brilliant characters, story, art and sound and I only have limited problems with this anime but it still deserves a brilliant rating. Watch this anime if you want I highly recommend this.\\n\\n\r\nMy Scores:(All categories scores added together then divided by 5 to get overall score)\\n\r\nStory:9.2\\n\r\nArt:9.5\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nCharacters:9.7\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nOverall:9.68/10\\n\r\nRecommendation: Buy it and Watch it!!\\n\\n\r\nMy scores on the Myanimelist Website Scores:\\n\r\nStory:9\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nSound:10\\n\r\nCharacters:10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10\\n\r\nOverall:10/10\\n",

In fact, the plot only really starts to piece together much later in the series. So if you're intrigued enough to be patient and stick around for long enough, you're in for a treat!\r\nThe feel of this show is really akin to being in a city. Everything's big, slightly obnoxious, but entertaining. (That's one of this series' strong points - its super colorful and funny characters.) You think you'll probably never see the same people again, but if you stickaround the city for long enough, you see familiar faces and eventually figure out what strings the whole system together. There's also a nice supernatural element to give the whole thing an extra kick.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, enjoyable - but you might not get hooked right away! (It's also a bit incomplete because the rest of the novel wasn't animated... but season 2 is coming soon!)",

            "content": "Although it seems like the story is quite tranquil and mundane at the beginning, it transcends this level as the story progresses. \r\nThe first ten or twelve episodes create a sort of buildup and introduction to quite funny and unique characters. This buildups includes the infamous headless rider, who is quite well humanized. As these different characters and motivations occur the story starts to build up. \r\nThe pacing of this show is built undo the non-linear style, which is quite unique. This allows some events to be shown out of order and can create confusion. \r\nThe story itself has quite a few fun twists andturns which allow the watcher to enjoy the ride. And that is what it is, a story that moves at a mile a minute and weaves many different plotlines, although this is not perfect. \\n\\n\r\nEven with the incredible work put into the individual stories, some of the movements are hard to believe. The ending is quite satisfying, but some moments seem unbelievable. There are also some cliche moments. \\n\\n\r\nOverall though, the story manages to weave a large amounts of plot points almost seamlessly and indulges in cliches, drama, development, and comedy. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is also good, and the background grey characters are well needed. This allows more focus on other characters, and shows their effort to not be the forgettable grey background of an ever changing city. \\n\\n\r\nIt is definitely worth a watch. Just like a rollercoaster ride, durarara has a slow buildup and a thrilling ending that you don't want to end.",

Despite how they go through their daily lives are different, they converge to a point that we do not expect. This element that makes this story is unique. Why I rated 9? It is due to its slow-paced beginning. But I promised you that it is exciting after a several episodes\r\nCHARACTER-10/10: The characters development is beautiful because the development of every character is divided fairly,until that we are kind of confused know who is the main character in this story.

            "content": "First of all, the Anime is based on a light novel with the same name by Narita Ryogo. In the Anime you might see some hints to his other work (Baccano!). For example 2 characters of Baccano! appear in one of the episodes or that the password for the hompage of the Dollars gang is Baccano. There are a lot of other Anime and whatnot shown in the Anime as well. You may think of it as camouflaged advertising but it's done so openly and in a \"charming\" way that it doesn't hurt the Anime at all.\r\nThe story takes place in Ikebukuro which is inTokyo and surrounds the headless horseman who is searching for it's head. So far, so simple. The first episode migtht seem a bit boring but it's simply the calm before the storm and then events happen and it gets messy. It's not a bad thing though. It keeps it interesting and after a while everything comes together and makes sense again. I am not that much into comedy but here it just fits the whole thing so good, it makes the Anime even better. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters: each one will blow your mind in one way or another and most of the time you really can't judge a book by it's cover. All of them will go above and beyond your expectations. Lets just take Orihara Izaya as an example. At first glance he is that intelligent bishounen that doesn't seem strong at all but that first impression gets crushed almost instantly and gets exchanged with words like devious, scheming, daggers, fighter, insane and - in my case - fangirl screaming. \\n\r\nIf you're male and think right now that it's just another Anime only meant to entertain crazy Yaoi fangirls: you're wrong. You get to see a lot of nice stuff yourself. Don't miss out on it! ;)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very nice overall but there are some scenes where they just didn't care or made them especially bad on purpose or whatever. I don't care because it's usually not that obvious. Usually....\\n\\n\r\nDon't have much to say about the sound. It's great. The only thing is that i dislike the 2nd opening but it's kinda to be expected after the amazing first one...\\n\\n\r\nAs for the enjoyment... Durarara!! only has the tags mystery, supernatural and action, but it contains so much more. You find an innocent love, lots of drama and comedy for example. The first episode might be a bit dull. The rest aren't. As soon as I saw the 2nd episode, I was hooked and just couldn't stop watching anymore. Each week I had to wait for an update was way too long and now, 5 years later, I once again find myself waiting just as impatient for the newest episodes of the latest season. \\n\\n\r\nIn short: Don't miss out on this mindblowing Anime. You'll probably next to never find something as crazy and good as this again!",

            "content": "Okay let's get back in business for another big review. This time it's Durarara!!, Brains Base's latest series. In a nutshell, the series \"follows\" the life of  Ryuugamine Mikado, a newcomer to the big flashy city of Ikebukuro. Toss in a man as strong as steel, a headless Irish Dullahan and a manipulative sunovabeech and you\u2019ve got a pretty amazing concept.\r\nI said \"follows\" because unlike many series out there, and much like Narita Ryougo's Baccano!, Durarara!! doesn't really have a set protagonist as such. This is most evident in the first half, where we were presented with VERY Baccano!-styled material, using an often non-linearapproach, and multiple perspectives of a single event. Heck, we even ended up with a very cool cameo by Isaac and Miria, which would have pretty funny for those acquainted with the series.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the great things about Durarara!! was its range of characters. Everyone has a favourite. They (most) are interesting to watch and follow, and Durarara!! seldom succumbs to cliche. I think bonus points should go to Ise Mariya who voiced the stalker Harima Mika. She really got Mika\u2019s voice and character down-pat. I don't think I need to talk about the otakus Erika and (especially) Walker. They\u2019re always fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, like another series I JUST reviewed *cough Angel Beats! cough*, character developement also suffers. Earlier in the year I mentioned how this could turn out to be one of the main weaknesses in this series\u2026 and it did. Ideally there should have been more time dedicated to developing characters such as Shingen (Shinra\u2019s father) who only appeared twice or thrice, and Officer Kinnosuke (who\u2019s addition barely made a ripple).\\n\\n\r\nA GOLDEN TURD should go to Shizuo\u2019s brother Kasuka, who appeared in the 2nd half OP, yet never actually appeared IN the 2nd half.  Heck, Isaac and Miria appeared more times in this series if you count the billboards and banners that appear in Ikebukuro. Besides that, the three \u2018main\u2019 characters in Durarara!! were probably the most boring/less interesting compared to the other \u2018major\u2019 characters. I never liked Kida, and I doubt I ever will.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Durarara!! is of decent length (24 episodes), it just begs for more of what we saw in the first half. There's so many characters in this city, and Brains Base clearly couldn't give all of them their due. Soundtrack is pretty unusual, ranging from some Irish strings to some jazz. However it all fits well on the screen and it just goes to show what weird and wonderful things you\u2019ll find in a big city. As mentioned before, the voice actors are all pretty cool. Kamiya Hiroshi was great as Izaya, and Kana Hanazawa was a cool and calm Anri\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much else I can say about Durarara!!. The animation was great at the start, but started to get a little boring in the definitely more lacklustre 2nd half. The bouts of comedy were actually pretty damn good, and I had plenty of laughs watching the first half. Although it\u2019s nowhere near legendary status, I give Durarara!! a solid thumbs up. Well done Brains Base for another good watch.\\n\\n",

While the later episodes aren't a total snooze fest like say SAO, they do revolve around sudden love and really expose how lame the mains are in the same fashion. The writers manage to keep you engaged though, with twisty cliff hangers at the end of each episode for a while but they wind up writing themselves intoa corner when you figure out the final conflict could have been solved in minutes with a simple conversation between the mains. They explain this by having them all be suddenly too timid and afraid to talk to each other and it was a tough sale for me. I could have also done without all the love and relationship drama that mostly makes up the last half. A lot of it didn't make sense and it led to a whimper of an ending.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, if you can deal with a lot relationship drama and questionable character motives, you might find an enjoyable anime overall. However if that sounds like a turn-off, I could still recommend the first 12 or 13 episodes.",

            "content": "Durarara!! is a pleasant show to watch in your spare time if you like being kept in the dark for the majority of the show.\r\nStory:\r\nDurarara!!'s plot is very unique in that it each episode follows around a certain  character, from their point of view. The series goes on like this revolving around 3-4 arcs, just told from various points of view. Don't get me wrong, that doesn't mean there isn't any plot development. In this series all of the characters contribute to essential key points in the movement of the storyline. Most of the episodes only provide snipets into characters' lives, but everything culminatesat the end of the show, and we are given a panoramic view of the story. \\n\\n\r\nI thought Durarara was a little forced blend of comedy, romance, and the morose, but that doesn't really deter watchers-- it gives the anime a vibe that can only really be described as offbeat and urban.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI believe the animation for DRRR was very beautifully done. Ikebukuro, the where everything takes place, is illuminated with A+ animation. You'll notice right away that background people or inhabitants of the city may be gray shaded, but you learn to overlook that. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI thought the voice acting was normal, I usually don't really pay attention to the voice actors influxes and dips. The opening and closing themes I thought were forgettable. The background music to the anime however was pleasant.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI enjoyed all the characters; they all had their own quirks and backstories and strangely went against what I would expect from their characters. Character development is crazy. This is to be expected from a show with several plot twists. Everyone really has their own story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWhile this series was interesting, I wouldn't say that I was hooked. Usually being hooked means that I stay up into the wee hours of the morning to keep watching, but honestly I had no problem going to sleep early even after a major plot was revealed. It's interesting though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI would give this series a solid 7. I thought it was good, but not amazing. It's something to watch if you have the spare time, but I wouldn't say it's a must-see.\\n",

I have currently seen 2 of the seasons and i think both of their animation styles are only slightly different and i dont see any problem with them. (I like both of them).\r\nSound\r\nFirst of all the opening is fucking great and the ending is okay. There are alot of great soundtracks for speed up scenes action scenes, some characters even have their own soundtracks for some stuff.The music is always placed in the right place and really fits what is happening on screen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very awesome (my personal favorite from the show is Shizuo because he is just too fucking awesome). I think there was a bit of character development (there was like alot of plot twists if that counts)\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise this season of the anime it is basically a plot twist on top of another plot twist but the plot twists are actually good and don't ruin the anime (for me atleast).",

            "content": "Gang wars+the Supernatural+Chat Rooms=Durarara!! \r\nIt sounds like a clusterfuck, and at times it is. But it's an enjoyable clusterfuck. In episode one we're introduced to our main characters Makato and Masaomi, through them we're given a brief introduction of the living breathing world of Ikebukuro. I said earlier that Makado and Masaomi are the main characters but that's not one hundred percent accurate. This show has more of a rotating cast, as the series goes on you'll come to know a wide group of characters and their inner circles. You'll learn about the mysterious \"Headless Rider\" and the back alley doctor that they live with,you'll about a shy girl that befriends Makado and Masaomi, you'll learn about a small group of friends who are involved in a color(less) gang called the \"Dollars\", you'll learn about a man with unnatural strength and endurance, and you'll learn about an information broker who plays puppet master to all the other characters in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThis is both the shows best and worst aspect. The cast of characters is large and each of them are interesting enough but since there are so many characters and the show tries to give each of them equal screen time like it's determined to not have any characters be anything less than a main character the show as a whole suffers. There's only so much you can do when there are five different groups running around Ikebukuro doing things that are only tangentially related to each other are fighting for screen time it's kind of hard to let your characters or story grow. It's not that the creators handle this poorly...but it's a herculean task and the writers just miss the mark. But on the flipside these characters are fun to watch and I thought their personalities were enough to carry the slightly lackluster story.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was great, but I'm usually not very critical of visuals so as long as there isn't too much re-used footage. Similarly I thought the sound design was fine but I'm usually not too critical of it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a decent series that sacrifices story for a larger cast.",

            "content": "I had passed by Durarara!! on the title screen of Netflix countless times before actually watching it. I'm still not sure what actually drew me into starting it, but I'm sure glad I did. One particular thing that always stood out to me was the background on the info. You know, that photo that shows in the title area. The one with Shizuo, Izaya, Anri, and Mikado all lined up in suits. I can definitely remember looking at Izaya and just sensing something about him. \r\nStory (9/10) \r\nThe story itself was really interesting to me. Before Durarara, I hadn't watched or explored many anime/manga genres,so it was a new intro to me. For one, I had never heard of a dullahan-type character like Celty. I would've given a ten for this section, but some parts were a bit predictable, so I deducted a point. Actually, it was going to be more like minus 3 points, but the whole color gangs and tension between the Raira gang just kinda caught me way off guard, man.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10) \\n\r\nThe art compliments everything else perfectly, especially the way it's so diverse. For example, Mikado's eyes are large and give off a youthful look, which personify his naive self. On the other hand, Izaya's eyes are much thinner, and send an almost evil message. There's also little details that just make it all the more enjoyable, like when someone laughs or smirks, you can see the eyes slant the slightest, but still enough. However, just like x2's animation, there's the awful background chara's design. A prime example is in episode 25, during Shizuo and Izaya's fight.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) \\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing. Really. It does an amazing job of drawing you in at all the right moments. Before discovering the soundtrack, I had been falling asleep to random music in my library. Now, I listen to a selection of the songs from it, especially the soft ones.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9/10)\\n\r\nAs I typed the word \"Character,\" I could feel my heart slowly picking up speed, and my face was plastered with the widest grin. The characters are like, one of my favorite aspects of Durarara. Take Mikado. When he's introduced, he's shown as a shy naive boy. But as the show progresses, so does his character development. The same goes for Kida and Anri. But, the character that really stands out to me is (yes, I know he's way popular, I just love him to death) Izaya. I also love the way he was introduced in that dark alley. In the first episode, he appears all dark and mysterious (I won't say for the second episode cos I laughed when he walked out looking drunk or something lmaoo). Actually, I feel like Izaya is one of the reasons episode 3 is so iconic to me. Shizuo also plays a part there, props to him for shutting Izaya up. Speaking of those two, I might get a few confused looks here, but I always felt like Shizuo and Izaya never got to actually fight that much on screen. I mean, all they did was just talk shit about each other to others, spare episodes 3, 16 (if you count that), and 25. I think they deserved a lot more character development than what was given.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\r\nThis kinda ties in with the end of the character section, but like I was saying, I think a ton of the characters never really got te chance to show their true colors. Setting that aside, I still enjoyed every second of this show. Okay, well, not the end, but you get my point. I recently finished this show for the 3rd time, and I plan to rewatch it soon. There's a reason Durarara!! became my favorite show, and it's because I loved how surreal it felt. Unlike some anime, Durarara!!'s story has good action and adventure, but it also has those scenes that just make you want to jump right in and join the conversation or whatever. (Not to say this is the only anime like that, I'm just saying the story isn't so out there and unrealistic that the calamity blends in perfectly.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\r\nDurarara!! is a show that'll leave you on the edge of your seat, bawling your eyes out, and laughing along with the characters, and possibly, all in one night. One of the things that make me love Durarara!! so much is that they don't kill anyone off. So you don't have to worry about that here! Just enjoy the fun times, and if you're into that kinda stuff, check out the ships. I know shizaya's super popular, but I personally believe there's a good reason for that. Also! If you enjoy the anime, you should def check out the novel! Not only do you get Yasuda-sensei's beautiful artwork, you get tons of left out details!",

While overall it\u2019s plenty entertaining and has something to say, I don\u2019t think it fully knows how to say it, or at least say it well. It\u2019s a savant child of storytelling but one who is misguided and confused.  It runs about on a mission, babbles excitedly to a lot of different people, brings a lot of diversity to its cast, but sometimes is overly ambitious in what it wants to say. There\u2019s an overall story to be told here, and you get from pointA to point B in 24 episodes without emerging too confused. But the ending leaves a lot to be desired, leaving all the chaff characters and odd mysteries as more arbitrary than open-ended prospects to be revisited in its following seasons.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the show isn\u2019t without some brilliance. While it\u2019s cheaply told to the viewer rather than shown expressed through its ensemble casts\u2019 motivations, it\u2019s a show that moves the plot forward in a way that few shows don\u2019t; through theme. It sets up an outsider\u2019s underdog theme and navigates about an urban sprawl of occasionally fantastic elements, guiding the viewer to think about how complex and unknowable life, people, and their motivations are,  and it shows strongly throughout. Which when the show wants to shine through with a message, it\u2019s so bright you can\u2019t help but clap. The way of doing it is flawed; it gives you an ambitiously giant cast defined by their backgrounds in order to tell a story about an important few. The point of the show gets muddled and boring sometimes when everyone is talking at you. It sometimes gets boring and arbitrary having Izaya tell you about philosophy only for fighting to occur and sorta resolve some problems. This is the biggest problem with the show is that it wants to be cool and slick while remaining thoughtful and even existential. The result is messy, and the scale tips very far in one direction or too far in the other. But that it tips in either way at all gives it a high bar of a good watch from me, even if it tries to bite off more than it can chew. Above all else Durarara\u2019s strong suit is keeping you interested and thinking along the road to a resolution even if the end result isn\u2019t as interesting or fun as \\n\r\nwhat brought you there. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of the show is pretty run of the mill, yet its functionality is important to the storytelling to a degree. It sticks out enough to make you pay attention to what it\u2019s about to say even if the art direction used to create distance from the characters doesn\u2019t tell you much other than that; they\u2019re distant from the unknown. But it\u2019s still consistent and what I expected from an average animation standpoint. The show and its characters remain in constant motion yet there\u2019s a different shot from each scene. It\u2019s a simple compliment to the overall project but you\u2019d be surprised how many shows cut corners with reused animation. The quality control of the animation is good, even if it took no risks to bedazzle the audience and become more than just average. The only hiccups that bothered me were in fight scenes that involved mobs. Combatants behind the focal characters just stared blankly or blended into crowds or backgrounds. I gripe about this because a lot of the fight scenes were the peak of interesting animation had to offer in the show.\\n\\n\r\nBut mobs also become important to the show\u2019s storytelling, and shading the masses as grey forms unknown to the main characters was interesting even if it wasn\u2019t used to its full potential. The beginning of the show sets up pretty plainly that Mikado is vulnerable and distant from everyone in his new life. Setting him apart from crowds and the unknown populace without color and highlighting those of danger a la Sin City makes full use of storytelling through a visual medium. Beyond that, I looked through promotional posters before viewing the show and thought about colors and patterns of thought afterwards. I picked up that the show had some theme patterns added purposefully to speak to the viewer. And let me say there\u2019s a lot of yellow; caution tape in front of the characters, capped on top of characters dangerous, interesting or pivotal. It always stuck out from the rest of the color palate of grey urban cityscapes dimly lit by neon. Granted it stops being a useful color when Celty and the Yellow Scarves both have it for seemingly no reason, but it\u2019s an important stripe that sticks out from everything else to get you to pay attention. Even when it doesn\u2019t do much for the storytelling.\\n\\n\r\n I can\u2019t really comment on the plot because it just isn\u2019t there. But the micro stories contained within the overall arc can be interesting, at least in the first 13 episodes, the show kinda drops off in the second half. In addition to smaller stories being interesting the art of the show makes up for what the plot lacks to get the viewer to pay attention.  But overall the story deals with interesting ideas that make the plot that is there really compelling. At the beginning of the show the viewer is as vulnerable and uninformed of the new setting as Mikado. Like us with the show, seeing all the characters and possibly the fanbase talking about why it\u2019s so good, Mikado is intimidated by the challenge of fitting in and being. As we keep going we find that many more characters look to blend in or make an impact on something or someone. It\u2019s a really human theme that keeps the characters somewhat close despite their back stories that often leave a lot to be desired. However it\u2019s always an endearing feature of the show that keeps the plot interesting even if it gets a little thin by the end. The plot isn\u2019t interesting during its chug forward in the latter half, and it mostly about Mikado and his friends daily encounters with gangs and other characters. \\n\\n\r\nWhat is cool though is how show plays on the curiosity of the unknowable by introducing supernatural/magical realist characters like Celty, Shizuo and the mysterious Slasher. Their powers are more than an excuse to animate fight scenes as their supernatural abilities reveal how far other characters like Izaya and Seiji are willing to go in their quests to get what they want. Subplots revolving around as Celty\u2019s missing head, Shizuo not being able to control his power, and the viral power of the Dollars\u2019 network and the gossip revolving around the Slasher were the most interesting parts of the show. To me they showed everything interesting behind the yellow caution tape. They say a lot about how far out of hand exploring the unknown goes. But unfortunately that\u2019s a very small portion of the show. From the breaks in the action or the rising tension of a scene there may be a long thought about life or existence from a character (usually Izaya). \\n\\n\r\nThe thoughts and ideas are laid out almost bluntly to give the viewer to think about. They are thoughtful, but such soliloquies are so jarring and displaced from what\u2019s going on in each slice of life episode that it seems cheap and rushed to add their message. While each discussion makes the viewer think on some level and continues thinking about the difficulties of fitting in, the shift of focus from story to plainly drawn out message cheapens the journey the viewer has taken to get to a point of reward. When the show wants to shine with getting a message across or tell an interesting microcosmic back story, it does it really well. Yet the plot slips through its hands that are too greased up with the cool factor that the show wants to have.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the weakest part of the show. I definitely liked all of them but it was really difficult to care about them. While it might seem a little harsh any characters I don\u2019t talk about here I didn\u2019t find interesting enough to mention. They all definitely had a cool access point that got me interested, whether they were a morally ambivalent scientist into the supernatural for the money or the starter of a mad love affair equally infected by the same human curiosity. But if the interest of the characters could be measured by a hundred meter dash Seiji and Namie would start of strong but get exhausted pretty quick. Some characters are utterly pointless other than being segues or tools for status or edging the plot forward. Tom is this to Shizuo and police biker is this to Celty. The only three characters that have much of an arc are the main three kids and what they do to cope with their pasts. I liked what pushed Masaomi and Anri to become what they did about halfway through the show, but there\u2019s no back story for Mikado that sets him apart as a protagonist, let alone a compelling one, other than him being him being tossed in the world with us as an access point to Ikebukuro. \\n\\n\r\nNext are Shinra and Izaya, who are different and grounded in their personalities. While I wanted an in depth look at their relationship with Ikebukoro they remained strong characters because of who they love. For Shinra its an undying commitment to Celty and for it Izaya it\u2019s his love for, well, violence and the emotional and existential pain of others. They\u2019re supporting characters and they definitely know it, and because of it Shinra remains kind and endearingly oblivious and Izaya cheeky and morally ambivalent. And finally theres the true leaders of the pack remain Shizuo, and Celty. Their backstories are clear, motives compelling, and objectives simple. They\u2019re also solved to a degree and they truly left me thirsting for more, and honestly are the main two reasons I\u2019ll be getting around to season 2 at all.\\n\\n\r\nDurarara is more of an exercise in interesting ideas that is held back by its own weight of everything it brings to the table. The beginning of the show builds a world of uncertainty and anxiety, filled with denizens as diverse and confused as the last. The borderline magical realism that the supernaturally gifted characters bring to the show whips up a compelling story even if its built on in a disorganized way. It\u2019s great as a visual medium, as the distance created from the outsider theme between characters make the first half of the show amazing. Yet Durarara\u2019s grip goes so far that it can\u2019t really fit in the black and yellow running shoes it\u2019s made to bedazzle its audience. Teeters between a 7 and an 8, but I'm willing to give future installments a watch.\\n",

Hmm.. maybe I shouldn't have typed super, since it contradicts my previous statement that I found it boring at the beginning. \r\nStory: \r\nWell, the plot was awesome. It's kind of complex and unexpected. Characters met other characters unknowingly or by pure coincidence or through someone else's scheme.\r\nHowever, as I said before, it's kind of boring in thebeginning. The story was kind of hard to follow, but everything connects so the ones watching might as well pay attention to the important parts of every episode. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I reached this certain episode, I was filled with excitement as though all those feelings of boredom never existed.

            "content": "So when I started out watching Durarara, I wasn't really impressed with what I was watching. I mean I was literally introduced to a plain ordinary boy, otherwise known as Mikado, getting off a train to this city called Ikebukuro that apparently was supposed to be interesting. While I'm not trying to necessarily hate on this anime, there were definitely times where I wasn't motivated to even watch it. Boy, was I wrong. I'll tell you why as I go down the list here:\r\nStory:\r\nSo like I said earlier, the anime just begins to introduce you to all these characters. Mikado being one of the maincharacters and Kida, his best friend.I'll try not to reveal most of what goes on in the story. Basically, Mikado is exposed to many urban legends that surround the city such as the headless rider and the slasher. It may be just me, but when I was first learning about all these different situations that was going on, I was really confused and didn't even know what was going on. But hey, that's a mystery for you. In my opinion, this anime could've had a better \"hook\" persay because again, I never had that tingly feeling that would make me all excited to watch the next episode. There were however moments that would make me say \"Wait, are you serious??!\" or \"No way!\". Basically, I was shocked and surprised a lot at the development of the plot line. But at some parts where it was supposed to be a secret, I was able to easily predict who was who and what was what, but trust me, that only happened at most two times. Throughout the anime, more information about the mystery was disclosed and it all just started connecting together and actually made sense. Along the way, there were plot twists, the true identities of characters were revealed and so forth. Also, just for a fun fact and extra detail; though it wasn't listed as a genre, I would put romance as one because it was definitely noticeable. It may not be the most important factor to this plot, but it deserves to be noticed. It was very cute, but I can't tell who it's between. Sorry!~^^  \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis anime revolved around the theme of gangs and beating each other up and all that good stuff. The art did fit the theme and story well. I really liked the design of Ikebukuro. It really made me feel like I was in this average city, but you know, with gang members everywhere. I can't really describe it all that well, but if I were to imagine myself in that city without knowing the anime at all, I would be able to tell that there's more to that place than meets the eye. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound was awesome in my opinion. Each OST(Original Sound Track) that played in the background of each particular scene just fitted so perfectly. Especially in certain creepy parts where it sounded like I was in some horror movie. It really did give me goosebumps. Or those moments where its just another typical day in that city, or maybe you're at that Russian sushi shop (which is what you'll see if you decide to watch it) As far as I know, it was Jazz music and it really set the mood just the way the anime intended. Moving on to the first opening and ending. Now usually, I would skip the opening, but this one just clicked with me. It was definitely catchy and had this certain beat to it that made me grab my imaginary drumsticks and tap along to it. Also, the use of electric guitar was amazing. Overall, the opening pretty much made me want to rock out with my air guitar. It sure did fit the whole gang theme well. Now the first ending...wow, that song reminds me of some Jpop song made by a boy band. The beginning was misleading cause it sounded like a rap song, but NOPE! It broke out into cute boys singing xD The second opening of this anime is average. It gave off this sad tone as if everybody made mistakes and is pondering about them. It reminded me of a lot of other songs such as the opening of Ao No Exorcist, but that doesn't mean its bad. The ending I would say is great too. The voices sounded like they came from a lot of other romance action anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nAs pointed out earlier in this review, one of the main characters Mikado is very ordinary, but very awkward, in a good (and adorable) way. However, his personality does bring some sort of balance compared to all the others wackos in this anime xD Kida I feel is a very complicated guy. He seems very cheery, happy, perverted, and just plain weird. But that's just what I love about him. However, like most characters in this anime, there's a dark past behind that mask of his. Anri, the girl with the glasses and famously big breasts (lol) reminds me of Mikado, except she's pretty much emotionless. I mean she smiles here and there, but in the beginning, she didn't really do or say much. Didn't give off an interesting impression unlike Kida. But as the anime changed, so did her personality. The rest of the characters all contributed to the story in some way. They were all important to the plot of course, but Im not going to talk about them. I will however discuss Izaya and Shizuo. Now Shizuo is pretty much the comic relief. Every time he beats someone up, it's just freakin hilarious to see him rip off some street sign or vending machine and throw it all over the place. The relationship he has with Izaya is obvious. They are rivals. (But I bet they secretly love each other Shizuo x Izaya for the win! lol ) Izaya reminds me of a black cat for some reason. Just a guy who you don't wanna mess with and is also very cunning. His personality is questionable due to the fact he refers to people as his \"playthings\" and for some \"odd\" reason, he always purposely goes to bother Shizuo even though he says he's a pain. (hmm, I wonder why he would do that *hint* *hint* *wink* *wink* \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nSo I gave this a seven for reasons that have already been stated. I mean I started the anime in July and officially finished it the year after in March. I usually don't do that. So I really must've not been interested enough to even keep watching it til the end. But I realized that I needed to be more patient with it. and what do you know, that old phrase \"good things come to those who wait\" is true. I was given a great ending and ova. I felt they could've taken their time with ending Durarara, but oh well, it was good enough. There was closure to everything...well...eh...mostly everything. I can't say what I wished was elaborated more on. However, that's only one issue. The rest were answered, although kind of rushed, but still a good answer. When I finished the anime, I had a thought that went along the lines of \"Wow, that was one great anime. So glad I decided to finish it\" \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI've already said what I thought of this anime. To those who are hesitant about watching the anime. My advice to you is to be patient. It may seem boring at first, but when the moment when everything given is just put together is just so worth the wait. Definitely a mystery worth watching!~ :D\\n",

            "content": "\"It all happened here at Ikebukuro.\"\r\nThis is a street gang soap opera of a series. It is driven by some of the most ridiculously zany characters I have seen. From the first episode it is easy to see why it's a popular anime series. There's everything from headless horsewomen to black Russian sushi greeters. This is a must see.\r\nThe story is told in a very busy way. It's non-linear with a lot of backpedaling and intersecting between the various character story lines. It is brilliant at times, but the chaotic delivery does get distracting at some parts. This series started to lose me a bituntil the 10th episode where the first major twist came into play. From that point forward I was watching very intently.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was done very nice. Background characters were dull and gray in color so as not to distract from the extremely colorful characters that were important for each scene. It made them stand out that much more, and it was used as a great delivery tool at certain key moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe music fit the craziness of the story. It complimented the voice acting, though the narrative done by each character was a bit busy at times. Overall I have no complaints about the quality of the sound.\\n\\n\r\nThis series really boiled down to it's characters. Each character was funny in one way or another. Some were disturbingly funny in how twisted they were in the most bizarre of moments, while others were very slapstick. The humor in the story was sometimes out of left field in such a refreshing way. This did not steal any of the dramatic scenes, as there were still plenty of emotional moments as well. Each character had a background story that unfolded in a very interesting way. It's hard to talk about the characters, because I am tempted to fill this review with spoilers. Let just say characters make this world go round.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of surprises, plenty of twists, and there's lots of enjoyment to be had in this series. I do want to reiterate what I said before about it losing me a little in the beginning. I had tried to watch this series a few months ago but put it down after the sixth episode. This time around I almost did the same thing due to the chaotic delivery, but then episode 10 ended and I couldn't stop watching.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy zany character driven stories, then this is for you. Definitely check this one out.",

            "content": "Warning: I might end up being kind of bias because I really love this anime. I'm not sure if this clogs my judgment but I thought you should know.\r\nLast summer I had a lot of free time on my hands and I wanted to take that free time and waste it. So I began watching a lot of weekly animes. One of these was Durarara!! which became one of my favorite animes almost instantly.\r\nDurarara!! is about the Tokyo district Ikebukuro and all the strange happenings that occur there. The main character, Mikado Ryuugamine (who spelled that right? I SPELLED THAT RIGHT!), has just moved tothe area right outside of Ikebukuro and is now attending school there with his best friend Masaomi. These two and their new friend Anri are pulled into the midst of a dangerous game in which only one person, the creepy and possibly insane Izaya Orihara, knows all the players. Some of the interesting entities in this show include a gang whose members are completely unknown, a man with super strength and a bad temper, and a headless motorcyclist who is searching for her long lost head.\\n\\n\r\nSo that is the simplest version of this plot which jumps from perspective and to perspective like a rabbit on caffeine. Mikado may be the main character but he is one of the people you know least about because the plot focuses on all characters in near equal amounts.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this series is wonderful. It's by the same studio who did Baccano and, just like Baccano, it has a very earthy texture and subdued colors. The movement is clean and realistic and the character design is subtle yet distinctive (as in, they all look different, but very few look ridiculous).\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing about this series I admire most, however, is it's uninhibited approach to fantasy. Realistically, if strange stuff happened on a regular basis it would eventually become normal and that's how Durarara!! is approached. Even though one of the characters has NO HEAD (I can't stress this enough) the series is never treated like fantasy and the other characters don't treat her strangely either. And even though another character throws vending machines, it's never suggest that this is unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's not like the characters live in a different reality. This is OUR reality and these people where made to be like normal people. Even though, by our standards they're not.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character actually spoke about this at one point. I can't remember the exact quote but it went something like \"I always wanted to lead an extraordinary life. I didn't know, however, that something that is unusual is only unusual for a few days and then it becomes normal. I can't live an extraordinary life because, to me, my life will always be 'ordinary'.\"\\n\\n\r\nSo that's Durarara!!. An ordinary tale about extraordinary happenings.",

I'm proud to say though that it had all these elements and more and that's why i liked it so much. \r\nHaving all these elements in Durarara are what make it so great, you have the relationships in it that you want to see through to the end, bits of fighting scenes that shock you and may even make you laugh, and then learning about certain characters and what makes them tick. This aspect isone i loved, you seem to learn more and more about each character in Durarara as it progresses. Its also unique in how the narrator changes each time to give you a new feel for each episode. I just don't want to say too much in the hopes you check it out for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nSo that being said, this was a very good anime and is worth being checked out.",

            "content": "**THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS**\r\nAfter hearing a large amount of praise for this anime and as well as the sizable fanbase that it has gathered over 5 years I finally decided to watch Durarara!! and I found Durarara!! to be an very interesting anime due to just how insane it is with it's story and how it handled characters.\r\nStory: (7/10)\r\nThe story of Durarara!! begins with a guy named Ryuugamine Mikado who has always wanted to visit Tokyo because he has never gone outside his town before finally gets his wish and starts living in Ikebukuro. After seeing the urban legend called the BlackRider on the first day in the city, many weird events begin to occur all around Ikebukuro. The story for Durarara!! is definitely a unique one because of how the story doesn't just go from point A and B like most anime do, each character has a separate story that is told through their perspective that all eventually intertwine together and seeing all the stories come together is very satisfying. Another thing Durarara does with its story is that it tends to change how the story is told by sometimes suddenly transitioning to past events which is an interesting method of storytelling but can sometimes lead to confusion because of how we are not told that the events actually took place in the past until it finally leads up to current events that are happening and then being able to realize that it was a past event, so I would say that this is a negative for the story due to the confusion that it causes. Another problem I found in the story was how in the end of the anime it left some loose ends which made it a somewhat unsatisfying ending but since there are 3 more seasons after this I think that those should be able to fix this.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: (6/10)  \\n\\n\r\nI thought that the art for Durarara!! was fine because it would sometimes look unappealing due to how the people in the background would be not colored in and would be left white or purple. I thought that the backgrounds could also use a bit of work. There were many good character designs. The animation even thought that it would look choppy at times was actually pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in Durarara!! I would say is pretty good because of how all the music is varied and how it could help build an atmosphere during scenes. The OPs and EDs are good. The voice acting was above average and the sound effects are average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely the best part of Durarara!! and that would make sense since Durarara!! is a character driven story. Most of the characters are well written with the backstories that they are given and I found Izaya to be the best one out of all of them because of his personality and how he would just observe events unfold before him like it was all a part of his plan. My only problem with the characters would be how some characters would have more development than others and even Mikado didn't much screen time compared to the other characters but that would probably be due to the large amount of characters that are in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed this anime and I will plan to watch the second season next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nIf you want an anime that has a unique and entertaining story with a cast of  dynamic characters I would definitely recommend this anime to you.",

            "content": "Well, you can say after the debut of Baccano! In Japan and possibly the states, you could say you hope to find more anime that\u2019s similar to this with its\u2019 large cast of enteraining characters and their larger-than-life wild and serial antics but luckily, this series is also adapted by a light novel from the same author Ryohgo Narita and is also made by the same animation company Brains\u2019 Base.\r\nRy\u016bgamine Mikado is a boy who longs for the exciting life of the big city. At the invitation of his childhood friend Masaomi, he transfers to a school in Ikebukuro. Masaomi has warned him about peoplehe doesn't want to cross in the city: a champion fighter, an informant, and a mysterious gang called \"Dollars.\" Nervous from Masaomi's stories, Mikado witnesses an urban legend on his first day in the city, the Headless Rider astride a black motorcycle. From then on, the existence of supernatural cases and a gang called the Yellow Scarves will rise to the surface, and Ikebukuro will pushed to the breaking point.\\n\\n\r\nLike in Baccano!, this show has a very large cast of characters and the majority of them are very entertaining to watch and you would want to watch them over and over and over again. For example, Celty Sturluson aka The Black (or Headless) Rider, who came to Japan to search for her stolen head and the only way of her communicating via PDA, which to me, is a small shame, considering when the audience hears her voice, it\u2019s actually quite pleasant. Throughout the series, she lives with underground doctor Shinra Kishitani and eventually both of them pursue a romantic relationship with each other, which to me, is something I find to be sweet and weird at the same time\u2026..I mean, think about it. I don\u2019t think many people would want a girlfriend with no head\u2026.actually, no. ALL PEOPLE don\u2019t want a girlfriend without a head! Despite that, I find their plotline and relationship interesting and fascinating. Next up, it\u2019s Shizuo Heiwajima, a blond man in a bartender\u2019s suit who hates to be angered and loathes violence but when his fuse gets shorter and when he fights, he has the strength of 100 bodybuilders and when these moments happen, you feel so into these character, much like Ladd Russo in Baccano!, only this guy isn\u2019t a crazy killer, just pretty damn crazy.\\n\\n\r\nThen it\u2019s the four supporting characters that you wish you want to meet in real life: Kyohei Kadota, Walker Yumasaki, Erika Karisawa, and Saburo Togusa. Kyohei is the leader of their group, especially after all four quitting the Blue Squares, and really hates to be called Dotachin. Walker and Erika are passionate otaku and manga reader, which I get many of them, will know the references. There was a few times that Walker may seem dumb due to that smile in his face but sometimes putting a dumb look can help hide your true intentions (if you hide it right). Erika likes a lot of yaoi/fujoshi and is a Boys Love fan. It is also implied that they are romantically linked and there\u2019s Saburo, who is the driver of the group and gets mad whenever his van is wrecked.  I just really like the dynamic of this group, like they are actual friends; they think together as a group and would stick together through some tough events.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there is Simon Brezhnev, a tall Black Russian man who runs a sushi shop and while he is a force to be reckoned with, he\u2019s more friendly and uses his mind in case of confrontation; Plus, Orihara Izaya is really the asshole of the series but the asshole you love to hate, which is a great deal in my book, mainly because of his rivalry with Shizuo. Now, the last 3 main characters (Mikado Ryugamine \u2013 the new kid of the block, Masaomi Kida \u2013 the best friend and mostly a douchebag at some parts, Anri Sonohara \u2013 the bespectacled quiet timid girl who befriends the two boys) were not that bad in characterization as they are mainly the observers and they developed partially but compared to the others, they\u2019re kind of bland and worst of all, half way through the series, the show mainly focuses of them. Now, I come to say that their part involving the Dollars, Masaomi\u2019s deal with the Blue Squares and Saki being in the hospital, and the possession of Saika, are not boring. I was invested in those plotlines, too, but the others never had a resolution solved and leaves me wanting more of that or at least a second season, although this series\u2019 strongest point is that it had more episodes and needed more.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation, Brains\u2019 Base made some bad-ass animation for the first 12 episodes, but when it gets to the second half, the animation has beginning to lag at some of the movements, the fights, the character animation and the designs. I guess budget problems got the best of them (hopefully not Gonzo levels) but it was a decent effort. The score overall has a major Baccano influence written all over but the opening and ending themes are where it shined, mainly the ending themes more than the openings. However \"Uragiri no Y\u016byake\" (\u88cf\u5207\u308a\u306e\u5915\u713c\u3051; Betrayal of the Sunset) by Theatre Brook, I find more listenable than the second opening \"Complication\" (\u30b3\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30b1\u30a4\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3) by ROOKiEZ is PUNK'D. As for the ending themes \"Trust Me\" by Y\u016bya Matsushita and \"Butterfly\" by ON/OFF are equally listenable but I lean towards the latter for being more into the series than the first being just a J-Pop single.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the dub brought to you by the wonderful Bang Zoom Entertainment studios and it was the first dubbed anime to be licensed by Aniplex of America and they don\u2019t do much dubs due to business reasons, which I can respect, but glad this was dubbed however, there were some flaws I licensed in there but for the good points, there were great performances from Steven Blum, Crispin Freeman, Patrick Seitz, Yuri Lowenthal, Johnny Yong Bosch but the standout of the dub has got to be Kari Wahlgren as Celty. Some of the mid-weaker performances from Darrel Guillbeau and Bryce Papenbrook were noticeable, especially from the former, and Michelle Ruff was really off in her performance as Anri, which I\u2019m sorry to say because she is a great VA but the worst of all is when they did a cameo from that other series that I mention (and I won\u2019t spoil for those who haven\u2019t seen it) and the voices are really off and that cameo was really unnecessary to do.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: I really wish when Adult Swim aired this, I\u2019m would\u2019ve watched this sooner because I had some thoughts about it being boring and dull but as it turns out, to me, this is better than Baccano! By all means, this is an excellent anime for most of the first half and some of the second. In the end, it leaves you wanting to explore more into these characters like what any form of media should. Could it have been more interesting if that stuck with more of the better characters? Yes, but it didn\u2019t stop me from loving this show.\\n",

As I said the story is engaging and it makes you want to keep watching.  The build-up heading to the end is outstanding and you really begin to care aboutwhere the characters are going to end up, but this only makes the flimsy conclusion all the more disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a more technical perspective, the story is good, a little bit average, but good.  It's engaging and if not for the ending would be very good.  There's nothing to really say about the art, it's pretty good and doesn't take away from the experience.  The same could pretty much be said about the sound also.  The characters as previously stated are good and make you care about them, but the score for enjoyment takes a hit because of the way they end the story.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line though, it's not a terrible anime all things considered the story leading up to the end is actually a little above average.  On the other side of things the ending is so poor that the anime winds up somewhere just below average.  If you want to know whether to watch this anime, I'd say don't go out of your way to watch it, but if you've got some extra time and nothing to do go for it, the story is enjoyable enough.",

            "content": "Well, this anime was probably the most boring anime I have ever watched. That makes me upset because I can clearly see the amount of love and effort that went into all aspects of it, but I didn't feel any emotional investment to continue watching.\r\nStory: There was a story? Throughout these 7 episodes that I have watched I was hoping for at least a little action. Something to me make me care about the characters, and something to look forward to in the next episode. Alas, it never came. Suspense, action, romance, excitement; all of these are things missing in the anime (as far asI have watched it). It shouldn't take a third of a season to get all of the characters introduced. 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was really nice. I enjoyed the animations, facial expressions, city landscape, etc.. No complaints here; it is a solid 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Sound was cool. Characters had great voices fitting their personalities. Music was ok, but nothing to write home about.  8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are pretty bad-ass. However, this series suffers from too much character introduction, and very little character development. This is partially due to the fact that in the 7 episodes that I watched, not a single major event occurred. There is a lot of room for character development but I am too uninvested to find out if there will ever be any. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I was thoroughly bored the entire time. Even crappy low budget anime never had this sort of effect on me. Total snooze-fest, unless you enjoy mindless banter. Simple ideas and concepts were drawn out to make them seem more \"deep\" and philosophical. In fact, the repetitive humdrum musings of my brain were far more exciting than the dialogue in this anime and took precedence for my attention span. In other words, it was so boring that I had to force myself to pay attention. Did I mention it was boring? 2/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Good characters, no real plot, waste of time. 5/10.",

            "content": "Durarara!! is an interesting anime. It's an anime that is one of it's kind, besides Baccano!. With an odd fish that is swimming in a sea of moe and eechi, how does Durarara!! hold up?\r\nStory:\r\nThe storytelling in Durarara, or DRRR, is very interesting. Rather than having a big overarching plot told in each episode, it focuses on the story and development of one specific character. And some scenes in one episode could happen in another episode and affect the story of that episode. It's a very unique way of telling the story and I really enjoy it. Some people say that the story-telling in the2nd half didn't match the first half's standards, but the only bad thing about the 2nd half was the plot twist involving the character Anri. If that wasn't there, the story would probably get a 10. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nDrrr was produced by Brains Base, who haven't done much besides this, Baccano, and Spice and Wolf II. The art is very good, every frame is detailed, the animation is fluid, and the fight scenes are very entertaining to watch. I think I even saw some gradient lighting in the scenes where they were in warehouses, which I love. However, the budget seemed to drop as the series went on. There's nothing very noticeable, but it still could have been better. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound for Drrr is very catchy. The two theme songs are magnificent, but only the fist ending managed to catch my attention. The music that was playing during the scenes in the show were great, but only one of them managed to get in my head. It's playing in my head as I'm writing this. None of the other songs managed to stick out, but they were still good nonetheless. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime are very interesting. There is no specific main character, similar to Baccano and Fate/Zero. All of the characters get an equal amount of development and all the characters get the same amount of screen time. It's a very interesting concept that should be in anime more often. One of my favorite characters was Izaya Orihara, who is pretty much the god of Ikebukuro, the city in which Drrr is set in. He knows everything and everyone, and gives cases to the Headless Rider, known as Celty, in order to stop crime under the radar of the police. He was one of my favorites because he managed to keep interesting throughout the entire show, always managed to pull a trick out of his sleeve, and was pretty much the nucleus of all the characters. By that I mean he managed to get everyone involved with everyone else. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\r\nDurarara was an interesting tale that can not be easily described. Describe on thing, the other person asks more and more questions. Suddenly you say something about the ending and you ruin the show for that person. Durarara is an urban tale that will keep you, your eyes, and your attention on the screen at all times. Durarara gets an 8 out of 10",

            "content": "Durarara is an anime, with a name that makes no sense. Had it been \"Dararara\" I would have understood it due to it partially has something to do with the story. But it doesn't, and the name it has makes no sense with neither story nor characters. But don't let the name discourage you, the show is still absolutely amazing.\r\nStory:\r\nTo begin with, there's not much story in here. The lead Ryugamine Mikado moves to Ikebukuro, Tokyo, to start at Raira High School, after being invited by his childhood friend Kida Masaomi. It is his first time outside of his hometown, and he suddenly meets manydifferent personalities in this new town. He is also told about color gangs, where the most discussed one is the mysterious and \"colorless\" is the one known as \"Dollars\" (or Darazu as they say in japanese). There is also a local legend known as the Black Bike, or the Headless Rider, which is where the fantasy aspects kick in.\\n\r\nSeveral times the presentation of the story changes, in one episode you follow Mikado and his friends talking about different things (like love, and color gangs), or them even witnessing a street fight (and a completely one-sided one, might I add). And then in the next episode you follow a completely different person, who experiences completely unrelated things. This brings me to the point that everything in this show is based off the characters, the story telling is put in the mind of several different people, and that is actually one of its charming points.\\n\r\nThough the story is almost entirely character introduction for the first half, pretty much everything changes once you get to know them, and the actual story develops. Basically, it's great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAs mentioned, there are many different personalities in this Ikebukuro. From high schoolers to black market doctors, Durarara features many different characters, who are very well developed. The story is told from the perspective of several charcters, many of which who never even meet, and by the end you will feel that you know them very well.\\n\r\nRyugamine Mikado is a timid, proper, kinda shy boy, and he isinterested in the abnormal. His best friend Kida Masaomi is a joker, he jokes about lots of things, and he doesn't act that serious until near the ending. He also likes hitting on girls. This group of three friends ends with Sonohara Anri, formal, quiet, and enjoys the normal relationship she has with her new friends.\\n\r\nNext we have Orihara Izaya, an information dealer who several times exclaims that he loves people, he also organizes several situations only to see how the people in them resolve these matters. He has a rival, Heiwajima Shizuo, he is the strongest person in Ikebukuro, he hates violence, but he constantly uses his almost superhuman strength to beat up people who annoy him with a street sign or a vending machine.\\n\r\nNext, Kishitani Shinra is a black market doctor, who is at several occasions called both perverted and weird. He lives with Celty Sturlson, aka the headless rider.\\n\r\nDurarara's characters are all funny, memorable, and loveable, and many of them also have something they want to hide from others. They are different, and it is likely that one of them will become one of your favourites.\\n\\n\r\nDesign:\\n\r\nThe animation style of Durarara is one I haven't seen before. The characters are expressful and well drawn, but the surprising part of this anime is the coloring. Colors are a pretty large part of the story, due to the concept of the color gangs. Many characters will be seen with different colors on them, many where yellow scarves since they are members of \"The Yellow Scarves\", but the most noticeable one is the colorlessness of the Dollars. Most of the people in the world of Durarara are grey, or colorless. The important people all feature colors, but all the unimportant people are completely grey. This fits really well, because it not only shows a very creative distinction between important and not, but it also fits along with all the talk about the Dollars, and being colorless, also it is said that the Dollars have grown in numbers increadibly, and it shows that it is very likely that these people are in fact members.\\n\r\nThe design isn't completely perfect though, yes the characters are well drawn, but not perfect. At times the movement looks simply unnatural (in a bad way), and the characters faces don't really look that good, especially the noses. Other than that it is pretty perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAnother one of Durarara's strong points. The voices of the many voice actors all fit perfectly to their characters, and the acting is also performed commendably. This is one of the few times you will notice e saying, that all the voice actors improved the enjoyment, since all of them gave their characters more personality, and changing even one of them might have caused the series to suffer.\\n\r\nThe great voices are also backed up by the great back ground music, the music style is good, and the songs are also good and memorable. Aside from the first outro, I actually enjoyed all the music Durarara had to offer, and that doesn't happen that often.\\n\\n\r\nTheme:\\n\r\nThe different themes of Durarara are, friendship, love, trust, humor, and gang wars, even though there is little to no action in here. Throw in a couple of fantasy aspects, and you're left with an amazing package. There is something in here for pretty much everyone, and it is likely that most of the people who see this, will fall in love with one of these aspects, and you can't really blame them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nMy enjoyment of this show should be pretty obvious by now: I loved it. Durarara is easily one of my favorite animes, if not even favorite shows all together. I enjoyed every one of the 24 episodes, and I will remember this for a long time. The rewatch value is also extremely high, and though it doesn't exactly get better every time, it also doesn't at all get any worse.\\n\r\nThis package contains loveable characters, a great story, enjoyable music, and everything required to be called as good as perfect. There are almost no flaws, and they are not at all worth mentioning. There's never a boring period, where you wish that something new would happen, the pacing is simply amazing. Therefor I heavliy recommend watching this. With the great, and satisfying ending I don't know if there should be a sequel or not. I want one beacause I want to see the characters again, and I want to know what happened afterwards, but if it isn't as good as this, then it would be a major downer. Therefore; watch this show, I recommend it as much as I possibly can, it's just that good.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\t\t10\\n\r\nCharacters:\t10\\n\r\nDesign:\t         9\\n\r\nSound:\t        10\\n\r\nTheme:\t        10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\t10\\n\r\nOverall:\t        10",

One thing for sure Durarara!! definitely has an orginal story.\r\nArt 8/10:\r\nArt of the Durarara!! Is incredibly solid, the animation is fluid, the characters look great, even our headless heroine doesn\u2019t seem out of place. Ikebukuro looks incredibly realistic, the crowds on the streets, the lights,  it really seems real, and that\u2019s the artstyle Durarara!! Creators chose \u2013 characters look like normal people(that doesn\u2019t mean they areboring, more like believable), no bright flashing colours during the fights. And I have to say, even thought one of the characters doesn\u2019t have a head, another one has superhuman strength it seems very realistic, thanks to the artstyle\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nDurarara!!\u2019s openings and endings are very good \u2013 the first opening is truly a masterpiece, the first ending became a meme(but mostly due to animation). The second opening was solid, and 2nd ending has a great song. The OST was by comprasion quite medicore, the music repeated itself very often, and none of the tracks were truly memorable. The voice acting was great \u2013 especially Shizuo and Izaya. Its also worth noting that the Eng Dub of this anime is actually GREAT. I actually liked English Celty more than Japanese one, rest of the characters are either equal or only slightly worse than orginal. Trust me if you want to watch an eng dub, Durarara!! Is a great one to pick.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely the strongest point of Durarara!! The cast of characters is HUGE \u2013 and that can be a downside for some people(it was for me).  Even the characters that might seem like boring clich\u00e9s(the shy,weak,quiet male protagonist and his loud, outgoing, strong friend) have their own secrets. Because of the storytelling style of Durarara!!(more on that in story part), the \u201cbad guys\u201d have allot of screentime and are well developed with their own motivations, heck some people will no doubt disagree if I told them who I consider the villain in the story. Some of the more memorable/unique characters are:  Shizuo- the bodyguard that dresses like a bartender, has superhuman strength (throwing vending machines like a boss), who hates violence, but always ends up fighting, Izaya: the intelligent, but slightly crazy information broker who just loves watching peoples reaction to crazy situations( the famous cellphone jumping scene), loves pissing off Shizuo. And ofcourse Celty, a female dullahan that actually has quite sweet personality, and that\u2019s just three characters of Durarara!!\u2019s massive cast(albeit those 3 are definitely the most interesting ones)\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOnly 8? Let me explain. While the story is incredibly orginal, and well.. good, it\u2019s the storytelling and the massive cast that lowered the score from 9(for me). Durara!! Essentialy follows 4 or more character groups at the same time, eventually merging them really late in the series. I always personaly hated that kind of storytelling \u2013 there will always be 1-2 characters you care about/like much more than the others, which makes me stop paying attention to other character arcs, and just wishing I could watch my favourite characters again. This might be a plus for some people but it was a minus for me. This also affected the enjoyment score. The ending leaves allot of questions unanserwed ( but offers some closure) \u2013 there is definitely room for season two(which hasn\u2019t been announced yet, WHY?)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching Durarara!!. It didn\u2019t have me hooked like the shows that I rated higher, but I enjoyed every single ep. I watched. While the storytelling style choice didn\u2019t fit my preferences, I still liked the show quite a bit. The unique story and solid art,sound and animation made the experience of watching this anime really nice one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nDurarara!! Is very solid and has an unique story, aswell as a huge character cast(everyone is bound to find at least a few characters they will like). It\u2019s a show I can recommend to almost everybody, from yaoi fangirls to boys raised on watching Dragonball. I can see why some people will rate this show higher, it can definitely get a 9 if you like Durarara!!\u2019s storytelling and shows that have allot of characters",

At first I was turned off by how confusing and plot-less the story was, but after somehow managing to watch a third of it, everything really starts to kick into gear. Durarara!! is about many different people with many different lifestyles within the Tokyo district Ikebukuro, and surely enough the rich character development becomes the centerpiece of this anime's enjoyment as you unravel the truth each major character.\r\nStory: 7\r\nAs I mentioned above, there story was largely plot-less in the first third. This is not to saythis makes it a terrible terrible anime, just that its something you have to kind of push through. Honestly, if you were to ask me, \"so whats it about?\" I wouldn't be able to answer without giving you an essay. In the simplest words, Durarara!! is about 7-8 people whos' fates become cleverly intertwined.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nClean lines and soft colors. Good balance of dark colors--much of the settings in this anime are in the evening and at night.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI am very impressed with the music. Music is unique, fun, and memorable. That's all you can ask for.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, the characters are what make this anime great. Just to name a few, we have a couple of high school kids (the main characters), a Russian sushi chef, a mysterious \"headless rider\", and an inhumanly strong bartender.  These characters not only make the district of Ikebukuro interesting, but make the anime exciting as well. Over the course of the anime, you get to unravel the pasts of each character, and take a trip into their struggles that shape them into who they are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nIt's fun--plain and simple.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nGreat anime with a lot of character depth. For those of you who've seen Baccano!, personally I don't think this anime is as good but you can definitely see Narita's unique writing style that makes the anime magically get really good by the end. Definitely worth a watch!",
