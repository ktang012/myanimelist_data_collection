            "content": "In my review of season 1, I suggested saluting the Japanese flag. Well, it looks like the writers decided to give me a hand because the ending now contains a Japanese flag flying gloriously. Plus fantasy girls in military gear in various military activities, having tons of fun. In fact, the military is portrayed as so fun we should all join. Play around in the bath and get the complimentary harem. Sounds legit to me.\r\n...Anyway, season 2 picks up where the last one left off. Beyond the titular gate is a fantasy land with elves, dragons, catgirls and whatnot. The place has been annexed byJapan and with much creativity and sensitivity named the Special Region. Now the virtuous Japanese Self-Defence Force (SDF) proceeds to help the local population against tyranny and oppression. And they carry it out honorably despite being hindered by incompetent politicians, propaganda-spewing journalists, and other countries such as the US who like to mess with Japan's business.\\n\\n\r\nWhat? The Japanese constitution forbids using the SDF abroad? Don't be silly. If you annex the place, it counts as part of Japan, duh. Or maybe since the gate is inside Japan, they decided all its contents are too. If they have a team of lawyers, I'd like to hire them too.\\n\\n\r\nPlus they loot, err I mean procure, whatever natural resources there are in the area. That's right; Japan strikes oil. Get rekt, Middle East. The local lords had no idea oil is even valuable when they signed the mining deal. Suckers.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might expect, the SDF wrecks the natives with ease. Again. Which is not really surprising because the local royalty and feudal lords have not learned much in the ways of warfare or diplomacy. Actually, forget the guns; they can't even match the SDF in a fistfight. And when the SDF isn't overpowered enough, the otaku protagonist's harem of mages and demigod lolis swoops in and wins in a few seconds. There is also a CGI dragon that is thankfully at least a bit more challenging, and that is probably the reason why it exists in the plot to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the best cure for psychological trauma is apparently revenge, best achieved by having a traumatized person operate a bazooka. What could possibly go wrong?\\n\\n\r\nThe timing of the comedy and drama is brilliant, with random fanservice right next to slavery and war crimes (not committed by the SDF, don't worry). Just the way I like it. Romance is also handled with subtlety: near the end we even get a montage of all the latest crack pairings.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you are looking for lots of fanservice, explosions and nationalistic right-wing sentiment, this is the anime for you. Season 3 hype?",

            "content": "Every so and often, we come across a series where there\u2019s some controversy. Anime isn\u2019t shy to take risks and so we have stories that involves the military, politics, prostitution, and slavery. Putting that aside, a show is also capable of capitalizing on these risks and turn it into something of a blessing in disguise. Gate Jieitai Kanochi nite Kaku Tatakaeri 2nd Season is one of these shows.\r\nReturning for a second season, GATE focuses on two major arcs. A few things first though. The series has already build a lot with the first season as we were introduced to Itami Youji, a lieutenant from theGround Self-Defense Force. Also known for his otaku characteristics, Itami\u2019s encounter on the other side of the world (beyond the GATE as I\u2019d like to call it) leads to extraordinary discoveries. Elves, mages, dragons, and even demi-gods. These are just a few of the otherworldly that Itami encounters. Of course, between the two worlds, there\u2019s also a lot of conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThe conflict continues into GATE Season 2. The first few episodes also sets up for quite a bit of events for the reminder course of the story. Characters such as Zorzal El Caesar (first prince of the Empire) and Tyuule (ruler of the warrior bunnies) are just a few that causes controversy. The emperor of the Empire also seems to be planning for big things while Pina still tries to maintain a state of peace between the two worlds. Then, there\u2019s also characters like Sherry Tyueli, a young girl who has a surprisingly crafty mind. GATE Season 2 introduces a variety of characters to instill the purpose of role diversity. It also goes to show that characters of any age, gender, or race can potentially influence a great deal in the story.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Itami is still the main guy along with the three girls that we fondly adores from the first season. Furthermore, Itami\u2019s relationship in particular with Tuka seems to have grown much deeper in one of the later episodes. Lelei development as a mage is also evident as we witness her skills against even an almighty dragon during the Red Dragon Arc. And who can forget about Rory? The ever so cunning demi-god also develops a special connection with Itami as she gets involved with an old rival. In essence, every main girl shines in their way while Itami still plays the role of being the leader of the squad. In the meantime, there\u2019s a lot of political tension building up that really makes the second season darker than it seems.\\n\\n\r\nThese include attempted assassinations, human slavery, and a plot to overthrow the empire within its own forces. If you remember Pina, she also becomes entrenched with controversial affairs that takes unexpected dark turns. It goes to say that GATE still maintains what it tries to do \u2013 developing story episode by episode while feeding a lot of its ideas towards a climax. It works out quite well once we realize the purpose of its intent. And while it\u2019s at it, GATE isn\u2019t afraid to show death and make it into a reality. War exists \u2013 both in the fantasy and real world with GATE still developing on that throughout the season. Also, don\u2019t forget that the show has a lot of military themes and we can easily see how Japan adapts its propaganda fueled by its technological arsenal. Also, it\u2019s noticeable that GATE continuously maintain a high level of world building. It\u2019s easily recognized and has always been one of the show\u2019s stronger points. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike the first season, the sequel has less comedy and much more on plot emphasis. By the third or fourth episode, I think it\u2019s easy to adapt with the style as the show has already introduced enough concepts. But like most adaptations, the show does omit some material although nothing too crucial. Some of the more controversial content like sexual slavery and abuse is subtly hinted at while there\u2019s less gore. In addition, pacing becomes somewhat rushed in a few episodes. With the story that introduces new characters, it\u2019s not always easy to like them. Zorzal is likely to become one of the most hated characters for his cruel actions. In addition, some of the content such as sex may be uncomfortable to sink into your mind. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style of GATE generally remains the same. As I mentioned before, the world building is one of the strongest aspects of the show and we get a good amount of quality of the fantasy world. From powerful looking dragons to artistically decorated structures, the show knows where to go for when it comes to fantasy content. This also extends to character designs that really shows their distinctive appearances. From bunny warriors to apostles, you can expect a lot of unique ways the show does to make characters look different. Similar to the first season, there\u2019s also some realistic content like with Japan\u2019s military. From impressive fighter jets to heavy duty mortars, the show demonstrates what military is really capable of. Supplementing its impressive technical features, the soundtrack of season 2 retains its style that fans are used to. The OP song has a familiar tune while the majority of the action choreography is nicely performed with its stellar OST. Character voice mannerism is also noticeable with Zorzal\u2019s egoistic nature, Tyueli\u2019s manipulative personality, or Noriko\u2019s innocence.  \\n\\n\r\nWell, I can\u2019t say that season 2 of GATE is miles better than what the first season offered. However, what it does have is concrete storytelling that builds more and more. It makes viewers anticipate what\u2019s to happen next while skillfully adapt with some of its controversial content. I am a bit disappointed that it does omit certain content though. (read the LN and manga for more details) And to add on to the fire, GATE still has characters that can make people pull their hairs out. That aside, GATE Season 2 maintains a nice balance of storytelling and characters. With less comedy and more serious business picking up, it\u2019s a show that just keeps on giving.\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Gate: And So the Second Round of Propaganda begins\"\r\n^^ is honestly a fitting title for this show. \r\nWhy? There's more JSDF propaganda in this season than the previous season. That doesn't make me love this show less, however. Also, when I say JSDF propaganda, I didn't mean that in a bad way. It's Japan's show so they can do whatever the hell they want. Hypocrites who criticizes this show for the amount of JSDF propaganda makes me sick because they're the same people who watches American films that also contains some (sometimes a lot of) U.S Army Propaganda. \r\n(There will be some SPOILERS in myreview)\\n\\n\r\n[Story]: (8/10)\\n\r\nI'm a big fan of the first season of GATE and I absolutely loved the show. When they decided to split the show into 2 cour, I was patiently waiting (and dying) for the Second Season every single day for 2-3 months before it aired. I was like one of those fanboys screaming like a girl...I was just so excited. Now that the series has finished airing, is it better than the first season and was my waiting justified? You'll find out soon enough. \\n\\n\r\nThe 2nd Season of GATE continues from where the 1st Season left off and is picked up from there. The show is separated into two arcs and adapts the \"Fire Dragon\" arc and the \"Douran\" arc. Let's focus on the most anticipated \"Fire Dragon\" arc. \\n\\n\r\nI was really hyped for this arc when I found out that they weren't going to continue it in the first season. Mostly because I wanted to see Itami, his hare -- *ahem* I mean, the girls that he rescued and his platoon fight off the Fire Dragon. However, the 2nd Season didn't really start off with the \"Fire Dragon\" arc just yet. It starts off with the Japanese Senators and the JSDF holding a peace talks with the Empire. They also began to maintain peace towards the civilians and their first step to try and improve the lives of the civilians is by setting up a Healthcare System. Now this is where the actual arc begins. \\n\\n\r\nAhh, the \"Fire Dragon\" arc..So what did I think about this arc? For the most part, it was good but not great. In the first season, Tuka's father died and we all knew that except her. When a certain someone decided to open Tuka's eyes and forced her to face the reality, she entered into a horrible state of PTSD. That's actually the first time this show made me feel sympathetic for someone else. Itami then decided to do the unthinkable so she doesn't have to face the reality which is a horrible way to deal with someone's PTSD. I gotta give props to Itami though for being a badass but people needs to face the reality sooner or later so Yao kind of did the right thing. Here's the part that I don't like. I didn't really like the way they handled Itami's past to try and relate to Tuka losing her father. Appearantly, something similar happened to Itami's parents and that's the whole reason why Itami helped Tuka kill the Fire Dragon. It was done really poorly and it's like they pulled that backstory out of their ass. That backstory wasn't explored properly, it wasn't expanded and they only spent a short amount of time which makes his backstory seems like an asspull. The arc got a nice payoff though which makes me want to forgive some of the arc's flaws. It's what I always wanted to see and I got it. The JASDF (Japanese Air Self Defence Force) raining down democracy and freedom and the JGSDF (Japanese Ground Self Defence Force) goes there to show us what happens if you mess with the JSDF.  \\n\\n\r\nThe next arc is the \"Douran\" arc. I was actually surprised that they adapted this arc. I mean, when they advertised the second season, they only showed the Fire Dragon arc on the trailers so I thought that arc would have lasted for like the whole season. Anyways, this arc focuses on two events. The first event is Itami accompanying Lelei to a town that looks so futuristic but it's not. To be more specific, it's an Academy City that trains mages. The second event is a coup inside the Empire in an attempt to destroy the peace between the Empire and Japan. Honestly, this arc is slightly better than the first arc because a lot more things happened here than the Fire Dragon arc and also a lot of politics are involved in this arc and how it plays a huge role. For example, we get to see why the JSDF wasn't deployed earlier to save the Japanese Senators and why they didn't liberate the Empire sooner.\\n\\n\r\nI talked about the pacing issues in my first season's review and I want to talk about the pacing issues in this review again. Just like the first season, the first arc was rushed and the 2nd half was still somewhat rushed but not too much. They shouldn't have rushed the 1st half because that's the whole reason why I didn't like the Fire Dragon arc that much even though we got a nice payoff at the end of the arc. Instead of rushing the arc, they should have spend more time on Tuka's PTSD and Itami's backstory which would have made a huge impact at the end if those 2 things were expanded. I have no issues with the 2nd half's somewhat rushed pacing because it's mostly politics and Itami's journey to a mage town and what he and the girls did in that town. \\n\\n\r\nI'm sure you noticed this when you watched the first episode but Gate Season 2's atmosphere sure is a lot darker than the previous season. I actually never expected Gate to touch on subjects like Rape, Abuse, and etc. They're obviously censored but they're still somewhat disturbing as shit. \\n\\n\r\nNow I want to talk about a couple of issues that I have with the 2nd Season of Gate. First is pacing issues and I already talked about it so I'll skip to the second issue. The second issue is the side characters not getting enough screentime and by side characters, I mean the soldiers in Itami's platoon not getting enough screentime at all. I really liked their character interactions and their interesting personalities in the first season but in this season, most of their screentime was taken away by Itami's harem... The final issue that I have is the ending. It was cheesy as hell and it made it look like an ad saying \"Join the JSDF and you'll get a waifu for your war efforts\". I have no problem with JSDF Propaganda but that scene was really cringy as fuck.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe 2nd Season\u2019s art and visuals looks exactly the same as the first season and no surprise there as the show was originally intended to be 24 episodes. So because of that, my ratings for this section will stay the same. There is something weird with how the background was coloured. Remember when you used to colour those colouring books and no matter how hard you colour, there will always be a few white small dots left? That\u2019s what the background looked like which made it seem like A-1 Pictures\u2019 budget was running dry or they ran out of time. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nJust like the Animation, every soundtrack were re-used from the first season. Although, I don\u2019t have any complaints with the soundtrack since they weren\u2019t bad to begin with. In fact, I preferred they kept the soundtrack because they\u2019re goddamn amazing and it gives me goosebumps all the time. Especially that soundtrack that plays when the JSDF shows up and gives those Empire bastards and the Fire Dragons a sweet taste of democracy and freedom that we all take for granted. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \u201cGATE II: Sekai wo Koete \u201c by the Akeboshi Rockets. Ok, I gotta give the Akeboshi Rockets a props for changing how their latest song plays and sounds. There\u2019s still the usual drumbeats at the beginning but at least it doesn\u2019t sound the same as HOTD\u2019s first 5 sec of the OP. Overall, the song was nice but I have a problem with the OP Animation. 90% of the scenes are re-used scenes from the first season, 5% are ripped off from their another show\u2019s OP 1 \u201cThe Asterisk War\u201d, and the last 5% are a bunch of character\u2019s face shots. Talk about being lazy or running out of ideas. \\n\r\nThe ED theme song is \u201cItsu Datte Communication\u201d by Lelei, Tuka and Rory. I really love Gate's 2nd ED theme song. It sounds so much better than that funky 1st ED theme song. It's not like I hated the 1st ED theme song. In fact, I loved it, I just prefer the 2nd ED. I love it when Lelei, Tuka, and Rory are singing together which was the reason why I loved the 1st ED of Gate. Same case here..The song is relaxing and it just sounds so beautiful. Hell, I wouldn't mind if they form an idol group. Now, in terms of the ED Animation. Hands down, their best ED Animation yet. In the 1st ED, it's just a simple Humvee riding in a tunnel with glowing lights. In here, the ED Animation is also simple but it's hilarious at the same time. Call it a propaganda shots or whatever the hell you want but I really don't give a shit what you think. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (8/10)\\n\r\nIn the previous season, a new character was introduced almost at the end of the first season. All we knew about her is she ventured out to search for the \"Green People\" or in other words, the JSDF to ask for the help in killing the Fire Dragon. In here, we get to know more about her personality during the Fire Dragon arc like how she's an asshole and does not have sympathy towards another person's feeling. It seems like she does but the way she's handling it makes her look like a bitchy, selfish, insensitive person by telling Tuka the whole truth about the fate of his father. This, however, makes Itami look like a badass by pretending to be Tuka's father. Even though he will \"put his hobby over work any day\", he did his duty as a JSDF soldier to help out Tuka. Itami felt empathy towards Tuka because he knows what it feels like to lose a parent. Like I said above though, Itami's backstory about his parents seems like an asspull and for that reason, Itami's empathy towards Tuka did not leave that much of an impact to me....It did leave a little bit of an impact to me though. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Tuka got much of a spotlight in the Fire Dragon arc to give development to her character, the show also focused on Lelei during the \"Douran\" arc. We learned that Lelei has a sister who fails at everything than her sister in every conceivable way. Though, I understand now why Lelei's teacher (in S1, Ep. 3) would rather \"mount a curvy woman like her\". She has the hots but she's one of those typical dumb blondes expect she's not dumb. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8/10)\\n\r\nI still enjoyed the 2nd Season of Gate but I didn't enjoy it as much as the first season of Gate. Just like the previous season though, I did enjoy the military aspect of the show because military in animes are portrayed as an incompetent unit who can't stand for themselves whereas in Gate, it's vice versa. I'm also a big military enthusiast so that part of me contributed to my enjoyment for this show. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Gate: And So the Special Defence Force Fought There - Season 2\" is a good sequel that finally concludes the story of Gate. I am aware that the Light Novel still has some stories to be told like \"The Civil War\" arc but I'm satisfied with how the anime version ended. I'm also happy that they finally explained how the \"Gate\" works which I thought would never happen. If you watched the 1st Season of Gate and you enjoyed it then this season is a must watch. Don't expect it to be better than the first season though. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.4/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Show's atmosphere is darker than the previous season\\n\r\n+Well-Done Story\\n\r\n+Great Animation\\n\r\n+A-1 Pictures kept the amazing soundtrack\\n\r\n+Tuka and Lelei's character development\\n\r\n+Just like the last season, portrayal of JSDF and their weaponry/military vehicles are almost realistic.\\n\r\n+They finally explained how the \"Gate\" works\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Pacing issues\\n\r\n-Itami's backstory seems like an asspull\\n\r\n-Itami's platoon did not get enough screentime",

            "content": "Dude. This anime is such garbage, oh my god.  \r\nSo, at first, I didn't realize that this was psychotically upbeat right-wing fascist, nationalist, militaristic propaganda set as a harem comedy rife with the slaughter of hundreds (if not thousands). Unfortunately, it also kind of got me hooked. \r\nI got pretty into season one, laughing hysterically about the insane murder sprees that this \"JSDF\" (apparently what the Japanese Military is called?) got into. They mowed down legions of iron-age soldiers and... nobody seems to mind? Where are their families? I also had some fun with the classic trope: \"they're actually hundreds of years old, soit's okay that they look like 15 year olds!\" with the harem characters. Cute. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, it's a harem anime. Whatever. It's very paint-by-numbers. All the girls are obsessed with our hero, Itami, who can do absolutely no wrong. This doesn't change in the second season, and, in fact, his little harem gets even bigger! Also, the blonde one calls him daddy. Isn't that adorable?  Unfortunately, our harem anime is also set to a backdrop of wanton murder and destruction, including battles that cost the lives of thousands of civilians, destroy entire cities, obliterate a much less developed people and paint the invaders as... the good guys? \\n\\n\r\nThey don't seem to lose a single soldier, but have no qualms with mowing down thousands. This is fucking terrifying. At first it was kind of... almost justified... but we're fuck deep in season two. This kind of murder and militaristic psychosis is absolutely disgusting at this point. I keep thinking it will slow down... and it doesn't... \\n\\n\r\nAlso, what the shit is wrong with everyone in fantasy land? None of their decisions make a lick of sense! They have to be practically force fed peace negotiations with a nation that crushes them like ants. The goal is obviously to make the JSDF look smart and generous by comparison, but it ends up just looking like a bunch of Japanese diplomats discussing foreign policy with toddlers. \\n\\n\r\nToddlers that they're threatening to kill. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty enough, most of the time, if boring. Then we get the tech porn. \\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely beautiful designs, faithful, true-to-life reproductions, gorgeous cells and flawless animation of tanks, helicopters, bazookas, machine guns, humvees, fighter jets and more. Honestly? This anime would be a thousand times better if they just cut all the pretty military porn out and set it to a good song. I'd watch that. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nForgettable, but fairly satisfying. They also re-use the same tracks over and over again. The intro and outro songs are boring and skippable. Nothing worth buying, that's for sure. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is what finally stopped me being able to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nI was invested. In the characters. I'll be honest, I'm spoiled rotten. Magical girl anime like PMMM and genre-changing hero anime like OPM have got me expecting a LOT from modern anime. Characters that break molds, situations that go from fun to dire in moments, expansive worlds and interesting art styles... this is what anime has been giving us over the past decade or so. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in anime have risen above their tropes in a multitude of ways. I kept expecting that to happen here. I kept waiting. And waiting. And WAITING. And I finally realized. \\n\\n\r\nNone of them were going to get a single modicum of growth. \\n\\n\r\nIt's disappointing. I can imagine so many ways in which all of these characters could have broken their chains. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS BELOW (but please read, before you have to see it with your eyes)\\n\\n\r\nI realized this, at the end of episode eight, when a 12 year old girl is begging for her adult crush to save her from what is insinuated as sexual slavery and possibly death. \\n\\n\r\nHe does so... not because she is a tiny child and needs his help, but because she has a crush on him. He finally says that, when she's sixteen, he'll marry her. He is painted as a hero for doing so, and he even almost gives her a kiss. Their relationship is exceptionally pedophilic and disturbing, and it is portrayed as absolute perfection and heroism. I am thoroughly disgusted, and that's what made me realize that this anime was incapable of showing character growth. \\n\\n\r\nIf they can make an adult (I'm talking in his thirties) man seem like a hero for deciding to fuck a twelve-year-old... then this anime has no idea what a decent person even looks like.  \\n\\n\r\n(And to counter the \"but when she's sixteen!!!11\" argument, *why* make her twelve, then? Why not just make her sixteen and cut out the middle man? I'll tell you why. It's to insinuate that sexualizing a twelve-year-old is okie-dokie as long as you wait to hump until she hits the age of consent... sorta. EUGH! Inexcusable.)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime CANNOT show a truly good person, or even a truly complex person, because it is written by pedophilic, nationalistic otakus who masturbate to pictures of guns and drawings of little girls. \\n\\n\r\nI am mentally scarred by seeing that with my own two eyeballs. I don't even want to see any more. I don't think I can take it. At least with the other fanservice lolitas they made an ATTEMPT to portray them as \"older\". Nine hundred years old, my ass. But with this one!? She's a literal, physical baby! She might not even have hit puberty! I *still* taste vomit. \\n\\n\r\nEND SPOILERS\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly? The first two episodes of season one are almost worth the watch. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the pedophilia, militarism, genocide and nationalism shown in the rest of the anime absolutely outweigh any enjoyment I got from this. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is not interesting. It is not groundbreaking. It is barely functional. It is completely disgusting in every possible way. I was sucked in by a premise which never delivers. \\n\\n\r\nI hate all the characters so much, at one point I was rooting for them all to be outright decimated by a fucking dragon. I regret everything I have done that led to me watching this pos anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAwful. The two points are for the decent animation and good premise. The story, characters and all the things that make anime interesting and fun were missing or perverted. \\n\\n\r\nI should have quit at season one. I should have quit before I started! Don't make my mistake, you sweet, innocent creatures. Fly! Fly, you fools! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review is for the first season and the second season of GATE.\r\nFor a while, I had a habit of watching an episode or two of anime before I went to sleep, especially when I did not have something early to do the next day.  Since GATE came out every Friday, I decided that it was the best show to fill the pre-sleep role.  There would be no chance of accidentally binge watching fifty episodes because there would only be one episode available each day.\r\nThat was the worst decision I ever made.\r\nGATE has one of the suckiest stories I have ever watched.However, the way in which it sucks is surprising.  It has good scenario writing.  It also integrates political intrigue and military strategy masterfully, thus creating a story that is smarter than most anime out there.  So what failed?\\n\\n\r\nI think the fundamental premise is what fails.  GATE follows the story of Itami a Lieutenant in the Japanese army.  A hole in space-time in Tokyo opens to another world, one with magic, elves, dragons, and most importantly, undeveloped technology.  The Japanese army proceeds to subjugate the other side (both militarily and culturally) to \u201chelp the natives\u201d, fighting against swords with helicopters.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile all that is going on, GATE tries its best to portray the realities of war, never shying away from gore, prostitution, slavery, and slaughter.  However, in order to make it palatable to the anime audience, GATE also sets out to incorporate harem and slice of life elements into it.  So one moment, people\u2019s heads are getting blown off.  The next moment, Itami is getting doted on by a bunch of cute girls (this part is especially weird; GATE seems to want to fulfill every fetish there is).\\n\\n\r\nThis conflict between light and dark subjects is something that GATE had to resolve with the premise that it had.  It chose to solve this conflict by making the tone of the show light-hearted.   \\n\\n\r\nAs an example, here\u2019s a minor spoiler.  The JSDF (the fictional section of the Japanese military Itami is in) swoop into a city to rescue a princess from a siege, and they do this by mowing down an entire regiment of the opposing army with helicopters and machine guns, all while \u201cRide of the Valkyries\u201d is playing in the background.  If you\u2019re curious what that is, it goes da-da-da DUN DUN\u2026ok that doesn\u2019t help, but it\u2019s that song that plays in every movie when something triumphant happens.  \\n\\n\r\nThere are tons of other scenes like this in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, we might find it fun to watch.  It\u2019s kind of like a video game, right?  The targets are getting mowed down, and after a few more kills, we might get a killstreak prize (a tactical nuke!  Brag about it to your friends).  It\u2019s textbook wish fulfillment.  However, if we think about it, it\u2019s actually messed up.  Helpless soldiers on the other side are seen as justifiably stomped on, while the JSDF is seen as the benevolent civilizer.  But shouldn\u2019t it be the other way around?  Shouldn\u2019t the strong be condemned for bullying the weak?  Shouldn\u2019t the JSDF be portrayed as evil, not the opposing army?\\n\\n\r\nOf course, these are just fictional characters and no one is actually dying.  However, consider this: GATE was written by a person who used to be in the Japanese military, and is sometimes shown to Japanese military recruits.  When viewed in that light, the choice to employ a light tone in GATE feels rather manipulative.  The show tries to make us feel as if basic human rights violations are OK, using cute girls, a bright color palette, and some clever villain characterization.  In other words, GATE uses wish fulfillment to justify the unethical things that happen inside it. \\n\\n\r\nIn doing so, GATE is manipulating the minds of its audience.  The show tries to get us to turn a blind eye to military transgressions, passing them off as \u201coh, the enemy king is EEEVIL\u201d or \u201cthere was no helping it\u201d.  Eventually this leads to \u201cthe army can do no wrong\u201d.  That\u2019s dangerous.  If you\u2019re not convinced that media can influence thinking, just look at North Korea.  Somehow, the media there has convinced its people that The Fearless Leader doesn\u2019t poop.  \\n\\n\r\nSomething about all this doesn\u2019t sit well with me.  Part of the assumption that GATE makes in its propaganda campaign is that as long as there\u2019s cute girls, violence, and an interesting story, anime viewers are fine with whatever goes on.  No way that\u2019s true.  At least, I hope that it\u2019s not true.  \\n\\n\r\nThis show\u2019s problem lies not in its quality.  It lies in its ethics.  If you\u2019re going to watch, you\u2019ll have to make a decision.  You can equip critical thinking glasses, and in doing so realize that you hate being manipulated.  Or you can watch brainlessly.  Just understand the risks if you choose the latter option.\\n",

            "content": "Again A-1 Pictures has blessed us with another crappy adaptation of a light novel in a fantasy world as I\u00b4m reviewing the second core this will be a review of the entire series, I\u00b4m sry if my english isn\u00b4t the best since it\u00b4s not my mother language I\u00b4ll just try to make my points across as to why you shouldn\u00b4t watch this show.\r\nStory-2\r\nThe premise sounds cool but thats basically where the good stuff about Gate ends, the first episode was a poor introduction to the series as its the story of Itami, an otaku (for some reason because it\u00b4s completely irrelevant to the story) whois coincidentally a member of the JSDF (Japan Self-Defence Forces), he is caught in an attack from forces of the other side of the Gate, this was the first pointer to the terrible script writing this anime has. We are never given a clue to his position on the episode, he is first buying otaku goods then he is shown helping citizens and in a couple of minutes the all attack is resolved by JSDF reinforcements and it is shown Itami getting praised by his duty. The all story is basically a poundering to otakus and Japan\u00b4s military and politics while making the forces from the other gate, the media and even the United States look like bad guys. The JSDF enters the other side of the gate with the excuse of the first attack on them and the fact that they took some of their civillians hostage but then proceed to try to dominate the area through peaceful ( so they don\u00b4t look bad) conversations and try to gain control of the new area\u00b4s resources based on the fact that they don\u00b4t have any knowledge on resources like oil being valuable. Then they proceed to show Japan\u00b4s politics taking the risk of ruining their public image just so they can do the right thing all when America is trying to gain some control over the area on the other side of the gate and the media trying to make the JSDF look bad in they eyes of the public. Can we also take a moment to think to how this anime tries to potray things like revenge as a good deed and a medicine to people with PTSD and looking edgy doing it like making the victim hold a god damn bazooka to a dragon for revenge. Also any sense of conflict is inexistent considering the fact that Itami is holding a gun with him 24/7 making any kind of threat meaningless to the characters that are walking with him also he looks confident in any situation so that\u00b4s also a turnoff to any danger that might be trying to attack him. The ending was a wishfulfillment when Itami can go back to his otaku life while being surrounded by his harem of fetish girls.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 2\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a trainwreck as well im into the second season right now and no character has undergone any kind of characterization or progress being that the show focuses more on the boring story, and no, Tuka\u00b4s characterization is shallow and rushed. Itami caring for the people around him is not charactarization either since he is a light novel protagonist and you\u00b4re supposed to picture yourself in his shoes he has to be protective towards everyone nice in the show. Also for a kinda medieval fantasy setting the characters act immature and kinda retarded like they are some highschoolers in a school setting, except for the JSDF that has to be series all the time to show how great our army is. Oh and that Dark Elf or something that fuked up Tuka\u00b4s life to get her revenge so that in the fight with the dragon more faceless weirdos from he tribe can die again oh yes what a good way to revenge my comrades by killing another bunch instead of idk moving them maybe.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 3\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also all over the place and with the most basic directing ever, excluding some episodes where it looked like a superheroes movie through weird transitions. The magic used is ridiculously laughable at how boring and stupid it looks, the mood changes drastically to a more serious tone when a fight with the JSDF breaks out but in a very poor manner sometimes they switch it around just because and we got to see the most intimidating CGI dragon since Fate/Stay Night. And the second OP reuses the same clips of the first as well as being badly directed as the first one like who would think that it\u00b4s not because the show is popular that A1 would start to care.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack - 4 \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also pretty bad they use the same track all the time when a crisis breaks and sometimes even use it completely out of context in some scenes, the more easy going music is pretty typical but kinda irritating like if the show isn\u00b4t stupid enough they have to emphacise it through the music.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion-\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Dont watch this show it\u00b4s not worth your time the first season was somewhat bearable taking into account they were still introducing the characters.\\n",

            "content": "Gate is quite the fantasy journey. It is also maybe one of the most controversial anime to come out in recent years due to it's propaganda. With the tone of \"Japan is super awesome\", it's no wonder that many people can't stomach it, but that's just the surface level. The other side of the coin is the fantasy. The other world that Gate displays is very alive and basically fun to immerse oneself in. While the setting had a lot going for it, the sequence of storytelling may be the downfall of what could be great instead of good. It was like a double edgedsword with it's pacing and which characters to focus on. I believed that the first season of gate was a show with good elements that didn't take the next or extra step. It tinkled with what it had and was ultimately somewhat of a let down. This second season manages to pick up where it left and continually build the world, but it suffers the same problems the first season did. Yet again, it manages to display some positive story telling but it doesn't go the next step, instead suffers from some fan service and awful arcs. \\n\\n\r\nNow we know Gate was incredibly controversial due to it taking a nationalistic approach. All the butthurt people watching it immediately put it out as one of those government pandering and that xenophobic mindset is hindered them from witnessing a good piece of fiction. The story is incredibly more rewarding in the second season compared to the first because it takes on a more political level, albeit simple in nature. We get more perspectives of the different factions involved, the nature of the government if one decision is made and all that jazz. It's quite cringey in some moments due to some of the cast of characters, but its fun to watch. One thing that may have been it's downfall however is the lack of screentime the main characters get. Gate's drastic change in story direction is hit or miss, with a few plot holes and pacing issues especially towards the end. And the end is quite the disappointment, not really concluding nor foreshadowing anything in the future. It's a fun story to follow, but don't expect ghost in the shell 2nd gig.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are not as interesting as they were in the first season. As previously stated, the screen time Itami and his gang got was diminished. They were pretty much the backbone of the show and without them, it was a lot of political jargon and more war. However, even with the little screen time they get, each of the characters get more depth to them and more meaningful. A lot of internal conflict drives the main characters, except rory who seems to be one of those characters that is there to appeal to the fans. Side characters even get some depth to them, although the half assed villains were quite the letdown. That might contribute to the poor conclusion. The storytelling may have been too ambitious because many side characters are still unknown and seem to play a key role in the main conflict.  I liked following Itami and gang more so than the other political junkies because they have fun interactions, more meaningful relationships, especially because their bond is what the story is basically trying to replicate. Character direction could've been improved, but a twelve episode season was just too little for something as big as gate was.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound is cool. The SFX for the guns and explosions were well placed, making the action scenes more inducing to the viewer. Expect lots of killing so even if you weren't a fan of what gate brought to the table in terms of story telling, you can enjoy the slaughterfest. Less emphasis on the sound, especially with that Apocalypse Now reference last season, this one was quite the letdown in terms of OST. Needed another epic battle scene with that kind of atmosphere, but hey it was there.\\n\\n\r\nGate once again could've been great but it just settled for good. Also PSA, people really need to look past the propaganda and pandering because in the end it's just fiction. Why would Japanese writers and studios want to do a project with something that undermines them? Had to get that off my chest because people will bash the series just because of that. Now the otaku pandering is a reasonable reason, but thankfully there's a lot less of that in this season. Gate is a really good fantasy, perhaps one of the better fantasy entries in the anime industry. It's handling of characters is good, the story is enthralling sometimes, and the animation is decent. It was a fun journey to be a part of and it's setting is good enough to immerse oneself in.",

            "content": "tl;dr: Entertaining show with likeable characters and impressive art and animation, but with a very questionable agenda.\r\nThough I enyoyed the first season overall, while watching I was wondering if the messages conveyed were just artifacts of the setting and the plot or by design. Well, 2nd season proceeded to quickly erase any doubts on my part: This anime has an agenda, and it's not pretty:\r\n- The mc impersonates the classic from the recruitment center: Joining the AF means an easy job with a respectable income, social securities and best of all, some adventure abroad on top. Military accomplishment is an sure-fire way to attract potencialmates.\\n\r\n- Blatant adoration for military might and technology: Miltech will save the day, always.\\n\r\n- Endorsement of violating other people's souvereignity to further Japan's agenda. We're the good guys!\\n\r\n- Journalists are men and women of business, not integrity. Generally a hindrance when it's about doing what has to be done, namely The Right Thing (TM). The same goes for politicians.\\n\r\n- Elitism: Confronted with the achievements of Japan, other people lose all ingenuity to deal with the overwhelming cultural and military might of JP.\\n\r\n- Other nations are to be trusted to plunge a dagger in your nations spine as soon as it's back is turned.\\n\r\n- Any action regardless how questionable, can be justified with the mission/mandate. \\n\\n\r\nIn concert with the recent real political agenda of Shinzo Abe to expand activities of the military beyond Japan's border, well... connect the dots and you get the picture, or rather, the propaganda.\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to miltary themes per se, I love Girls und Panzer. But this totally lacks any ironic twist. I find the manipulative trait of this show seriously offensive.",

            "content": "This is my first review on MyAnimeList. Typically I refrain from writing reviews simply because there are many more experienced users to do so. Here I felt compelled to write my own review to clarify a very annoying assumption about this show. I've seen several people allude to or directly state that Gate is promoting right wing Nationalism and Imoerialism, as well as theorizing that it is made as propaganda to support the reinterpretation of article 9 in Japan. This notion is simply irritating. here are some facts: Gate started in 2010, the reinterpretation was proposed and enforced in 2014, this anime is an adaptationof the light novel series, as such one would presume it would follow the same plot. So to say that this anime was made as propaganda is drawing a connection where one isn't neccessary when no one asked for it. War is literally the point of the story, if there wasn't an enemy or a conflict then there wouldn't be a novel series or show. Saying that this show is propaganda is as ridiculous as saying that The Hunger Games is propaganda encouraging kids to kill each other. Just chill and watch the show for what it is, a fun and thrilling story.\\n\r\nStory:10\\n\r\nso now let's talk about the story. It continues where the first season left off. Itami is alerted that Tuka is wandering around town in search of her late father. He decides to go in searcg if the dragon to slay it in hopes of snapping Tuka back to reality. The show's main plot here is pretty simple: hit the road and go on a quest to stay a dragon. The premise is simple but the execution is absolutely thrilling. \\n\r\nWhat really stands out in terms of plot is the sub story that has been happening behind the scenes. The Empire is destabilizing and some clear power struggles are emerging between the candidates for king and those close to them. The way this involves the Japanese Defense Force is extremely interesting to watch play out. As Japan tries to reach peace treaties, the Empire reaches another setback preventing the talks from progressing. I'lol leave it at that so as not to spoil any details.\\n\r\nArt: 8.5\\n\r\nA-1 has done very well with the animation for this show. Nearly all the character designs are visually appealing. The color pallete is bright bringing out the adventurous side of this fantasy world. The backgrounds are usually inc dinky animated. Where Gate falls short probably stems from budget and or time constraints. It is not particularly uncommon to see an off model character or a stoic expression from background characters. This is what holds the art back from being great. Otherwise the art is very modern and enjoyable, so as long as you can stand the weekly off model background character for a few seconds, the time when the art shines will most definitely make up for it (especially those fight scenes).\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Gate is very enjoyable, however, It is slightly underwhelming when compared to the first season. This is not because the second season lacks good music, it's simply because you cannot beat the incredible music of the first season: the original op, and the insert sing from the heli raid. That said the music is still very fitting for the show and never ceases to aide whatever tone the show is demonstrating. The voice actors are also all solid and Rory's seiyuu particular does a phenomenal job. \\n\r\nCharacter: 9 \\n\r\nIt's hard to rate the characters of Gate. Gate has a very large cast of characters, some of which are very well developed, some of which are underwhelming. One thing that is certain is that all,the characters in Gate are in an upward trend of development. \\n\r\nItami: a very interesting main character who continues to be laid back but never falls short when it comes to protecting those he cares about\\n\r\nRory: a very fun amd provocative character constantly teasing Itami. Not much development but still a very fun character.\\n\r\nTuka: a character You WANT to love, but seems slightly out of place until this season. I'm Season one she never contributed anything notable. And in the beginning of this season it seemed as though she was going to maintain an annoying trend, however in the finale of the dragon arc she finally proved her worth and gets a pass the inconvenience she caused.\\n\r\nLelei: a character who once was very boring and stereotypical, that recently became a temporary badass. It will be interesting to see how events in the finale of the dragon arc will impact her character progressing throughout the show.\\n\r\nThe last thing I will mention is the diverse and very exciting cast if side characters. I've never been as invested in every individual character nearly as much as Gate has made me care about it's side characters with the exception of two wild cards, Zolzal and Tyuule. So far each has the potential to be great characters if the team continues to maintain the current trend, I just hope we don't see them turn into stereotypical throwaway antagonists. But alas I have faith in A-1 yet.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis show is an incredibly fun watch and will have you waiting for the next episode each weak. Never short of drama and action this show still knows when to be lighthearted without the use of slapstick gags or piss poor humor. This season Gate continues to hit the mark of being an extremely fun show to watch. It may not be nearly as complex or well written as Fate/Zero or Steins; Gate, but its damn good at what it does and that's the simple fun of the show for that reason I rate it a 10. It is not a masterpiece in comparison to some of the classics. But for what it has tried to accomplished, it has exceeded any and all expectations Incould have had so far for this series. \\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\nIgnore the conspiracy theorists. This shows politics are not meant to be taken seriously, they are a very small but neccessary plot device to keep the show going. It IS NOT PROPOGANDA. the empire is a fictitious land, they are. It colonizing it. Sure they are searching for resources and taking advantage of trade but such is the reality of the world we live in regardless, the show never tried to convince anyone that these things are okay or that they aren't, it simply is not important. The show is a fantasy/action/military/adventure. If you came into this expecting 100% peaceful relations or a show where violence is not the response, ,aube you should try reading the tags or description of a show before you watch it. And if a show is not trying to make a point about anything, stop drawing unnecessary conclusions about simple plot devices. The real world has enough conspiracies as it is, stick to stuff that isn't completely fictional or fantasy, at the point is it really a problem with the show or the viewer? Amyways 99% of you out there will enjoy this show and some of you may love it like I do! I hope this review was helpful, I would love feedback, thank you",

            "content": "I find it remarkable how salty anime morans get when confronted by realistic scenarios inside a make-believe construct. Almost every negative review of Gate revolves around \"muh JSDF propaganda\" or \"muh fascism\" or \"muh waifus don't mix with this shiiiit muh muh muh.\" Unfortunately, I now see why normies hate anime culture so much: it easily ferments stupidity from ill-founded notions.\r\nTry this: an unknown, alien, and hostile force appears in the middle of a major city. They proceed to slaughter civilians by the thousands until being forced back. In response to the incursion and as a result of a stargate being present in the middleof a street downtown, the military sends expeditionary recon-in-force units through to ascertain where these people came from. After setting up camp they are attacked by hundreds of thousands of enemies with medieval-era technology. They defend themselves, annihilating almost all of the enemy because machine guns and artillery > wooden shields and steel swords.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing unrealistic or \"fascist\" about this. In fact, I found the JSDF to be incredibly restrained almost to the point of being unrealistic the other way. If this scenario were to be placed in New York City, Beijing, or Moscow, what would have happened? The recon-in-force would be several corps-size field armies with weapons far more sophisticated than 'Nam-era F-4s, 81mm mortars, and Type-74 tanks. The Empire would have been totally destroyed and a fake puppet government set up within weeks. Because that happened in reality against enemies with their own tanks, jets, and machine guns. Against horseback cavalry and pikemen it might even have been days.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, the same reviews bawling about \"muh fascism\" also complain about \"muh prominent Japanese flag all the time waaaaaaahhh\" because having pride in one's nation is now considered \"waah right wing boo hoooooo mommy.\" I'm actually astounded morans like this are capable of writing in complete sentences. But I'll leave that alone beyond this because apparently having different opinions is also fascist.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, Gate S1 and S2 are fantastic representations of two cultures clashing while one maintains dominant technological and moral superiority over the other. The main characters have a great range of personalities and objectives, and the dub cast voiced every single one perfectly. There are two issues I have outside of all the social commentary; first, S1 concludes with no ending, and S2 barely has one at all; second, S2 is weighed down with subplots buried within subplots. This is often the case with epic-level series--anime or live-action: subsequent seasons introduce too many narrative strings that can't be deftly handled within the runtime allotted. It doesn't prevent enjoyment in Gate's case, but it's certainly noticeable. I hope that if a third season ever gets produced it will return to the breezy charm of the first.\\n\\n\r\nBoth seasons of Gate are well worth your time. There's deep drama (that never, ever falls into the pit of melodrama) and hilarious hijinks weaved delicately through a meta-level story. There's something here for any mature adult.",

            "content": "There are no spoilers in this review. My rating system counts story for 30% of the total, characters as 30%, art as 20%, and 20% for the sound.\r\nI give this anime a 7.5 and I'll tell you why. For those looking for a brief summary, skip to the \u201cOverall\u201d at the bottom of this review. \r\nStory: 7 \r\nThe story of a new challenges arising as a result of a portal to another world opening up is not new. I\u2019ve seen it in World Trigger and I\u2019ve seen it in Zero no Tsukaima. What this anime did differently is make the other world technologicallyinferior to Japan, which I have never seen done before, and also delved into the politics of Japan as well as the new world. If not for this spin on the usual plot, I would have given the story a 6, but no matter it was not the story that carried this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and relationship between the characters were the best parts of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nItami is a brilliant commander and leader but dense when it comes to matters of love \u2013 the classic formula for the main character and center of a harem anime. For the first time, I actually didn\u2019t mind this stereotype. His lovable personality and refreshing decision to put his hobbies before work covered for his flaws. It is also nice that this anime didn\u2019t make his inability to detect romance the main focus of his screen time.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I include this in the sound rating, Rory\u2019s voice actor. Enough said. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe character design was fantastic. I love how they drew the different characters, but aside from that, the art wasn\u2019t anything special.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nIt is rare that I actually enjoy the theme music for an anime but this is a rare exception. The fact that the theme music was so epic, combined with Rory\u2019s voice actor, was enough to score this anime an 8 in sound. Lelei\u2019s voice actor had the perfect amount of innocence as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime so enjoyable to watch and gives it an even higher score than Erased and Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! is its ability to add original twists to an already proven formula. The classic invasion story was made more interesting by portraying the enemy to be clearly inferior to Japan and delving into the political intrigue of the new world. The main character of this harem anime acted as a fool when love was involved but rather than focusing on that minor detail, the anime focused on his reliability and general badassness.  The art and sound worked well together to bring out the charm and humor of the characters. A solid anime all around and I look forward to the next season.\\n",

            "content": "Review Text\r\nI'm going to review both the first and second season, so I'll just put my review here. The second season is pretty much the same as the first in terms of content and quality, if even less.\r\nStory - 2\r\nAssault rifles going against man in bronze armour armed with shield and pikes, and making a big deal out of it. Yup. Animated JSDF go on an absolute slaughterfest in an alternate world in the bronze age, and made out to be the good guys... and it's not propaganda... nope nope nope. =_=\r\nArt - 5\r\nArt is alright, not great, nothing to boast about.\r\nSound - 4\r\nvery realisticweapon sound, music timed well but mundane.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3\\n\\n\r\nOf character developments there were... none. Every supporting character sound like JSDF recruitment officers. Even the MCs only bobs up and down on the waves of the plot, taking no initiatives, The villain was actually the most developed character\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2\\n\\n\r\nIt's not all that bad, Japanese right winged nationalism notwithstanding. There was some GGRM-esque sprouts of political intrigue in the manga original, and fewer in the first anime season, but they were quickly snipped in the bud in favour of scenes of outright massacre.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"good\" guys completely slaughters the \"bad\" guys from the get-go. The enjoyment derives from the same kind of satisfaction you'd feel after swatting a  gnat. It's basically the whole story.\\n\\n\r\nAll the enemy commanders are idiots, all your allies are geniuses with a heart of gold and nerves of steel, even the lolis (on your side) are mastermind diplomats, and the Japanese army is nothing if not the very definition of humanitarianism.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, one little plus for the continued reference to the fate/stay night series, a pleasant surprise. Bumping the score from 1 to 2 for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3.5\\n\\n\r\n3 is poor and 4 is decent, and this is almost decent, thus 3.5.\\n\\n\r\n[As per wikipedia: Propaganda is a form of biased communication, aimed at promoting or demoting certain views, perceptions or agendas.]\\n\\n\r\nHad the Chinese made an anime (ignore for a moment the fact that non-indie Chinese animes are pure shit) depicting a Chinese army going into an alternate universe and saving people of a Tibetan-esque theocracy from its bloody thirsty ruler... Oh just imagine the uproar... but this is literally the same thing.\\n\\n\r\nAs a history major, watching this is almost unnerving. It's almost comedic watching the almost fictional Japanese invasion force taking an opponent with Roman era technology as seriously as they'd would the Russians.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard not to draw parallels between this anime and the reality of the current Japanese politics, now that the Japanese military is free to invade other countries again.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, off topic, sorry for being conscious that history does in fact, repeats. Anyway, if you have no mind for history and have a few hours to waste on a well animated Japanese right wing propaganda, you've found the right show.",

            "content": "For the most part we would like to dismiss this as another fantasy adventure based anime where people find themselves in an alternate world, where everything is like an RPG game. But unlike the usual where the main character is a young boy, here it involves an adult...........or a group of adults who were cast in this kind of anime, which is unusual since author  Takumi Yanai is targeting young adults, so it wouldn't be a surprise if this anime has violence, prostitution and vice in it so:\r\nStorywise, the theme of the anime was simply based upon the metaphor of what history education thatJapan teaches to their youngsters about Japan's involvement during world war 2. Were to them, Japan's intention was to liberate the whole Asian region of foreign domination but made no acknowledgement that they plan to only to replace it with their own domination, so frankly I really don't like how the metaphor of the anime or manga implying. Also, the plot has that geopolitical theme in it where it imply that Japan should no longer follow it's pacifistic stance and should take an active role for their military , which, by the way is something that their PM, Shinzo Abe is campaigning for. Now I don't about you, but IMO I think Japan should remain within its Pacifistic stand.\\n\\n\r\nArtwise, well we don't see a lot of fanservices around, I don't, know if them girls being in the onsen counts, but quiet frankly only the angle prostitute is the only one whom we get to see some panty service. So, when watching, don't expect any full melons in this anime, but overall the background works are very good, thought they're still the usual things one would see in any similar anime with  a fantasy and adventure genre. But what I really like was the uniforms of them JSDF, but it seems that somebody didn't tell the background designer  MacDonald Scott, that the JSDF Air Force's  McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom is colored in camouflage green and it is always manned by two person, one is the pilot and the other is a Radar Interception Officer who sits at the back.\\n\\n\r\nSoundwise, well I'd say for Risa Taneda to voice Rory Mercury was pretty amazing and also the gun shot and all that KABOOM where realistic in a sense. But it really nice that the seiyu who did Itami's voice, Swabe Junichi it relly felt natural, at least he doesn't have to pretend to be a teen . The open song fit well with the anime and so as the ending song, but I just don't like them. Also , Tomasu Haruka to play a teenage princess Pina Colada, doesn't have that young intonation anymore and should have been the one to play Aoi Risa, instead of being Pina Colada...I think I'll have another one, the drink I mean.\\n\\n\r\nOn the character, well, if we're to take notice of some of the character name, we counld surmise that it probabaly has something to do with the author, Takumi Yanai's like the Pina Colada, why he name the Italica Princess from a rum based cocktail we'd never know, but we can conclude that he or she, probably like that kind of drink  of course there is also a certain character called \"Beef eater\" now I don't know if he or she got that from those sissy royal guards from Buckingham palace or from a brand of Gin with the same name, but if she or he did, then they probably drink lots of it. Now, there is that Gothic Lolita Rory Mercury, did  Takumi Yanai got that name from Freddie Mercury??????WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS MY  FRIENDS...AND WE'LL KEEP FIGHTING TILL THE END, WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, WEEE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, NO TIME FOR LOSERS..........Oh dear sorry about the troll, well we can assume that Rory's name was based from that guy. and there is Tuka Marceau where Mr. Takumi got that character's name we also never know, but as I see it Itami was still the usual harem dude except that he's more adult like than a teenager and the harem member are just limited to Lelei, Rory and Tuka, however I don't the idea that he was made to be this lolicon, in fact most of the character here were made to focus on the lolicon theme like Sugawara and Sherry which to me is kinda disgusting for the author to do. Despite of of the flaws the characters were still able to provide some entertainment for us audience. So......\\n\\n\r\nHow entertaining is this anime from it;s 1st and 2nd sequel? It entertaining enough....to a certain point.\\n\\n\r\nBut, in its overall  I give it a \"4\" as in decent enough to watch, since I can't forgive this anime's geopolitical metaphor and the lolicon theme applied to some character.",

            "content": "Okay so I discovered the Gate series randomly and decided to give it a go. By the end of the second season and especially throughout the second season, my interest and enjoyment had grown more and more as I eagerly watched to see what would happen next.\r\nStory: \r\nWhen I started this series I immediately fell in love with the plot and the mix between 'our world' and the 'fantasy world' aspect of it.\r\nI personally haven't watched much or any anime that has had such a strong military theme, but my gosh did I enjoy it! \r\nIt ended up being a fresh storyline and plot forme to experience and enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 is more serious than the first but I think that's a good thing as they were able to focus more on character development and the main storyline. There are a few surprising scenes even though it was censored, I was surprised to see them include elements of rape, abuse, ect but they were only brief moments.\\n\r\nOverall the story kept me well engaged as I even ended up binge watching season 2 over two days. In my case the series got me rooting for Itami and the gang, as well as despising Zorzal so much that I couldnt wait to see what pain and fate awaited him. I would of liked to see more screen time for certain characters like Rory for example. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is the same as the first season. I thought the character designs were cute and fitted each personality well. The battle scenes were well done and I enjoyed watching how the military's combat plans and missions were executed. Overall the art is quite detailed and I enjoyed watching the planes and battle scenes most, although I have seen better art in other series it is still very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI thought the OP song was good maybe not something I would listen to but it was decent. I loved the OP animation more than the song to be honest.  \\n\r\nI loved the character voices, I found Rory's constant sexy voice hilarious and thought the voices overall matched each character well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, I personally feel the characters developed more during the second season. Zorzal was a successfully made villain as they got me hating his character so much. \\n\r\nIt was nice but brief the small romantic gestures/looks throughout the series that brought certain characters together. I always personally love a good romance plot/subplot but I have to admit that this series is fine as it is; focusing more on the action rather than the romance. I love the female Knights characterisation and how cute and kick ass they are. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis series may not be a masterpiece but that doesn't mean it's not worth your time. I for one am glad I found this anime and stuck with it to watch the second season! It's an interesting and fun series with a slightly dark undertone in some aspects during the second season, and very well done. I had a great time watching it and recommend it to anyone who loves or wants to try/continue watching an interesting action adventure series which brings two different worlds and ways of life together revolving around the Japanese Military. If you have already watched season one, then I highly recommend watching season two as it continues the story very well and leaves you satisfied with its progression and for the most part it's conclusion.\\n",

            "content": "The second part of GATE is much more interesting than its first season.\r\nThe story is darker and explains many things that were not even mentioned in the first season. We get to know new interesting and fresh characters, keeping the high standards of the show. The way this season brings a lot of problems to our protagonists and how they suffer to get over them is amazingly executed. I have to say I was feeling really nervous while watching most if the intense scenes this season has, which again shows us how well developed the story is.\r\nStory: 10.\r\nThe animations is still outstanding. Excellent quality ofimage and an incredible screenplay. I would say the animation is better in this season that the previous one, and that's something we don't get from any anime. Although I don't like CGI, I have to say this show has an intelligent way to use it, which is exclusively for the JSDF's vehicles and weaponry. It's the perfect contrast between modern warfar and medieval armament.\\n\r\nArt: 10.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much variaton in music in this season even though it was released one year later, which is kind of disapointing. Nevertheless, the soundtrack is still amazing and makes the action scenes more enjoyable. I still have complains with the SFX quality, but that doesn't mean it's bad. We hear new sound effects related to magic and combat situations. We can hear new voices between the JSDF troops and some other are a bit familiar.\\n\r\nSound: 9. High quality but poor variaton.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are as amazing as always. As I said before, we get to know new faces during the season, being Zorzal the most notorius of them all. Unfortunately, character development is really poor and slow most of the cases. I think the character who grew the most is Lelei La Lelena since she becomes a really important piece of the story.\\n\r\nCharacters: 9. Interesting characters but poor development in most of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are more dynamic and, in some cases, \"mature\" than in the first season. The obvious advantage of the JSDF over their enemies is taken with a well made black humour. Itami shows us his Ranger and S capabilities without forgetting his kindness. We get to see some magic duels and medieval battles too, so the pack for me is complete.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the second season of GATE is way better than its first counterpart. More enjoyable with better story and development of the trama. Please do not drop GATE in its first season or you'll be missing and incredible season two.",

            "content": "Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri 2nd Season ; or actually Gate season 1.5 (indeed, the whole show was initially composed of 24 episodes but they decided to split it into 2x12 episodes and aired them during 2 consecutive seasons) was the direct continuation of the events shown previously.\r\nBasically it starts directly at episode 13 instead of episode 1 (considering it would be a new season... which isn't the case in fact). Naturally it requires to have watched the season 1, as you can guess. \r\nGate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri comes back with the squad we discovered, starring Itami, Rory (best girl), Leleil, Yao& Tuka, going on new adventures with a political & military background as usual. This time, you won't focus on big fights opposing knights and archers versus tanks and choppers with a \"Ride of the Valkyries\" from Richard Wagner background. No indeed, season 2 puts the ton on political side, especially with the introduction on an important diplomat in charge of the negociation between Japan and Empire.\\n\\n\r\nHowever do not despair : you will watch an exciting scene of a dragon behind blew up with C4 & rocket launchers, then her 2 babies will respectively take missiles in the teeth and bombs in the nose. Season 2 was - in my opinion - more serious than its older sister. Cruelty, violence and backstab are your introduction dish, then help yourself with a full plate of cute / soft moments with Itami's squad. To be fair, these parts annoyed me sometimes because on a side they introduce a great battlefield and on the other side, they give you an irritating fight between magical sisters.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Gate season 2 (more like 1.5) was pleasant to watch but there are some negative points I should enlighten. Indeed, many characters were introduced in the season 1 and the second season brings even more... god too many so that it is impossible to remember everyone's name... Quite a waste by it surely sticks to the original plot. \\n\\n\r\nAbout a possible season 3 : the anime ended about 3 years ago from this day. Season 2 ending was torn between concluding the show forever (showing couples, our hero back to his regular life, new heir for the Empire, etc) but it also gave huge hints of a possible return. For example, we learned that the 3rd son of Emperor Molto left his native realm to make a colation of foreign countries, in order to defeat his own brother. Talking about the brother : he himself left the city with his manipulative slave Tyuule, thinking about another day of fight. These 2 brothers still alive with their titles & powers could easily lead to another conflict involving Japan. And as I quickly read : light novel or manga could cover a 12 episode season 3 and even 4 (or a single 24 episodes season 3).\\n\\n\r\nSadly, even if the manga is still ongoing, I convinced myself that there won't be anymore screen time for our favorite squad (Rory best girl). Time to read the manga ! I still recommend this anime if you appreciated season 1 because it brings a continuity and still keeps great joyful fights, mixing modernity and tradition.\\n\\n\r\nEdit : I didn't finish yet to read every chapters covering season 2 but it is still possible to make a clear statement. As I mentionned in my S1 review, both anime & manga versions were looked alike, anime was even better on some points (power of sound !) and the fact 12x24 minutes were greatly enough to cover everything and even add a few more scenes (especially Gate's first battle).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I already noticed that a lot of scenes drew in the written version were simply cut from the animated version. To spoil a bit : most cut parts are quite tiny, like discussions between some characters, taking 1-2-3 pages. Or another part I wished to watch animated : when Itama goes on the flame dragon hunt, his superiors decide to send reinforcements. The manga shows the whole deployment, including tanks moving across a river and meeting fishmen, arriving at a city where Duran gets recognized, etc. It does not change the whole plot but these scenes add a little something appreciated !\\n\\n\r\nBut where I am currently reading, there seems to be the first major event, that is (if you don't want to read it, please go to the next paragraph)...\\n\r\nLelei being sick due to some strange illness they meet in a village, after starting a ressources exploration.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, it is easy to figure out that they faced a lack of available screentime, so they managed to conclude the anime without adding another episode or OVA. But it cannot erase the fact some parts seem to be rushed. However, I can only recommend reading the manga if you appreciated Gate season 1 and / or 2. In my opinion, animated version of season 1 is really similar to its parent, while animated season 2 differs a lot from the written version (due to an obligation to cut a few parts).\\n\\n\r\n2nd edit : It eventually didn't take me long to finish reading the 82 chapters released. In fact, most of them were published after the anime finished airing (1 per month, approximately) so the story really differs from the anime. I mean, Gate's animated version managed to put an end to the plot but they also left hints for a possible third season. However, you have to know that chapter 82 (latest one) does not reach the anime's ending. So that means there is no manga material to cover up anything in anime. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, even if we won't -probably- get to watch anymore of Gate's serie on screen, the written version still brings a lot & a lot of content that wasn't in the anime. Simply because they needed to clear everything up in order to give it a proper ending. That's why I felt the second season was rushed, some parts weren't related correctly and some major ones event got cut out. If you ever felt disappointed by any episode, just go and read the manga (if I remember correctly, second season starts around 28th chapter) : you will not regret it ! Even better : the war is not over yet, our best squad hasn't arrived yet to the capital to rescue the princess, and they even face another side of the war, that was mentioned but not shown.\\n\\n\r\nI have great hopes for a decent ending in the written version.\\n",

            "content": "When it comes to tv it's a fact of life, making second seasons to already great shows are difficult. Trying to transfer that quality into a brand new sequel and season and trying to continue the series isn't that easy. This is further exemplified in the second season of Gate where I can safely say it's great. However I still felt something was just missing that was present in the first season.\r\nThe main premise of the second season of gate is quite similar to the first. It chronicles the political relationship between Japan and the world in the other side of the gate. Thisincludes talks of peace and war as well as shrewd power struggles and corruption. As this is described we also discover more about Itami and his own endeavors with the three main girls, the elf tuka,The magician leilei, and the Demi god Rory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in this second season was pretty interesting. The fire dragon arc was very entertaining and you defiantly wanted to see these characters kill this gigantic fire dragon especially when you discover more about the other characters. The politics of the empire are also well described with the addition of Zolzal and Tyuule and the political power struggle. \\n\\n\r\n However a major problem I do have with the story is that the characters don't seem to grow and learn with the exception of one character. In the first season it seems that they're constantly learning about the new world they live in and it doesn't seem like that in the second season. And it also seems at points that they are telling two different stories and that Itami is just isolated from the political struggle. However gate had a good ending even though there is room for more story to be created.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of gate are still as entertaining as ever despite my above complaint. There are also some great new characters that were added new to this season. This includes the dark elf Yao and the crown prince Zolzal. Zolzal was an awesome villain because of the elaboration of his schemes and his cunning. However a problem is that some characters fail to acquire further development in this season except for Tuka. Tuka's mental condition was well explained and she had an amazing relationship with Itami. Itami was still a great character and very entertaining. I did have a problem with the fact that he was slightly disconnected from his theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the second season was quite good. While the OST wasn't as memorable the opening theme and ending theme were both excellent and they definitely stood up to the first season. The animation gate was stunning no doubt. The colors were beautiful and the flow of the animation was very good. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion the second season of gate was indeed very great. It managed to tell a compelling story. However there were some significant incongruencies. Despite that both seasons of gate are definitely worth watching and the seamless blend of genres with some very entertaining characters definitely is the recipe for a very great and fun series.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nGate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri 2nd Season, much like its predecessor, makes me think about the advancement of technology. Last time, it was weapons. This time, it is transportation.\r\nWe started with running on the ground. Then we tamed horses. Then we drove cars. Then we took subways. And then we piloted helicopters. We, as a people, have made advancements in movement at a rate that we (figuratively and ironically) cannot keep up with.\r\nThe citizens of the Empire within Gate (reducing the title at this point) are still stuck with just horses. And, sadly, theyare still stuck with a mediocre anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nGate returns for the continuation to its split-cour season. Tuka Luna, Rory, Lelei, and of course Youji also return to take care of the problems facing the Japanese army and the mighty Empire.\\n\\n\r\nThis time around, Gate still takes advantage of its premise \u2013 namely, the overwhelming might of the Japanese army against a kingdom who still dwells within the realm of swords and castles. Delegates witnessing a contained demonstration of mortar shells, jets bombing strategic buildings, and paratroopers raining from the skies make the distinction between these two sides clearer.\\n\\n\r\nThis season even manages to down the patriotic platform that the first season felt dripped in. This new direction occurs because the anime focuses more on the mythical rather than the military, but it removed that saturated feeling of a pushed ideology.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the anime has to worry less about establishing a setting and its characters and instead can focus on its narrative. To this end, the anime comes up with many different plotlines all tied together by a singular, overarching one. Namely, Tyuule\u2019s destruction (from the inside) of the Empire.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the various, smaller plotlines. To be fair to Gate, it creates a lot of conflict that does not tread into repetitive territory. That is, for the most part, much of what happens remains relevant while also differentiating itself enough to be interesting. The start of the season has more slice-of-life material with Tuka\u2019s strange delirium. Afterwards, the anime becomes darker as Youji and the gang square off against a fire-breathing dragon.\\n\\n\r\nThen Lelei\u2019s aside at the magical city contrasts with the upheaval happening back in the capital. All the while, a plot of assassination, a peace-brokering dilemma, and a mysterious enemy stir up the narrative that much more. Everything ends with a final, Japanese-military mission to thwart the evil in place and bring happiness to both sides of the Gate.\\n\\n\r\nAs can be read, a lot goes on over the course of just twelve episodes. So Gate gets a few more props. Now, whether or not it executed these various plotlines, juggled them all together in an appropriate manner, is another matter entirely.\\n\\n\r\nFor some of the conflicts, they do bring tension. The assassination attempt by Delilah, Sugawara breaking neutrality by helping Sherry, and the imprisonment of Pi\u00f1a by Zorzal. These conflicts keep with the plot\u2019s motif (fantasy versus military) as well as allow the plot to proceed naturally from one major conflict to the next.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, Gate has quite a few plotlines that are downright mishandled. One of the strangest plotlines occurs with Lelei\u2019s summons to Rondel for her \u201cacademic presentation\u201d as Youji puts it. As a whole, two separate problems exist.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the plotline means nothing to the larger narrative. They could have gone anywhere else, done anything else, and the outcome would have been the same. And second, the \u201cPied Piper\u201d subplot. He (or she for all we know) is that \u201cmysterious enemy\u201d mentioned earlier. But the anime never reveals the identity of she (or he) let alone resolves his (or her) plotline.\\n\\n\r\nThe dragon battle is not without its own problems, too. To be fair, the battle itself is fairly engaging, taking advantage of the show\u2019s premise once more with magical swords and landmine explosions. Altogether, a pretty cool battle.\\n\\n\r\nThis conflict faults elsewhere. Besides the fact that the anime provides a minimal (minimal) amount of information on the dark elves, the anime attempts to squeeze in an extra conflict. A couple of baby dragons, led by an Apostle similar to Rory, make trouble. They exist as means to show off the Japanese military a bit \u2013 fighter jets and tanks engage in one-sided combat. Which is acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nBut that Apostle, who indirectly decimated Yao\u2019s and Tuka Luna\u2019s clans as well as many others, and who showed up to begin with to take Rory back to Hardy (their leader), runs away. Worse still, Gate does not revisit this conflict in earnest for the remainder of the season, making one wonder what the point was of introducing it to begin with. This small conflict was nothing short of tacked on.\\n\\n\r\nThe most egregious issue, however, happens near the end. Youji and his team (that includes his newfound friends as well as his soldiers) infiltrate the castle, defeat a giant, and save both the Emperor and Pi\u00f1a. They won. But instead of taking out Zorzal. Instead of beating him up to a bloody pulp (again) to put him in his place. Instead of even just taking him prisoner for the numerous atrocities he\u2019s committed and the moronic actions he\u2019s taken. They let him go free.\\n\\n\r\nThe argument is that Youji and the Japanese army will always know where he is and how to find him. But when such a dangerous (and dense) dude has shown to be such an abysmal person, not taking any actions against him \u2013 when any military in their right mind would (and they themselves have touted their prowess) \u2013 is nothing short of silly.\\n\\n\r\nAs if that weren\u2019t silly enough, his last line about getting revenge against Youji and the Japanese indicates that this convenient turn of events exists solely to have him cause unnecessary mayhem at some point in the future. Altogether, this admittedly minor event is absolutely asinine.\\n\\n\r\nEven the themes encounter trouble. Themes on war, like the media\u2019s inaccurate portrayal or the aftereffects of being a prisoner, are briefly shown or talked about. Unfortunately, they are never made into strong talking points. Still, the anime never intended to investigate these ideas in full; after all, its focus was more on the mixture of mythical and militaristic elements.\\n\\n\r\nAlongside the surprising lack of world-building, Gate\u2019s narrative\u2019s negatives outweigh its positives, making it a weak tale in summation.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation for Gate remains relatively the same from last season.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the military tech \u2013 tanks, fighter jets, etc. \u2013 as well as the giant dragon use CG art that passes an acceptable level. Some CG segments, such as a wave of armor-clad guards, does not pass, but those scenes are not as common.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the anime\u2019s signature paneled view, where multiple rectangular sections showcase characters or scenes happening simultaneously, returns. And, once again, it adds a bit of variety to the festivities at hand. What does not return is the Japanese side of the Gate. Losing out on the dichotomous aesthetics seems like a mistake, but, since the anime had all of its business on the Empire\u2019s side, this loss is forgiven.\\n\\n\r\nLocations visited include the makeshift town, the capital\u2019s different sectors, and the mountainous region where the dragon lays. Not too much variety and not too much detail makes the art less impressive than it otherwise is.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, the character designs and the animation are exempt from this treatment. The cast keep their same colorful, detailed looks from the first season. Tuka\u2019s long blonde hair with modernized (for Earth) white t-shirt and tight jeans. Rory\u2019s fancy dress, bow, and gargantuan axe. Lelei\u2019s all-blue attire. Newer characters, like Zorzal\u2019s regal outfit and Tyuule\u2019s original unkempt and later kempt looks, keep with the norm. The other citizens of the Empire all vary in size, shape, and appearance, adding even more variety to the designs.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while Youji and the Japanese are decidedly plain in their looks, their plainness continues to contrast them with the fantastical land \u2013 an important motif throughout the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation likewise sees highs. While the anime does not define itself through animation, certain segments \u2013 such as the dragon battle, the first skirmish in the castle\u2019s main hall, and the final battle against the giant \u2013 include a lot of magic, acrobatics, and explosions to make those fights that much more intense. To be fair, fights of this magnitude are not always happening, but downtime also includes lots of hair, eye, and limb movements from the characters to get even the \u201cslower\u201d segments moving.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe only truly influential newcomer is Tyuule.\\n\\n\r\nRight from the get-go, her character is a tragic one as she finds herself at the hands of her captor Zorzal. But as the audience soon learns, she is not just a tragic character but also a dark character. A dark character with more than sinister intentions.\\n\\n\r\nHer captivity and darkness stem from a past event involving her and her people. Unfortunately, the anime quickly passes over her backstory with just a couple of frames worth of flashback. The audience loses out on who she was as a person before, and, as such, the show fails to put her plight into perspective.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, she follows through on her ultimate revenge: destroying the Empire. She pretends to be enamored with Zorzal, eventually becoming his main advisor. She feeds false information to cause chaos. She poisons the king to place his beyond-incompetent son into power to spark civil turmoil. While she does not normally directly take part in the craziness, she stirs the pot to a boiling point all the same.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, she says that she destroyed the Empire, but that\u2019s not really the case. The Japanese army didn\u2019t needlessly kill civilians (going so far as to save important peace delegates). Plus, not only do they save the king, but also Pi\u00f1a. She is the main advocate on the Empire\u2019s side vying for peace between them and the Japanese, and she becomes queen of the land, ushering in a new age of prosperity.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason for Tyuule\u2019s failed revenge is seen in the tears that fall from her face. What she wanted wasn\u2019t revenge \u2013 she wanted her life back. The people she befriended, the land she held, and the happiness she had. All of which revenge could not bring her. In other words, her character represents the idea that seeking revenge is a futile venture.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the idea is nice, but the execution is not.\\n\\n\r\nTuka Luna also goes through a degree of tragedy herself but nowhere near the same level as Tyuule. In the beginning of the season, Yao confronts Tuka, making her think about the loss of her own clan and, more specifically, the loss of her father. Unfortunately, while there are parallels between Tuka and Yao \u2013 both are of elfish descent, both lost their clan, etc. \u2013 the anime does not explore these throughputs.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, Tuka goes practically insane. So insane, in fact, that she moves beyond pretending that her father is not dead and wandering the city in search of him. Instead, she begins to believe that Youji is her father. He goes along with the charade for a time, demonstrating that kindness can sometimes only be a Band-Aid rather than a remedy.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, though, Youji decides to find that cure. Knowing that Tuka needs to overcome her warped perception, he and the girls finally do what the Japanese army won\u2019t: take the fight to the dragon. While many perish, Youji and, more importantly, Tuka succeed in taking down the beast, freeing Tuka of the madness that clouded her mind for much too long.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, Tuka still calling Youji \u201cDad\u201d does not really seem as though she has gotten better, but it is still nice to know that she has accepted her reality for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast lack much in terms of character depth. Zorzal is meant to be an arrogant, ignorant, and vile person. His personality makes him easy to hate but leaves little room for complexity. Yao Ha Ducy has an interesting development when she continues her do-whatever-she-must attitude by hurting (and thereby helping) Tuka. But the anime quickly forgets about Yao following the first half of this season.\\n\\n\r\nYouji does little else besides be the everyman. The anime tries to give him some backstory, as well as parallelism with Tuka, in the form of a deranged mother, but it is hastily handed to the audience. Rory, once again, does not amount to much as a character because the anime does not give her any proper screen time and hence any proper developments. As for Lelei, she rarely has impact and intrigue except during a few of the battles.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, these three are not without their positives. Youji\u2019s ability to do everything contrasts with his inherent, just-want-to-relax self, adding comedy to his character. Rory gives the group utmost safety. And the anime juxtaposes Lelei with both her older sister and the magical town, making her level of intelligence more apparent.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the most interesting trait of the characters is the group dynamic. The group itself is actually pretty weak \u2013 they do not interact with one another all that much. But their individual relationships with Youji make their whole group quirky. At least, quirkier than it already is.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the harem members looks to Youji as her dad. One of them acts as his guardian. One of them thinks of him as a mentor. One of them believes him to be the kingdom\u2019s savior. And one of them is literally a technical possession of his. They all show signs of romance, but it\u2019s their strange relationships to Youji that make their group, well, quirky.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track for Gate brings the rock. While the quick guitar solo comes out of nowhere at the end, the guitar riffs, nice vocal work, and pounding drums work together to make a tough and cool track that fits the anime well.\\n\\n\r\nIn heavy contrast, to both the OP and the anime as a whole, the ending track takes on quite the lighthearted tone. Tuka, Rory, and Lelei take turns singing to the slow, happy beat, making for a calm send-off to each high-stakes episode. The ED is even pretty catchy. Arguably, it contrasts a bit too much with action-heavy show, but it\u2019s still a nice piece all around.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, given that this season is the continuation of a split-cour, Gate using much of the same original soundtrack is no surprise. Lots of military-esque tracks with trumpets and leveled tunes. Violin-heavy tracks that set the mood for the battles to come. And relaxing-fantasy ones for those slice-of-life segments. Once again, the OST fits but does not leave a lasting impression.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting likewise sees similar performances as last season. Ami Koshimizu as Tyuule goes cruel. Risa Taneda as Rory combines craziness and sexiness. And Hisako Kanemoto as Tuka Luna continues her mature yet cute voice for all to hear. In short, everyone involved does an above-average job.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve talked about this before, but one of the major reasons why an anime like this pulls me along is for me wanting, nay needing, to ensure that the safety of the characters holds up. Or, at the minimum, that the characters \u201cwin\u201d in the end.\\n\\n\r\nSo it came as no surprise to me that Tyuule\u2019s safety, considering her deplorable situation, had me wanting to see more of the season. Again, not because of the dragon or the military, but because I needed to know that she would be safe once all was animated and done.\\n\\n\r\nI somewhat got my wish in that she ruined Zorzal\u2019s life to an extent. But I was disappointed that she still seemed to be following him. In essence, I wanted to see her do more. Run away, destroy him. Anything to make me feel as though she were heading towards a bright future. Sadly, that didn\u2019t happen.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character in the anime is actually Yao Ha Ducy, but, once the dragon arc ended, she became an almost permanent side character as events unfolded that did not directly concern her. Tuka Luna is next on my list of favorites, but the whole \u201cdad\u201d direction she took knocked down her appeal a few pegs.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters I did not much care for. Rory is a bit annoying, Lelei doesn\u2019t have much presence. As for Youji, he was not funny and was not relatable, so he, too, failed to be an entertaining character.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, my favorite part was the end. Not Pi\u00f1a\u2019s crowning or Youji getting screwed out of taking part in his hobby once more. It was the quick showcasing of the different pairings that had been made over the course of the season.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the pairing between Sherry and Sugawara is weird due to their ages, it was still nice to see the show acknowledge these different relationships and where they were at or where they were going. Extra kudos to the pairing between Delilah and Akira, the assassin and the assassee (I just made that word up; I\u2019m not sure why it isn\u2019t a word considering the word \u201cassassin\u201d itself), for sharing an unexpected yet welcomed romance.\\n\\n\r\nGate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri 2nd Season encounters both highs and lows. Some tense moments in the story riddled with silly conclusions. A quirky group lacking individual development. And some nice artistic and musical pieces brought down by unsatisfying characters. It looks like, for the time being, this one will have to continue being content with its horses.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, while the premise still holds, the patriotism has been toned down, and some of the conflicts bring tension, many plotlines are handled poorly, the final conflict is asinine, and the unexplored themes only get in the way\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, okay artistic direction, nice character designs, above-average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Tyuule and Tuka Luna are okay, as are the quirky connections of the main group, but Youji, Rory, and Lelei still have issues being worthwhile characters\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, good ED, okay OST, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, unfortunate outcomes and some boring characters, but at least some romance was had\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "I'm a little too busy following the presidential campaign and Tokyo earthquakes and my own career to pay attention to Japan's military situation, but from what I can gather, they're starting to recover from choosing the wrong side in WWII and they have a bit of a hissy fit when China enters their eye. So I couldn't really tell you how accurate Gate is in representing their defense forces or if it's all that successful at recruiting otaku to join the JSDF, but speaking as someone who refuses to join the military on account of how I wouldn't survive ten seconds in a Full MetalJacket camp, I can safely say that if the show had been about Americans overpowering Middle-Earth with nukes, I'd think \"how fucking stupid do you think I am?\". It's the fact that I never feel the soldiers are in any danger that's always gotten to me about Gate. There's nothing fun about conflicts when either side has an advantage over each other so large it makes the San Andreas fault look like a housefly. I make fun of Harry Potter for never introducing guns in the war against Voldemort, but let's be honest with ourselves. It wouldn't have made good fiction, and it would have made things a lot more tediously complicated.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, is there really no person equivalent to Rory's fighting abilities and status on the fantasy people's side? If a foreign country can recruit a demon without too much trouble, I'm sure the homeland country can interest her sister with something.\\n\\n\r\nSo Gate 2 pretty much picks off where Gate 1 left off, except not really because I remember the first half ending with the characters agreeing to fight some dragons and that doesn't happen until a few episodes into this cour. There's not really much in here that's changed between halves either. It's still a bunch of military propaganda saying \"join us now. We have cute girls and we are the most powerful force in the world, so you don't have to worry about getting killed and you can do your otaku hobbies during break\". The fantasy people are pretty much just a bunch of idiots who couldn't put up a good fight against a machine gun to save their lives. And the production is still fine, although I'm getting annoyed at how all A-1 Pictures' character designs have the same flatness to their style like they hired the Sword Art Online character designer for every single thing they work on.\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn't really do a whole lot to ramp things up in this cour either. As expected from light novel land, the plot is pretty much just a bunch of interchangeable conflicts that are supposed to give off a sense of progression, but I call it a desperate attempt to cover up the fact that you're not going to change the status quo. Occasionally, one of the three female fantasy characters on Itami's side will face a personal conflict, but it's always for the character's sake and never for the story's. I don't really understand how the elf girl's amnesia plotline really added to anything, nor do I understand what Rory contributes being an overpowered being on a side that's already overpowered. In fact, I don't think Itami goes through any sort of character arc either in this show, despite being the main character. The story ends with him resuming his daily life, only to get annoyed when the fantasy girls tag along, which is an ending that would get laughed at if any military movie in the States pulled that shit.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, whilst I've sort of accepted Gate's stupidity by the time I got to watching the series, it still fails without the nationalism angle because it's just boring and uncreative with the conflicts in general. As I said before regarding Marvel stuff, as well as critically acclaimed action films like Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and The Nice Guys to a lesser extent, I don't like conflicts where the villains the good guys have to face are something I could have scraped off a first draft for a Silver Age comic book or a Ubisoft game. Not a single person that Itami's crew has to face are the least bit memorable, and they're so ill-equipped to fight them anyways that it doesn't really make much of a difference. Plus, when you're basically making dragons extinct with fighter jets, there's really not a whole lot you can do to raise the stakes any higher.\\n\\n\r\nThis is particularly true during the final fight, where I don't think the opposing side put a scratch on any of our heroes. Itami and his mini-harem pretty much slaughter the giants, walk out with the princess, and then the show just ends with what I assume is the main villain swearing revenge. I know the novel series is still going, but I wouldn't have known that if I didn't look it up, because that finale sure seemed to assume that there was nothing left to say. And before you ask, no I don't remember who the main villain was and I don't care to look him up. I can't even remember if he was the guy who was raping princesses with bunny ears or not. That's how little an impact that guy had.\\n\\n\r\nI guess Gate will be your thing if you like the idea of meshing fantasy and military together in the same way that most people like Space Jam because they like the idea of NBA Basketball and the Looney Tunes coexisting with each other, in which case fuck you guys because that movie was terrible and I have no idea why we're getting a sequel or roping the director of the good Fast & Furious movies into the thing. Also, given how much Rory fan art I see out there - a good chunk from people who haven't seen the show no less - I think it's pretty clear who's the heart of this thing. But in all seriousness, the idea does have potential for exploring the dangers of technological gaps in the same vein that the Tales of Symphonia sequel attempted to do between its wildly different lands, and if Gate had focused on that, I might have been interested. Hell, if there was a scene where one of these cat-eared girls discovers the existence of a flamethrower and tests it out, that would have been cute enough. Instead, we just get military propaganda within the realm of a fantasy setting, and neither side really does much to stand out from the rest of the pack by themselves, let alone with each other.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering I don't like fantasy stories or military stuff, I'm not even sure why I'm still dwelling on Gate. Might as well just wrap things up and go watch something on Netflix. I heard Lady Dynamite is pretty decent, although these post-modern comedies are getting kinda same-y to me.",

            "content": "In my review of season 1, I suggested saluting the Japanese flag. Well, it looks like the writers decided to give me a hand because the ending now contains a Japanese flag flying gloriously. Plus fantasy girls in military gear in various military activities, having tons of fun. In fact, the military is portrayed as so fun we should all join. Play around in the bath and get the complimentary harem. Sounds legit to me.\r\n...Anyway, season 2 picks up where the last one left off. Beyond the titular gate is a fantasy land with elves, dragons, catgirls and whatnot. The place has been annexed byJapan and with much creativity and sensitivity named the Special Region. Now the virtuous Japanese Self-Defence Force (SDF) proceeds to help the local population against tyranny and oppression. And they carry it out honorably despite being hindered by incompetent politicians, propaganda-spewing journalists, and other countries such as the US who like to mess with Japan's business.\\n\\n\r\nWhat? The Japanese constitution forbids using the SDF abroad? Don't be silly. If you annex the place, it counts as part of Japan, duh. Or maybe since the gate is inside Japan, they decided all its contents are too. If they have a team of lawyers, I'd like to hire them too.\\n\\n\r\nPlus they loot, err I mean procure, whatever natural resources there are in the area. That's right; Japan strikes oil. Get rekt, Middle East. The local lords had no idea oil is even valuable when they signed the mining deal. Suckers.\\n\\n\r\nAs you might expect, the SDF wrecks the natives with ease. Again. Which is not really surprising because the local royalty and feudal lords have not learned much in the ways of warfare or diplomacy. Actually, forget the guns; they can't even match the SDF in a fistfight. And when the SDF isn't overpowered enough, the otaku protagonist's harem of mages and demigod lolis swoops in and wins in a few seconds. There is also a CGI dragon that is thankfully at least a bit more challenging, and that is probably the reason why it exists in the plot to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the best cure for psychological trauma is apparently revenge, best achieved by having a traumatized person operate a bazooka. What could possibly go wrong?\\n\\n\r\nThe timing of the comedy and drama is brilliant, with random fanservice right next to slavery and war crimes (not committed by the SDF, don't worry). Just the way I like it. Romance is also handled with subtlety: near the end we even get a montage of all the latest crack pairings.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you are looking for lots of fanservice, explosions and nationalistic right-wing sentiment, this is the anime for you. Season 3 hype?",

            "content": "Every so and often, we come across a series where there\u2019s some controversy. Anime isn\u2019t shy to take risks and so we have stories that involves the military, politics, prostitution, and slavery. Putting that aside, a show is also capable of capitalizing on these risks and turn it into something of a blessing in disguise. Gate Jieitai Kanochi nite Kaku Tatakaeri 2nd Season is one of these shows.\r\nReturning for a second season, GATE focuses on two major arcs. A few things first though. The series has already build a lot with the first season as we were introduced to Itami Youji, a lieutenant from theGround Self-Defense Force. Also known for his otaku characteristics, Itami\u2019s encounter on the other side of the world (beyond the GATE as I\u2019d like to call it) leads to extraordinary discoveries. Elves, mages, dragons, and even demi-gods. These are just a few of the otherworldly that Itami encounters. Of course, between the two worlds, there\u2019s also a lot of conflict.\\n\\n\r\nThe conflict continues into GATE Season 2. The first few episodes also sets up for quite a bit of events for the reminder course of the story. Characters such as Zorzal El Caesar (first prince of the Empire) and Tyuule (ruler of the warrior bunnies) are just a few that causes controversy. The emperor of the Empire also seems to be planning for big things while Pina still tries to maintain a state of peace between the two worlds. Then, there\u2019s also characters like Sherry Tyueli, a young girl who has a surprisingly crafty mind. GATE Season 2 introduces a variety of characters to instill the purpose of role diversity. It also goes to show that characters of any age, gender, or race can potentially influence a great deal in the story.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Itami is still the main guy along with the three girls that we fondly adores from the first season. Furthermore, Itami\u2019s relationship in particular with Tuka seems to have grown much deeper in one of the later episodes. Lelei development as a mage is also evident as we witness her skills against even an almighty dragon during the Red Dragon Arc. And who can forget about Rory? The ever so cunning demi-god also develops a special connection with Itami as she gets involved with an old rival. In essence, every main girl shines in their way while Itami still plays the role of being the leader of the squad. In the meantime, there\u2019s a lot of political tension building up that really makes the second season darker than it seems.\\n\\n\r\nThese include attempted assassinations, human slavery, and a plot to overthrow the empire within its own forces. If you remember Pina, she also becomes entrenched with controversial affairs that takes unexpected dark turns. It goes to say that GATE still maintains what it tries to do \u2013 developing story episode by episode while feeding a lot of its ideas towards a climax. It works out quite well once we realize the purpose of its intent. And while it\u2019s at it, GATE isn\u2019t afraid to show death and make it into a reality. War exists \u2013 both in the fantasy and real world with GATE still developing on that throughout the season. Also, don\u2019t forget that the show has a lot of military themes and we can easily see how Japan adapts its propaganda fueled by its technological arsenal. Also, it\u2019s noticeable that GATE continuously maintain a high level of world building. It\u2019s easily recognized and has always been one of the show\u2019s stronger points. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike the first season, the sequel has less comedy and much more on plot emphasis. By the third or fourth episode, I think it\u2019s easy to adapt with the style as the show has already introduced enough concepts. But like most adaptations, the show does omit some material although nothing too crucial. Some of the more controversial content like sexual slavery and abuse is subtly hinted at while there\u2019s less gore. In addition, pacing becomes somewhat rushed in a few episodes. With the story that introduces new characters, it\u2019s not always easy to like them. Zorzal is likely to become one of the most hated characters for his cruel actions. In addition, some of the content such as sex may be uncomfortable to sink into your mind. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style of GATE generally remains the same. As I mentioned before, the world building is one of the strongest aspects of the show and we get a good amount of quality of the fantasy world. From powerful looking dragons to artistically decorated structures, the show knows where to go for when it comes to fantasy content. This also extends to character designs that really shows their distinctive appearances. From bunny warriors to apostles, you can expect a lot of unique ways the show does to make characters look different. Similar to the first season, there\u2019s also some realistic content like with Japan\u2019s military. From impressive fighter jets to heavy duty mortars, the show demonstrates what military is really capable of. Supplementing its impressive technical features, the soundtrack of season 2 retains its style that fans are used to. The OP song has a familiar tune while the majority of the action choreography is nicely performed with its stellar OST. Character voice mannerism is also noticeable with Zorzal\u2019s egoistic nature, Tyueli\u2019s manipulative personality, or Noriko\u2019s innocence.  \\n\\n\r\nWell, I can\u2019t say that season 2 of GATE is miles better than what the first season offered. However, what it does have is concrete storytelling that builds more and more. It makes viewers anticipate what\u2019s to happen next while skillfully adapt with some of its controversial content. I am a bit disappointed that it does omit certain content though. (read the LN and manga for more details) And to add on to the fire, GATE still has characters that can make people pull their hairs out. That aside, GATE Season 2 maintains a nice balance of storytelling and characters. With less comedy and more serious business picking up, it\u2019s a show that just keeps on giving.\\n\\n",

There's more JSDF propaganda in this season than the previous season. That doesn't make me love this show less, however. Also, when I say JSDF propaganda, I didn't mean that in a bad way. It's Japan's show so they can do whatever the hell they want. Hypocrites who criticizes this show for the amount of JSDF propaganda makes me sick because they're the same people who watches American films that also contains some (sometimes a lot of) U.S Army Propaganda. \r\n(There will be some SPOILERS in myreview)\\n\\n\r\n[Story]: (8/10)\\n\r\nI'm a big fan of the first season of GATE and I absolutely loved the show. When they decided to split the show into 2 cour, I was patiently waiting (and dying) for the Second Season every single day for 2-3 months before it aired. I was like one of those fanboys screaming like a girl...I was just so excited. Now that the series has finished airing, is it better than the first season and was my waiting justified? You'll find out soon enough. \\n\\n\r\nThe 2nd Season of GATE continues from where the 1st Season left off and is picked up from there. The show is separated into two arcs and adapts the \"Fire Dragon\" arc and the \"Douran\" arc. Let's focus on the most anticipated \"Fire Dragon\" arc. \\n\\n\r\nI was really hyped for this arc when I found out that they weren't going to continue it in the first season. Mostly because I wanted to see Itami, his hare -- *ahem* I mean, the girls that he rescued and his platoon fight off the Fire Dragon. However, the 2nd Season didn't really start off with the \"Fire Dragon\" arc just yet. It starts off with the Japanese Senators and the JSDF holding a peace talks with the Empire. They also began to maintain peace towards the civilians and their first step to try and improve the lives of the civilians is by setting up a Healthcare System. Now this is where the actual arc begins. \\n\\n\r\nAhh, the \"Fire Dragon\" arc..So what did I think about this arc? For the most part, it was good but not great. In the first season, Tuka's father died and we all knew that except her. When a certain someone decided to open Tuka's eyes and forced her to face the reality, she entered into a horrible state of PTSD. That's actually the first time this show made me feel sympathetic for someone else. Itami then decided to do the unthinkable so she doesn't have to face the reality which is a horrible way to deal with someone's PTSD. I gotta give props to Itami though for being a badass but people needs to face the reality sooner or later so Yao kind of did the right thing. Here's the part that I don't like. I didn't really like the way they handled Itami's past to try and relate to Tuka losing her father. Appearantly, something similar happened to Itami's parents and that's the whole reason why Itami helped Tuka kill the Fire Dragon. It was done really poorly and it's like they pulled that backstory out of their ass. That backstory wasn't explored properly, it wasn't expanded and they only spent a short amount of time which makes his backstory seems like an asspull. The arc got a nice payoff though which makes me want to forgive some of the arc's flaws. It's what I always wanted to see and I got it. The JASDF (Japanese Air Self Defence Force) raining down democracy and freedom and the JGSDF (Japanese Ground Self Defence Force) goes there to show us what happens if you mess with the JSDF.  \\n\\n\r\nThe next arc is the \"Douran\" arc. I was actually surprised that they adapted this arc. I mean, when they advertised the second season, they only showed the Fire Dragon arc on the trailers so I thought that arc would have lasted for like the whole season. Anyways, this arc focuses on two events. The first event is Itami accompanying Lelei to a town that looks so futuristic but it's not. To be more specific, it's an Academy City that trains mages. The second event is a coup inside the Empire in an attempt to destroy the peace between the Empire and Japan. Honestly, this arc is slightly better than the first arc because a lot more things happened here than the Fire Dragon arc and also a lot of politics are involved in this arc and how it plays a huge role. For example, we get to see why the JSDF wasn't deployed earlier to save the Japanese Senators and why they didn't liberate the Empire sooner.\\n\\n\r\nI talked about the pacing issues in my first season's review and I want to talk about the pacing issues in this review again. Just like the first season, the first arc was rushed and the 2nd half was still somewhat rushed but not too much. They shouldn't have rushed the 1st half because that's the whole reason why I didn't like the Fire Dragon arc that much even though we got a nice payoff at the end of the arc. Instead of rushing the arc, they should have spend more time on Tuka's PTSD and Itami's backstory which would have made a huge impact at the end if those 2 things were expanded. I have no issues with the 2nd half's somewhat rushed pacing because it's mostly politics and Itami's journey to a mage town and what he and the girls did in that town. \\n\\n\r\nI'm sure you noticed this when you watched the first episode but Gate Season 2's atmosphere sure is a lot darker than the previous season. I actually never expected Gate to touch on subjects like Rape, Abuse, and etc. They're obviously censored but they're still somewhat disturbing as shit. \\n\\n\r\nNow I want to talk about a couple of issues that I have with the 2nd Season of Gate. First is pacing issues and I already talked about it so I'll skip to the second issue. The second issue is the side characters not getting enough screentime and by side characters, I mean the soldiers in Itami's platoon not getting enough screentime at all. I really liked their character interactions and their interesting personalities in the first season but in this season, most of their screentime was taken away by Itami's harem... The final issue that I have is the ending. It was cheesy as hell and it made it look like an ad saying \"Join the JSDF and you'll get a waifu for your war efforts\". I have no problem with JSDF Propaganda but that scene was really cringy as fuck.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe 2nd Season\u2019s art and visuals looks exactly the same as the first season and no surprise there as the show was originally intended to be 24 episodes. So because of that, my ratings for this section will stay the same. There is something weird with how the background was coloured. Remember when you used to colour those colouring books and no matter how hard you colour, there will always be a few white small dots left? That\u2019s what the background looked like which made it seem like A-1 Pictures\u2019 budget was running dry or they ran out of time. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nJust like the Animation, every soundtrack were re-used from the first season. Although, I don\u2019t have any complaints with the soundtrack since they weren\u2019t bad to begin with. In fact, I preferred they kept the soundtrack because they\u2019re goddamn amazing and it gives me goosebumps all the time. Especially that soundtrack that plays when the JSDF shows up and gives those Empire bastards and the Fire Dragons a sweet taste of democracy and freedom that we all take for granted. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \u201cGATE II: Sekai wo Koete \u201c by the Akeboshi Rockets. Ok, I gotta give the Akeboshi Rockets a props for changing how their latest song plays and sounds. There\u2019s still the usual drumbeats at the beginning but at least it doesn\u2019t sound the same as HOTD\u2019s first 5 sec of the OP. Overall, the song was nice but I have a problem with the OP Animation. 90% of the scenes are re-used scenes from the first season, 5% are ripped off from their another show\u2019s OP 1 \u201cThe Asterisk War\u201d, and the last 5% are a bunch of character\u2019s face shots. Talk about being lazy or running out of ideas. \\n\r\nThe ED theme song is \u201cItsu Datte Communication\u201d by Lelei, Tuka and Rory. I really love Gate's 2nd ED theme song. It sounds so much better than that funky 1st ED theme song. It's not like I hated the 1st ED theme song. In fact, I loved it, I just prefer the 2nd ED. I love it when Lelei, Tuka, and Rory are singing together which was the reason why I loved the 1st ED of Gate. Same case here..The song is relaxing and it just sounds so beautiful. Hell, I wouldn't mind if they form an idol group. Now, in terms of the ED Animation. Hands down, their best ED Animation yet. In the 1st ED, it's just a simple Humvee riding in a tunnel with glowing lights. In here, the ED Animation is also simple but it's hilarious at the same time. Call it a propaganda shots or whatever the hell you want but I really don't give a shit what you think. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (8/10)\\n\r\nIn the previous season, a new character was introduced almost at the end of the first season. All we knew about her is she ventured out to search for the \"Green People\" or in other words, the JSDF to ask for the help in killing the Fire Dragon. In here, we get to know more about her personality during the Fire Dragon arc like how she's an asshole and does not have sympathy towards another person's feeling. It seems like she does but the way she's handling it makes her look like a bitchy, selfish, insensitive person by telling Tuka the whole truth about the fate of his father. This, however, makes Itami look like a badass by pretending to be Tuka's father. Even though he will \"put his hobby over work any day\", he did his duty as a JSDF soldier to help out Tuka. Itami felt empathy towards Tuka because he knows what it feels like to lose a parent. Like I said above though, Itami's backstory about his parents seems like an asspull and for that reason, Itami's empathy towards Tuka did not leave that much of an impact to me....It did leave a little bit of an impact to me though. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Tuka got much of a spotlight in the Fire Dragon arc to give development to her character, the show also focused on Lelei during the \"Douran\" arc. We learned that Lelei has a sister who fails at everything than her sister in every conceivable way. Though, I understand now why Lelei's teacher (in S1, Ep. 3) would rather \"mount a curvy woman like her\". She has the hots but she's one of those typical dumb blondes expect she's not dumb. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8/10)\\n\r\nI still enjoyed the 2nd Season of Gate but I didn't enjoy it as much as the first season of Gate. Just like the previous season though, I did enjoy the military aspect of the show because military in animes are portrayed as an incompetent unit who can't stand for themselves whereas in Gate, it's vice versa. I'm also a big military enthusiast so that part of me contributed to my enjoyment for this show. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Gate: And So the Special Defence Force Fought There - Season 2\" is a good sequel that finally concludes the story of Gate. I am aware that the Light Novel still has some stories to be told like \"The Civil War\" arc but I'm satisfied with how the anime version ended. I'm also happy that they finally explained how the \"Gate\" works which I thought would never happen. If you watched the 1st Season of Gate and you enjoyed it then this season is a must watch. Don't expect it to be better than the first season though. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.4/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Show's atmosphere is darker than the previous season\\n\r\n+Well-Done Story\\n\r\n+Great Animation\\n\r\n+A-1 Pictures kept the amazing soundtrack\\n\r\n+Tuka and Lelei's character development\\n\r\n+Just like the last season, portrayal of JSDF and their weaponry/military vehicles are almost realistic.\\n\r\n+They finally explained how the \"Gate\" works\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Pacing issues\\n\r\n-Itami's backstory seems like an asspull\\n\r\n-Itami's platoon did not get enough screentime",

            "content": "Dude. This anime is such garbage, oh my god.  \r\nSo, at first, I didn't realize that this was psychotically upbeat right-wing fascist, nationalist, militaristic propaganda set as a harem comedy rife with the slaughter of hundreds (if not thousands). Unfortunately, it also kind of got me hooked. \r\nI got pretty into season one, laughing hysterically about the insane murder sprees that this \"JSDF\" (apparently what the Japanese Military is called?) got into. They mowed down legions of iron-age soldiers and... nobody seems to mind? Where are their families? I also had some fun with the classic trope: \"they're actually hundreds of years old, soit's okay that they look like 15 year olds!\" with the harem characters. Cute. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, it's a harem anime. Whatever. It's very paint-by-numbers. All the girls are obsessed with our hero, Itami, who can do absolutely no wrong. This doesn't change in the second season, and, in fact, his little harem gets even bigger! Also, the blonde one calls him daddy. Isn't that adorable?  Unfortunately, our harem anime is also set to a backdrop of wanton murder and destruction, including battles that cost the lives of thousands of civilians, destroy entire cities, obliterate a much less developed people and paint the invaders as... the good guys? \\n\\n\r\nThey don't seem to lose a single soldier, but have no qualms with mowing down thousands. This is fucking terrifying. At first it was kind of... almost justified... but we're fuck deep in season two. This kind of murder and militaristic psychosis is absolutely disgusting at this point. I keep thinking it will slow down... and it doesn't... \\n\\n\r\nAlso, what the shit is wrong with everyone in fantasy land? None of their decisions make a lick of sense! They have to be practically force fed peace negotiations with a nation that crushes them like ants. The goal is obviously to make the JSDF look smart and generous by comparison, but it ends up just looking like a bunch of Japanese diplomats discussing foreign policy with toddlers. \\n\\n\r\nToddlers that they're threatening to kill. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty enough, most of the time, if boring. Then we get the tech porn. \\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely beautiful designs, faithful, true-to-life reproductions, gorgeous cells and flawless animation of tanks, helicopters, bazookas, machine guns, humvees, fighter jets and more. Honestly? This anime would be a thousand times better if they just cut all the pretty military porn out and set it to a good song. I'd watch that. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nForgettable, but fairly satisfying. They also re-use the same tracks over and over again. The intro and outro songs are boring and skippable. Nothing worth buying, that's for sure. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is what finally stopped me being able to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nI was invested. In the characters. I'll be honest, I'm spoiled rotten. Magical girl anime like PMMM and genre-changing hero anime like OPM have got me expecting a LOT from modern anime. Characters that break molds, situations that go from fun to dire in moments, expansive worlds and interesting art styles... this is what anime has been giving us over the past decade or so. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in anime have risen above their tropes in a multitude of ways. I kept expecting that to happen here. I kept waiting. And waiting. And WAITING. And I finally realized. \\n\\n\r\nNone of them were going to get a single modicum of growth. \\n\\n\r\nIt's disappointing. I can imagine so many ways in which all of these characters could have broken their chains. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS BELOW (but please read, before you have to see it with your eyes)\\n\\n\r\nI realized this, at the end of episode eight, when a 12 year old girl is begging for her adult crush to save her from what is insinuated as sexual slavery and possibly death. \\n\\n\r\nHe does so... not because she is a tiny child and needs his help, but because she has a crush on him. He finally says that, when she's sixteen, he'll marry her. He is painted as a hero for doing so, and he even almost gives her a kiss. Their relationship is exceptionally pedophilic and disturbing, and it is portrayed as absolute perfection and heroism. I am thoroughly disgusted, and that's what made me realize that this anime was incapable of showing character growth. \\n\\n\r\nIf they can make an adult (I'm talking in his thirties) man seem like a hero for deciding to fuck a twelve-year-old... then this anime has no idea what a decent person even looks like.  \\n\\n\r\n(And to counter the \"but when she's sixteen!!!11\" argument, *why* make her twelve, then? Why not just make her sixteen and cut out the middle man? I'll tell you why. It's to insinuate that sexualizing a twelve-year-old is okie-dokie as long as you wait to hump until she hits the age of consent... sorta. EUGH! Inexcusable.)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime CANNOT show a truly good person, or even a truly complex person, because it is written by pedophilic, nationalistic otakus who masturbate to pictures of guns and drawings of little girls. \\n\\n\r\nI am mentally scarred by seeing that with my own two eyeballs. I don't even want to see any more. I don't think I can take it. At least with the other fanservice lolitas they made an ATTEMPT to portray them as \"older\". Nine hundred years old, my ass. But with this one!? She's a literal, physical baby! She might not even have hit puberty! I *still* taste vomit. \\n\\n\r\nEND SPOILERS\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nHonestly? The first two episodes of season one are almost worth the watch. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the pedophilia, militarism, genocide and nationalism shown in the rest of the anime absolutely outweigh any enjoyment I got from this. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is not interesting. It is not groundbreaking. It is barely functional. It is completely disgusting in every possible way. I was sucked in by a premise which never delivers. \\n\\n\r\nI hate all the characters so much, at one point I was rooting for them all to be outright decimated by a fucking dragon. I regret everything I have done that led to me watching this pos anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nAwful. The two points are for the decent animation and good premise. The story, characters and all the things that make anime interesting and fun were missing or perverted. \\n\\n\r\nI should have quit at season one. I should have quit before I started! Don't make my mistake, you sweet, innocent creatures. Fly! Fly, you fools! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review is for the first season and the second season of GATE.\r\nFor a while, I had a habit of watching an episode or two of anime before I went to sleep, especially when I did not have something early to do the next day.  Since GATE came out every Friday, I decided that it was the best show to fill the pre-sleep role.  There would be no chance of accidentally binge watching fifty episodes because there would only be one episode available each day.\r\nThat was the worst decision I ever made.\r\nGATE has one of the suckiest stories I have ever watched.However, the way in which it sucks is surprising.  It has good scenario writing.  It also integrates political intrigue and military strategy masterfully, thus creating a story that is smarter than most anime out there.  So what failed?\\n\\n\r\nI think the fundamental premise is what fails.  GATE follows the story of Itami a Lieutenant in the Japanese army.  A hole in space-time in Tokyo opens to another world, one with magic, elves, dragons, and most importantly, undeveloped technology.  The Japanese army proceeds to subjugate the other side (both militarily and culturally) to \u201chelp the natives\u201d, fighting against swords with helicopters.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile all that is going on, GATE tries its best to portray the realities of war, never shying away from gore, prostitution, slavery, and slaughter.  However, in order to make it palatable to the anime audience, GATE also sets out to incorporate harem and slice of life elements into it.  So one moment, people\u2019s heads are getting blown off.  The next moment, Itami is getting doted on by a bunch of cute girls (this part is especially weird; GATE seems to want to fulfill every fetish there is).\\n\\n\r\nThis conflict between light and dark subjects is something that GATE had to resolve with the premise that it had.  It chose to solve this conflict by making the tone of the show light-hearted.   \\n\\n\r\nAs an example, here\u2019s a minor spoiler.  The JSDF (the fictional section of the Japanese military Itami is in) swoop into a city to rescue a princess from a siege, and they do this by mowing down an entire regiment of the opposing army with helicopters and machine guns, all while \u201cRide of the Valkyries\u201d is playing in the background.  If you\u2019re curious what that is, it goes da-da-da DUN DUN\u2026ok that doesn\u2019t help, but it\u2019s that song that plays in every movie when something triumphant happens.  \\n\\n\r\nThere are tons of other scenes like this in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, we might find it fun to watch.  It\u2019s kind of like a video game, right?  The targets are getting mowed down, and after a few more kills, we might get a killstreak prize (a tactical nuke!  Brag about it to your friends).  It\u2019s textbook wish fulfillment.  However, if we think about it, it\u2019s actually messed up.  Helpless soldiers on the other side are seen as justifiably stomped on, while the JSDF is seen as the benevolent civilizer.  But shouldn\u2019t it be the other way around?  Shouldn\u2019t the strong be condemned for bullying the weak?  Shouldn\u2019t the JSDF be portrayed as evil, not the opposing army?\\n\\n\r\nOf course, these are just fictional characters and no one is actually dying.  However, consider this: GATE was written by a person who used to be in the Japanese military, and is sometimes shown to Japanese military recruits.  When viewed in that light, the choice to employ a light tone in GATE feels rather manipulative.  The show tries to make us feel as if basic human rights violations are OK, using cute girls, a bright color palette, and some clever villain characterization.  In other words, GATE uses wish fulfillment to justify the unethical things that happen inside it. \\n\\n\r\nIn doing so, GATE is manipulating the minds of its audience.  The show tries to get us to turn a blind eye to military transgressions, passing them off as \u201coh, the enemy king is EEEVIL\u201d or \u201cthere was no helping it\u201d.  Eventually this leads to \u201cthe army can do no wrong\u201d.  That\u2019s dangerous.  If you\u2019re not convinced that media can influence thinking, just look at North Korea.  Somehow, the media there has convinced its people that The Fearless Leader doesn\u2019t poop.  \\n\\n\r\nSomething about all this doesn\u2019t sit well with me.  Part of the assumption that GATE makes in its propaganda campaign is that as long as there\u2019s cute girls, violence, and an interesting story, anime viewers are fine with whatever goes on.  No way that\u2019s true.  At least, I hope that it\u2019s not true.  \\n\\n\r\nThis show\u2019s problem lies not in its quality.  It lies in its ethics.  If you\u2019re going to watch, you\u2019ll have to make a decision.  You can equip critical thinking glasses, and in doing so realize that you hate being manipulated.  Or you can watch brainlessly.  Just understand the risks if you choose the latter option.\\n",

            "content": "Again A-1 Pictures has blessed us with another crappy adaptation of a light novel in a fantasy world as I\u00b4m reviewing the second core this will be a review of the entire series, I\u00b4m sry if my english isn\u00b4t the best since it\u00b4s not my mother language I\u00b4ll just try to make my points across as to why you shouldn\u00b4t watch this show.\r\nStory-2\r\nThe premise sounds cool but thats basically where the good stuff about Gate ends, the first episode was a poor introduction to the series as its the story of Itami, an otaku (for some reason because it\u00b4s completely irrelevant to the story) whois coincidentally a member of the JSDF (Japan Self-Defence Forces), he is caught in an attack from forces of the other side of the Gate, this was the first pointer to the terrible script writing this anime has. We are never given a clue to his position on the episode, he is first buying otaku goods then he is shown helping citizens and in a couple of minutes the all attack is resolved by JSDF reinforcements and it is shown Itami getting praised by his duty. The all story is basically a poundering to otakus and Japan\u00b4s military and politics while making the forces from the other gate, the media and even the United States look like bad guys. The JSDF enters the other side of the gate with the excuse of the first attack on them and the fact that they took some of their civillians hostage but then proceed to try to dominate the area through peaceful ( so they don\u00b4t look bad) conversations and try to gain control of the new area\u00b4s resources based on the fact that they don\u00b4t have any knowledge on resources like oil being valuable. Then they proceed to show Japan\u00b4s politics taking the risk of ruining their public image just so they can do the right thing all when America is trying to gain some control over the area on the other side of the gate and the media trying to make the JSDF look bad in they eyes of the public. Can we also take a moment to think to how this anime tries to potray things like revenge as a good deed and a medicine to people with PTSD and looking edgy doing it like making the victim hold a god damn bazooka to a dragon for revenge. Also any sense of conflict is inexistent considering the fact that Itami is holding a gun with him 24/7 making any kind of threat meaningless to the characters that are walking with him also he looks confident in any situation so that\u00b4s also a turnoff to any danger that might be trying to attack him. The ending was a wishfulfillment when Itami can go back to his otaku life while being surrounded by his harem of fetish girls.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 2\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a trainwreck as well im into the second season right now and no character has undergone any kind of characterization or progress being that the show focuses more on the boring story, and no, Tuka\u00b4s characterization is shallow and rushed. Itami caring for the people around him is not charactarization either since he is a light novel protagonist and you\u00b4re supposed to picture yourself in his shoes he has to be protective towards everyone nice in the show. Also for a kinda medieval fantasy setting the characters act immature and kinda retarded like they are some highschoolers in a school setting, except for the JSDF that has to be series all the time to show how great our army is. Oh and that Dark Elf or something that fuked up Tuka\u00b4s life to get her revenge so that in the fight with the dragon more faceless weirdos from he tribe can die again oh yes what a good way to revenge my comrades by killing another bunch instead of idk moving them maybe.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 3\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also all over the place and with the most basic directing ever, excluding some episodes where it looked like a superheroes movie through weird transitions. The magic used is ridiculously laughable at how boring and stupid it looks, the mood changes drastically to a more serious tone when a fight with the JSDF breaks out but in a very poor manner sometimes they switch it around just because and we got to see the most intimidating CGI dragon since Fate/Stay Night. And the second OP reuses the same clips of the first as well as being badly directed as the first one like who would think that it\u00b4s not because the show is popular that A1 would start to care.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack - 4 \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also pretty bad they use the same track all the time when a crisis breaks and sometimes even use it completely out of context in some scenes, the more easy going music is pretty typical but kinda irritating like if the show isn\u00b4t stupid enough they have to emphacise it through the music.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion-\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Dont watch this show it\u00b4s not worth your time the first season was somewhat bearable taking into account they were still introducing the characters.\\n",

            "content": "Gate is quite the fantasy journey. It is also maybe one of the most controversial anime to come out in recent years due to it's propaganda. With the tone of \"Japan is super awesome\", it's no wonder that many people can't stomach it, but that's just the surface level. The other side of the coin is the fantasy. The other world that Gate displays is very alive and basically fun to immerse oneself in. While the setting had a lot going for it, the sequence of storytelling may be the downfall of what could be great instead of good. It was like a double edgedsword with it's pacing and which characters to focus on. I believed that the first season of gate was a show with good elements that didn't take the next or extra step. It tinkled with what it had and was ultimately somewhat of a let down. This second season manages to pick up where it left and continually build the world, but it suffers the same problems the first season did. Yet again, it manages to display some positive story telling but it doesn't go the next step, instead suffers from some fan service and awful arcs. \\n\\n\r\nNow we know Gate was incredibly controversial due to it taking a nationalistic approach. All the butthurt people watching it immediately put it out as one of those government pandering and that xenophobic mindset is hindered them from witnessing a good piece of fiction. The story is incredibly more rewarding in the second season compared to the first because it takes on a more political level, albeit simple in nature. We get more perspectives of the different factions involved, the nature of the government if one decision is made and all that jazz. It's quite cringey in some moments due to some of the cast of characters, but its fun to watch. One thing that may have been it's downfall however is the lack of screentime the main characters get. Gate's drastic change in story direction is hit or miss, with a few plot holes and pacing issues especially towards the end. And the end is quite the disappointment, not really concluding nor foreshadowing anything in the future. It's a fun story to follow, but don't expect ghost in the shell 2nd gig.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are not as interesting as they were in the first season. As previously stated, the screen time Itami and his gang got was diminished. They were pretty much the backbone of the show and without them, it was a lot of political jargon and more war. However, even with the little screen time they get, each of the characters get more depth to them and more meaningful. A lot of internal conflict drives the main characters, except rory who seems to be one of those characters that is there to appeal to the fans. Side characters even get some depth to them, although the half assed villains were quite the letdown. That might contribute to the poor conclusion. The storytelling may have been too ambitious because many side characters are still unknown and seem to play a key role in the main conflict.  I liked following Itami and gang more so than the other political junkies because they have fun interactions, more meaningful relationships, especially because their bond is what the story is basically trying to replicate. Character direction could've been improved, but a twelve episode season was just too little for something as big as gate was.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound is cool. The SFX for the guns and explosions were well placed, making the action scenes more inducing to the viewer. Expect lots of killing so even if you weren't a fan of what gate brought to the table in terms of story telling, you can enjoy the slaughterfest. Less emphasis on the sound, especially with that Apocalypse Now reference last season, this one was quite the letdown in terms of OST. Needed another epic battle scene with that kind of atmosphere, but hey it was there.\\n\\n\r\nGate once again could've been great but it just settled for good. Also PSA, people really need to look past the propaganda and pandering because in the end it's just fiction. Why would Japanese writers and studios want to do a project with something that undermines them? Had to get that off my chest because people will bash the series just because of that. Now the otaku pandering is a reasonable reason, but thankfully there's a lot less of that in this season. Gate is a really good fantasy, perhaps one of the better fantasy entries in the anime industry. It's handling of characters is good, the story is enthralling sometimes, and the animation is decent. It was a fun journey to be a part of and it's setting is good enough to immerse oneself in.",

            "content": "tl;dr: Entertaining show with likeable characters and impressive art and animation, but with a very questionable agenda.\r\nThough I enyoyed the first season overall, while watching I was wondering if the messages conveyed were just artifacts of the setting and the plot or by design. Well, 2nd season proceeded to quickly erase any doubts on my part: This anime has an agenda, and it's not pretty:\r\n- The mc impersonates the classic from the recruitment center: Joining the AF means an easy job with a respectable income, social securities and best of all, some adventure abroad on top. Military accomplishment is an sure-fire way to attract potencialmates.\\n\r\n- Blatant adoration for military might and technology: Miltech will save the day, always.\\n\r\n- Endorsement of violating other people's souvereignity to further Japan's agenda. We're the good guys!\\n\r\n- Journalists are men and women of business, not integrity. Generally a hindrance when it's about doing what has to be done, namely The Right Thing (TM). The same goes for politicians.\\n\r\n- Elitism: Confronted with the achievements of Japan, other people lose all ingenuity to deal with the overwhelming cultural and military might of JP.\\n\r\n- Other nations are to be trusted to plunge a dagger in your nations spine as soon as it's back is turned.\\n\r\n- Any action regardless how questionable, can be justified with the mission/mandate. \\n\\n\r\nIn concert with the recent real political agenda of Shinzo Abe to expand activities of the military beyond Japan's border, well... connect the dots and you get the picture, or rather, the propaganda.\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to miltary themes per se, I love Girls und Panzer. But this totally lacks any ironic twist. I find the manipulative trait of this show seriously offensive.",

            "content": "This is my first review on MyAnimeList. Typically I refrain from writing reviews simply because there are many more experienced users to do so. Here I felt compelled to write my own review to clarify a very annoying assumption about this show. I've seen several people allude to or directly state that Gate is promoting right wing Nationalism and Imoerialism, as well as theorizing that it is made as propaganda to support the reinterpretation of article 9 in Japan. This notion is simply irritating. here are some facts: Gate started in 2010, the reinterpretation was proposed and enforced in 2014, this anime is an adaptationof the light novel series, as such one would presume it would follow the same plot. So to say that this anime was made as propaganda is drawing a connection where one isn't neccessary when no one asked for it. War is literally the point of the story, if there wasn't an enemy or a conflict then there wouldn't be a novel series or show. Saying that this show is propaganda is as ridiculous as saying that The Hunger Games is propaganda encouraging kids to kill each other. Just chill and watch the show for what it is, a fun and thrilling story.\\n\r\nStory:10\\n\r\nso now let's talk about the story. It continues where the first season left off. Itami is alerted that Tuka is wandering around town in search of her late father. He decides to go in searcg if the dragon to slay it in hopes of snapping Tuka back to reality. The show's main plot here is pretty simple: hit the road and go on a quest to stay a dragon. The premise is simple but the execution is absolutely thrilling. \\n\r\nWhat really stands out in terms of plot is the sub story that has been happening behind the scenes. The Empire is destabilizing and some clear power struggles are emerging between the candidates for king and those close to them. The way this involves the Japanese Defense Force is extremely interesting to watch play out. As Japan tries to reach peace treaties, the Empire reaches another setback preventing the talks from progressing. I'lol leave it at that so as not to spoil any details.\\n\r\nArt: 8.5\\n\r\nA-1 has done very well with the animation for this show. Nearly all the character designs are visually appealing. The color pallete is bright bringing out the adventurous side of this fantasy world. The backgrounds are usually inc dinky animated. Where Gate falls short probably stems from budget and or time constraints. It is not particularly uncommon to see an off model character or a stoic expression from background characters. This is what holds the art back from being great. Otherwise the art is very modern and enjoyable, so as long as you can stand the weekly off model background character for a few seconds, the time when the art shines will most definitely make up for it (especially those fight scenes).\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Gate is very enjoyable, however, It is slightly underwhelming when compared to the first season. This is not because the second season lacks good music, it's simply because you cannot beat the incredible music of the first season: the original op, and the insert sing from the heli raid. That said the music is still very fitting for the show and never ceases to aide whatever tone the show is demonstrating. The voice actors are also all solid and Rory's seiyuu particular does a phenomenal job. \\n\r\nCharacter: 9 \\n\r\nIt's hard to rate the characters of Gate. Gate has a very large cast of characters, some of which are very well developed, some of which are underwhelming. One thing that is certain is that all,the characters in Gate are in an upward trend of development. \\n\r\nItami: a very interesting main character who continues to be laid back but never falls short when it comes to protecting those he cares about\\n\r\nRory: a very fun amd provocative character constantly teasing Itami. Not much development but still a very fun character.\\n\r\nTuka: a character You WANT to love, but seems slightly out of place until this season. I'm Season one she never contributed anything notable. And in the beginning of this season it seemed as though she was going to maintain an annoying trend, however in the finale of the dragon arc she finally proved her worth and gets a pass the inconvenience she caused.\\n\r\nLelei: a character who once was very boring and stereotypical, that recently became a temporary badass. It will be interesting to see how events in the finale of the dragon arc will impact her character progressing throughout the show.\\n\r\nThe last thing I will mention is the diverse and very exciting cast if side characters. I've never been as invested in every individual character nearly as much as Gate has made me care about it's side characters with the exception of two wild cards, Zolzal and Tyuule. So far each has the potential to be great characters if the team continues to maintain the current trend, I just hope we don't see them turn into stereotypical throwaway antagonists. But alas I have faith in A-1 yet.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis show is an incredibly fun watch and will have you waiting for the next episode each weak. Never short of drama and action this show still knows when to be lighthearted without the use of slapstick gags or piss poor humor. This season Gate continues to hit the mark of being an extremely fun show to watch. It may not be nearly as complex or well written as Fate/Zero or Steins; Gate, but its damn good at what it does and that's the simple fun of the show for that reason I rate it a 10. It is not a masterpiece in comparison to some of the classics. But for what it has tried to accomplished, it has exceeded any and all expectations Incould have had so far for this series. \\n\r\nConclusion \\n\r\nIgnore the conspiracy theorists. This shows politics are not meant to be taken seriously, they are a very small but neccessary plot device to keep the show going. It IS NOT PROPOGANDA. the empire is a fictitious land, they are. It colonizing it. Sure they are searching for resources and taking advantage of trade but such is the reality of the world we live in regardless, the show never tried to convince anyone that these things are okay or that they aren't, it simply is not important. The show is a fantasy/action/military/adventure. If you came into this expecting 100% peaceful relations or a show where violence is not the response, ,aube you should try reading the tags or description of a show before you watch it. And if a show is not trying to make a point about anything, stop drawing unnecessary conclusions about simple plot devices. The real world has enough conspiracies as it is, stick to stuff that isn't completely fictional or fantasy, at the point is it really a problem with the show or the viewer? Amyways 99% of you out there will enjoy this show and some of you may love it like I do! I hope this review was helpful, I would love feedback, thank you",

            "content": "I find it remarkable how salty anime morans get when confronted by realistic scenarios inside a make-believe construct. Almost every negative review of Gate revolves around \"muh JSDF propaganda\" or \"muh fascism\" or \"muh waifus don't mix with this shiiiit muh muh muh.\" Unfortunately, I now see why normies hate anime culture so much: it easily ferments stupidity from ill-founded notions.\r\nTry this: an unknown, alien, and hostile force appears in the middle of a major city. They proceed to slaughter civilians by the thousands until being forced back. In response to the incursion and as a result of a stargate being present in the middleof a street downtown, the military sends expeditionary recon-in-force units through to ascertain where these people came from. After setting up camp they are attacked by hundreds of thousands of enemies with medieval-era technology. They defend themselves, annihilating almost all of the enemy because machine guns and artillery > wooden shields and steel swords.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing unrealistic or \"fascist\" about this. In fact, I found the JSDF to be incredibly restrained almost to the point of being unrealistic the other way. If this scenario were to be placed in New York City, Beijing, or Moscow, what would have happened? The recon-in-force would be several corps-size field armies with weapons far more sophisticated than 'Nam-era F-4s, 81mm mortars, and Type-74 tanks. The Empire would have been totally destroyed and a fake puppet government set up within weeks. Because that happened in reality against enemies with their own tanks, jets, and machine guns. Against horseback cavalry and pikemen it might even have been days.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, the same reviews bawling about \"muh fascism\" also complain about \"muh prominent Japanese flag all the time waaaaaaahhh\" because having pride in one's nation is now considered \"waah right wing boo hoooooo mommy.\" I'm actually astounded morans like this are capable of writing in complete sentences. But I'll leave that alone beyond this because apparently having different opinions is also fascist.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, Gate S1 and S2 are fantastic representations of two cultures clashing while one maintains dominant technological and moral superiority over the other. The main characters have a great range of personalities and objectives, and the dub cast voiced every single one perfectly. There are two issues I have outside of all the social commentary; first, S1 concludes with no ending, and S2 barely has one at all; second, S2 is weighed down with subplots buried within subplots. This is often the case with epic-level series--anime or live-action: subsequent seasons introduce too many narrative strings that can't be deftly handled within the runtime allotted. It doesn't prevent enjoyment in Gate's case, but it's certainly noticeable. I hope that if a third season ever gets produced it will return to the breezy charm of the first.\\n\\n\r\nBoth seasons of Gate are well worth your time. There's deep drama (that never, ever falls into the pit of melodrama) and hilarious hijinks weaved delicately through a meta-level story. There's something here for any mature adult.",

            "content": "There are no spoilers in this review. My rating system counts story for 30% of the total, characters as 30%, art as 20%, and 20% for the sound.\r\nI give this anime a 7.5 and I'll tell you why. For those looking for a brief summary, skip to the \u201cOverall\u201d at the bottom of this review. \r\nStory: 7 \r\nThe story of a new challenges arising as a result of a portal to another world opening up is not new. I\u2019ve seen it in World Trigger and I\u2019ve seen it in Zero no Tsukaima. What this anime did differently is make the other world technologicallyinferior to Japan, which I have never seen done before, and also delved into the politics of Japan as well as the new world. If not for this spin on the usual plot, I would have given the story a 6, but no matter it was not the story that carried this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and relationship between the characters were the best parts of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nItami is a brilliant commander and leader but dense when it comes to matters of love \u2013 the classic formula for the main character and center of a harem anime. For the first time, I actually didn\u2019t mind this stereotype. His lovable personality and refreshing decision to put his hobbies before work covered for his flaws. It is also nice that this anime didn\u2019t make his inability to detect romance the main focus of his screen time.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I include this in the sound rating, Rory\u2019s voice actor. Enough said. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe character design was fantastic. I love how they drew the different characters, but aside from that, the art wasn\u2019t anything special.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nIt is rare that I actually enjoy the theme music for an anime but this is a rare exception. The fact that the theme music was so epic, combined with Rory\u2019s voice actor, was enough to score this anime an 8 in sound. Lelei\u2019s voice actor had the perfect amount of innocence as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this anime so enjoyable to watch and gives it an even higher score than Erased and Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! is its ability to add original twists to an already proven formula. The classic invasion story was made more interesting by portraying the enemy to be clearly inferior to Japan and delving into the political intrigue of the new world. The main character of this harem anime acted as a fool when love was involved but rather than focusing on that minor detail, the anime focused on his reliability and general badassness.  The art and sound worked well together to bring out the charm and humor of the characters. A solid anime all around and I look forward to the next season.\\n",

            "content": "Review Text\r\nI'm going to review both the first and second season, so I'll just put my review here. The second season is pretty much the same as the first in terms of content and quality, if even less.\r\nStory - 2\r\nAssault rifles going against man in bronze armour armed with shield and pikes, and making a big deal out of it. Yup. Animated JSDF go on an absolute slaughterfest in an alternate world in the bronze age, and made out to be the good guys... and it's not propaganda... nope nope nope. =_=\r\nArt - 5\r\nArt is alright, not great, nothing to boast about.\r\nSound - 4\r\nvery realisticweapon sound, music timed well but mundane.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3\\n\\n\r\nOf character developments there were... none. Every supporting character sound like JSDF recruitment officers. Even the MCs only bobs up and down on the waves of the plot, taking no initiatives, The villain was actually the most developed character\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2\\n\\n\r\nIt's not all that bad, Japanese right winged nationalism notwithstanding. There was some GGRM-esque sprouts of political intrigue in the manga original, and fewer in the first anime season, but they were quickly snipped in the bud in favour of scenes of outright massacre.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"good\" guys completely slaughters the \"bad\" guys from the get-go. The enjoyment derives from the same kind of satisfaction you'd feel after swatting a  gnat. It's basically the whole story.\\n\\n\r\nAll the enemy commanders are idiots, all your allies are geniuses with a heart of gold and nerves of steel, even the lolis (on your side) are mastermind diplomats, and the Japanese army is nothing if not the very definition of humanitarianism.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, one little plus for the continued reference to the fate/stay night series, a pleasant surprise. Bumping the score from 1 to 2 for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3.5\\n\\n\r\n3 is poor and 4 is decent, and this is almost decent, thus 3.5.\\n\\n\r\n[As per wikipedia: Propaganda is a form of biased communication, aimed at promoting or demoting certain views, perceptions or agendas.]\\n\\n\r\nHad the Chinese made an anime (ignore for a moment the fact that non-indie Chinese animes are pure shit) depicting a Chinese army going into an alternate universe and saving people of a Tibetan-esque theocracy from its bloody thirsty ruler... Oh just imagine the uproar... but this is literally the same thing.\\n\\n\r\nAs a history major, watching this is almost unnerving. It's almost comedic watching the almost fictional Japanese invasion force taking an opponent with Roman era technology as seriously as they'd would the Russians.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard not to draw parallels between this anime and the reality of the current Japanese politics, now that the Japanese military is free to invade other countries again.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, off topic, sorry for being conscious that history does in fact, repeats. Anyway, if you have no mind for history and have a few hours to waste on a well animated Japanese right wing propaganda, you've found the right show.",

            "content": "For the most part we would like to dismiss this as another fantasy adventure based anime where people find themselves in an alternate world, where everything is like an RPG game. But unlike the usual where the main character is a young boy, here it involves an adult...........or a group of adults who were cast in this kind of anime, which is unusual since author  Takumi Yanai is targeting young adults, so it wouldn't be a surprise if this anime has violence, prostitution and vice in it so:\r\nStorywise, the theme of the anime was simply based upon the metaphor of what history education thatJapan teaches to their youngsters about Japan's involvement during world war 2. Were to them, Japan's intention was to liberate the whole Asian region of foreign domination but made no acknowledgement that they plan to only to replace it with their own domination, so frankly I really don't like how the metaphor of the anime or manga implying. Also, the plot has that geopolitical theme in it where it imply that Japan should no longer follow it's pacifistic stance and should take an active role for their military , which, by the way is something that their PM, Shinzo Abe is campaigning for. Now I don't about you, but IMO I think Japan should remain within its Pacifistic stand.\\n\\n\r\nArtwise, well we don't see a lot of fanservices around, I don't, know if them girls being in the onsen counts, but quiet frankly only the angle prostitute is the only one whom we get to see some panty service. So, when watching, don't expect any full melons in this anime, but overall the background works are very good, thought they're still the usual things one would see in any similar anime with  a fantasy and adventure genre. But what I really like was the uniforms of them JSDF, but it seems that somebody didn't tell the background designer  MacDonald Scott, that the JSDF Air Force's  McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom is colored in camouflage green and it is always manned by two person, one is the pilot and the other is a Radar Interception Officer who sits at the back.\\n\\n\r\nSoundwise, well I'd say for Risa Taneda to voice Rory Mercury was pretty amazing and also the gun shot and all that KABOOM where realistic in a sense. But it really nice that the seiyu who did Itami's voice, Swabe Junichi it relly felt natural, at least he doesn't have to pretend to be a teen . The open song fit well with the anime and so as the ending song, but I just don't like them. Also , Tomasu Haruka to play a teenage princess Pina Colada, doesn't have that young intonation anymore and should have been the one to play Aoi Risa, instead of being Pina Colada...I think I'll have another one, the drink I mean.\\n\\n\r\nOn the character, well, if we're to take notice of some of the character name, we counld surmise that it probabaly has something to do with the author, Takumi Yanai's like the Pina Colada, why he name the Italica Princess from a rum based cocktail we'd never know, but we can conclude that he or she, probably like that kind of drink  of course there is also a certain character called \"Beef eater\" now I don't know if he or she got that from those sissy royal guards from Buckingham palace or from a brand of Gin with the same name, but if she or he did, then they probably drink lots of it. Now, there is that Gothic Lolita Rory Mercury, did  Takumi Yanai got that name from Freddie Mercury??????WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS MY  FRIENDS...AND WE'LL KEEP FIGHTING TILL THE END, WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, WEEE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, NO TIME FOR LOSERS..........Oh dear sorry about the troll, well we can assume that Rory's name was based from that guy. and there is Tuka Marceau where Mr. Takumi got that character's name we also never know, but as I see it Itami was still the usual harem dude except that he's more adult like than a teenager and the harem member are just limited to Lelei, Rory and Tuka, however I don't the idea that he was made to be this lolicon, in fact most of the character here were made to focus on the lolicon theme like Sugawara and Sherry which to me is kinda disgusting for the author to do. Despite of of the flaws the characters were still able to provide some entertainment for us audience. So......\\n\\n\r\nHow entertaining is this anime from it;s 1st and 2nd sequel? It entertaining enough....to a certain point.\\n\\n\r\nBut, in its overall  I give it a \"4\" as in decent enough to watch, since I can't forgive this anime's geopolitical metaphor and the lolicon theme applied to some character.",

            "content": "Okay so I discovered the Gate series randomly and decided to give it a go. By the end of the second season and especially throughout the second season, my interest and enjoyment had grown more and more as I eagerly watched to see what would happen next.\r\nStory: \r\nWhen I started this series I immediately fell in love with the plot and the mix between 'our world' and the 'fantasy world' aspect of it.\r\nI personally haven't watched much or any anime that has had such a strong military theme, but my gosh did I enjoy it! \r\nIt ended up being a fresh storyline and plot forme to experience and enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 is more serious than the first but I think that's a good thing as they were able to focus more on character development and the main storyline. There are a few surprising scenes even though it was censored, I was surprised to see them include elements of rape, abuse, ect but they were only brief moments.\\n\r\nOverall the story kept me well engaged as I even ended up binge watching season 2 over two days. In my case the series got me rooting for Itami and the gang, as well as despising Zorzal so much that I couldnt wait to see what pain and fate awaited him. I would of liked to see more screen time for certain characters like Rory for example. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is the same as the first season. I thought the character designs were cute and fitted each personality well. The battle scenes were well done and I enjoyed watching how the military's combat plans and missions were executed. Overall the art is quite detailed and I enjoyed watching the planes and battle scenes most, although I have seen better art in other series it is still very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI thought the OP song was good maybe not something I would listen to but it was decent. I loved the OP animation more than the song to be honest.  \\n\r\nI loved the character voices, I found Rory's constant sexy voice hilarious and thought the voices overall matched each character well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, I personally feel the characters developed more during the second season. Zorzal was a successfully made villain as they got me hating his character so much. \\n\r\nIt was nice but brief the small romantic gestures/looks throughout the series that brought certain characters together. I always personally love a good romance plot/subplot but I have to admit that this series is fine as it is; focusing more on the action rather than the romance. I love the female Knights characterisation and how cute and kick ass they are. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis series may not be a masterpiece but that doesn't mean it's not worth your time. I for one am glad I found this anime and stuck with it to watch the second season! It's an interesting and fun series with a slightly dark undertone in some aspects during the second season, and very well done. I had a great time watching it and recommend it to anyone who loves or wants to try/continue watching an interesting action adventure series which brings two different worlds and ways of life together revolving around the Japanese Military. If you have already watched season one, then I highly recommend watching season two as it continues the story very well and leaves you satisfied with its progression and for the most part it's conclusion.\\n",

            "content": "The second part of GATE is much more interesting than its first season.\r\nThe story is darker and explains many things that were not even mentioned in the first season. We get to know new interesting and fresh characters, keeping the high standards of the show. The way this season brings a lot of problems to our protagonists and how they suffer to get over them is amazingly executed. I have to say I was feeling really nervous while watching most if the intense scenes this season has, which again shows us how well developed the story is.\r\nStory: 10.\r\nThe animations is still outstanding. Excellent quality ofimage and an incredible screenplay. I would say the animation is better in this season that the previous one, and that's something we don't get from any anime. Although I don't like CGI, I have to say this show has an intelligent way to use it, which is exclusively for the JSDF's vehicles and weaponry. It's the perfect contrast between modern warfar and medieval armament.\\n\r\nArt: 10.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much variaton in music in this season even though it was released one year later, which is kind of disapointing. Nevertheless, the soundtrack is still amazing and makes the action scenes more enjoyable. I still have complains with the SFX quality, but that doesn't mean it's bad. We hear new sound effects related to magic and combat situations. We can hear new voices between the JSDF troops and some other are a bit familiar.\\n\r\nSound: 9. High quality but poor variaton.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are as amazing as always. As I said before, we get to know new faces during the season, being Zorzal the most notorius of them all. Unfortunately, character development is really poor and slow most of the cases. I think the character who grew the most is Lelei La Lelena since she becomes a really important piece of the story.\\n\r\nCharacters: 9. Interesting characters but poor development in most of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are more dynamic and, in some cases, \"mature\" than in the first season. The obvious advantage of the JSDF over their enemies is taken with a well made black humour. Itami shows us his Ranger and S capabilities without forgetting his kindness. We get to see some magic duels and medieval battles too, so the pack for me is complete.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the second season of GATE is way better than its first counterpart. More enjoyable with better story and development of the trama. Please do not drop GATE in its first season or you'll be missing and incredible season two.",

            "content": "Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri 2nd Season ; or actually Gate season 1.5 (indeed, the whole show was initially composed of 24 episodes but they decided to split it into 2x12 episodes and aired them during 2 consecutive seasons) was the direct continuation of the events shown previously.\r\nBasically it starts directly at episode 13 instead of episode 1 (considering it would be a new season... which isn't the case in fact). Naturally it requires to have watched the season 1, as you can guess. \r\nGate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri comes back with the squad we discovered, starring Itami, Rory (best girl), Leleil, Yao& Tuka, going on new adventures with a political & military background as usual. This time, you won't focus on big fights opposing knights and archers versus tanks and choppers with a \"Ride of the Valkyries\" from Richard Wagner background. No indeed, season 2 puts the ton on political side, especially with the introduction on an important diplomat in charge of the negociation between Japan and Empire.\\n\\n\r\nHowever do not despair : you will watch an exciting scene of a dragon behind blew up with C4 & rocket launchers, then her 2 babies will respectively take missiles in the teeth and bombs in the nose. Season 2 was - in my opinion - more serious than its older sister. Cruelty, violence and backstab are your introduction dish, then help yourself with a full plate of cute / soft moments with Itami's squad. To be fair, these parts annoyed me sometimes because on a side they introduce a great battlefield and on the other side, they give you an irritating fight between magical sisters.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Gate season 2 (more like 1.5) was pleasant to watch but there are some negative points I should enlighten. Indeed, many characters were introduced in the season 1 and the second season brings even more... god too many so that it is impossible to remember everyone's name... Quite a waste by it surely sticks to the original plot. \\n\\n\r\nAbout a possible season 3 : the anime ended about 3 years ago from this day. Season 2 ending was torn between concluding the show forever (showing couples, our hero back to his regular life, new heir for the Empire, etc) but it also gave huge hints of a possible return. For example, we learned that the 3rd son of Emperor Molto left his native realm to make a colation of foreign countries, in order to defeat his own brother. Talking about the brother : he himself left the city with his manipulative slave Tyuule, thinking about another day of fight. These 2 brothers still alive with their titles & powers could easily lead to another conflict involving Japan. And as I quickly read : light novel or manga could cover a 12 episode season 3 and even 4 (or a single 24 episodes season 3).\\n\\n\r\nSadly, even if the manga is still ongoing, I convinced myself that there won't be anymore screen time for our favorite squad (Rory best girl). Time to read the manga ! I still recommend this anime if you appreciated season 1 because it brings a continuity and still keeps great joyful fights, mixing modernity and tradition.\\n\\n\r\nEdit : I didn't finish yet to read every chapters covering season 2 but it is still possible to make a clear statement. As I mentionned in my S1 review, both anime & manga versions were looked alike, anime was even better on some points (power of sound !) and the fact 12x24 minutes were greatly enough to cover everything and even add a few more scenes (especially Gate's first battle).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I already noticed that a lot of scenes drew in the written version were simply cut from the animated version. To spoil a bit : most cut parts are quite tiny, like discussions between some characters, taking 1-2-3 pages. Or another part I wished to watch animated : when Itama goes on the flame dragon hunt, his superiors decide to send reinforcements. The manga shows the whole deployment, including tanks moving across a river and meeting fishmen, arriving at a city where Duran gets recognized, etc. It does not change the whole plot but these scenes add a little something appreciated !\\n\\n\r\nBut where I am currently reading, there seems to be the first major event, that is (if you don't want to read it, please go to the next paragraph)...\\n\r\nLelei being sick due to some strange illness they meet in a village, after starting a ressources exploration.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, it is easy to figure out that they faced a lack of available screentime, so they managed to conclude the anime without adding another episode or OVA. But it cannot erase the fact some parts seem to be rushed. However, I can only recommend reading the manga if you appreciated Gate season 1 and / or 2. In my opinion, animated version of season 1 is really similar to its parent, while animated season 2 differs a lot from the written version (due to an obligation to cut a few parts).\\n\\n\r\n2nd edit : It eventually didn't take me long to finish reading the 82 chapters released. In fact, most of them were published after the anime finished airing (1 per month, approximately) so the story really differs from the anime. I mean, Gate's animated version managed to put an end to the plot but they also left hints for a possible third season. However, you have to know that chapter 82 (latest one) does not reach the anime's ending. So that means there is no manga material to cover up anything in anime. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, even if we won't -probably- get to watch anymore of Gate's serie on screen, the written version still brings a lot & a lot of content that wasn't in the anime. Simply because they needed to clear everything up in order to give it a proper ending. That's why I felt the second season was rushed, some parts weren't related correctly and some major ones event got cut out. If you ever felt disappointed by any episode, just go and read the manga (if I remember correctly, second season starts around 28th chapter) : you will not regret it ! Even better : the war is not over yet, our best squad hasn't arrived yet to the capital to rescue the princess, and they even face another side of the war, that was mentioned but not shown.\\n\\n\r\nI have great hopes for a decent ending in the written version.\\n",

            "content": "When it comes to tv it's a fact of life, making second seasons to already great shows are difficult. Trying to transfer that quality into a brand new sequel and season and trying to continue the series isn't that easy. This is further exemplified in the second season of Gate where I can safely say it's great. However I still felt something was just missing that was present in the first season.\r\nThe main premise of the second season of gate is quite similar to the first. It chronicles the political relationship between Japan and the world in the other side of the gate. Thisincludes talks of peace and war as well as shrewd power struggles and corruption. As this is described we also discover more about Itami and his own endeavors with the three main girls, the elf tuka,The magician leilei, and the Demi god Rory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in this second season was pretty interesting. The fire dragon arc was very entertaining and you defiantly wanted to see these characters kill this gigantic fire dragon especially when you discover more about the other characters. The politics of the empire are also well described with the addition of Zolzal and Tyuule and the political power struggle. \\n\\n\r\n However a major problem I do have with the story is that the characters don't seem to grow and learn with the exception of one character. In the first season it seems that they're constantly learning about the new world they live in and it doesn't seem like that in the second season. And it also seems at points that they are telling two different stories and that Itami is just isolated from the political struggle. However gate had a good ending even though there is room for more story to be created.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of gate are still as entertaining as ever despite my above complaint. There are also some great new characters that were added new to this season. This includes the dark elf Yao and the crown prince Zolzal. Zolzal was an awesome villain because of the elaboration of his schemes and his cunning. However a problem is that some characters fail to acquire further development in this season except for Tuka. Tuka's mental condition was well explained and she had an amazing relationship with Itami. Itami was still a great character and very entertaining. I did have a problem with the fact that he was slightly disconnected from his theme.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the second season was quite good. While the OST wasn't as memorable the opening theme and ending theme were both excellent and they definitely stood up to the first season. The animation gate was stunning no doubt. The colors were beautiful and the flow of the animation was very good. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion the second season of gate was indeed very great. It managed to tell a compelling story. However there were some significant incongruencies. Despite that both seasons of gate are definitely worth watching and the seamless blend of genres with some very entertaining characters definitely is the recipe for a very great and fun series.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nGate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri 2nd Season, much like its predecessor, makes me think about the advancement of technology. Last time, it was weapons. This time, it is transportation.\r\nWe started with running on the ground. Then we tamed horses. Then we drove cars. Then we took subways. And then we piloted helicopters. We, as a people, have made advancements in movement at a rate that we (figuratively and ironically) cannot keep up with.\r\nThe citizens of the Empire within Gate (reducing the title at this point) are still stuck with just horses. And, sadly, theyare still stuck with a mediocre anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nGate returns for the continuation to its split-cour season. Tuka Luna, Rory, Lelei, and of course Youji also return to take care of the problems facing the Japanese army and the mighty Empire.\\n\\n\r\nThis time around, Gate still takes advantage of its premise \u2013 namely, the overwhelming might of the Japanese army against a kingdom who still dwells within the realm of swords and castles. Delegates witnessing a contained demonstration of mortar shells, jets bombing strategic buildings, and paratroopers raining from the skies make the distinction between these two sides clearer.\\n\\n\r\nThis season even manages to down the patriotic platform that the first season felt dripped in. This new direction occurs because the anime focuses more on the mythical rather than the military, but it removed that saturated feeling of a pushed ideology.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the anime has to worry less about establishing a setting and its characters and instead can focus on its narrative. To this end, the anime comes up with many different plotlines all tied together by a singular, overarching one. Namely, Tyuule\u2019s destruction (from the inside) of the Empire.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the various, smaller plotlines. To be fair to Gate, it creates a lot of conflict that does not tread into repetitive territory. That is, for the most part, much of what happens remains relevant while also differentiating itself enough to be interesting. The start of the season has more slice-of-life material with Tuka\u2019s strange delirium. Afterwards, the anime becomes darker as Youji and the gang square off against a fire-breathing dragon.\\n\\n\r\nThen Lelei\u2019s aside at the magical city contrasts with the upheaval happening back in the capital. All the while, a plot of assassination, a peace-brokering dilemma, and a mysterious enemy stir up the narrative that much more. Everything ends with a final, Japanese-military mission to thwart the evil in place and bring happiness to both sides of the Gate.\\n\\n\r\nAs can be read, a lot goes on over the course of just twelve episodes. So Gate gets a few more props. Now, whether or not it executed these various plotlines, juggled them all together in an appropriate manner, is another matter entirely.\\n\\n\r\nFor some of the conflicts, they do bring tension. The assassination attempt by Delilah, Sugawara breaking neutrality by helping Sherry, and the imprisonment of Pi\u00f1a by Zorzal. These conflicts keep with the plot\u2019s motif (fantasy versus military) as well as allow the plot to proceed naturally from one major conflict to the next.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, Gate has quite a few plotlines that are downright mishandled. One of the strangest plotlines occurs with Lelei\u2019s summons to Rondel for her \u201cacademic presentation\u201d as Youji puts it. As a whole, two separate problems exist.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the plotline means nothing to the larger narrative. They could have gone anywhere else, done anything else, and the outcome would have been the same. And second, the \u201cPied Piper\u201d subplot. He (or she for all we know) is that \u201cmysterious enemy\u201d mentioned earlier. But the anime never reveals the identity of she (or he) let alone resolves his (or her) plotline.\\n\\n\r\nThe dragon battle is not without its own problems, too. To be fair, the battle itself is fairly engaging, taking advantage of the show\u2019s premise once more with magical swords and landmine explosions. Altogether, a pretty cool battle.\\n\\n\r\nThis conflict faults elsewhere. Besides the fact that the anime provides a minimal (minimal) amount of information on the dark elves, the anime attempts to squeeze in an extra conflict. A couple of baby dragons, led by an Apostle similar to Rory, make trouble. They exist as means to show off the Japanese military a bit \u2013 fighter jets and tanks engage in one-sided combat. Which is acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nBut that Apostle, who indirectly decimated Yao\u2019s and Tuka Luna\u2019s clans as well as many others, and who showed up to begin with to take Rory back to Hardy (their leader), runs away. Worse still, Gate does not revisit this conflict in earnest for the remainder of the season, making one wonder what the point was of introducing it to begin with. This small conflict was nothing short of tacked on.\\n\\n\r\nThe most egregious issue, however, happens near the end. Youji and his team (that includes his newfound friends as well as his soldiers) infiltrate the castle, defeat a giant, and save both the Emperor and Pi\u00f1a. They won. But instead of taking out Zorzal. Instead of beating him up to a bloody pulp (again) to put him in his place. Instead of even just taking him prisoner for the numerous atrocities he\u2019s committed and the moronic actions he\u2019s taken. They let him go free.\\n\\n\r\nThe argument is that Youji and the Japanese army will always know where he is and how to find him. But when such a dangerous (and dense) dude has shown to be such an abysmal person, not taking any actions against him \u2013 when any military in their right mind would (and they themselves have touted their prowess) \u2013 is nothing short of silly.\\n\\n\r\nAs if that weren\u2019t silly enough, his last line about getting revenge against Youji and the Japanese indicates that this convenient turn of events exists solely to have him cause unnecessary mayhem at some point in the future. Altogether, this admittedly minor event is absolutely asinine.\\n\\n\r\nEven the themes encounter trouble. Themes on war, like the media\u2019s inaccurate portrayal or the aftereffects of being a prisoner, are briefly shown or talked about. Unfortunately, they are never made into strong talking points. Still, the anime never intended to investigate these ideas in full; after all, its focus was more on the mixture of mythical and militaristic elements.\\n\\n\r\nAlongside the surprising lack of world-building, Gate\u2019s narrative\u2019s negatives outweigh its positives, making it a weak tale in summation.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation for Gate remains relatively the same from last season.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the military tech \u2013 tanks, fighter jets, etc. \u2013 as well as the giant dragon use CG art that passes an acceptable level. Some CG segments, such as a wave of armor-clad guards, does not pass, but those scenes are not as common.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, the anime\u2019s signature paneled view, where multiple rectangular sections showcase characters or scenes happening simultaneously, returns. And, once again, it adds a bit of variety to the festivities at hand. What does not return is the Japanese side of the Gate. Losing out on the dichotomous aesthetics seems like a mistake, but, since the anime had all of its business on the Empire\u2019s side, this loss is forgiven.\\n\\n\r\nLocations visited include the makeshift town, the capital\u2019s different sectors, and the mountainous region where the dragon lays. Not too much variety and not too much detail makes the art less impressive than it otherwise is.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, the character designs and the animation are exempt from this treatment. The cast keep their same colorful, detailed looks from the first season. Tuka\u2019s long blonde hair with modernized (for Earth) white t-shirt and tight jeans. Rory\u2019s fancy dress, bow, and gargantuan axe. Lelei\u2019s all-blue attire. Newer characters, like Zorzal\u2019s regal outfit and Tyuule\u2019s original unkempt and later kempt looks, keep with the norm. The other citizens of the Empire all vary in size, shape, and appearance, adding even more variety to the designs.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while Youji and the Japanese are decidedly plain in their looks, their plainness continues to contrast them with the fantastical land \u2013 an important motif throughout the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation likewise sees highs. While the anime does not define itself through animation, certain segments \u2013 such as the dragon battle, the first skirmish in the castle\u2019s main hall, and the final battle against the giant \u2013 include a lot of magic, acrobatics, and explosions to make those fights that much more intense. To be fair, fights of this magnitude are not always happening, but downtime also includes lots of hair, eye, and limb movements from the characters to get even the \u201cslower\u201d segments moving.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe only truly influential newcomer is Tyuule.\\n\\n\r\nRight from the get-go, her character is a tragic one as she finds herself at the hands of her captor Zorzal. But as the audience soon learns, she is not just a tragic character but also a dark character. A dark character with more than sinister intentions.\\n\\n\r\nHer captivity and darkness stem from a past event involving her and her people. Unfortunately, the anime quickly passes over her backstory with just a couple of frames worth of flashback. The audience loses out on who she was as a person before, and, as such, the show fails to put her plight into perspective.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, she follows through on her ultimate revenge: destroying the Empire. She pretends to be enamored with Zorzal, eventually becoming his main advisor. She feeds false information to cause chaos. She poisons the king to place his beyond-incompetent son into power to spark civil turmoil. While she does not normally directly take part in the craziness, she stirs the pot to a boiling point all the same.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, she says that she destroyed the Empire, but that\u2019s not really the case. The Japanese army didn\u2019t needlessly kill civilians (going so far as to save important peace delegates). Plus, not only do they save the king, but also Pi\u00f1a. She is the main advocate on the Empire\u2019s side vying for peace between them and the Japanese, and she becomes queen of the land, ushering in a new age of prosperity.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason for Tyuule\u2019s failed revenge is seen in the tears that fall from her face. What she wanted wasn\u2019t revenge \u2013 she wanted her life back. The people she befriended, the land she held, and the happiness she had. All of which revenge could not bring her. In other words, her character represents the idea that seeking revenge is a futile venture.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the idea is nice, but the execution is not.\\n\\n\r\nTuka Luna also goes through a degree of tragedy herself but nowhere near the same level as Tyuule. In the beginning of the season, Yao confronts Tuka, making her think about the loss of her own clan and, more specifically, the loss of her father. Unfortunately, while there are parallels between Tuka and Yao \u2013 both are of elfish descent, both lost their clan, etc. \u2013 the anime does not explore these throughputs.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, Tuka goes practically insane. So insane, in fact, that she moves beyond pretending that her father is not dead and wandering the city in search of him. Instead, she begins to believe that Youji is her father. He goes along with the charade for a time, demonstrating that kindness can sometimes only be a Band-Aid rather than a remedy.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, though, Youji decides to find that cure. Knowing that Tuka needs to overcome her warped perception, he and the girls finally do what the Japanese army won\u2019t: take the fight to the dragon. While many perish, Youji and, more importantly, Tuka succeed in taking down the beast, freeing Tuka of the madness that clouded her mind for much too long.\\n\\n\r\nArguably, Tuka still calling Youji \u201cDad\u201d does not really seem as though she has gotten better, but it is still nice to know that she has accepted her reality for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast lack much in terms of character depth. Zorzal is meant to be an arrogant, ignorant, and vile person. His personality makes him easy to hate but leaves little room for complexity. Yao Ha Ducy has an interesting development when she continues her do-whatever-she-must attitude by hurting (and thereby helping) Tuka. But the anime quickly forgets about Yao following the first half of this season.\\n\\n\r\nYouji does little else besides be the everyman. The anime tries to give him some backstory, as well as parallelism with Tuka, in the form of a deranged mother, but it is hastily handed to the audience. Rory, once again, does not amount to much as a character because the anime does not give her any proper screen time and hence any proper developments. As for Lelei, she rarely has impact and intrigue except during a few of the battles.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, these three are not without their positives. Youji\u2019s ability to do everything contrasts with his inherent, just-want-to-relax self, adding comedy to his character. Rory gives the group utmost safety. And the anime juxtaposes Lelei with both her older sister and the magical town, making her level of intelligence more apparent.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the most interesting trait of the characters is the group dynamic. The group itself is actually pretty weak \u2013 they do not interact with one another all that much. But their individual relationships with Youji make their whole group quirky. At least, quirkier than it already is.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the harem members looks to Youji as her dad. One of them acts as his guardian. One of them thinks of him as a mentor. One of them believes him to be the kingdom\u2019s savior. And one of them is literally a technical possession of his. They all show signs of romance, but it\u2019s their strange relationships to Youji that make their group, well, quirky.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track for Gate brings the rock. While the quick guitar solo comes out of nowhere at the end, the guitar riffs, nice vocal work, and pounding drums work together to make a tough and cool track that fits the anime well.\\n\\n\r\nIn heavy contrast, to both the OP and the anime as a whole, the ending track takes on quite the lighthearted tone. Tuka, Rory, and Lelei take turns singing to the slow, happy beat, making for a calm send-off to each high-stakes episode. The ED is even pretty catchy. Arguably, it contrasts a bit too much with action-heavy show, but it\u2019s still a nice piece all around.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, given that this season is the continuation of a split-cour, Gate using much of the same original soundtrack is no surprise. Lots of military-esque tracks with trumpets and leveled tunes. Violin-heavy tracks that set the mood for the battles to come. And relaxing-fantasy ones for those slice-of-life segments. Once again, the OST fits but does not leave a lasting impression.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting likewise sees similar performances as last season. Ami Koshimizu as Tyuule goes cruel. Risa Taneda as Rory combines craziness and sexiness. And Hisako Kanemoto as Tuka Luna continues her mature yet cute voice for all to hear. In short, everyone involved does an above-average job.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve talked about this before, but one of the major reasons why an anime like this pulls me along is for me wanting, nay needing, to ensure that the safety of the characters holds up. Or, at the minimum, that the characters \u201cwin\u201d in the end.\\n\\n\r\nSo it came as no surprise to me that Tyuule\u2019s safety, considering her deplorable situation, had me wanting to see more of the season. Again, not because of the dragon or the military, but because I needed to know that she would be safe once all was animated and done.\\n\\n\r\nI somewhat got my wish in that she ruined Zorzal\u2019s life to an extent. But I was disappointed that she still seemed to be following him. In essence, I wanted to see her do more. Run away, destroy him. Anything to make me feel as though she were heading towards a bright future. Sadly, that didn\u2019t happen.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character in the anime is actually Yao Ha Ducy, but, once the dragon arc ended, she became an almost permanent side character as events unfolded that did not directly concern her. Tuka Luna is next on my list of favorites, but the whole \u201cdad\u201d direction she took knocked down her appeal a few pegs.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters I did not much care for. Rory is a bit annoying, Lelei doesn\u2019t have much presence. As for Youji, he was not funny and was not relatable, so he, too, failed to be an entertaining character.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, my favorite part was the end. Not Pi\u00f1a\u2019s crowning or Youji getting screwed out of taking part in his hobby once more. It was the quick showcasing of the different pairings that had been made over the course of the season.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the pairing between Sherry and Sugawara is weird due to their ages, it was still nice to see the show acknowledge these different relationships and where they were at or where they were going. Extra kudos to the pairing between Delilah and Akira, the assassin and the assassee (I just made that word up; I\u2019m not sure why it isn\u2019t a word considering the word \u201cassassin\u201d itself), for sharing an unexpected yet welcomed romance.\\n\\n\r\nGate: Jieitai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri 2nd Season encounters both highs and lows. Some tense moments in the story riddled with silly conclusions. A quirky group lacking individual development. And some nice artistic and musical pieces brought down by unsatisfying characters. It looks like, for the time being, this one will have to continue being content with its horses.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, while the premise still holds, the patriotism has been toned down, and some of the conflicts bring tension, many plotlines are handled poorly, the final conflict is asinine, and the unexplored themes only get in the way\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, okay artistic direction, nice character designs, above-average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Tyuule and Tuka Luna are okay, as are the quirky connections of the main group, but Youji, Rory, and Lelei still have issues being worthwhile characters\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, good ED, okay OST, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, unfortunate outcomes and some boring characters, but at least some romance was had\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "I'm a little too busy following the presidential campaign and Tokyo earthquakes and my own career to pay attention to Japan's military situation, but from what I can gather, they're starting to recover from choosing the wrong side in WWII and they have a bit of a hissy fit when China enters their eye. So I couldn't really tell you how accurate Gate is in representing their defense forces or if it's all that successful at recruiting otaku to join the JSDF, but speaking as someone who refuses to join the military on account of how I wouldn't survive ten seconds in a Full MetalJacket camp, I can safely say that if the show had been about Americans overpowering Middle-Earth with nukes, I'd think \"how fucking stupid do you think I am?\". It's the fact that I never feel the soldiers are in any danger that's always gotten to me about Gate. There's nothing fun about conflicts when either side has an advantage over each other so large it makes the San Andreas fault look like a housefly. I make fun of Harry Potter for never introducing guns in the war against Voldemort, but let's be honest with ourselves. It wouldn't have made good fiction, and it would have made things a lot more tediously complicated.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, is there really no person equivalent to Rory's fighting abilities and status on the fantasy people's side? If a foreign country can recruit a demon without too much trouble, I'm sure the homeland country can interest her sister with something.\\n\\n\r\nSo Gate 2 pretty much picks off where Gate 1 left off, except not really because I remember the first half ending with the characters agreeing to fight some dragons and that doesn't happen until a few episodes into this cour. There's not really much in here that's changed between halves either. It's still a bunch of military propaganda saying \"join us now. We have cute girls and we are the most powerful force in the world, so you don't have to worry about getting killed and you can do your otaku hobbies during break\". The fantasy people are pretty much just a bunch of idiots who couldn't put up a good fight against a machine gun to save their lives. And the production is still fine, although I'm getting annoyed at how all A-1 Pictures' character designs have the same flatness to their style like they hired the Sword Art Online character designer for every single thing they work on.\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn't really do a whole lot to ramp things up in this cour either. As expected from light novel land, the plot is pretty much just a bunch of interchangeable conflicts that are supposed to give off a sense of progression, but I call it a desperate attempt to cover up the fact that you're not going to change the status quo. Occasionally, one of the three female fantasy characters on Itami's side will face a personal conflict, but it's always for the character's sake and never for the story's. I don't really understand how the elf girl's amnesia plotline really added to anything, nor do I understand what Rory contributes being an overpowered being on a side that's already overpowered. In fact, I don't think Itami goes through any sort of character arc either in this show, despite being the main character. The story ends with him resuming his daily life, only to get annoyed when the fantasy girls tag along, which is an ending that would get laughed at if any military movie in the States pulled that shit.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, whilst I've sort of accepted Gate's stupidity by the time I got to watching the series, it still fails without the nationalism angle because it's just boring and uncreative with the conflicts in general. As I said before regarding Marvel stuff, as well as critically acclaimed action films like Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and The Nice Guys to a lesser extent, I don't like conflicts where the villains the good guys have to face are something I could have scraped off a first draft for a Silver Age comic book or a Ubisoft game. Not a single person that Itami's crew has to face are the least bit memorable, and they're so ill-equipped to fight them anyways that it doesn't really make much of a difference. Plus, when you're basically making dragons extinct with fighter jets, there's really not a whole lot you can do to raise the stakes any higher.\\n\\n\r\nThis is particularly true during the final fight, where I don't think the opposing side put a scratch on any of our heroes. Itami and his mini-harem pretty much slaughter the giants, walk out with the princess, and then the show just ends with what I assume is the main villain swearing revenge. I know the novel series is still going, but I wouldn't have known that if I didn't look it up, because that finale sure seemed to assume that there was nothing left to say. And before you ask, no I don't remember who the main villain was and I don't care to look him up. I can't even remember if he was the guy who was raping princesses with bunny ears or not. That's how little an impact that guy had.\\n\\n\r\nI guess Gate will be your thing if you like the idea of meshing fantasy and military together in the same way that most people like Space Jam because they like the idea of NBA Basketball and the Looney Tunes coexisting with each other, in which case fuck you guys because that movie was terrible and I have no idea why we're getting a sequel or roping the director of the good Fast & Furious movies into the thing. Also, given how much Rory fan art I see out there - a good chunk from people who haven't seen the show no less - I think it's pretty clear who's the heart of this thing. But in all seriousness, the idea does have potential for exploring the dangers of technological gaps in the same vein that the Tales of Symphonia sequel attempted to do between its wildly different lands, and if Gate had focused on that, I might have been interested. Hell, if there was a scene where one of these cat-eared girls discovers the existence of a flamethrower and tests it out, that would have been cute enough. Instead, we just get military propaganda within the realm of a fantasy setting, and neither side really does much to stand out from the rest of the pack by themselves, let alone with each other.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering I don't like fantasy stories or military stuff, I'm not even sure why I'm still dwelling on Gate. Might as well just wrap things up and go watch something on Netflix. I heard Lady Dynamite is pretty decent, although these post-modern comedies are getting kinda same-y to me.",

            "content": "Story 6/10\r\nFirst season of Gate got me hooked so bad, it got me hyped like bunny on crack. I marked my calendar for the second season and kept checking the release date while having unrealistic hope that it will be released sooner. Then first episode came. I was \"YEEEEAAHHHH THIS IS MY TIME\". Second episode came and I was \"KEEP IT COMING\". Then around fifth or so I was \"the hell??? What is happening right now?\" The plot just got more and more confusing. Scene cuts were so abrupt it felt like it changed scene even though it hadn't finish telling the previous scene. Forexample, \"Look! Lelei, Rory, and Itami are in the middle of fighting. Okay, that's it. Now look at the asshole crown prince sitting there with a dumb face.\" Speaking of! I really hate the crown prince there are no words to describe and will contribute a whole section just to ramble about him. Later.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI just love. Love. Love the vibrant colour it had for everything. The characters, the natures, the buildings, the objects, the animals, just everything! I also really like the character designs. OH and their clothes of course. So...anime-ish I guess lol those clothes that were ridiculous and would never be worn in real life, but absolutely adorable in anime, even in the middle of war (Rory, I'm looking at you).\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I love about Gate is its soundtracks. The opening was just on point this season and the ending was very catchy as well. Sfx were also placed perfectly on scenes and those were another good points of Gate.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10\\n\\n\r\nZolzac. Fucking Zolzac. Need I say more? He was supposed to be the main villain in this series, but I just can't take him seriously. Exhibit A: \"I am the crown prince. Who dares defy me? SDF? Fuck them! I WILL BEAT THEM!\" Then proceeded to get beaten up. After that there was Exhibit B: \"Just you wait SDF. I definitely beat you this time!\" Then proceeded to lose for the second time. After this one there was Exhibit C: \"Fuck you SDF! YOU WILL BOW DOWN TO MY GREATNESS!!!\" Then proceeded to lose AGAIN. Then there was another one, another one after that, and another one after the second one. I would give you more example, but I don't want to bore you, like normal people would get after repetitive scenes. Gate, apparently, don't think that way. Zolzac just sounded stupid after the second time. I mean, I get it if he got a new solid plan and wanted to try again, but he didn't! He just opened his wide ass mouth, screamed for his subordinates, rampaged, complained to Tyule (I'm not sure about the spelling), then sat his ass on the fancy throne. Tyule got more likeable after watching him being stupid and I don't even like her to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nIncidentally, Tyule scene at the end just confused me. I'm not gonna write what it was about. I'm just telling you it didn't even make sense. It was like Gate tried to make watchers (??) more sympathetic towards her, but failed. So hard. The rest of the characters had nothing different from the first season, except for Lelei. She was more badass this season, but that was it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, aside from crappy characters and confusing story line, I say Gate 2nd season was quite enjoyable. It wasn't really comparable to the first season, but it was ok. More like an anime you would watch if you're bored and had nothing important to do. Or when you just wanted to procrastinate lol\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you watched the first season, I think it's a good idea to watch the second season. Just to know the continuation of the story. Go big or go home right?",

            "content": "When it comes to split cour anime, trying to do better than what you established in the first season is usually the biggest issue due to the possibility of the audience comparing what the studio has done before to what they have presented.  Since split cour isn't particularly a good thing due to the fact that they stop in the middle of the story and usually mill around for the last episode of the first season, trying to come back with something better is often times much harder.  So, what exactly did Gate do to try and remedy this solution?\r\nStory: Picking off wherewe left off in season 1, with the JSDF and the kingdom of the other people beyond the Gate, we follow the story of these two sides once again for the prospect of peace and tranquility as politics and war creeps over the horizon.  \\n\\n\r\nRather than following the protagonist, Itami, in his expedition as being sort of the 'prime ambassador' to the people beyond the gate (due to the fact that he has a mini harem sorta following him around), Gate splits itself off to follow a duality of stories.  One concerning the state of the politics and the people on both sides being affected by the welling of politics on both sides, and Itami's what equates to just derping around adventures as he and a small group of his fellow characters from the other realm just...sort of travel around.  \\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the plot this time focuses heavily on the plot related aspects rather than focusing on Itami as a character himself.  While the first season focused on a mix of both Itami and the ongoings of war and peace that were going on, this season sinks itself more into a plot based scenario where the main objective is to handle the different situations that go on in the special region with its main focus being a tyrannical rule that comes from within the royal family itself.  This part of the anime is rather well written and does get into the specifics of the puppet government and general tyrannical rule that the special region slowly starts to be taken under, which brings us a political conflict that makes a lot of sense and was actually interesting to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nThe issues of these political matters is the fact that because of the way the two opposing sides were designed, both in military prowess and most importantly, technology, the plot ended up becoming rather predictable because, well...the very first thing Japan did when crossing over to the Gate was carpet bomb 100k soldiers without a single casualty to their side.  Take a guess who's going to win.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue that the story suffered from was the fact that the entire part that involved Itami and his merry band of travelers was sort of irrelevant.  While their actions did directly influence the plot, none of them were really things that had a grand effect.  More so, just telling the audience that the events on both sides are happening at the same time.  Itami's adventures just felt sort of thrown in there, and I didn't really see much of a point to it on account of how little it was shown in comparison to the messy politics that was going on, and was just a complete change of tone from happy and sometimes silly atmosphere to this gray and dangerous one where the delicate balance of peace could be pushed into war in an instant.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, mostly due to the issue that concerns the obvious gap in power that the JSDF had over the special region, the end didn't really feel all that climactic and everything just sort of fell nicely into place without really any aftereffects or any repercussions that come from war.  Like seriously, this was by far the happiest end to a war that I have ever seen.  And I can't even call it a war due to how easily everything was resolved.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  More plot-based\\n\r\n+  Focused more on the politics that was lacking from S1\\n\r\n-  Splitting the story to have Itami moments took away from the story\\n\r\n-  Obvious gap of power made the plot predictable\\n\r\n-  The end had everything fall into place TOO cleanly\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Due to the fact that the series shifted to more of a plot-based story, the amount of actual character defining moments and development is mostly non-existent and if was present, really had no proper dedication aside from maybe 1-2 minutes to describe backstory of their personal problems.  \\n\\n\r\nItami himself, rather than having the majority of the screentime is more or less absent from this series.  He's still around, dealing damage and kicking ass around the special region with Rory, Lelei, and Tuka to just sort of...explore around.  There's really no character development or any real character moments for him.  Out of these four key characters, the only one who truly gets any time dedicated to her is Tuka, but even then, it's more or less just over the course of one or two characters.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's everyone else.  Practically every other character, including the characters that we met previously in the first season are all more or less bundled up into this one big conglomerate that help move along this plot based format.  There really isn't much time dedicated to each one, and all of them are more or less plot devices to help move the story along.  In this case, it isn't a bad thing, but every character is more or less defined less as an actual person, but more so as a cog in a giant, war-themed machine.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Tuka gets some character development\\n\r\n+ Cast matches the plot-based story\\n\r\n-  No one is really a defined character\\n\\n\r\nArt:  Produced by A-1, Gate S2 has roughly around the same quality that S1 had, which was this very bright and colorful fantasy look that reflected the magical world that the series was portraying.  There really were no faults with the animation quality, as it stayed relatively the same throughout, and A-1's general quality shined through.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The OST on the hand isn't really all that spectacular.  The OP is this rock song that honestly doesn't have much merit to it.  It's actually a rather strange turn in contrast to the heroic sounding OP from the first season which personally left a bad taste in my mouth.  Similarly, the ED is just this generic, happy-go-lucky song that really doesn't do much to add much value to the series.  Overall, the sound isn't really the best part of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Gate was a series that I found to be interesting.  In this season, I liked what they did by focusing more on the politics and the story, while predictable, was still enjoyable to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes, I did.  While it wasn't particularly my favorite of the season, it had a lot more darker moments and war that fantasy or war related anime of this nature don't really get into (Like POWs, civil conflict, coup de dats, raping/enslaving POWs, etc.).  Coupled with a more serious plot that focused more on the fine balance between war and peace, and I found a series that I  was honestly better than I thought it would be considering how little happened in the first season.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I enjoy about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nThe show set itself up for failure trying to establish a war between steel and arrows with guns and explosives.  The show was very predictable and any real tension that happened in the story was rather anticlimatic because there was almost no way that the JSDF would've lost any war that they were involved in.  (Especially given how positively stupid the tyrannical government was set up.  It was destined for failure.)  Also, everything just ended too happily and too conveniently.  It was like your generic 'happily ever after' ending which was just kinda...meh.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked the original Gate S1, then I would recommend this for a watch.  If you haven't seen Gate, if you're interested in politics and war in conjunction with fantasy elements, then I would suggest this anime to you.  The execution has problems, but overall, the show did do a decent job with what it wanted to portray and did it with relative success.",

            "content": "Let me just start off with the fact that I usually see the bright side in an anime series, and hence am usually pretty generous in regards to scoring. With that said, it's no surprise that I view this anime series as one of my favorites. \r\nStory is 8!\r\nGate Season 2 isn't really a new season. It's just a continuation of season 1. The main synopsis in this \"season\" revolve around Itami and crew vs the fire dragon, and the uprising and sudden takeover of the empire by Prince Zorzal. There were more fighting scenes compared to season 1, which was my main issue withthe S1, so  I was pleased. While the story itself is fine, it's the way the story is executed that brings down the score. Throughout the anime, the JSDF and the empire claim to be in a war, and both regard each other as enemies. However, it doesn't really seem to be like a war, but rather something similar to a cold war. There's no true fighting until the near end, whereas in season 1, there was the great battle of Alnus. Even if they are in a war, it just doesn't seem like it.\\n\r\nThe ending of Gate S2 is perfect as well. I won't spoil it, but I will just say the Gate S1 ended on a massive cliffhanger. Nothing was given. With Gate S2, at least there is some sort of closure.\\n\\n\r\nArt is 9!\\n\r\nThe art is the exact same as season 1. If you're like me and really don't pay attention to the art unless it's horribly bad, then the art will please you.\\n\\n\r\nSound is 10!\\n\r\nIf you loved the opening for season 1, then you'll love the opening here! It's by the same artist as the first, with a tad more rock. The closing is sung by the voice actors of Lelei, Rory, and Tuka, just like the first season. In my opinion, this closing is MUCH better than the first. Not as silly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter is 8!\\n\r\nThe series mostly followed Itami and his crew. However, quite a few of the characters in season 1 were put off for the majority of this season to focus on Itami and his party and Zorzal, until the end, when they return and join Itami. While you come to understand and know some of the new characters, there are others who aren't as developed, which makkes sense, as there's such a huge cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you liked Gate S1, you'll love Gate S2. It fulfills the expectation many of us have had ever since it was announced. I can honestly say waiting until only 3 days ago to watch all 11 episodes, plus the last one today, was totally worth it. Here's hoping for Gate S3.",

            "content": "There was this show back in 2014 which managed to make waves due to one notable asset; a red and black gothic lolita wielding an oversized halberd claiming herself to be nearly a millennium old. Obviously with all the time I had back then and especially at the behest of a fellow anime fan, I rode the hype train. Two seasons later, I came back astounded at a different take on the 'other world' (isekai) genre. Then the dub came out recently... so naturally a rewatch is in order. \r\nI'm normally not the rewatching type so I thought to myself, \"Will I still get thesame satisfaction as the first time?\" With the current oversaturation of isekai anime, we've seen everything from grade A waifus and high fantasy, to self-aware parodies and gritty deconstructions. Does GATE offer anything else on the table for the hungry anime enthusiast?\\n\\n\r\nFour years later, my verdict as well as my fondness for GATE hasn't changed. It takes a tired premise and eagerly works with what it has, proving that 'serious' and 'fun' can be used in the same sentence.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 9\\n\\n\r\nUsually when we go to another world, the trip only offers limited seats. Either you're the chosen one to six people temporarily (or permanently) whizzed off to Wonderland for an extended period of time with no way back. Many more can join the fray but ultimately the objective remains the same. How do I get back? How do I survive until then?\\n\\n\r\nGATE gives us... well, an open gate between two worlds. Anyone can get in and out. So what plays out? Curiosity grows to expansion. Expansion explodes into war. And war makes way for attempts at peace. Pretty much human nature in a nutshell. Instead of supernatural hijinks or a grand fantasy adventure, GATE revolves around the interdimensional relations that ensue if a rift existed between Japan and a generic RPG world. For one thing, it isn't any prettier than what history taught us about colonization, showing us that the road to peace is paved with political, economic, and martial turmoil.\\n\\n\r\nWe view the whole gate phenomenon through the eyes of an otaku and closet  army man, Youji Itami. And while the events are a dream come true for him, it soon gets real when the Japanese military is involved. What follows is a series of expeditions by the Japanese Self-Defense Force (JSDF) led by Itami's squad to expand into this so-called \"special region.\"\\n\\n\r\nBefore we drop the bomb and assume the show's going to be another dark ride on the edge of Angstville, it never goes there. Many people will criticize the glorification of the Japanese military, the ego-stroking that comes with an otaku protagonist, and completely forgettable characters compensated by gore, violence, and explosions. I beg to differ.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the premise so interesting is the other world it portrays; a world of knights, princesses, elves, mages, and beastkin. How does such a fairytale setting wage war with the modern world? Scenarios like this often make our military appear obsolete with our clunky helicopers, sluggish tanks, and lackluster guns battling alien weaponry, mysterious powers, and fantastic beasts.\\n\\n\r\nGATE turns this showdown on its head by portraying just how far we've gone in the science of war. While the fantasy world is stuck with shields and swords, bows and arrows, and horsemen and lances, our advances in technology seem to mirror the enigma of magic in their eyes. Imagine staffs that shoot metal with pinpoint accuracy at terrifying speeds from an untouchable distance. And that's just how they they view your basic rifle. Think about the fear our grenades, jets, and artillery strike into their hearts. If there's one thing GATE does well, it's making us feel the sheer shock and awe from the losing side. The juxtaposition just works.\\n\\n\r\nHere we are, appearing like gods of war raining hell after coming from the other side of the gate, when we're really just defending ourselves on what seems like a simple scouting mission. Our fantastic counterparts, on the other hand, wage a full scale attack throwing men by the thousands on horseback flanked by orcs and wyverns despite wielding inefficient spells, arms, and tactics. Sure it just so happens the Japanese military takes full jurisdiction with unrealistic competency, but it serves as a quirky reminder that we take our own strength as a species for granted. We are the very invaders we imagine others outside our world to be.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the militarized twist on isekai and fantasy tropes overall, it delivers an action-heavy plot with wonderfully choreographed sequences. GATE excels in building up grandiose scenes. From depicting the amount of explosives it would take to slay a dragon to demonstrating how potent proper military training really is, GATE knows its premise enough to have fun with it.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the characters taking a backseat in all this merrymaking, the show owes its substance to subtle worldbuilding. For starters, the world beyond the gate itself seems like the average fantasy world. Looking into the history of the mysterious gate, we discover that it turns out to be a randomly occurring portal bridging numerous dimensions. Goblins, kobolds, and dragons coexist with elvenkind, knights, and our kind of humans because the gate has collected them into a pocket dimension. The medieval nature of humans residing here also means that at some point in time, we have wandered here, only to attack ourselves in the future. War never changes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the generic otherworlders, their stereotypes are granted practical application. Most of their actions are even rooted in their species' respective social class. Beastkin (or furries), for instance, are often the bane of fanservice and twisted fetishes. Here, they are akin to marginalized tribesmen, relegated to prostitutes and slaves if not fortunate enough to serve as maids or servants under a royal house. Elves, on the other hand, are a peaceful kind relying on basic magic and hunting skills to survive outside the Empire walls. Meanwhile, Dark Elves, their tanner counterparts, behave more like warriors and templars who suffer discrimination from their intimidating appearance. The education system is also touched on where being a mage and its resulting occupations are also similar to pursuing a degree, given you can prove the sun is the center of our solar system without it sounding like a joke.\\n\\n\r\nSadly though, the anime adapatation is surpassed by its manga and light novel counterparts. Though we only get a brief mention of the aforementioned pantheon of gods and demigods, some lore on the gate's origins, and a glimpse of the fight against rebels of the Empire, we know enough about war and human nature to know where GATE is going. 24 episodes for me are just right before the action fantasy overstays its welcome.\\n\\n\r\nART - 8\\n\\n\r\nWith GATE's high stakes comes high contrast, high color, and high detail. Vivid is the best word for it. Traumatic shell-shock scenes, mass slaughter, political assassinations, and organized coups, all brought to you in warm technicolor. It's like the art is still stuck in its own fantasy despite the dire circumstances. Despite the clear irony with the lively visuals against the violent content, it makes sense given that GATE views war and politics as the daily grind. Nothing is new and dramatic about taking names and taking lives. The day job then becomes more colorful when there's a prospect of a new world ripe for the taking. So in this regard, the blissfully unaware art actually adds a layer of character by viewing it from the eyes of a geek in the army sent to the battlefront of his wildest dreams; enchanted yet unfazed by the fantastic expedition.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing the clever applications of established anime design tropes, GATE applies this to its characters as well. For once we have straightforward designs for the human world. No excessive hair dye, no googly, multicolored eyes, no awesomely impractical costumes, and no gender and age ambiguity, just regular average people with appropriate builds sporting black or brown hair with some even looking slightly alike. \\n\\n\r\nThe exact opposite is then applied to the show's fantastic counterparts. Underappreciated genius right there. The logic behind all of the aforementioned anime tropes suddenly make sense given another dimension that still shares similarities to our own.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, GATE's art has a definite sense of scope. The world of GATE is huge. With thousands of participants in the entirety of the gate dispute, giving due attention to weapons, vehicles, and beasts alike is an outstanding feat. Instead of being mere props and setpieces, all these helicopters, jets, mortars, and tanks are given weight, size, and solid movement. Bigger objects on-screen are also animated in a detailed, cell-shaded look, making them stand out while still keeping to the bright, toony spirit of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe only downside to GATE's smart application of familiar techniques is that they're too familiar. Though clear-cut, attractive, and brimming with life, it doesn't look any more different from your standard fantasy anime. It also doesn't evoke its own style enough to visually set itself apart from other isekai anime at face value... other than the glaring humvee and the JSDF uniforms, of course. I'd argue though that it's exactly because it appears banal which enhances the deconstruction it does on the \"portal to a fantasy world\" scenario.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also one clever bit of scene transition GATE is fond of. With most sequences building up to the real action consisting of setting, dialogue, and plotting, GATE transitions between different people and points of interest through quick scene cuts akin to comic book panels. Not only does it keep scenes brief and direct, but it also maintains movement and intensity during the slower paced scenes.\\n\\n\r\nWhether it would be a cunning re-envisioning of its genre or to make it an accessible entry for today's anime standards, the art and animation of GATE is a prime example of how to establish an immersive world of size and diversity.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9\\n\\n\r\nWith how well the show is faring so far in this review, I won't be stopping anytime soon. GATE's sound sits just right; composed of awesome SFX, fitting BGM, and a stellar dub teetering between anime fun and Hollywood urgency.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects are abundant especially with the numerous distinct-sounding weapons in Japan's arsenal. Mortar fire, sidearm sounds, and minigun rattles to name a few, give everything that added level of dread and excitement.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the BGM isn't too over the top to draw away from the show itself while still adding to the mood of any scene that demands it. Orchestras dominate the soundtrack that complement the faux-medieval, war-driven setting. It can sound tense one moment, grand in the next. While the OPs for both seasons scream 'mainstream hype' as do the more boppy EDs, they nevertheless do their job and fit the casual undertones of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub, being one of the main reasons why I picked up this show again, definitely did not disappoint. David Wald gives Youji Itami the right blend of gruff and dorky key to his character. There are also notable mentions in his squad. Stephanie Wittels transforms Kuribayashi into an aggressive warfreak as opposed to her genki girl persona. And there's Tomita played by Ty Mahany, coming out as the gentle giant foil to the former. Allison Sumrall grants Kurokawa a motherly touch while Tyler Galindo's Kurata has a spot-on rookie voice as opposed to Josh Morrison's Kuwahara acting as the seasoned veteran. All these performances working with the military-apt script changes in the dub culminates in a truly entertaining army-centric experience.\\n\\n\r\nLet's not forget the leading ladies beyond the gate. Tuuka by Juliet Simmons plays the daddy's girl very well with a voice that just cries innocence. Molly Searcy's Rori, on the other hand, gives an appropriate range for her appearance but with a delivery that completely smashes the illusion of her youth, not afraid to reach cougar levels of intimacy. Brittney Karbowski's Lelei balances out the two with an eerie calmness both warm and devoid of emotion; a job she does masterfully despite her usual ditzy roles. Lastly, Princess Pina Co Lada by Jessica Boone plays her role of forthright successor with such passion and grit that it draws away from her randomly comical name.\\n\\n\r\nThe only fault to be found is the clunky way of presenting language in the gateworld. With gateworlders already speaking our language for the viewer's convenience, we only get glimpses of their native tongue during initial efforts at establishing contact. It slightly detracts from the immersion a fully developed language system could achieve, but I digress. GATE's sound department is nonetheless a grand effort that consistently makes a scene.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 7\\n\\n\r\nI admit GATE's characters aren't the most fleshed out bunch out there. But despite characterization giving in to more focus on the plot, each character isn't wasted.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned earlier that GATE is a show of scale. With a full-blown war on their hands, the cast is as large as it is functional. The main protagonists could be Itami's underdog squad with enough elements to make an A Team. It could also be the waifus on the other plane of existence with how main character-ish they look. But remember we're talking about a show of scale. With assaults, assassinations, courtroom decisions, negotiations, and peace talks happening left and right, there is no one person steering the plot. There's the Empire, the nomads, the military, the government, the media, China, and the US, trying their best to further their own goals. Even Japan is a fearsome and formidable character as demonstrated by their sheer might and edge on and off the battlefield.\\n\\n\r\nBut looking into the characters, as flat as their stereotypes make them out to be, there's still an underlying duality in all of them. Youji Itami, overglorified otaku yet a MacGuyver working a life-threatening job to fund his hobbies. Tuuka, most ladylike in appearance yet a traumatized war child searching for a father figure. Rori the Reaper, epitome of a cosplaying goth-loli gag yet a weary soul-searcher enjoying her last few years of existence. Lelei, quiet and stoic student yet a low-key ambitious prodigy and innovator. Pina Co Lada, a refreshing cocktail by name, yet a badass princess who would do anything for the glory and well-being of the Empire. And don't get me started with the dragons. These standard fantasy minibosses whose only gimmick was flight and fire become nothing short of superweapons in GATE; gigantic creatures that rival jets in maneuverability, tanks in armor, and guns with an endless supply of literal firepower, capable of incinerating fully-armed settlements as well as wiping out entire species off the map. Exactly what dragons are and what they deserve to be.\\n\\n\r\nBottom-line, with a show like GATE, action is character. It's about the collective actions these characters do in the greater scheme of things, communicating time spent on exposition, backstory and needless infodump into an efficient and enjoyable scene.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\\n\r\nWith all of my objective statements earlier, GATE is far from a masterpiece. It isn't that deep, reeks of stereotypes, oversimplifies foreign affairs, and doesn't give us the full story (yet). Despite these glaring shortcomings and its unwavering seriousness in what could've been another isekai, GATE manages to avert them simply by being fun.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it shows no reprieve in hiding the atrocities of war, it does so in such a fantastic and epic scale, inciting more thrill than tragedy; making the awful awesome, and the terrible terrific. Almost like a sky of fireworks or the latest Marvel movie, serious fun is the name of the game.\\n\\n\r\nAdult fears also pop up to keep things refreshing. Maintaining an otaku lifestyle into your 30s, career ethics, media manipulations, incompetent bosses, etc. Itami and company have the most action and screentime sure, but plot movement is ultimately decided by the upper brass, with the pacing purposefully being either too fast or decisively slow. You know that one glaringly obvious thing to do at work your boss just can't let you do until you show him a million reasons worth of paperwork on why it should be done? Get ready to feel that again in GATE.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, you have an escort mission cleverly disguised as a hot spring episode, a volatile civil war quelled by a lolicon pairing, and a bunny girl tribe leader playing Mata Hari as her ultimate vengeance against the empire. The outlandish premises on paper just click in GATE giving generic tropes the extra layer it needs to enthrall viewers once again. With a potential war of the worlds plot acted out by your every-anime characters that blend political drama and battlefield strategy consistently, it strikes the perfect middle ground among analytical viewers, thrill-seekers, and popcorn-eaters. And with all try-hard attempts at being dark, recycled jabs at comedy, and half-baked efforts in fantasy worldbuilding present in any given medium, there are shows like GATE. Shows that don't care about the expectations set by bigger players on the industry, but rather focus on milking every ounce of fun out of its materal for what its worth. Yes it has guns, girls, dragons, and explosions... and it's proud of them. If Michael Bay ever made a fantasy anime, look no further.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 9",

            "content": "GATE has a MAJOR problem with subtlety. And by problem I mean subtlety to GATE means mowing your enemies down with machineguns instead of bazookas.\r\nFrom the outside, this show looks like it hits all the right points. Big action scenes, large fantasy world adventure, political intrigue, moral issues like slavery, and so on. Oh also elf girls.\r\nThe thing it lacks though, is subtlety. This manifests itself in several ways. The action scenes, even though they're filled with raining bullets and mortars, generally have no sense of tension or suspense involved. Mostly because only one side has the bullets. While it makes sense that a modernarmy would easily beat a medieval one, are we supposed to believe that these pseudo-medieval armies have never heard of strategy or using the terrain to their advantage? Once you see that fighting people in the open is a bad idea, draw them into woodlands or forests where close-quarters combat becomes more important. \\n\\n\r\nBut we all know the JSDF is going to win because they're perfect and can do no wrong. Which leads into to the problem of blind nationalism espoused by the anime. The Self Defense Force is blameless and everything is the media's fault, the politicians' fault, the civilian population's fault, etc etc. \\n\\n\r\nNow I can understand that an anime can contain some nationalism, in fact it's probably so abrasive and noticeable because I'm not used to the propaganda of other countries. However, I can still be critical of it because it adds next to nothing to the show and detracts from it greatly. If the show creators had been able to adopt a more nuanced position, showcasing the moral ambiguities in all parties involved, GATE could've easily become one of the best animes of the year.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, almost all the major moral themes in the anime are treated with heavy-handedness and are painted over in either black or white, never shades of grey.\\n\\n\r\nGATE becomes a little boring and tedious to get through after a while. I applaud the attempt at political intrigue they introduced but ultimately it was half-baked, it wasn't very gripping or suspenseful, something that political drama needs to do well to be successful. The consequences of the actions of major characters are often glossed over. Additionally while corruption is portrayed as rampant in the political sphere, somehow the military is squeaky clean? There were great opportunities to introduce some ulterior motives within the upper levels of the military hierarchy, but ultimately those chances were squandered. \\n\\n\r\nGATE was a wasted opportunity. With a tiny bit of subtlety in the writing and directing of the show, a masterpiece would've been within reach. The scope of the anime was perfect to showcase major themes and invoke raw emotion but it was all wasted for what turned out to be an utterly mediocre anime. I give it a 5 or 6 out of 10 because even after all that, it's still not a totally horrible watch. There are entertaining moments, though the anime failed to produce any significant impact for me.",

            "content": "The Second Season of GATE was almost as good as the first one, but I felt that it lags a little bit, because of an overarching problem: The JSDF is just too strong.  With the first season, the anime was better because you were getting acclimated and exposed to the world.  It was interesting to see the dynamics of a modern military fight an ancient one.  It was also intriguing to watch the different cultures clash and learn about one another.   But, in the second season, things have to ramp up and bring serious conflict, and GATE tried to dothat.  However, I feel that where this season lacked, is that the JSDF remained incredibly overpowered.  Even without the JSDF, Rory and LeLei are so overpowered, that nothing can stand in the heroes\u2019 way.  The second season really needed to provide a significant threat to the main heroes.  But, because the heroes were so strong, they had to focus more on threats to tertiary characters like Pina Co Lada, Her knights and random Senate members.   \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, one can argue that the only reason the later half of this season had any friction at all is because the writers had to come up with ways to keep the JSDF and the heroes from just going in and wiping out their problems directly, which they could have easily done.  It felt sort of like how anime creators create an OP character and then have to come up with reasons to keep that OP character from fighting because once they start, the battle is quickly decided.  So most of the combat is done by secondary combatants.   GATE had that issue badly.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, even though it had this problem, it still managed to be entertaining and engaging, even though it left me with the overall feeling of: \"Japan could end all this at any time.\".  The series as a whole had some really remarkable moments as well.  The cast was very likeable, even down to the secondary characters, which is why this anime remained enjoyable even if in the second half, the heroes were pretty much just traveling from place to place for reasons I won't spoil.   Characters like Shelly, Bozes, Pina Co Lada and Beefeater kept the story moving forward.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, GATE is enjoyable and an anime I would recommend watching.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n",

With great characters and interesting ideas (like the main character being otaku). I saw potential in this series and I was having fun. \r\nBut as I continued watching the anime I began to get borred and it wasn't so much fun any more. I even left it and began watching other animes. \r\nI must say that the characters aren't so bad, the art is very good and some times isfun to watch. The main problem I see is the story itself, it is a story that entertains for some time but as time passes you get bored.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say to you to not watch this series if you are looking for a \"meanwhile anime\" or \"until I find a greater anime series\" In fact, if you are looking for that type of anime this series is perfect. But if you are looking for a great story, with well done characters and with excellent quality I wouldn't recommend it to you.\\n\\n",

I mean itomi played no major part in any of the state affairs but was having his own little adventures with his own version of charlies angels. I'm sure some of you enjoyed that very much and to be honest i did too especially thefire dragon part not so much the rondel arc which in my opinion was a big waste of time and did nothing expect reveal that all three girls had a thing for Itomi (Surprise not like this was a harem anime right?).Even though this is a harem anime the romance in it was very low key and nonexistent expect for sagawara, not sure how i feel about that one.The other beta character pairings were just stupid or had no development at all but that is the only thing i disliked about episode 12 which i have to say was a satisfying end to a somewhat boring lead up. I mean sure episode 11 was the more flashy episode but it was episode 12 that had the spirit of the first half of the series with itomi's squad assembling to take on another of their captains stupid whims. No much character development to speak of except for maybe that weird way they introduced the main villain.Who i will curse for the next three weeks or so Zorzal was also pretty villainous but also pretty pathetic. I really hope there will be a season 3 for this.",

            "content": "*FREE SPOILERS*\r\nGATE: Jietai Kanochi nite, Kaku Tatakaeri 2nd Season could have been better than it was. The first season raised an interesting argument: the crash between the society from 21st century and a fantasy world. However, in this second season, this argument could not be the main story line, they had to create new arches. And that new stories are boring and predictable. Let's analyze it by point.\r\nStory (4/10):\r\nThe story is very predictable from start to finish and argumental arches are not at all groundbreaking. Worst of all is to see how each thing that the \"good characters\" do always works perfectly well leaving zerotension to a plot that is not very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nI do not really get into animation, but as I consider it decent and there has not been a moment when my eyes bleed, it's quite acceptable. Also, the soundtrack is nothing incredible although the opening is quite good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nLet's face it, if I put a 5 is for Rory Mercury. It's the only character that seems to me half interesting. I really do not understand how there are people who can draw attention to a blonde elf or a short mage. They are very cliche and very flat. And to top it off, the new characters of this season are not very different from that model, nor even the main antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, overall (5/10):\\n\\n\r\nDespite that, GATE: 2nd Season is not bad to hang out as long as you do not go looking for a serious anime and you really do not claim to be much more than what you presented in your first season.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all folks, \\n\r\nKenel",

With the characters split up, the story is forced to swap between the dastardly machinations of the villains, the politics of peacemaking, internal power struggles, and trying to keep tabs on the lives of the main characters. This confuses the story's sense of direction and makes me question what the focus of the show is. The characters are prominent in the opening and ending but the episodes show very little of their faces. What am I suppose to take away from this show?\r\nArt and sound are the same. Same studio with similar productionvalues.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters either got the go ahead development signal or they didn't. The lucky few were the given screen time required to add growth and viewer interest to themselves. The remaining characters were overlooked in a glorified background character kind of way. It felt like these people might have had something important to do in the books which didn't quite make the anime cut. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy the second season as much. I was hoping that the story and characters would improve from the first season, but this didn't happen on a big enough scale to matter. \\n\\n\r\nOverall its not an accomplished sequel.

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Gate season 1 and season 2. I enjoyed this anime as a whole. The experience was for the most part relaxing and enjoyable as they implemented in fantasy elements, comedy, and even hints of romance. That being said, the second season ramps up its more serious nature, and turns the more fun and fantasy based story into something somewhat less pleasant IMO.\r\nThe story is simple enough. A gate opens in Japan and a medieval era army appears and raids this new world. In response to this attack the JSDF is sent to secure the area beyond thegate and protect from further attack. While on the other side they find this fantasy world with varying cultures and ideas. Many episodes are dedicated to learning more about this world and working their way into signing a peace treaty with \"The Empire\" which is for the most part a centralized government for most of the people in this new world.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was really nice and very pretty. The soundtrack was pretty good and the voice acting was on point.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part this is a harem like anime. We have our otaku super soldier character(Itami, Youji) who is very likable. Then we have a Goth Loli demigod(Mercury, Rory) who was enjoyable and added a bit of fan service to the show. Then we have our emotionless genius magic girl(Lalena, Lelei la) who was mostly there to speed along the blurring of cultures and language barriers. Finally we have a blonde elf (Marceau, Tuka Luna), I don't have much to say about her honestly.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many more characters to mention but I wont list them all. The characters of this show have very strong personality points. This however makes it odd to see some characters have fluctuating personalities. Some of the Empire royalty like the Emperor, the sneaky and intelligent prince and the Empire loving princess all go through on remarked upon times of flux. It felt as if the writers were made to write a certain ending and had to fix a few things to make it work. Overall however the characters were very enjoyable and for the first season I didn't have much of a problem. The second season made me cringe a few times.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I want to say again that I enjoyed this anime. The second season left me with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth as it opened up more side stories to not be finished, and left me with questions regarding the situation between the Empire and Japan. Overall it was entertaining but the backbone of this story was a little flimsy. The conflict which takes both seasons to come to a fuzzy end was lacking and it constantly made me take a step back and not enjoy the anime for a few minutes at a time. However if you like comedy, fantasy, harems, and various other elements along those line, then you should give this a try.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR:\\n\r\n    Not bad time waster. Season 1 was good, season 2 wasn't as good. Give it a watch if you like fantasy themes, harems with no conclusion, or some comedy. There is hardly any fan service, not sure why people are calling this show out on that.\\n",

            "content": "Warning to anyone looking to watch this: This season contains rape, in fact it's one of the opening scenes. If you are triggered by that then be advised.\r\nSo this season is quite a bit darker than the first season. While the rape scenes are fairly well handled (in the first few eps at least), it does immediately take away from the comedy that I really enjoyed in the first season. That's not to say there were no comedic episodes, but they either felt out of place or weren't well done or both and I don't think I laughed once as opposed to the many, manytimes I did so in season 1. So those expecting more of what we got in season one will be dissapointed since, once the dragon plot from season 1 is resolved (in a way that was wholly unsatisfying anyway), the show loses its pacing, introduing waay too many new characters and muddling the plot. The first few eps were fairly solid if dark. Some elements were actually pretty damn good. But after episode five things go more and more down hill. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing, tone and character development take a hit, and while it was never boring, and there were a few clever twists I didn't see coming, I did not enjoy myself like I did the first season, in fact I regret watching beyond episode five. (no wait, I regret watching period).\\n\\n\r\nSo art: Still pretty solid, plenty of rich backgrounds, and diverse background charavters. The animation while, not quite a popping as in season one, was still very good. So yeah if I was rating solely on art and animation this'd get a much higher grade.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I didn't care for the opening, but the bg ost was carried over from season 1. Of course later episodes had more than one instace where it was used terribly and there was a complete tonal dissonence between the music and what was playing out on screen. The voice acting (Japanese version) was solid, like the first.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Here's where things start to go down hill. Development is rushed, and after ep five they stop even trying. The female characters slowly lose most of what made them likable and become the typical, shallow harem sterotypes obssesed with the same guy. Or become damsels to be rescued. While some of the new characters have their moments, those are fleeting and lack impact as the show fails to keep tone and opts to scrap development whenver it's convenient for the plot. I'm sad because I ended up disliking most of the character that I liked in season 1. :(\\n\\n\r\nStory: Missed opportunities, over reliance on coincidences, unfunny and out of place comic relief scenes that are much more mean spirited than in season 1 and generally serve to degrade the main characters. Too many contrived plot twists, to many gross and disturbing scenes (I really did NOT need to see a goblin pig monster satisfy his fetish of licking and bunny girl's leg in the grossest way), to rushed, to unfocused, too many new characters, too many side plots. Just gah this season ruined everything season one had going for it. D:\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict: SKIP IT! seriously save your sanity and pretend it ended with season 1.\\n\\n\\n",
