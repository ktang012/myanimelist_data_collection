            "content": "Every once in a while you\u2019ll come across an anime that\u2019ll literally help you grow as a person, help you understand some things you may have misunderstood, and when you do come across such anime you hold it in such a high regard that nothing else can even come close, and, on top of that, you begin believing anime to be the best entertainment medium there is.\r\nThen, unfortunately, you come across an anime so terrible, so bad, so devoid of any worth, that you want to quit it altogether, fly to Japan and kill anyone even remotely connected to the world of anime. Such isthe case with Sky Wizards. Welcome to a large, steaming pile of crap with literally only 1 decent thing in it: girls are kind of cute. No, seriously, that\u2019s literally the only reason I gave this thing 2 instead of 1. I bet that if you wanted to, you could write seminars depicting just how bad this thing is. You could teach young people, not just writers or directors, how NOT to live LIFE just based off on this anime. It packs so much \u2018bad\u2019, that if unleashed, it would corrupt the entire world and make everyone next gen Hitler. And, what\u2019s so bad about it you wonder? Well, I already said. Everything. \\n\\n\r\nStory is an incoherent mess. Plots get introduced out of nowhere, some are never resolved, there\u2019s no underlying, or rather \u2018main plot\u2019 whatsoever, there is 0 world building, and nothing of even remote interest occurs. Story is just a huge, steaming pile of mess. Even if I wanted to, there is literally nothing to spoil. No, I\u2019m not joking. You watch the 1st episode, and you KNOW how it\u2019s going to end. There\u2019s 0 debate there. Whatever underlying themes you think exist in this anime, you are wrong. And no, it\u2019s not my opinion, it\u2019s a fact. What underlying theme? Of growth? Overcoming your weakness? Suddenly becoming the most OP trio in the history of academy just by becoming \u2018better friends\u2019? Don\u2019t judge book by its cover?  If I were born a dumpster by any chance, and someone tried to throw away DVD\u2019s of this anime, I\u2019d throw them right back out. Is there some epic plot that spans the worlds? Nope. There\u2019s nothing epic about it. The entire thing occurs in a small city in the sky. Well then, for sure, that city must have gotten some major world building, seeing as it\u2019s the only place seen throughout the anime. Nope. I couldn\u2019t even bother remembering the name of the city. Nothing is given relation to something else. You don\u2019t know who lives here, you don\u2019t know what happens here, and you\u2019re not even sure just how big the city is. Well then, for sure, seeing as how condensed the story and world is, it must have some mysterious, heart-throbbing plots that eventually lead to a satisfying conclusion! Nope. There\u2019s nothing mysterious, heart-throbbing within this anime, and trust me when I say that the \u2018conclusion\u2019 is EVERYTHING but satisfying. I could write a book on just how terribly this show is written, but it\u2019d be a waste. Exposition is given abruptly, at random times, and even when we get it, they still don\u2019t explain anything. Who the hell are these bugs? Who controls them? Why are they attacking humans in the sky cities? Why are the human lives so important for them? How come some of them are bigger than others? Are they intelligent? Why can one of them speak? Is there the big bad guy somewhere controlling them all? How are they in such huge numbers when you show our characters kill literally thousands of them at time? How come some people can use magic and some don\u2019t? When did we evolve to the point of being able to use magic? Where did the magic come from? How are we even using it? Who created weapons that are catalyst of magic usage? Are they a necessity or just a helping tool? How come everyone is able to learn whatever everyone else is able to learn? Is there a set number of magic available and you just use whatever fits you? You wanna know? Yeah, well, too bad. You won\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\nArt, sound, animation \u2026 honestly, I can oftentimes overlook this \u2013 and I do. If the show is gripping in any other department, I\u2019ll simply overlook it and say \u2018well, their budget was limited and they did the best they could with what they had\u2019. But in the case of this thing, I can\u2019t. Art is as generic as anything you\u2019ve ever seen. Nothing sticks out. No character design, no building, no creature \u2013 everything is just \u2026 boring. And now the animation \u2026 oh sweet Satan I offer thee my soul to save me. When animators can\u2019t be bothered to animate a character LITERALLY just floating left and right, and instead use jump cuts of said character at left, middle and right, and dare REPEAT it 3 times, you know no one wanted to do anything with this thing. Calling animation stiff would be insult to every other anime with stiff animation. When things are animated, they\u2019re animated in such low framerate you just wish they didn\u2019t even bother animating it. Battles? What?! What the hell was that? I get more excitement from watching bonefire burn out than this thing. Throughout the entire show, you\u2019ll see STILL people flying through the air, swinging things in, and I swear, like 5 frames per second (it can probably cause heart attacks to faint hearted), seeing generic things shoot generic, dull-colored things, and the other things firing slightly bigger, differently colored generic things. There\u2019s no excitement. There is no battle in this anime you\u2019ll even remotely remember \u2013 no, not even \u201cthe final showdown\u201d. Nothing. Sound is just another thing where the generic side of this anime just shows its ugly head, and it shows it with pride. Same theme is repeated over and over again, at times even louder than anything else happening, as if creators were actually proud of it. Voice actors are \u2026 dull. They don\u2019t bring life to the characters \u2013 and, when they try to, they fail. I swear, Senyuu. had better art, animation, sound, story and characters. Let that sink in. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters \u2026 oh boy. I\u2019m not gonna even bother listing their names and will call them by their most defined trait: hair color. \\n\\n\r\nYou have red-haired girl; she\u2019s your generic semi-tsundere who wants to grow stronger and grows feelings for our MC despite treating him like crap generally. Development? Nope. Interesting dialogue, quirks, banters? Haha, good one. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have blonde-haired girl; she\u2019s your generic shy, tense, unable to look people in the eye type of a girl. She also, obviously, quickly grows attached to our MC and trusts him nigh unquestionably. Development? Haha \u2026 hahah \u2026 \\n\\n\r\nThen we have our blue-black-whatever-colored girl; she\u2019s your generic \u2018I\u2019m a goddess, treat me as such\u2019 character who never fails to annoy the crap out of you. She, of course, also grows attached to our MC, and her supposed \u2018issues\u2019 get addressed 2 times in one episode (well, rather than \u2018addressed\u2019, it\u2019s just shown she has them; they\u2019re never actually \u2018addressed\u2019). Development? Man, you never learn, do you? \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of our MC. He\u2019s your generic look-at-me, pump-up, all-thee-mighty character with questionable but working methods of improving people\u2019s skill by simply showing them following:\\n\\n\r\n1.\t1 special move\\n\r\n2.\tBecome friends\\n\r\n3.\tWork together\\n\\n\r\nSo, all of you out there \u2013 all of you who participate in sports or any kind of group activity, those 3 things above are ALL you need to become the very best, even though you were literally the worst like 1 month before. Hard work? Why? Sweating blood and tears for years and years in order to even slightly improve? Why? You can just become friends and boom, you can wipe everyone out. \\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019ve seen his character time and time again. He\u2019s your generic \u2018Oh, everyone treats me like crap but I\u2019m actually a nice guy\u2019, and he never deviates from that. In the first episode, he\u2019s shown to be blown up by an overwhelming attack (I\u2019m using that word quite loosely by the way), and I just assumed he was dead. But nope, he lived. How? Ah, who gives a crap! Look at just how cool he is instead! \\n\\n\r\nThere are also some other characters out there, each as generic as you can possibly come to generic: random psycho who falls in love with a girl and wants to kill everyone to prove something, tsundere girl in love with our MC but constantly throwing spiteful things at him, supporting duo of friends you know nothing about that pop up once in awhile just to tell audience that our MC isn\u2019t as bad as everyone is calling him, and so on and so forth. \\n\\n\r\nBeing completely blunt here: this is, quite possibly, one of the worst anime ever created \u2013 hear me out here, okay? Yeah, there are other anime out that are just as terrible, just as painful. But, when it comes to them, you can just laugh at how bad they are. You can point at something and say \u2018That doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s just terrible\u2019. Here? There is no pleasure from doing that. You\u2019re just reincorporating the idea that you actually DEVOTED THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE to watch this. Not only is it generic on every single fathomable level, it goes beyond that. It makes generic look masterpiece-like. If you ever felt you underappreciated certain anime, watch this. You\u2019ll not only appreciate said anime more, but you\u2019ll also begin appreciating your life and your time. \\n\\n\r\nIn case you hadn\u2019t noticed, no, I didn\u2019t enjoy this anime, not even the slightest bit. There\u2019s nothing clever about it, and even when the exposition inevitably hits, it explains nothing (making you wonder why was it there in the first place). Stay away from this, you\u2019ll have nightmares.",

            "content": "Back in Spring 2015, when I was looking for potential animes to watch. Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan caught my eye. I read the synopsis. It was as follows:\r\nThe story is set in a world where humanity, driven off the land by the threat of magical armored insects, now live in aerial floating cities. Thus wizards \u2014 aerial combat mages who fight the insects with magical powers \u2014 came into being.\r\nKanata Age (Eiji) is a young man who lives on the floating wizard academy city of \"Misutogan.\" He was once celebrated as the \"Black Master Swordsman,\" the elite ace of the S128 special team. However,he is now despised as the \"traitor of the special team.\"\\n\\n\r\nI thought to myself, this sure sounds it could potentially be the top contender for the Summer 2015 anime season. \\n\\n\r\nI could not be more wrong. This is probably the worst anime of 2015 and one of the worst anime I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nThis is exactly how I finished watching the series:\\n\r\n1. Hmm, the girls are somewhat cute. \\n\r\n2. Why am I still watching this? Nvm, it's just a 12 episode series. And I still need to know why he called a traitor. \\n\r\n3. Holy shit, this anime is freaking terrible.\\n\r\n4. That's the end? It's over? Wait... What was the whole show about again?\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10 (I would give a 0 if I could.) \\n\\n\r\nWhat plot? What story? Who needs that when you are watching this crap!? Awesome fights with beetles!? None of that sort! Just forget about what you read in the synopsis!! No explanations or backstory to the beetles or its origin. Everything is in a mess here. I could try to spoil you but I can't, since there is no plot at all!! But, I will try anyways!!\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1: Generic Introduction!\\n\r\nEpisode 2 - 5: We need to train! Let's spend the next 4 episodes training for the match! \\n\r\nEpisode 6: HA! You don't even get to see the match they spent 4 episodes training for.\\n\r\nEpisode 7 - 11: Let's train! \\n\r\nEpisode 12: Fight scenes so amazing, I rather watch Goku charge up his Spirit bomb. This is how it went for the final showdown. Float left, float right, still images, more still images. Boom, it's over.\\n\\n\r\nThere, I spoilt it for you! Ha!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2/10 \\n\r\nThe only redeeming factor, girls are somewhat cute. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 0/10 (I don't care anymore. I don't care if the lowest score I can give is 1/10, because it deserves a 0.) \\n\\n\r\nThe worst action/battle I've seen EVER in anime history. I get more excited watching 2 still images hitting each other (Even Pokemon Battle animation in Pokemon Yellow in Gameboy colour is more interesting than this crap!!) I rather watch Goku charge up his spirit bomb and go AHHHHHH for 3 episodes. Stickman animations have 100x better fight scenes than what you will get here. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 2/10\\n\r\nNothing special to talk about. Gets a 2 because the op is not bad to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nThere wasn't any character development other than Misora but even then it was cringy and uninteresting.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nTo be honest, the first episode started off pretty decently for me. It got me interested. Then everything went to hell real fast from there onwards and you spend the remaining of your time wondering why the heck am I still watching this. The reason why this is a 2 is because I enjoyed wondering how bad an anime can get and was amused at how bad this anime is, it made me appreciate every other anime out there. \\n\\n\r\nOn behalf of everyone who managed finish this series, only 2 things kept us going: \\n\r\n1. Girls are cute.\\n\r\n2. WHY IS HE A TRAITOR!? STOP CALLING HIM A TRAITOR!! JUST TELL ME ALREADY. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst anime of 2015 by far, and one of the worst anime I've seen. Absolutely disgusting.\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10 (Literally given a 2 because the girls are cute.)",

            "content": "MY First Serious Review ! The review doesn't contain spoilers\r\nPeople say that the anime industry is going down. Well, that's completely wrong. What's going down is the quality of the anime. Unique plots is something rare to see in modern day anime. \r\nStory 4/10\r\nOne of the worst parts in the anime. The setting is in a fantasy world where magic exists. Yeah, you probably heard that in most synopsis of new anime. There's probably nothing special about the plot. Fanservice is there and in an excessive amount that makes this series unwatchable. This anime is probably going to the harem route but it's just aprobability because it doesn't focus on romance \\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10\\n\r\nI will be blunt about this, the art was mediocre if not crappy. You probably saw the character designs in another anime, especially the red haired tsundere. The fighting scenes were terrible and slow.\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\r\nNothing special in the sound department. The OP and ED are plain and normal.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10\\n\r\nI consider this part of the anime the worst. You just need one word to describe it, cliche. The protagonist is your OP main character, but I consider him the second best character. The first one is of course the Ice Cream guy. You have the Tsundere, red-haired feamle, the shy one and the narcissist one. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\r\nI'm really picky about the anime I watch. I try to avoid an anime that is about magic and contains a lot of fanservice. I tried to give this anime a chance but it was what I expected.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\r\nThis isn't the worst anime of the season. You probably would enjoy it if you didn't care about the plot and fanservice, but if you did, you'll probably drop it. Have a good day MAL community\\n",

            "content": "\"Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan\" or \"Sky Wizards Academy\" is one of those cliche animes with a cool main character, in this case Kanata, who just seems to meet girls in a weird situation and is inevitably forced to work together with them towards a similar goal. \r\nLike said, the story resolves around Kanata Age, a traitor as everyone calls him, who is assigned as the instructor of team E601 to win the Sky Wizards tournament in order for them to not be disbanded. What's the catch? The team is utterly useless, having suffered 10 losses in a row. With an incredibly shy girl Lecty,a self-taught \"goddess\" Rico and a leader who can't really lead Misora, what is gonna happen? Well, find out yourself.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise, as most of the action/drama animes, it lacks. Work towards goal, not working out, gradually working out, big bad guy, defeat big bad guy, good end. There wasn't any real emotional attachment given to the characters, so if someone died, you wouldn't have really felt anything. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the artwork. I can't really complain. I enjoyed the artstyle used and fancied the backgrounds. Characters were nicely made. I really took a liking to a few of the characters for the looks, but that was as much of a liking as you can get in this.\\n\\n\r\nSoundwise it's not bad, but it's not overly good. The voices were okay.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. I typically enjoy these shows just for the comedy and action, since you can't usually feel the drama. What brough the enjoyment of this one down were the action scenes. They were literally so boring I went into the kitchen to make a sandwich just to not watch them. Another good example of this would Seiken Tsukai no World Break. There wasn't any real emotion behind any of the fighting. I can still say I enjoyed it, but it could've been a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nIf it's so cliche and bad, why are you rating this a whole 8 out of 10? \\n\r\nWell, I am a sucker for anime such as this one.",

            "content": "(Know that this is only about the anime and not the light novel) After seeing all the reviews and it being recced on my anime page I had to see it and I expected it to not be to my liking, now honestly I'm more disappointed with it. I do like this anime and I think it could have been good if it wasn't thanks to possibly multiple things like not having enough episodes to flush things out that needed it or they were banking on people going to some manga or novel source where it comes from to get the money. Whatever it wasit I don't know, but this anime was something I know could have been better if handled right all the way through.\\n\\n\r\n1. The story - I think people only saw this as a harem sort of anime, probably because of the cliches showing on top, but when I watched this it's not really and the only ones who showed interest in the MC like that was Misora and Yuri who outright loved the guy. \\n\r\nThis is actually an underdog story like the movies some of us grew up with let's see if you can see the tropes: 1. There's a bunch of misfits with personal problems in an area that they are outclassed in by others around them and no one believes in them. 2. A badass top tier that has been shamed by his soon to be justified actions becomes their teacher due to circumstances. 3. They have a rocky meet. 4. They train in their interest sucking at first and in their personal lives to overcome their own inner weaknesses. 5. They are challenged by the higher than them antagonist the whole way. 6. In the first official competition they get into they lose. 7. After a bit more training, the team is ACTUALLY ready for the upcoming tournament. 8. They win in the next one and rise through the ranks in montage and then their main antagonist opponents are last to overcome and they win. \\n\r\nDoes this NOT sound familiar to you now? Do you SEE what I'm talking about now? That's what this actually is no matter what anyone but me tells ya  because I pretty much summed this whole thing up beat for beat and since I like this kind of story I think it's good.\\n\\n\r\n2. The art - The art is ok, it's nothing stellar, nothing you really say is the best thing about it though I give them some credit on their use of CGI on the monster enemy from hell, it's no Fate Stay Night nor is it Rakuen Tsuihou. It's right on the average middle that's good for anime. Special note on the way they die, it is glorious to see I recommend looking at the opening episode just to see how that it. The people's anime is anime hair, faces are faces, the things I like most though is the weapons which are, like RWBY and unlike it, are to the owners design and interesting to look at, but they aren't also a gun.\\n\\n\r\n3. The sound - In terms of VAs it's all around fine, the background music is pretty MMORPG-like, boom when action is there, light and flutes and violins all around when there's character time. It's pretty ok.\\n\\n\r\n4. The character - The characters are of their own trope and cliches: Kanata Age: He used to be the best, but thanks to things happening he's now known as a traitor. So to redeem himself, he has to make the worst team of Sky Wizards in terms of grades and skills a skilled and powerful one. Despite being marked a traitor, Kanata works earnestly to help out his girls and as a teacher fitting a trope he is a good one. He has an annoying habit though in that he forgets to mention crucial stuff to people before it actually happens.\\n\\n\r\nMisora Whitail, she's the tsundere and after a very harem-like meeting with Kanata the two are off to bad start, but don't let that fool you. While her character may look simplistic or unattractive for some, the reason she fights and her dreams are what makes her genuine. Living with her Muggle dad and neighbors when her mom die (Disney notes taken) they don't remember her existing at all (Not explained deeper in the anime) and it conflicts on Misora and her dad's relationship, but this is also what drives her to use her mom's blade gun and become a great Sky Wizard, to be a reminder to those who don't remember her that she was great and amazing.\\n\\n\r\nLecty, she has the highest potential to fuck your shit up in a fight, her only problem though is that she's incredibly shy and lacks confidence thus ruining her potential. Once you get to know the pressure she has, when you know where she comes from, it all becomes understandable. You even start to sympathize with her if you yourself have been there. Over the course of the show, it constantly puts her in what can be seen as fanservice moments, but it's a different kind of fanservice that actually HELPS the character to grow and works in the plot around her.\\n\\n\r\nRico, the self-proclaimed goddess of the group. She believes that she is the perfect human being, in terms of looks and skill there's no counter. Never forget, everybody has their weakness and Rico isn't an exception. No matter how she tries to play it off, she isn't perfect, in fact, it's her inferiority of her sister that lead her into this arrogant way of thinking that gave her this mind process. Her growth comes in the form of letting her inner-self come out and being able to work with her team and getting over the loser mentality that she doesn't let known.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the series it all comes to a helm with all of the characters better than they were before and on greater terms with each other and the payoff is needing to be seen. \\n\\n\r\n5. My enjoyment - I typically like series like this one and as I said before I like it, but am disappointed by it as well. The villains needed better explanation done onto them, one of them is needlessly made into a villain when he didn't have to be, and the end of them tournament is astounding. I will be rewatching this again though since it's still fresh in my mind and I want to take another look at it with the knowledge I have while making this review and I hope some of you also acquire this mindset when looking at it or looking at it again. \\n\\n\r\nThat's it.",

            "content": "This anime is one of the worst I've ever seen. I quite literally wanted to kill myself after I finished it. Don't watch this show whatever you do. \r\nStory 1/10:\r\nI barfed at this story. It is the most stereotypical story I've ever seen. The plot sort of makes sense with Fireteam (why tf is it called a fireteam?) E601 trying to become the best but they play it out so horribly that you just want to kill whoever the writer of this story was. Seriously, the plot just goes jumping around from the MC trying to get the girls to cooperate to some weird scientistwho is obsessed with some girl named Yuri. I really hated those interactions since they where awkward and that guy just kept obsessing over her to the point of a just wanting to drop the anime completely. Some animes do this amazingly but this is just at the bottom of the bucket. The world itself also makes no sense at all. Like why do they need to make an island where the humans can hide? Why not make it like God Eater or Attack on Titan with walls surrounding cities as building a giant freakin floating island sounds like more work than building a wall to protect them. What happened to the world? How did the humans let giant bugs take over the planet? How did these things happen? It overall is just a poor excuse for a story. It feels like some 3rd grader fresh out of watching AOT & SAO comes and is like \"Oh, I love SAO & AOT and I want to put them together. I know!!! Lets take the floating island of SAO along with the weapons, and the plot of AOT and make a brain-dead version of the show. Sounds like a great idea!!!\" Well this is the product of that. The ending of this show is just disappointing to me although what did I expect with all the complaints I had above. I'm not even going to say what the ending was because it was so bad, just trying to remember it just makes my brain hurt. \\n\\n\r\nArt 3/10:\\n\r\nThe animation is as I would put it, like the animators had the budget of a student animating stick figure videos and putting them on Youtube. The animation is so slow and choppy. You can really see it in the opening song. The animation is like playing COD at 5fps. Even looking at one of those old Stickman videos on Youtube or most other animations on the internet are better animated than this. The backgrounds I would say are drawn okay. Looks like some 7th grader or me drew it though. Pretty much any anime beats the animation in this anime with a few exceptions. I really don't like the style of art in this anime either. It's just bland, and there is nothing special about it. \\n\\n\r\nSound 4/10: \\n\r\nThe sound in this anime is not the worst. It's not bad it's not good. Opening is one of the worst openings I've ever seen. The song is just really bad overall in my opinion and the animation is horrible. The ending isn't that bad but none of the songs or OST would ever make it in a top video. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10:\\n\r\nOh god the characters, why the characters.... (Note: I forgot the names of the characters because they were so bad) First of all, the MC bland. He has like no character. He has pretty much no backstory. He is also super OP and that's pretty much it about him, a bland dude who I forget the name of because he was that bland. Now onto the Harem. \\n\\n\r\nRed-Haired Girl: \\n\r\nSome stereotypical girl that no one likes. So cliche in every way. She has some backstory but it's still bad just like the rest of the plot. If I could, I would just kill her off as soon as possible. Such a boring character in the end.\\n\\n\r\nBlond Girl:\\n\r\nBig chested shy girl. Super super shy and obviously falls for the MC for no reason. \\n\\n\r\nKami Girl:\\n\r\nJust as the title suggest, she is a girl who thinks of herself as a goddess. Any redeeming qualities about this girl? No\\n\\n\r\nYuri (I think that's her name):\\n\r\nI don't know why I remember this girl's name but I think it's from that weird scientist obsession with her. She likes the MC because this is a harem but really. No redeeming qualities about her either. \\n\\n\r\nAntagonists:\\n\r\nThe giant bugs....\\n\r\nGiant bugs are the antagonist of this anime? I think this would have fit in way better in a show such as One Punch Man. They barely appear in this show for being antagonist and just are horrible. \\n\\n\r\nScientist:\\n\r\nThis creepy guy who for some reason loves Yuri after smelling a tissue she dropped. It makes no sense what so ever. It's like me falling in love with some random girl from smelling her skin. The only time I've seen an anime pull off something like this is when Tsukiyama (Tokyo Ghoul) smells that blood stained tissue and wants to eat Kaneki. He has no development at all and is overall a horrible antagonist. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10:\\n\r\nFrom all the given above, you probably can tell how I feel about this anime. I really hated this anime and had no enjoyment in watching it. I felt like killing myself at the end of this because I really hated this so much. There is no re-watch value or anything in this anime at all. I love plot and characters, and as long as those are good, I can live with everything else being terrible but this was just absolutely horrifying. I feel like this shouldn't even exist, that's how bad this is. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 1/10:\\n\r\nJust stay away from this anime. If anyone tells you to watch this, they must have been shot in the head as they are brain-dead for even trying to make you watch this load of crap. I will never ever recommend this anime to anyone. It's so bad that it could be quite literally one of the worst animes ever created. It's on that level of don't watch because it's so bad, your eyes will melt out of their sockets like watching School Days or Boku no Pico. Just don't even attempt this watch. There is no redeeming value in watching this anime. Just run away from this anime. Save yourself from this crap.",

When I first saw this anime, I put it off because it looked too much like a harem anime (the 1 guy and 3 girls on the cover), but I regret my decision because this anime is AWESOME. Don't mind the haters, this anime has great story, nice art, and nice sounds. The only part that I would have liked to see more of would be character development, but you can onlydo so much in 12 episodes so considering that, it's pretty nice. There weren't any noticeable quality drops, unlike the more mainstream anime of the summer 2015 season Ex: Rokka no Yuusha and as a normal heterosexual guy, I cannot resist the cuteness of Yuri, even up to the last few minutes when she does something thats a big spoiler (maybe not if you've been paying attention to what shows on her face when talking to a certain someone).

            "content": "In order for people reading this review, to get a fully fledged understanding of my relation with this anime - I will here quote my first words upon just completing the last episode.\r\n\"Well that was f***ing dreadful*\r\nAnd thus, let the review begin:\r\nFirst of a short \"summary\" - Sky Wizards Academy appeared to me when I watched it's first episode only 10 minutes after HD release as something I actually had been looking forward to, the synopsis for the anime seemed rather promising and thus I had high hopes. Hopes that by the first episode was absolutely demolished beyond repair, yet to write a proper reviewwithout having seen all episodes is unfair to the series and it's creator(s) so I pulled myself trough the remaining of this car crash so I could leave this entry without feeling bad or speaking without having seen all that the anime had to offer.\\n\r\nSky Wizards Academy also became \"hard\" to judge - as it was not one of these 3-5 min skit animes nor one of the 10 min short's - I feel obliged to give it a full and most proper review rather than \"It was bad but made me giggle here and there so it gets 5/10\" like a 3-5 min skit anime could.\\n\\n\r\nSo let's break this into the different aspects, starting with the story -\\n\\n\r\n- Story: The story of Sky Wizards Academy was most likely the thing about this anime that STARTED of as the best element they had. Now it's not to stick under a chair that the main story line was cliche: \\n\r\n\"Earth destroyed by *Insert said thing here* (Devil Beetles)\" \\n\r\n\"Humanity retreats to a city / cities in the sky for safety reasons\" \\n\r\n\"Some Humans are born with the strength to fight said *Insert said thing here* - and thus named Sky wizards\" \\n\r\n\"We are following one team in particular that struggles with that they can't get along properly and that they all seem horrible at what they should be doing\" \\n\r\n\"In comes random hero from sometime in history and teaches them how to be better\" \\n\r\n\"The team does not like him, then they do, then they hate him, then they don't\"\\n\r\nIt's nothing new but it's not BAD either if portrayed the right way with the right characters - Which is exactly what Sky Wizards Academy managed to screw up so badly. But let's not head to the characters just yet - back to the story:\\n\r\nSo with a story that ALL ALONE and BY ITSELF would be more than fine for a season, you know - some more time into each aspect of training, team VS teacher\" and so on, but then they HAD to go on and bring in the most ridiculous \"side story\" ever seen before my eyes and then go on and make THAT the main part of the anime. No one EVER want's to see a story starting to revolt around some creepy stalker of a geezer that takes to \"desperate measures\" to obtain his love, I mean come on. That ALONE ruined this anime and I can with certainty say that this anime would have been way better of if it didn't ever introduce us to creepy stalker guy.\\n\r\nAnd WORST of all, the whole \"Traitor\" aspect. We got introduced to it: \"Oh he is a traitor\"but it wasn't even HINTED to WHY, HOW or WHEN, this made for a bunch of characters ALL over the place bringing the mood down as they all seemed salty over something we never got EXPLAINED. Sure the last episode gave a CLUE but never was there a sturdy answer to said \"Why. how and when\"\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10 for piss poor performance and execution.\\n\\n\r\n- Art: Where do I even start, I might was well pick out the only few positive aspects as they can be counted on my one hand - majorly the art here was terrible. The phasing was rather way to slow or way to fast, the character's didn't look lively at all or seemed as if they tried to hard in looking alive, the CGI with the Devil Beetles was so bad it had me tearing my hair out - and the combat scenes was just horrible beyond imagination or at worst: CGI animated. And when they first managed to get things looking good, it was on idle side characters or frozen frames of the main characters doing nothing - in addition a great deal of the art was bland, focused on the wrong aspects and worst of all - so poorly made that they just made the \"main focus\" of the shot a small detail in the corner and seemingly aiming for that people would look on the \"pretty\" background instead.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2/10 - Since a 1 would only be in store had the full thing been in Devil Beetle CGI style.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound: The most positive aspect all in all in the middle of this total wreck, I did not find the songs played in the background to be bad nor good, they managed to make it suit most scenes and the mood in general. A few hiccups here and there, specially with that \"ping\" sound they seem to love. but other than that the sound department did their job and should be rewarded for bringing SOME decency in the middle of all the other chaos.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10 - It was part of what kept me going in the long run.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters: My first thought after meeting the main crew of 4 was as split into two halves.\\n\r\n1: Oh lord I am already hating these girls and I am sure that they will haunt my dreams.\\n\r\n2: At least Kirito is here to make me smile as he usually does his job well and seems to be a carefree character, which might just keep me tuned.\\n\r\nAnd this divided train of thought was SPOT on. I spent the remainders of the anime in agony, watching what could have been awesome and lovable characters appear to me as some of the most annoying and obnoxious set people ever seen in the world of anime. I even had my girlfriend next to me for about 20% of the total run time of this anime, she could not hear it, only read the texting and even SHE found them so bad it was making her sick - That right there is a message when only 20% run time of characters you can't even HEAR makes you cringe.\\n\r\nTHANKFULLY - Kirito, I mean Kanata, was there all along as a carefree, funny bastard that made me smile when things was going down. doing a splendid job on holding me alive as I watched trough this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10 - You keep em smiling Kirito.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment: This is where things got scary, I pained myself trough each episode with the final goal of it all being to deliver a crushing blow to it all, setting fire to the car wreck, salting the wound, I was looking forward to that during this entire animes run time. While doing so I decided to play a bit \"Cinema Sins\" of YouTube and pointed out everything wrong in each episode and this helper on the overall enjoyment as well, making me still notice all the horrible part but still being able to enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10 - Finding mistakes has never been more fun. But that still does not make it a good thing to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nTo finish this all - I would like to say that this is not an anime I recommend at all, you want to avoid watching this like the plague if you know what's better for you.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's it for my review on Sky Wizards Academy, thank you all so much for reading and most of all - For your time. If a season two for this ever is announced you can be damn sure I will suffer myself trough that one as well since delivering hammers like this is something I could live and die for.\\n\\n\r\nTotal score roundup - 3/10.",

SPOILERS MAY BE PRESENT IN REVIEW!\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nFor story I gave it an 8/10 for a good reason. While many may disagree with me on the score, I feel it is well deserved. For one, the anime did impressively well at fleshing out as much as it could in only 12 episodes while also not overflowing or underwhelming us with information about the series. They; introduced the threat of the anime, showed why they'rea threat, made us aware of the main characters and their backstories, fleshed out the relationships they had with other characters, explained plot points about sky wizards (such as how non-sky wizards lose their memories of sky wizards who die), and still managed to give us just enough. However, being that it is only 12 episodes long, there were a few things off.\\n\r\n        For one, the Sky Beetles. They are the main enemies of the series, but we don't learn very much about them except that they're apparently really powerful and attack in swarms, but retreat if their commander is killed. We do not learn of their origins, nor do we learn of what figure head seems to really command them except for \"chimeras\" who act as generals. There's too many questions to be asked.\\n\r\n        My next issue is that we also know very little about the sky wizards themselves. How did they come into existence?  Where does their magic/power come from? Why do \"naturals\" forget about them when they die? I have to go a little easy on the series, though, because none of these questions for either the beetles or the sky wizards are the focus of the series. \\n\r\n        Rather, the focus of the series are three girls who make up a squad of failures, and it's up to a young man branded a traitor despite once being hailed as an elite. (He was branded a traitor because he refused to return to battle; The truth is revealed that after a very tough battle, Kanata was almost defeated in battle but instead gained powers of the Sky Beetles, the anime's main enemies. He didn't want others to find out.) So most of it focuses on them while feeding us more about other issues that exist in the anime. The Sky Beetles do play an important role, kind of, in the end but this is mostly plot driven. Granted it was developed over several episodes. I'd go on, but the rest will be talked about in my character section.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe artwork for this anime is very nice to look at. The dynamic colors and how it helps distinguish background and character designs I thought did a good job at making things easy on the eyes. However, I fear I cannot go further as my opinion on art is exactly that, opinion. I can't say with confidence that it is unbiased.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, the soundtrack for the anime was pretty decent. It helped create the mood during several scenes. It really made me feel the kind of pressure the main girls were under, and it also made me feel excited when things were going well. However, I have to admit that sometimes the soundtrack was lacking a bit and I barely noticed it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe anime is focused on four main characters, as well as several other characters who interact with our main four. I have to say, not a single character felt like they fit one particular archetype. This is especially since the characters develop so well. Each one changes in their own way, and each character has their own identity and quirks that make them unique. Sure, some of them retain some early characteristics, but they truly grow and overcome things in their lives thanks to one another. Each character has something to make you care about them, and I feel that there aren't any weak characters in the series. They pushed you to feel something for them, be it a desire to see them eat their words or the drive to cheer them on. That's what characters should do, drive emotion out of you and onto them, and it is exactly what they did. \\n\r\n     Take Lepty for example. She starts out super shy yet determined, but by the end of the series though she may be shy, she can also look her opponents in the eyes and not hesitate like she used to.\\n\r\n     Even more satisfying was watching the four main characters grow and bond as a team, more so for the three girls bonding as a team and learning to trust each other and their instructor. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed the series. I do hope that the show gets a second season as it left a bit to be desired, though not to its own fault. This is definitely something I would recommend to anyone looking for something short and enjoyable. It is action packed, has fun and engaging characters, and has pretty nice artwork. The characters are easily the strongest suit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nI've said plenty of what I feel I needed to say. Good story, good art, lackluster soundtrack, well developed characters, and high entertainment value. Many may disagree with my score, but I say give the anime a chance. Come into it with an open mind, but don't forget that everything comes with a bias, even people who try to be as in the middle as possible with their reviews.",

            "content": "Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan seemed like a great anime initially, but after watching it, I've come to the conclusion that it is one of the worst animes I have ever watched. It was so bad that I immediately came here to write a review about how terrible it actually was. Lets begin....\r\nThe Story: The story is a giant mess and the plots are even worse. There is literally no background story at all. We dont know what happened to Earth, all we know is that it was taken over by giant beetles and now we have magic. As for the plots, they normally comeout of thin air (just like the beetles) and usually never get solved. Overall, its a mess and will probably be lost by the 5th episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: Holy crap! The animation in this anime is so low budget, you could have sworn they ran out of money mid way. At one point, the characters would just fly by the enemy invaders (wouldn't even swing their swords) and they would explode into a puff of white smoke. True, some scenes were excellently done, but the majority of the fight scenes were cringe worthy\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: My only complaint was the annoying chanting that goes on during some scenes. It was a weird combination of the opening of Frozen and the opening song of Lilo and Stitch. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: The main character was honestly my favorite. He reminded me of a mixture of  Layfon from Chromed Shelled Regios and Kirito from SAO. If it wasn't for him, I would have ditched this anime at episode 6. Now lets talk about the main antagonist. This villian is literally so hatable/annoying that you will wish you could just kill him right on the spot. Im not talking about Cell (from DBZ) hatable where you hate his actions but he's actually pretty cool. I'm talking about down right annoying to the bone. The main villain was so annoying that I would rather listen the Sesame Street theme song, sang by Rebecca Black, on repeat for 10 hours than watching this stupid morphed cockroach talk about his sociopathical problems. Seriously, THIS DUDE RUINED THE SHOW! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Honestly, between the plot holes, skipping major fights, bad animation, and HORRIBLE characters, I gave this anime a 2/10. Never before has an anime LITERALLY CAUSED ME PAIN TO FINISH IT!! If you dont believe me, go check it out for yourself.\\n",

            "content": "I want to start off by saying: I was overwhelmed by how much i enjoyed, to a certain extent. This is anime is beautiful. The story's good and the art has an array of vivid and normal colours. (The vivid colours mostly refer to the characters hair, but that's whatever.)\r\nSo here we go.\r\nStory:\r\nThere isn't anything that particular stands out in the plot but, I did like the way it brought life to the characters and hinted at certain aspects of characters that seemed irregular and made for some interesting development. The fanservice is there, mostly in the changing rooms, but it shouldn't be considered allthat big of a hindrance to those who dislike that kind of \"plot\".\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is lovely and smooth. I love the vivid colour of Misora's hair, I think thats what sold the art for me. Otherwise the art is ok but nothing particularly special for its time.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAll anime of great sound so much to comment on other than sometimes the intermission/segment/half-way-point music can play a tune that doesn't particularly go with the current mood though some anime do that so I didn't penalize it too much in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are somewhat stereotypical for a group of people in most anime: OP main, someone who only cares about themselves, some who's too shy for their own good and bunch or others like a Tsundere heroine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDespite it's flaw's, I actually really like this one so I think, to me, my score for that aspect is relevant.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime with great artwork, an alright story, a bit of fan-service, some character development and people who fights evil bugs with magic, this will probably sit well with you. However if you're a dub person, I'm sorry but steer clear. I know this review views it in a somewhat positive light but, the English Dub switches out Lecty's voice actresses between Episodes 7 and 8. Kind of disappointing but no much we can do about it.",

            "content": "Welp this is basically that same harem action anime that comes every anime season. You constantly see ones like this but in different names such as \"Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance\", Seikoku no Dragonar, Absolute Duo and many many more. And a lot of these turn out mediocre and but some turn out good. This unfortunately was the latter. It has an extremely clique story, mediocre action and just awful characters in the for front.\r\nStory-\r\n Basically this story revolves around acadamy were \"devil bugs\" are attacking the world and students learn how to fight them in teams. Sound good so far....yea no well it getsbetter. We spend 90% of the anime trying to teach 3 girls who are the worst students how to be better.....yea thats fun..\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-\\n\r\nMale MC\\n\r\nProbably the worst thing about this anime holy crap! Basically We have an Male MC who has some past where hes called a traitor now but he used to be the strongest or something. Hes assign to teach these girls how to be a better team. Honestly hes the only redeemable character in this story. His mystery past and personally is the ONLY thing that got me to watch this as far as i did. Still he has his own problems and its the one most male MCs have in harem anime and its that there pushovers to the women. In this anime there are a lot of people bashing him calling him a traitor and stuff and he just takes it with a smile. I wish for once people can act like people and defend themselves. This is especially prevalent for females in this and other series. A girl can talk all the shit they want or even try to kill the MC at a point (in Dragonar academy) and the MC will still act like its not her fault cause shes a cute girl. its ridiculous.  Now the 3 Main female characters.\\n\r\nFemale MCs\\n\r\nHoly shit if they didnt choose the worst female cast ever holy shit. One (the red head) is your classic overly done bitchy, hot headed, i hate the male lead but randomly like him too, tsundere character. She is that clique to a \"T\". Plus she had some stupid story were she was forcing herself to learn a fighting style that the MC teacher said was impossible for her to improve with especially after all her years of training. Yet she randomly gives him a sad backstory and he says i can teach you it now....WTF kind of bull is that.\\n\r\nNext we have an EXTREMELY annoying, whiny, insecure, crybaby shy girl (the blond). Her constant shy voice is SOOO irritating throughout the anime holy crap. I couldnt stand her and every thing she says or does has to have some kind of shy studdering. It always takes a while for her do say anything which was infuriating.\\n\r\nLastly and by far the worst one in my opinion was An extremely pompous, head in her own ass, narcissistic girl (the long blacked haired one). She calls self a goddess for some past reason and treats people like crap, acts lazy and doesnt help with anything cause of it. Her attitude was so damn annoying in this and i couldnt take it every times she talked. So yea put all this annoying characters in one story and you got yourself one huge shit show. I mean i understand that part of the point of this anime was to help them be a better team and better people but frankly they all havent really changed at all till the end even. they have moments where they act a bit better but just go back to doing what they all do. And were suppose to like these characters yea no.\\n\r\nOthers-\\n\r\nThere are a few side characters but most make no real impact in this anime. There some that just bash the MC calling him a traitor and one girl whos exactly like the Red head tsundere. She treats him like crap but likes him.\\n\\n\r\nOver all-\\n\r\nAs you can see i didnt enjoy this lame ass anime. I mean the first 5 or 6 episodes were just trying to fix this annoying girls team work by doing random crap like maid cafes or listening to back stories and in the end they still were the same and still lost the next event. Then the rest was some side filler like story of this tournament and this yandere guy. I mean all i cared about was hearing the male MCs back story but i couldnt stomach watching this consistently anymore and i had to wait till it was finished to breeze through. This is lame, forgettable and a wast of anyone's time   \\n\\n",

Their is fan service, but the main lead is hardly ever their for it.  All of his students are all aiming for something, and he is trying to help them.\r\nStory:  Pretty basic, but well executed.  Nojumps in logic.  Nothing is done for shocker value.  Though that is not normally done in this genre.

I am not really that interested in art style as long as it is above a certain threshold I hardly notice it.

By the end you instantly knew when something was about to turn solely based on the music.  Voiced were amazing though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  They are all shown first episode basically.  You get a really good idea of who they really are and what flaws they have.  They all get a good amount of air time as they solve their issues and grow stronger.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  I enjoyed it but I have no idea why anyone would care that I enjoyed it.

Then why the hell are you paying attention to this show? Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei No Kyoukan is one of the worst shows I have ever seen, and the show on my list with the lowest rating. I am usually passive about the anime I watch, with most scoring 7-10, but this show.... this one deserves the score of a 3. \r\nIf you haven't got the hint yet from all the reviews above mine, this show isabsolutely terrible. The question to why the MC \"betrayed\" the academy is answered in the last episode, leaving you wondering the whole show why they call him a traitor. We only see him fight about 3 times throughout the show, once in the prologue, a second when the beetle shitters attacked, and a third at the last episode. That's it. I mean, come on, if you're gonna have an overpowered main character you could at least show him fighting more. The show leaves most of the fighting up to the three girls who all end up liking the generic OP main character (although the show denies all ties to the harem genre) in the end of the show. Another point of the main character, the formula he was made with makes him seem all cool, but he's one of those characters who try too hard to be cool. One of those, \"Oh, I saw you naked but i'm just gonna say put some clothes on,\" or one of those, \"Oh, you're naked in the bed and I know you are? How about I keep staring like I don't notice you're naked?\" To get my point across, the main character is one of the worst in the industry. \\n\\n\r\n  On to the heroines! Every review I read has a segment talking about how bad the girls are. I will change it up. Instead, I will talk about the good part of the heroines (Red head, Blonde, Bitch: as I like to call them) because if you want bad parts, go read the other reviews.\\n\\n\r\n                                 Only one of them is cute.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, done talking about the heroines! Next, lets talk about how shitty the animation is! The devil beetles (or shitters, as I like to call them) were done poorly, not looking flashy at all. They rarely show up during the show, other than (Just like how frequently the MC fights!) in the beginning, the middle, and the end. Actually, scratch that! They don't appear in the end of the show. For the whole show being centered around fighting them, they sure do show up a lot huh? I forgot we were talking about the animation and not how bad the antagonists are. The way the characters fly is so, so bad I closed my eyes every time they move. It looks like someone paused the show, dragged the character from one side of the screen to the other slowly, then resumed the show. Also, how the heck do the devil shitters appear en masse when the characters blow them up in hundreds?! Apparently they regenerate in a mothership somewhere, although the reason the devil beetles came and destroyed earth is not given at any point throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nNext, it's story time. LOL, get it? There is no story. I can describe the story in three sentences. 1. Kanata is overpowered and some event of the past turned him into a \"traitor\" (which i've seen this formula a lot. Main characters who are treated like the worst but secretly they're the best [Rakudai Kishi No Cavalry, The Asterisk War, etc.]) 2. To redeem himself he is given command of the worst fireteam, being set up for failure on purpose. 3. He makes them the best fireteam. BOOM. THREE SENTENCES. THAT'S THE WHOLE PLOT.  I COULDN'T GIVE YOU SPOILERS IF I WANTED TO.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the killing blow to this angry review, the conclusion. Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan is one of the worst shows you can find. Watching this will only make you want to order a 5-pack of Clorox bleach off of Amazon. It's also a poor excuse for a harem. The only thing that is REMOTELY good about the show, is the opening. I hate the ending. Skip it every time I hear the beginning. The opening is at least worthy of my ears, but the opening animation sucks, so I usually just listen to it with only audio. Anyway, the show is horrible. Animation sucks, plot development doesn't exist, sound is meh, enjoyment, ENJOYMENT? Is that what you think I got from this show? This show put me in crippling depression for a day! I would enjoy watching a mainstream anime over this shitfest of a show. Enjoyment is a 1. You're lucky there is no -10 Kuusen...\\n\\n\r\nAha! I finally figured out why you're looking at the reviews of this show! You were tortured into it, weren't you? I knew the government had some secret torturing tactics to get people to talk.",

            "content": "[Portuguese-BR] Demorei para assistir mais assisti, sinceramente n\u00e3o foi ruim, mas tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o foi bom. \r\nEu achei o anime bom na quest\u00e3o do protagonista, com uma personalidade muito boa. Mas as outras personalidades como o pessoal do time E601 que s\u00f3 tem personalidades clich\u00eas.\r\nAchei o anime muito mal explicado em muitos quesitos, como o Kanata tem aquele poder \"especial\". O anime n\u00e3o teve um fim muito legal, claro foi como se tivesse acabado um arco que \u00e9 a da evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da equipe E601, juntamente com aquele carinha obcecado pela Yuri, que ganhou um poder parecido para n\u00e3o dizer igual, ao Kanata. Por\u00e9m poderia ter mais,pois \u00e9 como se o problema com os besouros dem\u00f4nios tivesse acabado ali.\\n\\n\r\nAprender com esse anime? Bom n\u00e3o sei se eu aprendi algo, mas percebi que ser o centro das aten\u00e7\u00f5es pode ser bom, no caso do Kanata se ele quisesse poderia simplesmente receber virar de um \"traidor\" para um her\u00f3i. Mas n\u00e3o ele preferiu o anonimato, mostrando sua maturidade, e isso foi o que me inspirou a ver o anime.\\n\\n\r\nO que eu menos gostei, foi da personalidade de uma das antagonistas, tentando agir como uma deusa, n\u00e3o sei definir aquela personalidade mas sei que era muito enjoativo, e a Yuri, que aparentemente \"gostava\" do Kanata por\u00e9m vivia chamando ele de \"traidor\".\\n\\n\\n\r\n[English-EUA] I took time to watch more, honestly it was not bad, but it was not good either.\\n\r\nI found the anime good on the subject of the protagonist, with a very good personality. But the other personalities like the staff of the E601 team who only have personalities clich\u00e9s.\\n\r\nI found the anime very poorly explained in many issues, as the Kanata has that \"special\" power. The anime did not have a very cool ending, of course it was as if it had finished an arc that is the evolution of the team E601, along with that guy obsessed with Yuri, who gained a similar power not to say the same, to the Kanata. But there could be more, for it is as if the problem with the beetle devils had ended there.\\n\\n\r\nLearn from this anime? Well I do not know if I learned anything but realized that being the center of attention might be good, in the case of Kanata if he wanted he could simply get turned from a \"traitor\" to a hero. But he did not prefer anonymity, showing his maturity, and that's what inspired me to see the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I least liked, was the personality of one of the antagonists, trying to act like a goddess, I do not know how to define that personality but I know it was very nauseating, and Yuri, who apparently \"liked\" Kanata but lived by calling him \"traitor \".",

            "content": "Relatively moderate review this time, nothing too fancy but I do think this anime deserves a review since it did intrigue me quite a bit! I'm doing a review on Sky Wizard's Academy, an anime based around a protagonist, Kanata Age, that has recently been black listed a traitor due to his inactivity with his duty to protect his home of Mistgun. In his blacklisting, he winds up becoming an instructor for a group of misfit students that are considered the lowest of the students, as they still have yet to win a single match against any of their opponents.\r\nSo I'm going to start withthe story as it is probably the only thing actually holding this anime together unfortunately. While I really enjoyed the story and the way the plot held itself together, I feel like I know nothing that I want to know. I never really received any answers for anything that I might have been curious about or really had any part of where these antagonistic beings called the \"Devil Beetles\" came from, which honestly leaves me a little sad and truly desiring more from the story. In all honestly, as much as I feel like I didn't learn anything, I do feel extremly held together by the lack of information making me want to create my own story line, which, I do feel saved this anime significantly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSounds check out next as I feel they did alright with the voice actors, as I feel like I couldn't really put any other voices to fit the characters better than they do. I guess the lack of actual emotion in the anime makes it hard for me to feel that they truly fit does play a factor into it but I think they did alright portraying the character they way they were meant to be heard. As for action scenes and all the sounds that follow a sword and a rifle, they failed. Nothing sounded like it fit or didn't even make a sound at all which made following the fighting rather difficult. The intro song was amazing. I never skipped as it always made me feel ready and wanting to get the anime going. The outro on the other hand, I skipped every time after the first episode. I didn't really enjoy it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell, now with the animation, I don't think it did too bad but the CGI was awful. Nothing connected, every movement was way to stiff, and all the colors changed during the switches. And than to try and counter this issue, they stopped using CGI and just made the fights really slow and rather actually quite dull using just the normal animation. It went from bad to worse. But hey, I guess all the looks of the characters weren't bad. I did like their models and enjoyed their hairstyles and the look of their eyes quite a bit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was pretty foul.  While every character learned and progressed forward, it looked like they were just shooting in the dark and getting lucky. Nothing really connected to me to say that it made sense. Harder than that, none of the characters had back stories besides Misora, so it really felt forced and just pulled together. Nothing really impressive to say about it, sorry to say.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDespite this, I did enjoy the anime. I don't really understand why I enjoyed it so much, maybe it just had a feel of something I enjoyed in the past, but never the less, I did enjoy it. Watching the characters struggle and try to figure out what was going on made it a pretty good story, as rough as it was and since the characters didn't really have their backstories, maybe I enjoyed the mystery of trying to see how they all played out. I will end my rating with a 5/10 solely as an enjoyment rating to factor it out to something decent. It may not really be worth a watch, but I think it had promise.\\n",

            "content": "Every once in a while you\u2019ll come across an anime that\u2019ll literally help you grow as a person, help you understand some things you may have misunderstood, and when you do come across such anime you hold it in such a high regard that nothing else can even come close, and, on top of that, you begin believing anime to be the best entertainment medium there is.\r\nThen, unfortunately, you come across an anime so terrible, so bad, so devoid of any worth, that you want to quit it altogether, fly to Japan and kill anyone even remotely connected to the world of anime. Such isthe case with Sky Wizards. Welcome to a large, steaming pile of crap with literally only 1 decent thing in it: girls are kind of cute. No, seriously, that\u2019s literally the only reason I gave this thing 2 instead of 1. I bet that if you wanted to, you could write seminars depicting just how bad this thing is. You could teach young people, not just writers or directors, how NOT to live LIFE just based off on this anime. It packs so much \u2018bad\u2019, that if unleashed, it would corrupt the entire world and make everyone next gen Hitler. And, what\u2019s so bad about it you wonder? Well, I already said. Everything. \\n\\n\r\nStory is an incoherent mess. Plots get introduced out of nowhere, some are never resolved, there\u2019s no underlying, or rather \u2018main plot\u2019 whatsoever, there is 0 world building, and nothing of even remote interest occurs. Story is just a huge, steaming pile of mess. Even if I wanted to, there is literally nothing to spoil. No, I\u2019m not joking. You watch the 1st episode, and you KNOW how it\u2019s going to end. There\u2019s 0 debate there. Whatever underlying themes you think exist in this anime, you are wrong. And no, it\u2019s not my opinion, it\u2019s a fact. What underlying theme? Of growth? Overcoming your weakness? Suddenly becoming the most OP trio in the history of academy just by becoming \u2018better friends\u2019? Don\u2019t judge book by its cover?  If I were born a dumpster by any chance, and someone tried to throw away DVD\u2019s of this anime, I\u2019d throw them right back out. Is there some epic plot that spans the worlds? Nope. There\u2019s nothing epic about it. The entire thing occurs in a small city in the sky. Well then, for sure, that city must have gotten some major world building, seeing as it\u2019s the only place seen throughout the anime. Nope. I couldn\u2019t even bother remembering the name of the city. Nothing is given relation to something else. You don\u2019t know who lives here, you don\u2019t know what happens here, and you\u2019re not even sure just how big the city is. Well then, for sure, seeing as how condensed the story and world is, it must have some mysterious, heart-throbbing plots that eventually lead to a satisfying conclusion! Nope. There\u2019s nothing mysterious, heart-throbbing within this anime, and trust me when I say that the \u2018conclusion\u2019 is EVERYTHING but satisfying. I could write a book on just how terribly this show is written, but it\u2019d be a waste. Exposition is given abruptly, at random times, and even when we get it, they still don\u2019t explain anything. Who the hell are these bugs? Who controls them? Why are they attacking humans in the sky cities? Why are the human lives so important for them? How come some of them are bigger than others? Are they intelligent? Why can one of them speak? Is there the big bad guy somewhere controlling them all? How are they in such huge numbers when you show our characters kill literally thousands of them at time? How come some people can use magic and some don\u2019t? When did we evolve to the point of being able to use magic? Where did the magic come from? How are we even using it? Who created weapons that are catalyst of magic usage? Are they a necessity or just a helping tool? How come everyone is able to learn whatever everyone else is able to learn? Is there a set number of magic available and you just use whatever fits you? You wanna know? Yeah, well, too bad. You won\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\nArt, sound, animation \u2026 honestly, I can oftentimes overlook this \u2013 and I do. If the show is gripping in any other department, I\u2019ll simply overlook it and say \u2018well, their budget was limited and they did the best they could with what they had\u2019. But in the case of this thing, I can\u2019t. Art is as generic as anything you\u2019ve ever seen. Nothing sticks out. No character design, no building, no creature \u2013 everything is just \u2026 boring. And now the animation \u2026 oh sweet Satan I offer thee my soul to save me. When animators can\u2019t be bothered to animate a character LITERALLY just floating left and right, and instead use jump cuts of said character at left, middle and right, and dare REPEAT it 3 times, you know no one wanted to do anything with this thing. Calling animation stiff would be insult to every other anime with stiff animation. When things are animated, they\u2019re animated in such low framerate you just wish they didn\u2019t even bother animating it. Battles? What?! What the hell was that? I get more excitement from watching bonefire burn out than this thing. Throughout the entire show, you\u2019ll see STILL people flying through the air, swinging things in, and I swear, like 5 frames per second (it can probably cause heart attacks to faint hearted), seeing generic things shoot generic, dull-colored things, and the other things firing slightly bigger, differently colored generic things. There\u2019s no excitement. There is no battle in this anime you\u2019ll even remotely remember \u2013 no, not even \u201cthe final showdown\u201d. Nothing. Sound is just another thing where the generic side of this anime just shows its ugly head, and it shows it with pride. Same theme is repeated over and over again, at times even louder than anything else happening, as if creators were actually proud of it. Voice actors are \u2026 dull. They don\u2019t bring life to the characters \u2013 and, when they try to, they fail. I swear, Senyuu. had better art, animation, sound, story and characters. Let that sink in. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters \u2026 oh boy. I\u2019m not gonna even bother listing their names and will call them by their most defined trait: hair color. \\n\\n\r\nYou have red-haired girl; she\u2019s your generic semi-tsundere who wants to grow stronger and grows feelings for our MC despite treating him like crap generally. Development? Nope. Interesting dialogue, quirks, banters? Haha, good one. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have blonde-haired girl; she\u2019s your generic shy, tense, unable to look people in the eye type of a girl. She also, obviously, quickly grows attached to our MC and trusts him nigh unquestionably. Development? Haha \u2026 hahah \u2026 \\n\\n\r\nThen we have our blue-black-whatever-colored girl; she\u2019s your generic \u2018I\u2019m a goddess, treat me as such\u2019 character who never fails to annoy the crap out of you. She, of course, also grows attached to our MC, and her supposed \u2018issues\u2019 get addressed 2 times in one episode (well, rather than \u2018addressed\u2019, it\u2019s just shown she has them; they\u2019re never actually \u2018addressed\u2019). Development? Man, you never learn, do you? \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of our MC. He\u2019s your generic look-at-me, pump-up, all-thee-mighty character with questionable but working methods of improving people\u2019s skill by simply showing them following:\\n\\n\r\n1.\t1 special move\\n\r\n2.\tBecome friends\\n\r\n3.\tWork together\\n\\n\r\nSo, all of you out there \u2013 all of you who participate in sports or any kind of group activity, those 3 things above are ALL you need to become the very best, even though you were literally the worst like 1 month before. Hard work? Why? Sweating blood and tears for years and years in order to even slightly improve? Why? You can just become friends and boom, you can wipe everyone out. \\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019ve seen his character time and time again. He\u2019s your generic \u2018Oh, everyone treats me like crap but I\u2019m actually a nice guy\u2019, and he never deviates from that. In the first episode, he\u2019s shown to be blown up by an overwhelming attack (I\u2019m using that word quite loosely by the way), and I just assumed he was dead. But nope, he lived. How? Ah, who gives a crap! Look at just how cool he is instead! \\n\\n\r\nThere are also some other characters out there, each as generic as you can possibly come to generic: random psycho who falls in love with a girl and wants to kill everyone to prove something, tsundere girl in love with our MC but constantly throwing spiteful things at him, supporting duo of friends you know nothing about that pop up once in awhile just to tell audience that our MC isn\u2019t as bad as everyone is calling him, and so on and so forth. \\n\\n\r\nBeing completely blunt here: this is, quite possibly, one of the worst anime ever created \u2013 hear me out here, okay? Yeah, there are other anime out that are just as terrible, just as painful. But, when it comes to them, you can just laugh at how bad they are. You can point at something and say \u2018That doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s just terrible\u2019. Here? There is no pleasure from doing that. You\u2019re just reincorporating the idea that you actually DEVOTED THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE to watch this. Not only is it generic on every single fathomable level, it goes beyond that. It makes generic look masterpiece-like. If you ever felt you underappreciated certain anime, watch this. You\u2019ll not only appreciate said anime more, but you\u2019ll also begin appreciating your life and your time. \\n\\n\r\nIn case you hadn\u2019t noticed, no, I didn\u2019t enjoy this anime, not even the slightest bit. There\u2019s nothing clever about it, and even when the exposition inevitably hits, it explains nothing (making you wonder why was it there in the first place). Stay away from this, you\u2019ll have nightmares.",

It was as follows:\r\nThe story is set in a world where humanity, driven off the land by the threat of magical armored insects, now live in aerial floating cities. Thus wizards \u2014 aerial combat mages who fight the insects with magical powers \u2014 came into being.\r\nKanata Age (Eiji) is a young man who lives on the floating wizard academy city of \"Misutogan.\" He was once celebrated as the \"Black Master Swordsman,\" the elite ace of the S128 special team.

This is probably the worst anime of 2015 and one of the worst anime I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nThis is exactly how I finished watching the series:\\n\r\n1. Hmm, the girls are somewhat cute. \\n\r\n2. Why am I still watching this? Nvm, it's just a 12 episode series. And I still need to know why he called a traitor. \\n\r\n3. Holy shit, this anime is freaking terrible.\\n\r\n4. That's the end? It's over? Wait... What was the whole show about again?\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1/10 (I would give a 0 if I could.) \\n\\n\r\nWhat plot? What story? Who needs that when you are watching this crap!? Awesome fights with beetles!? None of that sort! Just forget about what you read in the synopsis!! No explanations or backstory to the beetles or its origin. Everything is in a mess here. I could try to spoil you but I can't, since there is no plot at all!! But, I will try anyways!!\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1: Generic Introduction!\\n\r\nEpisode 2 - 5: We need to train! Let's spend the next 4 episodes training for the match! \\n\r\nEpisode 6: HA! You don't even get to see the match they spent 4 episodes training for.\\n\r\nEpisode 7 - 11: Let's train! \\n\r\nEpisode 12: Fight scenes so amazing, I rather watch Goku charge up his Spirit bomb. This is how it went for the final showdown. Float left, float right, still images, more still images. Boom, it's over.\\n\\n\r\nThere, I spoilt it for you! Ha!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2/10 \\n\r\nThe only redeeming factor, girls are somewhat cute. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 0/10 (I don't care anymore. I don't care if the lowest score I can give is 1/10, because it deserves a 0.) \\n\\n\r\nThe worst action/battle I've seen EVER in anime history. I get more excited watching 2 still images hitting each other (Even Pokemon Battle animation in Pokemon Yellow in Gameboy colour is more interesting than this crap!!) I rather watch Goku charge up his spirit bomb and go AHHHHHH for 3 episodes. Stickman animations have 100x better fight scenes than what you will get here. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 2/10\\n\r\nNothing special to talk about. Gets a 2 because the op is not bad to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nThere wasn't any character development other than Misora but even then it was cringy and uninteresting.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nTo be honest, the first episode started off pretty decently for me. It got me interested. Then everything went to hell real fast from there onwards and you spend the remaining of your time wondering why the heck am I still watching this. The reason why this is a 2 is because I enjoyed wondering how bad an anime can get and was amused at how bad this anime is, it made me appreciate every other anime out there. \\n\\n\r\nOn behalf of everyone who managed finish this series, only 2 things kept us going: \\n\r\n1. Girls are cute.\\n\r\n2. WHY IS HE A TRAITOR!? STOP CALLING HIM A TRAITOR!! JUST TELL ME ALREADY. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst anime of 2015 by far, and one of the worst anime I've seen. Absolutely disgusting.\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10 (Literally given a 2 because the girls are cute.)",

            "content": "MY First Serious Review ! The review doesn't contain spoilers\r\nPeople say that the anime industry is going down. Well, that's completely wrong. What's going down is the quality of the anime. Unique plots is something rare to see in modern day anime. \r\nStory 4/10\r\nOne of the worst parts in the anime. The setting is in a fantasy world where magic exists. Yeah, you probably heard that in most synopsis of new anime. There's probably nothing special about the plot. Fanservice is there and in an excessive amount that makes this series unwatchable. This anime is probably going to the harem route but it's just aprobability because it doesn't focus on romance \\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10\\n\r\nI will be blunt about this, the art was mediocre if not crappy. You probably saw the character designs in another anime, especially the red haired tsundere. The fighting scenes were terrible and slow.\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\r\nNothing special in the sound department. The OP and ED are plain and normal.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10\\n\r\nI consider this part of the anime the worst. You just need one word to describe it, cliche. The protagonist is your OP main character, but I consider him the second best character. The first one is of course the Ice Cream guy. You have the Tsundere, red-haired feamle, the shy one and the narcissist one. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\r\nI'm really picky about the anime I watch. I try to avoid an anime that is about magic and contains a lot of fanservice. I tried to give this anime a chance but it was what I expected.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\r\nThis isn't the worst anime of the season. You probably would enjoy it if you didn't care about the plot and fanservice, but if you did, you'll probably drop it. Have a good day MAL community\\n",

            "content": "\"Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan\" or \"Sky Wizards Academy\" is one of those cliche animes with a cool main character, in this case Kanata, who just seems to meet girls in a weird situation and is inevitably forced to work together with them towards a similar goal. \r\nLike said, the story resolves around Kanata Age, a traitor as everyone calls him, who is assigned as the instructor of team E601 to win the Sky Wizards tournament in order for them to not be disbanded. What's the catch? The team is utterly useless, having suffered 10 losses in a row. With an incredibly shy girl Lecty,a self-taught \"goddess\" Rico and a leader who can't really lead Misora, what is gonna happen? Well, find out yourself.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise, as most of the action/drama animes, it lacks. Work towards goal, not working out, gradually working out, big bad guy, defeat big bad guy, good end. There wasn't any real emotional attachment given to the characters, so if someone died, you wouldn't have really felt anything. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the artwork. I can't really complain. I enjoyed the artstyle used and fancied the backgrounds. Characters were nicely made. I really took a liking to a few of the characters for the looks, but that was as much of a liking as you can get in this.\\n\\n\r\nSoundwise it's not bad, but it's not overly good. The voices were okay.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. I typically enjoy these shows just for the comedy and action, since you can't usually feel the drama. What brough the enjoyment of this one down were the action scenes. They were literally so boring I went into the kitchen to make a sandwich just to not watch them. Another good example of this would Seiken Tsukai no World Break. There wasn't any real emotion behind any of the fighting. I can still say I enjoyed it, but it could've been a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nIf it's so cliche and bad, why are you rating this a whole 8 out of 10? \\n\r\nWell, I am a sucker for anime such as this one.",

            "content": "(Know that this is only about the anime and not the light novel) After seeing all the reviews and it being recced on my anime page I had to see it and I expected it to not be to my liking, now honestly I'm more disappointed with it. I do like this anime and I think it could have been good if it wasn't thanks to possibly multiple things like not having enough episodes to flush things out that needed it or they were banking on people going to some manga or novel source where it comes from to get the money. Whatever it wasit I don't know, but this anime was something I know could have been better if handled right all the way through.\\n\\n\r\n1. The story - I think people only saw this as a harem sort of anime, probably because of the cliches showing on top, but when I watched this it's not really and the only ones who showed interest in the MC like that was Misora and Yuri who outright loved the guy. \\n\r\nThis is actually an underdog story like the movies some of us grew up with let's see if you can see the tropes: 1. There's a bunch of misfits with personal problems in an area that they are outclassed in by others around them and no one believes in them. 2. A badass top tier that has been shamed by his soon to be justified actions becomes their teacher due to circumstances. 3. They have a rocky meet. 4. They train in their interest sucking at first and in their personal lives to overcome their own inner weaknesses. 5. They are challenged by the higher than them antagonist the whole way. 6. In the first official competition they get into they lose. 7. After a bit more training, the team is ACTUALLY ready for the upcoming tournament. 8. They win in the next one and rise through the ranks in montage and then their main antagonist opponents are last to overcome and they win. \\n\r\nDoes this NOT sound familiar to you now? Do you SEE what I'm talking about now? That's what this actually is no matter what anyone but me tells ya  because I pretty much summed this whole thing up beat for beat and since I like this kind of story I think it's good.\\n\\n\r\n2. The art - The art is ok, it's nothing stellar, nothing you really say is the best thing about it though I give them some credit on their use of CGI on the monster enemy from hell, it's no Fate Stay Night nor is it Rakuen Tsuihou. It's right on the average middle that's good for anime. Special note on the way they die, it is glorious to see I recommend looking at the opening episode just to see how that it. The people's anime is anime hair, faces are faces, the things I like most though is the weapons which are, like RWBY and unlike it, are to the owners design and interesting to look at, but they aren't also a gun.\\n\\n\r\n3. The sound - In terms of VAs it's all around fine, the background music is pretty MMORPG-like, boom when action is there, light and flutes and violins all around when there's character time. It's pretty ok.\\n\\n\r\n4. The character - The characters are of their own trope and cliches: Kanata Age: He used to be the best, but thanks to things happening he's now known as a traitor. So to redeem himself, he has to make the worst team of Sky Wizards in terms of grades and skills a skilled and powerful one. Despite being marked a traitor, Kanata works earnestly to help out his girls and as a teacher fitting a trope he is a good one. He has an annoying habit though in that he forgets to mention crucial stuff to people before it actually happens.\\n\\n\r\nMisora Whitail, she's the tsundere and after a very harem-like meeting with Kanata the two are off to bad start, but don't let that fool you. While her character may look simplistic or unattractive for some, the reason she fights and her dreams are what makes her genuine. Living with her Muggle dad and neighbors when her mom die (Disney notes taken) they don't remember her existing at all (Not explained deeper in the anime) and it conflicts on Misora and her dad's relationship, but this is also what drives her to use her mom's blade gun and become a great Sky Wizard, to be a reminder to those who don't remember her that she was great and amazing.\\n\\n\r\nLecty, she has the highest potential to fuck your shit up in a fight, her only problem though is that she's incredibly shy and lacks confidence thus ruining her potential. Once you get to know the pressure she has, when you know where she comes from, it all becomes understandable. You even start to sympathize with her if you yourself have been there. Over the course of the show, it constantly puts her in what can be seen as fanservice moments, but it's a different kind of fanservice that actually HELPS the character to grow and works in the plot around her.\\n\\n\r\nRico, the self-proclaimed goddess of the group. She believes that she is the perfect human being, in terms of looks and skill there's no counter. Never forget, everybody has their weakness and Rico isn't an exception. No matter how she tries to play it off, she isn't perfect, in fact, it's her inferiority of her sister that lead her into this arrogant way of thinking that gave her this mind process. Her growth comes in the form of letting her inner-self come out and being able to work with her team and getting over the loser mentality that she doesn't let known.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the series it all comes to a helm with all of the characters better than they were before and on greater terms with each other and the payoff is needing to be seen. \\n\\n\r\n5. My enjoyment - I typically like series like this one and as I said before I like it, but am disappointed by it as well. The villains needed better explanation done onto them, one of them is needlessly made into a villain when he didn't have to be, and the end of them tournament is astounding. I will be rewatching this again though since it's still fresh in my mind and I want to take another look at it with the knowledge I have while making this review and I hope some of you also acquire this mindset when looking at it or looking at it again. \\n\\n\r\nThat's it.",

            "content": "This anime is one of the worst I've ever seen. I quite literally wanted to kill myself after I finished it. Don't watch this show whatever you do. \r\nStory 1/10:\r\nI barfed at this story. It is the most stereotypical story I've ever seen. The plot sort of makes sense with Fireteam (why tf is it called a fireteam?) E601 trying to become the best but they play it out so horribly that you just want to kill whoever the writer of this story was. Seriously, the plot just goes jumping around from the MC trying to get the girls to cooperate to some weird scientistwho is obsessed with some girl named Yuri. I really hated those interactions since they where awkward and that guy just kept obsessing over her to the point of a just wanting to drop the anime completely. Some animes do this amazingly but this is just at the bottom of the bucket. The world itself also makes no sense at all. Like why do they need to make an island where the humans can hide? Why not make it like God Eater or Attack on Titan with walls surrounding cities as building a giant freakin floating island sounds like more work than building a wall to protect them. What happened to the world? How did the humans let giant bugs take over the planet? How did these things happen? It overall is just a poor excuse for a story. It feels like some 3rd grader fresh out of watching AOT & SAO comes and is like \"Oh, I love SAO & AOT and I want to put them together. I know!!! Lets take the floating island of SAO along with the weapons, and the plot of AOT and make a brain-dead version of the show. Sounds like a great idea!!!\" Well this is the product of that. The ending of this show is just disappointing to me although what did I expect with all the complaints I had above. I'm not even going to say what the ending was because it was so bad, just trying to remember it just makes my brain hurt. \\n\\n\r\nArt 3/10:\\n\r\nThe animation is as I would put it, like the animators had the budget of a student animating stick figure videos and putting them on Youtube. The animation is so slow and choppy. You can really see it in the opening song. The animation is like playing COD at 5fps. Even looking at one of those old Stickman videos on Youtube or most other animations on the internet are better animated than this. The backgrounds I would say are drawn okay. Looks like some 7th grader or me drew it though. Pretty much any anime beats the animation in this anime with a few exceptions. I really don't like the style of art in this anime either. It's just bland, and there is nothing special about it. \\n\\n\r\nSound 4/10: \\n\r\nThe sound in this anime is not the worst. It's not bad it's not good. Opening is one of the worst openings I've ever seen. The song is just really bad overall in my opinion and the animation is horrible. The ending isn't that bad but none of the songs or OST would ever make it in a top video. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10:\\n\r\nOh god the characters, why the characters.... (Note: I forgot the names of the characters because they were so bad) First of all, the MC bland. He has like no character. He has pretty much no backstory. He is also super OP and that's pretty much it about him, a bland dude who I forget the name of because he was that bland. Now onto the Harem. \\n\\n\r\nRed-Haired Girl: \\n\r\nSome stereotypical girl that no one likes. So cliche in every way. She has some backstory but it's still bad just like the rest of the plot. If I could, I would just kill her off as soon as possible. Such a boring character in the end.\\n\\n\r\nBlond Girl:\\n\r\nBig chested shy girl. Super super shy and obviously falls for the MC for no reason. \\n\\n\r\nKami Girl:\\n\r\nJust as the title suggest, she is a girl who thinks of herself as a goddess. Any redeeming qualities about this girl? No\\n\\n\r\nYuri (I think that's her name):\\n\r\nI don't know why I remember this girl's name but I think it's from that weird scientist obsession with her. She likes the MC because this is a harem but really. No redeeming qualities about her either. \\n\\n\r\nAntagonists:\\n\r\nThe giant bugs....\\n\r\nGiant bugs are the antagonist of this anime? I think this would have fit in way better in a show such as One Punch Man. They barely appear in this show for being antagonist and just are horrible. \\n\\n\r\nScientist:\\n\r\nThis creepy guy who for some reason loves Yuri after smelling a tissue she dropped. It makes no sense what so ever. It's like me falling in love with some random girl from smelling her skin. The only time I've seen an anime pull off something like this is when Tsukiyama (Tokyo Ghoul) smells that blood stained tissue and wants to eat Kaneki. He has no development at all and is overall a horrible antagonist. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10:\\n\r\nFrom all the given above, you probably can tell how I feel about this anime. I really hated this anime and had no enjoyment in watching it. I felt like killing myself at the end of this because I really hated this so much. There is no re-watch value or anything in this anime at all. I love plot and characters, and as long as those are good, I can live with everything else being terrible but this was just absolutely horrifying. I feel like this shouldn't even exist, that's how bad this is. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 1/10:\\n\r\nJust stay away from this anime. If anyone tells you to watch this, they must have been shot in the head as they are brain-dead for even trying to make you watch this load of crap. I will never ever recommend this anime to anyone. It's so bad that it could be quite literally one of the worst animes ever created. It's on that level of don't watch because it's so bad, your eyes will melt out of their sockets like watching School Days or Boku no Pico. Just don't even attempt this watch. There is no redeeming value in watching this anime. Just run away from this anime. Save yourself from this crap.",

When I first saw this anime, I put it off because it looked too much like a harem anime (the 1 guy and 3 girls on the cover), but I regret my decision because this anime is AWESOME. Don't mind the haters, this anime has great story, nice art, and nice sounds. The only part that I would have liked to see more of would be character development, but you can onlydo so much in 12 episodes so considering that, it's pretty nice. There weren't any noticeable quality drops, unlike the more mainstream anime of the summer 2015 season Ex: Rokka no Yuusha and as a normal heterosexual guy, I cannot resist the cuteness of Yuri, even up to the last few minutes when she does something thats a big spoiler (maybe not if you've been paying attention to what shows on her face when talking to a certain someone). Overall, it was a great anime that I looked forwards to watching every week.",

            "content": "In order for people reading this review, to get a fully fledged understanding of my relation with this anime - I will here quote my first words upon just completing the last episode.\r\n\"Well that was f***ing dreadful*\r\nAnd thus, let the review begin:\r\nFirst of a short \"summary\" - Sky Wizards Academy appeared to me when I watched it's first episode only 10 minutes after HD release as something I actually had been looking forward to, the synopsis for the anime seemed rather promising and thus I had high hopes. Hopes that by the first episode was absolutely demolished beyond repair, yet to write a proper reviewwithout having seen all episodes is unfair to the series and it's creator(s) so I pulled myself trough the remaining of this car crash so I could leave this entry without feeling bad or speaking without having seen all that the anime had to offer.\\n\r\nSky Wizards Academy also became \"hard\" to judge - as it was not one of these 3-5 min skit animes nor one of the 10 min short's - I feel obliged to give it a full and most proper review rather than \"It was bad but made me giggle here and there so it gets 5/10\" like a 3-5 min skit anime could.\\n\\n\r\nSo let's break this into the different aspects, starting with the story -\\n\\n\r\n- Story: The story of Sky Wizards Academy was most likely the thing about this anime that STARTED of as the best element they had. Now it's not to stick under a chair that the main story line was cliche: \\n\r\n\"Earth destroyed by *Insert said thing here* (Devil Beetles)\" \\n\r\n\"Humanity retreats to a city / cities in the sky for safety reasons\" \\n\r\n\"Some Humans are born with the strength to fight said *Insert said thing here* - and thus named Sky wizards\" \\n\r\n\"We are following one team in particular that struggles with that they can't get along properly and that they all seem horrible at what they should be doing\" \\n\r\n\"In comes random hero from sometime in history and teaches them how to be better\" \\n\r\n\"The team does not like him, then they do, then they hate him, then they don't\"\\n\r\nIt's nothing new but it's not BAD either if portrayed the right way with the right characters - Which is exactly what Sky Wizards Academy managed to screw up so badly. But let's not head to the characters just yet - back to the story:\\n\r\nSo with a story that ALL ALONE and BY ITSELF would be more than fine for a season, you know - some more time into each aspect of training, team VS teacher\" and so on, but then they HAD to go on and bring in the most ridiculous \"side story\" ever seen before my eyes and then go on and make THAT the main part of the anime. No one EVER want's to see a story starting to revolt around some creepy stalker of a geezer that takes to \"desperate measures\" to obtain his love, I mean come on. That ALONE ruined this anime and I can with certainty say that this anime would have been way better of if it didn't ever introduce us to creepy stalker guy.\\n\r\nAnd WORST of all, the whole \"Traitor\" aspect. We got introduced to it: \"Oh he is a traitor\"but it wasn't even HINTED to WHY, HOW or WHEN, this made for a bunch of characters ALL over the place bringing the mood down as they all seemed salty over something we never got EXPLAINED. Sure the last episode gave a CLUE but never was there a sturdy answer to said \"Why. how and when\"\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10 for piss poor performance and execution.\\n\\n\r\n- Art: Where do I even start, I might was well pick out the only few positive aspects as they can be counted on my one hand - majorly the art here was terrible. The phasing was rather way to slow or way to fast, the character's didn't look lively at all or seemed as if they tried to hard in looking alive, the CGI with the Devil Beetles was so bad it had me tearing my hair out - and the combat scenes was just horrible beyond imagination or at worst: CGI animated. And when they first managed to get things looking good, it was on idle side characters or frozen frames of the main characters doing nothing - in addition a great deal of the art was bland, focused on the wrong aspects and worst of all - so poorly made that they just made the \"main focus\" of the shot a small detail in the corner and seemingly aiming for that people would look on the \"pretty\" background instead.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 2/10 - Since a 1 would only be in store had the full thing been in Devil Beetle CGI style.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound: The most positive aspect all in all in the middle of this total wreck, I did not find the songs played in the background to be bad nor good, they managed to make it suit most scenes and the mood in general. A few hiccups here and there, specially with that \"ping\" sound they seem to love. but other than that the sound department did their job and should be rewarded for bringing SOME decency in the middle of all the other chaos.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10 - It was part of what kept me going in the long run.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters: My first thought after meeting the main crew of 4 was as split into two halves.\\n\r\n1: Oh lord I am already hating these girls and I am sure that they will haunt my dreams.\\n\r\n2: At least Kirito is here to make me smile as he usually does his job well and seems to be a carefree character, which might just keep me tuned.\\n\r\nAnd this divided train of thought was SPOT on. I spent the remainders of the anime in agony, watching what could have been awesome and lovable characters appear to me as some of the most annoying and obnoxious set people ever seen in the world of anime. I even had my girlfriend next to me for about 20% of the total run time of this anime, she could not hear it, only read the texting and even SHE found them so bad it was making her sick - That right there is a message when only 20% run time of characters you can't even HEAR makes you cringe.\\n\r\nTHANKFULLY - Kirito, I mean Kanata, was there all along as a carefree, funny bastard that made me smile when things was going down. doing a splendid job on holding me alive as I watched trough this series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10 - You keep em smiling Kirito.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment: This is where things got scary, I pained myself trough each episode with the final goal of it all being to deliver a crushing blow to it all, setting fire to the car wreck, salting the wound, I was looking forward to that during this entire animes run time. While doing so I decided to play a bit \"Cinema Sins\" of YouTube and pointed out everything wrong in each episode and this helper on the overall enjoyment as well, making me still notice all the horrible part but still being able to enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10 - Finding mistakes has never been more fun. But that still does not make it a good thing to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nTo finish this all - I would like to say that this is not an anime I recommend at all, you want to avoid watching this like the plague if you know what's better for you.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's it for my review on Sky Wizards Academy, thank you all so much for reading and most of all - For your time. If a season two for this ever is announced you can be damn sure I will suffer myself trough that one as well since delivering hammers like this is something I could live and die for.\\n\\n\r\nTotal score roundup - 3/10.",

            "content": "Hello, this is my first review on this site, so I'd like you all to keep that in mind. I have reviewed other anime, but that was on my facebook page.\r\nWARNING! WARNING! SPOILERS MAY BE PRESENT IN REVIEW!\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nFor story I gave it an 8/10 for a good reason. While many may disagree with me on the score, I feel it is well deserved. For one, the anime did impressively well at fleshing out as much as it could in only 12 episodes while also not overflowing or underwhelming us with information about the series. They; introduced the threat of the anime, showed why they'rea threat, made us aware of the main characters and their backstories, fleshed out the relationships they had with other characters, explained plot points about sky wizards (such as how non-sky wizards lose their memories of sky wizards who die), and still managed to give us just enough. However, being that it is only 12 episodes long, there were a few things off.\\n\r\n        For one, the Sky Beetles. They are the main enemies of the series, but we don't learn very much about them except that they're apparently really powerful and attack in swarms, but retreat if their commander is killed. We do not learn of their origins, nor do we learn of what figure head seems to really command them except for \"chimeras\" who act as generals. There's too many questions to be asked.\\n\r\n        My next issue is that we also know very little about the sky wizards themselves. How did they come into existence?  Where does their magic/power come from? Why do \"naturals\" forget about them when they die? I have to go a little easy on the series, though, because none of these questions for either the beetles or the sky wizards are the focus of the series. \\n\r\n        Rather, the focus of the series are three girls who make up a squad of failures, and it's up to a young man branded a traitor despite once being hailed as an elite. (He was branded a traitor because he refused to return to battle; The truth is revealed that after a very tough battle, Kanata was almost defeated in battle but instead gained powers of the Sky Beetles, the anime's main enemies. He didn't want others to find out.) So most of it focuses on them while feeding us more about other issues that exist in the anime. The Sky Beetles do play an important role, kind of, in the end but this is mostly plot driven. Granted it was developed over several episodes. I'd go on, but the rest will be talked about in my character section.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe artwork for this anime is very nice to look at. The dynamic colors and how it helps distinguish background and character designs I thought did a good job at making things easy on the eyes. However, I fear I cannot go further as my opinion on art is exactly that, opinion. I can't say with confidence that it is unbiased.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, the soundtrack for the anime was pretty decent. It helped create the mood during several scenes. It really made me feel the kind of pressure the main girls were under, and it also made me feel excited when things were going well. However, I have to admit that sometimes the soundtrack was lacking a bit and I barely noticed it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe anime is focused on four main characters, as well as several other characters who interact with our main four. I have to say, not a single character felt like they fit one particular archetype. This is especially since the characters develop so well. Each one changes in their own way, and each character has their own identity and quirks that make them unique. Sure, some of them retain some early characteristics, but they truly grow and overcome things in their lives thanks to one another. Each character has something to make you care about them, and I feel that there aren't any weak characters in the series. They pushed you to feel something for them, be it a desire to see them eat their words or the drive to cheer them on. That's what characters should do, drive emotion out of you and onto them, and it is exactly what they did. \\n\r\n     Take Lepty for example. She starts out super shy yet determined, but by the end of the series though she may be shy, she can also look her opponents in the eyes and not hesitate like she used to.\\n\r\n     Even more satisfying was watching the four main characters grow and bond as a team, more so for the three girls bonding as a team and learning to trust each other and their instructor. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed the series. I do hope that the show gets a second season as it left a bit to be desired, though not to its own fault. This is definitely something I would recommend to anyone looking for something short and enjoyable. It is action packed, has fun and engaging characters, and has pretty nice artwork. The characters are easily the strongest suit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nI've said plenty of what I feel I needed to say. Good story, good art, lackluster soundtrack, well developed characters, and high entertainment value. Many may disagree with my score, but I say give the anime a chance. Come into it with an open mind, but don't forget that everything comes with a bias, even people who try to be as in the middle as possible with their reviews.",

            "content": "Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan seemed like a great anime initially, but after watching it, I've come to the conclusion that it is one of the worst animes I have ever watched. It was so bad that I immediately came here to write a review about how terrible it actually was. Lets begin....\r\nThe Story: The story is a giant mess and the plots are even worse. There is literally no background story at all. We dont know what happened to Earth, all we know is that it was taken over by giant beetles and now we have magic. As for the plots, they normally comeout of thin air (just like the beetles) and usually never get solved. Overall, its a mess and will probably be lost by the 5th episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: Holy crap! The animation in this anime is so low budget, you could have sworn they ran out of money mid way. At one point, the characters would just fly by the enemy invaders (wouldn't even swing their swords) and they would explode into a puff of white smoke. True, some scenes were excellently done, but the majority of the fight scenes were cringe worthy\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: My only complaint was the annoying chanting that goes on during some scenes. It was a weird combination of the opening of Frozen and the opening song of Lilo and Stitch. \\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: The main character was honestly my favorite. He reminded me of a mixture of  Layfon from Chromed Shelled Regios and Kirito from SAO. If it wasn't for him, I would have ditched this anime at episode 6. Now lets talk about the main antagonist. This villian is literally so hatable/annoying that you will wish you could just kill him right on the spot. Im not talking about Cell (from DBZ) hatable where you hate his actions but he's actually pretty cool. I'm talking about down right annoying to the bone. The main villain was so annoying that I would rather listen the Sesame Street theme song, sang by Rebecca Black, on repeat for 10 hours than watching this stupid morphed cockroach talk about his sociopathical problems. Seriously, THIS DUDE RUINED THE SHOW! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Honestly, between the plot holes, skipping major fights, bad animation, and HORRIBLE characters, I gave this anime a 2/10. Never before has an anime LITERALLY CAUSED ME PAIN TO FINISH IT!! If you dont believe me, go check it out for yourself.\\n",

            "content": "I want to start off by saying: I was overwhelmed by how much i enjoyed, to a certain extent. This is anime is beautiful. The story's good and the art has an array of vivid and normal colours. (The vivid colours mostly refer to the characters hair, but that's whatever.)\r\nSo here we go.\r\nStory:\r\nThere isn't anything that particular stands out in the plot but, I did like the way it brought life to the characters and hinted at certain aspects of characters that seemed irregular and made for some interesting development. The fanservice is there, mostly in the changing rooms, but it shouldn't be considered allthat big of a hindrance to those who dislike that kind of \"plot\".\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is lovely and smooth. I love the vivid colour of Misora's hair, I think thats what sold the art for me. Otherwise the art is ok but nothing particularly special for its time.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAll anime of great sound so much to comment on other than sometimes the intermission/segment/half-way-point music can play a tune that doesn't particularly go with the current mood though some anime do that so I didn't penalize it too much in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are somewhat stereotypical for a group of people in most anime: OP main, someone who only cares about themselves, some who's too shy for their own good and bunch or others like a Tsundere heroine.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDespite it's flaw's, I actually really like this one so I think, to me, my score for that aspect is relevant.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an anime with great artwork, an alright story, a bit of fan-service, some character development and people who fights evil bugs with magic, this will probably sit well with you. However if you're a dub person, I'm sorry but steer clear. I know this review views it in a somewhat positive light but, the English Dub switches out Lecty's voice actresses between Episodes 7 and 8. Kind of disappointing but no much we can do about it.",

            "content": "Welp this is basically that same harem action anime that comes every anime season. You constantly see ones like this but in different names such as \"Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance\", Seikoku no Dragonar, Absolute Duo and many many more. And a lot of these turn out mediocre and but some turn out good. This unfortunately was the latter. It has an extremely clique story, mediocre action and just awful characters in the for front.\r\nStory-\r\n Basically this story revolves around acadamy were \"devil bugs\" are attacking the world and students learn how to fight them in teams. Sound good so far....yea no well it getsbetter. We spend 90% of the anime trying to teach 3 girls who are the worst students how to be better.....yea thats fun..\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-\\n\r\nMale MC\\n\r\nProbably the worst thing about this anime holy crap! Basically We have an Male MC who has some past where hes called a traitor now but he used to be the strongest or something. Hes assign to teach these girls how to be a better team. Honestly hes the only redeemable character in this story. His mystery past and personally is the ONLY thing that got me to watch this as far as i did. Still he has his own problems and its the one most male MCs have in harem anime and its that there pushovers to the women. In this anime there are a lot of people bashing him calling him a traitor and stuff and he just takes it with a smile. I wish for once people can act like people and defend themselves. This is especially prevalent for females in this and other series. A girl can talk all the shit they want or even try to kill the MC at a point (in Dragonar academy) and the MC will still act like its not her fault cause shes a cute girl. its ridiculous.  Now the 3 Main female characters.\\n\r\nFemale MCs\\n\r\nHoly shit if they didnt choose the worst female cast ever holy shit. One (the red head) is your classic overly done bitchy, hot headed, i hate the male lead but randomly like him too, tsundere character. She is that clique to a \"T\". Plus she had some stupid story were she was forcing herself to learn a fighting style that the MC teacher said was impossible for her to improve with especially after all her years of training. Yet she randomly gives him a sad backstory and he says i can teach you it now....WTF kind of bull is that.\\n\r\nNext we have an EXTREMELY annoying, whiny, insecure, crybaby shy girl (the blond). Her constant shy voice is SOOO irritating throughout the anime holy crap. I couldnt stand her and every thing she says or does has to have some kind of shy studdering. It always takes a while for her do say anything which was infuriating.\\n\r\nLastly and by far the worst one in my opinion was An extremely pompous, head in her own ass, narcissistic girl (the long blacked haired one). She calls self a goddess for some past reason and treats people like crap, acts lazy and doesnt help with anything cause of it. Her attitude was so damn annoying in this and i couldnt take it every times she talked. So yea put all this annoying characters in one story and you got yourself one huge shit show. I mean i understand that part of the point of this anime was to help them be a better team and better people but frankly they all havent really changed at all till the end even. they have moments where they act a bit better but just go back to doing what they all do. And were suppose to like these characters yea no.\\n\r\nOthers-\\n\r\nThere are a few side characters but most make no real impact in this anime. There some that just bash the MC calling him a traitor and one girl whos exactly like the Red head tsundere. She treats him like crap but likes him.\\n\\n\r\nOver all-\\n\r\nAs you can see i didnt enjoy this lame ass anime. I mean the first 5 or 6 episodes were just trying to fix this annoying girls team work by doing random crap like maid cafes or listening to back stories and in the end they still were the same and still lost the next event. Then the rest was some side filler like story of this tournament and this yandere guy. I mean all i cared about was hearing the male MCs back story but i couldnt stomach watching this consistently anymore and i had to wait till it was finished to breeze through. This is lame, forgettable and a wast of anyone's time   \\n\\n",

            "content": "Only writing this to help others have a good mind set going into it.  I kind of held off because I saw a bunch of 1-3's but It is not.  It will be if you go into it with the wrong mind set.  This is not really a harem.  He is not after the girls and most are not after him.  Their is fan service, but the main lead is hardly ever their for it.  All of his students are all aiming for something, and he is trying to help them.\r\nStory:  Pretty basic, but well executed.  Nojumps in logic.  Nothing is done for shocker value.  Though that is not normally done in this genre. Ending also wrapped up nicely which is always important.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  I would say it was rather enjoyable.  I am not really that interested in art style as long as it is above a certain threshold I hardly notice it.  This was fairly well done and I had no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nSound: it was all well done as well, though the suspenseful \"holy shit this is happening\" music was always the same.  By the end you instantly knew when something was about to turn solely based on the music.  Voiced were amazing though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  They are all shown first episode basically.  You get a really good idea of who they really are and what flaws they have.  They all get a good amount of air time as they solve their issues and grow stronger.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  I enjoyed it but I have no idea why anyone would care that I enjoyed it.  I would say if you watch the first three episodes and are not enjoying it drop it.  The first one can paint a false picture.  The second kind of gets you to realize what it really is.  Then by the third you get it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  I would watch a second season.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a story about the weak and misunderstood growing to become strong but still unappreciated yet they are still fine with it, this might just be for you.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Who dared you to look at this show? ...Huh? You weren't dared? Okay, well, who forced you to look at this show? ...WHAT? You weren't forced to research it? Then why the hell are you paying attention to this show? Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei No Kyoukan is one of the worst shows I have ever seen, and the show on my list with the lowest rating. I am usually passive about the anime I watch, with most scoring 7-10, but this show.... this one deserves the score of a 3. \r\nIf you haven't got the hint yet from all the reviews above mine, this show isabsolutely terrible. The question to why the MC \"betrayed\" the academy is answered in the last episode, leaving you wondering the whole show why they call him a traitor. We only see him fight about 3 times throughout the show, once in the prologue, a second when the beetle shitters attacked, and a third at the last episode. That's it. I mean, come on, if you're gonna have an overpowered main character you could at least show him fighting more. The show leaves most of the fighting up to the three girls who all end up liking the generic OP main character (although the show denies all ties to the harem genre) in the end of the show. Another point of the main character, the formula he was made with makes him seem all cool, but he's one of those characters who try too hard to be cool. One of those, \"Oh, I saw you naked but i'm just gonna say put some clothes on,\" or one of those, \"Oh, you're naked in the bed and I know you are? How about I keep staring like I don't notice you're naked?\" To get my point across, the main character is one of the worst in the industry. \\n\\n\r\n  On to the heroines! Every review I read has a segment talking about how bad the girls are. I will change it up. Instead, I will talk about the good part of the heroines (Red head, Blonde, Bitch: as I like to call them) because if you want bad parts, go read the other reviews.\\n\\n\r\n                                 Only one of them is cute.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, done talking about the heroines! Next, lets talk about how shitty the animation is! The devil beetles (or shitters, as I like to call them) were done poorly, not looking flashy at all. They rarely show up during the show, other than (Just like how frequently the MC fights!) in the beginning, the middle, and the end. Actually, scratch that! They don't appear in the end of the show. For the whole show being centered around fighting them, they sure do show up a lot huh? I forgot we were talking about the animation and not how bad the antagonists are. The way the characters fly is so, so bad I closed my eyes every time they move. It looks like someone paused the show, dragged the character from one side of the screen to the other slowly, then resumed the show. Also, how the heck do the devil shitters appear en masse when the characters blow them up in hundreds?! Apparently they regenerate in a mothership somewhere, although the reason the devil beetles came and destroyed earth is not given at any point throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nNext, it's story time. LOL, get it? There is no story. I can describe the story in three sentences. 1. Kanata is overpowered and some event of the past turned him into a \"traitor\" (which i've seen this formula a lot. Main characters who are treated like the worst but secretly they're the best [Rakudai Kishi No Cavalry, The Asterisk War, etc.]) 2. To redeem himself he is given command of the worst fireteam, being set up for failure on purpose. 3. He makes them the best fireteam. BOOM. THREE SENTENCES. THAT'S THE WHOLE PLOT.  I COULDN'T GIVE YOU SPOILERS IF I WANTED TO.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the killing blow to this angry review, the conclusion. Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan is one of the worst shows you can find. Watching this will only make you want to order a 5-pack of Clorox bleach off of Amazon. It's also a poor excuse for a harem. The only thing that is REMOTELY good about the show, is the opening. I hate the ending. Skip it every time I hear the beginning. The opening is at least worthy of my ears, but the opening animation sucks, so I usually just listen to it with only audio. Anyway, the show is horrible. Animation sucks, plot development doesn't exist, sound is meh, enjoyment, ENJOYMENT? Is that what you think I got from this show? This show put me in crippling depression for a day! I would enjoy watching a mainstream anime over this shitfest of a show. Enjoyment is a 1. You're lucky there is no -10 Kuusen...\\n\\n\r\nAha! I finally figured out why you're looking at the reviews of this show! You were tortured into it, weren't you? I knew the government had some secret torturing tactics to get people to talk.",

Mas as outras personalidades como o pessoal do time E601 que s\u00f3 tem personalidades clich\u00eas.\r\nAchei o anime muito mal explicado em muitos quesitos, como o Kanata tem aquele poder \"especial\". O anime n\u00e3o teve um fim muito legal, claro foi como se tivesse acabado um arco que \u00e9 a da evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da equipe E601, juntamente com aquele carinha obcecado pela Yuri, que ganhou um poder parecido para n\u00e3o dizer igual, ao Kanata. Por\u00e9m poderia ter mais,pois \u00e9 como se o problema com os besouros dem\u00f4nios tivesse acabado ali.\\n\\n\r\nAprender com esse anime? Bom n\u00e3o sei se eu aprendi algo, mas percebi que ser o centro das aten\u00e7\u00f5es pode ser bom, no caso do Kanata se ele quisesse poderia simplesmente receber virar de um \"traidor\" para um her\u00f3i. Mas n\u00e3o ele preferiu o anonimato, mostrando sua maturidade, e isso foi o que me inspirou a ver o anime.\\n\\n\r\nO que eu menos gostei, foi da personalidade de uma das antagonistas, tentando agir como uma deusa, n\u00e3o sei definir aquela personalidade mas sei que era muito enjoativo, e a Yuri, que aparentemente \"gostava\" do Kanata por\u00e9m vivia chamando ele de \"traidor\".\\n\\n\\n\r\n[English-EUA] I took time to watch more, honestly it was not bad, but it was not good either.\\n\r\nI found the anime good on the subject of the protagonist, with a very good personality. But the other personalities like the staff of the E601 team who only have personalities clich\u00e9s.\\n\r\nI found the anime very poorly explained in many issues, as the Kanata has that \"special\" power. The anime did not have a very cool ending, of course it was as if it had finished an arc that is the evolution of the team E601, along with that guy obsessed with Yuri, who gained a similar power not to say the same, to the Kanata. But there could be more, for it is as if the problem with the beetle devils had ended there.\\n\\n\r\nLearn from this anime? Well I do not know if I learned anything but realized that being the center of attention might be good, in the case of Kanata if he wanted he could simply get turned from a \"traitor\" to a hero. But he did not prefer anonymity, showing his maturity, and that's what inspired me to see the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I least liked, was the personality of one of the antagonists, trying to act like a goddess, I do not know how to define that personality but I know it was very nauseating, and Yuri, who apparently \"liked\" Kanata but lived by calling him \"traitor \".",

            "content": "Relatively moderate review this time, nothing too fancy but I do think this anime deserves a review since it did intrigue me quite a bit! I'm doing a review on Sky Wizard's Academy, an anime based around a protagonist, Kanata Age, that has recently been black listed a traitor due to his inactivity with his duty to protect his home of Mistgun. In his blacklisting, he winds up becoming an instructor for a group of misfit students that are considered the lowest of the students, as they still have yet to win a single match against any of their opponents.\r\nSo I'm going to start withthe story as it is probably the only thing actually holding this anime together unfortunately. While I really enjoyed the story and the way the plot held itself together, I feel like I know nothing that I want to know. I never really received any answers for anything that I might have been curious about or really had any part of where these antagonistic beings called the \"Devil Beetles\" came from, which honestly leaves me a little sad and truly desiring more from the story. In all honestly, as much as I feel like I didn't learn anything, I do feel extremly held together by the lack of information making me want to create my own story line, which, I do feel saved this anime significantly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSounds check out next as I feel they did alright with the voice actors, as I feel like I couldn't really put any other voices to fit the characters better than they do. I guess the lack of actual emotion in the anime makes it hard for me to feel that they truly fit does play a factor into it but I think they did alright portraying the character they way they were meant to be heard. As for action scenes and all the sounds that follow a sword and a rifle, they failed. Nothing sounded like it fit or didn't even make a sound at all which made following the fighting rather difficult. The intro song was amazing. I never skipped as it always made me feel ready and wanting to get the anime going. The outro on the other hand, I skipped every time after the first episode. I didn't really enjoy it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWell, now with the animation, I don't think it did too bad but the CGI was awful. Nothing connected, every movement was way to stiff, and all the colors changed during the switches. And than to try and counter this issue, they stopped using CGI and just made the fights really slow and rather actually quite dull using just the normal animation. It went from bad to worse. But hey, I guess all the looks of the characters weren't bad. I did like their models and enjoyed their hairstyles and the look of their eyes quite a bit.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was pretty foul.  While every character learned and progressed forward, it looked like they were just shooting in the dark and getting lucky. Nothing really connected to me to say that it made sense. Harder than that, none of the characters had back stories besides Misora, so it really felt forced and just pulled together. Nothing really impressive to say about it, sorry to say.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDespite this, I did enjoy the anime. I don't really understand why I enjoyed it so much, maybe it just had a feel of something I enjoyed in the past, but never the less, I did enjoy it. Watching the characters struggle and try to figure out what was going on made it a pretty good story, as rough as it was and since the characters didn't really have their backstories, maybe I enjoyed the mystery of trying to see how they all played out. I will end my rating with a 5/10 solely as an enjoyment rating to factor it out to something decent. It may not really be worth a watch, but I think it had promise.\\n",

He is known as the \"Blacke Master Swordsman\" and the elite ace of the S128 special team, however he is now despised as the \"traitor of the special team\".\r\nOne day, he is assigned as the instructor of E601, a team who has sufferedten consecutive defeats.\\n\r\nThe three girls in this team are: Whitale Misora, Eisenach Lecty, and Flamel Rico; each with one or two peculiar behavior habits.\\n\\n\r\nGosh, that summary explained literally EVERYTHING about this anime.\\n\r\nBasically humankind was driven off the land and thus came in the use of wizards. The prodigy; Kanata is branded as a traitor before the anime started and he is placed as an instructor to the weakest team at the academy.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the reason behind why Kanata is known as a traitor is not specifically known until later on in the series (even then it might be a bit confusing but there are hints in the anime) but even then there are no specific explanations, only theories.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing I didn't like was the ending.\\n\r\nIt just stopped out of nowhere and I'm wondering if there are plans for a second season; if there is then the ending is appropriate but still a little disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully there is a second season which goes into more depth about Kanata.\\n\r\nOther than that the series is enjoyable and I would recommend it to people who like fantasy I guess. Even for fantasy lovers I think this anime will be hard to finish cause the story is somewhat lacking and I don't even want to start with an ending.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully my questions will be answered in the OVA that is too be released.\\n",

Only the character design was pretty decent and I bet that's what attracts the mass audience at first along with the big oppai loli. Seriously, the devil beetles are pretty much just flying around and not doing anything and during fight scenes, tsundere redhead just goes 'ahhhh' and fires a laser beam from her sword and ends the fight. As for the other characters,apparently the animators just drag the character across the background and make explosion circles appear. Really really bad fight scenes. The whole circle explosion thing is so overused. Seriously don't watch this anime because there's no redeeming factor at all. I don't get how people think that this is good at all much less a 10/10 rating. As to why I even watch this if I thought it was so bad, well I'm one of those people that have to finish an anime even if it's bad cause I dislike dropping an anime halfway.",

Seems like a copy pasted ripoff from almost any similar anime that came in the past years (and in case you missed it, there where a ton of those). Humanity is trying to survive against a mysterious entity (in this case bugs). Again, horribly overused, and unlike some other titles, doesn't add a single new thing to the formula.\r\nSound and art - Pretty good, not outstanding or special in any way, but good looking and pleasant to watch\r\nCharacters- Now here we get to the really bad part. All the characters in this show are so unoriginal, predictable andpretty much copy - pasted, that its simply disgusting to watch, this show makes you feel you're rewatching another one. There is a bit of an exception... The so to say ray of light in this series - the protagonist. While he's also not original in any way, he's the only one that actually has at least a tiny bit of depth and invokes any interest at all, keeping this anime watchable. Sadly, the anime is not focused on him in the slightest to the very end.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, its been a while since i saw something so shallow. The only messages in this anime sends is how awesome the power of friendship and cooperation is, and \"never give up!\", and not like that one is anything new, i personally got sick of hearing it over ten years ago when i was a kid watching power rangers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe final verdict - 5/10, and that's just mostly for the decent art, I do NOT recommend this show to anyone, especially those of you that are over 14.",

This is what I call the \"Battle Harem Flavor of the Season\". Almost every season, we see a Battle Harem Anime. The plots are generally similar and characters are often completely Identical. Absolute Duo, Blade Dance of the Elementalers, Infinite Stratos, the list goes on and on. If you've seen any of these anime, you know what I'm talking about. \r\nKuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan is one of these anime, but unlike the anime mentioned above, this fails to bring anythingto the table.\\n\\n\r\nPlot 3/10: Humanity has been forced to live in floating cities because their world has been taken over by monsters. Nothing new here. Seen it before. With this Summer season playing host to God Eater, this plot has already been covered, we don't need two anime with the same story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 4/10: This is probably the worst part of the show, particularly the fight scenes. The animation is poor, and battle scenes are poorly executed and are not exciting\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10: The Sound is Average at  best. The soundtrack is unexciting and does often not fit with what is going on on Screen. The Opening is pretty good, but is not particularly exciting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10: Stereotypical and Bland characters do not help this anime. The characters are essentially direct clones of  Blade Dance of the Elementalers. They certainly bland and can even be annoying at times.\\n\\n\r\n\"Plot\": More \"Plot\" could actually increase my enjoyment of this anime. It would break the Monotony of this bland anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10: I'm not saying not to watch this, but don't expect anything new or particularly exciting. \\n",

While watching this I had such a strong feeling of deja vu I had to make sure I hadn't already seen it 3 times. In the end it was because of bad writing.\r\nStory: 5\r\nRaise your hands if you have heard this one before. An OP protagonist who is looked down upon joins a class in a battle school where people have mystic powers and fight giant CG monsters. But this time heis the teacher. Isn't that a twist! There was one interesting point to the plot where people who die with this power are forgotten. It could have been a really cool addition to the rest of the cliche story. Instead they use it as a small plot point in one of the girls story. Then it might as well have died itself, with how they forgot about it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nPart of me wants to rate this part a 4. All I look for in these shows are cool looking fight scenes. This show doesn't even deliver that. But it is still a 5 because the art is thoroughly average. The CG is bad, but that is to be expected. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nI hate the backing soundtrack, and the OP and closing are easy to skip. The rest is pretty normal. The seiyu sound just like you expect them to. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nAll the characters are one dimensional. They are likable due to the familiarity cliches bring me. But they do nothing themselves to make me like them. To someone who hasn't watched much anime I am sure they would find a few of the characters endearing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this anime in the slightest. On an objective level, this show is not as bad as many of the other reviews make it sound. It is average, a copy of other shows that really are not that much better than it. Many of the reviews I have read rate it low because it is exactly like others of this genre. But that just makes it average, not bad. Like I said previously, when I watch these shows all I want are cool fight scenes and easy romance. This show does neither. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:5\\n\r\nThere is no net gain or loss from this show. It is the same show you have seen plenty of times. Neither bad nor good. The more anime you watch, the more these types of shows will make you angry, but if you are at a stage in life where you are fine with mediocrity you can watch this and won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "I gave it a lot of thought wondering about why studios always have that one anime that is like 50 others before it and while the premise and some parts are different we have a production of a generic harem story per se. Answer it isn't for the long-time anime watchers but for new people breaking into anime from the start, well that's my opinion but onto the review.\r\nThe story setting is similar to 3 maybe 4 other animes or plots I've read in my time as a watcher, it's put together differently but this is a post-world, magic, monster-threat, weapons combat, school-life series. Thestory is set as a failure team in danger of disbanding gets assigned a new instructor, disgraced former ace fighter Kanata Age. Kanata then proceeds to use unorthodox methods to fix each of the girls flaws that prevent  them from being successful as a team despite their great potential. I won't say this story isn't unheard of or repetitive but we rarely get a teacher MC so it boosts it score a little.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and animation is decent the CG goes well together but the monsters are generic and all CGed and it isn't nearly God-tier animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is solid, the  opening and ending have not complaints, I suppose the one thing that annoyed me was the battle music but it wasn't that annoying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, let's start off with the failure team E601 our underdogs, Misora, tsundere red-head with a noble goal later crush on Kanata which goes unnoticed, Lecty ultra shy dual swordswoman, and Rico god-tier narcissist and master sniper with a inferiority complex to her sister. We also have Kanata's previous team, Chloe miss kind-hearted, and Lloyd other guy who is in the background, 3rd is Yuri, Kanata's original protege and while angry with him harbors deep love to him. Finally we have  our hero Kanata, known as \"traitor\" and \"Chronos\" is assigned as a teacher to E601 on Chloe's request. Kanata is probably the most fun of the series not because he is funny himself but how he trolls the other characters so well, and still fulfills his job as a teacher. To be honest I'm sure he keeps trolling Yuri too because no one is that dense, I hope. (honestly I never got the harem vibe because there is next to no romantic development between Kanata and the girls in any sense that I can see, well he does serve as a moral support but no eros or romantic stuff maybe Yuri or Misora but I'm not sure with how Kanata trolls them too) \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment well I enjoyed the series because of the trolling done by Kanata, but people will look at the series and see it as generic and it is but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy it. Well whatever. Combat scenes are good (some actual tactics involved like bare minimum), development of characters is okay, and the premise is  decent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a 6.5 but since we don't have 6.5 I rounded up, still if people are tired of repeated generic harem anime then the score is 4 and don't watch you will hate.",

            "content": "\"How to butcher a decent novel\", by Diomedea.\r\nKuusen Madoushi Kohousei no Kyoukan has all the traits to be considered another light novel adaptation from the pile. The synopsis is generic and has already been used (Chrome Shelled Regios meets Zettai Karen Children), there is a protagonist who used to be the strongest and has fallen out of grace for unclear reasons, surrounded by a group of girls, fighting against a relentless enemy that has apparently no reasoning capacity. However, it excels at doing the average.\r\nThe plot's intention is basically watching how our fallen elite re-educates the three little misfits. However, their personalities are not simplewhims fixable by falling for a guy voiced by Matsuoka, although there are some times where the magical wand of plot comes in to save the day, the methods are as uncommon as you would expect, and hit the root of problems that are quite realistic for a magic-based series. Of course, all in time to avoid getting the team dissolved or Kanata's ass kicked out of the corps, but then again, which series has actually made an ultimatum and taken it to the last consequences?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters start as pretty basic. We have Kanata Age, who falls from glory because he betrayed his original team, but still maintains a bit of arrogance and aloofness, Misora, who is a no-brain tryhard, Lecty, who is extremely timid, and Rico who is a narcissistic lazy girl. I will avoid their backgrounds in order to spoil as little as possible, but they have their reasons. Their interactions are what makes the show attractive, most times comical, a few other times emotional. They eventually grow and understand where their fault lies in the continuous defeat streak that their team is suffering, showing their hidden potential (like all underdog MC on Light Novels).\\n\\n\r\nI saved the art and music for last, and here is where I get to shoot the fish in the barrel. Diomedea is a guaranteed disaster as a studio. In the summer season they could use the lack of sufficient resource allocation as an argument since they were doing four series at the same time (utter insanity in my opinion), but here, they only had this. The animation is disastrous, how do you entrust a series with flying people (which means lots of fluid movement is necessary) to these guys? The first episodes, they used badly made CG representations of the characters, which were barely bearable. Eventually they didn't even have enough money for that, so they started sliding fixed images across the screen (check the first 30 seconds of the opening to have an idea). And for the last few episodes, it seems that their only computer with flash installed broke down, since they resorted to teleporting, Dragon Ball fight style. Then the series has its assortment of wonky faces, mismatched limbs and disappearing debris, but that is par for the course, not even ufotable gets away from that. The music does not coordinate with the moments, hitting an opening-like theme on a happy atmosphere, plus the opening and ending are not too good either.\\n\\n\r\nKuusen Madoushi Kohousei no Kyoukan is not an exceptional masterpiece, nor does it pretend to be one. It sticks to the generic and does its best from there. Then came Diomedea and broke everything with their wrecking ball-like quality. If you are searching for something innovative or mentally challenging, this is not for you, this is just some good moments and growth (and a bit of fanservice, especially on the first episodes). Since I am a sucker for growth and second chances stories, it gets an overall 6, that could have been one or two points higher if any other studio had put their hands on this.",

            "content": "Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan also known as \"Sky Wizard Academy\" is one of those shows even though it had its clear problems it had obvious potential to be a enjoyable anime.\r\nNow it was never going to be one of these shows that changed anime or that everyone was talking about but it could have been enjoyable atleast.\r\nI say couldve because by the 12th episode it becomes a complete mess with unanswered questions, inconsistent pacing and random character personality changes.\r\nI really wanted to like this show and if it became a harem or ecchi show like infinite stratos which also had potential but never actedon it then i couldve  atleast gone and given it credit for those kind of fans but as it is now i simply canT.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nFor the story im going to give it a 2 because it is just a half assed mess you can tell had next to a non existent budget.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows around a group of character who are known as Sky Wizards training to be in a competitive tournament despite having never won a match.\\n\r\nIf the story was just this then it could have been forgiven somewhat but no the decided to add in such subplots as the teacher having a redemption story, demonic beetle robots and a serial killer.\\n\\n\r\nIf these subplots were more fleshed out and it was a longer series giving every story element enough episodes to be focused on it would be fine but they just crammed way too much into 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThere are just way too many plotholes and obvious questions that never get answered such as what are the devil beetles?\\n\r\nWhy do they keep attacking?\\n\r\nWhere did they come from?\\n\\n\r\nQuestions like this are never acknowledged let alone answered.\\n\r\nMaybe its better in the source material but as for the anime the story is one of the worst ive ever seen aside from Kill La Kill.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow the art for this series is decent i suppose, i mean it could use some work in some areas but its not horrendous and its atleast some what consistent.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are done pretty well once again nothing amazing but good enough i suppose for a small series like this.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that is done really well however is the backgrounds.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are so good that it almost gives off a stark contrast to the rest of the animation and designs.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for this is actually pretty well done once again nothing jaw dropping but certainly the best part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are pretty well done being slightly above average quality and the voice acting is entertaining to listen to while being cast pretty well in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nYou also have the opening which besides looking like any AMV you can find on youtube is pretty good and fits the shows feel of fast paced action.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nNow to talk about the characters.\\n\r\nMost of these characters are pretty forgetable however they do have enough features to make them stand out.\\n\\n\r\nYou have Kanata who is the teacher who has a stigma of being a traitor for running away from a big fight in the past despite being one of the strongest characters in the show via kirito deus ex machina secret ability.\\n\\n\r\nYou also have my favorite character Rico who is so full of herself that its actually pretty entertaining to watch her on screen because she is one of those characters that would normally be annoying but is so innocent and naive that it comes off as almost adoreable since nothing she says is true she just believes it is.\\n\\n\r\nFinally you have Misora whos backstory actually has the best story element of this entire series because it does raise alot of good questions about life and death.\\n\r\nYou see Misoras mother was a famous wizard like she wants to be however at a young age her mother went on a mission and died.\\n\r\nThis would be traumatizing enough for a child but to add onto this because she was a sky wizard anybody who is normal forgets that she ever existed.\\n\r\nThis includes her own father.\\n\\n\r\nSo as you can imagine this raises alot of questions on what our characters leave behind when they die and whether or not their actions will have any effect on the world or if they are just wasting their time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nNow for this most important question, did i enjoy it?\\n\r\nHonestly i kind of did, dont get me wrong this show is pretty bad in terms of story telling and animation but the characters do somewhat redeem the show to a point but not enough to give it a high score or even recommend it to anybody.\\n\\n\r\nIt just had so much potential that it never came close to acheiving so thats why im giving it a 4/10",

            "content": "To start of this review I will quickly go over the setting which in simple terms in about humanity fighting an on-going threat of some sorts which is nothing new, in this case it is the Devil Beetles which are magical mechanical insects that what to exterminate humanity for an unknown reason, in which in response young people are trained in the art of killing them using a variety of tools in a highschool setting. \r\nNothing really new there, there are thousands of other anime done in a similar fashion, so all I can really say is the setting is mediocre at best and doesn'treally catch the eye much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for the story which is written just above; that follows Kanata Age becoming an instructor for fireteam E601; know in a nutshell this story is highly predictable and overall is quite boring if taken seriously however if it is watched purely for entertainment can become a nice popcorn show if you want to unwind for a few hours.\\n\\n\r\nBut as well as having a highly predictable plot the show has some really bad moments with various other sub plots being thrown in at various places that make the show into a complete mess, so much that kept forgetting what was happening as I progressed from one episode to the next. And with each of these sub plots there are more and more questions to be answered about the setting, that are never answered as well many relationships that are just left with no conclusion by the end of the show; speaking of the end of the show, there is no ending as once again it just ends on a cliff-hanger with various things unanswered, and is anything but satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nNext is the animation which once again can be described as mediocre at times and really bad at others, one such example is the main enemy themselves, the Devil Beetles which are completely CGI, that not only looks bad but doesn't fit nicely with the regular animation, resulting in it standing out badly. As for the regular animation as said before is highly average but it does quite poorly during the shows supposedly high points which are the fight scenes as they feel slow and out of place. \\n\\n\r\nThirdly I would like to talk about the soundtrack used within the show, for which firstly I'm going to say is mediocre at best, even though it does fit with the show well, its just not a good soundtrack and I found it be hardly noticeable so much as that the average viewer won't notice it unless they try to seek it out. In a similar fashion the Opening & Ending to the show are nothing to talk about as the Opening while fitting the show well and opening animation well, it just doesn't have a good enough impact to make you come back without skipping over it; this can also be said about the Ending which while a good song doesn't have a good enough impact to make you stay for the full thing. \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally the lowest point of the show, it's characters who are the run of the mill stereo typical rom-com harem characters. Starting with the main character Kanata Age, an overpowered dense high-schooler, with no interesting character attributes, a boring personality, no development and average design, making him a mediocre MC. Next is the four girls who are Misora Whitale, Lecty Eisenach & Rico Flamel, who are Kanta's fire team, that have a slight better score than Kanata having some development & better designs but still have the same old personalities seen in other shows; such as the Tsundere, the clumsy girl and the know it all which also applies to the 4th girl Yuri Flostre who has a good design but has a boring personality and no development. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast are not even worthy of mention and are highly forgettable aside from the odd one or two who help move the plot in a different direction. \\n\\n\r\nOverall if you have nothing else to watch, give this a go; however if otherwise give this one a skip.",

            "content": "NOTICE: Keep in mind that I do not have high standards for watching anime. It's going to take a lot of negative aspects to convince me that the anime is second-to-decent or bad or in some cases, so bad I gotta go to bathroom for a long time. :))))\r\nOh hey, you just read the disclaimer and you're in luck, because this anime is one of those bad animes! First of all, this is my first review, so wish me luck, and I'm super late to the party. I apologize :( Anyways, let's get with it!\r\nSTORY: 3 - So the main story of this anime iswhat I consider the generics/commons. There's these unknown enemies known as blahblahblah and select people train to be these fighters to fight them off to save the city. Sounds like a couple animes you probably know right? Yeah, this type of story is bland and boring if you don't modify or throw in some plot twists. While watching this anime, I could see that some of the story was progressing, like training the failing E601 team to become better wizards. However, the plot shifted to a tournament? It's good to have some augments that don't interfere with the main storyline as much but it directly shifted to the point of the tournament and the monsters, known as \"beetles\" didn't really matter until the couple last episodes. Basically, generic story is generic, and the main plot was stalled. I didn't enjoy that.\\n\\n\r\nART: 4 - The animation is ehhhhh, but I expected something more better since this is 2015. The animation looks like it was from the 2009s or lower. Heck, I think the animes from that time had even better animation than this! The fighting scenes didn't really leave an impact on me, as everything looked so boring. The CG used looked so bad that my eyes were burning (not literally), and overall didn't provide a smooth experience. Given all this, you could tell that the studio had a low budget, or they were simply lazy. Come on, you guys could've done better.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 6 - The sound is the only thing that's good in my opinion. Nothing felt out of place, the sounds matched and blended in the situation given, and I liked Iori Nomizu's performance of the opening. The ending sort of moved me as well. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 5 - Characters received a 5 because they do variate. You've got the generic main character, Kanata, who is an excellent ace, but also a traitor. Anime like this these days tend to have a main character who is undefeated, or a traitor. We have Lecty, a girl whose shyness gets in the way of her pride and her skills, Misora, a girl who tends to not listen to anybody and has a goal to be like her mother, and Rico, a girl that thinks she is a goddess of beauty. I did see some character development throughout the anime, like Lecty overcoming her shyness and Misora improving herself to be like her mother. All in all, characters were fine, but not great.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 3 - If you have high standards for watching anime, you can immediately forget this. It will not appeal to your expectations at all. If you're a casual or don't really give a crud about any anime you watch, be my guest and take a look!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 2 - So, overall this anime was garbage. I sort of regret giving it a shot. Story was painful and terrible, as well as the animation. The sounds and characters were the only factors that were decent. As I said, if you watch any kind of anime, no matter what it is, feel free to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nThat wraps up on my first ever review! I don't know if I did well explaining the pros and cons but whatever xD. Man, that was a pain to type.\\n",

In this case, i dont have to worry about that becouse you see, there is nothing to spoil here becouse there are no story whatsoever to speak of.\r\nStory:\r\nKanata Age, your swordsman main protagonist is recruited by the academy to train 3 girls to fight the big ass bugs for a reason we never learn, i guess they want to conquer the world or something. So thats it, nothing morenothing less, you wont see more progress in the story department. I could have easily copied MALs own summery but that would be cheap. So if you can accept that \"training program\" stuff then yeah, that your story. The anime does not lie to you about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nDid i just say characters? well sorry, not in this one. The 3 girls he trains is your typical harem trophes you have seen a million times before. Move on.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming quality is its looks, good looking girls, your typical guy with a big fat sword\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nI dont hate this show, i just dont like it. There is nothing for me to hate, there is no plot advancement whatsoever so bitching about a plot that does not exist is kind of hard. Sky wizards academy is just stupid and it does not need to even exist becouse it does not contribute to anything.",

            "content": "- Hello, guys, finally my review of Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei in Kyoukan, starting with the story that although interesting, unfortunately was not very well executed, besides having several problems of script and some exaggerations in some scenes, and unfortunately this bothers, but despite of all that, I still liked the story, it's a very good story for someone who is looking for something to just pass the time, but it was a story that had a lot of potential but unfortunately was wasted.\r\n- On the technical part, which is one of the strongest points of the work, the technical part is simply excellent, the animationis very good, but what stands out even is the look that is simply magnificent, are firm features and vibrant colors; already the direction does not stand out much, not bad, just does the basics.\\n\\n\r\n- Now about the soundtrack, which is another strong point of the work, the soundtrack is very good and very well used, as well as the sound effects, I loved the way they used, it helped to give more impact to the different scenes, in short, without doubts one of the strongest points of the work.\\n\\n\r\n- About the characters, without doubt is the strongest point of the work, the cast is simply excellent, are very charismatic characters and well developed, especially the protagonists, but the highlight is the main heroines: Lecty, Misora \u200b\u200band Rico, both are extremely charismatic, and have an excellent development during the series, but the secondary characters are also very good, in short, the cast of Kuusen Madoushi is simply excellent.\\n\\n\r\n- Conclusion, Kuusen Madoushi has some problems such as: history with potential lost, script problems, doubtful direction, plus some exaggerations in some scenes, the series has several problems but also has several good points such as a great technical part, a excellent soundtrack, in addition to very charismatic characters, in short, Kuusen Madoushi is like any other anime, has its positives and negatives, but in general, it is an anime that I liked a lot, and highly recommend to anyone looking for a simple anime to pass the time \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc90 !! \\n\\n\r\n- My favorite song by Kuusen Madoushi \ud83d\udc96: www.youtube.com/watch?v=bb3868XJmWw\\n\\n\r\n- My page about animes on facebook\ud83d\udc9e: www.facebook.com/pg/AnimeSpaceBR.050/posts/?ref=page_internal\\n\\n\r\n\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc9c !!",

The Combat, Romance, Comedy, Antagonist, Protagonist, and last but not least the Plot were all the anime equivalent to stale cardboard, even the OP and ED were sub par. The only upside about this anime is that it has good Character art style and has some good voice actors (even if they got shitty scripts). I don't know the first thing about making an anime and what goes into doing it, but I think that they were either lacking inthe essentials of creating the anime or just lazy. Not the worst anime I've seen but it's far from the best. Between Complete Garbage and Best Anime, ill give it an OK at best. I only watched it all because it was Semi-enjoyable. Also, I feel really bad for Yuri since Kanata is either the most dense MC ever, or is just a jack ass, but I'm going with the latter.\\n\\n",

Add to that the girls are cute, have super powers and have to battle other students. So when it comes time for the annual school battle, the girls as expected compete and prove to everyone they aren't the losers everyone thought they were. Brilliant, seen heaps of anime just like it andloved most of them.\\n\\n\r\nHowever in this waste of a time anime, instead of devoting the main portion of the series to the tournament and the fight scenes (which is the best part of these types of anime), they only show the very first match and then in the next episode jump straight to the tournament final. WTF... How can you leave out the battles, the hard fought victories, the pulling a win from the jaws of defeat???\\n\r\nThere was hardly any time spent on training episodes either and even though this series was only 12 eps, they managed to add generic space filler episodes like the girls working in a maid cafe.\\n\\n\r\nVery annoyed at this series as it could have been so much better. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like the magic/fighting school genre anime, you might like to check out these.\\n\r\nRakudai Kishi no Cavalry - 8/10\\n\r\nSeiken Tsukai no World Break - 7/10\\n\r\nGakusen Toshi Asterisk - 6.5/10\\n\r\nAbsolute Duo - 6/10\\n\r\nHundred - 6/10\\n\\n",

Not everything needs an explaination. That's what makes this different. (See next paragraph) It doesn't drag on like a b*!$*! explaining, backstorying, flashbacking like crazy. Sure those are good, but not in everything all the time. Lets be honest, this is better than your normal action movie... obviously not as realistic though.\\n\\n\r\nFor those that don't finish the anime and say everything is unexplained with no character development obviously never finished the anime. Those get answered and developed along the story and come together at the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nBy the way, the intro should give you enough backstory anyway and the backstories of most characters were shown.\\n\r\nThe haters that say there's no development just hate the cliche characters, there's definitely character development.\\n\r\nI don't hate cliche/unoriginal stuff, but rather just dislike them.\\n\r\nIn the end characters were more closer, feelings told, mysteries revealed, and friendships renewed.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters individual development were very solid and improving in character without drastically changing the core characteristics. That's better than a character who changes what he/she is on a whim because it appeals better. This was more solid than more popular.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nToo many people are salty.\\n\r\nForget all the cliche and story and look at just the art. It's not amazing, but neither is it absolute crap. Get ahold of yourselves people, because you hated the stories and characters so much doesn't make the art absolute garbage.\\n\r\nSaying the art in this sucks destroys many popular anime too, chill.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I enjoyed this more than many other anime believe it or not, tonnes more than Steins;Gate for example. (Ready for the hate)\\n\r\nBut don't get me wrong, this anime annoyed me too with character unrealistic stupidity and stubbornness. But then again, this is more of a \"throw me some action less story, idc if it's cliche\" anime/movie/series which many people enjoy. (Obviously not many in MAL or anime)\\n\\n\r\nIn many aspects this is a better anime than many imo, it's just cliche with action that you don't have to figure out.\\n\r\nChill people.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for my score on this, it's overall a 7ish all lost to clicheness and other minor things.\\n\r\nIt's better nailing a cliche movie/series etc. than trying to be interesting and turning \"meh\" (Still try different things though)\\n\\n\r\nExtra bit:\\n\r\nShould end here. I don't usually say that as I usually want more, but the anime wrapped up nicely so I don't see a point in a S2.",

Kanata and his former teammates are great, especially Kanata who always \"forgets\" to tell his plans and ideas. His background is actually pretty complicated but the show won't tell you what exactly happened so you have to think but you can find it out pretty easly.\r\nThe animationis decent but in the final round in the tournament it gets really bad for some reason.\\n\r\nThis is an anime where you have an overpowered MC but he doesn't show his full potential.

Through a series of team building exercises that last the whole show, the characters marginally improve. This improvement is barely worth mentioning and effectively changes nothing in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? There is no enjoyment. Action is terrible. Story is awful. Characters are pathetic. This show offers nothing for anyone to enjoy. It's not even an interesting train wreck. Watching this show for the sole purpose of mocking it is a waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nI don't say this often, but please believe me. This show should not be viewed by anyone. Ever.

            "content": "This is basically a story about an overpowered MC with a messiah complex teaching 3-4 anime stereotypes how to fight lame-looking monsters. There is a little PG fanservice here and there.\r\nStory:\r\nA misunderstood MC is placed in charge of misunderstood students. Throughout the series the MC holds a smug 'knew-it-all-along' attitude, which gets under (my) skin. It cannot be said that he grows as a person during the story, and only the last two-three episodes show any real character development in his students. I'm sure next season they'll be back to square one though. I guess I should note that I say that there are threestereotypes, but I think two of them are really common. The third girl thinks she is a goddess and is above training, which is pretty original to me. That being said, knowing that that's what she is, you will now be able to guess most, if not all of the things that she will say and do during the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(I like to know annoying quirks common to series before I start watching them, so here they are some listed out.)\\n\r\nCliches\\n\r\n- Mascot Character: there was no annoying all-knowing talking pet in this series. The MC did a pretty good job of taking its place though.\\n\r\n- Hidden Power: the main character did have a hidden power, but not in the traditional sense of a main character suddenly discovering he's special and while he's weak now, he'll be the strongest someday in the future.\\n\r\nFan Service\\n\r\n- Magical Falling (somehow end up in the 69 position or groping the girl's chest): I don't remember there being any of this.\\n\r\n- Perfect? Timing (opening up the door on someone changing): There was a lot of this.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe monsters looked lame and the MC looked lame when he powered up to fight them. The characters generally had fluid motion, although I can think of some exceptions. Other than that, I should note that the anime does not have a 1990s-style animation to it. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSound doesn't typically affect my enjoyment of a series too much, although if I really enjoy the soundtrack, it can have a +1 effect on my overall rating of the series. The soundtrack for this series was pretty nondescript in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n(Sound Pt 2)Voice Acting:\\n\r\nFor voice acting, one of the few things that bother me in a series is when female characters have masculine voices or male characters have excessively feminine voices. That was not a problem in this series; however, I should note that since I found the dialogue and plot to be corny, I can't really bring myself to say that the voice acting was good. I guess I should also note that there's not a lot of English in the series, so there aren't many (if any) places for Japanese actors to butcher English pronunciation.\\n\\n\r\nOther:\\n\r\nThe MC is a bad OP character, since he gets his butt kicked and doesn't really show a lot of speed/power, particularly towards the end. Now usually, you'd like an OP MC to look cool when they go into their super-sayan equivalent. He does not. The main character looks as though the animation studio was on a low budget when they got to make him fight hard. To be fair, throughout the series, but especially towards the end the enemies they fight make it look like the story was written for 10 year olds. Maybe it was, in which case if you're a preteenager or child or want to watch something for that age range please ignore my review.",

Here are my reasons why.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nIt is really hard to predict where the plot will go until a certain point in the anime. Even then the plot presented potential story lines that would be way better than what the producers went with. The plot still leaves many things unexplained, and as much as I would like to divulge on the plot holes, that would be spoiler territory.But if you somehow decide to give this show a go, be aware that the plot is most likely the weakest part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nI would have scored this section a 5/10, but I'm a sucker for interesting looking weapons. Although some weapons(mainly minor characters) were super generic-looking and it made me wonder why our main cast(who are basically the worst of the worst, minus main male lead) got such cool looking weapons. The art style is very generic in all other cases, what was given got the job done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nThe sound is completely average, but nothing stands out really(minus the opening song, but that is my personal preference). Can't really say much because most of the sound was forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:6/10\\n\r\nThe MC is a very generic, OP character for no reason but he had the potential for development but that was left as a plot hole that really bugs me. What pushed this rating to a 6/10 was the development of our main female cast. All three of them made some progress from when they started, albeit some can say they have seen development similar to the three characters.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:5/10\\n\r\nI liked the art style, esp. Lecty, who was by far my personal 'best girl'. But that is completely from opinion. It's entirely average with ups and downs and most of the show got predictable.  \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When you make a fantasy anime, the expectance of one is to intoxicate the viewer to be pulled and drawn into the show that you're watching.  So, when you fail do things such as ADHERING TO YOUR BASE PLOT, then you a problem on your hands.  Kuusen Madoshi Kouhosei no Kyoukan, everyone.\r\nStory: The story of Kuusen Madoushi is well, quite a mashup.  Humanity has been pushed onto the edge of near extinction.  The world has been overrun by a threat called the Devil Beetles, to the point that humanity had to relocate up into the air in floating cities.  There,students go to Magic High School in order to train to become sky wizards in order to fight off the Devil Beetle threat.  It is here where we have Kanata Age, a Sky Wizard who is also known as a \"traitor\" amongst the sky wizards, where he is forced to teach a trio of Sky Wizard failures to greatness.\\n\\n\r\nLet me get something off my chest first.  Oh boy, another humanity pushed to the brink of near extinction to the point they have to be put into confined places to escape a threat that kills them!  Not like we haven't seen THAT twenty plus times in the past year of anime!  (Ok, rant over.)  Kuusen Madoshi is a plotline that doesn't particularly have an identity.  While completely focusing on our MC helping out the three girls that can barely use their weapons, Kuusen Madoshi completely forgets the entire plotline involving the supposed \"villains\" of the series.  This becomes a big hit on the series particularly because the entire threat doesn't even seem like a big deal in the end.  (The beetles only appeared once.)  In place of that, they change the entire focus of the series several times to the point that the entire base story becomes obsolete.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story that we did get from Kuusen Madoshi, the plotline did do a fair bit better in that sense because while following the three girls on their road to Sky Wizard greatness, there was some character development that did make the show a little more interesting.  But even with that, there were a few things even then that had aspects of plot holes since it just conveniently seemed like they were able to do something competent while screwing around for the entire time before that.  (Very cliche development, but development nonetheless.)  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Kuusen Madoshi was a story that really...wasn't concise in either way.  From a story that at face value seemed like one about people fighting off an apocalyptic threat (from beetles, no less), to one about teaching kids how to swing a sword properly, to one about a stalker, Kuusen Madoshi ended without really much resolution to any of the overarching issues and stayed within solved some of the issues that the story presented.  It was very cliche to the point that you could guess what was going to happen next, so as a result, nothing really came as a surprise.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Some character development\\n\r\n- Overused Plot idea\\n\r\n- Inconsistent with its plot\\n\r\n- Plot holes\\n\r\n- Predictable plotline\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Similarly, the characters in Kuusen Madoshi are really not anyone that is noteworthy in any way except for one character who, oddly enough for a harem anime, is the MC.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Kanata Age, the main character of this entire series.  As the aforementioned \"traitor\" to the sky wizards, Kanata is a guy that is known for being just generally lazy in nature though inversely, is oddly enough, a very good teacher.  Being put to help three misfits of the Sky Wizard Academy, Kanata spends the entire series attempting to help out these girls by teaching them the power of friendship and teamwork while also fixing up any issues about them.  He is very nonchalant about any sort of thing that goes on in the series, and always manages to keep a straight face anytime in any given situation.  He is a bit dense, and that's about as far as his character goes, but otherwise, he is probably the only good character in this series.  \\n\\n\r\nThen we have the three main girls in the series; the three failures of the Kuusen Madoshi world, Misora, Lecty, and Rico.  All three of these girls follow a different trope of anime that takes up their entire character.  Misora is the tsundere, Lecty is the shy one, and Rico is the narcissist who has a pension for calling herself a goddess every five seconds she's on screen.  They do take on the mentality of appreciating help from Kanata during the series, but aside from that, that's really all there is to their characters.  They're bland, overused, and it's to the point that you don't even want to root for them because of how they act sometimes.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, we have Yuri, a girl who is known as Kanata's first disciple and kouhai.  Yuri is the other tsundere in the series and honestly, doesn't really make sense as a character.  The tsundere quality in her is so extreme to the point that it really doesn't make sense what her motive for doing anything really is.  She obviously like Kanata, but tries to get rid of him through indirect means which honestly, is so conflicting my head hurts.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for side characters, the rest of the cast if filled with a bunch of nobodies who really don't serve much for the series, with most of them not even serving as plot devices for the most part.  People like Kanata's old group, the head of the Sky wizard program, and a bunch of random girls whose names you don't even remember, don't really serve much of a purpose in this series at all.  The only one in this side cast that actually mattered was one guy that you would never expect to be important, who eventually, turned out to be very important, for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent Harem MC  (This honestly surprised me)\\n\r\n-  Less than decent harem girls\\n\r\n-  Side characters didn't serve much purpose at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for Kuusen Madoshi features two separate styles for the way the show is presented.  The normal artwork, and the CGI.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the normal animation, Kuusen Madoshi really doesn't have anything spectacular for it.  It's a very bland color scheme that lacks any sort of depth to it coupled with average animation to boot.  It's just a moderately bright color scheme and doesn't really impart anything or is special in any way.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, Kuusen Madoshi uses a lot of CGI in order to animate out the \"dangerous\" Devil beetles, as well as character models in some parts.  The CGI is very glaring and overall, quite horrifying to watch.  Because the beetles are made of CGI, the entirety of the creature looks very jarring to look at and...they don't really do anything.  The devil beetles were made to just stay stationary and fly around rather than attack or do something threatening.  It was just sad to see a someone firing shots at a seemingly unmoving and unthreatening target and it made me question how these things were threatening to begin with.  In addition, they also have several character models done in CGI form.  This occurs sometimes when the characters are flying.  Rather than animating a character in-flight part of the time, the series replaces them with complete CGI models of the characters, which creates an instant clash in quality ad overall, didn't look good in any way.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Bland animation\\n\r\n-  Poor CGI that made things look jarring\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music for this series is average at best.  There really isn't anything special about it since they're all pretty generic tracks without any memorable features to it, so there really isn't much to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: I went into this show expecting it to be bad on the basis that the synopsis was so chock full of just...things, that the series wouldn't be able to support itself.  Sadly enough though, I was right, at least for many things.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf not for Kanata's nonchalant personality and the latter half of the series focusing on a plot about a stalker, I would not have bothered to really continue this with any sort of hope.  Kanata himself is a breath of fresh air for this show because he does good while also being good.  While he is a bit of a dense character like a lot of other Harem MC's, he has enough credibility to him for him to end up becoming a half-decent character in my book.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I HATED the story and the characters.  The story was so predictable that any sort of development that happened really didn't faze me one bit.  In fact, I could guess what happens next episode without even watching it or trying.  The story never settled on one thing and that's what pissed me off as well.  It switched from devil beetles, to teaching some misfits, to finally focusing on a man who is obsessed with one of the females in the series for some reason.  It flip-flopped so much I didn't even know what I was watching anymore.  (Also, Rico is INTOLERABLE.  I am so tired of hearing her refer to herself as a goddess.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nNo, not really.  Kuusen Madoshi is a show that just goes all over the place without attempting to find a proper solution to anything it was doing really.  The characters are tired tropes from every anime ever, and the whole \"humanity under threat\" thing is an utter lie because everyone in that series was living their lives happily sipping tea or what have you without anything within a hundred miles threatening them at all.",

            "content": "Sky Wizards Academy\r\nSimilarly to how you have better things to watch, I have better things to write. So I\u2019m gonna power through this review and give you just enough information for you to know why you shouldn\u2019t watch this. \r\nVISUALS [ 3/10 ]\r\nThis show is animated... sort-of. The OP was almost good enough to be likeable, but nonetheless, the show as a whole is terrible across the board. Sky Wizards Academy has got to have some of the most generic and unspecial visual designs and artwork I\u2019ve ever seen.\r\nHowever, nothing can save this show from the incredibly inconsistent animation. From time to time, the animationsare just barely passable. Sadly, there are times where this show legitimately dips to four frame animation. Absolutely awful, in other words. SWA is filled to the brim with barely animated panning shots - doesn\u2019t really even count as animation, does it? And to put the final nail in the coffin, the characters in this show never blink, which personally creeps me out. This whole thing is a mess and not worth the breath needed to praise it. \\n\\n\r\nSETTING [ 3/10 ]\\n\\n\r\nGeneric not-really-magical city, Japan. Not at all impressive or original. Whatever good background art is in this show is drowned out by the terrible animation. Sky Wizards Academy looks exactly like any other unimpressive light novel adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nPLOT [ 2/10 ]\\n\\n\r\nIn Sky Wizards Academy, we follow four generic cute girls and one slightly older instructor dude as they do sky wizard things, which apparently consist of sitting around in classrooms half of the goddamn time. The three newbie sky patrol girls whose names I\u2019ve already forgotten take up most of the screen time. They supposedly train hard - mostly offscreen. The rest of the training shown is informal, with most tasks being actions anyone could follow - no wizardry required. The show tries to be clever several times with the different kinds of training that the instructor dude has the girls do, but it\u2019s mostly just obvious stuff that anybody could have come up with. This show has no idea what direction it should go next, which is obvious by the random, disjointed series of events that take place. There is, in fact, a plot. Expect nothing more than a barebones outline of a story that the screenwriters just ran with. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS [ 4/10 ]\\n\\n\r\nHooray for cardboard cutouts given screen time. We have main girl, who has average stats across the board with a little sprinkle of tsundere thrown in there. We have shy girl, who is good at pretty much everything but strongly lacks self confidence. We have godess girl, who is arrogant and thinks she\u2019s a goddess even though she\u2019s nowhere near hot or powerful enough. And we have love interest girl, who is in love with main guy and in the case of this show, is a tsundere. And finally: last, but certainly least, we have main guy. He\u2019s an instructor and high level sky wizard who honestly is unbelievably average other than a slight mean streak. Not an impressive main cast at all. The villain is generic, too, and you\u2019ll probably see him coming a mile away. \\n\\n\r\nPACING AND PRODUCTION [ 2/10 ]\\n\\n\r\nAs stated before, Sky Wizards Academy is quite bad in every way. No exceptions here. This show goes on for too long, plain and simple. This should have been a six episode OVA at most. The money spent on this show sincerely should have been added to a better show\u2019s budget, and a different show should have occupied this time slot of Japanese TV. By my humble opinion, SWA should not have been produced at all. There are simply better ways to spend your time and money, be it as an anime producer or a viewer. Nobody on the entire staff of this show did their job well, except for the band that did the song for the OP and the Funimation voice actors that did an ok job with a garbage script. \\n\r\nWhile we\u2019re here I\u2019ll briefly mention the soundtrack, which was boring and generic at best and weird at worst. There is a track in this show that has one or two vocalists singing a chorus that should have been edited to sound like at least ten, and it is pretty painful to listen to. It plays at some of the most dramatic moments in the show. Honestly, do I even need to keep going? The facts speak for themselves. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY [ 3/10 ]\\n\\n\r\nI could have written a better story than this, and you probably could have, too. As usual,  this is where we step into spoiler territory, so stop reading if you actually want to watch this show spoiler free. \\n\r\nThe storyline in this train wreck of a show is hard to follow, with events playing out of thin air and nothing connecting them to each other. No matter how hard Sky Wizards Academy tries, it falls flat on its face. The three girls progress by doing unusual tasks meant to teach them important life lessons. In hindsight, these scenes were probably supposed to be funny, but you get bored of bad animation and still shots so quickly that even one of my 4/10 scored shows will keep you much more entertained than this. \\n\r\nTrite bullshit is how I\u2019d describe the script of this show, and there aren\u2019t any redeeming factors here to make up for its generic attempt at a light novel adaptation, which resulted in failure. I\u2019ll just go down the list for you real quick, if you\u2019d like to read more.\\n\r\nThe fight scenes are very, very bad. Every single one of them pulls a Dragonball Z, with the characters talking more than actually fighting. The animations are rough and often off-model, and the fight direction was done by someone who has no idea how dogfights in the skies actually play out. \\n\r\nCharacters actually develop a little, which is the only thing holding up the script of the entire show. That said, the pacing is very slow and the show feels like it takes too many episodes to finish. And it doesn\u2019t end. At all. \\n\r\nThe villain is uninteresting and unoriginal, and was clearly shoehorned into the plot so there\u2019d be a villain to fight at the end. The girls just magically become stronger, without a lot of effort actually shown. There\u2019s basically no development to accompany the changes that occur rapidly to a previously terrible team. \\n\r\nThat goes for the whole show, in fact. There is no sense of time as you watch Sky Wizards Academy. You have no idea what is happening offscreen, or how long these girls have been training, or... anything, really. This show is barely interpretable as a whole, but when you look into the finer details none of it makes any sense at all. \\n\r\nI\u2019m gonna take a moment to say what I\u2019ve wanted to say this entire time: This is a piece-of-shit show, and no one should watch it. Done. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL [ 2/10 ]\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\nBelow-average production values, often with TERRIBLE animation\\n\r\nAlmost no character development\\n\r\nThis show has about twice as many episodes as it should\\n\r\nMany boring scenes\\n\r\nComedic moments aren\u2019t funny and fall flat\\n\r\nFight scenes are very, very bad\\n\r\nThere are no redeeming qualities of this show at all, other than it never outright insults me\\n\\n\r\nI strongly recommend you look elsewhere for your anime. For other shows that are similar to this one but WAY better, look to God Eater for your action fix and Majestic Prince for your action/adventure show starring high school kids. Be advised, however - the first two episodes of God Eater are a little slow, so consider skimming through them until it gets good. That\u2019ll do it for me. Good luck with your animes, and remember - you have been warned!",

            "content": "Spoilers will be included. Don't read if you don't want to be spoiled (not that there is much spoiling).\r\nStory: 2\r\nSo the story takes place in a world where humans have been overrun by a monster species, which may remind you of other titles like Shingeki no Kyojin and Black Bullet. So you would think that this story would be on humanity overcoming this invasion with parallel stories of internal fighting... Except that the premise of the monsters serve almost no purpose besides giving an excuse for aerial combat mages to exist. Besides the first episode and a very small part in the middle, the monster/insectthings have almost no screen time. Everything is based around E607 and their failures and for Kanata Age to train them into proper magicians. And here is where things go downhill.\\n\\n\r\nKanata Age is a very strong sky wizard who was once in one of the top divisions, but because he skipped out on some important events he became known as 'traitor' (what a terrible way to force a nickname). Initially it was interesting as we had no idea why he was called a traitor, which led me to believe that he was an anti-hero, but when it was explained the derogatory term felt so meaningless and forced that I felt bad for the other characters because of how corny they sounded when they used it. Kanata Age is one of those very powerful characters that we know very little about besides that he's powerful and that he holds a nonchalance attitude while being able to do everything correctly.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Kanata Age is assigned to E607 it just becomes a poorly executed fanservice series. You get locker room shots, some 'accidental' gropes, maid outfits, bunny outfits and shower scenes. Kanata assigns the girls to do some activities with the purpose of training them, but never actually explains what they're learning until they figured it out themselves... now isn't that the best method of teaching. All of this works up to the next subplot where the girls need to enter a tournament against every other division and win or they're disbanded. I expect you know the results already.\\n\\n\r\nSo here we are, at ep 11 and they've won and now there's this bad guy who's in love with Yuri and what's to kill her/rape her/convert her??? (as he infected himself with monster gene to make himself stronger) At this point I don't even know what the 'bad guy' wants to do. \\n\\n\r\nAnd ep 12 was pretty predictable from ep 11. Obviously Yuri would be the one to defeat the bad guy except it was surprising that Kanata barely did anything this episode. And for whatever reason, the bad guy is left to live and possibly repent but from the way this series concludes, it's almost as though nothing could have happened and it would be any different, since they don't move up in rank or anything.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nI found Misora and Yuri quite moeh, so that's why the art is what it is. There's nothing integrally wrong with the art, it's industry standard, but the animations with the weapons feel absolutely weak. It clearly lacks power and you can even see the lacklustre striking from the OP itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nOP and ED are pretty boring, the voices of the characters themselves are almost cliche and there's not much ambient noise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nI can't even be bothered writing out why each character is terrible so I'm just going to do a few paragraphs instead.\\n\\n\r\nSo Kanata Age is another unexplained male protagonist with great power who doesn't utilize it ever because he's too busy being nonchalant and vague... except when he needs to save a girl and get them to blush even more than they already do. And, as expected, the girls fall for him just because he exists (well two of them). \\n\\n\r\nNow here comes the E607 girls. You have the shy girl, the hot-headed girl and the arrogant girl, who can't stop repeating how she's a goddess. There are some flashbacks to explain their personalities but it's either so cliched or shallow that you don't even care why they are who they are. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are almost redundant and could probably be replaced by generic characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nOkay, so here's the biggest problem. The fighting and the talking seem to work independently of each other. When they're fighting, there's no dialogue, when they're talking, the action suddenly stops as if so everyone can listen in on what's being said. This breaks the flow of combat and it makes the whole thing flow so slowly.\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming feature this show has is its cute girls and that's basically it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nIf you're looking for fanservice, this will not sate you. If you're looking for a good story, it was left back at the introduction. If you're looking for character development, it has as much character introduction as telling your name to another person. If you're looking at how not to write a story, you've probably come to the right place.",
