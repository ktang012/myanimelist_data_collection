            "content": "\"This adaptation is like a painting, it has a beautiful frame that could be the story itself presented and maintained throughout the show, and the remarkable artistic quality of the main characters enclosed in this frame that is compared to the hypnotic and vivid sunset that fascinates our eyes and earns our total attention.\"\r\nAt first, you may be a bit skeptical after reading the summaries of this anime, the central theme is a bit unusual, a ballroom anime. Also, you can consider, a dance competition, another anime about some championships or tournaments that could be similar to any other sports anime, but you could bewrong. Ballroom e Youkoso is a fantastic adaptation that combines excellent storytelling with fabulous art design and captivates viewers by making them want more. Sadly, not all is perfect, the use of CGI could be weird and creates an ugly contrast between the characters' art and the scene background but it isn't a big issue.  \\n\\n\r\nStory 8\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has two main story arcs. The first one, the introduction of Tatara Fujita, the main character. An important fact is the display of Tatara's problems and insecurity. In addition, this arc presents the secondary characters, such as Kiyoharu, Shizuku, Mako, and Gaju. These characters enhance the narrative, the dynamics of the dance and the tournaments. They create an initial rivalry between Tatara, but the most exciting part is that they are still mates and support each other in their way. In other words, it is a healthy rivalry that is needed to help in the growth of Tatara and does not conceive the effect of a villain or a pompous competitor as we can see in the typical sports adaptations. Simultaneously, this arc reveals the differences that exist between the characters and establishes a challenging atmosphere among all of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc presents the other main character, Chinatsu Hiyama, and you can feel the progression of Tatara. Chinatsu is the opposite of Tatara. She has a dazzling personality, is rebellious and very strong. She also has a lot of experience in dance, so on many occasions, she shows her displeasure about the way of leading proposed by Tatara. She can not understand Tatara's personality. However, their relationship turned up due to Tatara's personality. For my eyes, Chinatsu is the perfect complement for Tatara.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, you can see a new secondary character, Kugimiya Masami. He is a shadowy character who could be Tatara's antagonist. For several viewers, including me, Kugimiya could fit the description of an odious competitor with some secrets. This figure is very dark and mysterious. He hates Tatara, and even the art portrays him with a faint aura. However, after a closer look, this character has been affected by several \"life\" problems that could be a reflection of Tatara if he abandoned his passion for dancing and improving. Kugimiya even compared himself to Tatara, and that bothered him more. All those elements created a beautiful story with a good rhythm, excellent narrative and with outstanding characters that can feel real.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, the standard sports anime could not cope with Ballroom and Youkoso. The series has everything: A story of high quality, with a good pacing, realistic characters, sadness, joy, need, frustration, etc. The anime emphasizes concepts such as trust between couples, their understanding, and conviction. We can observe the constant need to overcome and the hard work required to achieve a change both personally and competitively.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has two scenarios. The first, the interaction of the characters outside the \"ballroom.\" A rational world where the characters are beings with needs, problems, and feelings. The second world is inside the ballroom. A place with its own sets of rules where the score and the leader-companion relationship matter. This ambiance adds pressure and rivalry to the story, creates a dynamic where feelings of the characters bloom. Maybe my criteria could be biased since I have dance competition experience. However, seeing the relationship between partner and leader brought me many good and bad memories such as the foot pain after an event =D. To rephrase it, Tomo was able to convey those feelings to the audience, and that made me feel very happy because it stands out the realism.\\n\\n\r\nThere are still some problems with the story, however. The most visible is the lack of a real ending. Tomo fell ill, so she could not advance in the manga story. The animation exceeds the progress of manga story, so the conclusion of the adaptation could be original compared to the continuation of the manga, and it felt a bit rushed. Therefore, there may be reasonable speculation about when, or if, the date of the second season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8\\n\\n\r\nThe adaptation has a good number of characters. Perhaps the most relevant is the personality of the couples in competition. For example, the pair of Tatara in the first arc is utterly different if compared to the second arc because the couple has a distinct personality and that reflects the way the couple dance and act. For example, Mako is more delicate and shy compared to Chinatsu, who is more rebellious and strong. I'm sure that Tatara will continue to grow in the manga, and it is likely that a relationship between Chinatsu and Tatara will arise, but we can not rule out a possible attraction between Tatara and Shizuku.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters:\\n\\n\r\nTatara Fujita. He is a shy and insecure person who cares for everyone and, in particular, for his partner. Tatara was looking for a place to fit in, and the dance was a door of change for him. However, he is in constant development, his features remain constant, but explode during competitions. Maybe this character is a bit complex, but that is what makes it real.\\n\\n\r\nChinatsu Hiyama. Even if she was added halfway through the entire adaptation, her impact is gigantic. The personality of Chinatsu changed the dynamics of the narrative and directly affected Tatara's character. She is a rebel, strong, and has a lot of experience in dancing. She does not visualize Tatara as a good leader, sometimes she tries to follow him, but everything ends in constant frustration. However, she gives Tatara a chance to the point that both fight hard and evolve. It is a character with whom I feel connected, and I think there is a lot to see about its complexity.\\n\\n\r\nKiyoharu Hyoudou: You can say that he is the best dancer in the series. He is very talented and may be Tatara's main rival in the future of the story. He does not have any opponent that overcomes him. However, he helps and guides Tatara as he considers him as a rival with enormous potential and with a lot of raw skill.\\n\\n\r\nShizuku Hanaoka: She is the best companion. However, it could be said that she depends on Kiyoharu's leadership. She finds Tatara's unusual dance skills to the point that she decides to wait for his evolution and supports him. It is still too early to see if there are sentiments of her towards Tatara.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining characters are essential as well, but I don't want to prolong any further.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound 8\\n\\n\r\nBallroom e Youkoso is quite impressive regarding sound and illustrations. The art follows the dynamics of dance and is quite clean. The movement and the characters, in general, is real. Usually, the scenes make the eyes focus on the pairs because of the color palette and the details. However, a high level of detail and quality isn't maintained in the surroundings (CGI use). Besides, if the eyes change from the principal observation point, you will notice some awful disparity between the surroundings and the couples in some scenes, do not let that change your decision towards the anime. Several good animations do not have the budget to fill the whole scene with a high artistic quality; sadly this one is the case. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, some camera angles can give the impression of disproportion because the postures of the different dancing styles are complicated, but it must be taken into account that they are positions with a high degree of realism. The color palette is very vivid and uses a high contrast of colors where you can see the beauty of the couples, and this marks the details and character traits of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the sound, it's awesome. The series uses a vibrant score. In addition, it is listened to in a very soft way and keeps the rhythm and the action going. This helps the movement of the scenes especially the dances. The OPs and EDs are excellent and enjoyable. In my personal opinion, OP1 and ED2 are the best.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9\\n\\n\r\nI can not complain about this show; it is very entertaining. The narration is very fluid with an acceptable rhythm, creating the perfect environment for any spectator. The characters are complex and stand out. However, for some anime fans, it is possible that this type of genre is not pleasant or will complain by the lame use of the CGI,  but it is not a reason to overlook this fantastic adaptation. I'll be waiting for a continuation of the manga, and I hope that in the next few years the animation of Ballroom and Youkoso will continue.",

            "content": "Competition is a beautiful thing. It makes us strive to accomplish, to win, and hope that we can simply be good at something in our lives. When it comes to expressing talent, we try to be the show-off and express it like a form of art. For a guy named Tatara Fujita, he just wants to prove to the world that he can be good at something. That is, one day\u2026he discovers the world of ballroom dancing.\r\nWatching Ballroom e Youkoso (Welcome to the Ballroom) feels like taking a journey down memory lane. I\u2019m talking about the type of memory lane where you were once akid and wanted to prove everyone you had talent in something. Academics, sports, art, acting, singing. Just anything in general that make your friend go \u201cwow, I didn\u2019t know you could do that!\u201d As such, this anime is one that I found remarkably realistic and relatable. The first few episodes doesn\u2019t take long to establish the principle cast along with its intention.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be honest here. Tatara is a character that won\u2019t be very easy to accept for most people at first glance. He has a meek personality and seems to overestimate himself on certain circumstances. This is shown in the beginning when Tatara expresses to professional dancer Sengoku that he wants to be a pro rather than just to dance. His initial attitude makes him look like a fool as dancing isn\u2019t just something that can perfected like a click of a switch. My impression of Tatara made me realize that while he sets high expectations for himself, he does have potential but needs the right people and time to unlock it. Luckily, Tatara gets the opportunity at the Ogawara Dance Studio where other talented dancers gather to perfect their work. From the studio, Tatara also meets the very talented and beautiful Shizuku. She becomes a source of inspiration for Tatara as he strives to improve and become a pro. Throughout this show, Tatara embraces the art of ballroom dancing and becomes very determined to prove himself. From an amateur to an inspiring ballroom dancer, his character can really grow to people as we see his progress.\\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling builds on many fronts although most of it still follows Tatara and his journey. He deals with personal issues, social problems, and also establishes rivalries with certain characters he meets. At the same time, an important part of this show involve him building important relationships with others. Two particular characters stands out the most: Mako Akagi and Chinatsu Hiyama. As dancing partners, Tatara\u2019s relationship with both of these girls vary in attitude. Mako and Tatara has a friendly relationship that is based on trust, respect, and strong spirit. On the other hand, Tatara and Chinatsu\u2019s relationship is more borderline towards competitiveness. Not to mention, Chinatsu already has a dancing background and doesn\u2019t tolerate a weak partner. Throughout the anime, we see how Chinatsu begins to accept him more with their growing trust. In respect, Tatara also develops as a person as he crafts his own dancing style so that it\u2019s not just his partner carrying their dances. Whether he realizes it or not, Tatara even has influence on others. This includes making Mako realize how skilled she really is, restoring Chinatsu\u2019s love for dancing, and even influencing Shizuku to improve herself to be better. In retrospect, this anime steps over the line to make Tatara a more likeable character as time goes on.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t really say all the main cast gets decent screen time and development. While Shizuku is Tatara\u2019s initial inspiration, she doesn\u2019t get much highlight later on in this show. Don\u2019t expect this anime to focus much on Tatara\u2019s love life either. While it\u2019s obvious that Tatara crushes over Shizuku from the beginning, the show makes it clear that she prefers dancing rather than finding a boyfriend. This also applies to Tatara\u2019s other dancing partners so if romance is something on your mind, then look elsewhere. Also, be aware that this anime focuses a lot on dancing. By a lot, I mean a LOT with all types of dances, music, and style. If you\u2019re not a fan of dancing, it may take some time to enjoy this show. Ballroom dancing is portrayed as a fierce competition on the dance floor with some episodes dedicating their entire time to it. Luckily, this anime is quite a faithful adaptation for what it had to work with. With only some minor differences, it\u2019s an anime that really made me glad it got adapted. However, there are times that I wish the anime picked up the pace with its extensive background storytelling, especially in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Production I.G., this was really the number one choice. They are known for making other anime that involve competition come to life. (ex. Haikyu, All Out!, Kuroko no Basket) For this particular anime, they leave a memorable impression with the art style and character designs. The biggest selling point is the smooth camera angles and timings. When the competition gets fierce, it really draws out the talents of the dancers with their body movements. Each movement is precisely timed to show their potential with colorful aesthetics. It further amplifies them through clever facial expressions. The dancing outfits in this anime are also memorable for their coloring and hair style, in particular for the female characters. It\u2019s not to be interpreted as fan service but rather a work of art. On the other hand, there are some body parts in this anime that can be distracting. The one most worth mentioning is the overly extensive necks that can make viewers point fingers at.\\n\\n\r\nAt the core of its technical feature is the music. It\u2019s what makes the ballroom dancing come to life along with its vivid choreography. The anime mixes in a variety that includes jazz, latin, classic, and among others. Director Yoshimi Itazu really made an impression through his work by allowing the music to do the storytelling on many occasions. Without words, many of the dancing segments feels like a dream and as if time itself stopped to showcase the characters\u2019 talents. The music supplements that with its directing. Voice character mannerism is also well performed with characters like Chinatsu, Hyoudou, and the Akagi siblings. Both the OP and ED theme songs are also worth listening to for their rhythm.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show with a fierce competitive energy, this one might seem to be intimidating to watch at first. However, it\u2019s a show that I can recommend to anyone even if its selling points doesn\u2019t hit all the marks. From its character cast to storytelling, Ballroom e Youkoso is a well-adapted manga that focuses on what it intended to without betraying expectations. Sure, some characters are not as well focused compared to the others. There are also times when you wish the story can just move its pace faster. However, it\u2019s still a show that gives competition a powerful meaning.\\n",

            "content": "Have I properly read the manga for Welcome to the Ballroom? No, but I have seen it; I\u2019ve seen more than enough to know that the original creator put a ton of work and passion into his manga. While you could make the same argument for the anime, you can\u2019t argue about the anime\u2019s budget. Yup, that\u2019s right ladies and gentlemen. Production I.G. themselves finally made what I think we can all agree to be a BAD ADAPTATION.  \r\nThis anime has the sleek character designs of Haikuu!, the art style of Haikyuu!, the score of Haikuu!, but not the animation. What made sports showslike Haikuu! and all others like it so good was that the animation team behind it really brought their respective sport to life. As much as I hated Kuroko no Basket, I\u2019m still able to acknowledge how the over-the-top animation really made the characters abilities and overall athletic prowess pop. As a shut-in otaku myself, I\u2019ve never liked sports nor the jocks who played them, but the detailed animation of Haikyuu! really got me to notice how taxing the sport was on their bodies. You could tell by their shoulders and knees how exhausted they were getting, and not long after I came to see the care put into the animation, I gained genuine respect for the teams who really worked hard for victory. Ballroom has none of that. Most of the dance sequences are still images, and the background dancers are always ugly CG. The motivation of the MC, Tatara, was that he was a nobody, and seeing professional dancers do their thing made him realize just how much he wanted to be \u201cseen\u201d himself. That\u2019s a good motivation and all, but when we, the audience, see all this shitty animation and out-of-place CG all we can really think is, \u201cYou were inspired by THAT?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s sad too because when you watch either OP as well as a quick (nine second) scene in episodes 11 and 24 you can really see what could have been. It\u2019s a shame Production I.G. didn\u2019t have the budget to make this show at it\u2019s full potential. \\n\\n\r\nOther than the constant stain of the lack of a budget, the show is actually really good. The characters are likable and hatable when they need to be, and the story progresses at a, sometimes slow, but overall reasonable pace. This pacing really allows you to notice the changes in the characters\u2019 respective dancing styles and moral outlook on the sport. Their relationships are charming and you can see where everyone\u2019s coming from in any decision making process. Some flashback-backstory in the latter half of the show is a little forced, but that doesn\u2019t mean the actual content of said flashbacks were bad at all. The voice actors and actresses are definitely not getting paid enough; some of these characters, especially the cute girls, had me down for their characters on their voices alone. That on top of the already competent script was great to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I\u2019d like to address that good old Production I.G. Magic that Haikyuu! and it\u2019s contemporaries had: \\n\r\nIt\u2019s there, but the animation is still a real hindrance. There\u2019s scenes throughout the show that really make you get along with the emotions and the themes the show is presenting, and you almost feel inspired. Again, I imagine the source material was really something special. It\u2019s a shame the anime wasn\u2019t able to give it justice. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I\u2019d say give it a watch, but don\u2019t hesitate to drop it. I don\u2019t really believe in the \u201cthree episode rule\u201d because while some shows put everything they have to offer in episode one, others sometimes don\u2019t reveal all their cards until the double digits. For Ballroom, I\u2019d say that if you don\u2019t like it by episode six, don\u2019t worry about it.",

            "content": "Anime  Has often surprised me with the fact that how unpredictable it can really get. We often think to ourselves, that having watched so many shows, nothing can really surprise us anymore, But yet again, we are proved wrong with every new season. Take Fune wo amu for example, I never thought i  will watch an anime about dictionaries, And yet I found myself loving it more and more. And now we have Ballroom, An anime which explores the world of ballroom dancing, A sport which is perhaps is one of the most peculiar one out there , and perhaps  the mostelegant one too, And surprisingly makes it more interesting than you might really expect it to be.\\n\\n\r\nSports anime have existed pretty much since the beginning of  the medium itself. From football to basketball, and even Shogi, We have seen almost all kind of games, And its not wrong to say that these anime, rather than the game, are now all about building the hype and adrenaline rush within the viewer, and keep them captivated.  Welcome to ballroom explores the world of ballroom dancing, which as a sport is not really that well known to many, But Rather than just being all about the game itself, Ballroom is somehow able to bring out the true beauty of Dancing, Not as a sport, But more as a form of art. It also gives the competitive vibe of the game as we would expect from any other sport anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow,When it comes to the story, Sports anime are not really known for their story lines. Of course we have seen sport  anime, with some pretty amazing storylines, But as mentioned before, Many of them are really all about sports, Which is not really a bad thing. Ballroom also offers little in this department, What we see is the generic run off the mill plot line that we we have really seen a hell lot of a times before. But, what really differentiates a good sport anime from other genre of anime, is that how it overcomes the lack of a proper story line , by offering the viewer something  more than that, That is , The real excitement of the game itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime can be simply broken down into two parts here, The first one is more focused towards Tatara, The MC, as a a learner, who is slowly trying to grasp the concept of dancing . He is just a newbie who is learning , and is not someone you will refer to as a good dancer. The second half on the other hand is about how overcomes his weaknesses and learns more about himself . How he also tries to prove himself as a worthy dancer and  built his identity in this world of dancing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, universally are known as the most important part of any anime , However, In such anime, their role is of much more importance than others. Ballroom shows The  conflicts, self doubt,excitement, and of course, the anxiety, that the Characters hide behind their smiling faces on the stage.\\n\\n\r\n The main character Tatara, has been struggling to find his purpose in life, more than anyone, he wants to prove his talents to the world, but is confused about how to do so, And he finds His own way in this world of Dance. He still  is new to the world of dancing, and really has no special talent for doing it either. But he still works hard to become the very best and most of all, he is portrayed  a strong willed and determined person and  not as a wimp. However, It doesn't hide the fact that he is really just a generic character that we might have seen before . However, as mentioned before, it is the second half from where things change. Introduction of Chinatsu is The most important part of the second half, As she is not just the new partner of Tatara, But a person who completely changes him and also the world around him. She is much like a tomboy, who uses harsh words , but cares about Tatara more Than anyone else. She is an experienced dancer herself, But her inability to become a partner makes her really no different from Tatara, With is inexperience in leading. And This mismatched combo is perhaps The best part of the entire show itself\\n\\n\r\nNow, talking about characters, we should also see that the other characters are not overshadowed in any way, In fact they actually shine out the most in the first half of the show, quite literally. Both the girls, Mako and shizuka, have played important roles in the development of Tatara as dancer. They have both played as his partners and have been major part of the story. Sengoku san served as his mentor and have taught him everything he knows. These other characters do have played major roles, but just in support of Tatara, That is for the most part, and we do not really get to see a lot about them, But as said there presence is not overshadowed. In fact, one of my most favorite parts of the show was the Mako Tatara solo, in which Mako was the main presence and she quite literally shone beautifully  like a flower.\\n\\n\r\nLike other Sports anime, Ballroom also brings along with it , some in depth trivia and facts about the sport. It just shows us how watching people dance and actually being on the stage is completely different experiences.  .It also goes a bit deeper by showing us the psychological  battles that these people go through while on the stage, The anime shows how much does an actual person goes through when on a stage, The split second decisions and of course To maintain  The focus on the partner. But more than that, It shows the true happiness These people feel while on the stage. Honestly, The show does and excellent job of portraying all these complex feelings of these people, without being too forceful with it. \\n\\n\r\nNow when we talk about dance, music is something which naturally comes to our minds along with it, So as one would think in such anime music of course would play in important role. Now Both the Op are very good in my opinion, They tend to be fast paced and built the excitement within the viewer. The music played within the scenes, That is during the dance routines, is somewhat overshadowed, Now the anime is focused on dance, but music is as important, The anime uses different styles of music and effects for different  dance routines, however the music sometimes, just tends to get a bit overshadowed, which is not really good. Both the ED are also pretty fine, Tho second one is my favorite. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, I guess, is just pretty average. The anime uses a bright color palette , Which fits quite well with the series, But there is really nothing special heer, That is , until the things get on the stage. The beautiful animations during the dance literally make the characters and music , come to life. The smooth movement, the Beautiful special effects just makes things even more beautiful. The character design is also pretty fine, but thins get real when they are on stage, The facial expressions they make are more than enough to convey their satisfaction and happiness. Overall, The art section is really well done .\\n\\n\r\nNow dance is something which we would expect to see in a sports anime, But don't let that fact deceive you, Because this show is nothing less than any other sport show out there. Its fast paced, beautifully animated and gets you excited and makes you wish for even more.   It is something  everyone should experience once. It shows something like dance, which we might not really think of often, in a way we would  never expect. It does have its flaws, however, in total, Its an enjoyable  ride, that everyone should try.",

            "content": "Now that, is seriously an unexpected but a very pleasant surprise. Damn, that is something really lighting up! Dancing TV shows have really been a trend lately, but what I\u2019ve just witnessed is something much more impressive. The anime is 100% about ballroom dancing exclusively.\r\nThis is the very first anime series dedicated to professional ballroom dancing, if I\u2019m correct, hell, that\u2019s the first anime dedicated to dancing at all! There\u2019s been lots of shows about all other kinds of sports like basketball, football, baseball, tennis, volleyball, swimming,\u2026 and tooons of others, and finally, FINALLY, we\u2019ve got to ballroom dancing, which can\u2019t make me anything buthappy. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, being a ballroom dancer myself for 15 years, I\u2019m SUPER DUPPER OVERMYHEAD EXCITED seeing my favorite sport at last getting an anime adaptation, and though it\u2019s only\u2019ve been a couple episodes, but trust the expert, judging from what I saw \u2013 this is gonna be EPIC.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is more than simple. A total newbie is been dragged into the world of dancing by some stranger who happens to be an expert and will teach our hero and bla-bla-bla\u2026 Now agree, that is mostly common plot thing to almost every sports anime, not to mention that our main character is making a tremendous progress since the very beginning of his trainings\u2026 aaand that\u2019s all because he\u2019s been charmed by a beautiful classmate girl who also happens to be into dancing (actually he was just stalking after her and that\u2019s how it all happened, but that\u2019s not a thing). The thing is that the creators have really made a COLOSSAL work by showing every single move of the dancers that we see, such detailed, every singe line and angle of their body as they stand prepared to waltz, every dynamic motion as they dance cha-cha, and every emotion on their faces \u2013 from serious and confident tango to romantic and sensual rumba.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, all I can tell about an art style is \u201cFANTASTIC\u201d. Though I\u2019m not a fan of frequent usage of 3D in anime (more a fan of an old animating style), this one does deserve to be noticed and praised for its aliveness, vividness and multicolourness.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime will amaze you with musical compositions \u2013 rhythmic and inflammatory \u2013 they will make you dance even sitting on a chair. From opening to ending \u2013 this is a trip to a wonderland that will drag you into an unrestrained yet splendid whirlpool of dance sports and you WILL beg for MORE. Not to mention flawlessly looking girls who will make your heart beat speed up twenty times faster;)\\n\\n\r\nThe show is expected to be on the level of \u201cYour Lie in April\u201d that startled us with great characters, its own unique drawing style and a feeling of full immersion in deep waters of music; this is what you SHOULD look forward to from \u201cWelcome to the Ballroom\u201d series,\u2026 but about dancing.\\n",

            "content": "Ballroom e Youkoso\u2019s hype sank faster than 2-ton anchor. And it\u2019s easy to see why. The show is plagued by lackluster animation and unlikeable characters. \r\nBallroom\u2019s biggest disappointment is the extreme lack of any actual dancing (or ballroom-styled music). Shows can survive dull characters and repetitive melodrama if they deliver something else worth sticking around for, but Ballroom failed on its biggest promise - to see some dancing. \r\nInstead of dancing, we get drawn stills and repetitive commentary from the audience about how great someone is or how much they improved or the differences between one dancing style and another, but never see any ofit. And any dancing we do see looks more like chickens flapping around than anything graceful. \\n\\n\r\nThe lack of any actual dancing also removes a good deal of tension from the show, a staple of sports anime. Instead of seeing action, we hear commentary on the action, breaking any chance of creating tension whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nBad animation isn\u2019t the only reason behind the show\u2019s lack of tension. While we\u2019re watching our dancing stills and hearing people talk about them, we have very little clue about the sport itself. The points system, what judges are looking for, and any rules are only touched upon. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are as disappointing as the animation. When Tatara\u2019s not complaining, he acts a sponge that exists to soak up other characters\u2019 drama. In the first half of the season, he\u2019s at least a boring-but-nice guy, but in the second cour, he spends most of this time failing to take action and complaining a lot. \\n\\n\r\nOddly, Tatara is also the local psychologist - I guess. Not only is it weird that these characters (specifically, Shizuku and Mako) start blabbing their issues to someone they barely know, but they never actually talk to the person they\u2019re having an issue with. The drama between these two girls and their dancing partners magically disappear without direct confrontation, which is not only confusing, but also misses on potential drama and character growth. \\n\\n\r\nThe trend continues in the second half. Akira and Chinatsu get two episodes dedicated to their past history - but hardly interact with each other in the present. Instead, we get a clunky two-episode flashback from Akira\u2019s point of view and jump back into the present without furthering Chinatsu\u2019s and Akira\u2019s relationship in any way whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nChinatsu is flat-out mean at times, and Tatara is flat-out pathetic. Their nonsense gets old after the first 10 episodes of the same thing over and over. On top of that, our supposed antagonist-rivals, Kugimiya and Akira, were made so sympathetic, that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever wanted the leads to lose so badly before. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d say the odd, creepy fanservice moments earlier on where we\u2019re supposed to be entertained by a highschool girl getting peeped on and embarrassed by an older man is unnecessary. But this anime never had much going for it. \\n\\n\r\nBallroom had so much promise. An anime about a visual sport? I was hoping for Yuri on Ice 2.0. By the end, I was hoping for anything remotely interesting to happen - including seeing a full dancing routine (crazy, right?). Instead, Ballroom provides little dancing, little tension, and lots of repetition and unlikeable characters.\\n",

            "content": "I couldn't wait to start watching Ballroom e Youkoso, but it really missed the mark. While it has a lot of problem, I'll focus on two big ones: failure as a sports anime and a boring lead. \r\nI love sports anime. The drama. The tears. The tension. I love Ping Pong the Animation, Haikyuu!!, and the Yuri on ICE!!!. But Ballroom fails at a fundamental level when it comes to being a \"sports anime\". \r\nFirst, almost none of dancing is actually animated, which is pretty surprising considering Production I.G. also brought us Haikyuu!!. Sure it's difficult to animate characters in motion, but YOI dedicated alot of screen-time to skating routines (maybe even too much). When I started a ballroom dancing anime, I expected more than a few seconds of footwork every episode. Instead I got a bunch of stills with long-necked characters bearing frankly creepy smiles and long-winded narrations about why a character is dancing well or not. Later we also see weird metaphors that meant the anime lowered its budget or author went on a existential bender. Some of these ended up looking so silly that I laughed so hard I cried. \\n\\n\r\nWithout clearly defined rules (like get the ball over the net) and with no visuals to help you out, the audience must rely wholly on narration to build tension, and it's pretty boring. There wasn't a single moment where I was holding my breath, waiting to see if our character would win. Even Kuroko No Basket (which I wasn't a huge fan of) built a lot of tension in games, as all sports anime should. The lack of rules and dancing animation sucked away the tension. Therefore Ballroom, as a sports anime, fails. \\n\\n\r\nBut wait! Some sport anime, like Ballroom, are character focused, so the tension comes from the characters, right? Sure. I love Ping Pong The Animation. During the show's final match you don't even care who wins because the tension is invested in character's growth. Yuri on ICE!!! and Free! are also character-focused sport anime, but both build more tension than Ballroom.\\n\\n\r\nWhy?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are more developed and more interesting than Ballroom's cast. Fujita Tatara is about as interesting as a piece of wet toast. He whines about not being a good enough dancer for 24 episodes (basically the typical shounen plea of \"I need to get stronger). Tatara is on trend with \"nicer shounen leads\", but he falls flat when compared to, say, Hinata from Haikyuu!! or Midoriya from Boku no Hero Academia. It would've been less irritating if he another conflict he could've overcome.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the side characters have potential, they get stuck talking to Tatara, which makes for lack lust conversations. Instead of seeing two characters with tension or conflict duke it out, both characters talk to Tatara about their problems, which results in disappointing resolutions to character conflicts. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of all of this, there are some unnecessary fan service scenes and narrative issues that make this anime subpar. It can't hurt to watch if you like sports anime, but you're not missing anything special if you don't. Despite front-loading the first episodes with fan service, the first dvd didn't sell well, which doesn't surprise me.\\n\\n\r\nThe last episodes made it terribly difficult to root for what I liked to call the \"limp noodle and wild mare pairing\" over the other pairings, who all proved more interesting and complex.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was so cheesy and predictable it could've made a Disney character puke. But with little to no dancing animation, it was hard to judge the caliber of the dancers. This just proves the anime, at a fundamental level, failed. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like dull leads, predictable plots, a cluster of shounen tropes, and long-winded dialogues about how good/bad someone is dancing, go for it. Otherwise, you aren't missing anything.",

            "content": "Coming from Production IG who's track record we are all aware of, Ballroom e Youkoso is certainly a star in this packed summer 2017 season. \r\nThis run of sport and athletic anime being produced is really a joy for me to see. The diversity and vast approach all of them are taking and the care they are putting into portraying these different sports, it's something wonderful to see. Ballroom e Youkoso is a part of this wondrous run. \r\nAs far as the story goes, I am a little disappointed with regards to the setup. Fujita being a complete novice but yet holding some miraculous abilitythat goes beyond reason, Hyodou being an absolute beast on the floor. This is something we have seen time and again, but the show is charming enough to compensate for this well trodden road. The addition of Hanaoka, who is talented in her own right, as Hyodou's partner and the focus of Fujita's fancies, and then Sengoku, former superstar who is now a teacher, it feels a bit like a mashup in ideas between Haikyuu and Yuri on Ice. They all work well together, especially considering the fact that the anime is about dance. \\n\\n\r\nFujita's arc so far has been enjoyable, watching him and his growing desire to compete is quite admirable. His growth as a dancer is almost laughable but then there are moments where his internal brilliance shines through and you get caught off guard, just like the characters in the show. \\n\r\nI also appreciate that even though Fujita is the MC, the other pairs and members of the dance studio play such an integral part in his development. They aren't exactly a team but function as some sort of strange family with rivalries and desires to get better. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the show really sends it to the top in my honest opinion. The art exaggerates the postures and figures of everyone in the show, which makes the dancing feel that much more real. In real life, dancers are meant to be larger than life and this show captures that well. Everyone appears long, everything flows, it's all extremely dynamic, the steps are crisp and precise, the emotion shines through each movement. It really is a great example of how to animate an activity with such a range in movements, from little swings of the hip and sliding of the feet to leaps and quick steps in succession. \\n\\n\r\nAs the season progresses, I am eager to see more of the dancing, how it evolves and how all the students can overcome their own personal dilemmas through their dance of choice.",

            "content": "Ballroom e Youkoso (Welcome to the Ballroom) is an open love letter to those struggling with ambition, goals and dreams. While primarily an anime about the sport of competitive Ballroom dancing and everything that comes with it, the point of this series is that it\u2019s never too late to do what you\u2019re passionate about and that you should never let anything\u2014whether it be age or other people\u2019s opinions, stop you. You learn this message through the characters journey and a rhetorical question that is brought to focus, many times along the way, \u201cWhy do you dance?\u201d.\r\nBased on Tomo Takeuchi\u2019s manga, Welcome to the Ballroom revolvesaround a young boy who has no passions and no idea what he wants to pursue in life in Tatara Fujita\u2014while that may sound corny to some, it is a very real-world problem that most of us have gone through. Life hasn\u2019t been kind to our protagonist, he was a victim of bullying in middle school, his parents are divorced, his teacher had little hopes for him and that he didn\u2019t have any prospects for high school. One day, on a whim, he followed his beautiful classmate Shizuku Hanaoka home, which brought him to the Ogasawara Dance Studio, headed by none other than the champion ballroom dancer Kaname Sengoku. After becoming captivated by watching Shizuku and Sengoku\u2019s performances, an ember of flames emits within Tatara, he has discovered something that not only he has the natural talent for but also a new found love in dancing, something he learns and pickups quickly and becoming more passionate about it. This sets the stage for a \u201cCinderella\u201d type of story, not only in his new-found passion and aiming for the pros but also as a person with many flaws\u2014the transformation he goes through is nothing short of inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nBallroom puts the focus exclusively on a few select characters, rather than a whole cast of characters, and I think this allows each character to have their fair share of the spotlight, it actually treats its characters like people with fleshed out personalities. Rivals and new characters were introduced gradually into the series with each arc, giving us time to get to know each character and get comfortable with them before new characters are presented. Indeed, the story is centred around Tatara\u2019s perspective and his growth, but ample time is given for the other characters to shine as well. The diverse mix of personalities in the series keeps it interesting\u2014the powerful and charismatic Sengoku, the dark and mysterious Masami Kugimiya, the talented and hardworking Kiyoharu Hyoudou, the determined and elegant Shizuku, the cute and humble Mako Akagi, and the bossy but skilled Chinatsu Hiyama. Chinatsu becomes one of the most intriguing characters in the series. It\u2019s always nice to see strong female personalities in anime, and Chinatsu\u2019s fiery disposition truly depicts that. The clashing dynamics between Tatara and Chinatsu, whose personalities are the complete opposite of the other is very interesting, there is a special chemistry between the two where despite the clashing and conflicts, they complete each other.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Tatara and Chinatsu are on the floor, they aren\u2019t always in sync, but they are always moving. One pushes, another yield's. Then the roles are reversed. Back and forth, back and forth. They\u2019re not fighting. Their energies are harmonized\u2014towards the mutual goal of a seamless performance, eventually, they're perfectly balanced against one another. Even in instances where the pair is fighting\u2014whether it be subtextual, verbally, or physically, the balance remains. They are evenly matched. Each gives as good as he or she gets\u2014and there is inevitably a certain measure of respect, one for the other\u2019s skill. They spar almost from the moment they meet. Their arguments are earnest, but their energy is always aligned, the chemistry between them is the best thing this series has going for it. This is the result of putting two lively characters together where they create a dance of opposition and harmony, having a focus on dynamic character archetype, enacting change and finally creating coherent conflict. Unfortunately, the execution isn\u2019t always on point for some parts, this can be very frustrating but it gets it right towards the end. Tatara\u2019s circumstances are also something viewers might be able to relate to, as a newbie, Tatara gets the feeling that he\u2019s \u201carrived late\u201d and that he\u2019s in a hurry to catch up with the others. At some point, we have all found a new passion or hobby that we wished we had started before, hence fearing that we\u2019re not as good as we could have been, or that we might have missed out on many things. The message here as mentioned earlier is that it\u2019s never too late.\\n\\n\r\nIt is clear to see which studio was in charge of adapting Ballroom as you can see similarities visually to Haikyuu!! and Production I.G\u2019s work here is like a mixed bag of candies\u2014you get the bad with the good. The character designs, colour palette and background look very gorgeous in Production I.G signature fashion. But there are certain things like the exaggerated movements and facial expressions that can be off-putting at times, even entering \u2018memes\u2019 territory like the long necks and creepy faces. While it doesn\u2019t quite excel in the quantity of animating full-dancing sequences, but it does deliver in moments of pure beauty, like Mako\u2019s \u201cblooming\u201d performance. For the most part, its portrayal of the grace of a dancer\u2019s body well is something to appreciate, I particular like the detailing in the perspiration of the dancers, it\u2019s telling in how much effort and energy is put into a performance of Ballroom dancing and indicates to the audience, the physical and emotional strains competitors have during competitions.\\n\\n\r\nBoth OP\u2019s by Unison Square Garden was very upbeat and did a superb job hyping up the atmosphere for the main course. The ED\u2019s by Mikako Komatsu was really sweet and very fitting to end each episode on. The first ending in particular, \u201cMaybe The Next Waltz\u201d left a deep impression on me when I first heard it. Incorporating instruments like the violin and the bass and paired with just the right art scenes, it gave a sort of classical and sincere vibe that is rarely heard in today\u2019s music. The voice acting is one of Ballroom\u2019s strengths, the voices complemented the characters\u2019 personalities well, and that goes for the entire main cast and supporting roles. I especially liked Sengoku and Chinatsu\u2019s voice actors in, Toshiyuki Morikawa and Chinatsu Akasaki. The actual soundtrack isn\u2019t particularly memorable in my opinion, but they match the scenes well and does their job, especially when it comes to the dancing segments.\\n\\n\r\nBallroom is certainly not a perfect show, it has some issues that need to be brought to light\u2014the pacing, the duration on certain conflicts, visuals and animation in dancing segments, and the tone, but they weren\u2019t consistent issues to the point of being unbearable. And this is what stops the series from being one of the greats of recent memory. This was something the final episode did brilliantly, it shows us why Tatara dances. I believe, on some level, everyone wants, and deserves to be able to shout \u201cLook at me!\u201d to the world. Even shy people yearn to be the centre of attention sometimes, especially for something they\u2019re successful at. Personally, this is the visceral draw of competitive dance\u2014it\u2019s a sport, performance art and an explosion of personal expression all rolled into one. Remember, it never too late to do what you want in life. Discovering passions late shouldn\u2019t discourage you from not fully committing yourself and reaching newly found goals. You can shape your life the way you want it.\\n",

            "content": "Sports shows sometimes are very hard to handle especially on the art and animation category. Some studio really pushed their limits just to achieve and match the sports for the sake of the overall production of the series. But don't you worry, Production I.G is back to save the day! before I conclude my review, let me discuss the show's fine points and noticeable flaws \r\nThis really bothers me when I watched the very first episode. The similarities  between this show and Hajime no Ippo's pilot episode is insane. This is definitely interesting or rather annoying for other people but for me atleast, Istill quite enjoy the 1st episode even though the execution isn't original. The overall plot is quite decent, I think the show doesn't really bother saving all of its full potential rather than making a risk and just blows everything up just to impress us the audience very early in the series. The show really excels on the general build up, giving us major informations that helps us to enjoy and understand the series. Though not all of them are given, there are times that you can't understand some of its given basic rules or even major guidelines for the competitions. Also I find the characters quite appealing, tho they're still not that very well fleshed out. But overall the show still really is trying hard to give us knowledge to understand the show fully. Btw, you know that one series that blew all of its animation budget for episode 1? and then as the show goes on, the quality melted? Ballroom e Youkoso wants to avoid that. ( \"Yes we were born to make history!\"~ ) \\n\\n\r\nI won't say much on the art because that's Production I.G for you. Stellar visuals, very detailed character designs, clean frames and great cinematography. I love the style and the details for the series but there is that one major problem that the series really can't avoid even for bigger studios like Production I.G, the lack of time for animating complicated performances. That's ballroom for you, very good to look at when it's animated perfectly but very hard to animate and it takes so much time. For now, I've seen some dancing scenes that felt too short, for the most part it's just editing and a detailed keyframe. I'll definitely accept Production I.G rotoscoping real ballroom sequences rather than having them waste time on animating these from scratch. ( Tho, it is confirmed that I.G really don't rotoscope real movements, they're more likely to use them as reference.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ballroom e Youkoso is a good show, having such fascinating visuals and with an interesting premise really deserves to be one of the highlights of this season. But let's still wait and see if this show really deserves the praise. Do I recommend you to watch it? Definitely! Is it for everyone, probably. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Sengoku saves the show for me , and that ball grabbing guy. My favorite scene in whole anime till now. Makes me remember about Gintama.\r\nOk lets go. MC is a crybaby, no special born-gifted talent, no hardworking, screws up most of the time and is hard to understand. But other characters are logical reasonable and filled with awesomeness. Like Sengoku, like Kurusomething, like Sengoku partner, like Mako, like Gaju. But others i dont know they dont fit to those characters and art and music. \u0130ts like they are gathered from other shows. This is actually why i dont like this show that much. \u0130 watchedit to see if anything catches me but i will leave it at 16th episode and if i see a score jump after this show is finished then i will start from where i leff.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Art is little brother of Haikyu, and story is not everywhere Haikyu. \u0130ts not about dance, i think its about when you present dancing with this art,music and great characters it makes dance look like an lady in his 50s tring to race with Usain Bolt or tring to block DeAndre Jordan.\\n\\n\r\n\u0130 think thats all what i think about this show but hey i think its bad, its not horrible, if possible id like to give it 5,75 points. Oh well i didnt have that option. But i can say this is show is not best of summer 2017, anime doesnt have endless potential like a living human being can have and this anime is at least something you can spend your time if you are free. Lastly as a old sportsman i will leave this here, Sports are not good looking aesthetic part of art. From what i got while watching this anime is Dancing in general is best when it does look good not when you run like you are escaping from Godzilla or its not like you are shooting a beam to enemy tower. \u0130ts like \" Yeeey we look so nice and artistic.\" No. Sorry to all dancers but im not gonna accept dancing as a sports even if its in Olympics or whatever. This is why i didnt like story at all, it is presented wrong in my opinion, even on worldwide where all people accepts it. Would be better if this was just a Netorare hentai or a Romantic Drama like Scum's Wish which is the show i hate most.",

            "content": "Beautiful , Emotional ,Enjoyable and Brilliant ! From an anime that focuses on dancing i got more than i was expecting! A masterpiece!\r\nWelcome to the Ballroom is one of the candidates for anime of the year. At first i was wondering what an anime about social dancing could offer to me as a viewer who has no particular interest in these stuff. I got myself into a fantastic show who knows how to built up the tension in each episode and release it on the dance floor, in a beautiful display of the characters thoughts and feelings during their dance and finally i got someknowledge  about the dancing world. Let's not forget the enjoyment after finishing each episode that leaft a great taste in my mouth. If you are hesistant to watch it because of that trust me it's worth your time and it will exceed your expectations. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is layered in two acts and follows the development of our main character Tatara as he venture into the world of dancing.  He discovers and experience new stuff and emotions that break his ordinary world and make him step up his game. The focus is not only on Tatara, the story has more  to offer  such as competitions, rivals, different styles and genres of dancing(quickstep, waltz ) ,the effort and time spend on mastering your own style as a dancer, what it needs for a dancing pair/couple to work as one, leader/follower in a pair  and finally how all these things influence the lives of the characters as dancers. Amazing!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great and the funny interactions between them manages to make them easier to be understood by the viewers. They develop and shine on the dance floor were each dance gives you a bump of adrenaline. What it's impressive in this anime is how they manage to connect its audience to the mindset, emotions and tensed atmosphere that our characters feel on the dance floor. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals and great music play an important role throughout this series and manage to make an ordinary dance from boring to brilliant  and make the dancers bloom like a beautiful flower on the dance floor.\\n\r\nIf i may complain of something about this show that would be the first episodes who are kinda slow but even this can't ruin my overall enjoyment and impression. Just watch it is damn awesome!",

The animation is great and seeing all the work that was put into this anime is amazing. I appreciate the crews hard work and the creator for making this. The characters are unique and sometimes you can get lost with what their goals are but that could just be lost in whether or not you're paying attention to the subtitles and show or just watching the images itself. The maincharacter is relatable and offers so much potential to this anime. I am up to date with the manga and since this anime's release I have been excited to see it all animated and where it leads next. The music is nice and fits very well! I enjoy this anime because it keeps my attention and I can relate to it because who hasn't been like the main character at some point in their lives when they try something new and want to get better?",

It turns out our guy is a wimpy useless liberal left feminist douche! And the new girl is more manly with good bully future.

            "content": "May contain slight spoilers...\r\nFor an anime that\u2019s entire focus is dancing, I\u2019m a little disappointed in some of the dance scenes I found in Welcome to the Ballroom. Why, you may ask? Well, if I had to sum up my issues with the show, I\u2019d probably blame them on the show\u2019s budget. Of course, it wasn\u2019t all bad as I thoroughly enjoyed the characters that I met in this 2 cour anime, and the drama and comedy kept me watching for more, but I just couldn\u2019t shake the problems I kept picking up on.\r\nFirst of all, let\u2019s start with the good points. The characters areall lovely and most of them get their own special moment in the spotlight. We either watch them dance their hearts out or peer into their backstories that are filled with all the hardships that they endured to become the athletes they are today. Their interactions with each other are also hilarious, as dancers competing in their pairs are forced to try and somewhat get along, allowing some funny or gripping moments between the cast.\\n\\n\r\nEach of their differing personalities clashes with each other, from an enthusiastic newbie that learns differently from others, the professionals that practice endlessly to maintain their status and a female dancer that would rather act as the male lead role in the couple. The more you progress into the show, the more you learn about a certain someone as they continue to grow in experience and skill. Add in rivals and silly facial reactions and it becomes a joy to watch their antics as they either try to teach the new kid to dance the basics or look away when one of them is being subjected to some painful joint stretches. You can\u2019t help but have fun watching the cast training to perfect their dance routines or enjoying their lives as school students.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, these same elements are used to create drama as well, with a sibling couple separating cause they can\u2019t seem to reach their full potential together or an old-fashioned dancer trying to make a comeback after being out of the game for awhile. You can\u2019t be the best in anything if you don\u2019t overcome obstacles, and the show knows how to create situations for our characters so they can rise up to the challenge. The mix of laughter and tears accumulate into a story that just draws you into their world of professional ballroom dancing as they enter tournament after tournament to show off their style to everyone around them.\\n\\n\r\nNow the main issue I have with the show, the actual dancing. Due to it being an animated show locked under money constraints, it\u2019s forced to use way too many stills and transitions to try and make it\u2019s dancing scenes barely \u201cpassable\u201d. If may work for other anime to do something like this, but for a sport that solely relies on body movement to entertain its audience, a lot of the time there is not enough actual movement.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s even worse is all the dialogue that should just be going on in the background becomes the focus as the camera is forced from the characters dancing to someone in the audience commenting on what\u2019s happening. Instead of being an anime about dancing, it seems to turn into an anime about people talking about dancing a few too many times.\\n\\n\r\nThe music for some tournaments also needs to be improved, as there are a quite a few scenes where the songs in the first half don\u2019t exactly match the dancing. Dancing and music go hand in hand, so to mess up something as important as this, along with every other issue mentioned, it\u2019s gonna lower the enjoyment of the show quite significantly. It might be better to just read the manga where it\u2019s already still/quiet so you won't have to sit through the anime's problems or wait for a movie that has more time and cash to actually put in the effort needed to make the show look good.\\n\\n\r\nEven with the frequently lacklustre dance animation, Welcome to the Ballroom was still a joy to watch each week. The characters and story kept me from hating the show, keeping my score and view of the show decently high. Of course, there may be people that can\u2019t forgive an anime for being unable to properly portray its main focus, so some might see the manga as best option if you still wanna try the series. If I had to choose between calling this show a good or bad experience, I would have to say it was pretty good, so at least try it out for yourself. Anime or manga, whichever one you decide, just let yourself get dragged into their story.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nFor as long as I have known my older sister, she has been a dancer through and through.\r\nEverywhere has counted: at the school talent show, at her local studio, at numerous recitals, at different states. Everything has counted as well: tap, ballet, hip-hop, Latin. Across her entire leg-driven journey, she has claimed enough awards and cheers and experience to last a lifetime.\r\nBasically, she has seen and partaken in nearly all that dance has to offer. Despite her dancing expertise, though, I have yet to hear any mention of ballrooms. And after watching the entirety ofBallroom e Youkoso, I can confidently say, as someone with zero dance moves whatsoever, she is seriously missing out.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe world of competitive ballroom dancing may not exactly be on the forefront of everyone\u2019s mind. It exists within that niche corner given its lack of truly intense traits and low popularity. It tends to also be a very difficult sport to get into, demanding countless hours of repeating the same basic techniques and requiring certain physical builds to succeed. And its set of unfair stigmas potentially turn people away from the get-go before they even give it a fair chance.\\n\\n\r\nBallroom e Youkoso faces such negativity head up and foot forward without ever losing a beat.\\n\\n\r\nTrue to its premise, the anime understandably makes it a priority to explain what goes on within ballroom dancing for the uninitiated (which, again, is most likely a majority). The dances themselves \u2013 the waltz, the quickstep, the tango \u2013 are paramount, so the differences, the nuances, and the moves between them become a focal point. Tons of smaller details about the league, the scoring, the ranks, the gender ratios, and the types also pop up to further flesh out the formation of the sport and thus the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is not just content with explaining itself; Ballroom e Youkoso also demonstrates what makes ballroom dancing worthwhile to begin with. It does so with a passionate edge, a look-see into the minds of the dancers themselves. In doing so, the show grants itself a cooler, fuller picture of its scenes beyond just watching a bunch of people twirl and step about.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, ballroom dancing posits that mutual chemistry between two people causes a better understanding of one\u2019s self as adaptation and sympathy take hold. Moreover, it demonstrates a willingness and a purpose on behalf of the dancers, for they choose this sport not for direct confrontation but instead as a want and as a desire to prove their capabilities to the masses. And the sport simply brings fun and happiness as synchronized steps form rapturous emotion for the dancers, the judges, and the audience at large.\\n\\n\r\nLooking into Ballroom e Youkoso on a narrative level, it showcases a solid-enough plot as the practices, the tournaments, and the conflicts naturally arise. Furthermore, themes on self-worth and numerous engaging moments affix an appropriate amount of drama. It could be argued that the competitions tend to stretch out too long at times, but the intermittent hype of the dances and those introspective thoughts of the characters yield the right amount of variety to keep these stretches manageable.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does not earn full marks in every round, though. The occasional sexual content is not totally out of place when considering the sensuality of dancing itself and the attractive people who believe this sport to be their calling. Akira commenting on Chinatsu\u2019s extreme beauty or Chinatsu in turn teasing Akira for her extra curves do not cross over into weird territory.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the infrequent \u201cjokes\u201d related to accidents, sizes, and masculinity can cross the line, clashing too much with the seriousness of the drama and leaning too far outside of the lighthearted direction of the comedy overall.\\n\\n\r\nBesides this problem, some of the writing and the dialogue can come off as antiquated due to the terminology surrounding the male-and-female duos. But this awkwardness deals more so with the culture of the sport and treads into nitpicking territory since the ladies are themselves a powerful bunch anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the setup, the purpose, and the structure of the story allow positivity to reign supreme within this dancing spectacle.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOn the visual side, Ballroom e Youkoso continues its strong stride.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs start things off right. Nice line work and facial details in general increase the accuracy of their depictions and therefore give greater definition to their expressions. Their casual garb versus their competitive attire \u2013 especially for how much handsomer and prettier the men and women respectively jump \u2013 makes for a lovely contrast, too. Even their overly long necks (giraffes or no) contribute an elegance and a fragility which further emphasizes the impact of their dances.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the audience must suspend some disbelief that these near-pro-yet-still amateurs are at the tail-end of middle school despite looking like college kids or outright adults. Nevertheless, their slender frames once again bolster the ballroom motif, and their different builds even become a factor in the character writing itself.\\n\\n\r\nNot so right is Ballroom e Youkoso\u2019s penchant for reusing past moments or segments to a noticeable degree. Tatara\u2019s ginormous smile as he comes into frame comes to mind. While not a deal-breaker (since it is unrealistic to expect an absolute, constant upkeep of new depictions), it leaves the show for want of stronger artistic appeal.\\n\\n\r\nIt combats against this detriment with interspersed scenes filled with style and creativeness. Kiyoharu and Shizuku turn on fire at one point as their dancing heats up, and Tatara and Chinatsu break down doors together amidst their foggy consciousness. Whatever the case may be, these scenes up the intrigue and the fascination of the presentation, giving Ballroom e Youkoso another leg to stand on as its vital events commence.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime deserves some extra credit, too. Animating and articulating the complexities of dancers, both on their own and in unison, is by no means an easy feat. And, despite the troubles outlined above, the dancing depicted almost never took on any outright mistakes or notable hiccups. Rather, Ballroom e Youkoso took many a creative liberty with perspectives and proportions to up the ante.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the back bending could be slightly less obtuse, but this exaggeration furthers the finesse this sport demands. A praiseworthy stride no doubt.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWhile Ballroom e Youkoso does well on both a story and artistic front, the characters make a claim for the strongest part of the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nIt all centers on Tatara, the main protagonist of this dancing tale. Without much in the way of prospects, his humble beginnings make him a prime candidate for everlasting change. He has no experience whatsoever in this field, and he only joins the studio after watching the entrancing footage which Sengoku-san, the best ballroom dancer in the world, lent to him.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, Tatara\u2019s journey is far from an immediate rise to the top. He has sharp eyes that let him absorb information by studying those around him, and he has a keen knack for dance in general, but he begins at the bottom like any other jelly-legged nobody. Stamina issues, confidence issues. The anime makes it clear that Tatara is a bright young man with a good heart yet still needing all the help he can get.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s where the supporting cast members arrive. Ballroom dancing is a paired sport, so the people around Tatara offer their aid either directly or indirectly through mentoring, coaching, or battling. For instance, Shizuku will offer advice or encouragement from the sidelines, or Mako, with her own low self-esteem, will lean on him in her own time of need to challenge his perception.\\n\\n\r\nThen similarly, Tatara sees Sengoku-san and Kiyoharu as companions-in-arms (or rather legs) that inspire him. Sengoku-san represents his role model as he strives to be like him while also realizing how vastly inferior he is skill-wise. As for Kiyoharu, he wishes to compete alongside him someday soon, for they see in each other the same knack of passion and of potential.\\n\\n\r\nTruth be told, these side characters do not normally have the largest depth given the small amount of background exploration and the quickness of its delivery. But again, they exist mostly to compare and contrast with Tatara and show his strong points, his weak points, and everything in-between. Plus, Mako, Kiyoharu, and others still either receive their own time to shine or otherwise have portions of episodes dedicated to their past experiences and subsequent upbringing. That\u2019s more than enough for their supportive roles throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhat they and Tatara cannot fix, however, is his lacking foundation. In other words, Tatara\u2019s motivations and personal conflicts stem from a rather nonexistent place. His desire to change and to kickstart his static path is flimsy at best, and his background, home life, and general non-dance life is hardly (if ever) explored outright. So, while the path he takes develops him well, his core character never truly emerges.\\n\\n\r\nTo combat this problem, Ballroom e Youkoso doubles down on Tatara\u2019s character growth in the back half of the season. It does so not with its standard approach but instead by introducing into the fray a newcomer and, perhaps surprisingly, the second-most important person in the show: Chinatsu.\\n\\n\r\nChinatsu puts up a tough personality, dislikes dance, and maintains a lot of experience. Basically, she is the complete opposite of Tatara \u2013 naturally making her the perfect partner for him and him for her. They therefore don\u2019t quite get along (at first anyway), but they need each other more so than they realize. If for nothing else than to discover the \u201cother side\u201d of sorts.\\n\\n\r\nThese sides capture what they each fail to do. Tatara cannot lead; Chinatsu cannot follow. By mirroring their individual yet interlinked struggles in this manner, the show marks their bond as a stellar point of the series. They test and practice, fight and compromise. All in the name of leaving everything on the dance floor.\\n\\n\r\nAs this dichotomy plays out, he finally discovers the magic in his footing thanks to her uncompromising will, and she finally learns to trust others thanks to his unflinching determination. Thus, she goes from leading to following, and he goes from following to leading. Such a reversal in roles makes for an awesome dual character arc that they share together in splendid fashion.\\n\\n\r\nSimultaneously, more supporting characters arrive during this home stretch, too. Akira and her relationship with Chinatsu. Kugimiya and his internal frustrations. Once again, Ballroom e Youkoso enlists the help of these extras who both affect the mains in a worthwhile way and receive at least a modicum of attention to give their presence more than a passing stance.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of this two-cour season, Tatara, Chinatsu, and a host of other characters form a stalwart cast who not only contribute to the well-being of one another but also charge ahead with advancements of their own. They don\u2019t reach that top-tier spot, but strong execution in the writing can be seen readily enough.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of leading and following, Ballroom e Youkoso leads with several nice musical pieces and follows with some swell audio decisions as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe show kicks it off with its first opening track, \u201c10% roll, 10% romance\u201d. The rhythmic drums and the upbeat guitar build the foundation for this peppy song, and the lighter vocals form the mood equally as light. Better yet, the step-wise delivery and the multitude of pacing switch-ups coincide with that all-encompassing dancing motif, placing this OP into good graces.\\n\\n\r\nCome the second half of the anime, the second opening track, \u201cInvisible Sensation\u201d, replaces the first one. While it returns with a similar sense of instrumentation and singing, this new OP takes on a slightly different tone. A twinge of both passion and melancholy now exist in the composition as the hopeful arrangement carries on. While this track is somewhat of a downgrade, the nuanced shift in the overall feeling, to reflect the remainder of the season upon its arrival, can at least be appreciated.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cMaybe the next waltz\u201d isn\u2019t a statement but instead the title of the first ending track. Compared to its two OP counterparts, this piece invites the listener with gentleness aplenty. Piano keys and string instruments provide an orchestral base for a grander sound, but the chimes and general daintiness keep the song in check as its fantastical aura moves about softly on the ears. The main vocals dance along, the backing vocals uplift the track, and, in unison, they round out the rest of this unassuming melody.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the second ED, \u201cSwing heart direction\u201d combines a bit of each of the three songs heard already while carving out its own piece of the dance pie. Drums and guitar accompany a piano, working together and on their own, towards a sincere yet mellow angle. It doesn\u2019t quite dazzle as much as the other tracks, but its simplicity and (as it denotes) heart fill the song with a steady amount of emotion.\\n\\n\r\nBallroom e Youkoso also creates a bunch of sweet pieces for its original soundtrack in-between these OPs and these EDs. Dramatic tunes of violins and of pianos add the necessary weight to the more powerful moments, such as when Shizuku talks to Tatara about how he (and others) have already left an impression on her. A defined acoustic-guitar gets at a tensioned, almost sexy atmosphere when required. And hip-hop beats with a nearby saxophone push scenes along with a smooth, jazzy hand.\\n\\n\r\nThis diverse and intriguing OST is perhaps the best trait from the music-and-sound department, but the remaining elements deserve at least a shout-out, too. The anime demonstrates attention to detail with the squeaking of shoes on wooden flooring and, while the voice acting may not exactly enrapture, the ensemble cast provide very solid performances.\\n\\n\r\nAt the minimum, Chinatsu Akasaki as (coincidentally enough) Chinatsu displays a directness and a range of emotion that elevates the red-head above her peers. Alongside the strength of the audio direction overall, Ballroom e Youkoso caps off its production values with a lot of clout, indeed.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nSlap on me a bowtie and nickname me \u201cTango\u201d because I was a fan of this anime the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nThe gentlemen brought a lot. Tatara is an earnest fellow, and I like seeing him face his position with realism and guts. Gaju is at first a jerk, but he turns into a cool friend. And Kiyoharu is the quiet star, yet his wisdom and advice are honest and true. Each of the main ladies were a treat, too. Shizuku\u2019s alluring, thoughtful intimidation. Mako\u2019s tiny, cute smile. Chinatsu\u2019s tomboyish, fiery passion.\\n\\n\r\nThese characters are a ton of fun, and their rivalries and interactions translated into entertainment galore. I found myself rooting for and cheering on Tatara and Mako as their combined efforts led them to sincere happiness, and I invested emotions into Tatara and Chinatsu as they fought with everything they had.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, as someone without much interest in ballroom dancing, it kept me hooked. This sport is not technically a marvel, and I\u2019m certainly no expert in that field. Meaning, I\u2019m aware of its existence but I place myself in that group I described way earlier who truthfully cannot say it has landed on my radar in the past. Yet I\u2019m always open to trying out stories or premises that don\u2019t automatically fall into my favorite categories, and so I was pleasantly surprised that it basically never lost its luster and kept me engaged throughout its whole run.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I cannot forget to mention the other likable parts of this anime. The blonde Russian bombshell Marisa and the attractive Chizuru. The slight sparks of romance. The hilarious comedic segments throughout. Even if these parts weren\u2019t here within this anime, I would still be singing its praises \u2013 or, more relevantly, attempting a jig in its honor.\\n\\n\r\nBallroom e Youkoso impresses the judges and wows the onlookers with its moves. The audiovisual elements grab some attention, but the worthwhile setup, the strong character writing, and the huge amount of entertainment glide this project towards the front of the line. While not going everywhere or doing everything, it wins out regardless.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, ballroom dancing takes center stage, delivering a stout introduction to the sport and the benefits it brings, while also putting together a solid, exciting plot despite the occasional tactless \u201cjoke\u201d\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, wonderful designs, intriguing stylistic moments, and, for the complex dance numbers, both an avoidance of major mistakes and lots of creative liberties overcome some of the issues with reused segments\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, despite the weak motivations backing the core of Tatara\u2019s person, his growth throughout the season is reasonable and meaningful, his pairing with Chinatsu is stellar, and side cast members such as Mako and Kugimiya both support and improve\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Good, a collection of interesting OPs and EDs, a diverse OST, and some solid VA performances put the audio on the correct footing\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, waltzed right in and quickly became fun as it tangoed without end\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "\"Now that's what I call Sports Anime!\"  \r\nI cannot emphasize enough how wonderful this show was for me to watch. Until this past year I had not managed to enter the world of sports anime, and after devoting an entire season to exploring the genre in its various forms and series, I can definitively say that Ballroom e Youkoso (Welcome to the Ballroom) is one of my favorites and one of the most enjoyable by far. From basketball to rugby, ping pong to bicycle races, the realm of sports has all different kinds of appeal, however; Ballroom has something that is entirely unique toit: aesthetic. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I say this, I don't mean the art or animation--though I shall talk about that shortly. What I mean when I say aesthetic, is that the look of the competitors and exhibition of the dancing itself  is wholly important to the nature of the sport being examined here. Ballroom Dancing is a team (pair) sport about performing amazing physical feats and looking stunning while doing them with the utmost precision and technique. Though skeptical at first, I feel that this manga and subsequent anime adaption have done every thing in their power to show this to their audience. Though usually thought of as a activity for \"women, and old people with too much money and time on their hands,\" Ballroom manages to take every part of what makes an anime a \"sports\" anime and turn it into a show of beauty that appeals to a much wider audience than one may first think. \\n\\n\r\nAllow me to be the first to bring up last year's Yuri!!! On Ice, which disappoints severely in this regard. As a result of this past disappointment, I had a great deal misgivings about Ballroom and was worried that it would end on a less impressive note; however, after finding the manga at my local bookstore and deciding to pick it up and give it a perusal before the anime began, my fears were wiped away. What I got was beautiful illustrations, even development for the characters, and a story that didn't understate the work and effort and devotion they needed to be competitive dancers. Ballroom Dancing is a sport, this series wasn't going to let you forget that, and I love it all the more because of it.\\n\\n\r\nI have few points to bring up on the technical side of the series: \\n\\n\r\nStory: It's a tale as old as sports series about a boy who just wants something to give his life a little more meaning, finds his way into a dance school accidentally, and then finds himself exploring the world of a sport that he wouldn't have given a second glance at if not for the people he meets there. Now this is just how the story starts and as our leading boy Tatara explores the world of dance and struggles to find his dance we are treated to an interesting take on the typical beginner's story. Maybe nothing too flashy, but definitely nothing to sneeze at either.\\n\\n\r\nArt: People complain about the necks a lot, but this is dance and posture is consistently pointed out, so this is no doubt a creative choice on the part of the creators. The animation is lack luster at it's worst, and ASTOUNDING at it's best. While it would have been nice to have seen the animation be its best the entire time, very few seasonal anime manage to be as consistent, so some lee-way is there. Perfect? No, in fact it has a habit of letting you down too early in some crucial instances, but I believe it serves it's purpose more than well enough. You can follow the movements of the dancers almost always fluidly and that has to count for something.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: A++ Points for Unison Square Garden for both openings and Sing Sing Sing as part of the soundtrack. I don't think anyone would complain about the sound. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I found them to be unique and likeable. None of them were one-time friends or adversaries, and each of them had a story to tell and a role to play that would have changed the story entirely had they not been present. Some might find the protagonist a bit hard to be initially invested in, but time makes him grow on you, and until then the supporting cast is always fun. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Welcome to the Ballroom is an exemplary show that incorporates the beauty of ballroom dancing with the intensity of sports anime while balancing a well-put-together cast and enjoyable story. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is a very easy 24 episodes to recommend. I look forward to continuing to follow the manga and will be overjoyed should we ever get the honor of a future season of the anime.",

            "content": "So, personally, I was quite excited to start on this show and it really comprehended my excitement in the first two episodes. After this though, I became a little disappointed in the executing of the show and found myself missing some elements, which I think of as necessary in a show about ballroom dancing. Of course, some of these elements are clearly my personal taste and they do not make the show less entertaining. I will praise that the studio did an amazing job nonetheless, but maybe my expectations were just too high.\r\nThe second half of the show was way better than the first, introducingsome new characters, which helped the main character along with his development. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are decent enough to be enjoyable. The main character can come across as whiny and a coward, but that\u2019s just the way he is and he is eventually developing those weaknesses into strong points. \\n\r\nIn the second half, you have Chinatsu who helps him with learning more about himself. I really liked her character. She has a nasty personality, but I really enjoy characters who stir some life into the cast. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, the art and animation look amazing as expected of this studio. The thing what I was most displeased by was the number of dancing animations or the lack of. Especially in the first half, they show little to no dancing, while this is a show about ballroom dancing. The second half makes it a little better, but the amount of still frames is still quite a lot. I don\u2019t hate the still frames, but I don\u2019t want them to take over.\\n\r\nI really missed seeing all the choreographic of the dances. Of course, I don\u2019t expect them to show us all the dances of all the competitors since they\u2019re a lot of them. But I wish they would show some complete dances to really show of the beauty of ballroom dancing. \\n\\n\r\nFor me there were only the main characters; it was like the other people didn\u2019t even exist, even though they were competing in the same competition. I would have loved to see more dances of different couples to show us more of how high the level is for the main characters to dance to. I completely missed the rivalry feeling in the first half. \\n\r\nThe second half did it a little better by introducing us to a few more couples, but still, it wasn\u2019t enough for me. \\n\r\nI know it would be a lot of work to make more characters and show their dances as well, so this is a personal touch I would have just loved to see. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that bothered me a bit was the little explanation of the sport itself. To me, it felt like there wasn\u2019t really any explanation on the dances itself or how the steps really are. Maybe a little information on the music would have been nice as well. \\n\r\nShowing us a little more of the choreographic and how the dances really work would have made me enjoy the show more as I would have had a better understanding of it all.\\n\r\nAlso, a noticeable thing would be that it isn\u2019t really explained what the judges look for in a dance. The show makes it same as the judges just look for their personal preference, which would make them bias as hell. \\n\\n\r\nSo, these things are personal, but I believe if they included some of my points here then the show would have become a much more enjoyable watch than before. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, I still enjoyed this show to a certain extent. \\n\\n\r\nSo, as a recommendation, I would say, only if you really like your sports anime. Other than that, don\u2019t come like me for the ballroom dancing and the technical side of it, since that isn\u2019t really in this show. \\n",

            "content": "This review contains mild spoilers.\r\nI just finished it and I felt the urge to write a review.\r\nNot feeling like doing an aspect-on-aspect one tho, I just wanna let my emotions flow, so, oh boy, was this a compelling series, at the start, little did I know that it would grow this much on me, I even thought of it as an Ippo rip-off, not because of nothing, the start of both series is pretty much identical, Tatara is a bullied, shy guy with nothing quite remarkeable in his school life, saved and inspired by a pro-sportsman and introduced to his practice in a way thatmakes him think about becoming someone with it, the same as Ippo did, looking up to a contemporary too.\\n\\n\r\nBut then the series started progressing, and quietly started to demolish my expectations of it, the character dynamics, facilitated by the sport, became something absolutely important, and while Tatara was still a weak person, you could start to see his progress as his new experiences guided him, and that his relationship with the characters appearing, specially Mako, were something that the show took a big time in evolving and letting the viewer get what each of them felt in every step they took. It was fascinating to see all those eyes put in this totally incomplete person, but for all the wrong reasons! The series doesn't have problem acknowledging how bad Tatara is, and that's what made his development something so special, he doesn't get better by himself, but by this character dynamics I talked about before. You can understand, by the things he passes through (and not in some intense training animation sequences), the way he goes building his dancer life, and that works pretty well with what Hyodo says about Tatara being someone who dances through his emotions; the people in his life construct him, and it was kinda beautiful to watch, not magical improvement here. \\n\\n\r\nBut hey, that was the first half, and it was good, but while the characters keep being so important, the second half is superior in all ways, giving Tatara a partner was something necessary, but giving him such a partner, such a human being was a perfect move by the writers, we as an audience get to know Tatara defied by something so different to everything else he has handled, and even if he keeps being that humble guy, his dynamics with Chinatsu are complex and well explored. That theme became the main plot point of the second half, and god was it resolved, the climax reached in episode 23 was absolutely satisfying, watching them finally become a couple after all that character study in the previous episodes made me feel rewarded and hit me hard, I was foolish at comparing it to Hajime no Ippo, the relationships here evolved in a way the individual sport of boxing cannot characterize, and well, I should stop comparing since both shows went in opposite ways, so hell, the way they embraced their feelings and finally accepted their differences and problems felt absolutely as their completion of their way to the start line, and it gives proper conclusion, but also a new start to hope something big.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is consistent, the exposition made in the dances may put some people off, but I think the way they did it made them achieve their objective of getting to know their characters at all their faces.\\n\\n\r\nNot saying this is a perfect piece of media though, the dances don't feel like dances most of the time, and the animation does its job greatly just like 4 times in the whole series, there are some horrible cgi models that appear in every damn dance, and sometimes the sound, while beautiful, isn't put in the most desirable way, given the possibility of using that many genres and styles, I hoped they gave the music some big importance, but they didn't, it just affects the way the dance must go, and sometimes they'll put their background music over dances that don't have anything to do with it. Apart from that, those 4 scenes were spectacular, and the background music is cute and the Openings and Endings are all great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, sure it is somewhat flawed as any audiovisual composition, but it is incredibly fulfilling, and incredibly great at the things it knows how to do.\\n\r\nLoveable AF.",

The part i most loved is prolly the slow paced ch. development: weather it is tad of romance, skills,ability, trusting each other,believing,recovery and the spirit.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, i hope there's gonna be a S2 for the season's best rom/sports animu :)",

            "content": "\"This adaptation is like a painting, it has a beautiful frame that could be the story itself presented and maintained throughout the show, and the remarkable artistic quality of the main characters enclosed in this frame that is compared to the hypnotic and vivid sunset that fascinates our eyes and earns our total attention.\"\r\nAt first, you may be a bit skeptical after reading the summaries of this anime, the central theme is a bit unusual, a ballroom anime. Also, you can consider, a dance competition, another anime about some championships or tournaments that could be similar to any other sports anime, but you could bewrong. Ballroom e Youkoso is a fantastic adaptation that combines excellent storytelling with fabulous art design and captivates viewers by making them want more. Sadly, not all is perfect, the use of CGI could be weird and creates an ugly contrast between the characters' art and the scene background but it isn't a big issue.  \\n\\n\r\nStory 8\\n\\n\r\nThe anime has two main story arcs. The first one, the introduction of Tatara Fujita, the main character. An important fact is the display of Tatara's problems and insecurity. In addition, this arc presents the secondary characters, such as Kiyoharu, Shizuku, Mako, and Gaju. These characters enhance the narrative, the dynamics of the dance and the tournaments. They create an initial rivalry between Tatara, but the most exciting part is that they are still mates and support each other in their way. In other words, it is a healthy rivalry that is needed to help in the growth of Tatara and does not conceive the effect of a villain or a pompous competitor as we can see in the typical sports adaptations. Simultaneously, this arc reveals the differences that exist between the characters and establishes a challenging atmosphere among all of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc presents the other main character, Chinatsu Hiyama, and you can feel the progression of Tatara. Chinatsu is the opposite of Tatara. She has a dazzling personality, is rebellious and very strong. She also has a lot of experience in dance, so on many occasions, she shows her displeasure about the way of leading proposed by Tatara. She can not understand Tatara's personality. However, their relationship turned up due to Tatara's personality. For my eyes, Chinatsu is the perfect complement for Tatara.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, you can see a new secondary character, Kugimiya Masami. He is a shadowy character who could be Tatara's antagonist. For several viewers, including me, Kugimiya could fit the description of an odious competitor with some secrets. This figure is very dark and mysterious. He hates Tatara, and even the art portrays him with a faint aura. However, after a closer look, this character has been affected by several \"life\" problems that could be a reflection of Tatara if he abandoned his passion for dancing and improving. Kugimiya even compared himself to Tatara, and that bothered him more. All those elements created a beautiful story with a good rhythm, excellent narrative and with outstanding characters that can feel real.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, the standard sports anime could not cope with Ballroom and Youkoso. The series has everything: A story of high quality, with a good pacing, realistic characters, sadness, joy, need, frustration, etc. The anime emphasizes concepts such as trust between couples, their understanding, and conviction. We can observe the constant need to overcome and the hard work required to achieve a change both personally and competitively.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has two scenarios. The first, the interaction of the characters outside the \"ballroom.\" A rational world where the characters are beings with needs, problems, and feelings. The second world is inside the ballroom. A place with its own sets of rules where the score and the leader-companion relationship matter. This ambiance adds pressure and rivalry to the story, creates a dynamic where feelings of the characters bloom. Maybe my criteria could be biased since I have dance competition experience. However, seeing the relationship between partner and leader brought me many good and bad memories such as the foot pain after an event =D. To rephrase it, Tomo was able to convey those feelings to the audience, and that made me feel very happy because it stands out the realism.\\n\\n\r\nThere are still some problems with the story, however. The most visible is the lack of a real ending. Tomo fell ill, so she could not advance in the manga story. The animation exceeds the progress of manga story, so the conclusion of the adaptation could be original compared to the continuation of the manga, and it felt a bit rushed. Therefore, there may be reasonable speculation about when, or if, the date of the second season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8\\n\\n\r\nThe adaptation has a good number of characters. Perhaps the most relevant is the personality of the couples in competition. For example, the pair of Tatara in the first arc is utterly different if compared to the second arc because the couple has a distinct personality and that reflects the way the couple dance and act. For example, Mako is more delicate and shy compared to Chinatsu, who is more rebellious and strong. I'm sure that Tatara will continue to grow in the manga, and it is likely that a relationship between Chinatsu and Tatara will arise, but we can not rule out a possible attraction between Tatara and Shizuku.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters:\\n\\n\r\nTatara Fujita. He is a shy and insecure person who cares for everyone and, in particular, for his partner. Tatara was looking for a place to fit in, and the dance was a door of change for him. However, he is in constant development, his features remain constant, but explode during competitions. Maybe this character is a bit complex, but that is what makes it real.\\n\\n\r\nChinatsu Hiyama. Even if she was added halfway through the entire adaptation, her impact is gigantic. The personality of Chinatsu changed the dynamics of the narrative and directly affected Tatara's character. She is a rebel, strong, and has a lot of experience in dancing. She does not visualize Tatara as a good leader, sometimes she tries to follow him, but everything ends in constant frustration. However, she gives Tatara a chance to the point that both fight hard and evolve. It is a character with whom I feel connected, and I think there is a lot to see about its complexity.\\n\\n\r\nKiyoharu Hyoudou: You can say that he is the best dancer in the series. He is very talented and may be Tatara's main rival in the future of the story. He does not have any opponent that overcomes him. However, he helps and guides Tatara as he considers him as a rival with enormous potential and with a lot of raw skill.\\n\\n\r\nShizuku Hanaoka: She is the best companion. However, it could be said that she depends on Kiyoharu's leadership. She finds Tatara's unusual dance skills to the point that she decides to wait for his evolution and supports him. It is still too early to see if there are sentiments of her towards Tatara.\\n\\n\r\nThe remaining characters are essential as well, but I don't want to prolong any further.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound 8\\n\\n\r\nBallroom e Youkoso is quite impressive regarding sound and illustrations. The art follows the dynamics of dance and is quite clean. The movement and the characters, in general, is real. Usually, the scenes make the eyes focus on the pairs because of the color palette and the details. However, a high level of detail and quality isn't maintained in the surroundings (CGI use). Besides, if the eyes change from the principal observation point, you will notice some awful disparity between the surroundings and the couples in some scenes, do not let that change your decision towards the anime. Several good animations do not have the budget to fill the whole scene with a high artistic quality; sadly this one is the case. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, some camera angles can give the impression of disproportion because the postures of the different dancing styles are complicated, but it must be taken into account that they are positions with a high degree of realism. The color palette is very vivid and uses a high contrast of colors where you can see the beauty of the couples, and this marks the details and character traits of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the sound, it's awesome. The series uses a vibrant score. In addition, it is listened to in a very soft way and keeps the rhythm and the action going. This helps the movement of the scenes especially the dances. The OPs and EDs are excellent and enjoyable. In my personal opinion, OP1 and ED2 are the best.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9\\n\\n\r\nI can not complain about this show; it is very entertaining. The narration is very fluid with an acceptable rhythm, creating the perfect environment for any spectator. The characters are complex and stand out. However, for some anime fans, it is possible that this type of genre is not pleasant or will complain by the lame use of the CGI,  but it is not a reason to overlook this fantastic adaptation. I'll be waiting for a continuation of the manga, and I hope that in the next few years the animation of Ballroom and Youkoso will continue.",

            "content": "Competition is a beautiful thing. It makes us strive to accomplish, to win, and hope that we can simply be good at something in our lives. When it comes to expressing talent, we try to be the show-off and express it like a form of art. For a guy named Tatara Fujita, he just wants to prove to the world that he can be good at something. That is, one day\u2026he discovers the world of ballroom dancing.\r\nWatching Ballroom e Youkoso (Welcome to the Ballroom) feels like taking a journey down memory lane. I\u2019m talking about the type of memory lane where you were once akid and wanted to prove everyone you had talent in something. Academics, sports, art, acting, singing. Just anything in general that make your friend go \u201cwow, I didn\u2019t know you could do that!\u201d As such, this anime is one that I found remarkably realistic and relatable. The first few episodes doesn\u2019t take long to establish the principle cast along with its intention.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be honest here. Tatara is a character that won\u2019t be very easy to accept for most people at first glance. He has a meek personality and seems to overestimate himself on certain circumstances. This is shown in the beginning when Tatara expresses to professional dancer Sengoku that he wants to be a pro rather than just to dance. His initial attitude makes him look like a fool as dancing isn\u2019t just something that can perfected like a click of a switch. My impression of Tatara made me realize that while he sets high expectations for himself, he does have potential but needs the right people and time to unlock it. Luckily, Tatara gets the opportunity at the Ogawara Dance Studio where other talented dancers gather to perfect their work. From the studio, Tatara also meets the very talented and beautiful Shizuku. She becomes a source of inspiration for Tatara as he strives to improve and become a pro. Throughout this show, Tatara embraces the art of ballroom dancing and becomes very determined to prove himself. From an amateur to an inspiring ballroom dancer, his character can really grow to people as we see his progress.\\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling builds on many fronts although most of it still follows Tatara and his journey. He deals with personal issues, social problems, and also establishes rivalries with certain characters he meets. At the same time, an important part of this show involve him building important relationships with others. Two particular characters stands out the most: Mako Akagi and Chinatsu Hiyama. As dancing partners, Tatara\u2019s relationship with both of these girls vary in attitude. Mako and Tatara has a friendly relationship that is based on trust, respect, and strong spirit. On the other hand, Tatara and Chinatsu\u2019s relationship is more borderline towards competitiveness. Not to mention, Chinatsu already has a dancing background and doesn\u2019t tolerate a weak partner. Throughout the anime, we see how Chinatsu begins to accept him more with their growing trust. In respect, Tatara also develops as a person as he crafts his own dancing style so that it\u2019s not just his partner carrying their dances. Whether he realizes it or not, Tatara even has influence on others. This includes making Mako realize how skilled she really is, restoring Chinatsu\u2019s love for dancing, and even influencing Shizuku to improve herself to be better. In retrospect, this anime steps over the line to make Tatara a more likeable character as time goes on.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can\u2019t really say all the main cast gets decent screen time and development. While Shizuku is Tatara\u2019s initial inspiration, she doesn\u2019t get much highlight later on in this show. Don\u2019t expect this anime to focus much on Tatara\u2019s love life either. While it\u2019s obvious that Tatara crushes over Shizuku from the beginning, the show makes it clear that she prefers dancing rather than finding a boyfriend. This also applies to Tatara\u2019s other dancing partners so if romance is something on your mind, then look elsewhere. Also, be aware that this anime focuses a lot on dancing. By a lot, I mean a LOT with all types of dances, music, and style. If you\u2019re not a fan of dancing, it may take some time to enjoy this show. Ballroom dancing is portrayed as a fierce competition on the dance floor with some episodes dedicating their entire time to it. Luckily, this anime is quite a faithful adaptation for what it had to work with. With only some minor differences, it\u2019s an anime that really made me glad it got adapted. However, there are times that I wish the anime picked up the pace with its extensive background storytelling, especially in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Production I.G., this was really the number one choice. They are known for making other anime that involve competition come to life. (ex. Haikyu, All Out!, Kuroko no Basket) For this particular anime, they leave a memorable impression with the art style and character designs. The biggest selling point is the smooth camera angles and timings. When the competition gets fierce, it really draws out the talents of the dancers with their body movements. Each movement is precisely timed to show their potential with colorful aesthetics. It further amplifies them through clever facial expressions. The dancing outfits in this anime are also memorable for their coloring and hair style, in particular for the female characters. It\u2019s not to be interpreted as fan service but rather a work of art. On the other hand, there are some body parts in this anime that can be distracting. The one most worth mentioning is the overly extensive necks that can make viewers point fingers at.\\n\\n\r\nAt the core of its technical feature is the music. It\u2019s what makes the ballroom dancing come to life along with its vivid choreography. The anime mixes in a variety that includes jazz, latin, classic, and among others. Director Yoshimi Itazu really made an impression through his work by allowing the music to do the storytelling on many occasions. Without words, many of the dancing segments feels like a dream and as if time itself stopped to showcase the characters\u2019 talents. The music supplements that with its directing. Voice character mannerism is also well performed with characters like Chinatsu, Hyoudou, and the Akagi siblings. Both the OP and ED theme songs are also worth listening to for their rhythm.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show with a fierce competitive energy, this one might seem to be intimidating to watch at first. However, it\u2019s a show that I can recommend to anyone even if its selling points doesn\u2019t hit all the marks. From its character cast to storytelling, Ballroom e Youkoso is a well-adapted manga that focuses on what it intended to without betraying expectations. Sure, some characters are not as well focused compared to the others. There are also times when you wish the story can just move its pace faster. However, it\u2019s still a show that gives competition a powerful meaning.\\n",

            "content": "Have I properly read the manga for Welcome to the Ballroom? No, but I have seen it; I\u2019ve seen more than enough to know that the original creator put a ton of work and passion into his manga. While you could make the same argument for the anime, you can\u2019t argue about the anime\u2019s budget. Yup, that\u2019s right ladies and gentlemen. Production I.G. themselves finally made what I think we can all agree to be a BAD ADAPTATION.  \r\nThis anime has the sleek character designs of Haikuu!, the art style of Haikyuu!, the score of Haikuu!, but not the animation. What made sports showslike Haikuu! and all others like it so good was that the animation team behind it really brought their respective sport to life. As much as I hated Kuroko no Basket, I\u2019m still able to acknowledge how the over-the-top animation really made the characters abilities and overall athletic prowess pop. As a shut-in otaku myself, I\u2019ve never liked sports nor the jocks who played them, but the detailed animation of Haikyuu! really got me to notice how taxing the sport was on their bodies. You could tell by their shoulders and knees how exhausted they were getting, and not long after I came to see the care put into the animation, I gained genuine respect for the teams who really worked hard for victory. Ballroom has none of that. Most of the dance sequences are still images, and the background dancers are always ugly CG. The motivation of the MC, Tatara, was that he was a nobody, and seeing professional dancers do their thing made him realize just how much he wanted to be \u201cseen\u201d himself. That\u2019s a good motivation and all, but when we, the audience, see all this shitty animation and out-of-place CG all we can really think is, \u201cYou were inspired by THAT?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s sad too because when you watch either OP as well as a quick (nine second) scene in episodes 11 and 24 you can really see what could have been. It\u2019s a shame Production I.G. didn\u2019t have the budget to make this show at it\u2019s full potential. \\n\\n\r\nOther than the constant stain of the lack of a budget, the show is actually really good. The characters are likable and hatable when they need to be, and the story progresses at a, sometimes slow, but overall reasonable pace. This pacing really allows you to notice the changes in the characters\u2019 respective dancing styles and moral outlook on the sport. Their relationships are charming and you can see where everyone\u2019s coming from in any decision making process. Some flashback-backstory in the latter half of the show is a little forced, but that doesn\u2019t mean the actual content of said flashbacks were bad at all. The voice actors and actresses are definitely not getting paid enough; some of these characters, especially the cute girls, had me down for their characters on their voices alone. That on top of the already competent script was great to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I\u2019d like to address that good old Production I.G. Magic that Haikyuu! and it\u2019s contemporaries had: \\n\r\nIt\u2019s there, but the animation is still a real hindrance. There\u2019s scenes throughout the show that really make you get along with the emotions and the themes the show is presenting, and you almost feel inspired. Again, I imagine the source material was really something special. It\u2019s a shame the anime wasn\u2019t able to give it justice. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I\u2019d say give it a watch, but don\u2019t hesitate to drop it. I don\u2019t really believe in the \u201cthree episode rule\u201d because while some shows put everything they have to offer in episode one, others sometimes don\u2019t reveal all their cards until the double digits. For Ballroom, I\u2019d say that if you don\u2019t like it by episode six, don\u2019t worry about it.",

            "content": "Anime  Has often surprised me with the fact that how unpredictable it can really get. We often think to ourselves, that having watched so many shows, nothing can really surprise us anymore, But yet again, we are proved wrong with every new season. Take Fune wo amu for example, I never thought i  will watch an anime about dictionaries, And yet I found myself loving it more and more. And now we have Ballroom, An anime which explores the world of ballroom dancing, A sport which is perhaps is one of the most peculiar one out there , and perhaps  the mostelegant one too, And surprisingly makes it more interesting than you might really expect it to be.\\n\\n\r\nSports anime have existed pretty much since the beginning of  the medium itself. From football to basketball, and even Shogi, We have seen almost all kind of games, And its not wrong to say that these anime, rather than the game, are now all about building the hype and adrenaline rush within the viewer, and keep them captivated.  Welcome to ballroom explores the world of ballroom dancing, which as a sport is not really that well known to many, But Rather than just being all about the game itself, Ballroom is somehow able to bring out the true beauty of Dancing, Not as a sport, But more as a form of art. It also gives the competitive vibe of the game as we would expect from any other sport anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow,When it comes to the story, Sports anime are not really known for their story lines. Of course we have seen sport  anime, with some pretty amazing storylines, But as mentioned before, Many of them are really all about sports, Which is not really a bad thing. Ballroom also offers little in this department, What we see is the generic run off the mill plot line that we we have really seen a hell lot of a times before. But, what really differentiates a good sport anime from other genre of anime, is that how it overcomes the lack of a proper story line , by offering the viewer something  more than that, That is , The real excitement of the game itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime can be simply broken down into two parts here, The first one is more focused towards Tatara, The MC, as a a learner, who is slowly trying to grasp the concept of dancing . He is just a newbie who is learning , and is not someone you will refer to as a good dancer. The second half on the other hand is about how overcomes his weaknesses and learns more about himself . How he also tries to prove himself as a worthy dancer and  built his identity in this world of dancing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, universally are known as the most important part of any anime , However, In such anime, their role is of much more importance than others. Ballroom shows The  conflicts, self doubt,excitement, and of course, the anxiety, that the Characters hide behind their smiling faces on the stage.\\n\\n\r\n The main character Tatara, has been struggling to find his purpose in life, more than anyone, he wants to prove his talents to the world, but is confused about how to do so, And he finds His own way in this world of Dance. He still  is new to the world of dancing, and really has no special talent for doing it either. But he still works hard to become the very best and most of all, he is portrayed  a strong willed and determined person and  not as a wimp. However, It doesn't hide the fact that he is really just a generic character that we might have seen before . However, as mentioned before, it is the second half from where things change. Introduction of Chinatsu is The most important part of the second half, As she is not just the new partner of Tatara, But a person who completely changes him and also the world around him. She is much like a tomboy, who uses harsh words , but cares about Tatara more Than anyone else. She is an experienced dancer herself, But her inability to become a partner makes her really no different from Tatara, With is inexperience in leading. And This mismatched combo is perhaps The best part of the entire show itself\\n\\n\r\nNow, talking about characters, we should also see that the other characters are not overshadowed in any way, In fact they actually shine out the most in the first half of the show, quite literally. Both the girls, Mako and shizuka, have played important roles in the development of Tatara as dancer. They have both played as his partners and have been major part of the story. Sengoku san served as his mentor and have taught him everything he knows. These other characters do have played major roles, but just in support of Tatara, That is for the most part, and we do not really get to see a lot about them, But as said there presence is not overshadowed. In fact, one of my most favorite parts of the show was the Mako Tatara solo, in which Mako was the main presence and she quite literally shone beautifully  like a flower.\\n\\n\r\nLike other Sports anime, Ballroom also brings along with it , some in depth trivia and facts about the sport. It just shows us how watching people dance and actually being on the stage is completely different experiences.  .It also goes a bit deeper by showing us the psychological  battles that these people go through while on the stage, The anime shows how much does an actual person goes through when on a stage, The split second decisions and of course To maintain  The focus on the partner. But more than that, It shows the true happiness These people feel while on the stage. Honestly, The show does and excellent job of portraying all these complex feelings of these people, without being too forceful with it. \\n\\n\r\nNow when we talk about dance, music is something which naturally comes to our minds along with it, So as one would think in such anime music of course would play in important role. Now Both the Op are very good in my opinion, They tend to be fast paced and built the excitement within the viewer. The music played within the scenes, That is during the dance routines, is somewhat overshadowed, Now the anime is focused on dance, but music is as important, The anime uses different styles of music and effects for different  dance routines, however the music sometimes, just tends to get a bit overshadowed, which is not really good. Both the ED are also pretty fine, Tho second one is my favorite. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, I guess, is just pretty average. The anime uses a bright color palette , Which fits quite well with the series, But there is really nothing special heer, That is , until the things get on the stage. The beautiful animations during the dance literally make the characters and music , come to life. The smooth movement, the Beautiful special effects just makes things even more beautiful. The character design is also pretty fine, but thins get real when they are on stage, The facial expressions they make are more than enough to convey their satisfaction and happiness. Overall, The art section is really well done .\\n\\n\r\nNow dance is something which we would expect to see in a sports anime, But don't let that fact deceive you, Because this show is nothing less than any other sport show out there. Its fast paced, beautifully animated and gets you excited and makes you wish for even more.   It is something  everyone should experience once. It shows something like dance, which we might not really think of often, in a way we would  never expect. It does have its flaws, however, in total, Its an enjoyable  ride, that everyone should try.",

            "content": "Now that, is seriously an unexpected but a very pleasant surprise. Damn, that is something really lighting up! Dancing TV shows have really been a trend lately, but what I\u2019ve just witnessed is something much more impressive. The anime is 100% about ballroom dancing exclusively.\r\nThis is the very first anime series dedicated to professional ballroom dancing, if I\u2019m correct, hell, that\u2019s the first anime dedicated to dancing at all! There\u2019s been lots of shows about all other kinds of sports like basketball, football, baseball, tennis, volleyball, swimming,\u2026 and tooons of others, and finally, FINALLY, we\u2019ve got to ballroom dancing, which can\u2019t make me anything buthappy. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, being a ballroom dancer myself for 15 years, I\u2019m SUPER DUPPER OVERMYHEAD EXCITED seeing my favorite sport at last getting an anime adaptation, and though it\u2019s only\u2019ve been a couple episodes, but trust the expert, judging from what I saw \u2013 this is gonna be EPIC.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is more than simple. A total newbie is been dragged into the world of dancing by some stranger who happens to be an expert and will teach our hero and bla-bla-bla\u2026 Now agree, that is mostly common plot thing to almost every sports anime, not to mention that our main character is making a tremendous progress since the very beginning of his trainings\u2026 aaand that\u2019s all because he\u2019s been charmed by a beautiful classmate girl who also happens to be into dancing (actually he was just stalking after her and that\u2019s how it all happened, but that\u2019s not a thing). The thing is that the creators have really made a COLOSSAL work by showing every single move of the dancers that we see, such detailed, every singe line and angle of their body as they stand prepared to waltz, every dynamic motion as they dance cha-cha, and every emotion on their faces \u2013 from serious and confident tango to romantic and sensual rumba.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, all I can tell about an art style is \u201cFANTASTIC\u201d. Though I\u2019m not a fan of frequent usage of 3D in anime (more a fan of an old animating style), this one does deserve to be noticed and praised for its aliveness, vividness and multicolourness.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime will amaze you with musical compositions \u2013 rhythmic and inflammatory \u2013 they will make you dance even sitting on a chair. From opening to ending \u2013 this is a trip to a wonderland that will drag you into an unrestrained yet splendid whirlpool of dance sports and you WILL beg for MORE. Not to mention flawlessly looking girls who will make your heart beat speed up twenty times faster;)\\n\\n\r\nThe show is expected to be on the level of \u201cYour Lie in April\u201d that startled us with great characters, its own unique drawing style and a feeling of full immersion in deep waters of music; this is what you SHOULD look forward to from \u201cWelcome to the Ballroom\u201d series,\u2026 but about dancing.\\n",

            "content": "Ballroom e Youkoso\u2019s hype sank faster than 2-ton anchor. And it\u2019s easy to see why. The show is plagued by lackluster animation and unlikeable characters. \r\nBallroom\u2019s biggest disappointment is the extreme lack of any actual dancing (or ballroom-styled music). Shows can survive dull characters and repetitive melodrama if they deliver something else worth sticking around for, but Ballroom failed on its biggest promise - to see some dancing. \r\nInstead of dancing, we get drawn stills and repetitive commentary from the audience about how great someone is or how much they improved or the differences between one dancing style and another, but never see any ofit. And any dancing we do see looks more like chickens flapping around than anything graceful. \\n\\n\r\nThe lack of any actual dancing also removes a good deal of tension from the show, a staple of sports anime. Instead of seeing action, we hear commentary on the action, breaking any chance of creating tension whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nBad animation isn\u2019t the only reason behind the show\u2019s lack of tension. While we\u2019re watching our dancing stills and hearing people talk about them, we have very little clue about the sport itself. The points system, what judges are looking for, and any rules are only touched upon. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are as disappointing as the animation. When Tatara\u2019s not complaining, he acts a sponge that exists to soak up other characters\u2019 drama. In the first half of the season, he\u2019s at least a boring-but-nice guy, but in the second cour, he spends most of this time failing to take action and complaining a lot. \\n\\n\r\nOddly, Tatara is also the local psychologist - I guess. Not only is it weird that these characters (specifically, Shizuku and Mako) start blabbing their issues to someone they barely know, but they never actually talk to the person they\u2019re having an issue with. The drama between these two girls and their dancing partners magically disappear without direct confrontation, which is not only confusing, but also misses on potential drama and character growth. \\n\\n\r\nThe trend continues in the second half. Akira and Chinatsu get two episodes dedicated to their past history - but hardly interact with each other in the present. Instead, we get a clunky two-episode flashback from Akira\u2019s point of view and jump back into the present without furthering Chinatsu\u2019s and Akira\u2019s relationship in any way whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nChinatsu is flat-out mean at times, and Tatara is flat-out pathetic. Their nonsense gets old after the first 10 episodes of the same thing over and over. On top of that, our supposed antagonist-rivals, Kugimiya and Akira, were made so sympathetic, that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever wanted the leads to lose so badly before. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d say the odd, creepy fanservice moments earlier on where we\u2019re supposed to be entertained by a highschool girl getting peeped on and embarrassed by an older man is unnecessary. But this anime never had much going for it. \\n\\n\r\nBallroom had so much promise. An anime about a visual sport? I was hoping for Yuri on Ice 2.0. By the end, I was hoping for anything remotely interesting to happen - including seeing a full dancing routine (crazy, right?). Instead, Ballroom provides little dancing, little tension, and lots of repetition and unlikeable characters.\\n",

            "content": "I couldn't wait to start watching Ballroom e Youkoso, but it really missed the mark. While it has a lot of problem, I'll focus on two big ones: failure as a sports anime and a boring lead. \r\nI love sports anime. The drama. The tears. The tension. I love Ping Pong the Animation, Haikyuu!!, and the Yuri on ICE!!!. But Ballroom fails at a fundamental level when it comes to being a \"sports anime\". \r\nFirst, almost none of dancing is actually animated, which is pretty surprising considering Production I.G. also brought us Haikyuu!!. Sure it's difficult to animate characters in motion, but YOI dedicated alot of screen-time to skating routines (maybe even too much). When I started a ballroom dancing anime, I expected more than a few seconds of footwork every episode. Instead I got a bunch of stills with long-necked characters bearing frankly creepy smiles and long-winded narrations about why a character is dancing well or not. Later we also see weird metaphors that meant the anime lowered its budget or author went on a existential bender. Some of these ended up looking so silly that I laughed so hard I cried. \\n\\n\r\nWithout clearly defined rules (like get the ball over the net) and with no visuals to help you out, the audience must rely wholly on narration to build tension, and it's pretty boring. There wasn't a single moment where I was holding my breath, waiting to see if our character would win. Even Kuroko No Basket (which I wasn't a huge fan of) built a lot of tension in games, as all sports anime should. The lack of rules and dancing animation sucked away the tension. Therefore Ballroom, as a sports anime, fails. \\n\\n\r\nBut wait! Some sport anime, like Ballroom, are character focused, so the tension comes from the characters, right? Sure. I love Ping Pong The Animation. During the show's final match you don't even care who wins because the tension is invested in character's growth. Yuri on ICE!!! and Free! are also character-focused sport anime, but both build more tension than Ballroom.\\n\\n\r\nWhy?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are more developed and more interesting than Ballroom's cast. Fujita Tatara is about as interesting as a piece of wet toast. He whines about not being a good enough dancer for 24 episodes (basically the typical shounen plea of \"I need to get stronger). Tatara is on trend with \"nicer shounen leads\", but he falls flat when compared to, say, Hinata from Haikyuu!! or Midoriya from Boku no Hero Academia. It would've been less irritating if he another conflict he could've overcome.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the side characters have potential, they get stuck talking to Tatara, which makes for lack lust conversations. Instead of seeing two characters with tension or conflict duke it out, both characters talk to Tatara about their problems, which results in disappointing resolutions to character conflicts. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of all of this, there are some unnecessary fan service scenes and narrative issues that make this anime subpar. It can't hurt to watch if you like sports anime, but you're not missing anything special if you don't. Despite front-loading the first episodes with fan service, the first dvd didn't sell well, which doesn't surprise me.\\n\\n\r\nThe last episodes made it terribly difficult to root for what I liked to call the \"limp noodle and wild mare pairing\" over the other pairings, who all proved more interesting and complex.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was so cheesy and predictable it could've made a Disney character puke. But with little to no dancing animation, it was hard to judge the caliber of the dancers. This just proves the anime, at a fundamental level, failed. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like dull leads, predictable plots, a cluster of shounen tropes, and long-winded dialogues about how good/bad someone is dancing, go for it. Otherwise, you aren't missing anything.",

            "content": "Coming from Production IG who's track record we are all aware of, Ballroom e Youkoso is certainly a star in this packed summer 2017 season. \r\nThis run of sport and athletic anime being produced is really a joy for me to see. The diversity and vast approach all of them are taking and the care they are putting into portraying these different sports, it's something wonderful to see. Ballroom e Youkoso is a part of this wondrous run. \r\nAs far as the story goes, I am a little disappointed with regards to the setup. Fujita being a complete novice but yet holding some miraculous abilitythat goes beyond reason, Hyodou being an absolute beast on the floor. This is something we have seen time and again, but the show is charming enough to compensate for this well trodden road. The addition of Hanaoka, who is talented in her own right, as Hyodou's partner and the focus of Fujita's fancies, and then Sengoku, former superstar who is now a teacher, it feels a bit like a mashup in ideas between Haikyuu and Yuri on Ice. They all work well together, especially considering the fact that the anime is about dance. \\n\\n\r\nFujita's arc so far has been enjoyable, watching him and his growing desire to compete is quite admirable. His growth as a dancer is almost laughable but then there are moments where his internal brilliance shines through and you get caught off guard, just like the characters in the show. \\n\r\nI also appreciate that even though Fujita is the MC, the other pairs and members of the dance studio play such an integral part in his development. They aren't exactly a team but function as some sort of strange family with rivalries and desires to get better. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the show really sends it to the top in my honest opinion. The art exaggerates the postures and figures of everyone in the show, which makes the dancing feel that much more real. In real life, dancers are meant to be larger than life and this show captures that well. Everyone appears long, everything flows, it's all extremely dynamic, the steps are crisp and precise, the emotion shines through each movement. It really is a great example of how to animate an activity with such a range in movements, from little swings of the hip and sliding of the feet to leaps and quick steps in succession. \\n\\n\r\nAs the season progresses, I am eager to see more of the dancing, how it evolves and how all the students can overcome their own personal dilemmas through their dance of choice.",

            "content": "Ballroom e Youkoso (Welcome to the Ballroom) is an open love letter to those struggling with ambition, goals and dreams. While primarily an anime about the sport of competitive Ballroom dancing and everything that comes with it, the point of this series is that it\u2019s never too late to do what you\u2019re passionate about and that you should never let anything\u2014whether it be age or other people\u2019s opinions, stop you. You learn this message through the characters journey and a rhetorical question that is brought to focus, many times along the way, \u201cWhy do you dance?\u201d.\r\nBased on Tomo Takeuchi\u2019s manga, Welcome to the Ballroom revolvesaround a young boy who has no passions and no idea what he wants to pursue in life in Tatara Fujita\u2014while that may sound corny to some, it is a very real-world problem that most of us have gone through. Life hasn\u2019t been kind to our protagonist, he was a victim of bullying in middle school, his parents are divorced, his teacher had little hopes for him and that he didn\u2019t have any prospects for high school. One day, on a whim, he followed his beautiful classmate Shizuku Hanaoka home, which brought him to the Ogasawara Dance Studio, headed by none other than the champion ballroom dancer Kaname Sengoku. After becoming captivated by watching Shizuku and Sengoku\u2019s performances, an ember of flames emits within Tatara, he has discovered something that not only he has the natural talent for but also a new found love in dancing, something he learns and pickups quickly and becoming more passionate about it. This sets the stage for a \u201cCinderella\u201d type of story, not only in his new-found passion and aiming for the pros but also as a person with many flaws\u2014the transformation he goes through is nothing short of inspiring.\\n\\n\r\nBallroom puts the focus exclusively on a few select characters, rather than a whole cast of characters, and I think this allows each character to have their fair share of the spotlight, it actually treats its characters like people with fleshed out personalities. Rivals and new characters were introduced gradually into the series with each arc, giving us time to get to know each character and get comfortable with them before new characters are presented. Indeed, the story is centred around Tatara\u2019s perspective and his growth, but ample time is given for the other characters to shine as well. The diverse mix of personalities in the series keeps it interesting\u2014the powerful and charismatic Sengoku, the dark and mysterious Masami Kugimiya, the talented and hardworking Kiyoharu Hyoudou, the determined and elegant Shizuku, the cute and humble Mako Akagi, and the bossy but skilled Chinatsu Hiyama. Chinatsu becomes one of the most intriguing characters in the series. It\u2019s always nice to see strong female personalities in anime, and Chinatsu\u2019s fiery disposition truly depicts that. The clashing dynamics between Tatara and Chinatsu, whose personalities are the complete opposite of the other is very interesting, there is a special chemistry between the two where despite the clashing and conflicts, they complete each other.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Tatara and Chinatsu are on the floor, they aren\u2019t always in sync, but they are always moving. One pushes, another yield's. Then the roles are reversed. Back and forth, back and forth. They\u2019re not fighting. Their energies are harmonized\u2014towards the mutual goal of a seamless performance, eventually, they're perfectly balanced against one another. Even in instances where the pair is fighting\u2014whether it be subtextual, verbally, or physically, the balance remains. They are evenly matched. Each gives as good as he or she gets\u2014and there is inevitably a certain measure of respect, one for the other\u2019s skill. They spar almost from the moment they meet. Their arguments are earnest, but their energy is always aligned, the chemistry between them is the best thing this series has going for it. This is the result of putting two lively characters together where they create a dance of opposition and harmony, having a focus on dynamic character archetype, enacting change and finally creating coherent conflict. Unfortunately, the execution isn\u2019t always on point for some parts, this can be very frustrating but it gets it right towards the end. Tatara\u2019s circumstances are also something viewers might be able to relate to, as a newbie, Tatara gets the feeling that he\u2019s \u201carrived late\u201d and that he\u2019s in a hurry to catch up with the others. At some point, we have all found a new passion or hobby that we wished we had started before, hence fearing that we\u2019re not as good as we could have been, or that we might have missed out on many things. The message here as mentioned earlier is that it\u2019s never too late.\\n\\n\r\nIt is clear to see which studio was in charge of adapting Ballroom as you can see similarities visually to Haikyuu!! and Production I.G\u2019s work here is like a mixed bag of candies\u2014you get the bad with the good. The character designs, colour palette and background look very gorgeous in Production I.G signature fashion. But there are certain things like the exaggerated movements and facial expressions that can be off-putting at times, even entering \u2018memes\u2019 territory like the long necks and creepy faces. While it doesn\u2019t quite excel in the quantity of animating full-dancing sequences, but it does deliver in moments of pure beauty, like Mako\u2019s \u201cblooming\u201d performance. For the most part, its portrayal of the grace of a dancer\u2019s body well is something to appreciate, I particular like the detailing in the perspiration of the dancers, it\u2019s telling in how much effort and energy is put into a performance of Ballroom dancing and indicates to the audience, the physical and emotional strains competitors have during competitions.\\n\\n\r\nBoth OP\u2019s by Unison Square Garden was very upbeat and did a superb job hyping up the atmosphere for the main course. The ED\u2019s by Mikako Komatsu was really sweet and very fitting to end each episode on. The first ending in particular, \u201cMaybe The Next Waltz\u201d left a deep impression on me when I first heard it. Incorporating instruments like the violin and the bass and paired with just the right art scenes, it gave a sort of classical and sincere vibe that is rarely heard in today\u2019s music. The voice acting is one of Ballroom\u2019s strengths, the voices complemented the characters\u2019 personalities well, and that goes for the entire main cast and supporting roles. I especially liked Sengoku and Chinatsu\u2019s voice actors in, Toshiyuki Morikawa and Chinatsu Akasaki. The actual soundtrack isn\u2019t particularly memorable in my opinion, but they match the scenes well and does their job, especially when it comes to the dancing segments.\\n\\n\r\nBallroom is certainly not a perfect show, it has some issues that need to be brought to light\u2014the pacing, the duration on certain conflicts, visuals and animation in dancing segments, and the tone, but they weren\u2019t consistent issues to the point of being unbearable. And this is what stops the series from being one of the greats of recent memory. This was something the final episode did brilliantly, it shows us why Tatara dances. I believe, on some level, everyone wants, and deserves to be able to shout \u201cLook at me!\u201d to the world. Even shy people yearn to be the centre of attention sometimes, especially for something they\u2019re successful at. Personally, this is the visceral draw of competitive dance\u2014it\u2019s a sport, performance art and an explosion of personal expression all rolled into one. Remember, it never too late to do what you want in life. Discovering passions late shouldn\u2019t discourage you from not fully committing yourself and reaching newly found goals. You can shape your life the way you want it.\\n",

            "content": "Sports shows sometimes are very hard to handle especially on the art and animation category. Some studio really pushed their limits just to achieve and match the sports for the sake of the overall production of the series. But don't you worry, Production I.G is back to save the day! before I conclude my review, let me discuss the show's fine points and noticeable flaws \r\nThis really bothers me when I watched the very first episode. The similarities  between this show and Hajime no Ippo's pilot episode is insane. This is definitely interesting or rather annoying for other people but for me atleast, Istill quite enjoy the 1st episode even though the execution isn't original. The overall plot is quite decent, I think the show doesn't really bother saving all of its full potential rather than making a risk and just blows everything up just to impress us the audience very early in the series. The show really excels on the general build up, giving us major informations that helps us to enjoy and understand the series. Though not all of them are given, there are times that you can't understand some of its given basic rules or even major guidelines for the competitions. Also I find the characters quite appealing, tho they're still not that very well fleshed out. But overall the show still really is trying hard to give us knowledge to understand the show fully. Btw, you know that one series that blew all of its animation budget for episode 1? and then as the show goes on, the quality melted? Ballroom e Youkoso wants to avoid that. ( \"Yes we were born to make history!\"~ ) \\n\\n\r\nI won't say much on the art because that's Production I.G for you. Stellar visuals, very detailed character designs, clean frames and great cinematography. I love the style and the details for the series but there is that one major problem that the series really can't avoid even for bigger studios like Production I.G, the lack of time for animating complicated performances. That's ballroom for you, very good to look at when it's animated perfectly but very hard to animate and it takes so much time. For now, I've seen some dancing scenes that felt too short, for the most part it's just editing and a detailed keyframe. I'll definitely accept Production I.G rotoscoping real ballroom sequences rather than having them waste time on animating these from scratch. ( Tho, it is confirmed that I.G really don't rotoscope real movements, they're more likely to use them as reference.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ballroom e Youkoso is a good show, having such fascinating visuals and with an interesting premise really deserves to be one of the highlights of this season. But let's still wait and see if this show really deserves the praise. Do I recommend you to watch it? Definitely! Is it for everyone, probably. \\n\\n",

MC is a crybaby, no special born-gifted talent, no hardworking, screws up most of the time and is hard to understand. But other characters are logical reasonable and filled with awesomeness. Like Sengoku, like Kurusomething, like Sengoku partner, like Mako, like Gaju. But others i dont know they dont fit to those characters and art and music. \u0130ts like they are gathered from other shows. This is actually why i dont like this show that much. \u0130 watchedit to see if anything catches me but i will leave it at 16th episode and if i see a score jump after this show is finished then i will start from where i leff.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Art is little brother of Haikyu, and story is not everywhere Haikyu. \u0130ts not about dance, i think its about when you present dancing with this art,music and great characters it makes dance look like an lady in his 50s tring to race with Usain Bolt or tring to block DeAndre Jordan.\\n\\n\r\n\u0130 think thats all what i think about this show but hey i think its bad, its not horrible, if possible id like to give it 5,75 points. Oh well i didnt have that option. But i can say this is show is not best of summer 2017, anime doesnt have endless potential like a living human being can have and this anime is at least something you can spend your time if you are free. Lastly as a old sportsman i will leave this here, Sports are not good looking aesthetic part of art. From what i got while watching this anime is Dancing in general is best when it does look good not when you run like you are escaping from Godzilla or its not like you are shooting a beam to enemy tower. \u0130ts like \" Yeeey we look so nice and artistic.\" No. Sorry to all dancers but im not gonna accept dancing as a sports even if its in Olympics or whatever. This is why i didnt like story at all, it is presented wrong in my opinion, even on worldwide where all people accepts it. Would be better if this was just a Netorare hentai or a Romantic Drama like Scum's Wish which is the show i hate most.",

A masterpiece!\r\nWelcome to the Ballroom is one of the candidates for anime of the year. At first i was wondering what an anime about social dancing could offer to me as a viewer who has no particular interest in these stuff. I got myself into a fantastic show who knows how to built up the tension in each episode and release it on the dance floor, in a beautiful display of the characters thoughts and feelings during their dance and finally i got someknowledge  about the dancing world. Let's not forget the enjoyment after finishing each episode that leaft a great taste in my mouth. If you are hesistant to watch it because of that trust me it's worth your time and it will exceed your expectations. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is layered in two acts and follows the development of our main character Tatara as he venture into the world of dancing.  He discovers and experience new stuff and emotions that break his ordinary world and make him step up his game. The focus is not only on Tatara, the story has more  to offer  such as competitions, rivals, different styles and genres of dancing(quickstep, waltz ) ,the effort and time spend on mastering your own style as a dancer, what it needs for a dancing pair/couple to work as one, leader/follower in a pair  and finally how all these things influence the lives of the characters as dancers. Amazing!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great and the funny interactions between them manages to make them easier to be understood by the viewers. They develop and shine on the dance floor were each dance gives you a bump of adrenaline. What it's impressive in this anime is how they manage to connect its audience to the mindset, emotions and tensed atmosphere that our characters feel on the dance floor. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals and great music play an important role throughout this series and manage to make an ordinary dance from boring to brilliant  and make the dancers bloom like a beautiful flower on the dance floor.\\n\r\nIf i may complain of something about this show that would be the first episodes who are kinda slow but even this can't ruin my overall enjoyment and impression. Just watch it is damn awesome!",

The animation is great and seeing all the work that was put into this anime is amazing. I appreciate the crews hard work and the creator for making this. The characters are unique and sometimes you can get lost with what their goals are but that could just be lost in whether or not you're paying attention to the subtitles and show or just watching the images itself. The maincharacter is relatable and offers so much potential to this anime. I am up to date with the manga and since this anime's release I have been excited to see it all animated and where it leads next. The music is nice and fits very well! I enjoy this anime because it keeps my attention and I can relate to it because who hasn't been like the main character at some point in their lives when they try something new and want to get better?",

It turns out our guy is a wimpy useless liberal left feminist douche! And the new girl is more manly with good bully future.

            "content": "May contain slight spoilers...\r\nFor an anime that\u2019s entire focus is dancing, I\u2019m a little disappointed in some of the dance scenes I found in Welcome to the Ballroom. Why, you may ask? Well, if I had to sum up my issues with the show, I\u2019d probably blame them on the show\u2019s budget. Of course, it wasn\u2019t all bad as I thoroughly enjoyed the characters that I met in this 2 cour anime, and the drama and comedy kept me watching for more, but I just couldn\u2019t shake the problems I kept picking up on.\r\nFirst of all, let\u2019s start with the good points. The characters areall lovely and most of them get their own special moment in the spotlight. We either watch them dance their hearts out or peer into their backstories that are filled with all the hardships that they endured to become the athletes they are today. Their interactions with each other are also hilarious, as dancers competing in their pairs are forced to try and somewhat get along, allowing some funny or gripping moments between the cast.\\n\\n\r\nEach of their differing personalities clashes with each other, from an enthusiastic newbie that learns differently from others, the professionals that practice endlessly to maintain their status and a female dancer that would rather act as the male lead role in the couple. The more you progress into the show, the more you learn about a certain someone as they continue to grow in experience and skill. Add in rivals and silly facial reactions and it becomes a joy to watch their antics as they either try to teach the new kid to dance the basics or look away when one of them is being subjected to some painful joint stretches. You can\u2019t help but have fun watching the cast training to perfect their dance routines or enjoying their lives as school students.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, these same elements are used to create drama as well, with a sibling couple separating cause they can\u2019t seem to reach their full potential together or an old-fashioned dancer trying to make a comeback after being out of the game for awhile. You can\u2019t be the best in anything if you don\u2019t overcome obstacles, and the show knows how to create situations for our characters so they can rise up to the challenge. The mix of laughter and tears accumulate into a story that just draws you into their world of professional ballroom dancing as they enter tournament after tournament to show off their style to everyone around them.\\n\\n\r\nNow the main issue I have with the show, the actual dancing. Due to it being an animated show locked under money constraints, it\u2019s forced to use way too many stills and transitions to try and make it\u2019s dancing scenes barely \u201cpassable\u201d. If may work for other anime to do something like this, but for a sport that solely relies on body movement to entertain its audience, a lot of the time there is not enough actual movement.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s even worse is all the dialogue that should just be going on in the background becomes the focus as the camera is forced from the characters dancing to someone in the audience commenting on what\u2019s happening. Instead of being an anime about dancing, it seems to turn into an anime about people talking about dancing a few too many times.\\n\\n\r\nThe music for some tournaments also needs to be improved, as there are a quite a few scenes where the songs in the first half don\u2019t exactly match the dancing. Dancing and music go hand in hand, so to mess up something as important as this, along with every other issue mentioned, it\u2019s gonna lower the enjoyment of the show quite significantly. It might be better to just read the manga where it\u2019s already still/quiet so you won't have to sit through the anime's problems or wait for a movie that has more time and cash to actually put in the effort needed to make the show look good.\\n\\n\r\nEven with the frequently lacklustre dance animation, Welcome to the Ballroom was still a joy to watch each week. The characters and story kept me from hating the show, keeping my score and view of the show decently high. Of course, there may be people that can\u2019t forgive an anime for being unable to properly portray its main focus, so some might see the manga as best option if you still wanna try the series. If I had to choose between calling this show a good or bad experience, I would have to say it was pretty good, so at least try it out for yourself. Anime or manga, whichever one you decide, just let yourself get dragged into their story.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nFor as long as I have known my older sister, she has been a dancer through and through.\r\nEverywhere has counted: at the school talent show, at her local studio, at numerous recitals, at different states. Everything has counted as well: tap, ballet, hip-hop, Latin. Across her entire leg-driven journey, she has claimed enough awards and cheers and experience to last a lifetime.\r\nBasically, she has seen and partaken in nearly all that dance has to offer. Despite her dancing expertise, though, I have yet to hear any mention of ballrooms. And after watching the entirety ofBallroom e Youkoso, I can confidently say, as someone with zero dance moves whatsoever, she is seriously missing out.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThe world of competitive ballroom dancing may not exactly be on the forefront of everyone\u2019s mind. It exists within that niche corner given its lack of truly intense traits and low popularity. It tends to also be a very difficult sport to get into, demanding countless hours of repeating the same basic techniques and requiring certain physical builds to succeed. And its set of unfair stigmas potentially turn people away from the get-go before they even give it a fair chance.\\n\\n\r\nBallroom e Youkoso faces such negativity head up and foot forward without ever losing a beat.\\n\\n\r\nTrue to its premise, the anime understandably makes it a priority to explain what goes on within ballroom dancing for the uninitiated (which, again, is most likely a majority). The dances themselves \u2013 the waltz, the quickstep, the tango \u2013 are paramount, so the differences, the nuances, and the moves between them become a focal point. Tons of smaller details about the league, the scoring, the ranks, the gender ratios, and the types also pop up to further flesh out the formation of the sport and thus the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is not just content with explaining itself; Ballroom e Youkoso also demonstrates what makes ballroom dancing worthwhile to begin with. It does so with a passionate edge, a look-see into the minds of the dancers themselves. In doing so, the show grants itself a cooler, fuller picture of its scenes beyond just watching a bunch of people twirl and step about.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance, ballroom dancing posits that mutual chemistry between two people causes a better understanding of one\u2019s self as adaptation and sympathy take hold. Moreover, it demonstrates a willingness and a purpose on behalf of the dancers, for they choose this sport not for direct confrontation but instead as a want and as a desire to prove their capabilities to the masses. And the sport simply brings fun and happiness as synchronized steps form rapturous emotion for the dancers, the judges, and the audience at large.\\n\\n\r\nLooking into Ballroom e Youkoso on a narrative level, it showcases a solid-enough plot as the practices, the tournaments, and the conflicts naturally arise. Furthermore, themes on self-worth and numerous engaging moments affix an appropriate amount of drama. It could be argued that the competitions tend to stretch out too long at times, but the intermittent hype of the dances and those introspective thoughts of the characters yield the right amount of variety to keep these stretches manageable.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does not earn full marks in every round, though. The occasional sexual content is not totally out of place when considering the sensuality of dancing itself and the attractive people who believe this sport to be their calling. Akira commenting on Chinatsu\u2019s extreme beauty or Chinatsu in turn teasing Akira for her extra curves do not cross over into weird territory.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the infrequent \u201cjokes\u201d related to accidents, sizes, and masculinity can cross the line, clashing too much with the seriousness of the drama and leaning too far outside of the lighthearted direction of the comedy overall.\\n\\n\r\nBesides this problem, some of the writing and the dialogue can come off as antiquated due to the terminology surrounding the male-and-female duos. But this awkwardness deals more so with the culture of the sport and treads into nitpicking territory since the ladies are themselves a powerful bunch anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the setup, the purpose, and the structure of the story allow positivity to reign supreme within this dancing spectacle.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOn the visual side, Ballroom e Youkoso continues its strong stride.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs start things off right. Nice line work and facial details in general increase the accuracy of their depictions and therefore give greater definition to their expressions. Their casual garb versus their competitive attire \u2013 especially for how much handsomer and prettier the men and women respectively jump \u2013 makes for a lovely contrast, too. Even their overly long necks (giraffes or no) contribute an elegance and a fragility which further emphasizes the impact of their dances.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the audience must suspend some disbelief that these near-pro-yet-still amateurs are at the tail-end of middle school despite looking like college kids or outright adults. Nevertheless, their slender frames once again bolster the ballroom motif, and their different builds even become a factor in the character writing itself.\\n\\n\r\nNot so right is Ballroom e Youkoso\u2019s penchant for reusing past moments or segments to a noticeable degree. Tatara\u2019s ginormous smile as he comes into frame comes to mind. While not a deal-breaker (since it is unrealistic to expect an absolute, constant upkeep of new depictions), it leaves the show for want of stronger artistic appeal.\\n\\n\r\nIt combats against this detriment with interspersed scenes filled with style and creativeness. Kiyoharu and Shizuku turn on fire at one point as their dancing heats up, and Tatara and Chinatsu break down doors together amidst their foggy consciousness. Whatever the case may be, these scenes up the intrigue and the fascination of the presentation, giving Ballroom e Youkoso another leg to stand on as its vital events commence.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime deserves some extra credit, too. Animating and articulating the complexities of dancers, both on their own and in unison, is by no means an easy feat. And, despite the troubles outlined above, the dancing depicted almost never took on any outright mistakes or notable hiccups. Rather, Ballroom e Youkoso took many a creative liberty with perspectives and proportions to up the ante.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the back bending could be slightly less obtuse, but this exaggeration furthers the finesse this sport demands. A praiseworthy stride no doubt.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWhile Ballroom e Youkoso does well on both a story and artistic front, the characters make a claim for the strongest part of the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nIt all centers on Tatara, the main protagonist of this dancing tale. Without much in the way of prospects, his humble beginnings make him a prime candidate for everlasting change. He has no experience whatsoever in this field, and he only joins the studio after watching the entrancing footage which Sengoku-san, the best ballroom dancer in the world, lent to him.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, Tatara\u2019s journey is far from an immediate rise to the top. He has sharp eyes that let him absorb information by studying those around him, and he has a keen knack for dance in general, but he begins at the bottom like any other jelly-legged nobody. Stamina issues, confidence issues. The anime makes it clear that Tatara is a bright young man with a good heart yet still needing all the help he can get.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s where the supporting cast members arrive. Ballroom dancing is a paired sport, so the people around Tatara offer their aid either directly or indirectly through mentoring, coaching, or battling. For instance, Shizuku will offer advice or encouragement from the sidelines, or Mako, with her own low self-esteem, will lean on him in her own time of need to challenge his perception.\\n\\n\r\nThen similarly, Tatara sees Sengoku-san and Kiyoharu as companions-in-arms (or rather legs) that inspire him. Sengoku-san represents his role model as he strives to be like him while also realizing how vastly inferior he is skill-wise. As for Kiyoharu, he wishes to compete alongside him someday soon, for they see in each other the same knack of passion and of potential.\\n\\n\r\nTruth be told, these side characters do not normally have the largest depth given the small amount of background exploration and the quickness of its delivery. But again, they exist mostly to compare and contrast with Tatara and show his strong points, his weak points, and everything in-between. Plus, Mako, Kiyoharu, and others still either receive their own time to shine or otherwise have portions of episodes dedicated to their past experiences and subsequent upbringing. That\u2019s more than enough for their supportive roles throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhat they and Tatara cannot fix, however, is his lacking foundation. In other words, Tatara\u2019s motivations and personal conflicts stem from a rather nonexistent place. His desire to change and to kickstart his static path is flimsy at best, and his background, home life, and general non-dance life is hardly (if ever) explored outright. So, while the path he takes develops him well, his core character never truly emerges.\\n\\n\r\nTo combat this problem, Ballroom e Youkoso doubles down on Tatara\u2019s character growth in the back half of the season. It does so not with its standard approach but instead by introducing into the fray a newcomer and, perhaps surprisingly, the second-most important person in the show: Chinatsu.\\n\\n\r\nChinatsu puts up a tough personality, dislikes dance, and maintains a lot of experience. Basically, she is the complete opposite of Tatara \u2013 naturally making her the perfect partner for him and him for her. They therefore don\u2019t quite get along (at first anyway), but they need each other more so than they realize. If for nothing else than to discover the \u201cother side\u201d of sorts.\\n\\n\r\nThese sides capture what they each fail to do. Tatara cannot lead; Chinatsu cannot follow. By mirroring their individual yet interlinked struggles in this manner, the show marks their bond as a stellar point of the series. They test and practice, fight and compromise. All in the name of leaving everything on the dance floor.\\n\\n\r\nAs this dichotomy plays out, he finally discovers the magic in his footing thanks to her uncompromising will, and she finally learns to trust others thanks to his unflinching determination. Thus, she goes from leading to following, and he goes from following to leading. Such a reversal in roles makes for an awesome dual character arc that they share together in splendid fashion.\\n\\n\r\nSimultaneously, more supporting characters arrive during this home stretch, too. Akira and her relationship with Chinatsu. Kugimiya and his internal frustrations. Once again, Ballroom e Youkoso enlists the help of these extras who both affect the mains in a worthwhile way and receive at least a modicum of attention to give their presence more than a passing stance.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of this two-cour season, Tatara, Chinatsu, and a host of other characters form a stalwart cast who not only contribute to the well-being of one another but also charge ahead with advancements of their own. They don\u2019t reach that top-tier spot, but strong execution in the writing can be seen readily enough.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of leading and following, Ballroom e Youkoso leads with several nice musical pieces and follows with some swell audio decisions as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe show kicks it off with its first opening track, \u201c10% roll, 10% romance\u201d. The rhythmic drums and the upbeat guitar build the foundation for this peppy song, and the lighter vocals form the mood equally as light. Better yet, the step-wise delivery and the multitude of pacing switch-ups coincide with that all-encompassing dancing motif, placing this OP into good graces.\\n\\n\r\nCome the second half of the anime, the second opening track, \u201cInvisible Sensation\u201d, replaces the first one. While it returns with a similar sense of instrumentation and singing, this new OP takes on a slightly different tone. A twinge of both passion and melancholy now exist in the composition as the hopeful arrangement carries on. While this track is somewhat of a downgrade, the nuanced shift in the overall feeling, to reflect the remainder of the season upon its arrival, can at least be appreciated.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cMaybe the next waltz\u201d isn\u2019t a statement but instead the title of the first ending track. Compared to its two OP counterparts, this piece invites the listener with gentleness aplenty. Piano keys and string instruments provide an orchestral base for a grander sound, but the chimes and general daintiness keep the song in check as its fantastical aura moves about softly on the ears. The main vocals dance along, the backing vocals uplift the track, and, in unison, they round out the rest of this unassuming melody.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the second ED, \u201cSwing heart direction\u201d combines a bit of each of the three songs heard already while carving out its own piece of the dance pie. Drums and guitar accompany a piano, working together and on their own, towards a sincere yet mellow angle. It doesn\u2019t quite dazzle as much as the other tracks, but its simplicity and (as it denotes) heart fill the song with a steady amount of emotion.\\n\\n\r\nBallroom e Youkoso also creates a bunch of sweet pieces for its original soundtrack in-between these OPs and these EDs. Dramatic tunes of violins and of pianos add the necessary weight to the more powerful moments, such as when Shizuku talks to Tatara about how he (and others) have already left an impression on her. A defined acoustic-guitar gets at a tensioned, almost sexy atmosphere when required. And hip-hop beats with a nearby saxophone push scenes along with a smooth, jazzy hand.\\n\\n\r\nThis diverse and intriguing OST is perhaps the best trait from the music-and-sound department, but the remaining elements deserve at least a shout-out, too. The anime demonstrates attention to detail with the squeaking of shoes on wooden flooring and, while the voice acting may not exactly enrapture, the ensemble cast provide very solid performances.\\n\\n\r\nAt the minimum, Chinatsu Akasaki as (coincidentally enough) Chinatsu displays a directness and a range of emotion that elevates the red-head above her peers. Alongside the strength of the audio direction overall, Ballroom e Youkoso caps off its production values with a lot of clout, indeed.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nSlap on me a bowtie and nickname me \u201cTango\u201d because I was a fan of this anime the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nThe gentlemen brought a lot. Tatara is an earnest fellow, and I like seeing him face his position with realism and guts. Gaju is at first a jerk, but he turns into a cool friend. And Kiyoharu is the quiet star, yet his wisdom and advice are honest and true. Each of the main ladies were a treat, too. Shizuku\u2019s alluring, thoughtful intimidation. Mako\u2019s tiny, cute smile. Chinatsu\u2019s tomboyish, fiery passion.\\n\\n\r\nThese characters are a ton of fun, and their rivalries and interactions translated into entertainment galore. I found myself rooting for and cheering on Tatara and Mako as their combined efforts led them to sincere happiness, and I invested emotions into Tatara and Chinatsu as they fought with everything they had.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, as someone without much interest in ballroom dancing, it kept me hooked. This sport is not technically a marvel, and I\u2019m certainly no expert in that field. Meaning, I\u2019m aware of its existence but I place myself in that group I described way earlier who truthfully cannot say it has landed on my radar in the past. Yet I\u2019m always open to trying out stories or premises that don\u2019t automatically fall into my favorite categories, and so I was pleasantly surprised that it basically never lost its luster and kept me engaged throughout its whole run.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I cannot forget to mention the other likable parts of this anime. The blonde Russian bombshell Marisa and the attractive Chizuru. The slight sparks of romance. The hilarious comedic segments throughout. Even if these parts weren\u2019t here within this anime, I would still be singing its praises \u2013 or, more relevantly, attempting a jig in its honor.\\n\\n\r\nBallroom e Youkoso impresses the judges and wows the onlookers with its moves. The audiovisual elements grab some attention, but the worthwhile setup, the strong character writing, and the huge amount of entertainment glide this project towards the front of the line. While not going everywhere or doing everything, it wins out regardless.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, ballroom dancing takes center stage, delivering a stout introduction to the sport and the benefits it brings, while also putting together a solid, exciting plot despite the occasional tactless \u201cjoke\u201d\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, wonderful designs, intriguing stylistic moments, and, for the complex dance numbers, both an avoidance of major mistakes and lots of creative liberties overcome some of the issues with reused segments\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, despite the weak motivations backing the core of Tatara\u2019s person, his growth throughout the season is reasonable and meaningful, his pairing with Chinatsu is stellar, and side cast members such as Mako and Kugimiya both support and improve\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Good, a collection of interesting OPs and EDs, a diverse OST, and some solid VA performances put the audio on the correct footing\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, waltzed right in and quickly became fun as it tangoed without end\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "\"Now that's what I call Sports Anime!\"  \r\nI cannot emphasize enough how wonderful this show was for me to watch. Until this past year I had not managed to enter the world of sports anime, and after devoting an entire season to exploring the genre in its various forms and series, I can definitively say that Ballroom e Youkoso (Welcome to the Ballroom) is one of my favorites and one of the most enjoyable by far. From basketball to rugby, ping pong to bicycle races, the realm of sports has all different kinds of appeal, however; Ballroom has something that is entirely unique toit: aesthetic. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I say this, I don't mean the art or animation--though I shall talk about that shortly. What I mean when I say aesthetic, is that the look of the competitors and exhibition of the dancing itself  is wholly important to the nature of the sport being examined here. Ballroom Dancing is a team (pair) sport about performing amazing physical feats and looking stunning while doing them with the utmost precision and technique. Though skeptical at first, I feel that this manga and subsequent anime adaption have done every thing in their power to show this to their audience. Though usually thought of as a activity for \"women, and old people with too much money and time on their hands,\" Ballroom manages to take every part of what makes an anime a \"sports\" anime and turn it into a show of beauty that appeals to a much wider audience than one may first think. \\n\\n\r\nAllow me to be the first to bring up last year's Yuri!!! On Ice, which disappoints severely in this regard. As a result of this past disappointment, I had a great deal misgivings about Ballroom and was worried that it would end on a less impressive note; however, after finding the manga at my local bookstore and deciding to pick it up and give it a perusal before the anime began, my fears were wiped away. What I got was beautiful illustrations, even development for the characters, and a story that didn't understate the work and effort and devotion they needed to be competitive dancers. Ballroom Dancing is a sport, this series wasn't going to let you forget that, and I love it all the more because of it.\\n\\n\r\nI have few points to bring up on the technical side of the series: \\n\\n\r\nStory: It's a tale as old as sports series about a boy who just wants something to give his life a little more meaning, finds his way into a dance school accidentally, and then finds himself exploring the world of a sport that he wouldn't have given a second glance at if not for the people he meets there. Now this is just how the story starts and as our leading boy Tatara explores the world of dance and struggles to find his dance we are treated to an interesting take on the typical beginner's story. Maybe nothing too flashy, but definitely nothing to sneeze at either.\\n\\n\r\nArt: People complain about the necks a lot, but this is dance and posture is consistently pointed out, so this is no doubt a creative choice on the part of the creators. The animation is lack luster at it's worst, and ASTOUNDING at it's best. While it would have been nice to have seen the animation be its best the entire time, very few seasonal anime manage to be as consistent, so some lee-way is there. Perfect? No, in fact it has a habit of letting you down too early in some crucial instances, but I believe it serves it's purpose more than well enough. You can follow the movements of the dancers almost always fluidly and that has to count for something.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: A++ Points for Unison Square Garden for both openings and Sing Sing Sing as part of the soundtrack. I don't think anyone would complain about the sound. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I found them to be unique and likeable. None of them were one-time friends or adversaries, and each of them had a story to tell and a role to play that would have changed the story entirely had they not been present. Some might find the protagonist a bit hard to be initially invested in, but time makes him grow on you, and until then the supporting cast is always fun. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Welcome to the Ballroom is an exemplary show that incorporates the beauty of ballroom dancing with the intensity of sports anime while balancing a well-put-together cast and enjoyable story. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is a very easy 24 episodes to recommend. I look forward to continuing to follow the manga and will be overjoyed should we ever get the honor of a future season of the anime.",

            "content": "So, personally, I was quite excited to start on this show and it really comprehended my excitement in the first two episodes. After this though, I became a little disappointed in the executing of the show and found myself missing some elements, which I think of as necessary in a show about ballroom dancing. Of course, some of these elements are clearly my personal taste and they do not make the show less entertaining. I will praise that the studio did an amazing job nonetheless, but maybe my expectations were just too high.\r\nThe second half of the show was way better than the first, introducingsome new characters, which helped the main character along with his development. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are decent enough to be enjoyable. The main character can come across as whiny and a coward, but that\u2019s just the way he is and he is eventually developing those weaknesses into strong points. \\n\r\nIn the second half, you have Chinatsu who helps him with learning more about himself. I really liked her character. She has a nasty personality, but I really enjoy characters who stir some life into the cast. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, the art and animation look amazing as expected of this studio. The thing what I was most displeased by was the number of dancing animations or the lack of. Especially in the first half, they show little to no dancing, while this is a show about ballroom dancing. The second half makes it a little better, but the amount of still frames is still quite a lot. I don\u2019t hate the still frames, but I don\u2019t want them to take over.\\n\r\nI really missed seeing all the choreographic of the dances. Of course, I don\u2019t expect them to show us all the dances of all the competitors since they\u2019re a lot of them. But I wish they would show some complete dances to really show of the beauty of ballroom dancing. \\n\\n\r\nFor me there were only the main characters; it was like the other people didn\u2019t even exist, even though they were competing in the same competition. I would have loved to see more dances of different couples to show us more of how high the level is for the main characters to dance to. I completely missed the rivalry feeling in the first half. \\n\r\nThe second half did it a little better by introducing us to a few more couples, but still, it wasn\u2019t enough for me. \\n\r\nI know it would be a lot of work to make more characters and show their dances as well, so this is a personal touch I would have just loved to see. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that bothered me a bit was the little explanation of the sport itself. To me, it felt like there wasn\u2019t really any explanation on the dances itself or how the steps really are. Maybe a little information on the music would have been nice as well. \\n\r\nShowing us a little more of the choreographic and how the dances really work would have made me enjoy the show more as I would have had a better understanding of it all.\\n\r\nAlso, a noticeable thing would be that it isn\u2019t really explained what the judges look for in a dance. The show makes it same as the judges just look for their personal preference, which would make them bias as hell. \\n\\n\r\nSo, these things are personal, but I believe if they included some of my points here then the show would have become a much more enjoyable watch than before. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, I still enjoyed this show to a certain extent. \\n\\n\r\nSo, as a recommendation, I would say, only if you really like your sports anime. Other than that, don\u2019t come like me for the ballroom dancing and the technical side of it, since that isn\u2019t really in this show. \\n",

            "content": "This review contains mild spoilers.\r\nI just finished it and I felt the urge to write a review.\r\nNot feeling like doing an aspect-on-aspect one tho, I just wanna let my emotions flow, so, oh boy, was this a compelling series, at the start, little did I know that it would grow this much on me, I even thought of it as an Ippo rip-off, not because of nothing, the start of both series is pretty much identical, Tatara is a bullied, shy guy with nothing quite remarkeable in his school life, saved and inspired by a pro-sportsman and introduced to his practice in a way thatmakes him think about becoming someone with it, the same as Ippo did, looking up to a contemporary too.\\n\\n\r\nBut then the series started progressing, and quietly started to demolish my expectations of it, the character dynamics, facilitated by the sport, became something absolutely important, and while Tatara was still a weak person, you could start to see his progress as his new experiences guided him, and that his relationship with the characters appearing, specially Mako, were something that the show took a big time in evolving and letting the viewer get what each of them felt in every step they took. It was fascinating to see all those eyes put in this totally incomplete person, but for all the wrong reasons! The series doesn't have problem acknowledging how bad Tatara is, and that's what made his development something so special, he doesn't get better by himself, but by this character dynamics I talked about before. You can understand, by the things he passes through (and not in some intense training animation sequences), the way he goes building his dancer life, and that works pretty well with what Hyodo says about Tatara being someone who dances through his emotions; the people in his life construct him, and it was kinda beautiful to watch, not magical improvement here. \\n\\n\r\nBut hey, that was the first half, and it was good, but while the characters keep being so important, the second half is superior in all ways, giving Tatara a partner was something necessary, but giving him such a partner, such a human being was a perfect move by the writers, we as an audience get to know Tatara defied by something so different to everything else he has handled, and even if he keeps being that humble guy, his dynamics with Chinatsu are complex and well explored. That theme became the main plot point of the second half, and god was it resolved, the climax reached in episode 23 was absolutely satisfying, watching them finally become a couple after all that character study in the previous episodes made me feel rewarded and hit me hard, I was foolish at comparing it to Hajime no Ippo, the relationships here evolved in a way the individual sport of boxing cannot characterize, and well, I should stop comparing since both shows went in opposite ways, so hell, the way they embraced their feelings and finally accepted their differences and problems felt absolutely as their completion of their way to the start line, and it gives proper conclusion, but also a new start to hope something big.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is consistent, the exposition made in the dances may put some people off, but I think the way they did it made them achieve their objective of getting to know their characters at all their faces.\\n\\n\r\nNot saying this is a perfect piece of media though, the dances don't feel like dances most of the time, and the animation does its job greatly just like 4 times in the whole series, there are some horrible cgi models that appear in every damn dance, and sometimes the sound, while beautiful, isn't put in the most desirable way, given the possibility of using that many genres and styles, I hoped they gave the music some big importance, but they didn't, it just affects the way the dance must go, and sometimes they'll put their background music over dances that don't have anything to do with it. Apart from that, those 4 scenes were spectacular, and the background music is cute and the Openings and Endings are all great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, sure it is somewhat flawed as any audiovisual composition, but it is incredibly fulfilling, and incredibly great at the things it knows how to do.\\n\r\nLoveable AF.",

The part i most loved is prolly the slow paced ch. development: weather it is tad of romance, skills,ability, trusting each other,believing,recovery and the spirit.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, i hope there's gonna be a S2 for the season's best rom/sports animu :)",

            "content": "Honestly, this show was more like a 7 for me but the last episode really brought it up to an 8.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe storyline was okay-- it followed the manga (even went a bit over) but at least it ended on a good note. I liked how the studio managed to end it where I was on the edge of my seat wanting to have some more content but at the same time be satisfied with what they've animated. It's one of those endings that made me want to see more but also feel like it's a good way to end the show.\r\nArt 8/10\r\nArt-wise, I think7 would have been suitable number for it but the animation in the last episode reall bumped it up to an 8. I didn't like how the studio made the characters skinnier than what they looked like in the manga because it really took away from the sexy-vibe the character had going on when they danced. The line work in the characters seemed kind of awkward and weird at some points but overall, it was okay.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound is definitely an 8. The voice actors did a great job with showing the emotions of the characters through their voice and it fit the characters really well. The music choices in the dances really fit the show as well. I'm not sure how to grade sound quality because that can change depending on where you watch it but the overall sound was great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nLooking at this through a character development point of view, then the characters have really developed from the start of the show to the end. Fujita's development is probably the best going from the newbie who didn't know anything about dance to the carefree, expressive rookie. I gave this category a 7 looking at the character's personality and compatibility with other characters and I'd say that this number fits it well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI would've given the enjoyment a 7 but as I typed before, the last episode really boosted it up by one point. I've read the manga and I know what happened (at least before the last episode) and I really enjoyed the manga so I had high expectations for the show as well-- the show met my requirements and really gave me a hype when something was about to come up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI'm saying this again but since I've read the manga, it would've been a 7 but the last episode really bought me and brought it up to an 8.",

            "content": "Hajime Shokugeki no Kuroko's Ballroom e Ippo no Haikyuu could've been a much more enjoyable anime if not for two major character mistakes:  \r\n1. They all but removed Sengoku from the series in the second season.\r\n2. They introduced Chinatsu who I did not like at all.  \r\nSengoku was by far the best character in the entire anime, yet, without spoiling things, they completely removed his character for half of the anime.  He was the source of the humor and energy for the entire anime, and they cut him out.  Big mistake.  \r\nBut the biggest mistake was the introduction of Chinatsu,who, for me, was a supremely unlikeable character, on the order of Sakura from Naruto.  Needlessly moody, obstinate and not at all charming as a Tsundere.  (SLIGHT SPOILER) And it was doubly irritating considering that the clear move and best pairing for Tatara was Mako.  I shipped Mako and Tatara hard, but instead, we get this irritating woman coming out of nowhere. \\n\\n\r\nThis really killed the anime for me.  I really just lost interest and only completed it now because I had a couple of episodes left and I figured: \"Meh, why not finish it?\".  \\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell from my intro, this anime is just another Shoukugeki No Soma, Kuroko No Basket, Hajime No Ippo or Haikyuu.  Instead of sports or food, it's ballroom dancing, which was a weird choice.  But, it's exactly the same in that a savant takes on a competitive field of individuals and overcomes the odds, while people in the stands pretty much narrate the story for you.  Nothing groundbreaking or original in terms of plot. \\n\\n\r\nI will say the animation was striking for its unusual style.  Although, the dance moves weren't that well animated, in my opinion.  It was more just zooming in on character's over exaggerated faces while the background moved behind them. Or they would be frozen in place while the camera panned their bodies.  The actual movements weren't very well animated.  I give them a break on it, however, because animating dancing seems to be hard for everyone to do.  I think that's why there aren't more anime revolving around dancing.  But, besides that, the character design was interesting, especially the ostrich necks.    \\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I really liked the anime's first season when the goal seemed to be catching up to Kiyoharu and Shizuku, Sengoku was the Sensei and Mako was the partner.  But, once that all changed in the second season, and become more about Tatara learning how to deal with a irritant like Chinatsu, the anime lost its magic.  \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: 5",

            "content": "Ballroom e Youkoso is what I would call a hidden gem, the genre itself is both intriguing and at the same time not interesting for many. One of the reason why people started watching in the first place was they bump into it expecting it to be similar to current Sports Anime or because Production I.G. is the one producing the anime and Haikyuu! is definitely a hit. But I can definitely say this is far different from Haikyuu! and wont satisfy everyone.\r\nLets start with a quick introduction, I also joined competitive ballroom dancing before and Ballroom e Youkoso portrays a good amount of whatyou would expect in Competitive ballroom dancing. I can say for a certain that what the anime and the manga tackles is the environment of competitive ballroom dancing itself and not only our main character and his growths and struggles.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9.5/10\\n\r\nThe pacing of Ballroom e Youkoso is quite slow especially at the latter half of the story. But it showcase how hard it is to dance and the struggles both Tatara and Chinatsu is very realistic. Unity is something many dancers achieve and it can only happen when you build a good relationship and practice with your partner. And i think MC and FMC felt like real dancers with struggles and issues. Also props to Tomo-sensei for portraying a realistic environment. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nLike many fans, i was expecting a very fluid movement and not CGI (similar to Haikyuu!) but the anime's budget is low and it is to be expected since the manga itself was not that popular for its not so common genre. Besides the lack of fluid movements, it could have shown even little movements to teach viewers of basics and such but it is rarely found in the anime. But the character design is what set a good tone to the anime and also the beautiful setting. The imagery use in the anime is impressive, whenever Hyoudo describes a particular scene you can also imagine what they are describing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.5/10\\n\r\nPersonally I like many of the score and music use in the anime, it never seem to be too much and fits most of the scene quite well. I also have few favorites in the disc so feel free to support the anime by buying the disc. I think its worth it and many feels powerful and impactful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.5/10\\n\r\nEach character is unique and has its own flavor. All of them are drawn and animated beautifully and its quite amazing. The guys usually have humor while the girls are the ones who are usually elegant well besides Chinatsu and Akira. What others find boring in the character backstory is what I usually enjoy. All of the characters have good background story and I personally feel connection with all the dancers, especially Kugimiya Masami. I wont spoil but unlike many regular sports, competitive dancing is usually based from judge's preferences. Whether they like your style of dancing or not will depend to them. So you can expect many frustrations from dancers who dance particular styles but never won not because they are dancing bad but because someones dance has more impact. For someone who dance for a living, it is hard to be herald as always in the finals but never winning. Not to say that Kugimiya-kun could have change things differently but it is frustrating at times. So I could certainly say many of the characters in Ballroom e Youkoso are similar to modern day ballroom dancers. Both glory and frustration is showcase and I personally admire Tomo-sensei for that. Also Tatara is indeed OP, he is a gifted dancer but IRL you wont see many person with that talent to easily copy variations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed it a lot, especially the first 5 ep and Chinatsu x Tatara arc. I am similar to him because I am close friends with my partner so we also fight a lot. The transition from dancing on your own vs suddenly having a partner is something many new dancers will find struggle with. As a lead you are still inexperience leading so technically you will have difficulty while as a follower you wont blindly trust your lead first few times because you are not comfortable with them yet. Basically you build the relationship from ground up regardless how talented both you are. And it is showcase in Tatara and Chinatsu. So yes I enjoyed the show a lot but does not mean i dont have issues with some of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nRegardless if you are interested in Dancing or not, i think ballroom e youkoso showcase a lot of things. You could also add a slice of life in the genre though it is very subtle. Anyone who likes anime that devotes on a passion or hobby will definitely like this anime. The realistic approach is something I personally like so even though it is quite slow at times, simply watch and finish it before saying its boring,etc. A must watch.",

            "content": "I remember after my complete re-watch of Haikyuu in the summer of 2017 I really was in the mood for something current that was either an Action or Sport genre type. After browsing the Summer 2017 lineup I decided to go with Ballroom e Yokoso.\r\nIt had already been six or eight episodes in and to be honest I didn't really have high hopes for it because of the \"Sport\" of choice. Glad to say, it turned out more than just decent.\r\nIt did start off kind of slow for me and the accent on characters eyelashes was a little awkward for me. It was the firsttime I saw something like it in Anime. It didn't take very long for me to look past the accented eyelashes though and shortly after that around episode 10 I think I noticed myself really wanting to see more and being annoyed that I had to wait the week. Totally unexpected turn of events...\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say the next 3 months or so was the all to well known \"high/low\" feel when its your shows day of the week/when the ending credits play. I decided to re-watch it recently and it was much nicer without the down time in between lemme tell ya.\\n\\n\r\nIt does have some typical Shounen elements that you'd come to expect which could put a damper on the show for some people but for me I think they did well with it and kept the main focus on the Sport aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI think the character cast was pretty solid all around. There might have been a little to much rivalry going on all over the place for some but I think there was enough differences in personalities around the Anime to make everything flow okay. Through it all we get to see some growth in a few people, not just Tatara.\\n\\n\r\nIf you told me over ten years ago that I'd eventually sit through and highly enjoy a Sport Anime about Dance I'd have probably thought you were crazy. Not because I dislike dance though. It would have just been to far-fetched for me to believe there would even be an Anime centered around the topic. I say now that I'm glad I happened to watch this one and anyone looking to try something outside the box, please do, you might end up like me and be pleasantly surprised at the end of it all.",

            "content": "\u201cLook. Look. Look at me!\u201d\r\nThere are times when we want others to notice us. To praise us. Accept us. We\u2019re real people and we crave interactions. But sometimes we\u2019re unable to understand one another. We fight and argue, kiss and make up, then return to war again. Relationships are complicated. Maybe even delicate. In this sports drama, relationships are a focal point, but not the entire point. While what\u2019s on the surface may be a show about dancing. Underneath, there\u2019s much more.\r\nThe story centers around a middle school boy named Tatara. He\u2019s shy, timid and doesn\u2019t really stand out. When his teacher asks him forhis career plans, he can\u2019t answer. Because he has none. No dreams, no aspirations, nothing. So it surprises him when he overhears another student, Shizuku, in the same situation, and thinks she can relate.\\n\\n\r\nOn his way home after school, Tatara coincidentally sees Shizuku and follows her to a building called the Ogasawara Dance Studio. He comes across a tall, blonde man as well. His name\u2019s Sengoku. He\u2019s a professional ballroom dancer and an owner of this studio, which just opened. Short on students, and possibly cash, Sengoku drags Tatara through the door where he forces a free trial of ballroom dancing lessons on him.\\n\\n\r\nInside, Tatara pairs up with Shizuku to learn because this artistic sport requires a couple, usually of opposite genders. The man is the leader. The woman is the partner. A better way to describe this partnership would be like a framed flower painting. The man is the frame and the woman is the flower. \u201cThe frame shall enhance the beauty of the flower and should never let it wilt.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhen the trial is over, Tatara observes Shizuku practicing by herself. Her movements are graceful and enchanting. She\u2019s no amateur. She\u2019s a competitive dancer with hopes of going pro. And Tatara\u2019s shocked to discover that, unlike him, she\u2019s the opposite. She has dreams and aspirations. A future. Tatara storms off, feeling embarrassed for thinking they were alike.\\n\\n\r\nAt home, a dejected Tatara finds a DVD tucked inside his school bag. It\u2019s a copy of one of Sengoku\u2019s old ballroom competitions. Curious, he watches it in a dark and cold room. As the TV flashes on, a wave of warmth light washes away the frozen shadows behind Tatara. It dazzles him. He sees Sengoku dance. He hears his thoughts, and he feels his emotions. But more than that, he\u2019s welcomed to the magical realm of competitive ballroom dance. It speaks to him. It hooks him. And so Tatara, who has nothing, resolves to change.\\n\\n\r\nThe story goes on to track Tatara and his struggles to learn ballroom dancing. His goal? To change from nothing to something. To become a pro ballroom dancer like Sengoku. And to stand on the same floor as the other dancers he meets.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s Shizuku, of course. There\u2019s also her partner, Hyoudou, a dance genius with a cold and icy personality. A brother and sister couple: Gaju, an athletic freak that behaves like a dog, and Mako, a gentle girl who appears to love her brother too much. And finally, there\u2019s Chinatsu, a bold and fierce female dancer who\u2019ll become Tatara\u2019s equal.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough these characters are interesting and do undergo some development, the focus will become mostly fixated on Tatara. It\u2019s especially visible in the second half of the series, where the other main characters are relegated to commentators \u2013 albeit to still keep them involved while we see and understand certain intricacies of ballroom dancing through their eyes.\\n\\n\r\nA particular thing that does stand out is the drama among each partner couple. To clarify, each leader and partner dance pair squabble like husband and wife. Because beneath this layer of endless fighting lies a theme about marriage and separation. At one point, Sengoku even compares dance partners to married couples. Likewise, Tatara\u2019s family doesn\u2019t appear much throughout the series. There\u2019s his father and his grandma, but no mother present. Later, it\u2019s revealed that his parents divorced, and the one memory he has of his mother is her cold departure out the door.\\n\\n\r\nAnother theme that\u2019s more apparent is transformation. Several of the characters experience a range of change, but Tatara\u2019s the most obvious. He develops physically and spiritually. There are even visual cues that help illustrate the development, such as flowers and doors. Flowers help demonstrate the dancer \u201cblossoming\u201d on the floor. Doors show the character locking away his real feelings; when unlocked, the character opens up and shows his true self.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if there was a weakness in this anime, it might be pacing and animation. Some parts seem slow, other parts feel fast. For instance, most of the dance sequences during the competitions are breezed by with still frame shots until the last round, where only a few glimpses of a routine can be seen animated. Even then, there are things added to the dance scenes that disrupt the flow and momentum of the performance, such as too many flashbacks and too much commentary by other characters.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the show is dominated by dancing one thing after the next \u2013 practice, competition, practice, competition. Often times, it looked like there wasn\u2019t much room to breathe. It needed a break amidst all the dancing. Maybe further interaction between Tatara and his classmates at school, or his family at home. Anything. Because, other than that, the setting takes place almost entirely inside dance studios and stadiums in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nSound may be one of the anime\u2019s strengths. The voice actors really do a fine job embodying their roles and adding life to their characters. For example, Tatara sounds like a nervous child at the start, but grows to sound more like a confident adult by the end. Even some of the minor and supporting characters exhibit a nice vocal color. Plus, the music compliments the dance scenes elegantly and powerfully. It\u2019s composed and arranged by Yuki Hayashi, who\u2019s also worked on the original soundtrack for Haikyuu!! and Boku no Hero Academia. If the music does one thing adequately, it\u2019d be synchronizing with the dancing in a way that builds and intensifies the emotions.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the show does a fair job presenting ballroom dancing to a new audience. But \u201cBallroom e Youkoso\u201d is not just a story about dancing, but about self-discovery. It\u2019s about finding a passion and a purpose. About taking the first step to changing and transforming. About finding inner happiness and loving oneself. Perhaps, it can be best expressed by the words Tatara himself repeats at the beginning and references in the end:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cIf there was just one thing. Something that I could say I loved. I feel like I could change.\u201d\\n\\n",

            "content": "UNBIASED WELCOME TO THE BALLROOM REVIEW \r\n(Minimal Spoilers)\r\n\"If there was only one thing. Something that I could say that I really love. Then maybe I could change\"\r\nI have watched Welcome to the Ballroom since it came out and I was really excited of what it can become in the future. Having seen the studio doing this anime (Production I.G) I never thought of the possibility of having lower than great animation. I was just expecting a nice and comfy ride with hype moments, the shounentard that I am. So this is my overall thoughts in Welcome to the Ballroom.\r\nStory 8/10 \r\nI'm not really a professionalin rating a story, but I'd say it's very good. It's about accepting who you are and fight through the struggles of life with a smile. Strive to succeed no matter what it is and enjoy every moment as much as you can. \\n\\n\r\nOur MC, Fujita Tatara, is a boy without a clear direction in life. Growing in a broken family of sorts, he only lives with his father and is really secretive about himself. It all changed when he met Sengoku, a pro dancer, after saving him from bullies. He is now recommended by Sengoku to try dancing and it began changing his life.\\n\\n\r\nThe start may be cliche, heck it may sound like the start of a \"certain\" sports anime out there from the 2000's (you'll know if you watched alot of sports anime\". But it has it's charm and can pull the audience to the dancing world.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nComing from the team that made Haikyuu, I expected this series to have great animation and art while maintaining consistency. I was kinda wrong because the first half of this series is really inconsistent. Consistency wise, the first 5 episodes were really good with its animation, but when the competition arc approached (except the finale ofc) , it became a little unsteady resorting to still frames.. (alot of em). the second half really improved. It's not the ABSOLUTE worse don't take it wrong but I expected a little more if you know what I'm saying\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYuki Hayashi is back with a phenomenal soundtrack that screams dancing. The use of vocals in this anime, though not much, makes me hyped as heck. As expected from the composer of My Hero Academia, he understands what works and what doesn't and he is not afraid to diverge from his previous works.\\n\\n\r\nSome might say that people can't actually hear the ballroom music playing because it is substituted by Yuki's soundtrack and I understand but it not the soundtrack at fault but the direction the staff took.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAside from the few shounen tropes the series has, the diversity of the characters are really good. I like almost all the characters in the series. Even the MC has his differences with other shounen protagonists. (minor spoilers) Tatara's second partner is also interesting herself which makes great chemistry. You might start to hate the MC a little (I did) because of his gutlessness (if that's a word) but upon finishing the series up I finally understood him a little and became proud of what he has become at the end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8//10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThough slow at times, I really recommend Welcome to the Ballroom. It is a series that can make you feel inspired and try new things that you yourself haven't thought about doing. The characters are well diverse and likable. The animation is a little inconsistent in the first half (especially the final arc of the first half) but regains itself in the second half. The last 4-5 episodes of the series was really good and if there was a second season announced, you know I'll be there. \\n",

            "content": "Ballroom e Youkoso revolves around a boy named Fujita, Tatara who ended up stumbling upon a dance studio and learning about Ballroom dancing. This review will be coming straight from another dancer who is more than familiar with Ballroom dancing.\r\nStory: 10\r\n  Fujita is an third-year middle school who is unsure what to do with his life. He gets harassed by delinquents and ends up at an dance studio. This can seem like quiet a typical anime where the main character is unsure what to do with his life and ends up stumbling upon something that can fill this hole. However, the story goesat an nice and accurate pace leading to Fujita actually believing this is the \"something\" that will fill his hole. The learning of the style Ballroom in this anime is done correctly as it starts with the basics and includes many of the most important details when it comes to learning Ballroom. Fujita who does not have many friends makes friends along the way. The story is not predictable and includes quiet interesting arcs. The first arc introduces Fujita and his problems as well as the introductions to the friends he will soon make. The second arc is mainly his competitions and his meeting with Chinatsu.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\n The art was very well done. The animators did an amazing job with the movements of the dance. They made the dance visually beautiful adding factors of intensity and elegance with their art style. Throughout the anime the art stays consistent and they make the dances progressively more beautiful with the addition of their own symbolism. The last episode has the best art as the final dance is performed the best therefore making it the most visually stunning out of all the previous ones.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\n Music in the anime is very accurate. The music that goes with the Foxtrot, Swing, Waltz, Tango, and Quickstep is very accurate and sounds amazing. The openings and endings as well are done well. The 2 openings for the anime both have more upbeat and faster pace to them compared to the endings which are a bit slower pace compared to the openings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\n Tatara: He is quiet shy and awkward in the beginning of the story but is changed with dance. Dance helps him to break out and be more out of his shell.\\n\\n\r\n Chinatsu: She is introduced after half of the anime is done but her impact is memorable. She becomes Tatara's partner and helps him to break out of his shell and helps him transform into the dancer he is. She is quiet hot-tempered at times but is a nice person overall.\\n\\n\r\n Shizuku: She is the partner of Hyodo. It could be said that she is only good because of Hyodo's leadership skills.Shizuku doubts Tatara of his skills in the beginning but Tatara looks up to Shizuku and her dancing skills and in the beginning wants to dance on the same stage as her or with her.\\n\\n\r\n Hyodo: He is Shizuku's partner. He has been dancing with Shizuku since he was very little. Hyodo is very experienced in dancing and believes that Tatara is capable of a lot when it comes to dancing but just needs some guidance. He does give Tara guidance here and there when it is seen fit.\\n\\n\r\nMako: Is the partner of her brother. She is the whole reason for the first arc. Mako slightly helps Tatara break out of his shell when he enters one of his first competitions. She is kind and has a naive and innocent style to her character\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\n Overall the anime is very enjoyable. It leaves you waiting to see more and really gets you interested. The story goes at a smooth pace. People who mainly will enjoy this anime is probably people who are into sports animes and competitive anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\n Overall I will give this anime a 9. The story is a bit lacking when it comes to some character development or backstory for some of the characters but does keep you waiting for the next episode and it was so sad to end it! (Hopefully there will be a second season!)",

            "content": "Given all the things I've had available to watch lately, I almost forgot to finish this anime. Watching this anime made me look at what ballroom is, and even read a few articles, to get a better sense of competitive ballroom dancing. \r\nI can't find out much about the manga author, but from what I've read through articles, you'd think the author was an experienced dancer. \r\nBecause anime and manga put a larger emphasis on emotion and expression, you could see how the competition is highly psychological. I felt like I was right there with Tatara, thinking his early dancing was amazing, only to realizehe had a lot to improve upon. I was able to see that the anime was spot-on with how cut throat other female dancers can be, from making snide comments about one's gown, to fashion sense. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was pretty accurate about finding the right partner, fashion sense being a key element in judging, and how it can be an emotional struggle. One specific article sounded like Kugimiya's struggle, and how in the end the gravity of ballroom dance pulled him back in. Apparently, one doesn't simply quit dance. (insert LotR meme here).\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I enjoyed this, I won't lie. When it came to the big competitions, I felt like so much of it was a filler dressed up as an emotional roller coaster. Each big dance felt like it took 10 minutes to express a 3-5 minute routine. Don't get me wrong, I fully enjoyed it. But in the end, I realized how much dance there was, and sometimes I didn't feel like I had enough character development. It wasn't until nearing the end that I felt like we got more story. \\n\\n\r\nIt's still an awesome anime that made me feel like I was living the moments with them, and when I watched, I had to binge. Because of my \"arts\" background, I greatly enjoyed the music and formalities of seeing ballroom dance. There was a time I really wanted to get into it, and sometimes when watching, I highly considered it for myself. What anime does that? :P",

I was already aware of how taxing and strict dancing is but never have I enjoyed seeing a dance as enjoyable as watching the whole anime.\r\nWelcome to the Ballroom begins with Fujita Tatara and his quest to find something that he can love and give his all for. The boy is filled with drive and passionbut has no means to channel it nor has no way of knowing which direction he can take it. That is until he was saved by a man named Sengoku who forces him to watch a dance class. After seeing Sengoku dance in a DVD that was forced on him, he had found the direction he had so longed for.\\n\\n\r\nTatara may be a weak-willed guy that has a lot of negative traits about him but if anything, he is a very real person in my eyes. He can be overconfident, a nervous wreck, and a fool but that is just like who we humans are at many points in our life. But the thing that shows us that he can be someone we can root for is that Tatara has potential and even Sengoku and the other very experienced dancers can see it and are often at times mesmerized by his dancing.\\n\\n\r\nHe makes many rivals along the way who in turn would also become his friends as they not only respect his ability (though not at first) but they are also infected by his emotions when he is on the dance floor. Tatara can be quite creepy for them as they are amazed by the things that he can do and also the fact that he can\u2019t be trained in a normal way. But once he knows what to do then all he needs is one practice to show that he has the steps down pat which is nothing short of amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the show, Tatara becomes a couple with a few girls and it is there that he forms bonds with them and on the dance floor he forms bonds with the males in the anime as they eventually acknowledge him as someone to watch out for especially during competitions. When he paired with Shizuku he lit a great fire in one of the greatest young dancers in Japan, Hyoudou (Shizuku\u2019s partner), and it elevated his dancing to new heights. When he paired with Mako, Tatara turned her into a blooming flower at his sacrifice of the leader role into a full support role and it gave her newfound courage and respect from her partner who is also her brother.\\n\\n\r\nIn the 2nd half of the series, Tatara finally gets his own partner and it was actually the most difficult partner anyone could ask for as it was like trying to control a wild but beautiful horse but in the end they somehow made it work. It should also be noted that the key characters in the 1st half don\u2019t get as much screen time as they did in the 2nd half as the focuses was less on their issues but changes direction on to Tatara, his new partner, and his new rivals. It should also be noted that there are a few romcom scenes but there really isn\u2019t much of a mention of anything romantic between any of the characters at all though save for one guy but one can easily notice the tension between each one of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime really goes into a lot of detail about the many types of dances and the techniques and training required in order to execute them. It was also very informative about the roles of the dancers, the leader and follower. For anyone who has an interest in dancing, this anime may be able to give you some pointers should you ever decide to go into that world.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was definitely dazzling and intense as they really showed how expressive the dancers are and their faces are pretty accurate for how I imagined it would be if I was ever at their shoes. There were even plenty of times where they changed the animation to something that looked like it came from a famous painting just so they could illustrate how chaotic the dance floor actually is. Even the subtlety of the lighting was beautifully animated though it can be hard to notice.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was also very well done as the dancers looked amazing especially on the dance floor, not to mention the beautiful dresses our heroines were wearing. Even the necks which looked kinda weird looked cool as that is probably how it looks even in the source material. Also the intensity in their faces was also quite notable and even their expressions can be somewhat erotic in a way but it fits with the theme and emotion of their dance quite well. The way the art looks for the character\u2019s eyelashes was also quite something unique and was the center of focus of my eyes almost all the time the camera is close up on their faces.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST that was used matched the show very well as the music was engaging and something that I believe we can all easily dance to. They even changed a few notable sounds to fit with the mood a particular scene of the anime was going for. The 1st opening was amazing and something I expected nothing less of UNISON SQUARE GARDEN who makes me wanna dance to almost all of their songs. The 1st ending was also something that I could dance to but it wasn\u2019t as catchy or as fevery as the opening. The 2nd opening felt more dramatic since the series was going for a different direction anyway and the 2nd ending just didn\u2019t leave much of an impression with me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Welcome to the Ballroom is an anime that is intense, passionate, and every bit of a sports anime as any. It is also one of the few sports anime that has gotten me interested in a sport even though this one doesn\u2019t have an Olympic event. The 1st and last one that influenced me to take the sport was Slam Dunk and I have never regretted loving basketball since but this anime just may make dancing my 2nd sport. I just want to see more of this anime and learn more about dancing right now. Just like in the anime, I can feel the infectious emotions of the dancer and it might also infect you.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.

            "content": "Ballroom e Youkoso, adapta\u00e7\u00e3o do mang\u00e1 de mesmo nome pelo est\u00fadio Production I.G, foi uma grata surpresa em diversos aspectos, desde sua produ\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 execu\u00e7\u00e3o de sua proposta, que vale dizer \u00e9 bem incomum e interessante.\r\nAcompanhamos um jovem cabisbaixo por n\u00e3o possuir algo que realmente goste de fazer, quando um certo dia \u00e9 convidado a praticar dan\u00e7a de sal\u00e3o, e \u00e9 ent\u00e3o que encontra algo que realmente sinta vontade de exercer. Vendo por cima, parece apenas um hist\u00f3ria em busca de autoconhecimento que possui elementos clich\u00eas caracter\u00edsticos de Shounen. Entretanto, este n\u00e3o \u00e9 seu \u00fanico g\u00eanero, temos: Drama, Romance, Com\u00e9dia e, em foco, Esporte. E\u00e9 ent\u00e3o que Ballroom e Youkoso brilha, misturando de forma coesa todas as suas naturezas de modo excelente, sendo resguardado por pontos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o bem executados: dire\u00e7\u00e3o, trilha sonora e anima\u00e7\u00e3o.\\n\\n\r\nBallroom e Youkoso trabalha bem todos seus elementos, como o desenvolvimentos dos personagens centrais e o ritmo da trama em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 sua proposta de esporte, que \u00e9 criar competi\u00e7\u00f5es que gerem emo\u00e7\u00e3o no telespectador, al\u00e9m de representar o esporte em si. Em favor disso, temos o ritmo da obra: extremamente agrad\u00e1vel, al\u00e9m de fluida. O anime executa sua hist\u00f3ria de forma com que seus epis\u00f3dios fiquem movimentados e que prendem a aten\u00e7\u00e3o. Muito disso deve-se ao fato do material original, que por sinal \u00e9 bem avaliado. Mas temos um probleminha: o anime adaptou todo o mang\u00e1, sendo necess\u00e1rio que a autora passasse o final da hist\u00f3ria. Por conta disso, sentimos momentos de acelera\u00e7\u00e3o na narrativa, mas nada que prejudique a experi\u00eancia.\\n\\n\r\nEm rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 seus aspectos t\u00e9cnicos, tem-se uma trilha sonora que empolga e emociona nos momentos certos, por mais que n\u00e3o bata com a dan\u00e7a que os personagens est\u00e3o fazendo. Fato que \u00e9 um dem\u00e9rito em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 sua natureza de esporte, que \u00e9 dan\u00e7a de sal\u00e3o, pois se a obra pretende abordar uma atividade que tem um de seus pilares nas m\u00fasicas, logo se n\u00e3o podemos aproveit\u00e1-las, o anime peca. Em contra partida, como dito anteriormente, emociona e empolga, fato que \u00e9 um m\u00e9rito.\\n\\n\r\nNa parte de anima\u00e7\u00e3o, o est\u00fadio Production I.G entrega algo muito acima da m\u00e9dia, com um Character Design detalhad\u00edssimo e sequ\u00eancias lindas, que s\u00e3o pontuais durante o decorrer da hist\u00f3ria. Uso de CG em pequena escala e em momentos em que a anima\u00e7\u00e3o tradicional n\u00e3o daria conta. Al\u00e9m de quadros est\u00e1ticos bel\u00edssimos. Quadros Est\u00e1ticos. Frisei tal ponto porque nas dan\u00e7as tem-se uma mistura coerente entre quadros est\u00e1ticos, anima\u00e7\u00f5es fluidas e pseudo-est\u00e1ticas, al\u00e9m de CG.\\n\r\nVamos l\u00e1: sim, os quadros est\u00e1ticos est\u00e3o presentes, e em grande quantidade, fato que gerou inc\u00f4modo para aqueles que buscavam uma representa\u00e7\u00e3o flu\u00edda das dan\u00e7as. Entretanto, os outros pontos t\u00e9cnicos compensam e disfar\u00e7am estes quadros, colocando efeitos visuais, trilha sonora pesada e intercalando entre cenas mais bem animadas.\\n\r\nA anima\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o respeita o g\u00eanero de Esporte, mas age com perfei\u00e7\u00e3o com o Drama e o Shounen, portanto, depender\u00e1 de voc\u00ea o quanto voc\u00ea busca pela representa\u00e7\u00e3o da dan\u00e7a em si, mas saiba que o anime n\u00e3o decepciona na anima\u00e7\u00e3o e dire\u00e7\u00e3o.\\n\\n\r\nHist\u00f3ria envolvente, bem aplicada e executada, com pontos altos em todos os seus aspectos. Sua forma de narrativa n\u00e3o decepciona, por\u00e9m utiliza de alguns clich\u00eas do g\u00eanero Shounen. O que seria um dem\u00e9rito, mas um \"por\u00e9m\" ainda maior surge: quebra clich\u00eas em maior quantidade do que os utiliza, o que \u00e9 um ponto muito positivo da obra. Possuindo um final satisfat\u00f3rio.\\n\\n\r\nE ent\u00e3o chegamos em um dos pilares principais do anime: o desenvolvimento dos personagens.\\n\\n\r\nConsistente, interessante e bem trabalhado. S\u00e3o essas palavras que definem o desenvolvimento dos personagens de Ballroom e Youkoso, sendo vis\u00edveis os pontos de mudan\u00e7a e foco para cada dupla formada com o protagonista, al\u00e9m dos personagens ao seu redor. Foco para a personagem de cabelo vermelho, sendo a que mais possui personalidade. Os personagens s\u00e3o gost\u00e1veis, alguns mais do que outros, assim como o grau de import\u00e2ncia e participa\u00e7\u00e3o nos arcos, al\u00e9m de serem bem trabalhados.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBallroom e Youkoso foi, como dito anteriormente, uma grata surpresa. Incomum, interessante e muito bem feito, vale a pena dar uma conferida.\\n\\n\r\nHist\u00f3ria: 9\\n\r\nArte: 8\\n\r\nSom: 8\\n\r\nPersonagens: 8\\n\r\nAproveitamento: 9\\n\r\nGeral: 8\\n\\n\r\nMeu primeiro review, espero ter ajudado!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "PLOT: This anime involves a young boy named Tatara-san who decides to take on ballroom dancing! It focuses on him taking part of various competitions and dance lessons that made him grow as a person and dancer. As he continues to struggle... many dancers and his teacher has noticed that he has the potential to be a hell of a dancer, (a force to be reckon with). Half way through the season, a new dancer has come into the game and that has made Tatara's world be shaken even more.\r\nCHARACTERS:\r\nTatara: kind, caring, novice dancer, and a bit shy. He's also a visual learner and canpicture the choreography in his mind. Tatara-san is considered to be an underdog because he started to take on dancing later and not at a young age like everyone in the industry.\\n\\n\r\nShizuku: Incredible dancer and Queen of the Ballroom. \\n\\n\r\nKiyoharu: One of the top dancers in the competition. Before Tatara joined, Kiyoharu was seen to team up with Shizuku on the dance floor.\\n\\n\r\nGaju & Mako: Sibling-duo that are seen on the dance floor. Mako wanted to join with Gaju, but Gaju was hesitant of it back in the day. He didn't like teaming up with her because he is constantly annoyed and underestimated with her abilities. Mako's personality is similar with Tatara. They are kind, quiet and are considered as a underdog in the world of dance.\\n\\n\r\nChinatsu: A young student in the same class as Tatara. She was once a dancer but decided to give it up. She has a mean attitude but is very kind. In the dance floor, she is more a leader than a follower.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: One of my favourite animes to watch this year. The world of ballroom dancing has opened my eyes to see a new perspective. I have a lot of respect for dancers after watching the anime. This anime has taught me that anyone can do anything they wish (as long as they NEVER give up!)",

            "content": "Life is filled to the brim with experiences to be had. There are so many things one can accomplish in this world that it can become easily overwhelming; a pestering question for each individual is who do they want to be in this world of overwhelming choices, what do they want to accomplish, and what are the things they can do to reach for that goal? \r\nSometimes this abundance of choice can be so overwhelming that it's hard to choose. It's hard for one to determine what they love enough to pour themselves into; and sometimes you might not feel a deep connection with anyone activity. The start of this anime conveys that exact thematic element when we are introduced to our main character Tatara. Tatara shares with the audience one of the many human barriers we face as we grow and learn to understand ourselves; not knowing what he wants to do, or where his place may fall in the world. He starts out apathetic, unmotivated, and not having a particular preference for any path in life. \\n\\n\r\nThis is when Tatara finds dance. In a more specific depiction; Competitive Ballroom Dance. Through dance Tatara is able to find himself, to better understand others; and to immerse himself in a world more vibrant and colorful than anything he could have prior imagined. He finds his place, he finds his passion; and through it he finds his motivation to grow and not only become the best version of himself, but to help others achieve the same. \\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the Ballroom has consistently been one of my favorite shows since its release in the Summer season all the way up until the end of the Fall season. It's not only pushed its way through two seasonal bouts of anime but managed to stand above the rest consistently (at least, in my own opinion). It's because I enjoy this show so much that I decided to delete my preliminary review for it simply for the sake of being able to compose a review of the whole show; and, to start this newly composed review, I want to focus on my favorite part of this show: the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Welcome to the Ballroom were; in the best terminology I can think of, balanced. Competitive Ballroom Dancing is a coupled sport; meaning it involves both a man and a woman, and each must play their respective parts in order to excel. I've never seen a series that incorporates both the male and female roles so fluently; we don't simply see our lead character grow - we see his partners grow with him. We explore Tatara and what leads him to the world of dance, we experience his growth; but through the series we witness the growth of his changing partners; Shizuku, Mako, and Chinatsu as well. To be able to so thoroughly explore each character; male or female, is something I normally don't have the pleasure of experiencing in anime. I was able to fully relate to both the male and female, the lead and follow, and because of this was able to thoroughly enjoy the growth of both characters through dance. I was able to understand their world; how their worlds are different from each other; how their worlds are different from my own; and how those worlds combine in their dancing and my viewership. That's an absolute pleasure, and if I were to recommend watching this anime for any one reason in particular, it is this one.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the depth with which the characters are fleshed out; the show does not fall short on story, art, or music either. The story follows a very standard sports show format, but the pacing is phenomenal and I was left each week feeling like I wanted to see more rather than underwhelmed with any sort of lack of content. The art was beautiful, and unique - given that with the many anime I have seen this was a rare art style to come across; and the music was in given moments exceptional. To comment on the OST I'd have to say I quite enjoyed the OP and ED, as well as the compositions that made the dance segments seem all the more engaging; there were times where the music wasn't of much interest, but this complimented scenes where the music was not suppose to take the forefront of the viewers attention; and when the music was meant to take a forefront... Oh boy. \\n\\n\r\nTo say the least I quite enjoyed Welcome to the Ballroom; more so than many of the sports animes I've seen because of how the characters were incorporated, and far more than I had thought I would stepping into the anime. I highly recommend this show; and I hope others can unexpectedly enjoy the world of Ballroom Dance as I have. Now stand tall (or sit up straight(?)) - \"Your posture reflects how people see you\" - and go watch Ballroom e Youkoso.",

            "content": "SPOILER FREE \r\nthis show is another excellent show on the sport genera from production ig. before talking about the plot and characters ill talk about the animation and soundtracks, as I feel these are important to this show almost if not as much as the characters and plot (ill usually forgive bad animation/soundtracks if the story and characters are well made).\r\nart (10/10):\r\nI really like production ig animation. in ballroom the animation was what I expected and was just great. this kind of art style appeal to me a lot and while it's a matter of taste I don't think there will be many people ifany that will tell you the animation is bad. the only thing you might find weird is the long neck the characters have (a common thing in the dance world) and that they don't animate enough of the dance but rather more of one shots of it. I still found these one shots to be incredible and when they animate the dance it's beautiful.\\n\r\nanother thing I liked was the fact that even when the show do some dresses that are sexy you wont feel like this is a fan service unless the show wants you too (chi-chan dance half naked and it doesn't feel at all like fan service) but rather the whole thing feel like part of the dance (as it should be) and just something natural. the art work great for the show and help the plot and characters feel smother.\\n\\n\r\nsound (10/10):\\n\r\nill start with the voice actors. I think they did a fine job. not too many highlights but no bad parts really. \\n\r\nthe soundtracks and ops are wonderful. they fit the tone of the show and of course the dance. the show's soundtracks and ops will make you want to dance too. they are really good. it help the plot feel more alive and make you more invested n it.\\n\\n\r\nplot (7/10):\\n\r\nI don't like to go to specifics about the plot. ill say this can be really interesting and great plot at times but it has it's downfalls. at some points I didn't really care about the plot and there was this one asspull (you know what I am talking about if you seen the show). overall, not the most interesting or amazing plot but not bad.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters (7/10):\\n\r\nI wont go in details here as well. let's just say it's going to be a ride. some characters are good, some mediocre and some plainly bad (not a lot though). the mains got enough development but it could have been handled better. the side characters either got really good development (best example is kugimya), bad development (best example is akira) or were just left without showing up enough or get enough development (why did you leave hongou!). overall, some characters are great some are not so great. still worth watching.\\n\\n\r\noverall (8/10):\\n\r\nthe show is quite good and I recommend you to watch it. it's not a long show and is a nice ride. don't think this show is an amazing masterpiece but is indeed worth watching.",

Firstly, i was happy that the great amazing manga is finally getting recognition and make an anime out of it & i was just generally happy that i'm gonna see the dances to be animated. because let's be honest there are not alot of anime with the concept of \"dancing\". Secondly, i was scared because i thought they might ruin the anime by adding fanservices and such.\\n\\n\r\nSo, let me tell i'm soooo glad and thankul i didn't drop this and as far as i see it the show is very entertaining and original.\\n\r\nYou could feel every emotion and hard work the producers and animators put in every episode, it's been such along time since i've watched an anime where i just enjoy the beauty of it and i was excited every week to watch a new episode\"even though i know the story because i read the manga lol xD\"\\n\\n\r\nI suggest that you give this anime a shot and watch, it's enjoyable and fun to watch. Also go read the manga it's really good.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, i hope this review helped and encouraged you to watch it.",

This anime has undeniable elegance and freshness to it. \r\nFrom the beginning, you're introduced to a character whom you can share the same emotion with. Confusion and the unawareness of what awaits. But slowly as you trace the footsteps of Tatara you'll experience the sharp, calculated, and fiery world of ballroom dance together, both on and off the dance floor. \r\nThe story is fresh and intriguing, with tension that could be cut with a knife. The art, sound, and characters all mesh together to bring the mangato life, serving justice while doing so. With those ratings out of the way, the enjoyment factor is outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict is to just give it a try.",

For your characters,there is the usually rival,the girl the the main character sort if like but likes the rival,the siblings who are usually together but got a fit,one of the sibling join the main character beat the other sibling in a tournament,who then go back to the other sibling who later becomes the other rival(Not the sibling who join the MC)\\n\r\n(Sorry for my review being a messy but i hope you can understand what i am saying about the anime since i'm not very good at making reviews)  \\n",

            "content": "Welcome to the Ballroom got a good deal of fanfare a couple years earlier where I did have interest in wanting to check it out thanks to its rather unique focus on ballroom dancing, until I heard reception eventually got mixed and underwhelming to what it offered up. That still had me interested in seeing what made it a mixed bag among fans considering the ballroom dancing premise had storytelling potential on paper. However as I watched the anime's 24-episode TV run, I started to see the rather glaring flaws that made the hype for it quickly fizzle out.\r\nWelcome to the Ballroom is in essencea shounen sports anime that features its male lead taking up a sport to find meaning for himself and develop greater self-confidence in his capabilities. In spite of this rather cliched element, the premise could work if the lead's character development comes off as engaging and has likeable characters serving to support or rival him in his efforts. However, Welcome to the Ballroom has a nice number of issues with elements to this storytelling premise. As our male lead, Fujita is rather milquetoast as he is frequently unsure of himself throughout the span of the anime's run and I never got much sense that he was growing as a character as he improved his dancing skills and gained more experience within ballroom competitions. Many of the other characters are not much better as a number of them have rather obnoxious and unlikable personality traits that made relating to them difficult at many points throughout Welcome to the Ballroom.\\n\\n\r\nA prominent issue with the anime is that it doesn't allow for much opportunity to see things from the perspectives of the female characters. Shizuku and Mako, for example, made for some of the more tolerable and likeable characters within the anime who had roles in supporting Fujita's growth during the first half of the anime. However, the anime devoted little time to exploring their characters and motivations, and largely focused on Fujita's training and ballroom dancing. Some have ripped the anime as being sexist for assuming it regards its female cast largely as props and usually sexual objects with some scenes featuring male characters ogling the girls and a few random service shots of female characters. While I could see where this criticism comes into play, the anime gradually breaks from this trend in later episodes. However, it still doesn't devote enough focus on female characters and trying to make the majority of its cast more likeable.\\n\\n\r\nThe major issue that I have with Welcome to the Ballroom though is that it doesn't really do a good job of representing what the world of competitive ballroom dancing is like. Sports titles focused on major sports like baseball, basketball, soccer, and racing are accessible to audiences since there is greater awareness of the rules and training for them, thus making them relatable to the audiences that watch the tribulations of the major characters participating in them. Competitive ballroom dancing does not fit into such accessibility, thus creating a learning curve for audiences unfamiliar with the sport to learn about elements to it like types of dancing, rules in competitions, how dance performances are judged, and how dancers train. While there is mention of elements to ballroom dancing, the anime never goes into depth on them as it is more focused on the ongoing developments of its plot and characters. Without being able to properly understand the rules and dancing styles employed for ballroom dancing, this reduces the relatability that the series could have to draw audiences into caring for the developments of its characters, who already have their issues as I highlighted above.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Welcome to the Ballroom is mostly wasted potential. While having a unique premise on paper, this is largely wasted on a mostly unlikable cast of characters, not enough focus on female characters, and doing a rather poor job of making its sport of focus accessible and relatable to audiences unfamiliar with it. Unless you have a solid understanding on what the world of competitive ballroom dancing is like, I would suggest skipping this title.",

And yeah, I know its an original ending. Still, it was written and supervised by the author itself, that\u2019s why it was still so satisfying. I might say, its one of the best original ending I had ever seen. Maybe I\u2019m kinda biased, but nah, so be it.\r\nI really really love this anime. I enjoyed watching this every week. From the story to the long necks, I appreciate them all. I do admit, it had some flaws hereand there. Even so, it didn\u2019t stop me from liking this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I need to stop rambling how much I love this anime, and just give details as to why I love this anime. Lol.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, was generic at best. Its a typical sports anime premise on the surface level, and its pretty much okay. What made this series really good was the progression of the story and how it was told. If I look at this in the perspective of the people who were \u2018anime only\u2019 , I could definitely say this anime was really well-paced from beginning to end. It was consistent and the story flowed really well. But in manga reader\u2019s perspective, I did find some flaws in the anime. There were times that the anime felt rushed and slower than usual, it was sometimes hard to watch. I agree on both perspectives, they are all reasonable arguments after all, especially the manga reader\u2019s perspective. I was once a anime only watcher of the anime, but after reading the manga, I could definitely say that they could have done it better. I won\u2019t spoil much and just be vague about it, there were some scenarios in the manga that I think would work out really well if it was added in the anime too. It would add more depth to the characters and add more flavor to the story. Nevertheless, I am kinda contented with how things were done in the anime. It had flaws, but its still good.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were really likable. I love everyone, I couldn\u2019t hate any character. All the characters introduced were not shallow, but instead they were really realistic and interesting. They are very relatable and as a viewer, you understand how they feel. I think I already expressed how much I love this certain character before, but I\u2019m still going to gush over how much I love this person. Chichan is \u2764 .\\n\\n\r\nYes, you read that right. Chichan is best girl. I love everything about her. She is raw, independent, hot-blooded individual. I just love her character. I also love her relationship with Tatara. It might look abusive and a bad relationship, but thats only on the surface level. They both need each other so that they can grow and become a better person and a better dancer. You know what, I just love this show. XD\\n\\n\r\nLet us not forget the art and animation. To be honest, I was kinda iffy with the Haikyuu-ish artstyle & animation, the long necks and curvy curves were both not helping. But after watching it for some time, I became accustom to it and I find it fitting to the story. The exaggeration of the animation made the series more unique and entertaining. For the animation of the dance, I\u2019m pretty much okay with everything. Dunno about you, but I have heard quite alot of noise from different viewers about the minimum animation on the dance. I don\u2019t blame them, this is a dancesport anime after all. At least they went all out in the last episode. They animated the dance routines really well, even though its still looked exaggerated. I pretty much don\u2019t care.\\n\\n\r\nBoth the OP & ED songs from the 1st cour & 2nd cour were really really good. It gave me eargasms everytime I listen to it. If I were to choose which were the best OP song, it would be the 2nd OP, \u201cInvisible Sensation\u201d by UNISON SQUARE GARDEN. I just loved it more than the first OP. For the best ED song, I would choose the first ED, it feels more fitting to the series compared to the 2nd ED.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series is worth a watch. I definitely recommend this anime to everyone. I know there were some flaws here & there, but all in all, the series was very enjoyable. I might binge-watch this in the future when the I could have my own BD copy of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "For those who had seen this series, know that your enjoyment is first before the road that took you here. Whether you were looking for another Lie in April or romance On Ice, what you get here locks you into a captivating journey of young Tatara and his passion for Ballroom Dancing.\r\nBefore I go into the review, I just want to say that I appreciate the author for what she went through to get to get this far. She has a long period of health issues and it is it an honor to witness her passion as well as her flaws in the adaptation. Themanga is by no mean finished and is actually behind the anime, but this still beats out the alternate ending of Elfen Lied and Deadman Wonderland from their manga by a long shot.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10: \\n\r\nThe story is as shonen as it gets, at least for a brief moment. The guy likes a girl and pursuit something that he sees himself doing and to earn the glory for his chance to be with the girl. He is shy and dorky yet  He gets a coach that is secretly, greatly famous and has a mentor to look up to. With supportive friends and families as well as rivals, he began his journey to prove to the dancefloor that he belongs. Unfortunately, this is where the shonen stops. He gets beaten, took losses and lose the ideal vision he sees in his past. He has to grow and adapt to the situation while maintaining a strong passion for his art. He gets to meet with the ugly side of dancing and loss faith in himself numerous times. Does he ever give up? Yes. However, the cast is there to lift him up and give him a helping hand every so often, even when they are not there. He helped them in return and grow a bond forged through hardship and ambition. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7.5/10:\\n\r\nLong Necks? Yeah, get on with it. Reusing shots after shots and moving a picture left and right for a more than a conservative amount of time? Some moments, this works. Many, do not. Otherwise, background, effects, choreography, and scenes are all nicely timed, placed, narrative executed.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9.5/10:\\n\r\nClassic + Classy = Casablanca. The scenes matched the feel of each track as well as the style of animation. It simply does not care about the background music played for that performance but for the scenes it portrays. Its a mixed shift, but not unwelcoming. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\r\nAs explained earlier, Tatara is annoying yet charming for any veteran anime watcher. As shown by a certain hero still in Academia, this MC is malleable for any show (or disaster) and the adaptation served as the frame that lets him blossom and blossom he did.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is a strong pillar in this story, the water and soil to Tatara so to speak. Not only are they are nicely developed, but their lingering presence after their major moments still garner the attention of great importance. To give the supporting cast and Tatara a dancefloor and then let them grew just as he did with Chinatsu is nothing shorter than necessary. They don't always correspond very well with each other, but they are bound to each other and navigate their way through the world of dance. One of the major flaws of Yuri on Ice is the cast. Some very developed while other took a huge dip in the backstage. This show also balanced out the arc and make them important to all the casts and leave every episode on a very high note, for better or worst. Even the villains are just people with as much to lose as Tatara and their moment of realization and peace leaves an imprint in my mind. Even Tokyo GHoul sometimes faltered in this.\\n\\n\r\nSome may argue that the characters have flaws, such as Kiyoharu's weird edgy moments and the ball being passed less to Chizuku as the show progressed. However, the later episodes have no adaptation to really draw from and the author can only do so much. Unfortunately, many people dislike Tatara for his more spineless and indecisive moments like other main anime characters. This is WRONG! It took a long time to get to, but the brief scene you see his mother leaving him shows just how much this affected him. He moved on since then, yes, but for a guy with divorced parent and a poor economic situation, his lacks of confidence are very logical. In fact, apart from those moments, the show seems to develop a good flashback for every social flaw each character expose in the series. It may not be as potent as March Comes in Like a Lion or as bloody epic as Tokyo Ghoul, but the road the characters in these series took to get to where they are is brimming with purpose. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nWhy? It gets me tears rolling down and feelings spilling out. This show is classy and necessary. It is driven with passion and honesty so strong that it twists the narrative into reality. To hold my feeling so tights and grasping my needs for a dose every week, it made me feel alive. The music, art, and characters are a family worth meeting. Will it get a sequel? Will I get a sequel? Life is too cruel not to.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendations: Nodame Cantabile, Your Lie in April, Yuri!! On Ice, Haikyuu, Bay Step, March Comes in like a Lion and My Hero Academia.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n10/10\\n",

When I say dance i really mean it: The animation, the visuals, the music, the movement, the aesthetics, everything makes someone really feel, enjoy and live their performances, with pasion, with sadness, with anger. This may be the strong point of Ballroom (at least for me) They're terribly good at shooting emotions to the viewer with totally messedup animation full of movement, effects and dynamism. As a person that have been trought the world of academic, competitive art, I identify myself with this kind of anime. And I can say for sure that the world of art is cruel, crude and you need your guts to be prepared for a non-stop study of whatever you do. This story show us really accurately how this works, and how do people go throught it. Some of them may be kinda OP, or better said, over talented, but everyone has it's ups and downs, and well, what can I say. You have to watch this, if you like dance, better, if you don't you're gonna like it after seeing this. The conbination of the animation, the music, the world, the long-necked characters with super flexible bodies, makes Ballroom e Youkoso an anime full of thrill, the choreographies are outstanding, the characters are good enought. \\n\\n\r\nThe music could be much better thought, it amazes me that they didn't made a great effort to have a better soundtrack. Maybe, with an amaizing soundtrack, and less flashbacks and a little more of steps, I would totally give Ballroom e Youkoso a good 10/10.",

Expect main characters to have necks longer than their heads -literally-.\r\nRemember some shows when they had 15 minutes of talking and 5 minutes of fighting?\r\nIn this case you will see an average 3 minutes ofdancing per episode, without many dancing moves and being repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall story was good, the only thing that kept me from dropping it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were attractive and their introduction was good.\\n\\n\r\nArt was decent and chrisp , but the animation had a lot of flaws.\\n\\n\r\nFor a dancing anime you expect to hear a lot of music, in this case the music was barely heard with the characters talking.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end, don't expect a lot from it. There aren't many dancing shows right there and this one did a fair job, but could've been better.",

            "content": "It has to be commended that Ballroom e Youkoso tries to do something very special and succeeds to a certain extent, using a male and female team sport the sport aspect is treated as a romance plot and the romance elements are directly tied to the sport. It's not just jumping the hurdle of using time for love interests that most sport shonen struggle with, it straight up takes elements from a romance plot and presents it with the passion and structure of a sport plot while covering most of what you want in the sport genre.\r\nThe first half works perfectly for anyone who likesany of those genres, and even better if you enjoy both. The animation is a bit choppy and they do the absurd mistake of replacing the music they are dancing to with generic anime mood music. We only get a few moments of synced animation since they somehow felt there was no need for that (less than a year after the success of Yuri on Ice)\\n\\n\r\nThis is a minor issue for the first half since the concepts they present in classic sport fashion keep you too busy to care. But the second half drops the previous plots and takes 5 episodes to build new characters and conflicts, with most development moments shown entirely again over the final match. The training camp arc can be perfectly skipped since you'll see it again in no time. The characters previously developed become part of the mob commenting on the new main pair (the kind of job left to secondaries or new characters in most sport shows). So you are left with a mixture of a very long clip show, people talking and still frames of something that could be dancing but doesn't reflect the points they get. The romance aspects are reduced to a tsundere couple that has to learn to fight together instead of each other, and the sport element  is pretty hard to follow since the sport itself has a very vague point system (you never know if they did good or bad until someone says outloud what happened while you were watching them frozen in time).  \\n\\n\r\nIn general terms the first half is a strong 8 or even a weak 9 with new and very good akes on the genre and designs that stand out and give a ton of dynamism; while the second half struggles to reach a 5. This clash really ends up hurting the overall enjoyment, not only resulting in an underwhelming ending but making you realize how poor the production values always were. \\n\\n\r\nIt still managed to make me cry a couple of times, which is the biggest measure of a sport anime success. I think that an abridged movie would help a lot if a second season ever comes, but I'd recommend just reading the manga.",

            "content": "The series has many similarities with yuri on ice mainly due to its protagonist and his way of gaining confidence and experience. In addition this anime can be considered better than YOI since from the second part of the series improves its script with the introduction of Hiyama Chinatsu, a tsundere girl who slowly becomes lovable.\r\nPreviously emphasize that the second part is better in the argument and that is because Tatara doubts a lot in his motivation. I must add that Shizuku Hanaoka is a despicable character despite being presented as someone great, his personality is empty, outside the fact of being beautiful is uselessto endear yourself to her.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I compare this series to yuri on ice is because of the artistic section and the cast of characters, the animation looks very beautiful but it's fluid in terms of animation frames does not show us all the movements and does not bother to explain the basics of the dance (in the same way that YOI did not explain how ice skating was).",

            "content": "Did you know competitive ballroom dancing is a thing? Because I didn't.So I don't see why no one watched this show though.Since everyone was watching Made in Abyss and Kakegurui, and this show already looked like a copy of Yuri on Ice, thats probably why. But this show should not be completely forgotten about because it takes the average sports anime and twists it and turns it and adds its own special flavor and makes it stand out from sports anime in a way.\r\nBallroom e Youkoso(Welcome to the Ballroom) is about this guy,Fujita, getting pulled into the world of competitive dancing and tries to \"bethe very best like no one ever was\" but the down side to it is that he doesn't have as much experience as the others he dances with.This show features him on his journey and obstacles that he overcomes himself.The sport is competitive ballroom dancing,which means two people, the show does at different way of approaching teamwork, it doesnt matter if you're the best dancer ever as long as you have the right cooperation with your partner in both skill and looks.The show starts putting this amateur on the spotlight and afterwards he wants that feeling more and more.It is a very satisfying experience to say the least.The only problems I have with the story is probably the tone.There are times when the characters start getting deep development but then the tone turns into straight up comedy at a whiplash pace.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very interesting in a way.When it comes to the movements when the characters move quickly in dance it can get fluid at times but other times it can get choppy. When the characters are moving in slow motion, it looks very good,and when the characters are not dancing there are subtle details that describe the character through movement albeit few and far between.The foot movements are very detailed. The animation is a bit hindered by the amount of still frames used, they look nice but at times when characters talk about a couple dancing well or not well enough you can't tell the difference unless you  know what you are looking at because ballroom dancing is confusing.It's cool seeing the mirror in the studio to show two of the same area at different angles and they are carefully made. I have seen the other shows that Production IG have done especially with sports. This show is not the best to be done by them but it's still good looking. The character designs are very nice too.At the right times. When no one is dancing and it's just their regular lives going down they look like regular high school kids ripped out of a shoujo manga, but everything changes on the ballroom floor. The hairstyles kick in, the amazing looking ballroom apparel is put on and the necks become elongated.The necks are very long but it is only at certain times where the character is the basis of the entire screen.When the show needs to cut costs, it goes to reusing frames and flashbacks to scenes. The actual expressions and hairstyles are hit and miss, there are times where you have Mako who is one  of the cutest anime characters ever and in other cases you got Gaju who looks like a Doritos mascot and Masami and his partner who look like straight up drug addicts. On the bright side is was not much of a hassle to figure who I am looking at.One detail that is irrelevant but still nice to me is the detail put in when competitors get ready to dance.The tags on the companies their clothes come from. And how the females have a little dress tent when they get ready. Also seeing others put on their makeup it brings in anticipation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a mixed bag. It varies on four different occasions:Slice of Life, Drama, Ballroom Dancing , and Motivational,The dramatic part of the music is surprisingly nice. It is very ambient and foreboding and I like it. The slice of life aspect of the soundtrack does its job of not taking the spotlight because that is what the Ballroom dancing music is for. When that type of soundtrack hit's it gets good real quick but the sad part is that the majority of the time the music is switched out for this motivational music that is cheesy AF.It is just so melodramatic that you might as well take it and put it in a motivational video with some guy screaming quotes at you. That is one factor why sports anime is not my favorite to watch but everything else makes up for it because the sport in this show is so complex that the characters get affected in a way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe main character Fujita was alright. I feel like his interest in dancing is a bit shoehorned in at the start because he is not even sure if he wants to do it but he is so passionate about it at the end of the show.He may be crap at dancing but he does a good job of observing someone else and mimicking their skill set but it's not enough.He digs himself a hole at times and he doesn't solve them because it's not necessary for a sport like this. From my interpretation of this sport in the show, It doesn't matter how hard you practice if you can't show it in such a presentable fashion with the help of your partner and that is the one hurdle that Fujita has to cross with Mako and Chinatsu.Mako is a character that had the graciousness of being focused on despite the fact she is not a main character. In the second half this girl comes from nowhere,Chinatsu, and as a character, she is an antithesis of the problem that the main character has.It is something that should be experience by you,the reader. It is worth it. The other characters get affected in a way because of Fujita's nature and his \"coach\",Sengoku, is useless.He has experience and is talented but he is so lazy.I am not a huge fan of him at all.And the villain who is not a villain is a bit ambivalent and is the embodiment of the convergence of Taylor Swift and Internal Conflict with hobbies .Doesn't make sense? Thats what i'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the characters aren't the highlight of the show, like the sport itself, each element is strong but not strong enough on it's own.This show is a commemorative effort on all sides to portray the art and the competitiveness of ballroom dancing and if you have the time and sick of watching Haikyuu or Kuroko no Basuke give this a go.You won't forget about it.\\n\r\nOverall-8\\n\r\nI forgot to mention how amazing the opening themes are, they are.\\n",

            "content": "Ballrook e Youkoso has left me in a state of inspiration that, while many other anime have been able to bring me the same feeling, has never connected quite this deep before. There are many aspects of this show that really stand out, whether it's for better or for worse, but the overall production was incredibly enjoyable. The best way for me to express my exact feelings about the show would be to break it down to each MAL category. \r\nStory (9):\r\nWhile the story of Ballroom isn't exactly revolutionary, it is something that many people can relate to on some level. It's a very typicalsports anime story line wherein the protagonist starts a sport in a new environment where they are forced to learn and adapt. Specifically, I'm reminded of the beginnings to Haikyuu and Hajime no Ippo. Our main character, Tatara, discovers dancing and becomes enthralled by the idea of it. Most viewers can immediately relate to him in the sense that neither party has much knowledge about dance, so they learn along with him. However, the story picks up and really stands out to me from other sports anime as it begins to emphasize the emotional relationships between characters and their partners. From the get-go we begin learning about couples, their individual stories and matchmaking stories alike, and grow an attachment to them that makes us want to root for them. While  dance can take up much of the screen time, I find that the story is really about discovering oneself and becoming in tune with those different from you. It's difficult to explain without reciting the synopsis or delving into character (which is for another category) so I'll move on.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7):\\n\r\nSo, as you will read from many others, the art does leave a lot to be desired. In fact, I would rate it lower if not for it's beautiful style. The facial expressions and imagery used were often incredible, but sadly, animation is an aspect of art in anime as well. The still shots due to the budget were probably unavoidable, but the way the camera cut to and from dancers and the audience was very distracting, and took a lot away from the visual immersion. This is something that could have easily been fixed through scene rearrangement, but it wasn't, and the product simply seemed sloppy at times. However, I can't say enough how gorgeous I found the style by itself. Especially nearing the end of the show, I couldn't help but gasp at the beauty of some shots. The somewhat poor animation barely took away from my enjoyment of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7): \\n\r\nThe majority of the soundtrack was appropriate, catchy, and very pretty overall. My problem throughout the show is how the soundtrack was used. The music being danced to would suddenly be interrupted by a more tense or exciting tune, and while I can understand that choice, it takes away from the immersion, much like the art. Half the time I would see dancing, but not hear what they were dancing to. In fact, I think some of the problems with dancing animation could have been fixed if the music was kept through the scene to maintain fluidity. The way the music was used in the show was a bit painful for me, but the pieces overall were very good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9):\\n\r\nThe characters are the biggest part of the show for me. Tatara is clearly flawed, and much of the show is geared towards him noticing and minimizing those flaws. One big flaw he has is meekness, and how he has difficulty taking control of a situation properly. He's seen either backing off too quickly or trying to force the direction. However, he works hard so that this along with his other flaws don't get in the way of his main partner in the second half of the show. This brings me to Chinatsu, the said partner. She is also incredibly flawed, but one of those flaws is her stubbornness, which makes it difficult for her to change. She and Tatara are an interesting match because she needs strong direction, or she won't take any at all, and Tatara is not very good at giving such strong directions. The clashes between these two were very compelling, and kept me wanting more. There are also stories such as Akira's and Masami's that had me wide-eyed and glued to the screen as I was engrossed in their individual stories, neither of which are too drawn out or brushed over. I believe the character writing in this show is it's strongest point. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8):\\n\r\nThough I would love to give it a higher score, I have to take into consideration how the art and music choices put me off a bit. However, I think this show is worth watching for the character development, interactions, and story alone. It was a beautiful tale of growth that inspired me to become stronger mentally and physically. Despite it's outwards appearance, I would highly recommend watching it.",

Thanks to that we can enjoy a beautiful dancing competition, we can known problems while learning something new and the hardships in creating a dance pair. \r\nThe animation was more or less on high level. Like it is in other anime, studio was saving some money on the animation on the less important thing, however the important scenes were beautifully pampered with details and smooth animation. Than sceneswere very pleasurable for viewer eye. \\n\r\nThe creators did a great job to put a technical description of the dance figure through the conversation of secondary characters, to not overwhelm the viewer. Most of figure were shown through animations which helped to visualize footwork in dance.\\n\r\nCharacters creation was good. Not too much and not too shallow. MC was originally only a pushover and thanks to the meeting the professional dancer, his entire life has changing. Each of the character got their time, when we could become familiar with them.  \\n\r\nI have to admit that music was well suited to the situation, while the songs during the competition were perfectly matched to the dances performed by participants. Although the soundtrack was good, I did not remember it for a long time. On the other hand OP and ED was good and pleasant to listen, especially second OP performed by UNISON SQUARE GARDEN.\\n\r\nAfter watching the entire season I must say that this anime is incredible. 24 episodes were not enough, still want to watch more. Unfortunately this season come to end and what have left now is reading a manga. \\n\r\nI hope that my review turned out to be useful, despite the fact that it is my first :)",

            "content": "As usual in a sports genre, this anime is a good introductory piece. If you're somehow interested in dancing, do not hesitate, watch it. Also, sports genre fans should like it. \r\nOthers, who are not into dancing or sports, probably should try it just because the theme is quite unique. The plot development tempo is good, you won't get bored, I guarantee. While the characters and their motives are quite usual for this genre, they interact in unusual ways. There is some humor too. In conclusion, you won't even notice how the episodes' number increments before you get to the end.\r\nThe animation style is abit unfamiliar. But as soon as you get used to it, you shall find that it is both smooth and dynamic. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is good, and in important moments it becomes superb. \\n\\n\r\nThe dancing itself is fun to watch. It is enjoyable and also you won't be confused because of any lack of understanding. Scenario will provide you with all necessary information about dancing.\\n\\n\r\nI would give this title a score between 8 and 9, but due to the lack of really interesting heroes I stay with 8 for now.",

            "content": "this show is at meh for a while but around the end of episode 5 their was this scene and it blew me away and I must say that is definitely the purpose of the show. It doesn't put a real emphasis on animation or even sound rather it waits for the right moment and sweeps you off your feet. honestly, I cant imagine this show being for everybody but I do recommend checking it out because I didn't think it was for me, and man if it is for you you really don't want to miss it!\r\nso let me give you some warningsjust incase their are some deal breakers. First, if you cant stand bodies that have been (slightly) exaggerated this show could be of putting the characters have long necks as is typical for dancers and they are a bit more angular than a softer looking show like haikyuu. Second the music in the dancing sections doesn't always watch the type of dance they are doing they seem to be going for a scene setting rather than what they are dancing to which was probably my biggest disappointment when watching this show. and Lastly, TEPPU IS NOT A FUCKING ANIME!!! which will probably haunt me till the day I die and how the fuck can they make an anime about competitive dancing when they haven't even made one on mma like seariosly WTF!!!\\n\\n\r\nok so the last point was just me ranting about my favorite manga but I left it in their because any chance I have to premote it I'm gonna take. overall if you can bear with a bit of mediocrity at times this show has some steller peaks that can blow you away\\n",

            "content": "the story is about a boy who doesn't know what he wants to do with his life. he notices a pretty girl with more opportunities than him and later follows her to a dance studio. plot happens and he gets forced into the studio, more plot happens and he wants to dance professionally now. now this is well and all but it's obvious why they got a anime adaptation for this story. It's a complete duplicate of yuri on ice. let me explain, our main character is really good at copying what he watches what others do like yuri on ice's. also, he gets trainedby champions in the respective sport like yuri on ice's and the similarities continue from there. so, of course, I love this show that uses the same formula.\\n\\n\r\nthis show chooses to use something reminiscent of XXXHOLIC's art. that combined with the standard anime art we are used to from older shows. overall it's a dangerous play. It helps add mood to whats happening but it also takes away from it. I can't really pick out if I like it or not. but do their necks really need to be that long?\\n\\n\r\nthe music is pretty good not best of season good or close to but it's still pleasing. the voice actor does stand out that much to me either not that I don't like them. \\n\\n\r\nlike I said before Tatara (main character kun) is a little op for getting good without having a lot of experience being able to do things he hasn't been taught and going with the flow very well including picking up on new partners thinking after recently starting to dance together. he constantly does things pros took a long time to learn even though he is told not to due to it not being as good as the original. this can be a bad thing for a fan base as many people want a character struggle to get up instead of just being talented. I happen to like this character. the others characters are fairly consistent even though we can't get a good read on the girl that he followed into dance and that's a good thing. She is used as a motivational tool for Tatara as the show goes on. we also have Mako and she really had a good first showing you can't help but love her. all of our other characters although side characters play a big part in a plot which other shows fail to do. they did this very well.\\n\\n\r\noverall I'm loving this anime. it's not perfect. but it tells its story right and that goes a long way. 8 or 9 out of 10",
