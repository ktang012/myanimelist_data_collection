            "content": "Are you a lonely, boy-less teenage girl? Do you wish you could have many hot guys surrounded by you, astounded by you for no real reason? What about living in a world where you get to date and be submissive to no, not just one attractive male, but over FOUR of them in many different worlds? Does that sound like the dream life to you? Have no fear, \"Amnesia\" is just what you need to fulfill this!\r\nIn case you don't get the vibe, this is pretty much a reverse harem used primarily for female wish-fulfillment. The story centers around our lead girl, erm, I guesswe just call her Heroine? Because her boyfriends that love her oh so dearly never bother to call her by her name? Yeah. Heroine finds herself awakening with no memories, and it's up to her and a spirit called Orion to collect her memories. She's also trapped in this sort of \"time loop.\" Basically, each time she dies, the date resets. By date I mean both the month and day and her current boyfriend.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has two main issues: the pacing and the Heroine. The pacing moves by pretttty damn slowly, to the point where even when we hit episode nine, nearly nothing is known about the main plot or what exactly is going on. The story is supposedly about the Heroine collecting her memories, but uh.. that's probably the least she's done throughout the show. And that's saying a lot, because she hardly does ANYTHING.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here comes our other issue, the Heroine herself. This girl is so bland, so personality-less, and used as such a wish-fullfillment device that she doesn't even have a name. Isn't that awesome, girls? You don't even have to get depressed when hot guy #1 doesn't call out your name! It makes self-insertion much, much easier. Heroine is a story-dragger -- she provides little to no advancement to the plot herself and has to rely on everyone else to push her in any direction possible. Oh yeah, having amnesia ain't excuse for not having a personality. Fucking Nyuu from Elfen Lied had more of a personality then her, and she couldn't even dress herself. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Heroine's reliance, this also brings another issue: she's submissive. Too, too submissive. Almost all the guys do extremely improper things to her, like shoving her against a tree in the middle of the dark against her will or forcefully kissing her, getting too close to her, anything. And she just accepts all of this. She never sticks up for herself, and is even willing to stay with a man whom she pretty much knows will dump her when his time limit is up. Great example, right guys? The male characters ain't any better -- they're all pretty much just a bunch of hot dude's lusting after Heroine for their own fucked up reasons. Some want to play her, others want to lock her up in a cage. You know how it is.\\n\\n\r\nOh uh, the positives? Well, the art is pretty crisp, as expected of Brain's Base. The eyes look downright gorgeous and the opening theme is pretty much eyecandy. The men are attractive, which is a key for these anime, and the backgrounds are well-created. Soundtrack is merely mediocre and unmemorable, though bonus points are awarded for such an awesome opening song. I'm convinced to hear more of Nagi Yanagi's stuff. \\n\\n\r\nSo, enjoyment? I'm sorry, but I'm not the type of person that gets wet from putting myself in the shoes of a nobody and letting all these hot guys date and rape me. If you're the type that's into that, then I'm sure your enjoyment of this will be much, much higher then mine. \\n\\n\r\nNow I will ask you this again -- are you a lonely and angsty teenage girl? Do you dream of many a men surrounding you, kissing you, pinning you behind alley's, and drugging you? Do you want to live in this life? If so, then look no further, my dears. This anime is perfect for you. You got a bunch of hot guys that want your tits and a girl who's so bland that you can insert my chihuahua in it and it would probably make the story more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIf not, just don't watch this. There is literally nothing to be lost and nothing to gain, except time and knowledge on how not to write a shoujo. \\n",

            "content": "Ugh. This show. I wanted to like it so hard. But I ended up wanting to break my tv around episode 3 instead. \r\nStory: The pilot episode pulled me in right away. Girl has amnesia due to an accident with a spirit named Orion and can't tell anyone, but has to learn about her past somehow. Several interesting things happen in the first episode. But it gets awful from there. \r\nI get that this is based on an input based otome or reverse harem game. But the main character is SO uninteresting, boring, and just plain dull! I can't figure out why the male charactersare all so interested in her! She has a few responses to everything: (1) Staring in confusion (eyebrows up in concern), (2) Responding in a whispery \"hai\", (3) Saying \"uh, I, uh...\" and just letting the silence stretch to fill time I guess, and (4) running away or rejection. She rarely asks questions about her situation and the only thing she does to try to improve her situation is writing in a journal. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Oh so ugly! If I were the \"heroine\" (and I say that sarcastically since it seems like she'd just die if the boys weren't around to constantly save her from just about everything), I'd reject them all just based on their fashion sense! \\n\r\nIkki: In purple and black. Wears not only a hairclip but makeup too. \\n\r\nShin: In red and black. Clothes are raggedy and tight AND mismatched. Has one red and one black thigh high, lace up boot. And apparently vampire bites on his chest.\\n\r\nToma: In yellow and black. Headbands. Really? And kind of a checkered, piratey skirt sash thing going on. \\n\r\nKent: In green and black. Dresses like he's cosplaying an emo Vash the Stampede. \\n\r\nThen there's our main character: She wears these red and black plaid tights with a SEA FOAM GREEN dress, tunic thing. Ok, her hair is cute but they ruined that too (read on).\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention the weird style of coloring their eyes? I felt like between the wacky outfits and eyes that I was in some 70s trip. Either that or the creators were TRYING to get rid of some viewers through the shear ugliness of the design. \\n\\n\r\nOne more thing on character design. The main char gets her hair chopped off so dramatically in the first episode that she passes out. Yet when she goes to lament her new style in the mirror it's completely the same. Given the time skipping, I thought this would have made a great way for her to keep track of where she was, what day it was, etc. But no. They gave a cop out and didn't change her design in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The main character (whose name we never learn) is just horrendous. I've already talked about that. The male characters are extremely cliche. There's the emo bad boy, the overly intelligent and socially awkward one, the fun childhood friend, and the playa that all the girls love. \\n\\n\r\nThe boys all carry the story. It's completely up to them. What kills me is that they all notice something is slightly different about the main char, but don't really care or do anything about it. If she was like that before the accident, wow. How the heck did she get so many guys (not to mention her gal pals) interested in her?\\n\\n\r\nHere is an exchange from episode 6: \\n\r\nGirl: (Looks down, looks up in surprise as Ikki goes to stand in front of her.) \\n\r\nIkki: You're not staying over?\\n\r\nGirl: (Looks surprised. You can tell because she gasps.) Um, I...Um... (silence drags)\\n\r\nIkki: It's all right. I'm not hungry like the wolf. I can sleep on the floor. I wont' do anything you don't want me to. It's up to you whether or not you believe me though. \\n\r\nGirl: I, uh... (silence drags)\\n\r\nIkki: What's that face for? (at this point she's just staring at him, completely normal face for her)\\n\r\nGirl: (Staring, silence drags)\\n\r\nIkki: (Staring) (Laughs) Oh come on, you don't have to look so frantic. \\n\\n\r\nWTF? When did she look frantic? These guys are completely carrying the story and imagining things that aren't happening. I find it hard to see this as an anime and not the game it was based on because the main char might as well not even be there. I'm so frustrated with it. I've just completed episode 8 and I'm dropping it from here. First review I've written without finishing a show but I really don't see it getting better. \\n\\n\r\nPlease don't waste your time!",

            "content": "EDIT2016: Please take into consideration that this was written 3 years ago and the things I've written here are quite biased from an otome game fan side. It was meant to be taken as a defense to the reverse harem genre as a whole which was a lot less popular during the time I wrote this than it is now. I must mention that I changed a lot of opinions during the past three years, I've started to want to give more objective opinions, even if sometimes, it's, of course, unavoidable to not be biased; that doesn't mean that I'm discrediting this review. I amstill convinced that Amnesia is NOT the worst reverse anime and most definitely NOT bad, but take mostly the first part with a grain of salt. I'm keeping this review up to note down my own personal growth. Have a nice day!\\n\\n\r\n======\\n\\n\r\nI'm one of those people that gave a high rating to Amnesia. Why? some of you may ask. Simply because Amnesia is NOT.BAD. Not as bad as people tend to label it. First fact about Amnesia: it's an otome game (dating simulation for girls) adaption, people! Girls are finally getting more fanservice and smexy bishies! The focus on it it's quite new so nobody can and will invest that much into smexy bishie animes for girls as they do invest in smexy girls with big boobs animes for boys! But this did good even with the low capital!IT HAD A STORY! I've seen adaptions that are really bad, with no story, no development, no anything and I recognize it, but Amnesia doesn't deserve a 2 or a 3. The setting is nice! The art is nice and quite original! The music is the best of the season! The characters are a bit sketchy and hard to get through but they're not stereotypes. The heroine is a dead fish with no emotion, yes. But still, the other factors make up for it. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nWith all the time traveling we got last year this comes right at the right time. The story started off with a lot of potential and continued holding on the suspense factor till the last episode. Why are you people complaining about it? Do you like plots where you know everything from the first minute of the first episode? I personally enjoyed making theories about what the hell is happening while drooling over some bishies and have my heart thump because of some sweet, cheesy lines I'd never recognize I like in real life. The explanations we got in the last episode was quite well made and we slowly managed to connect everything piece by piece. The last regression clip to when the heroine first died was nicely made too. It would have been nicer if the heroine seemed more alive. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nAm I the only one that remained astounded by the character design? I was sad the quality seemed to drop sometimes though, like there started to be too many closeups, the characters stopped moving that much and it all went static like in the last episodes and sometimes the guys seemed taller than how they usually are which made me make fun of them quite a lot. Example: Ukyo and the trees in the alleyway, Ikki in the hospital room, Ukyo when laying down. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nGreat! just great! If i could i'd buy the soundtrack. I'm addicted to the ending and opening of this anime. The first time I actually abuse the replay button on my mp4 in a while. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\r\nThey are not stereotypes. They start off as stereotypes but they're not and the most obvious example is Toma for very obvious reasons, obvious reasons that probably paralyzed you in your chair having an amused or surprised \"oh god\" expression on your face. The guys were all characterized pretty beautifully. The only problem is the heroine. And I once again complain about her. She has no will of her own, no actual impressions, average amount of feelings. If I could dress a doll as the heroine and replace her with the doll then you won't even notice the change. She just goes from \"eh\" to \"oh\" and then \"O-O\" and then \"staaaaaaare*. I hated how Orion was removed from almost all the anime. He could have made her a little bit more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\ncounting how Amnesia was the only anime that managed to keep me waiting in anticipation each Monday for the raw version, then Yes I enjoyed it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nIt tried to follow the otome game as much as it could afford. I liked how all characters had their route animated. FINALLY. And all the jumping in time actually had sense so every fangirl had their love love scenes with their favorite guy and everybody's happy. Anyway, I'd like to ask of those who read this review...please don't bash it too hard. Amnesia it's really misunderstood and underrated. Somebody that didn't play the game might find it harder to enjoy it as one that already played it. I also felt disappointed at some scenes, but overall, it is not a failure with no sense at all to deserve a rating from Bad to Horrible and Pathetic. Try looking at the bright parts of it too and not only at the few bad parts.",

            "content": "First of all, if you have strong impressions for this show, then refrain from reading any further. It might save you some time as well as brain cells that may be lost when watching this show. Trust me, time is worth saving.\r\nWell, if I had my say, this series right here known as Amnesia is one anime that I have one HELL of a trouble following. It's not the part related to the story but rather the concept of the entire series. Even behind the scenes, Amnesia is what I see as a title that can easily be forgettable, just like an Amnesia. It's aseries that just doesn't click right and was not enjoyable for me. As a matter of fact, this series is like a beauty without expression. It's a presentation without the delivery. It's a story without intelligence. And to be honest, I didn't like it one damn bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is based off a Japanese visual novel of the same named produced by Idea Factory. The game is considered of the otome genre and thus is targeted towards more of the female audience. As such, the series stars a main female protagonist as she encounters several hot guys that represents a different suit of a card deck. She becomes the center of attention with her bonds involving the other guys in several supposed routes/arcs that proceeds the story.\\n\\n\r\nSo from the very first episode, viewers may ask themselves: What the hell is going on? \\n\\n\r\nI sure did because the story begins with the main character (named Heroine with no real definite name other than what's being addressed by) with no memories. She is about 19 years old and we know almost to none of her backgrounds from the get-go. Well, we do know a few things. She is apparently lost with no memories prior to August. She is unnamed in the series. She apparently has a job at a local bar. She is clueless with little to no knowledge of the world or even herself. And to add to the injury, Heroine is unable to complete a full sentence most of the time! It's hard to take her character with these sort of ideas from the very beginning but the series must be doing something right to attract the fans, right?\\n\\n\r\nWell, perhaps that part comes with the gentlemen of the series~\\n\\n\r\nAmong several of the characters are the bishonens. They are presented as the guys that the Heroine has prior connections with. Each of them represents a different suit symbol such as Shin (Heart), Ikki (Spade), Toma (Diamond), Kent (Clubs), and Ukyo (Joker). All of them are dressed in a flamboyant way with their stylish clothing that can be very appealing to the ladies. Unfortunately though, they don't seem to hold any more meaning to that. The main problem here is the story. Yes, it's based on a game so there would be alternations but I feel like the series is rushed way too fast.\\n\\n\r\nLet's break this down a little and see where it goes. \\n\\n\r\nThe series takes place on August 1, which is in the middle of dog days. Does that hold any sort of significance? Whether it does or not, the series doesn't present itself too well especially after the thrilling ending of the pilot episode. Because immediately  after that, Amnesia shifts to the romance aspect of the series as Heroine seems to be already in relationship with one of the guys. As the episodes progresses, we learn that Heroine in fact has connections with several of the guys \u2013 all romantically in some way. The main problem is though how, when, where, and why? Finally, there's the supernatural part of the story with a curious little (and to add..annoying) pixie named Orion. The show in my opinion reached a new level of annoyance the second he opened his mouth. He is a creature that is only visible by Heroine herself and he seems to be the most mysterious of them all. Maybe he is able to recover Heroine's memories. Maybe he is the one who caused them in the first place. Maybe he knew Heroine prior to her amnesia. Maybe he knows the other guys as well. That's a lot of maybes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself also has problems with being a bit rushed in particular one of my favorites later on. As a matter of fact, each of the main male characters only gets so little to explore their connection with Heroine. Of course, this doesn't come as a major surprise as result of the show's given length. Regardless though, the story comes as a rushed narration and one that lacks flavor. YUCK. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Heroine herself has many problems besides just her amnesia. In fact, she is presented as being foolish, deficient, unintelligent, and literally a BAKA. Her foolishness even puts herself at dangerous situations such as being nearly drowned and falling off a cliff. At first, it looked serious but at many times, it's almost laughable. That and the fact that she can rarely complete a full sentence further enhances such criticism of her weak character. \\n\\n\r\nThe series does bring in some interesting concepts though. In fact, it seems that all the routes will be explored despite their rushed sequences. As such, all the main male characters get their own spotlights with Heroine. The mysterious atmosphere brings a majestic feeling as well with its strange delivery. It makes viewers wants to know what happens next rather and hoping some of their questions will be given answers. That and the fact that the characters' designs are visually appealing can be attractive for the audience. Furthermore, I feel like the seiyu did a terrific job with their voice acting. Even Heroine who can rarely complete a full sentence is portrayed in a direct way to show how real she is that of having an amnesia. All the other male characters' voices fits their personality as well and in general makes some sense.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately though, these factors added together do not justify enjoyment for me in this series. The story is just too unbelievable with too many things going on at once. Some of these things makes little sense such as a group of girls attempting to bully Heroine on a daily basis out of jealousy (?). Among others, there is a mysterious female and another seemingly antagonist who often seems be a thorn to Heroine's quest to regain her memory. Even so, Heroine herself lacks motivation and often relies far too much on her boyfriends. Needless to say (but I'll say it anyways), she is useless. She is considered a joke and not even funny. In fact, this show has no humor and for whatever reason, it tries to force it through its dialogues. Speaking of which, the dialogues all follow a monotone like sequence. They lack flavor or an entertaining style. Hell, I can watch the New York stock exchange for more entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artwork, this series did well. The way the characters are dressed are very appealing and has that majestic feeling. To add to the mix, their eyes are decorated with stylish outlines and a creative touch. It keeps some of the audience interested but at many times, it just looks like a distraction that has little to do with the actual content of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe music/soundtrack is mediocre for the series from my perspective. The OP song, \"Zoetrope\" by Nagi Yanagi is quite catchy as it depicts a montage of the main characters with the male protagonist. However, at many variances, it only seems to be appealing with no merit to any morality. In fact, Amnesia itself has no real value in its story besides a Heroine being a useless girl. Such a pity to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Amnesia is a series I hope I will forget. Well, if it comes to visuals, it caught my attention but beyond that leads to nothing more than a palm in the face. When watching the Heroine, it's almost like telling yourself 'why, just why is she so useless?' That source even puts her own life at danger in various circumstances until her knight in shining armor can save her. And of course, that usually happens in this series anyways. Let's not also forget that annoying pixie by the name of Orion as well with mystery written all over it. I wished this series was good. Honestly, I did but this series dropped the ball. If you do plan on watching it, I do hope you enjoy it. However for me, I just want to forget it...forget it like an Amnesia of no tomorrow.",

            "content": "Amnesia. Oh well, how do i say it. I was actually disappointed with the pilot episode and the next after that. It is an adaptation of an otome game with the same title. I was expecting this anime since it is a reverse harem type and it turns out to be a downer. First the story, it is about a girl who has an amnesia who sees a flying kind of fairy meet demon like boy named Orion who claims to be a spirit from another world who accidentally stumbled upon her spirit that caused him to be trapped in her soul and thus causedthe amnesia. That Orion character was designed like those fairies from shugo chara but more cuter and bishounen type and that's what makes it confusing cause I do not know what the character was trying to pull off.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist herself was not impressive she's boring and her character is so soft spoken that you can't feel any spark of spontaneity or even life out of her character like someone whose very uninterested. She lacks life. She doesn't even seem to panic waking up not having memories and not even knowing her name. On top of that she doesn't even seem to be shocked seeing a floating boy that only she can see and hear. I mean what the hell!? She just goes with the flow and listens to what Orion tells her to do. She's passive and uninteresting like she doesn't have a goal or even a purpose whatsoever. She also kind of collapse in every opportunity she gets. Haha. I mean just because you have an amnesia doesn't mean you have to collapse every freakin time. \\n\\n\r\nThe bishies surrounding her were all but hands down handsome and they all work at a maid/host cafe. They're eyes were designed with two colors which is somehow interesting. The four bishies represents the four suits of cards, the heart, spade, diamond and clover. I thought at first that this is some kind of servant like where the four boys protect the girl with some power since they represent the suits like in hiiro no kakera and fushigi yuugi but turns out the representation of card suits doesn't seem to relate in anyway. I don't know in the future maybe they will, but so far the magic kind of protecting thing is out of the picture. \\n\\n\r\nThe costume designs of the characters were like emo rockstars meet loli like ripped shirts and too many belts, frilly laces and the likes. I know you won't expect much on reverse harem genre but it's not like you can't make it interesting at the very least. The overall setting was kind of gloomy and personally for me depressing. I don't know it just give that sort of vibes. Well as of now it doesn't give me a reason to continue but i'll still try until i reached episode 5 then I'll drop it if it will still be boring as hell. The handsome guys can't compensate the depressed feeling I get afterwards the end of the episode. I'm really hoping against hope that it will turn out okay.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, on the positive side there are kind a lot of \"romantic\" scenes that as a girl you might want boys to do that with you like they like and care for you so much kind of thing. The unexpected kisses and the catching you when you tripped kind of thing. So if you're just into that feel good romantic kind and doesn't care much about the personality of the characters and the story then you might give it a try maybe you'll like it but I suggest you move to other animes that will make your viewing time well spent.",

I like the mystery of the show, and how when the main character learns something, i learn something to.   We get to piece together her life and her situation with her.\r\nArt:  I like the artwork and style of clothing of the characters.  I like the different color choices that the artist uses, i cant help but think the colors deal with the story.  \r\nCharacter:  Some say that the main characteris to boring and inexpressive, but i dont really mind that in this anime.  She doesnt remember who she is or any of the experiences that shaped her personality, so naturally she always seems kind of jaded.  I hope as the story develops more we get to see her develop to.  The bishie characters are also interesting, and im expecting in the future episodes to see them develop.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy the mood and mystery of this anime, thats why i  would rate it an 8 so far.",

            "content": "Amnesia is by far one of the worst anime I've ever watched. \r\nI don't know if I missed something or if I just don't understand reverse harem but this was one of the worst anime I've ever watched. \r\nLet's start with the story. \r\nBasically it's about a girl with no memories who die every fourth episode and restart from August 1 with a new boyfriend. \r\nI guess the story had potential but it didn't even get close to the greatness it could have achieved. \r\nI thought it was going to start up all tangled, which it did, then sort out into a massive mind blow.The only blow I got was an explosion of disappointment because it turned out to be one of the most pathetic love stories I have ever encountered. I would love to go in to detail but since you're not allowed to write spoilers in a review I can not tell my most delicious insults towards this shallow and superficial 3 episode love that goes on between the characters..... Oops! \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow let's move on to the characters shall we? \\n\r\nThe first thing i want to comment on is that the anime does a great job satisfying all the shippers and bringing out the characteristics of the boys by allowing the main character  2 - 3 episodes to get to know them. That way the fan girls can fan girl over their tragic personalities and i can puke on how ridiculously stereotypical they are. \\n\\n\r\nWe have Mr. Braincells who is socially awkward and doesn't understand love.\\n\r\nThe mysterious negative emo with a broken home.\\n\r\nAn extremely energetic big brother type and not to forget \\n\r\nthe disgustingly slimy womanizer who tries to make you feel sorry for him because all the girls fall for him. \\n\\n\r\n(so far this anime still sounds kind of interesting... damn...)\\n\\n\r\nNo offence to those who had a favorite boy. I'd by lying if I said I didn't.  After all I'm a girl and most of us are infected with shipping disease. There has to be a couple right? \\n\\n\r\nOh! there is also a supporting character that is supposed to be helping the main character to get through her amnesia but he pops up for 2 minutes every 4 episodes and gives almost no help at all. Well... maybe he does. He tells her when to talk and run at least because apparently, she doesn't know when to do that. Which brings me to the worst, saddest, most pathetic female lead in the history of anime.  \\n\\n\r\nShe was so pathetic she didn't even deserve a name and there fore, I can not insult her by using her name because she really doesn't have one. \\n\\n\r\nOut of all the important memories you'd want to return, your name should be a priority right? Neither did anyone else bother to use it at any point during these 12 episodes....hmmm... *suspicion rises* \\n\\n\r\nNow let me sum up her personality in three simple words you probably learned in kindergarten and if you ever watch the show, you'll realize how spot on I am: \\n\\n\r\nWalking, talking, rock. \\n\\n\r\nSometimes she wasn't even talking at all. Just making weird little shy girl sounds. That didn't bother me as much as the fact that she couldn't do anything by herself though. She couldn't even think by herself. In a dangerous situation she did nothing unless someone told her what to do. If you ever want to complain about something objectifying women, complain about this. She was just like an object and not more interesting than the hat she is always wearing on her kawaii little head. \\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the art style.\\n\r\nI did not love the art style since I'm not particularly fond of hair sticking out of their heads like spiky antennas or the weird three colored eyes that makes it look like they are constantly sleepy or bored but after a while it became oddly satisfying and I started to realize the slight charm hidden behind those weird goth clothes. \\n\\n\r\nI can not comment on the soundtrack very much since it wasn't very memorable and the opening and ending didn't really interest me so i can't comment on those either since I always skipped. \\n\\n\r\nSo to end my positive review: \\n\r\nThis anime wasn't as good as it could have been since it had a weak story line and a bad ending not to mention the superficial bonds that were created between the boring, spine less characters that couldn't convince me one bit when they confessed their love all over the place. They couldn't even manage to carry out the one thing the whole anime was about (giving her her memories back)\\n\r\nThe art style was peculiar but oddly satisfying while the soundtrack wasn't memorable at all. It was bad from episode 1 and it was a drag getting through the episodes although they were only 12. \\n\r\nThe ending was a twist but it was not believable enough to even deserve a reference and if you like this anime and think I'm wrong and made a bigger mistake than Microsoft Office when they gave birth to Clippy, I am not sorry, i just didn't like this anime. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so I finally just finished Amnesia.  In my attempt to watch every episode I awaited for each episode of her confusion for me to be a little less confused.  I tried to make sense of what was going on and where they were going to go with the story, and then I saw the end.  I was actually disappointed that I had wasted my time watching it.  \r\nStory:  You can't really explain much of the story without ruining the horrible \"mystery\" I suppose.  Heroine has amnesia, who knew right...in which every episode is her trying to figure outwhat's going on, and who she's with.  Yes, it's a reverse harem.  The story to me was awful.  They could have put a lot more effort into creating more drama and mystery, but you were left more with a scratching your head in a bad way wondering what's going on rather than a cognitively stimulated way.  And then the end came. Then the end came and I felt like it dragged on forever.  I sat literally wondering, \"When is this going to be over, and are they going to actually do something.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art isn't bad, it's colorful, and bright.  However, the characters eyes are left with you wondering if they have some \"special\" power...but maybe that's just the style they used.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters in this story were terrible.  I felt like some were randomly thrown in and the connections they had to the MC were completely irrelevant or stupid.  A lot of the characters had no back story, especially the Heroine, the one you probably could have used a little bit of a back story on.  You don't get much however.  Their interaction with each other is unnatural and odd.  The characters in this series disappointed me greatly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  I didn't really do enjoyment because I don't feel like I enjoyed much of this anime at all.  I can say if you want an anime with sustenance do not watch this anime.  If you want an anime with a good mystery that leaves you wanting more, this isn't it.  If you want a dull and boring anime that has bright and pretty colorful characters you can stare at that really don't mean anything, then this anime is for you!  My overall experience of this anime is poor.  I was hoping by some means they would thrill me somehow with the end, and really come out with some amazing plot twist or something...but that didn't happen for me.",

            "content": "Amnesia: I Wish I Had It After This\r\nActually, you know what, I'm pretty sure I'll be contracting amnesia when it comes to this series because it is one of the more forgettable pieces of work I've seen so far this year. It was incredibly underwhelming. It's sad to see Brains Base put out such a terrible piece of work, especially considering how well they've done with series' like Natsume Yuujinchou, Baccano, Spice+Wolf and Durarara. This series doesn't even come close to capturing the same magic as those series. So where did this series go astray? Honestly, it fails when it comes to its plot andits characters. \\n\\n\r\nAmnesia is about a girl who wakes up on August 1st only to find out that she has amnesia (go figure) and doesn't remember anything prior to the date she awakened. As soon as she wakes up, she discovers she can see a strange, fairy-like being known as Orion that no one else can see, as Orion tries to assist this girl in trying to recover her memories. As the series progresses, the protagonist continues to get into accidents only to awaken on August 1st all over again, except she seems to awaken in an alternate dimension where her relationships are slightly different.\\n\\n\r\nThis series was painful to watch for many reasons. The first being the characters are downright terrible. The protagonist isn't even given a name throughout the series. I'm assuming the biggest reason is due to Amnesia being an adaptation to a visual novel where you program your own desired name. Having a nameless protagonist works fine in a visual novel...but not an anime. The protagonist felt detracted from the rest of the characters because she had no name or at least wasn't referred to by name. It's just hard to get invested in a nameless character. The least Brains Base could've done was give her a name. Can you imagine if Aniplex didn't name the lead protagonist in the Persona 4: The Animation? It would be so much harder to get invested in \"Yuu Narukami's\" character because it would be detracting that the other characters won't refer to him by name. At any rate, to get back on topic, that's still no excuse for the rest of the characters. Besides Ukyou, all of the characters felt bland as cardboard and that might be an insult to cardboard. All of her potential love interests were either uninteresting or just had unappealing personality quirks. Still, as much as I disliked all of the characters, the protagonist ground my gears the most. While I realize she had amnesia and that can throw off how you would normally act, her thoughts and actions were completely illogical. Her methods of trying to get her memories back were extremely round-a-bout and it seemed like whenever she decided on doing something, I smacked my forehead out of frustration and screamed \"idiot!\" at my computer screen. The protagonist was a weak character with almost no redeemable qualities whatsoever. She acted illogically, she had zero personality, and the series provided very little motivation to her character whatsoever. I haven't seen a lead female protagonist in an anime this bad since watching Felicita in Arcana Famiglia. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot and story was abysmal. I will admit that this series did have a nice mystery element at first. It was really the only reason why I even kept watching because I was intrigued as to why she would continue to wake up on August 1st and I was intrigued as to why she kept ending up in different dimensions. However, the payoff was far from satisfactory and I felt duped by the time it was all said and done. The explanations that were given to us in the end were baffling at best and all-in-all, I was still left with more questions than answers. On top of that, I found this series to be riddled with cliches and the scriptwriting to be downright piss poor. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is sadly one of the better aspects of this series and even then, I wouldn't call it \"good.\" From a technical standpoint, the animation isn't bad. I just found the character designs to be dreadful. Overall, I just couldn't get past how ridiculous the character and costume designs were for each character. While I am aware that the series was trying to implement a \"playing card\" atmosphere for each character, how they were designed was off-putting and somewhat corny. One of the more off-putting aspects of it was how the characters never changed clothes. They continuously looked and dressed the same throughout the entire thing. The ONLY costume change I can recall is the lead protagonist in her normal everyday clothes and her night gown. That's it. Again, much like the character name, that is something that might work in a visual novel, but not an anime. \\n\\n\r\nI will say ONE good thing about Amnesia. It did have some really good music composition. This was Yoshiaki Dewa's first series in regards to music direction and I must say, he did a remarkably good job. The theme songs by Yagi Yanagi and Ray were both really well done and they were the few bright spots I can say about this series. \\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, I have only a few words to share for Yoshimitsu Ohashi (Director) and Brains Base. This was terrible. This was an absolutely terrible attempt at adapting a visual novel that probably would've been difficult to adapt in the first place. They committed several cardinal sins in the adaptation process and some of which are downright unforgivable. The best way I can describe it on the whole is lazy. This series was lazily written and lazily produced. It didn't try to tell a compelling story. It didn't try to create an engaging romance between the protagonists and the love interests. It didn't try in almost every aspect of anime production. I cannot recommend this series to anyone and I can assure you this is probably going to end up on my Worst Animes of 2013 list. If there was ever an example of how to NOT adapt a visual novel to anime, Amnesia is probably the best example I can think of.",

It's pretty clich\u00e9 shoujo atmosphere but at least that's not everything and there are many open questions which make you want to know more about the circumstances. \r\nAnd I kind of enjoy Shin's dominat temper towards her. ;) Furthermore, I'm curious about the attitude of the other male characters when theybecome a part of her life in this time leaping world. ;)\\n\\n\r\n--- status: 3/12 episodes | Overall rating: 5\\n\r\nAmnesia reminds me of Neo Angelique Abyss and Kimi ga Nozomu Eien: \\n\r\nThe heroine is mentally absent, puzzled, confused, obedient, submissive, has a lack of own opinions, no temper and is boring. There's nor charm nor allurement. There's a supporting character (in Kimi: the sister | in Amnesia: the ghost) who is kind of annoying. In Angelique and Amnesia you can find many pretty boys but this cannot replace any content. \\n\\n\r\nAt least there's a ray of hope and that's why I think this series might get interesting. Her boyfriend, Shin, says the heroine's personality is different from before. Usually, she'd get angry if he kissed her or become upset when he did this and that - but this usual reaction was missing and he remarked it. So maybe she had a personality and is on her way to get it back? \\n\\n\r\nAlso some characters might get interesting and that's why I'll watch it for a while. There still might be some potential but I don't expect much of it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the art is really beautiful and the character's two-colored eyes are pretty creative.",

Romance them all and find out whom you like the most! And die once in a while. Literally.\r\nThe music is bland and forgettable, but I liked the opening and ending. \r\nIf you like facepalming yourself few times per minute while watching some poorly animated, wanna-be-deep-and-mysterious anime, this isthe thing you're looking for. Great for watching with friends! Just bring gallons of alcohol and make shots every time our nameless heroine says \"eeh\". Have fun, I certainly do!",

            "content": "Story: 5/10\r\n- Given that the anime made the viewer (that is me) wanting to keep watching until the mystery unraveled.\r\nThis anime brings a lot of emphasis into the protagonist of the story, who is a lost girl with no memories of herself at all. In the anime, she produces a scarce personality where the guy characters could do ALMOST anything to her without a  fight. She does not feel any specific emotions throughout the story and she lacks character. She would react with a character the same way with another because of this lack of personality. Although she has amnesia, this lost attitude iswhat made the other characters seem more important than the 'Heroine'.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was amazing. The eyes of the characters were colourful and brought a lot of life into them. The male characters were given a slim overall body shape and the main female character was given a (I guess) an average look.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the specific ending's music box melody, the ending theme, the opening theme. The music box melody gave a lot of feelings and emotions in the anime. As for the opening and ending theme, they were produced very well that was quite catchy for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I did not like the Heroine's personality, I liked her innocent and caring self. It sometimes made me think that it's too unreal to be true, even with amnesia. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the male characters, I did not like most of them due to their assertiveness throughout the story (except for one). However, I like the uniqueness of each of the male characters and how each of them are valued differently by the Heroine.\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed when the Heroine is able to develop through the story. She produces a more distinct self as the anime goes on. I also enjoyed how she reacts with the various male characters in the plot. However, the ending seemed rushed, where most of the mystery unravels at the end of episode 11. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\n- I would recommend this to viewers who likes mystery in a way; however, make sure to not be too surprised at the end of the anime.\\n",

This kept me watching the new episode as soon as it was available and subbed. Although many will watch reverse harem's for the romance that is in them i think this story is good for it's mystery aspect instead. The thing that let the story down i found was that it wasn't long enough which didn't give it long enough to develop themystery\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was the first thing that made me want to watch it. The art in this anime is very pretty and detailed. It the effects of the shadows and sudden colour were very good for setting the mood.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime was nice and simple although it didn't particially stand out to me other than the opening and ending which i never skipped. But it was very nice so i think it deserves an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nSome of the characters were very interesting and unexpected however other character's were very predictable and stereotypical. If it were only some side character's that were predictable it would have been good but instead the main character was one of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nDespite the flaws in this anime i thoroughly enjoyed this anime and am waiting for the game to be translated into english so that i can find out more of the mystery. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nOverall this anime wasn't perfect but if your looking for an anime with some mystery, some romance and Amazing art i recommend Amnesia.",

Amnesia is a series full of mystery and internal struggle on the canvas of alternative world traveling,all while adding a drop of romance to finish the cocktail. It begs its viewers to do some detective job in order to understand it, I know this because I had a hard time at first putting all the  facts together or you can say I'm somewhat of a dummy.\r\nHere is a personal opinion that I assume nobody gives a damn about:\r\nGreat story, very intriguingart concept for both background and characters. Epic OST's (some of the best I've heard). Also characters are totally different from one another except they have this air of coolness about them.\\n\r\nGeneral opinion\\n\r\nA very dramatic piece of art that shows how much someone can do to accomplish a wish out of love.\\n\r\nHope you like it... and if you don't,well, bummer.",

            "content": "First of all, I can't understand why people give this Anime a bad review after watching 1-3 episodes. A lot of people mentioned the reason they dropped it is the story line being too confusing to understand. Now, if you would read the synopsis of this anime, you could guess that it won't be easy to understand, especially since it's not fully aired. Just because you can't comprehend, it doesn't mean the story is bad. A lot of animes start off weird and slowly explain what's going on. No one can expect to fully understand what is happening in Amnesia after 6 Episodes.  I'lltry to keep spoilers as low as possible here. \\n\\n\r\nNow to the review itself, what actually got me drawn to this Anime was the (for me) outstanding and appealing art style. It is obviously a Shoujo-Anime so the target audience is mainly female. I've seen a lot of people describing the main character, Heroine, as dull, boring, quiet and a bit silly. I think she is a cute and kind character and it is pretty obvious, that after losing all her memories, not knowing who she is, where she is and what her relationships with any of the people she meets are, she is just being cautious and doesn't know how to interact properly. Especially in the following episodes where she is waking up in a new world (always on the 1st of August) with mixed up memories and relationships again (mostly without Orion's guidance) she gets confused. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I'm not too judgmental of it yet since I've watched a lot of Animes that start explaining what's happening in the last few episodes. \\n\r\nOf course after watching 6 episodes so far you can guess that it has a lot to do with Ukyo (the green haired dude who is friendly to her but seems a bit vicious when he's alone) and my guess is that before she's being sent  to another world, she always dies in the previous one (various incidents that could cause death'). This is merely an assumption though.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, can't wait for the next episodes! Absolutely love the idea so far, will see what they make of it.",

The story itself sounded intriguing, but as I continued through the episodes I found myself wondering how each one will match up to the description which I read. It did however match up to its main genre, a reverseharem which is one positive thing about this anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was one of the main reasons I decided to finish this anime, the art was not brilliant, but I enjoyed the card theme which was displayed throughout the anime and I have to admit, the outfits were somewhat amazing. Other than that the manner in which the characters themselves, excluding the outfits, were somewhat normal, but all in all the art did give this anime some form of value.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the art the sound, especially the opening song, did do their job somewhat well and I was impressed by the effort they placed within the music. I have to say the sound of the anime usually makes or breaks it for me and what can I say, even though this anime fell under the genre I would usually avoid, it did have great sound sound quality. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was, well, extremely poorly done. There was little if none character development and the main character just made me frown. She was barely spoke and never really truly developed. If it had not been for the great music and the intriguing art theme I would not have been able to finish this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI did not at all enjoy this anime, but it had a few humors moments which made it somewhat enjoyable.

Well the show is not at all poor in any sense.\r\nWriting this review after watching 7 eps. and I have to say, I totally look forward to this show every week. In fact its hard to wait for a week actually to see what's gonna happen next.\r\nStory [10/10]: I loved the concept of the show- A girl, who, every time she experiences some kind of shock wakes up, finds her surroundings changed. How she and the people around her respond to it is the essence of the story till now. I loved thedirection of this show. The scenes change at a very good pace which keeps the mystery alive in each episode. And especially the last scene cut at the end of Ep. 7. It was so subtle!\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation [10/10]: Full marks here as well :) The characters are all gorgeous and the backgrounds are well suited to all the scenes. Animation is top notch for me as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound [8/10]: The OP and ED are both very groovy. The background music isn't too much noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [8/10]: I loved the way the girls character was handled. Her responses to all the things she experiences was very well crafted. As for the guys they are not bad. All are suspicious looking at the beginning but you get a flavor of their personalities with each episode. When the protagonist is in a particular world with one guy, the others dont even appear anywhere. This can be both a positive or a negative point - The former -> since it helps in highlighting the incidents of a particular world where one of them is the girl's partner. The latter -> Since the creators of the show could have added many situation in which such interactions of the girl would be complicated by including the other characters influence to the flow of events. But again I am satisfied fully with watching what I am shown :)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall [9/10]: I am enjoying every bit of this show. Its got all the right amount of mystery to it And the pace of the show is good as well. So completely recommended to watch *thumbs up*",

            "content": "Are you a lonely, boy-less teenage girl? Do you wish you could have many hot guys surrounded by you, astounded by you for no real reason? What about living in a world where you get to date and be submissive to no, not just one attractive male, but over FOUR of them in many different worlds? Does that sound like the dream life to you? Have no fear, \"Amnesia\" is just what you need to fulfill this!\r\nIn case you don't get the vibe, this is pretty much a reverse harem used primarily for female wish-fulfillment. The story centers around our lead girl, erm, I guesswe just call her Heroine? Because her boyfriends that love her oh so dearly never bother to call her by her name? Yeah. Heroine finds herself awakening with no memories, and it's up to her and a spirit called Orion to collect her memories. She's also trapped in this sort of \"time loop.\" Basically, each time she dies, the date resets. By date I mean both the month and day and her current boyfriend.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has two main issues: the pacing and the Heroine. The pacing moves by pretttty damn slowly, to the point where even when we hit episode nine, nearly nothing is known about the main plot or what exactly is going on. The story is supposedly about the Heroine collecting her memories, but uh.. that's probably the least she's done throughout the show. And that's saying a lot, because she hardly does ANYTHING.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here comes our other issue, the Heroine herself. This girl is so bland, so personality-less, and used as such a wish-fullfillment device that she doesn't even have a name. Isn't that awesome, girls? You don't even have to get depressed when hot guy #1 doesn't call out your name! It makes self-insertion much, much easier. Heroine is a story-dragger -- she provides little to no advancement to the plot herself and has to rely on everyone else to push her in any direction possible. Oh yeah, having amnesia ain't excuse for not having a personality. Fucking Nyuu from Elfen Lied had more of a personality then her, and she couldn't even dress herself. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Heroine's reliance, this also brings another issue: she's submissive. Too, too submissive. Almost all the guys do extremely improper things to her, like shoving her against a tree in the middle of the dark against her will or forcefully kissing her, getting too close to her, anything. And she just accepts all of this. She never sticks up for herself, and is even willing to stay with a man whom she pretty much knows will dump her when his time limit is up. Great example, right guys? The male characters ain't any better -- they're all pretty much just a bunch of hot dude's lusting after Heroine for their own fucked up reasons. Some want to play her, others want to lock her up in a cage. You know how it is.\\n\\n\r\nOh uh, the positives? Well, the art is pretty crisp, as expected of Brain's Base. The eyes look downright gorgeous and the opening theme is pretty much eyecandy. The men are attractive, which is a key for these anime, and the backgrounds are well-created. Soundtrack is merely mediocre and unmemorable, though bonus points are awarded for such an awesome opening song. I'm convinced to hear more of Nagi Yanagi's stuff. \\n\\n\r\nSo, enjoyment? I'm sorry, but I'm not the type of person that gets wet from putting myself in the shoes of a nobody and letting all these hot guys date and rape me. If you're the type that's into that, then I'm sure your enjoyment of this will be much, much higher then mine. \\n\\n\r\nNow I will ask you this again -- are you a lonely and angsty teenage girl? Do you dream of many a men surrounding you, kissing you, pinning you behind alley's, and drugging you? Do you want to live in this life? If so, then look no further, my dears. This anime is perfect for you. You got a bunch of hot guys that want your tits and a girl who's so bland that you can insert my chihuahua in it and it would probably make the story more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIf not, just don't watch this. There is literally nothing to be lost and nothing to gain, except time and knowledge on how not to write a shoujo. \\n",

            "content": "Ugh. This show. I wanted to like it so hard. But I ended up wanting to break my tv around episode 3 instead. \r\nStory: The pilot episode pulled me in right away. Girl has amnesia due to an accident with a spirit named Orion and can't tell anyone, but has to learn about her past somehow. Several interesting things happen in the first episode. But it gets awful from there. \r\nI get that this is based on an input based otome or reverse harem game. But the main character is SO uninteresting, boring, and just plain dull! I can't figure out why the male charactersare all so interested in her! She has a few responses to everything: (1) Staring in confusion (eyebrows up in concern), (2) Responding in a whispery \"hai\", (3) Saying \"uh, I, uh...\" and just letting the silence stretch to fill time I guess, and (4) running away or rejection. She rarely asks questions about her situation and the only thing she does to try to improve her situation is writing in a journal. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Oh so ugly! If I were the \"heroine\" (and I say that sarcastically since it seems like she'd just die if the boys weren't around to constantly save her from just about everything), I'd reject them all just based on their fashion sense! \\n\r\nIkki: In purple and black. Wears not only a hairclip but makeup too. \\n\r\nShin: In red and black. Clothes are raggedy and tight AND mismatched. Has one red and one black thigh high, lace up boot. And apparently vampire bites on his chest.\\n\r\nToma: In yellow and black. Headbands. Really? And kind of a checkered, piratey skirt sash thing going on. \\n\r\nKent: In green and black. Dresses like he's cosplaying an emo Vash the Stampede. \\n\r\nThen there's our main character: She wears these red and black plaid tights with a SEA FOAM GREEN dress, tunic thing. Ok, her hair is cute but they ruined that too (read on).\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention the weird style of coloring their eyes? I felt like between the wacky outfits and eyes that I was in some 70s trip. Either that or the creators were TRYING to get rid of some viewers through the shear ugliness of the design. \\n\\n\r\nOne more thing on character design. The main char gets her hair chopped off so dramatically in the first episode that she passes out. Yet when she goes to lament her new style in the mirror it's completely the same. Given the time skipping, I thought this would have made a great way for her to keep track of where she was, what day it was, etc. But no. They gave a cop out and didn't change her design in the slightest. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The main character (whose name we never learn) is just horrendous. I've already talked about that. The male characters are extremely cliche. There's the emo bad boy, the overly intelligent and socially awkward one, the fun childhood friend, and the playa that all the girls love. \\n\\n\r\nThe boys all carry the story. It's completely up to them. What kills me is that they all notice something is slightly different about the main char, but don't really care or do anything about it. If she was like that before the accident, wow. How the heck did she get so many guys (not to mention her gal pals) interested in her?\\n\\n\r\nHere is an exchange from episode 6: \\n\r\nGirl: (Looks down, looks up in surprise as Ikki goes to stand in front of her.) \\n\r\nIkki: You're not staying over?\\n\r\nGirl: (Looks surprised. You can tell because she gasps.) Um, I...Um... (silence drags)\\n\r\nIkki: It's all right. I'm not hungry like the wolf. I can sleep on the floor. I wont' do anything you don't want me to. It's up to you whether or not you believe me though. \\n\r\nGirl: I, uh... (silence drags)\\n\r\nIkki: What's that face for? (at this point she's just staring at him, completely normal face for her)\\n\r\nGirl: (Staring, silence drags)\\n\r\nIkki: (Staring) (Laughs) Oh come on, you don't have to look so frantic. \\n\\n\r\nWTF? When did she look frantic? These guys are completely carrying the story and imagining things that aren't happening. I find it hard to see this as an anime and not the game it was based on because the main char might as well not even be there. I'm so frustrated with it. I've just completed episode 8 and I'm dropping it from here. First review I've written without finishing a show but I really don't see it getting better. \\n\\n\r\nPlease don't waste your time!",

            "content": "EDIT2016: Please take into consideration that this was written 3 years ago and the things I've written here are quite biased from an otome game fan side. It was meant to be taken as a defense to the reverse harem genre as a whole which was a lot less popular during the time I wrote this than it is now. I must mention that I changed a lot of opinions during the past three years, I've started to want to give more objective opinions, even if sometimes, it's, of course, unavoidable to not be biased; that doesn't mean that I'm discrediting this review. I amstill convinced that Amnesia is NOT the worst reverse anime and most definitely NOT bad, but take mostly the first part with a grain of salt. I'm keeping this review up to note down my own personal growth. Have a nice day!\\n\\n\r\n======\\n\\n\r\nI'm one of those people that gave a high rating to Amnesia. Why? some of you may ask. Simply because Amnesia is NOT.BAD. Not as bad as people tend to label it. First fact about Amnesia: it's an otome game (dating simulation for girls) adaption, people! Girls are finally getting more fanservice and smexy bishies! The focus on it it's quite new so nobody can and will invest that much into smexy bishie animes for girls as they do invest in smexy girls with big boobs animes for boys! But this did good even with the low capital!IT HAD A STORY! I've seen adaptions that are really bad, with no story, no development, no anything and I recognize it, but Amnesia doesn't deserve a 2 or a 3. The setting is nice! The art is nice and quite original! The music is the best of the season! The characters are a bit sketchy and hard to get through but they're not stereotypes. The heroine is a dead fish with no emotion, yes. But still, the other factors make up for it. \\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nWith all the time traveling we got last year this comes right at the right time. The story started off with a lot of potential and continued holding on the suspense factor till the last episode. Why are you people complaining about it? Do you like plots where you know everything from the first minute of the first episode? I personally enjoyed making theories about what the hell is happening while drooling over some bishies and have my heart thump because of some sweet, cheesy lines I'd never recognize I like in real life. The explanations we got in the last episode was quite well made and we slowly managed to connect everything piece by piece. The last regression clip to when the heroine first died was nicely made too. It would have been nicer if the heroine seemed more alive. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nAm I the only one that remained astounded by the character design? I was sad the quality seemed to drop sometimes though, like there started to be too many closeups, the characters stopped moving that much and it all went static like in the last episodes and sometimes the guys seemed taller than how they usually are which made me make fun of them quite a lot. Example: Ukyo and the trees in the alleyway, Ikki in the hospital room, Ukyo when laying down. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nGreat! just great! If i could i'd buy the soundtrack. I'm addicted to the ending and opening of this anime. The first time I actually abuse the replay button on my mp4 in a while. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\r\nThey are not stereotypes. They start off as stereotypes but they're not and the most obvious example is Toma for very obvious reasons, obvious reasons that probably paralyzed you in your chair having an amused or surprised \"oh god\" expression on your face. The guys were all characterized pretty beautifully. The only problem is the heroine. And I once again complain about her. She has no will of her own, no actual impressions, average amount of feelings. If I could dress a doll as the heroine and replace her with the doll then you won't even notice the change. She just goes from \"eh\" to \"oh\" and then \"O-O\" and then \"staaaaaaare*. I hated how Orion was removed from almost all the anime. He could have made her a little bit more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\ncounting how Amnesia was the only anime that managed to keep me waiting in anticipation each Monday for the raw version, then Yes I enjoyed it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nIt tried to follow the otome game as much as it could afford. I liked how all characters had their route animated. FINALLY. And all the jumping in time actually had sense so every fangirl had their love love scenes with their favorite guy and everybody's happy. Anyway, I'd like to ask of those who read this review...please don't bash it too hard. Amnesia it's really misunderstood and underrated. Somebody that didn't play the game might find it harder to enjoy it as one that already played it. I also felt disappointed at some scenes, but overall, it is not a failure with no sense at all to deserve a rating from Bad to Horrible and Pathetic. Try looking at the bright parts of it too and not only at the few bad parts.",

            "content": "First of all, if you have strong impressions for this show, then refrain from reading any further. It might save you some time as well as brain cells that may be lost when watching this show. Trust me, time is worth saving.\r\nWell, if I had my say, this series right here known as Amnesia is one anime that I have one HELL of a trouble following. It's not the part related to the story but rather the concept of the entire series. Even behind the scenes, Amnesia is what I see as a title that can easily be forgettable, just like an Amnesia. It's aseries that just doesn't click right and was not enjoyable for me. As a matter of fact, this series is like a beauty without expression. It's a presentation without the delivery. It's a story without intelligence. And to be honest, I didn't like it one damn bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is based off a Japanese visual novel of the same named produced by Idea Factory. The game is considered of the otome genre and thus is targeted towards more of the female audience. As such, the series stars a main female protagonist as she encounters several hot guys that represents a different suit of a card deck. She becomes the center of attention with her bonds involving the other guys in several supposed routes/arcs that proceeds the story.\\n\\n\r\nSo from the very first episode, viewers may ask themselves: What the hell is going on? \\n\\n\r\nI sure did because the story begins with the main character (named Heroine with no real definite name other than what's being addressed by) with no memories. She is about 19 years old and we know almost to none of her backgrounds from the get-go. Well, we do know a few things. She is apparently lost with no memories prior to August. She is unnamed in the series. She apparently has a job at a local bar. She is clueless with little to no knowledge of the world or even herself. And to add to the injury, Heroine is unable to complete a full sentence most of the time! It's hard to take her character with these sort of ideas from the very beginning but the series must be doing something right to attract the fans, right?\\n\\n\r\nWell, perhaps that part comes with the gentlemen of the series~\\n\\n\r\nAmong several of the characters are the bishonens. They are presented as the guys that the Heroine has prior connections with. Each of them represents a different suit symbol such as Shin (Heart), Ikki (Spade), Toma (Diamond), Kent (Clubs), and Ukyo (Joker). All of them are dressed in a flamboyant way with their stylish clothing that can be very appealing to the ladies. Unfortunately though, they don't seem to hold any more meaning to that. The main problem here is the story. Yes, it's based on a game so there would be alternations but I feel like the series is rushed way too fast.\\n\\n\r\nLet's break this down a little and see where it goes. \\n\\n\r\nThe series takes place on August 1, which is in the middle of dog days. Does that hold any sort of significance? Whether it does or not, the series doesn't present itself too well especially after the thrilling ending of the pilot episode. Because immediately  after that, Amnesia shifts to the romance aspect of the series as Heroine seems to be already in relationship with one of the guys. As the episodes progresses, we learn that Heroine in fact has connections with several of the guys \u2013 all romantically in some way. The main problem is though how, when, where, and why? Finally, there's the supernatural part of the story with a curious little (and to add..annoying) pixie named Orion. The show in my opinion reached a new level of annoyance the second he opened his mouth. He is a creature that is only visible by Heroine herself and he seems to be the most mysterious of them all. Maybe he is able to recover Heroine's memories. Maybe he is the one who caused them in the first place. Maybe he knew Heroine prior to her amnesia. Maybe he knows the other guys as well. That's a lot of maybes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself also has problems with being a bit rushed in particular one of my favorites later on. As a matter of fact, each of the main male characters only gets so little to explore their connection with Heroine. Of course, this doesn't come as a major surprise as result of the show's given length. Regardless though, the story comes as a rushed narration and one that lacks flavor. YUCK. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Heroine herself has many problems besides just her amnesia. In fact, she is presented as being foolish, deficient, unintelligent, and literally a BAKA. Her foolishness even puts herself at dangerous situations such as being nearly drowned and falling off a cliff. At first, it looked serious but at many times, it's almost laughable. That and the fact that she can rarely complete a full sentence further enhances such criticism of her weak character. \\n\\n\r\nThe series does bring in some interesting concepts though. In fact, it seems that all the routes will be explored despite their rushed sequences. As such, all the main male characters get their own spotlights with Heroine. The mysterious atmosphere brings a majestic feeling as well with its strange delivery. It makes viewers wants to know what happens next rather and hoping some of their questions will be given answers. That and the fact that the characters' designs are visually appealing can be attractive for the audience. Furthermore, I feel like the seiyu did a terrific job with their voice acting. Even Heroine who can rarely complete a full sentence is portrayed in a direct way to show how real she is that of having an amnesia. All the other male characters' voices fits their personality as well and in general makes some sense.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately though, these factors added together do not justify enjoyment for me in this series. The story is just too unbelievable with too many things going on at once. Some of these things makes little sense such as a group of girls attempting to bully Heroine on a daily basis out of jealousy (?). Among others, there is a mysterious female and another seemingly antagonist who often seems be a thorn to Heroine's quest to regain her memory. Even so, Heroine herself lacks motivation and often relies far too much on her boyfriends. Needless to say (but I'll say it anyways), she is useless. She is considered a joke and not even funny. In fact, this show has no humor and for whatever reason, it tries to force it through its dialogues. Speaking of which, the dialogues all follow a monotone like sequence. They lack flavor or an entertaining style. Hell, I can watch the New York stock exchange for more entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of artwork, this series did well. The way the characters are dressed are very appealing and has that majestic feeling. To add to the mix, their eyes are decorated with stylish outlines and a creative touch. It keeps some of the audience interested but at many times, it just looks like a distraction that has little to do with the actual content of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe music/soundtrack is mediocre for the series from my perspective. The OP song, \"Zoetrope\" by Nagi Yanagi is quite catchy as it depicts a montage of the main characters with the male protagonist. However, at many variances, it only seems to be appealing with no merit to any morality. In fact, Amnesia itself has no real value in its story besides a Heroine being a useless girl. Such a pity to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Amnesia is a series I hope I will forget. Well, if it comes to visuals, it caught my attention but beyond that leads to nothing more than a palm in the face. When watching the Heroine, it's almost like telling yourself 'why, just why is she so useless?' That source even puts her own life at danger in various circumstances until her knight in shining armor can save her. And of course, that usually happens in this series anyways. Let's not also forget that annoying pixie by the name of Orion as well with mystery written all over it. I wished this series was good. Honestly, I did but this series dropped the ball. If you do plan on watching it, I do hope you enjoy it. However for me, I just want to forget it...forget it like an Amnesia of no tomorrow.",

            "content": "Amnesia. Oh well, how do i say it. I was actually disappointed with the pilot episode and the next after that. It is an adaptation of an otome game with the same title. I was expecting this anime since it is a reverse harem type and it turns out to be a downer. First the story, it is about a girl who has an amnesia who sees a flying kind of fairy meet demon like boy named Orion who claims to be a spirit from another world who accidentally stumbled upon her spirit that caused him to be trapped in her soul and thus causedthe amnesia. That Orion character was designed like those fairies from shugo chara but more cuter and bishounen type and that's what makes it confusing cause I do not know what the character was trying to pull off.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist herself was not impressive she's boring and her character is so soft spoken that you can't feel any spark of spontaneity or even life out of her character like someone whose very uninterested. She lacks life. She doesn't even seem to panic waking up not having memories and not even knowing her name. On top of that she doesn't even seem to be shocked seeing a floating boy that only she can see and hear. I mean what the hell!? She just goes with the flow and listens to what Orion tells her to do. She's passive and uninteresting like she doesn't have a goal or even a purpose whatsoever. She also kind of collapse in every opportunity she gets. Haha. I mean just because you have an amnesia doesn't mean you have to collapse every freakin time. \\n\\n\r\nThe bishies surrounding her were all but hands down handsome and they all work at a maid/host cafe. They're eyes were designed with two colors which is somehow interesting. The four bishies represents the four suits of cards, the heart, spade, diamond and clover. I thought at first that this is some kind of servant like where the four boys protect the girl with some power since they represent the suits like in hiiro no kakera and fushigi yuugi but turns out the representation of card suits doesn't seem to relate in anyway. I don't know in the future maybe they will, but so far the magic kind of protecting thing is out of the picture. \\n\\n\r\nThe costume designs of the characters were like emo rockstars meet loli like ripped shirts and too many belts, frilly laces and the likes. I know you won't expect much on reverse harem genre but it's not like you can't make it interesting at the very least. The overall setting was kind of gloomy and personally for me depressing. I don't know it just give that sort of vibes. Well as of now it doesn't give me a reason to continue but i'll still try until i reached episode 5 then I'll drop it if it will still be boring as hell. The handsome guys can't compensate the depressed feeling I get afterwards the end of the episode. I'm really hoping against hope that it will turn out okay.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, on the positive side there are kind a lot of \"romantic\" scenes that as a girl you might want boys to do that with you like they like and care for you so much kind of thing. The unexpected kisses and the catching you when you tripped kind of thing. So if you're just into that feel good romantic kind and doesn't care much about the personality of the characters and the story then you might give it a try maybe you'll like it but I suggest you move to other animes that will make your viewing time well spent.",

I like the mystery of the show, and how when the main character learns something, i learn something to.   We get to piece together her life and her situation with her.\r\nArt:  I like the artwork and style of clothing of the characters.  I like the different color choices that the artist uses, i cant help but think the colors deal with the story.  \r\nCharacter:  Some say that the main characteris to boring and inexpressive, but i dont really mind that in this anime.  She doesnt remember who she is or any of the experiences that shaped her personality, so naturally she always seems kind of jaded.  I hope as the story develops more we get to see her develop to.  The bishie characters are also interesting, and im expecting in the future episodes to see them develop.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy the mood and mystery of this anime, thats why i  would rate it an 8 so far.",

            "content": "Amnesia is by far one of the worst anime I've ever watched. \r\nI don't know if I missed something or if I just don't understand reverse harem but this was one of the worst anime I've ever watched. \r\nLet's start with the story. \r\nBasically it's about a girl with no memories who die every fourth episode and restart from August 1 with a new boyfriend. \r\nI guess the story had potential but it didn't even get close to the greatness it could have achieved. \r\nI thought it was going to start up all tangled, which it did, then sort out into a massive mind blow.The only blow I got was an explosion of disappointment because it turned out to be one of the most pathetic love stories I have ever encountered. I would love to go in to detail but since you're not allowed to write spoilers in a review I can not tell my most delicious insults towards this shallow and superficial 3 episode love that goes on between the characters..... Oops! \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow let's move on to the characters shall we? \\n\r\nThe first thing i want to comment on is that the anime does a great job satisfying all the shippers and bringing out the characteristics of the boys by allowing the main character  2 - 3 episodes to get to know them. That way the fan girls can fan girl over their tragic personalities and i can puke on how ridiculously stereotypical they are. \\n\\n\r\nWe have Mr. Braincells who is socially awkward and doesn't understand love.\\n\r\nThe mysterious negative emo with a broken home.\\n\r\nAn extremely energetic big brother type and not to forget \\n\r\nthe disgustingly slimy womanizer who tries to make you feel sorry for him because all the girls fall for him. \\n\\n\r\n(so far this anime still sounds kind of interesting... damn...)\\n\\n\r\nNo offence to those who had a favorite boy. I'd by lying if I said I didn't.  After all I'm a girl and most of us are infected with shipping disease. There has to be a couple right? \\n\\n\r\nOh! there is also a supporting character that is supposed to be helping the main character to get through her amnesia but he pops up for 2 minutes every 4 episodes and gives almost no help at all. Well... maybe he does. He tells her when to talk and run at least because apparently, she doesn't know when to do that. Which brings me to the worst, saddest, most pathetic female lead in the history of anime.  \\n\\n\r\nShe was so pathetic she didn't even deserve a name and there fore, I can not insult her by using her name because she really doesn't have one. \\n\\n\r\nOut of all the important memories you'd want to return, your name should be a priority right? Neither did anyone else bother to use it at any point during these 12 episodes....hmmm... *suspicion rises* \\n\\n\r\nNow let me sum up her personality in three simple words you probably learned in kindergarten and if you ever watch the show, you'll realize how spot on I am: \\n\\n\r\nWalking, talking, rock. \\n\\n\r\nSometimes she wasn't even talking at all. Just making weird little shy girl sounds. That didn't bother me as much as the fact that she couldn't do anything by herself though. She couldn't even think by herself. In a dangerous situation she did nothing unless someone told her what to do. If you ever want to complain about something objectifying women, complain about this. She was just like an object and not more interesting than the hat she is always wearing on her kawaii little head. \\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the art style.\\n\r\nI did not love the art style since I'm not particularly fond of hair sticking out of their heads like spiky antennas or the weird three colored eyes that makes it look like they are constantly sleepy or bored but after a while it became oddly satisfying and I started to realize the slight charm hidden behind those weird goth clothes. \\n\\n\r\nI can not comment on the soundtrack very much since it wasn't very memorable and the opening and ending didn't really interest me so i can't comment on those either since I always skipped. \\n\\n\r\nSo to end my positive review: \\n\r\nThis anime wasn't as good as it could have been since it had a weak story line and a bad ending not to mention the superficial bonds that were created between the boring, spine less characters that couldn't convince me one bit when they confessed their love all over the place. They couldn't even manage to carry out the one thing the whole anime was about (giving her her memories back)\\n\r\nThe art style was peculiar but oddly satisfying while the soundtrack wasn't memorable at all. It was bad from episode 1 and it was a drag getting through the episodes although they were only 12. \\n\r\nThe ending was a twist but it was not believable enough to even deserve a reference and if you like this anime and think I'm wrong and made a bigger mistake than Microsoft Office when they gave birth to Clippy, I am not sorry, i just didn't like this anime. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so I finally just finished Amnesia.  In my attempt to watch every episode I awaited for each episode of her confusion for me to be a little less confused.  I tried to make sense of what was going on and where they were going to go with the story, and then I saw the end.  I was actually disappointed that I had wasted my time watching it.  \r\nStory:  You can't really explain much of the story without ruining the horrible \"mystery\" I suppose.  Heroine has amnesia, who knew right...in which every episode is her trying to figure outwhat's going on, and who she's with.  Yes, it's a reverse harem.  The story to me was awful.  They could have put a lot more effort into creating more drama and mystery, but you were left more with a scratching your head in a bad way wondering what's going on rather than a cognitively stimulated way.  And then the end came. Then the end came and I felt like it dragged on forever.  I sat literally wondering, \"When is this going to be over, and are they going to actually do something.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art isn't bad, it's colorful, and bright.  However, the characters eyes are left with you wondering if they have some \"special\" power...but maybe that's just the style they used.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters in this story were terrible.  I felt like some were randomly thrown in and the connections they had to the MC were completely irrelevant or stupid.  A lot of the characters had no back story, especially the Heroine, the one you probably could have used a little bit of a back story on.  You don't get much however.  Their interaction with each other is unnatural and odd.  The characters in this series disappointed me greatly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  I didn't really do enjoyment because I don't feel like I enjoyed much of this anime at all.  I can say if you want an anime with sustenance do not watch this anime.  If you want an anime with a good mystery that leaves you wanting more, this isn't it.  If you want a dull and boring anime that has bright and pretty colorful characters you can stare at that really don't mean anything, then this anime is for you!  My overall experience of this anime is poor.  I was hoping by some means they would thrill me somehow with the end, and really come out with some amazing plot twist or something...but that didn't happen for me.",

            "content": "Amnesia: I Wish I Had It After This\r\nActually, you know what, I'm pretty sure I'll be contracting amnesia when it comes to this series because it is one of the more forgettable pieces of work I've seen so far this year. It was incredibly underwhelming. It's sad to see Brains Base put out such a terrible piece of work, especially considering how well they've done with series' like Natsume Yuujinchou, Baccano, Spice+Wolf and Durarara. This series doesn't even come close to capturing the same magic as those series. So where did this series go astray? Honestly, it fails when it comes to its plot andits characters. \\n\\n\r\nAmnesia is about a girl who wakes up on August 1st only to find out that she has amnesia (go figure) and doesn't remember anything prior to the date she awakened. As soon as she wakes up, she discovers she can see a strange, fairy-like being known as Orion that no one else can see, as Orion tries to assist this girl in trying to recover her memories. As the series progresses, the protagonist continues to get into accidents only to awaken on August 1st all over again, except she seems to awaken in an alternate dimension where her relationships are slightly different.\\n\\n\r\nThis series was painful to watch for many reasons. The first being the characters are downright terrible. The protagonist isn't even given a name throughout the series. I'm assuming the biggest reason is due to Amnesia being an adaptation to a visual novel where you program your own desired name. Having a nameless protagonist works fine in a visual novel...but not an anime. The protagonist felt detracted from the rest of the characters because she had no name or at least wasn't referred to by name. It's just hard to get invested in a nameless character. The least Brains Base could've done was give her a name. Can you imagine if Aniplex didn't name the lead protagonist in the Persona 4: The Animation? It would be so much harder to get invested in \"Yuu Narukami's\" character because it would be detracting that the other characters won't refer to him by name. At any rate, to get back on topic, that's still no excuse for the rest of the characters. Besides Ukyou, all of the characters felt bland as cardboard and that might be an insult to cardboard. All of her potential love interests were either uninteresting or just had unappealing personality quirks. Still, as much as I disliked all of the characters, the protagonist ground my gears the most. While I realize she had amnesia and that can throw off how you would normally act, her thoughts and actions were completely illogical. Her methods of trying to get her memories back were extremely round-a-bout and it seemed like whenever she decided on doing something, I smacked my forehead out of frustration and screamed \"idiot!\" at my computer screen. The protagonist was a weak character with almost no redeemable qualities whatsoever. She acted illogically, she had zero personality, and the series provided very little motivation to her character whatsoever. I haven't seen a lead female protagonist in an anime this bad since watching Felicita in Arcana Famiglia. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot and story was abysmal. I will admit that this series did have a nice mystery element at first. It was really the only reason why I even kept watching because I was intrigued as to why she would continue to wake up on August 1st and I was intrigued as to why she kept ending up in different dimensions. However, the payoff was far from satisfactory and I felt duped by the time it was all said and done. The explanations that were given to us in the end were baffling at best and all-in-all, I was still left with more questions than answers. On top of that, I found this series to be riddled with cliches and the scriptwriting to be downright piss poor. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is sadly one of the better aspects of this series and even then, I wouldn't call it \"good.\" From a technical standpoint, the animation isn't bad. I just found the character designs to be dreadful. Overall, I just couldn't get past how ridiculous the character and costume designs were for each character. While I am aware that the series was trying to implement a \"playing card\" atmosphere for each character, how they were designed was off-putting and somewhat corny. One of the more off-putting aspects of it was how the characters never changed clothes. They continuously looked and dressed the same throughout the entire thing. The ONLY costume change I can recall is the lead protagonist in her normal everyday clothes and her night gown. That's it. Again, much like the character name, that is something that might work in a visual novel, but not an anime. \\n\\n\r\nI will say ONE good thing about Amnesia. It did have some really good music composition. This was Yoshiaki Dewa's first series in regards to music direction and I must say, he did a remarkably good job. The theme songs by Yagi Yanagi and Ray were both really well done and they were the few bright spots I can say about this series. \\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, I have only a few words to share for Yoshimitsu Ohashi (Director) and Brains Base. This was terrible. This was an absolutely terrible attempt at adapting a visual novel that probably would've been difficult to adapt in the first place. They committed several cardinal sins in the adaptation process and some of which are downright unforgivable. The best way I can describe it on the whole is lazy. This series was lazily written and lazily produced. It didn't try to tell a compelling story. It didn't try to create an engaging romance between the protagonists and the love interests. It didn't try in almost every aspect of anime production. I cannot recommend this series to anyone and I can assure you this is probably going to end up on my Worst Animes of 2013 list. If there was ever an example of how to NOT adapt a visual novel to anime, Amnesia is probably the best example I can think of.",

            "content": "---Status: 4/12 episodes | Overall rating: 7,3\r\nOkay, I take back what I've said before. Amnesia is better than the animes I compared it with. Finally it seems to get really interesting and exciting because of this time leap and time switch confusion. Well, the girl is still lifeless but the riddle becomes quite interesting. It's pretty clich\u00e9 shoujo atmosphere but at least that's not everything and there are many open questions which make you want to know more about the circumstances. \r\nAnd I kind of enjoy Shin's dominat temper towards her. ;) Furthermore, I'm curious about the attitude of the other male characters when theybecome a part of her life in this time leaping world. ;)\\n\\n\r\n--- status: 3/12 episodes | Overall rating: 5\\n\r\nAmnesia reminds me of Neo Angelique Abyss and Kimi ga Nozomu Eien: \\n\r\nThe heroine is mentally absent, puzzled, confused, obedient, submissive, has a lack of own opinions, no temper and is boring. There's nor charm nor allurement. There's a supporting character (in Kimi: the sister | in Amnesia: the ghost) who is kind of annoying. In Angelique and Amnesia you can find many pretty boys but this cannot replace any content. \\n\\n\r\nAt least there's a ray of hope and that's why I think this series might get interesting. Her boyfriend, Shin, says the heroine's personality is different from before. Usually, she'd get angry if he kissed her or become upset when he did this and that - but this usual reaction was missing and he remarked it. So maybe she had a personality and is on her way to get it back? \\n\\n\r\nAlso some characters might get interesting and that's why I'll watch it for a while. There still might be some potential but I don't expect much of it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the art is really beautiful and the character's two-colored eyes are pretty creative.",

Romance them all and find out whom you like the most! And die once in a while. Literally.\r\nThe music is bland and forgettable, but I liked the opening and ending. \r\nIf you like facepalming yourself few times per minute while watching some poorly animated, wanna-be-deep-and-mysterious anime, this isthe thing you're looking for. Great for watching with friends! Just bring gallons of alcohol and make shots every time our nameless heroine says \"eeh\". Have fun, I certainly do!",

            "content": "Story: 5/10\r\n- Given that the anime made the viewer (that is me) wanting to keep watching until the mystery unraveled.\r\nThis anime brings a lot of emphasis into the protagonist of the story, who is a lost girl with no memories of herself at all. In the anime, she produces a scarce personality where the guy characters could do ALMOST anything to her without a  fight. She does not feel any specific emotions throughout the story and she lacks character. She would react with a character the same way with another because of this lack of personality. Although she has amnesia, this lost attitude iswhat made the other characters seem more important than the 'Heroine'.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was amazing. The eyes of the characters were colourful and brought a lot of life into them. The male characters were given a slim overall body shape and the main female character was given a (I guess) an average look.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the specific ending's music box melody, the ending theme, the opening theme. The music box melody gave a lot of feelings and emotions in the anime. As for the opening and ending theme, they were produced very well that was quite catchy for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I did not like the Heroine's personality, I liked her innocent and caring self. It sometimes made me think that it's too unreal to be true, even with amnesia. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the male characters, I did not like most of them due to their assertiveness throughout the story (except for one). However, I like the uniqueness of each of the male characters and how each of them are valued differently by the Heroine.\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed when the Heroine is able to develop through the story. She produces a more distinct self as the anime goes on. I also enjoyed how she reacts with the various male characters in the plot. However, the ending seemed rushed, where most of the mystery unravels at the end of episode 11. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\n- I would recommend this to viewers who likes mystery in a way; however, make sure to not be too surprised at the end of the anime.\\n",

This kept me watching the new episode as soon as it was available and subbed. Although many will watch reverse harem's for the romance that is in them i think this story is good for it's mystery aspect instead. The thing that let the story down i found was that it wasn't long enough which didn't give it long enough to develop themystery\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was the first thing that made me want to watch it. The art in this anime is very pretty and detailed. It the effects of the shadows and sudden colour were very good for setting the mood.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime was nice and simple although it didn't particially stand out to me other than the opening and ending which i never skipped. But it was very nice so i think it deserves an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nSome of the characters were very interesting and unexpected however other character's were very predictable and stereotypical. If it were only some side character's that were predictable it would have been good but instead the main character was one of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nDespite the flaws in this anime i thoroughly enjoyed this anime and am waiting for the game to be translated into english so that i can find out more of the mystery. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nOverall this anime wasn't perfect but if your looking for an anime with some mystery, some romance and Amazing art i recommend Amnesia.",

Amnesia is a series full of mystery and internal struggle on the canvas of alternative world traveling,all while adding a drop of romance to finish the cocktail. It begs its viewers to do some detective job in order to understand it, I know this because I had a hard time at first putting all the  facts together or you can say I'm somewhat of a dummy.\r\nHere is a personal opinion that I assume nobody gives a damn about:\r\nGreat story, very intriguingart concept for both background and characters. Epic OST's (some of the best I've heard). Also characters are totally different from one another except they have this air of coolness about them.\\n\r\nGeneral opinion\\n\r\nA very dramatic piece of art that shows how much someone can do to accomplish a wish out of love.\\n\r\nHope you like it... and if you don't,well, bummer.",

            "content": "First of all, I can't understand why people give this Anime a bad review after watching 1-3 episodes. A lot of people mentioned the reason they dropped it is the story line being too confusing to understand. Now, if you would read the synopsis of this anime, you could guess that it won't be easy to understand, especially since it's not fully aired. Just because you can't comprehend, it doesn't mean the story is bad. A lot of animes start off weird and slowly explain what's going on. No one can expect to fully understand what is happening in Amnesia after 6 Episodes.  I'lltry to keep spoilers as low as possible here. \\n\\n\r\nNow to the review itself, what actually got me drawn to this Anime was the (for me) outstanding and appealing art style. It is obviously a Shoujo-Anime so the target audience is mainly female. I've seen a lot of people describing the main character, Heroine, as dull, boring, quiet and a bit silly. I think she is a cute and kind character and it is pretty obvious, that after losing all her memories, not knowing who she is, where she is and what her relationships with any of the people she meets are, she is just being cautious and doesn't know how to interact properly. Especially in the following episodes where she is waking up in a new world (always on the 1st of August) with mixed up memories and relationships again (mostly without Orion's guidance) she gets confused. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I'm not too judgmental of it yet since I've watched a lot of Animes that start explaining what's happening in the last few episodes. \\n\r\nOf course after watching 6 episodes so far you can guess that it has a lot to do with Ukyo (the green haired dude who is friendly to her but seems a bit vicious when he's alone) and my guess is that before she's being sent  to another world, she always dies in the previous one (various incidents that could cause death'). This is merely an assumption though.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, can't wait for the next episodes! Absolutely love the idea so far, will see what they make of it.",

The story itself sounded intriguing, but as I continued through the episodes I found myself wondering how each one will match up to the description which I read. It did however match up to its main genre, a reverseharem which is one positive thing about this anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was one of the main reasons I decided to finish this anime, the art was not brilliant, but I enjoyed the card theme which was displayed throughout the anime and I have to admit, the outfits were somewhat amazing. Other than that the manner in which the characters themselves, excluding the outfits, were somewhat normal, but all in all the art did give this anime some form of value.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the art the sound, especially the opening song, did do their job somewhat well and I was impressed by the effort they placed within the music. I have to say the sound of the anime usually makes or breaks it for me and what can I say, even though this anime fell under the genre I would usually avoid, it did have great sound sound quality. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was, well, extremely poorly done. There was little if none character development and the main character just made me frown. She was barely spoke and never really truly developed. If it had not been for the great music and the intriguing art theme I would not have been able to finish this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\\n\r\nI did not at all enjoy this anime, but it had a few humors moments which made it somewhat enjoyable.

Well the show is not at all poor in any sense.\r\nWriting this review after watching 7 eps. and I have to say, I totally look forward to this show every week. In fact its hard to wait for a week actually to see what's gonna happen next.\r\nStory [10/10]: I loved the concept of the show- A girl, who, every time she experiences some kind of shock wakes up, finds her surroundings changed. How she and the people around her respond to it is the essence of the story till now. I loved thedirection of this show. The scenes change at a very good pace which keeps the mystery alive in each episode. And especially the last scene cut at the end of Ep. 7. It was so subtle!\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation [10/10]: Full marks here as well :) The characters are all gorgeous and the backgrounds are well suited to all the scenes. Animation is top notch for me as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound [8/10]: The OP and ED are both very groovy. The background music isn't too much noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [8/10]: I loved the way the girls character was handled. Her responses to all the things she experiences was very well crafted. As for the guys they are not bad. All are suspicious looking at the beginning but you get a flavor of their personalities with each episode. When the protagonist is in a particular world with one guy, the others dont even appear anywhere. This can be both a positive or a negative point - The former -> since it helps in highlighting the incidents of a particular world where one of them is the girl's partner. The latter -> Since the creators of the show could have added many situation in which such interactions of the girl would be complicated by including the other characters influence to the flow of events. But again I am satisfied fully with watching what I am shown :)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall [9/10]: I am enjoying every bit of this show. Its got all the right amount of mystery to it And the pace of the show is good as well. So completely recommended to watch *thumbs up*",

            "content": "I always watch anime with a friend / friends, and many of my male friends didn't really enjoy this anime as much as my female friends did, so I'm going to assume that this is an anime most girls would enjoy. Here is my point of view on this anime:\r\n[STORY] - 10/10\r\n-----------\r\nFor one, the story is centered around a girl which we have no idea what her name is, and we just decided to name her 'Heroine' for some odd reason. I for one found that pretty interesting because they lasted 12 episodes and an OVA without mentioning her name, which I was pretty impressedby. The plot of this story was also very interesting to me, because it was shoujo and reversed harem. The heroine of this story was being protected by several handsome male leads, and I found that very romantic. The ending was also very surprising, but you'll have to watch for yourself to see what happens.\\n\\n\r\n[ART] - 10/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was very clear and high quality. Not much to say here, really. They were also very detailed when it came to lighting, and when the scenes took place in the dark, you could still clearly see what was happening without having to be 1 inch away from the screen trying to figure out what was going on. \\n\\n\r\n[SOUND] - 9/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe theme song of this anime, Zoetrope, is one of my favorite anime openings. No... it is my favorite out of all the openings I have watched. Many of my friends explained it as \"mysterious\", meaning that they were very curious on what the anime was about, adding that the animation of the theme didn't include any spoilers (in my eyes), while several other openings of other anime did. I've also watched both dubbed and subbed of this anime, and the dubbed version of several characters were kind of timid, but it still showed the character's true colors and personality. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER] - 10/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe character designs of this anime is one of my favorites. I loved the design of the characters' eye colors and hair highlights, especially the clothing. The clothing was very interesting, especially Shin's style of clothes. It really showed that it was like a fantasy. Orion was also a very interesting character to look into. Even though he didn't appear much in the anime, he was also very cute and really made me curious on where he was when he disappeared from couple episodes.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]  - 10/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed this anime a lot, but I have read the reviews of this anime, and not many people actually liked it as much as I did, which really shocked me. Again, I feel like this anime is more enjoyed by a female audience rather than a male audience, although some males would probably still like it. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]  - 10/10\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThis anime is one of my top favorite romance / shoujo animes. I have watched a lot of romance and shoujo animes, but none of them were as mysterious as this anime. I also personally really dislike comedy, which in this case, really made me like this anime a lot. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE:\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "You. Yeah, you. Are you a lonely teenage girl who doesn't care about anything but sexy bishies? You are? That's good man, that's real good! If you aren't, please turn away and forget that this exists. After watching this you wish to have amnesia to forget it.\r\nNOTE: This anime is based on a dating simulation for girls. I must say, the opening got me already interested. Expect for the fact she was kissing with every guy, it looked really interesting. So did the beginning. The main character is seen trying to escape a building about to collapse. She is then seen working in a cafe,where she apparently has a black-out. And... that's all we get to know in the entire anime about her. I mean, it's about amnesia and all, but that's not a reason to give your characters no backstory or even a NAME. So I guess we just call her 'Heroine'. And if that is not enough yet, she seems to be okay with everything. She can't express herself, and sometimes has problems saying yes or no. At some times the guys even got a bit rapey, but she seems to be completely okay with that and doesn't protest. Either way, the story. It was an interesting concept, Heroine has amnesia and a mysterious pixie named Orion shows up and helps her recover her memories. BTW, the memories are not from her childhood and such, but from her boyfriend. Ughh... first 10 episodes, no progress at all. No plot and very confusing. And then two last episodes, SUGAR RUSH! Since I can't really tell more unless I start telling spoilers, let's move on.\\n\r\nI already said what I thought about the Heroine. Most boring, idiotic and foolish character in a long while. The other characters (In other words, the bishies) are pretty much the ones you find in dating games. The popular one, smart one, shy one, crazy one and mysterious one. They don't have much backstory either actually, and sometimes really treated the Heroine as shit. But you already know she loves being pushed around. Though as I female, I must admit I did like their design a lot. They all looked unique and their eyes...oh god. Might be the best thing in this anime. Might be the best anime eyes I've ever seen. But one thing bothered me.. were these the sons of Slenderman? They really had such long legs it scared me.Okay, this is a reverse harem, but it did not feel romantic at all. Maybe it was because she had amnesia, but it felt like they were two strangers kissing. It's not like she really build a relationship with one of them.\\n\r\nThe sound is good, I already said I loved the opening. Voice actors sound okay, Heroine had kind of an annoying voice though.\\n\r\nSo, in other words, even for a dating simulation adaption, this was horrible. You might watch because the guys are pretty cute and sexy, but if you're not interested in that you will not find anything of interest. You will start crying because of the stupidity of the Heroine, and your brain will hurt from the confusing (if it actually is there) plot. I say it again, if your dream is to be surrounded by hot guys, this is perfect for you.",

            "content": "What was I about to say??????????Oh, I'm here to make a review, man this amnesia thing is getting into me. So, at lot of people say that this anime is the worse at the start of 2013, well, they're half right, considering the fact if one focuses too much on the characters' flamboyant goth attires which would make one think that this anime was all art and not much content. But, if one drops this anime too early, then he or she doesn't know what he or she misses. Though, this anime was once an \"Otome game\" it wasn't a surprise that the director, YoshimitsuOhashi did it that way where we the audience would be taken for a ride as the main character Heroine travels from one alternate world to the next trying to find out what's really going on with her memories as well as the various arc that comes with every plot from one alternate universe to the next. I'm a bit disappointed with the following: Orion's inability to physically help the main character, Kent's one time arc with the main character and Touma's animalistic treatment of the main character. It was nice to know that even though that this anime revolves around Heroine, she was kinda cutsy but I hate the clothes she was wearing, she basically this kind of a woman who is the very epitome of unconditional love and compassion though that scene with Touma was something that shouldn't happen to a sweet character like her. It was good that the anime did ended with a bit of suspense on the side with Uky\u014d and it looks that where this anime's writer,  Touko Machida was counting on, but as this anime ends, we're life with a sort of cliffhanger as to which world did she choose to go to, end.\\n\\n\r\nSo, here are my category ratings for this anime:\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI like the way that this anime's plot was confusing at first, that's if one was to drop this anime prematurely. But as it progresses the picture becomes clear.\\n\\n\r\nArt: poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nAy, yay, yay, what can I say, this was probably the most unnecessary overdecorated anime I've ever seen, it like putting too many condiments and spices in the food that you no longer taste the food.\\n\\n\r\nSound: fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nI just have no comment about the sound, since Orion's seiyuu was a chica, then studio Brains Base should've consider making Orion's gender a chica as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: good 7.\\n\\n\r\nI guess for a chica who was as sweet as kind as her, she really did carried the anime direction very well, though, I would've wish that she has the guts to stand up against Ikki's bitches.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: very good 8.\\n\\n\r\nIt was something that one can  look forward of watching it and can't wait for the ending. It was also nice that there is this little cliffhanger of which the main character has to choose as to which world does she want to returned to, as long as it ain't Touma's world.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: very good 8.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a blast to watch it, the mystery, romance, shoujo, reverse harem and suspense did played well. The End.\\n\\n",

It's like she doesn't know if she's dreaming or awake.  She doesn't know which reality is the true reality.  It's based off an otome game so it's a reverse harem.  It's cool but very confusing.  However the art is amazing.  The detail on the eyes are cool, I've sort of observed that all otome game adapted animes have detailed art.  So if you like reverse harems or otome games, this is a good one!",

            "content": "STORY:\r\nThe story of Amnesia isn't exactly your typical romance, it is a tale of a girl trying to find her happiness with a different guy every few episodes. I thought the plot of Amnesia was pretty mediocre, admittedly I enjoyed the first few episodes but after continuing I found it pretty boring and VERY repetitive to say the least. There isn't much I can say about the story of Amnesia without me sounding like I'm completely hating on it; overall I believe the story was ok and will give it the credit of being fairly original.\r\nART:\r\nThe one thing I'd like to praise this anime foris the art, I thought all the character designs from the clothes to the facial features were detailed and beautiful. Amnesia had artwork better than alot of the more popular anime out there in all honesty.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe sound isn't amazing nor is it awful, the opening I thought was very good and I really enjoyed it, however the ending didn't quite live up to the opening. The background sound wasn't very memorable and was pretty average.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nEach of the main characters had a fairly in depth background story minus the Heroine considering her amnesia. All the characters were pretty decent until I realized that half of the main characters were deranged, one being OVERLY protective and the other being bipolar; the female lead lacked personality for me and was very bland not to mention useless. The other two remaining main characters were likable to me. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nAs I said earlier I enjoyed the first few episodes of Amnesia but found it hard it enjoy the rest. I found it a little irritating to complete the rest of the anime. I may have even really liked the anime if it wasn't so mad, far fetched and repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nOverall I believe Amnesia was a pretty dull anime which lacked interest, a relatable or fun story and likable characters. The first few episodes seemed promising but after that it seemed to unfortunately go down hill which resulted in me not liking the remainder of the anime.",

I love the eyes, love the clothes , love their voices and all\\n\r\nthe guys are just, all , perfect in a way so, no complaints about that one\\n\r\neven if the story lacks, we still have candy for the eye and ears... I guess... \\n\r\nso overall I'm very satisfied with the art in that aspect (the surroundings , background, movements,... ain't all that much but , I don't really care, it's not a sports anime or anything)\\n\\n\r\nthough for some of you , the pacing might seem to go slow, actually , everytime an 'arc' with a guy ends , I'm like 'allready?' 'was that all?'\\n\r\nI have no idea where they're trying to go with this show (what kind of ending are they gonna make cause the game has loads of endings) and \\n\r\nit might turn out being just another cheap-plot girly fluff 'I love you let's be together forevah and evah' anime \\n\r\nI'll be crossing my fingers till the last episode for it to be worth it xD\\n\\n\r\nI love the opening theme and vid, love the ending vid , \\n\r\nso in short:\\n\\n\r\nAmnesia has a nice package of good designs , pretty boys, great and fitting voice actors nice art and pretty good sound\\n\\n\r\neven if the story's not really worth it, maybe the guys are? xD\\n\r\nand well, if you compare it with other otome anime , it ain't all that bad \\n\r\nthere's only a few otome I actually managed to watch completely, \\n\r\nand even less I actually managed to love, so I've learned not to expect too much when one is gonna air\\n\r\nI strongly advice you guys to play the game though :D\\n\\n\\n",

But this fucking Anime managed to make me do it so at least that's something I can give this flaming pile of shit credit for.\r\nThe story is rather simple: A girl has amnesia, as the titlewould suggest and gets into parallel universes of her life, which is always just slightly different, every time she dies. As I am typing this the Story-idea actually sounds interesting holy shit, but don't be deceived. While the idea is good in my opinion the end result is not. Some people would excuse this with the Anime being based on an Otome-game, which honestly are always not that thought out story- and characterwise, it's still not an excuse to produce absolute shit. The only thing that somehow saved the story for me that the spooky mystery of all this was explained in the last two episodes and made sense more or less. But still it was only more or less, so still pretty much shit.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, their behaviour and their actions made me so angry and annoyed that I had to leave my Computer regularlly to calm down. Holy Gucamoly. It pissed me off so much. Simply said the characters were all, with out an exception flat and simply stupid. None of their actions made sense.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so this is were the actual rambling begins. I made notes while watching this. I wrote everything down that annoyed me or made no sense and I can tell you that it's a lot. I also just want to say that I know the names of the characters I just refuse to call them by them. Except for our Heroine who's name maybe got lost in translation or in the German subtitles, but it was not said once there, so I honestly don't know if she has a name or not.\\n\\n\r\nSo first off the characters are all assholes. And I don't mean that they behave rude or anything. I mean that every character who noticed that MC had amnesia just didn't really seem to care about it. The worst with this was the Red dude. He noticed immediately and even called her out on it, and I would say that you could expect from your partner that they would try to help you with this huge fucking problem. But not Red dude. He made it all about himself and he only talked about himself and his own struggles with his girlfriend having amnesia instead of being there for her. And this was the case for most of the characters. Everybody only talks and only cares for themselves which seemed weird to me because they all were MCs boyfriend in one parallel universe.\\n\\n\r\nAlso when MCs hair was cut off by these totally creepy Fanclub members of Blue dude everybody acted like they cut off a limb or something, but the hair grew back in a matter of seconds. This was probably just a production mistake or laziness from the production team, but still her hair was immediately back to the same length. Made me laugh out loud so that's at least something positive.\\n\\n\r\nOne fucking HUGE point are the characters clothes. Like, all of them. What the actual fuck are they wearing. Like, you see all these background characters being dressed normal and then you see the main cast and just wonder why no one is calling the police on them.\\n\\n\r\nGreen bois cloak is so damn ugly I actually have no words. And the best part is that he is some kind of Doctor in Mathematics and just sits in his office with this hideous long leather cloak. How to any of his colleagues take him seriously? How does he work in this? Is it actually comfortable? Why are there so many straps on the cloak ( I counted 20) and how long does it take to close them all when putting this thing on? I have so many questions.\\n\\n\r\nYellow bois clothes are arguably the most normal. The only thing weird about it is the ripped yellow cloth tied around his waist but that's about it. But don't worry kids, all the weirdness that would have went into his outfit went into his character so that's something to be happy about.\\n\\n\r\nBlue dudes clothes are no better, I mean, his jacket is just weird and looks like he's some kind of steampunk butler and he ALSO has a useless strap on his arm (one character designer seems to have a thing for these somehow which only adds to my confusion). His shirt is okay, still not something I'd buy but hey, each their own. But why is he wearing gloves all the time? Why is everybody else wearing gloves all the time? They do mention several times that it's really cold for August but it can't be that fucking cold 'cause all the girls are walking around in their kawaii fucking skirts. But what's most hideous about Blue dudes outfit is for one his hair clipper and his fucking drawn on Spade under his eye. Actually no, that's not the worst. The worst is his fucking shoes. On one side he wears a regular normal looking black shoe. But that wouldn't be edgy enough right? This is too normal for all the lonely teenage girls who are watching this garbage. On his other foot he wears a fucking thigh high boot. Nothing sexier on a man than that right Ladies?\\n\\n\r\nBut beware. This is topped by Red dude. His outfit is probably the worst. Not only does he wear a long ripped shirt, skinny jeans which are red on one side and black on the other, gloves because how else could it be and an actually rather normal looking leather jacket. He also wears a useless beltstrap hanging down to one side 'cause fashion and two straps around his neck, one black and one red. BUT that's not all. He doesn't wear one but TWO thigh high boots which are as everything else on him, red and black. This is so fucking edgy I think I cut myself.\\n\\n\r\nPhotographer dudes clothes are also a thing for itself. He wears this long ass coat which has an asymmetrical hemline and some kind of skirt over his simple trousers (because trousers alone would be TOO simple) which seems to be connected to his coat somehow. Must be a pain in the ass to take a piss while wearing this thing. He also wears some kind of hat, a vomit coloured shirt and a tie that's always knotted loosely. Why wear a tie to begin with if you don't wear it properly at least once goddamnit? Because fashion. But the best thing about his outfit are his stilettos. He walks perfectly on these heels which actually surprised me. I love them.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, MC travels into a slightly different parallel univers every time she dies which actually sounds like a good idea. The problem with this is HOW she always dies. I guess the writer of this either had really no idea how to let MC die almost every two episodes basically or they just don't know how humans behave. Maybe they're an alien. Don't want to discriminate. Her first death is her literally RUNNING of a cliff. Suicide? You think. No, she's just stupid.\\n\r\nFor her second death she gets run over by a car. Alright. This is acceptable. Or it would be, if she wasn't almost run over by a car in nearly every episode. So what can we say? She's just stupid.\\n\r\nThe third death is HIGHLY stupid since MC drowned. Well, now you may think that she simply can't swim and maybe that's the case but I don't know because it was never clarified. She simply fell into the water and did not move anymore, sinking like a stone. Someone who can't swim would at least TRY to keep their head over water. So she's just stupid.\\n\r\nAnd well for her fourth death she didn't even actually die. She just let go of Green bois hand. And while this was actually a nice transition to her being in a world where she's with Yellow boi it simply doesn't make sense. How does her letting go of a hand is equivalent to her dying? Damn dude must have died a lot in my lifetime then.\\n\\n\r\nAn other stupid thing was that no one would recognize Blue dude when he put on his sunglasses. As if no one would recognize his motherfucking ugly clothes. Clark Kent much? And an OTHER thing related to this is Blue dudes absolutely creepy Fan-Club. I know that there are some people like that, like Sasaengs in K-Pop and stuff but damn. Instead of calling the police on them like any normal being would Blue dude actually chills with them. Understandable, right? They only tried to kill MC for talking to him like two or three times. Totally normal.\\n\r\nYou know, I actually kinda liked Blue dude in the beginning. Sure, he's a stupid whore but in comparison to the others he seemed rather normal. What killed his character for me was the explanation as to why all the girls want a piece from him. It's because he wished for it as he saw a shooting star when he was six. If shooting stars actually worked like that I'd be fucking rich by now. Well, this could be excused with \"Neil-sama trying to fulfill humans wishes\", but I don't actually think that that's the reason they added this to his character, as he himself says that it's more like a burden, so that would go against everything Neil is trying to do. I just think that it's a lazy excuse.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing pretty about this Anime is how the characters eyes are coloured and even that was ruined for me because of Blue dudes fucking stupid shooting star story and the effect his \"magical eyes\"\u2122 have on girls.\\n\\n\r\nYellow boi was the most sympathetic character to me in the beginning. But ooooooooooh boi that is not the case. He's an actual psychopath which goes very well with MCs braindeadness. Like, when the little Fairy mate tells her not to eat or drink anything Yellow boi gives her because he's drugging her with it. What does our bright light do? Takes a huge fucking sip of that drugged coffee. Tasty. \\n\r\nThe best part of MC being held in Yellow bois apartment against her will was when Red dude showed up because he suspected that something was wrong. He even questioned wether MC actually wants to be there. Any normal being would now, that a friend is there who not only noticed himself that something is wrong but also would surely help them, tell them that they don't actually want to be there and that tehy're being drugged. Or maybe not that but at least the first part. What does MC say instead? \"Please don't fight\". \\n\r\nLike honestly at this point it's just Natural Selection. I actually WANT her to die, because she is simply too fucking stupid to be kept alive.\\n\r\nAnd honestly, Yellow boi went out of his way to buy a huge fucking metal cage to keep MC in, so he could at least bought one were he has a little slot to slide in MCs meals and clothes and all that other shit, so he wouldn't have to open the door all the way everytime he gave her something. But oh well MC never even tried to do something or fight back so why waste money on something like that, right? MC also seems to develop a Stockholm Syndrome while she is held in Yellow bois apartment, which is even ENCOURAGED by the little Fairy mate. Like, he lets her out only once, says one nice thing and she's immediately like \"Alright mate let me touch you\". And the best part is that all of Yellow bois clearly psychopathic behaviour is excused by everyone who knows about it with \"He's actually just trying to protect her\". Like, yah, may be, but the cause doesn't excuse the action. \\n\r\nThe mos stupidiest part was when MC managed to escape from Yellow boi. Not only did she take the time to put on her own clothes again, 'cause hey, why hurry right? But she ALSO was stupid enough to instead of going to the police go to her own apartment, where the psychopath can find her easily AND has a doorkey for which he actually MENTIONED before.\\n\\n\r\nA huge thing that bothered me about this Anime was that every bruise or cut MC got was treated like they found out that she had cancer or was stabbed in the guts or something. MC also has a thing for tripping over nothing which is very kawaii desu ne and desirable and not stupid A T  A L L, am I right? But oh well, that's the case in most Animes so I won't whine too much about it.\\n\\n\r\nUp until this point  I actually thought that Fairy mate was the character that was the most normal and logically thinking, but no. He supports MC in her Stockholm Syndrome which also puts him on the \"braindead List\". So far every single character is on it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat bothered me the most about MC was something I noticed while she was caged by Yellow boi. Her survival instinct are completely absent. I even would say that they go into negative numbers. Like, honestly. Everytime she activally does something to safe her own life it's because someone TOLD her to do it and not because her own instincts tell her to. If it was up to her she would just fucking sit or stand there, no matter what happened. She seems to be actually braindead. Most of her lines consist of \"Uhm...\" and \"Huh...?\", which makes for a very interesting and immersible character. 10/10. \\n\r\nAnd well, as was said before, MC actually deserves to die in my opinion because she's so fucking stupid, braindead and nothing but a bother to those around her. So next time there's a car again that almost drives her over there shouldn't be someone who pulls her back.\\n\r\nMCs stupidity really shines when she meets Photographer dude. Fairy mate tells her that he probably has a split personality, because the dumb shit wouldn't notice herself even if her life depended on it (which it actually does, but as we established before MC has no survival instinct so maybe that's the reason), and Photographer dude even tells her himself not to trust him and not to meet him alone, because while one side loves her the other personality is trying to kill her. Well, MC being MC doesn't listen to any of them, because there are no survival instincts in her to tell her to do so and literally does everything she was told not to do. So in the last episode I hoped so hard that she would finally die for good even though I knew that an Anime like this would never end like that. Her running to the top of a tower while the building was burning still made me kind of hopeful, because again, that's just a plainly stupid thing to do.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course she doesn't die, everybody gets saved and I lost my last three braincells because of this shit. Maybe I am now as braindead as MC. Who knows. \\n\\n\r\nI will hate the first of August forever now because of this shit. Thank you very much.",

            "content": "Thus, another anime that proves that you can NOT compress a VN into 12 episodes.\r\nStory:\r\nDespite the fact that this anime does contain more plot than your average shoujo it still fell short. It did deviate from your average shoujo to some extent: MC is in college instead of high school, it had a bit of mystery, it had (a little bit) more for it going on other than picking the cutest boy, and so on. The problem is that this really isn't the anime's doing, the reason the anime is partially interesting is because it's really just a shadow of its original. It doesn't reallyhelp that the story is similar to Madoka Magica either.\\n\\n\r\nThough the anime may deviate somewhat to normal shoujo anime it also included lots of unnecessary elements. For an anime that promised a high suspense story the Maidcafe felt very out of place; and considering the character's wild outfits I was hoping for some grand supernatural plot. The only supernatural parts about the anime where Orion and [spoiler alert]---time traveling---[spoiler alert]. Finding this out made me very disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nI also found it weird that of all the otome games Brains Base could adapt they pick this one. Unlike in most VNs where the true route has its own thing, for the true route to make sense here you have to go through all of them; did they really think that they could compress that much in 12 episodes? And unlike in a game it's crucial that MC is likable, so why did they pick the game where MC had no real personality to begin with? There's a reason they replaced Red for Ash in Pokemon's anime adaption you know.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIf this anime where as pretty as the game I probably would have bumped up my overall score to 7. The atmosphere of the anime is a bit darker than your average shoujo, but again, this isn't really the anime's doing. I would have also bumped my overall ratings if it at least made up for it in really hot guys; tough they where pretty cute their unnecessary and out of place outfits made it hard to get really into them. In contrast to this I though MC's outfit was really cute. There isn't much to say about the anime's art really.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe anime's OP was actually the thing that hyped me about this anime. It had a really kick-ass OP and ED. The anime's OST however is a different story. It's not painfully generic, and I don't hate it either; but the fact that I don't remember too much about it says something. Again, there isn't too much to say about the anime's music either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nSince this is a reverse harem anime consider this an extension of my story review.\\n\r\nLet's start with MC, she has virtually no real personality. Since the game's heroine had none to begin with they had to conjure one up for the anime, we ended up with a boring, quiet, and kinda stupid heroine.\\n\\n\r\nThe boys in the anime felt shallow. In a harem anime, each character having their own 'thing' is expected; but the anime never really explores the boys beyond their 'thing'. This is probably the cause of time constraints.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst characters where Shin and Toma. They treated MC like shit, seriously. Why does Japan love them so much?\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nTough the anime posed some interesting concepts and ideas it ultimately fell short, and is really nothing more than the shadow of its game. Its a very forgettable anime.",

            "content": "When I first heard that Amnesia will have their own Anime, I was really happy since who doesn't want to watch an anime with lots of bishounens?! And the whole amnesia thing the heroine got was kind a legit, who doesnt want to know how she got it or how she'll retrieve her memories back?. I waited for a month to watch this series and then I saw it ----- and was utterly disappointed -___________-\r\nFirst of all the anime that crushed all my high expectations, bored me to death and confused me . Like who the hell wanna watch something that will confuse them?!. Iknow that all of us had smiles on our faces once we started watching this and then that smile slowly turns into a \"comfused-what-the-hell-happened\" look then into a frown. From the very beggining of this anime you'll already be confused and somewhat bored\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOf course those who waited for this anime will sure be like \"yosh!!! Its already airing!!yey!!!\" Then it will slowly turn into a \" what? What is happening?\" Then into a \"ohhhhhkay? That explains everything.... I think I now know what happened\" then into a \"what the hell just happened?! Why?! \" and finally into a \" kuso! Im done with this anime\" that's how confusing this anime is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSecond the characters are \"bad\". Like who the hell would want a useless heroine? The heroine (she doesn't have a name) is so useless that the only thing she's good at is crying and getting into \"accidents\". She never disagrees to whatever the people are telling her and she NEVER asks anyone about the stuff thats happening. For her it's only natural to be repeating the same day with somoene else -.- . She just accepts the the whole repeating thing casually -.-\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile the guys all have cliche personalities, yes , i know they're hot but their personalites are a no- go -_____-\" What do I mean by cliche? Well there's the chick magnet, the guy who befriends and is nice to  everyone, the guy who always looks for logic a.k.a the smart guy, the loner who did something \"bad\" and finally the mysterious one. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCliche isnt it?\\n\\n\\n\r\nLastly the pacing pf the story is soooo slow, the story is already at episode 10 or something and yet they're still not getting to the whole concept of this anime. It doesnt have a string that ties all of the loose parts together.  The story is so loose that they're like the molecules of gas, not compressed nor intact.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOn the bright side, the art is amazing, the way they incorporate the clothes to the character, the characters hair styles and their eyes just look wonderful. Having hot guys will draw lots of fan girls to this anime. They're just so gorgeous but then again those hot guys won't be enough to save this anime from its downfall. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo tell you the truth, I didn't enjoyed ths at all. I regreted watching and finishing this series hoping that something legit will happen and save this anime from its downfall but nothing happened. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to make your brain bleed from all the confusion , go ahead ! Try watching this! Try wasting  12 hours of your life into watching this.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS but not really major ones but you have been warned \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nI thought the story was well done for this kind of anime (although it could've been a lot better). It follows a girl who has lost her memories and time seems to go back to August 1st to a world that she has no memories of of course dating a different guy every time. I don't know if it's just me but I didn't find it confusing at all - it was actually quite predictable. The story itself was much more based on the actual storyline rather thanthe dating and romance side which is unusual for an otome game adaptation. After the first few episodes, I got a grasp of what's happening and that made it fairly easy to predict.\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art was very good and along with the story, is the best point of this anime. What was particularly nice was the character design. (I don't know why but for some reason the eyes were really off in most characters and that annoyed me which is why it isn't 8/10)\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nThe sound is like the anime overall - it had some good parts and bad parts but was all in all average and nothing really stood out for good or bad reasons\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nAlright this was the horrible point of this anime - The heroine who is unnamed throughout the series is dull, stupid and naive. Even after repeating the same thing over and over again, she never seems to learn anything and the creatrs seem to have just given up on her halfway. She also never seems to be able to stand up for herself or say 'no' to anyone.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nNow, the enjoyment would've been higher if they had made the heroine better. She seemed to take all the potentially good parts out of it. As the story progressed, it dropped more and more clues (that were obvious in my opinion). Although it was all summed up on the last 2 episodes, I think that only the heroine didn't have any idea of what's going on.\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is not good or bad and the anime has the same number of bad points as good points.",

            "content": "I am trying to think of the nicest way to put my review, but I find myself stuck on the fact the first episode of Amnesia drew me in, only to have the latter episodes highly disappoint me in the way it was executed. I mean, the art work is great, the plot premise is interesting as are the various characters. However, the more I watched the Anime the more I was reminded of Twilight. \r\nI'm not saying here that the character is a Mary Sue. She's honestly got enough fatal flaws going on and the scenario is believable. The characters can be related toa lot easier then with the Twilight saga, but the poor pacing was there through the entire thing. I think that honestly was the main thing that killed it for me, the fact that the pacing was horrible. That, and we didn't get to meet the characters as much as we could have.\\n\\n\r\nTo much just dragged on and on. There were periods of silence. By that I don't mean no sound, but places where no action happens, nothing happens. Said places could have been filled in with more character development, more hints, but on the flip side there wouldn't have been as much confusion for the plot line. Don't get me wrong here. I'm not saying that the material can't be confusing for the viewer, but you really should wrap it up somewhat towards the end. Of course, the mysterious aspect where you toss things at the various readers can also be one of the hardest to pull off.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly don't think that whoever put the Anime together knew exactly what they were doing. I say Anime and not the otome game because I haven't played it and my review shouldn't be taken as a reflection on the game, though if the game is actually good, it's a major shame the Anime didn't do it any justice and may instead have tarnished its reputation. And no... it being an adaptation off an Otome doesn't excuse the poor pacing either. There were to many things I felt could have been edited and there are good adaptations off Otome.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the characterization. Don't get me wrong here, I liked the characters a lot. It felt like we barely got to meet them. In a way this is another way that it felt like Twilight. It felt like you were meant to self insert yourself as the main character and feel what she felt as you were going along, but the way the characters were barely touched upon made it feel like... I think the best way to put it is, in an Otome game you are able to make the choices, but in the Anime all the choices were made for you. You weren't able to explore and discover things. It's almost as if they tried to hard to capture the \u201cessence\u201d of an Otome game, forgetting that we're dealing with two different mediums here.\\n\\n\r\nIn the long run, I wanted a WHOLE lot more then what I got out of it and I felt the people plotting out the story line did a very bad job, which pretty much took every other persons work, the animators, the sound technicians, the voice actors hard work and pretty much threw it into the trash.",

            "content": "Amnesia is a story about a nameless female protagonist who travels to different worlds in order to recover her lost memories and also to find out more about the people around her and about herself.\r\nIn response to what most reviewers who gave Amnesia low scores, I decided to watch it. I wanted to watch it for the reason that I could prove to those people that this deserves at least an average score. \r\nSadly, I didn\u2019t feel it myself, too. There was nothing. There was no spark. As I was on episode 3, things started to get messy. I wanted to drop it as soonas possible. Still, I wanted to finish it, hoping to find some good parts. But, to no avail, I just had my hopes crashing down. \\n\\n\r\nStory: (2/10)\\n\r\nStory? As much as Amnesia has one, just forget about it. It was confusing. For me, all I witnessed was the protagonist\u2019s desire and sickening thirst for almost all the male characters in the story. Imaginatively, if I may add.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that really got to me, to the point of actually wanting to stop myself from watching this, was the cards. It had no connection whatsoever to the story. They added it not knowing it would just mislead the viewers even more, trying to make them think that those cards would make sense in the end. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, as much as I love to solve mysteries, the mystery here isn\u2019t worth solving. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the story that is out of order, or because it just can\u2019t be solved.\\n\\n\r\nKento\u2019s part of the story, which for me was probably the best and sweetest part of the whole series, only lasted for one episode. It was disappointing. And just as I was about to start to like it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what\u2019s the deal with its ending? Where is the protagonist\u2019s real world? What\u2019s it like? Why the hell would they leave it unseen and unexplained?\\n\\n\r\nArt: (7/10)\\n\r\nRegarding the animation, although it had bad parts where it didn\u2019t feel right, it counterweighed almost all the negative parts of this anime. It didn\u2019t deserve the amazing opening and ending animation it had. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (5/10)\\n\r\nThe opening theme \u2018Zoetrope\u2019 by Nagi Yanagi was good. It really complimented the opening animation. The same goes for the ending theme \u2018Recall\u2019 by Ray. And the soundtrack also consisted some good music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (2/10)\\n\r\nThe main character, is very unlikeable, and is not, I repeat, IS NOT compatible with any of the male leads. None of them. There was also no good quality you\u2019ll see from her. I would like to blame her loss of memories for it, but it just made her even less interesting. \\n\\n\r\nUkyo. His story kind of reminds me of Homura\u2019s story (from Puella Magi Madoka Magica), where she tries to save Madoka from dying plenty of times, only making her condition even worse. \\n\\n\r\nA likeable character? Just Kento. \\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, what the deal with Orion anyway? He was useless. He didn\u2019t give enough justice to the series, or even complimented the main protagonist herself. And Lord Neil is no better. Both were practically insignificant.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (1/10)\\n\r\nWith an annoying and infuriating female lead, a bunch of awfully weird-dressed guys, extremely bitchy and horrible female antagonists, non-important side characters, a mystery not worth solving, a story lacking sequence, and an unclear ending, I don\u2019t think the word \u2018enjoyment\u2019 could be applied to this anime. Nuffsaid~\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (3/10)\\n\r\nTo watch Amnesia is up to a viewer. Don\u2019t judge an anime by its opening theme because as much as that was very appealing, you wouldn\u2019t get the satisfaction you\u2019re after. Amnesia is just another anime ready to be criticized. \\n",

            "content": "Amnesia is what I would call a big and utter disappointment. \r\nLet\u00b4s start with the story: As I began watching the first episodes I have to admit I quite liked it. Mistery was palpable and even though you had no idea of what was going on, the frustration and anticipation you got out of it was very enjoyable. BUT, as the story continued and the romantic interests changed but the \"what the hell is going on\" feeling didn\u00b4t, the enjoyable frustration quickly turned into mere annoyance. Everything happened so fast and so slow at the same time that getting a pleasurable feeling out of itwas almost impossible. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was impeccable, absolutely beautiful and easy on the eye, this is what really made the series worth watching. All of the male main characters were just lovely especially their colorful bright eyes. Outstanding work indeed. \\n\\n\r\nThe main male characters, although predictable, were absolutely to fall in love with; but the Heroine was just a pain! She was the typical oh so innocent type of girl with absolutely nothing to say and with a personality that can be described only as annoying. \\n\\n\r\nI really believe that the series would have been much better if it hadn\u00b4t been so rushed. It honestly had so much potential, but in the end it just let me down. The finale made me feel anything but unsatisfied, more episodes were  fundamental for it to be a great anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I didn\u00b4t hate it at all, it had its enjoyable parts and I recommend you to watch it in order to form your own opinion, as all things in life, it does have its pros, and if you like really light reverse harem (with almost no romance) you\u00b4ll enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review, I hope you find it useful. Feel free leave your comments and feedback :)",

She's totally confused and does not know what's going on. Beside her, lays a spirit named Orion. He states that it's his fault that she lost her memories. Orion said that she will travel to different worlds and one of the them will supposedly the ''real'' world. Heroine keeps traveling back to August 1st after a couple of days. And that happens continuously. The storyline is full of mystery, but I feel like the Heroine could of at least try to find out alittle bit about herself... Check her phone for family members.. her ID.. something like that.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: The art is really nice. Their eyes are really beautiful. But I feel like the boys' outfits can be a bit more..hmm, I don't know. I just don't like their outfits designs...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall 7/10: The mystery and suspension of this anime is what made me keep watching it. I honestly almost dropped this after the first 2 or 3 episodes. The one thing that I kind of hate is that the Heroine is weak and clueless. She could at least try to find out what's going on, instead of being scared and surprised every time.. But overall, I enjoy this anime. It's not of the best, but good enough for me to continue watching.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a fan of mystery and reverse harem... then this is for you. But if you easily drop anime that are slow plotted and you really hate weak/clueless protagonists.. then I wouldn't recommend this.\\n",

Really cool artwork, the characters each have two different colored eyes and all the character are attractive.\r\nThe Bad: The main female character is extremely boring and dull. I sit in front of the tv and just pray for her to do or say something interesting. Themale characters are semi interesting so far. The plot is confusing. Also the opening and closing themes are nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show is alright.",

            "content": "Hello folks~! Gongju Lee here!\r\nI don't express my anime opinions openly usually, but Amnesia is one such anime that I cannot resist the urge to express my experience and thus provide a review of this anime. I'll try to break it down in categories of relevance, like story, art, character development and overall personal enjoyment. So without further ado, let's get started shall we?\r\n~*~*~*~*~*~*~\r\nART:\r\nIt's bloody stunning. Seriously, the BEST thing about Amnesia IS THE ARTWORK. It was the gateway way to making me want to watch the series in the first place. The opening scene alone is just a great big dose of eye candyof bishounen and all the otherworldly \"Alice-in-wonderland\" card type scenario you can feast on. However, what's more impressive is definitely the interesting character design for the main characters. Each one is uniquely different from the others, but still run in the same card suit-type theme. It's very creative and still useful, because you can use it as a fallback if you have a hard time remembering who is who in this lovely reverse-harem. Also the coloring is BEAUTIFUL! It's definitely one of the consistent contents of Amnesia that I thoroughly enjoyed, episode to episode and was a driving force that kept me watching. I mean, did you guys look into those colorful bishounen's eyes? \\n\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC:\\n\r\nThe opening theme is definitely by far the best thing going for the soundtrack for this anime. I usually pride myself appreciating anime BG music, (i use them to listen as I study or to fall asleep to) but, sadly, the soundtrack to Amnesia is nothing too special. It's not bad by far, but it's not outstanding either. It does have it's share of 'sentimental' and 'emotional' background music that works well with the respective scenes, but for the most part, the soundtrack is forgettable but like I said, the opening theme is definitely a win point.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nThis story is soooooo confusing and soooooo hard to follow. It literally jumps from one moment to the next and the transitions are so choppy, it's difficult to know when you've moved on to another scene or another part of the story all together. And also speaking of story, there's not really much story development going on at ALL for the like 10 episodes! And it's a 12 episode series!! I understand it's a reverse-harem, but it seemed like the focus of the story was more about the heroine trying to recover from her amnesia than with the relationship with the respective guys. And with that said, it should NOT have taken so long to actually develop the \"story plot\" of the series. I think because it was done in that manner everything was just rushed...and truthfully left you more confused than where you started in the beginning of the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nOk. Let me get this out the way. I'm gonna break these characters down as gently and nicely as I can: THEY ARE ONE DIMENSIONAL AS THEY CAN GET.\\n\\n\r\nThe Herorine: MY GOD, she could not be any more bland. She's too submissive! She let's the other male guys push her around or boss her around or bloody just does the weirdest worst things to her, and she just takes it like, 'oh, it's okay. as long as you're happy.' It's disgusting. She doesn't think actively for herself to which results to her making way too many stupid decisions. And this woman only has two ranges of emotions: confusion and worry. I know it's based of a visual novel, so I, as a female viewer, am suppose to easily place myself in her shoes and pretend that all those lusty, desirable things the bishounen saying to her are meant for me. However that is simply not good enough. She doesn't really develop over the series and just remains this shy, submissive, emotional-less character that just doesn't make me feel empathy for her or her struggles throughout the series. It's kind of sad.\\n\\n\r\nShin: He's the tsundere and does tsudere things.\\n\\n\r\nToma: He's yandere and does yandere things.\\n\\n\r\nIkki: He's just the playboy who is misunderstood.\\n\\n\r\nKent: The smart one.\\n\\n\r\nUkyo: The weird one but weird for an important reason.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much how the series played those characters up. The only reason why I reamed the main female character so much, is that she's suppose to be the main character, the one I care most about, but in the end, she's always outshine and out-empathized by the main male suitors around her. The development of their characters, as one dimensional as they are, was just that much more defined to provoke those kind of emotions out of the viewers but unfortunately not for her.\\n\r\nFortunately, the characters do look pretty, but if you're looking for anything past the cover of those pretty books, you'll be sorely disappointed. The characters of Amnesia, ultimately are: bland and predictable but can provoke a good emotional moments that really holds you in and keeps you around long enough for the next episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nAs many bad things as I've said about it, I honestly enjoyed watching Amnesia. I think it could have been so much better than what it was. It left me in want because they ended up rushing the development of the story plot to like pretty much the last two episodes, that I wanted to experience more now that I had a better understanding of what the hell was going on. The art was simply BEAUTIFUL. I can't express that enough!! I already saw the art on merchandising and the visual game, and I though that the anime would bring that amazing quality down, but not at all. The anime was able to retain that beautiful artwork in the color and environment. Truly, a captivating sight. However, Amnesia definitely suffered more negatives than positives. The story was lost for ages, the characters were one dimensional, so much so it was almost annoying at one point, and the heroine is completely emotional-less and my issues with that characters are so great I just don't want to talk about her anymore. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAmnesia is a decent reverse harem, especially one with beautiful art, color and environment, story is pretty much lacking in developing in a timely matter, the pacing is slow and the transitions are hard to follow. But despite the negatives overpowering the good, I still enjoyed it but unfortunately it left me wanting more...in a bad way...which in the end may be worse than not liking it at all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL RATING: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is BLOODY CAPTIVATING: 3\\n\r\nThe on and off emotional moments that capture the viewer: 1\\n\r\nThe opening theme song is pretty catchy and saving grace of the OST.",

It's kinda confusing watching an anime and when you finally understand what's going on, they confuse you all over again. This happened every single time the heroine was switched from dimension to dimension. Then, the last time she switches everything makes sense.  \r\nThe characters aren't the best thing either, since their stories change all the time and it's hard to tell who they really are at some pointsin the story. It's a little difficult to understand the plot, but the anime is still a good one, in my opinion.\\n",

The story is interesting because it is mixed of time travel adventure. The main protagonist & antagonist are traveling to a different world line. I respect people's review why they hate this anime because of the final episode. I think they didn't know some of otome games. You have to analyze why this anime didn't show the chosen route of the heroine. It is made only 12 episodes. Books or mangas tell you the story. Anime series or moviemake you watch it; and Games make you become part of it. If you want to choose a husbando or boyfriend of the heroine, I highly recommend to play Amnesia: Memories game. It has a better story and the length of each story's route is very good than the anime series. And you can choose your final husbando/boyfriend it depends how you answer of each guys in their route. Anyway, I still love this anime series. If you will ask me, I want Kent and Ukyo's route hahahah! I wish to have Waka and Orion's route too LOLZ.",

            "content": "Amnesia seems like a pretty polarizing anime; so hopefully my perspective will be of some use.\r\nI fully understand why some people don't like this anime.  It might come off as your typical reverse harem girl fantasy.  Although, to be quite frank, there are plenty of far more annoyingly hyper-sexual harem boy fantasies out there. Either way, I understand why the reverse harem aspect causes it to lose some appeal.\r\nDespite that, Amnesia is a genuinely good anime.  Is it the best anime ever? No. Does it have its flaws? Yes. But it is good.\r\nFor one, the art in Amnesia is one of itsmost enticing features.  The bright colors and unique fashions really put the viewer in another realm. \\n\r\nFurthermore, these male characters aren't flat, one dimensional beings who only exist to fawn after the woman. If anyone is one dimensional, it is the leading lady (she comes off as a little bit lifeless). A major part of the story is discovering the man beyond appearances. These characters are dynamic individuals. They are genuinely interesting.\\n\r\nLastly, I mainly watched this show for its story line, not the cute boys (although, they were a bonus). \\n\r\nEvery step of this story had me curious and interested.  The viewer may be disoriented at first. The story line is a little confusing as it deals with multi-dimensional travel.  But, that's part of what draws you in. Eventually, when you piece it all together, the whole confusing bit is more than worth while and comes off as a mystery rather than poor story telling.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Amnesia is a colorful adventure with a relevant message: Remember that every \"cute boy\" is only human and not everything is as it seems.",

            "content": "I haven't liked a shojo anime in a very long time and decided that I should try i out again. I'm very pleased that I watched Amnesia, and researched it before deciding to drop it or not. If you didn't know, this anime is based off of a dating sim video game for the PSP. With that in mind, I felt they did a great job with transitions that are like he video game genre. I felt a times, I was actually playing the game. These ratings are based on the fact that I'm getting back into shojo, as well as how hard it isto go from video game to anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe concept is clear in the beginning. Introduction to Heroine and how she doesn't remember anything, but as the episodes keeps going, the plot gets muddy and frustrating. I can tell you that I have five theories on why this was happening to her and it kept me watching. Going out of the anime category, I'm a giant fan of Doctor Who and Supernatural, so Amnesia's plot line was beautiful in it's own little way. There were obvious themes that are presented in shojo anime that I've seen hundreds of times, but the complete idea of why all of the cheesey romance is worth it all. The last episode was a bit disappointing and thought it would be interesting if there was an episode for each relationship with a male character. I give it a 8 simply because I didn't feel like it was \"finished\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I had that some of the choices of how long the male characters were projected. I tend to like this kind of artistic style with the long arms and legs but I thought a few scenes were a bit too much. It honestly didn't hurt since I give it a 10. I loved the clothing and hair, as well as the backgrounds. I kept looking at how beautiful the pupils were as well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song hooked me instantly on episode one. I wasn't expecting to watch more than an episode or two, since the summary of it seemed a bit cheesey. But when the hook started, I was sold. I didn't think of the anime as a shojo frilly anime anymore but as a hardcore rip-your-heart-out tale. The voices are exactly like the ones in the video game, or wikipedia has failed me. Having voice actors for the video game also do the anime is a hard thing to do and I love knowing if I want the game, the voices will all be the same.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI decided to give this a 9 because I was waiting for the main character to develop more at the very end. I love how kind she is, even with Toma, although I frown upon her reasoning. The main character is -yes- bland but most dating game heroines are, also, she lost her memories. Memories are the reason why we react to things like we do, and giving us a bland heroine is acceptable, especially in this plot. The males all had obvious tropes. The childhood best friend, the rebel type, the socially inept, and the ladies man. I felt the male characters grew a bit more as \"their\" episode ended, which only kept me afraid of going to the next one. At the end, I didn't know which one I would \"want\" our Heroine to stay with and if they included an episode for each relationship/pairing, it would have been fantastic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI rated this a 10 because it's a breath of fresh air. I don't tend to like anime with cliche tropes but the way this anime built up the ending is worth it. I enjoyed every moment in this anime, up to the very end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I rate Amnesia a 9 for it's obvious trope characters with an interesting plot. I recommend this anime to anyone who likes a bit of timey wimey without an extreme complicated 100+ episode count. It's a fun anime with a whole bunch of feels.",

            "content": "Personally, I'm surprised by the low ratings because this is one of my favorite anime series of all time, next to Kuroshitsuji, Kamisama Hajimemashita, and a few others. I personally don't play otomes, so I don't know the origins of Amnesia.\r\nHowever, I think this anime is one worth watching because each episode leaves you at a cliffhanger, making you want MORE. People are often irritated because the anime can in fact be confusing until the last few episodes, however I believe this adds to the suspense of the show. Once the pieces fit together near the end of the series, I knew I was definitelygoing to watch this series over and over again. Watching the series before it made sense and watching the series after it makes sense makes the show twice as enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAmnesia is a reverse harem with four guys, and each has a few episodes devoted to their romance (although the romance is kept to a minimum, it keeps you wanting more). The show itself is exceptionally mysterious, which personally, I adore in any type of film.\\n\\n\r\nRatings:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8 -  I can imagine one can easily get lost if not paying attention.\\n\r\nArt: 10 - The art is outstanding, especially each character's eyes.\\n\r\nSound: 9 - The quaint music adds to the suspense which I LOVE.\\n\r\nCharacter: 6 - The only reason this deserved a low rating is because the series was only 12 episodes, so it was hard to develop all of the characters thoroughly, especially in relation to the heroine. Personally, I believe Kent's character was the weakest. If the series had 24 episodes or more, I believe the characters would have been developed much better, and the anime would have thrived more.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 - Once again, it's one of my favorite anime because of its mystery and suspense; you really have to think in order to completely understand what's going on. Additionally, I like having a little light romance. If you're looking for a purely romantic anime this may not be the anime for you.\\n\r\nOverall: 10- I know that I didn't rate every aspect of this anime as a 10, but I honestly believe it is an outstanding masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nWhether or not you like this anime really just depends on the type of person you are. I like watching shows that have some psychological/mysterious aspect, along with some romance, and that's exactly what Amnesia is.\\n\\n\r\nI'm just beginning to rewatch the series for the third time.",

            "content": "Story : 3\r\nConsidering that this anime is based off an otome game, it isn't surprising that the story isn't executed very well. \r\n You are instantly introduced to a girl who has no idea what's going on and neither does the viewer. It was a nice concept that could've had more potential - nearing further towards mystery elements than romance, but only near the end. Also, it took me a while to understand what was actually going on.\r\n It was only until near the latter half of the anime that I understood the concept. Perhaps that was their intention, but it felt quite poor. Maybeit was the fact that the anime was condensed into 12 episodes. For example, world's would shift just after 2 or 3 episodes or so, without going into enough depth about characters and each world gave you little hints -but didn't feel very intriguing. It felt like a missed opportunity to create some golden character development to the cluster of shallow characters in the anime. Although there were some obvious attempts, it felt poorly executed and rarely changed my perceptions of the characters.  And the logic in the anime was so frustrating at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9\\n\r\nMaybe I'm being too generous, but the only reason I watched the anime is for it's soothingly vibrant art style. The colours used were quite pastel-esque but there were some moments where bolder colours were used. Landscapes were quite general at times, however the quality of the art wasn't tainted. Perhaps the characters stood out a bit too much and was over the top - but it's not too much of a hindrance to the anime. However, I noticed that they've overused facets of characters outfits, perhaps to show that they're like all main characters or something, or to follow the card theme throughout the anime? For example,quite a few characters had a checkered patterns on a piece of clothing, lacking originality. This bit is subjective though. You'll know what you think when you see it.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8\\n\r\nOnce again, perhaps it's originating from my music tastes, but the music not only demonstrated the multitude of emotions throughout the show, but were also so catchy and memorable! (Namely the opening) I still have the opening and ending tune in my head to this day. It helped create scenes which, without decent music I would've probably skipped, although some songs were quite forgettable. Yet again, this is all mostly opinion based.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nDespite the lovely sound and art styles, the main character was so dull, and we barely see any of her personality shine through. Her dialogue was monotonous and made her quite forgettable - luckily her character's design was splendid, however I'd prefer if the tables turned, because it was painful to watch the amount of time's she said 'um' etc.  (Except for her shoes, them shoes were lethal)\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, others may find those character types quite intriguing, so if you enjoy shy characters who aren't very dominant then you will like the protagonist. I have to admit, she's not a bad character, just a boring one.\\n\\n\r\nThe guys and practically everyone in the anime had interesting art designs. Perhaps a bit too colourful and mystical, but it was aesthetically pleasing to watch. Then again, clothing and characters are all subjective things, so characters are mainly down to you - however there's barely any depth to the characters in the story. And as soon as you start to become attached to one of them, their arc is over and you rarely see them in much detail again. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nDepsite it's poorly executed story and monotonous personalities, I got too much enjoyment out of the art style and music. The second half of the anime is much more enjoyable and I understood more of the story. Not once did I skip the opening, and not once did I feel like the music was ridiculously out of place - which is a good thing. The opening is also relevant to the anime, emphasising the mystery feel to it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nIf you're into anime which doesn't go into too much depth, has some patience and enjoys  mystery aspects of anime, with visually pleasing characters, music and landscapes, then this anime is very much for you. (Especially if you are into otome games.)\\n\\n\r\nEven if you don't like it - give it a go. The story isn't anything groundbreaking but it might amuse you how many time's the girl says 'um'. (she doesn't even have a name - I just realised this. Probably because it's based off an otome game)\\n\\n\r\nThanks! \\n",

            "content": "Move over Bachelorette, because Amnesia has something a whole lot better and with a twist! \r\nPlot/Setting: \r\nI'm going to say straight up that I was severely confused 90% of the time. But there is a reason behind this, and don't start saying this show sucks because of it. It's quite interesting. Think of this as a third person limited POV or a first person POV story, we are only in one person's head: Heroine, and whatever is happening around her, we'll get the same reaction: confusion. I mean what else do you feel when you get amnesia? We don't understand everything is going on becausewe aren't in the other character's heads. So all of those jumps, plot holes, etc. is all because of being inside Heroine's head. It's jumbled, confused, and very fuzzy. Nothing more. Just think about that when you watch it. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting is a bit strange. The synopsis says fictional place, fiction time, etc. But is it really? There is a sense of realism, but also a dreamscape. It has this Alice in Wonderland feeling too it with the confusion. And leads me to several questions: Was this just a dream? Or a trick of the mind? An illusion? Or is there something deeper going on in Heroine's head. The creator's of this story did a great job putting some sort of mental illusion into the watchers head and making us think of these psychological possibilities. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nVery colourful. If someone was high, this would be the colours they'd see. The eyes did do it for me. They were strange, unnatural, and just plain disturbing. However, the animation was, as usual, very clear, but seriously can someone please do something about these character's choice in clothing! \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe music was fantastic! A very catchy opening and some very good background music. However, the voice of the character's were horrible. I started watching in dubbed and switched over to subbed half-way though because I couldn't take it! And even then, it was still horrible. The voices barely had emotion to them and often were very boring and monotonous. There was no passion in the actors that played them. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this was very interesting, and like I said in the plot, very Alice in Wonderland. Heroine is like Alice, confused and disoriented. But she didn't have a lot of emotion to her. She didn't react to things other people would react to. She was very static. Orion is like the Cheshire Cat. He's there to guide Heroine's way by not telling her everything that will happen. The rest of the male characters ranged from Queen of Hearts to the Mad Hatter. They were all psychos. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters did seem to have hints of several mental illnesses. There was Amnesia (obviously), Schizophrenic psychosis, Multiple Personality Disorder, Obsession Compulsive Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and a few more others. This not only created something totally brand new, but it showed what people could act like with these illnesses. Very interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\\n\r\nI'll be in the list of the people who gives this a relatively high rating because I'm thinking out of the box and away from what I saw  obvious in this show. I wasn't all that into it though and found my confusion leading to boredom very quickly. There was no tension, no suspense, and I often found myself predicting what would happen and being right. Everything was too predicable. However, this is based off a  VIDEO GAME, not a manga, so I have to give the creator's credit for doing something a lot of people don't do despite not creating a great plot.  This show is hard to understand and the viewers really have to over think what is going on, what we are seeing, and why we are seeing it through this perspective. What does it all mean? I'm going to say this to everyone who watches it: Be prepared to  get confused. But remember it's all for a reason. \\n\\n\r\nI give this show a C or a 64% on the what-did-I-just-watch scale.",

During the months of it's airing, I eagerly anticipated each episode as they came.\r\nOh, and it also has the most EPIC OP song. Love it.\r\nThe storyline can seem a little confusing to some - however I don't find this to be the case, as I read a review of the otome game (that the anime was based on) before viewing. It didn't give too much away, but I did have some kind of idea wherethe anime was headed, although the ending was a little surprising... :3\\n\\n\r\nThe one small downside I can possibly think of (personally, anyhow) is that the Heroine is very. VERY. QUIET. She isn't exactly your most headstrong heroine in the anime universe. I say give her a chance - she just got *SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER* and now has amnesia, I really think people should give her a break.\\n\\n\r\nI'd class this as a typical reverse-harem shoujo, but it's far from your typical clich\u00e9 shoujo anime. Guys might like to give it a go - if any of them are into that kind of thing... :/\\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked: Beautiful artwork and animation, five of the hottest anime guys I've ever laid eyes on, gripping entertainment, and an OP I actually sit through without opening another window tab.

But it tried, and that's what matters, right?\r\nHeroine, since we don't find out her true name, faints, and when she wakes up, is being watched, or cared for by Orion.\r\nToma and Shin, who she assumes are friends of hers, come and pick her up to walk her home.\r\nAs themales of the series are introduced along with the female staff members, you notice they're all different. They dress fancy, very individual styling. With really colourful eyes and features on their clothing. It's a nice art style, but it can feel a little out of place at some points with Heroine not being so prominent looking.\\n\r\nOne thing is for sure, the males are very handsome and easy to swoon over.\\n\r\nIn each route there is one constant appearance; Ukyo. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, it feels a little dull. There's not much to learn about somebody in the beginning who has no memories. But as it continues, things start triggering small memories.\\n\r\nIt can get a little monotonous, the routes restarting and Heroine learning about herself, and others. But it does keep some interest.\\n\r\nWhen you get to the end, the flow of the routes changing starts to feel normal and the story is coming together. It's definitely a season where you need to sit through 90% of it until it starts flowing properly and makes it worth watching. \\n\r\nThe last 2 episodes are what makes the whole season worth it.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end you're left with some questions, which is kind of annoying, but since there's so many possibilities it's understandable.",

If you've played Ukyo's path before, it explains the whole world transferring thing in more detail, and the circumstances which led to those events, while the anime just gives you a generalization of some of the the key revelations, that you should already know from playing the game. all of the original voice cast from the game reprise their roles for the anime, so that's another treat for those who have played the game. however, this anime has a dub, which is strange because the original game didn't even have English voice acting, only Japanese. the dub is sub par at best anyways, so I highly recommend you stick to subs if your planning to watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\n all in all, if your watching this anime after playing the game, I believe you will enjoy it. but if you're going into this anime having no prior knowledge of any of the games routes, you will definitely hate it, as most of the negative reviews on this page with attest to.",

I haven't played any dating simulation game but this anime gave me a very good \"view\" into the game. Im actually very interested in playing it now.\r\nIn most reverse harem manga/anime, I always tend to have some sort of dissatisfaction regarding the main male character, in this case, Ukyo's sacrifice really touched me and his willingness to endure so much pain and suffering really proved that he has the greatest love for the girl. I'mreally glad that (spoiler alert) he's the main character's true and original bf. Its pretty obvious that the girl will pick Ukyo's world (or at least, thats what it seemed to me), my only wish is to have another episode just to see them happy together and to see how the main character acts when she have her memories with her.\\n\\n\r\nThough there were boring and dull moments in this anime it had a really nice ending. I think that a decent story, though with stereotype characters, and yet had a good twist and ending, deserves a 7 noh?",

            "content": "Ok first off, the over all consensus in the reviews before this are the heroine sucks. And ya know what, she does, but she's not AS bad as some people made her out to be.\r\nSecond, this review is a rating of the anime as a whole for it's genre not necessarily for an anime in and of itself seeing as shounen and shoujo are not the same, I don't know why the rating wouldn't be based on the genre or what the anime is setting itself up as.\r\nAnd lastly, I've watched the entire thing. Many people who wrote bad reviews didn't watch the full series,so honestly, I'd pay attention to those who've seen it all the way through, because believe it or not, it's more then just hot bishies and a wooden heroine.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nThe story is mediocre at first, but when you think about it, the idea kinda works. At least for the purposes of an Otome game (in which this series is based off of) it makes more sense then the whole \"All these guys love me and I don't know who to chose. Oh darn\" and fixes that dilemma in a simple yet kinda brilliant way, again for an Otome game. However this also becomes a little bit of a downfall because of how that plot that allows the simplistic brilliance (again, for an Otome game) drives the MC down to possibly the most boring heroine I've ever encountered. All that aside, I wrote part of this review only watching up to episode 7, but after that ... well the story gets quite a bit better, hence the higher rating. Also,------ Mild Spoiler----\\n\r\nIt kind escalates quickly and takes a rather large turn from what you'd expect in an Otome game and/or shoujo anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Solid 9\\n\r\nAwesome actually. I know it's a bunch of bishies and a wish fulfillment heroine, but really the art is fantastic for the purpose it fulfills. THE EYES is really all I can say. I love their design, unique, yet still akin to the whole anime style. Each one is totally unique too, both in colors and in design (such as the outline/eyelash styles) I really enjoyed seeing new characters just to see what their eyes looked like. This is not to say it's the best art ever in the history of anime, because it's not, but for the purpose it's designed as, it does the best job of any anime in its class.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nEveryone seems to love the OP but I for some reason liked the ED more. For me, sound is not much of a maker or deal breaker beyond what I hear in the intense or happy or sad (if their are any) scenes in anime. With that, the sound during the show didn't really catch my attention, but it also didn't feel out of place. I mostly didn't notice it. But for what it is, the OP and ED are really pretty awesome in themselves.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6 and half way through, it goes more to a 7.\\n\r\nThis is where the anime falls drastically short. Whether for time constraints or just Otome games in general, the character, specifically of the heroine is totally lacking. To get it out of the way, let's review the Heroine who couldn't be more aptly named. So she's lost her memories and personality decided to jump ship along with it. Given the story line though of HOW she lost her memories, I suppose this could explain why more then her memories went with her. However, when that part of the plot is revealed (pretty early on in the show too) they never say that's also why her personality is that of a wet match trying to light a damp piece of wood. It just doesn't work, nor make sense. That being said however there WERE times she said no, stood up for herself or questioned things. Sure, it's not much, but she wasn't totally submissive when the guys were all up on her, she definitely tried to run or push them away or said no. She's too quiet though and given how everyone says she was before, it's just more proof that her personality for some reason went out the window. Also, just a few small but prominent tripes, what is up with her outift and her hair? She never changes it and honestly it doesn't fit either the lack of personality nor what seemed to be her previous personality. I know some think it's cute, I just think it felt out of place. Especially her hair. Just wear it normally please, why one braid and one rosebud and bangs with shoulder length? That would look stupid in real life and it looks stupid here.\\n\r\n----Mild spoiler alert----\\n\r\nThe guys start out having cliche personalities, the mathwiz who views everything as a calculation (we totally never see that in anime) the playful fun but caring guy (I've just never seen that before) the lone wolf and the popular guy. However, this isn't totally what it seems (except the lone wolf, he had about the least character of any of the guys) The popular one actually has some story as to why he's popular and how he also feels about being popular. The math guy is not as cold hearted and as calculating as all characters with the genius trait tend to be, in fact he was probably me favorite and even made me go \"Dawww\" at times. And his route (how that works is a spoiler, so you can just sit there and be confused as to how that works in the anime) is only one ep long. WTF? Both the popular and the lone wolf guy and the playful guy get 2-3 eps for their routes, why the hell does in my opinion the best guy get the shortest time? That really rustled my jimmies. Meh. The playful guy (who's blonde, because all playful fun people are blonde, right? And no, this isn't a spoiler, because just looking at him and you already know his stereotype) however he's quite a bit more then that if not a little too much more, but since it's anime, you can see why he does what he does as it wouldn't apply in the real world at all to act that way.\\n\r\nI also liked that the manager changed personalities based on the route. His serious face all customers suck one made me LOL. \\n\r\nOrion was ok, he fit pretty well for what his character was accomplishing\\n\r\nUkyo makes the plot interesting, I'll leave it at that.\\n\r\nAlso ALL the guys have really awesome and intricate outfits that are attractive for the character and pure eye candy. My personal favorites were Kento's and Ukyo's. The girls looked smashing as well. I really liked both Hime's and Sawa's design, outfits and personalities. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI actually wanted to find out what was going on in the series, but there were times I wanted to completely forgo it and put it in the \"Never finish because it sucks\" list here on MAL, mostly because the heroine drove me nuts. STOP FREAKING FALLING. Seriously. However, the plot is actually interesting enough to make you wonder what is going on and I was no exception. Also, the math guy, I kept watching to see his route and he made the entire show more enjoyable just for that (sure, the fact that he believes and understands what is going on with the heroine is farfetched, but I suspended disbelief the minute I saw the popular guy hanging with the heroine. That said, the my enjoyment and interest escalated after episode 9, so if you can stick the series through (which honestly isn't THAT bad or that boring) you're in for a small, but nice treat. The pay off is worth it given what the anime is going for.\\n\\n\r\nOver all: 7-7.5\\n\r\nOver all, it's not too bad of a watch if you're into eye candy, rather interesting/new plot and nice art. Again, this rating is based on what the anime is trying to be and it's really not as bad as others have said, so long as you know that it's shoujo based on an Otome game and has lots of bishies and a plain boring wish-fulfillment heroine who's personality decided to call itself dead, because it killed it. That aside, give it a watch if you like pretty boys and have already seen Ouran High School Host Club (parody/comedy) or Yamato Nadeshiko Shichi Henge (comedy) or Brothers Conflict (srs face) which all deal with great bishies and the reverse harem trope. So in conclusion, despite its glaring flaws, it's honestly not that bad of a show. In fact, the twist kinda made me go \"well ... damn! 8O\". The ending is a bit rushed, but it seems the entire show was rushed period. At least most everything is explained though, if not all said in about 5 minutes during the last 10 minutes of the episode. Give it a shot, at worst it's mediocre and boring and at best, it's actually rather interesting and fun to watch, if not for just the art or wanting to know what goes on in the plot.",

Remember this anime was made from a game and they tried to keep the aspect of 'you get to choose' unlike other anime like 'Clannad' that follows one relationship, this tries to put them all together and give you a sort of ... 'I choose my own ending'. The main character is your typical 'RPG' type of character meaning, she has no outstanding qualities. There is nothing special about her and she is rather bland.\r\n Now the real reason I watched this show is becauseof the art and the style that they drew the 4 (5) boys. I am an art freak, although I can't draw I love good art and will enjoy it no matter what which is why I am 'okay' with giving this anime a 6 instead of the 2 it deserves. The art details the eyes to pop out at you as well as their hair that changes at the tips to their clothing which has never been seen before. \\n\\n\r\nDon't watch this show if you are looking for a great story line, this is just an anime for you to literally enjoy the looks of the 4 (5) boys in the show, they give little description about each character but I made it work and liked the guys. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion don't watch it for the story, watch it for the art.\\n",

            "content": "At first I thought I was going to like this anime. After watching the first episode, I thought the show had potential - I mean the premise was interesting after all. I wanted to know more about the Heroine and Orion. More importantly, I desperately wanted to find out what happened prior to August 1st. Did I get to find any of that out? No. Well, I did in the end, but the ride to get there was anything but enjoyable. \r\nNow I understand that Amnesia is an adaptation of an Otome game. The format for these games are as follows: you are presented withmultiple love interests, you pick one route, you complete the route, and you move on to another route. That's essentially like Amnesia, expect shorter, uninspiring, and frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the series felt rushed, but jarringly slow at the same time. What do I mean by that? \\n\\n\r\nWell, the Heroine only spends a short amount of time with each guy. Most of that time consists of trying to find out who her current boyfriend is and what she must do to pretend that nothing is wrong. There is little opportunity for the Heroine and any of the male leads to connect, and if there was it felt shallow and fulfilling. Each boyfriend the Heroine had was unmemorable. I can't remember any of their names for the life of me. That's not a good sign. The only thing those guys had going for them was their character design, which was comprised of mismatched articles of clothing, patterns, and colors. Once a key event has happened in a route, the episode ends. Seriously. Each episode has a cliffhanger, and the viewer is just left there with so many unanswered questions. In addition, the following episodes does little to answer those questions. When you think you've pieced some pieces of the story together, it all just comes to grinding halt. You are back at square one. All of a sudden, most of what you learned a few episodes ago did not matter and in fact had no significance to the overall plot and its conclusion. This lack of overall plot development is what I meant by jarringly slow. It's so slow it's like nothing happened.\\n\\n\r\nOn to character development.\\n\\n\r\nThere was little character development with the Heroine. She showed little motivation to seek the truth and would have probably done nothing if it wasn't for another character guiding, pushing, or influencing her to do something. She only redeems herself somewhat towards the end when she displays some sort of free will. Usually the protagonists in VNs have don't have too much character and/or back story. This is so that the player can live vicariously through the protagonist. When adapting a VN into an anime however, the protagonist needs to have substance. It's really hard to cheer on a character you don't care much for, or worse, are ticked off at.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the Heroine and I are suffering from Amnesia. We both don't know what's going on most of the time, but we just go with the flow in hopes that somehow this story will end.",

            "content": "I am someone who has played the source material, the otome visual novel, first. I thought that it was absolutely amazing which is why I had very high expectations going into the anime. However, the low rating and episode count on MAL concerned me, since I knew a majority of otome visual novel adaptations fail to be good due to the studio trying to condense 40+ hours of gameplay into a short episode count. Amnesia, sadly, did this mistake. \r\nStory: \r\nThe story sounds quite interesting at first, being an anime about a woman regaining her memories and uncovering the mysteries of her circumstances. The genresalso intrigued me, being josei, mystery, romance, and fantasy. Sadly, it seems the anime didn't know what to do with its plot. It initially wants to be a tale of uncovering the heroine's memories (yes she has no name) but she doesn't really uncover ANYTHING...? She occasionally gets a fragment but most of the time it doesn't do anything to progress the plot. Another thing is that alternate worlds exist in the anime, with the heroine being a certain character's girlfriend in each different world, but unlike in the visual novel, it's never explains the importance of these worlds (I will not spoil the reason they are important since it's actually very important in the game and I'm trying to keep this spoiler free). Furthermore, it seemed the anime wanted to push the \"romance\" aspect as its main focus but it ultimately fails in this. This is because when the heroine supposedly \"falls in love\" with a character in one world and gets transferred to another world and then \"falls in love\" with someone else the love never seems genuine, especially since she seems to remember events that happened in previous worlds (which does not happen in the game). The pacing is also absolutely terrible and the story is just confusing because it doesn't know what it wants to focus on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nCompared to the game, the characters were just... bland in the anime. In the visual novel, since there are multiple endings and routes, each character's pasts and personality traits are further explained and have more depth. However, in the anime, all the characters fall into typical tropes and have nothing special to them whatsoever other than their character designs. Toma is your typical nice and caring type. Shin is just a tsundere, Kent is a calculating and glasses wearing ikemen, and Ikki is a playboy. Ukyo, another bachelor for the heroine, was just a train wreck. He is supposedly the \"cannon\" interest and acts as an antagonist for the duration of the anime but his motives are never clearly explored. Ukyo is seen to have two personalities but the anime never explains why, which, again, is explained in the visual novel. Many of the plot holes involving the characters or the story are always explained in the visual novel, but as an anime, it shouldn't have to make the viewers confused and need to play the game just to find answers. Adding on, all of the love interests have only like 1-2 episodes dedicated to them, which gives me no attachment to them and know absolutely nothing about their characters to make me love them. Don't even get me started on the Amnesia heroine, she is a legit doormat and is there for the sake of self-insert. Heck, she doesn't even have a cannon name. Characters in the anime always refer to her as \"you\" which is pretty awkward. The heroine in the anime just lets the guys do whatever they want to her and her only lines of dialogue are lines such as \"um\" or \"ah.\" In the visual novel the heroine has some defining traits to her depending on the dimension she is in which makes her more interesting, an example being when she has a love for music in the heart world and is a great singer. Did I forget anyone in this anime? OH WAIT! The side characters! Completely forgettable. Sawa, Rika, Waka,Mine, and Orion only appear very few times and when I ask people if they remember any other character other than the main ones in the anime most of the time no one remembers them. Orion is supposed to guide the heroine and help her regain her memories but a lot of the times he doesn't even show up in the anime. He keeps disappearing, for again, another reason that is never explained (and it doesn't even happen in the game).\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe art was one of the only redeeming aspects of this anime. I am not an animation specialist so I cannot nitpick anything too major, but in just the eyes of an average watcher, I found the animation to be pleasing. Brain's Base did a wonderful job with the backgrounds and interpretation of Hanamura Mei's art style and I found the eye candy to be great. It was in no means perfect, but I still loved the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nAmnesia's opening theme was outstandingly good! I found the music to be catchy, and when I first watched it I was excited for the contents of the anime (to my later disappointment). Ending was also pretty good and was fitting for the ending of an episode but not quite as memorable as the opening. The background music and other soundtrack weren't quite as memorable but was pleasing to hear. Overall, sound was pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nMy ending thoughts? If you want to see some handsome bishounen then go ahead and watch, I won't judge. But if you want a riveting story then pass this anime and just play the visual novel. I said this a lot, but compared to the anime the visual novel is just better, character and story wise. This anime adaptation was an absolute mess, and I just hope for better otome game anime in the future.\\n",

            "content": "\u2606This is a spoiler-free review\u2606\r\nAmnesia was an interesting watch. \r\nTo really grasp the concept of what Amnesia is about, you first have to know where it comes from-originally, the story was developed from an otome game, or dating simulator. The main character of Amnesia, otherwise known as Heroine, is the focus of both the game and anime. \r\nStory [8]\r\nAmnesia had interesting concept for story; a girl with-you guessed it!-amnesia is lost and confused, and goes through multiple versions of her life, trying to figure out which one is real, which boy she belongs with, and which reality she can live in for the longest,with only a fairy named Orion to help her along the way. \\n\\n\r\nArt [9]\\n\\n\r\nThe art, in my opinion, was positively beautiful. I loved the vibrant colors and playing cards theme, and how it all tied together to its roots as a game.\\n\\n\r\nSound [8]\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pleasant to listen to, and the opening song becomes catchy after a while. Voice-acting was fine, nothing shabby.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [7]\\n\\n\r\nWhile, admittedly, each character was slightly bland (with only a slight bit of deeper character traits) and very obviously based off of a dating simulator's stereotypical selection of boys, it does have the Heroine develop a bit throughout the plot and throws a good twist in the end. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [8], Overall [8]\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're okay with pretty bishi boys and romance, this anime may be something that you can enjoy and experience through all twelve episodes (plus the otome game!).",

            "content": "Okay... I'm going to make TWO review parts based on two things. 1st review for those who HAVEN'T played the otome game, but want to see the anime. 2nd part for those who HAVE played the otome game, but haven't seen the anime yet.\r\n(1st -For people getting into the anime without the knowledge of the Otome)\r\nOkay, here's the deal. I watched Amnesia before I played the otome game and that was a while ago, so my views on this part might be a bit cloudy, but let me just tell you this... most of you... are going to be VERY confused with the plot. Thepremise itself is simple, you got a girl with amnesia, who doesn't know whats happening in her life or her own name (you won't get to know her name).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the actual confusing part will be that she will end up in different parallel/alternate worlds. This anime being a reverse harem, the story will revolve around her coming to know a love interest in each world with a different scenario to face. The heroine just goes about this all, not really being too alarmed by the fact that not only does she have amnesia, but she's world-hopping also. The heroine herself is somewhat monotone, rarely talks, and will lack a personality. I know some people HATE this in a MC, but this was done purposely to keep the Heroine like a blank canvas for the viewers to easily paint her as something they want or even picture themselves as her. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the Heroine doesn't go through this all alone, she'll have a young spirit guide to help her. But to be honest, besides telling the Heroine of her situation at the start, he provides zero help. He isn't seen by others, he can't even touch her or anything else around him and is mostly there for moral support... or be the shotacon of the series... xD\\n\\n\r\nBut talking about characters now, in each world, the heroine is paired up with one guy.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll see some harem tropes, especially character wise.\\n\\n\r\nWe have a tsundere who is a calm silent type.\\n\\n\r\nWe have the hot and everyone adores type.\\n\\n\r\nWe have the smart and cool type.\\n\\n\r\nWe have a big brother type.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have... a \"mysterious\" type.\\n\\n\r\nLike the MC characterization, some will be put off by some of these tropes. However, when the main character dives into each of these worlds and gets to know each guy, you'll see that each guy has a problem/scenario that you normally don't see with these kinds of characters. Some might actually surprise you.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the anime, some of you will be scratching your heads or cupping your chin theorizing what this all meant in conclusion. For me, overall my enjoyment of this anime was mixed, most downsides being that I was so confused that it prompted me to actually play the otome game to see if it would answer some burning questions I had. But the anime did have me glued to the screen in interest. I really fell in love with some of the characters and was actually upset when the Heroine jumped the next world, leaving the said character behind. So don't get too attached.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(2nd -For otome players wondering if this anime is worth the watch)' *DON'T READ THIS PART IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED THE GAME. POSSIBLE SPOILERS!*\\n\\n\r\nAfter I played the otome, a lot of things became a lot clearer that's for sure. However, I've noticed things in comparison in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime adds and doesn't include certain things.\\n\\n\r\nWith the 'adding' thing, the anime basically added plot and scenarios that don't hold true to the game. In the game, you don't swap worlds with your Heroine having the knowledge that she swaps worlds, only you as the player know this. In the anime, she ACTUALLY knows about the different worlds and casually goes through the 'get to know the guys process' without considering her past worlds and associations, despite the fact she knows of them. She basically, in a way, has as much knowledge about this as Ukyo does, excluding some facts.\\n\\n\r\nOrion isn't with the Heroine 100% of the time like he is in the game. Orion will disappear and reappear at random times, leaving the Heroine alone in different situations. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime will have a favoritism towards certain love-interests. I'm just going to flat out tell you now, that any Kent fans will most likely be disappointed. Speaking of the love interests, all of them will have their same voice actors, so you'll feel right at home about that.\\n\\n\r\nThe story progression and plot... well... since this all is in a span of 12 episodes, you see very different things in each world in the anime. Some will end abruptly, some will keep the same premise as the game's stories but end on a different note. You won't get a lot of time with the characters, and the story goes at a fast pace, to squish in as much of the game's story into a 12 episode anime. As a result, things will come off... differently. \\n\\n\r\nSo basically, to any of you who played the game, but haven't seen the anime, expect a number of changes. Some of you may not care about this, some you may be irked about it. Personally, if you are a big fan of the game and fandom overall, I'd say go for it and watch the anime. However, if you are not adapt to change, then maybe the anime isn't for you.",

The art style of the character's eyes and hair was absolutely beautiful. If you're slow to catch onto plot, this anime may be difficult for you to watch. I had no idea what on earth was going on until it was thoroughly explained (halfway through the show), and while I like mystery andslight confusion, I did NOT enjoy being this confused. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, there just wasn't enough development. Heroine spent about 2-3 episodes with each guy before dying and moving onto the next one, so it was hard to get attached to anyone before they were cast away.\\n\\n\r\nLike most anime I've seen (especially the romance ones), the show ended very abruptly with no clear vision on how the characters were going to live their lives after the show ended.

            "content": "I feel like everyone who reviewed negatively missed the real point of the anime. \r\nThis anime is clearly reverse harem, but to me the romance factor of this anime and her having multiple different boyfriends is secondary to the true plot: the multiverse theory.\r\nIf you go into this for the romance plot, it's no wonder you're disappointed, but however, to me that's secondary because it's not just a cliche romance-only anime. It's also got fantasy and a bit of science-fiction because it's an anime that surrounds the multiverse theory. \r\nThe multiverse factor is mentioned pretty early on in the series by Orion, so I don'tunderstand how it's not understood that that's the main focal point of the story: how and why this girl keeps going back to the same day over and over again without any memories of what happened before then. The mystery that surrounds this is definitely what makes this series so interesting. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not about the fact that she has multiple different boyfriends, it's about how and why she seemingly does. And the reason why she does and is seemingly stuck in a loop but with different guys in different worlds isn't truly revealed until later on. \\n\\n\r\nIt can move a little slow, but I think that's because she was instructed by Orion to, at first, not say anything to anyone, but in each world they figure it out on their own that something isn't right. \\n\\n\r\nThe girl isn't even a bad character, she's doing her best by trying to figure out what's happening to her and why with very little guidance. Show some compassion, people. Anyone with continuous amnesia, especially in these circumstances, is going to move a little slowly and be confused, awkward, and scared. And she definitely has character growth by the end. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a wah wah part in episode 9, but other than that, I think the personalities of the guys (even throughout the multiple worlds) are pretty considerate. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall explanation of what and why the stuff that happened happened, comes in the last two episodes, and it honestly ends up being pretty sad. \\n\\n\r\nIn that case, I enjoyed it and would love to watch more mystery multiverse animes.",

            "content": "I guess my review is a little bias since I am utterly obsessed with this otome game when it was released. YES this anime was based on an otome game where you play the main heroine and you get to choose a guy's route, win his heart and live happily ever after with him.\r\nWith that said, this show is definitely not for everyone and if you have not played the game I doubt you will understand this anime nor even continue to watch it because it'll just get confusing as each episode progresses. Also, I believe this anime was adopted mainly as a game franchiseto satisfy its overwhelming fans. \\n\\n\r\nAlright so MC character is supposed to be you. They didn't gave her a name in the show because in the game the person playing it names the MC as herself. I noticed some reviews were complaining about this, and although it is a little frustrating this is just how most otome games are. Deal with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe Plot is a helluva topsy turvy wtf moments but again, if you play the game, it all makes sense. I respect that they followed almost every single thing that happened in the game in each guy's route. In the game the MC is definitely bland and doesn't talk much, it's because Orion does most of the thinking for her, and her dialogue are mostly choices you pick on how to respond to the guy youre playing. It is definitely interesting how they put together all the scenes that are exactly on each of the game's route so I do commend the animators for that.\\n\\n\r\nMusic was great, the intro and the bg music are fantastic, even Ukyo's theme got me mesmerized. All the characters are on point and I'm glad they used the same voice actors as the ones they have in the game.\\n\\n\r\nMy only gripe is that they did almost two episodes for each of the guys except Kent, which only has one! where is justice on that?! and they sort of cut Orion in most of the scenes. It could have been better if he's with the MC most of the time to avoid the annoying blandness on MC's reaction each time she goes to another parallel world and restarts her amnesia.\\n\\n\r\nOKAY SO OVERALL, I definitely enjoyed this show only because I played the game and enjoyed the game to heart. BUT IF YOU ARE NOT AN AMNESIA GAME OTOME FAN, this is probably not for you or you would probably hate this so much your eyebrows will unify to one. It's confusing af so for better viewing I recommend playing the game first before indulging on the show. ^^",

To begin with, I only started watching this series years ago because my friend said that she watched a few episodes a while ago and that they were good. At the time, I watched whatever she watched, so I watched an episode. I got bored of it and put it on hold for later. Now, years later, I came back to it because I simply can't deal with dropping or putting shows on hold. Consider it acharacter flaw. Either way, I came back to it without very high hopes. \\n\\n\r\nI am a major fangirl, so it's no surprise that I play otome games. From popular ones like My Candy Love and Eldarya to ones nobody has heard of buried in someone's Deviant Art or the App Store, I've played so many that anything otome barely surprises me anymore, so I suppose I thought I was ready for this. Despite my otome addiction, until recently, most of my anime choices were considerably shonen, but I suppose that despite my love for gore and mystery and action, somewhere in the midst of it, I didn't get my fix of romance, so I found myself here. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was alright, I suppose. It starts off pretty interesting, but as it goes on, it just gradually gets worse. (SPOILER ALERT) Around about episode 9-ish, I really stopped enjoying the show. It started to drag on. And Toma? And the fucking cage? What the actual fuck? Why wasn't the heroine reacting at all? Why was she acting like a lifeless doll? Why was she trying to embrace Toma afterwards? How does she not feel anger towards him at all? I was pretty pissed about the handling of that.  At first, I was super excited because none of the arcs had turned this dark. Shin\u2019s arc had been the typical bad boy x his childhood friend arc where we was trying to be \u2018nicer\u2019 and all that shit. Ikki\u2019s had been the typical playboy x girl who doesn\u2019t fall for him right away. Kento, on the other hand, was completely different from the others, and not even that cliche. I was excited for Toma\u2019s, expecially since he\u2019d seemed to be so nice in the first episode. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe whole cage and drugs deal was definetly frightening, but it added some dark color to the anime, so I didn\u2019t mind it very much and thought it interesting, but by the time it got to the heroine FORGIVING Toma for all that shit and saying she was in love with him? Claiming that he\u2019d done all of that to \u2018protect her\u2019? And he went as far as to threaten to rape her, said that he\u2019d ignore her pain, but she just pushes all that aside and confesses her love for him? \\n\\n\r\nIn addition to this, they later show some semblance of days passing, but since the heroine looks the exact same and everyone wears the exact same clothes every single day, it\u2019s impossible to tell the difference. \\n\\n\r\nThe last few episodes take on an \u2018Another\u2019 feel, with the main character trying to avoid her death at all means possible, but knowing her survival will kill Ukyo. I find that while this plot could\u2019ve been interesting, it\u2019s completely dulled by the fact that she\u2019s completely unlovable and she makes so many stupid decisions and falls in love so easily that should already be dead. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I really liked the art. I had a problem with the outfits. While most of the characters were stunning, the way they were presented made it hard to take them seriously. They were dressed like circus performers, opposed to all the other people in the background who looked normal. Also, can I point out that the heroine has terrible fashion sense?\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, the music is phenomenal (the opening and closing themes) so I\u2019m willing to forgive some of the shitty voice acting and the unfitting background music sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, however, I can't forgive. Putting aside the cliches of most of the guys (I'm willing to exclude Kento and Ukyo because they're at least a little different, and as much as I hate to admit it, Toma is too, he's just a stereotypical rapist and stalker) the heroine was terrible. I thought I was prepared since I was so into otomes and shojos, but by god I wasn't. The heroine\u2019s entire dialogues are comprised of 90% \u201cuh\u201d, \u201cwhat\u201d, \u201chuh\u201d, \u201cyeah\u201d, and \u201cokay\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of this, she was just STUPID. Even in episode 11, after explicitly being told \u201cdont trust me\u201d and \u201cdont go near the shrine\u201d by Ukyo and suffering at the hands of his split personality, the stupid heroine goes ahead and meets him anyways, after which he tries to throw her in the well and she doesn\u2019t even struggle but instead just stands still like a doll. \\n\\n\r\nI also had a problem with how terrible and awkward the dialogue was. \\n\\n\r\nFor example: \u201cYou talked to the manager about photography. Do you take a lot of pictures?\u201d \\n\r\n\u201cYeah. You better believe it. I take a lot.\u201d is the response in monotone. \\n\\n\r\nEven worse: \u201c...I\u2019m your true love.\u201d\\n\r\n Pause. Heroine looks up. \u201cUkyo\u2026 you\u2019re my boyfriend?\u201d \\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure what strikes me as so terrible about these dialogues, but they honestly made me cringe. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I started this series, I honestly didn't understand why the ratings were so low. I had started off and even gotten to about episode 6 expecting to give the show about a rating of a 6 or 7, but as soon as it hit Toma and Ukyo's arc, it was all I could do to not give it the lowest score possible.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I would recommend this if: you like otome games, you don't mind a bland heroine, you're the type of person who doesn't like committing to loving one fictional guy, you want to try out different stereotypical guys, you want all the guys to be attracted to you, you want to watch an anime where you can just insert yourself into the story, you like bright colors and death and psychological twists \\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if: you are looking for a heroine with substance, you wanted a finality in the ending, you are looking for something to be obsessed with, you want a developing love story, you want any character development at all. \\n\\n\r\nHope you have a great day everyone! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review will include spoilers!\r\nI'll admit, Reverse Harem anime's are my guilty pleasure and every so often I watch one on a whim and I usually walk away feeling disappointed, both in the show and in myself but sometimes the feelings I'm left with are anger and disgust. \r\nAmnesia is the latter. So let's break this down. \r\nStory: 3/10 \r\nThe story is honestly one of the more disappointing aspects of this show. The premise is interesting and the caveat of the protagonist having to try and figure out which new timeline she's in in order to avoid completely messing everything up is probably better utilizedin the original game as here it simply results in her looking confused 90% of the time and being totally useless the other 10 percent. \\n\\n\r\nNone of the individual time lines are fleshed out before the protagonist invariably finds herself near death and in a new universe again. \\n\\n\r\nThere are many much better Time Travel/Alternate Universe hopping anime out there. \\n\\n\r\nThere was only really one relationship covered in the show that felt rewarding or good at all and it ends well before it reaches any sort of satisfying... well anything. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe Art is pretty but nothing to write home about, the boys are inevitably attractive enough. Really nothing to report here. The only aspect that stands out at all is that the female protagonist's design is at least marginally different from most generic otome game girls. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nAgain nothing to write home about, honestly I don't remember much of anything about the music or sound design, which can only mean it wasn't horrible enough to warrant remembering. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are bad, worse than usual reverse harem fair. Our protagonist is generic, has no personality so you can project yourself onto her, reverse Harem girl. A trope I wish, quite frankly would die. She's also useless, helpless and probably going to die by stupidity. \\n\\n\r\nThe main boys are, frankly, horrible. Only one of them (Kent) seemed to care at all about what the protagonist wanted and was willing to work with her to better their relationship and his is the shortest story line. \\n\\n\r\nThe least offensive of the remaining boys are boring at best, and irritating at worst. They include a boy with a fan club that he just lets harass main girl, in Ikki and Shin who is a childhood friend and is protective but mostly leaves our protagonist to her own devices to die by literally everything. (Unlike his older brother whom I will touch on in a moment.)\\n\\n\r\nThe other two are, well, abusive. This is a trope I see gaining lots of traction in Reverse Harem/Otome game animes and it's frankly angering and very very terrifying. These boys are never called out on it and indeed garner their own fanbases. \\n\\n\\n\r\nToma (Shin's older brother) Literally locks our protagonist in a cage, against her will, for her protection. But not before he drugs her into sleeping for two weeks straight. AND THE PROTAGONIST IS A-OKAY WITH ALL OF THIS! \\n\\n\r\nUkyo is the last of the potential love interests and unfortunately the one the anime tries to convince us is the best choice in boyfriend. Ukyo suffers from split personality disorder, that he gave himself, by dying multiple times over trying to save our protagonist. This second personality tries to kill our protagonist at literally every turn. Which is (warning, incoming sarcasm) soooo romantic. \\n\\n\r\nOrion is the only remotely interesting character and he gets sidelined so often  the show just gives up on ever doing anything with him. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIn summary: Amnesia is bad, it's worse than bad, it's disgusting, pro-abuse, and definitely harmful to young girls. The only thing it made me feel for any of the boys is how much I wish the anime was about her and Kent only. \\n\\n\r\nSkip it, and for the love of god, don't glorify Toma!",

            "content": "P R E M I S E\r\nTo begin with, Amnesia is an anime adaption to the otome game series of the same name. I love fantasy stories that include cards and their symbols, Wonderland-esque appeal, and the surreal feeling of wonder and mystery. However, having it come from an otome game, you must expect that the anime won't have the heroine romantically paired with any of the number of guys featured. Anime adaptions to otome games also normally have a \"main guy\" that is more leaned towards him, and there is one in this anime as well. \r\nA few years ago, I was obsessed withreverse harems because I loved the designs and art most of the time. Plot-wise, they're usually not very good, but great seiyuus are attracted to reverse-harem anime like they're magnets. The OP and EDs are a lot of the time top-notch. If looked at in this light, Amnesia fits into the typical reverse harem you'll find and expect. I've watched this anime twice, the second time dubbed, and I'll have to say that the dubbed version is better because the protagonist has more of a realistic personality.\\n\\n\r\nS H O R T C O M I N G S\\n\r\nWhat I dislike about the Amnesia series as a whole is the heroine. Yes, the heroine. For one thing, she doesn't even have a name, and the whole time the supporting characters don't mention her name once. Not in the anime, and not in the games. It's absolutely ridiculous - and on top of that, \"Heroine\" has a personality equivalent to a wall. Well, maybe you'd expect that, considering that she's lost her memory in the beginning. But she's just nonsensical - how? Whatever she's whisked into, she just GOES with it. She doesn't resist to a single thing, seemingly, and doesn't question things like she should. Granted, in the English dub, her personality is slightly more bearable, as she almost is a different person with the lines she says and the questions she actually asks. However, I love the Japanese voices for the guys, so neither version is perfect, unfortunately. The animation is also choppy, something that can be expected from a reverse harem. The guys aren't very appealing to me, except for two of them, and sadly 12 episodes isn't enough to get me attached, as Heroine moves onto another world before I can get to know each guy better (you'll understand what I mean better if you watch it). Though, I'm very used to this by now.\\n\\n\r\nP R O S\\n\r\nAs for practically every other reverse harem, the art is visually appealing. The OP and ED are very fitting and nice too; it feeds you with a dose of mystery, like you're immersing yourself, and it gets you into the mood enough to put up with the crap afterwards. Perhaps if you're used to otome game anime adaptions, Amnesia wouldn't be that disappointing story-wise, as it's rather interesting. It's not set in a school, and it's like fantasy fell onto reality. The color choices are colorful, and the character designs are detailed and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nC L O S U R E\\n\r\nI apologize if I sounded like I was ranting in the \"shortcomings,\" but I forgot to mention something else about Amnesia that could go in that section. Plot-wise, it took me two rounds of watching this series for me to truly understand what was happening. The first time... I don't think I understood a thing of what was happening. It was the second time - and it had to be in dub - then did I comprehend that whenever the Heroine died she was transported to a parallel world and such, which explained the changes in situation and some characters' personalities. Don't worry, that's not really a spoiler; it's better if you have that knowledge before watching if you plan to.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nOverall: 31/50 ~ 62% ~ 6/10",

            "content": "*The review will be edited... eventually.*\r\nAmnesia: the Dark Descent. No? Wait, wait... wrong title! Amnesia, the... no, just Amnesia! Sorry, sorry... Seems like I want this anime so desperately to be something more, than what it actually is, that I've started to mix the titles together! My bad... let's start over again, shall we?\r\nGirl has an amnesia. She doesn't remember a thing about herself or anything even slighty interesting about anything, but thank god she knows how to use a bathroom! She has this reverse harem-thing going on, and in every episode, we get a whole new \"love\"scenario with another unattractive bonesack-of-a-man, until the thrillingtale of \"a brat that barely said a word\", can finally ravel itself into a one, final deciossion, of which guy does she hate the least to love! Be just as excited as a dog that's about to get his balls cut off, to whitnes minute after a minute of this god-awful mess, that even a twelve-year-old would write... possibly even more succesfully, than this!\\n\\n\r\nSince this is - yet again - a review of an anime, that I obviously digest, I guess I'm supposed to be all butthurt, and angry, for wasting my time into this. Surprisingly... I'm not. I was given some great reviews over this anime, and granded, the start was overaly decent - not great, but decent enough, for a reverse-harem. This one wasn't so overly and disgustingly hyped and dripping of fanboy-goo - like so many other titles out there - so I wasn't really expecting anything special, and guess what... lucky me, because I wans't disapointed! This anime has absolutily nothing else to offer, but some pretty colors, nice animation, and overal decent music... nothing else!\\n\\n\r\nI guess I'm really not supposed to review somehing, that I dropped, since I haven't actually seen the story itself whole way through - that's actually one of my most important rules, to be honest! But, since that mold was already broken with Dragon Balls, I really shouldn't beat myself over for it too much, now should I? \\n\\n\r\nThe story - if you can even call it for one - is very straightforward and bland. Nothing stands out, and all is like this disgustingly gray, shapeless mess! Same can be said for the characters. They're all this weird, strange-looking variety of seemingly good-looking males, and this one, blander-than-bland- heroine, who's supposed to be everyones one-sided love-interest... because she has a amnesia, and can't remenber, who she bones, if any of them - they all seem to be some sort of deviants or rapist, which as in a fetish-stand-point, isn't really my cup of tea. Also, she seems to be really keen to be pinned down against a trees, walls, or overaly harassed, in the most sweet and innocent ways possible, because... hey, she's a girl, and girls like that sort of things, right? Right?!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime, is a perfect example for an so-called \"airballoon-anime\". It's nice to look at, and that may be more than enough for some, but once you realize, that what keeps this anime together, is just some hot air, you'll loose your interest very quikly, and like me, dropped it, or just... let it go. No matter, how you look at this anime, there's really not much to look at. The heroine is just some pretty-looking, shallow puppet, with no personality, nor anything to say - she can't form even one single sentence, without some umm's and ahm's - and the harem of these \"hotties\", are just as bland as you would expect of them to be... and not even that good-looking, for that matter! I personally can't stand this japanese stereotype for a hot guy, who looks like a girl and who's thigh is as thick as my arm, but when you're a leading girl, who herself has absolutily nothing else to offer, but some nice-looking, passive yet fragile object for any of their rapefantasies, I guess beggers can't be choosers. In the end, there's really nothing more important for a boy, than be this cold yet cool, antisocial jerk, who pins me down against anything standing against my back, or a girl to be this passive, submissive puppet, without any other merits, than looking pretty, now is there - according to a this anime, anyway!\\n\\n\r\nI really don't know, what to make off of this... this mess of an anime! Colours are nice, and the animation is good, but what's the point, if the story sucks, and the characters are as interesting, as the chewed-up bubblegum?! This was originally a dating-game, turned into a anime, so what does anybody really expect anyway, when looking at this?! My recomendation is, that if you like reverse-harems, and don't like to confuse your brains with stories, or actual characters, go ahead, and give this one a shot... and gimme another, since I'm gonna need all the vodka, to sober up from this one! \\n\\n\r\nBetter go play some Amnesia: the Dark Descent know... oh, my Me!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nOverall: 3",

            "content": "After watching the first three episodes I already asked myself why I started watching this anime. First thing: those boys are so...feminine. Seriously their legs are more beautiful than mine. Also their fashion is kinda... unusual and you won't see something like this in another one. \r\nThe story was horrible. I'll just be direct. at the beginning I really thought or hoped it would be something behind it but at the latest in episode 4 you realize where this is going. It keeps replaying itself with another boy. I know this anime came from those dating games in japan but still, I've seen countless otheranime with the same origin which are better than this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe drawing style of the anime wasn't that bad. Sure it was a typical girl anime and that stuff which I actually don't like to watch. But I liked the style of coloration and most of all the eyes of the characters. Only thing I hated about it were those ridiculous clothes of the boys. Which guy on earth runs around in half ripped of clothes and leggings? (despite an fashion designer)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound. I can't say that much about it. I didn't take care of the sound that much. Except one thing: how much does the seiyuu from the heroine actually earn? What the hell was her payment for ''speaking'' the girl? She wasn't talking a single word in most of the episodes. Only things like: uh? huh! ah? I almost flipped out because of that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As said\u2026the heroine. i could have kille her. I know she had amnesia but still why the hell can't you talk like a normal human?! all the time she was like dafuq? The boys weren't that fancy. There was actually nothing special in their personality. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Nah. i started this anime because I saw the name and thought it had something to do with the game. When I saw the characters and the synopsis I just thought: why not? Didn't watch any anime like this so I'll just try it out. I finished the anime out of the only reason that I hate dropping anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall. This anime is a waste of time if you're looking for a good story with much background and sense and meaning and morality. But I won't say it's not for killing time if you haven't got anything else to do or watch.",

If the anime was 26 episodes I have a feeling this anime would have been like more as they'd have more time to explain and make people who havent played the game understand. But the plot itself is interesting.\r\nArt= 9\r\nI loved the Art, they done the characters well and there eyes were amazing, specially since anime eyes usually are the thing that sets their emotions across. Im a fan of Toma and I like the way they done his design, and Shins.But of course the actual clothing, no one would wear. But its anime, anyone can wear anything. Oh and the backgrounds look well done too.\\n\\n\r\nSound = 8\\n\r\nI liked the sound. The opening and ending were well done. The Ost's of the anime was really soft and nice to listen too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter = 7\\n\r\nI understand its hard to adapt a otome game but still...They could have explained the characters better. They missed out on some of Shins background, missed A LOT on Toma and missed a lot on Ukyo too. It kind of hurts since people who wont play the game will have a permanent opinion on the characters just by the anime when the otome game itself explains better...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 8\\n\r\nIt depends really, I understood the anime that's why I enjoyed it a fair amount.\\n\r\nToma's route is all about him and his jealousy towards Ikki and his protectiveness so more of the jealous route.\\n\r\nShin's is basically Sherlock Homes thanks to his route being a mystery.\\n\r\nIkki's route bases on the whole fangirl theme and its more in depth with Rika\\n\r\nKent's is more logical and inexperience.\\n\r\nUkyo is the truth route, more of a fantasy theme then all of them\\n\\n\r\nOverall = 8\\n\r\nI liked this anime, I just wished it had more episodes, because as I said before It may have turned out better. I also hoped they'd go more in depth with the characters. But I did have high expectations for this show since the other otome adaption, Hakuouki, was amazing.\\n\r\nBut if you want to understand this anime id suggest reading the routes by a blogger since this anime does, basically, a quick summary on the routes.\\n\r\nWould I recommend? Only to people who are a die hard fan of amnesia or have read the routes, otherwise it'd get confusing.",

            "content": "Amnesia is an anime based off an a otome game made in Japan. While the anime is separate from the otome game, it still feels more like an advertisement to play it, then an anime. It contains 12 episodes, and is a reverse harem. This is shoujo so keep that in mind before watching.\r\nStory: 8.98/10 (*Review Begins)\r\nA girl wakes up after having collapsed with no memory of who she is with a spirit that only she can see for company. No-one can know that she has amnesia is it made evident that it has not been caused by her body or mind. The heroine, surroundedby handsome gents in the cafe she works at, must piece together her life with the help of her spirit companion. *While the anime is focused on our herione recovering her memories, the romance plays a bigger part. The mystery is intriguing, but the epsiode pacing is very awkward. The first half is dominated by the romance and the men she is dating in the alternate universe, so when she does figure out how she lost her memories, it is in the last two episodes. Having all this information being thrown at you in the last twenty minuets makes the ending seemed rushed/forced. The layout epsiode is predictable and same every two episodes (each boy gets two episodes). They meet, depressing back story, kiss, and then boy changes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.13/10 (Note: Each boy is based off a card suite in a deck of cards)\\n\r\nHeart: \u2665\\n\r\nThe Heart is Shin's route. He is our Herione's very sarcastic boyfriend. Apparenly they were childhood friends and he was family zoned, and they finally started dating. Shin still feels stuck in the family-zone, so now he does everything to get out (forcefully making out when she says no). Heroine also helped him in the past.\\n\r\nSpade: \u2660\\n\r\nThe Spade represents Ikki's route, and he is mega super popular with girls. When he was younger, he wish on a shooting star to be more popular with girls, and it came true. After 3 months the girl leaves him, and now dating is a game to him, seeing the next victim he can't seduce. The only problem is that Ikki can't seduce our herione, and usually he can just by looking the girl in the eyes.\\n\r\nClover: \u2663\\n\r\nThe Clover shows Kent's route, and let me say, he doesn't get his fair share of episodes! He only has one, and his actions are very intellectual and calculated. He doesn't have very much experience with dating, so there relationship is so awkward, that it's hilarious. He is the only boy who realized he wasn't with the right herione.\u00a0\\n\r\nDiamond: \u2666\u00a0\\n\r\nThe Diamond is Tomas's route. He is the creepiest by far, he loves our herione so much, that he drugs her and puts her in a cage so she is 'safe'. Yandere much? Anyway he does love her and though I was like wtf? when watching, it was a really good route.\\n\r\nJoker: ?\\n\r\nThe Joker is the oddball of the family. His route is so confusing, I had to watch it twice just to absorb it in. He has been following her the entire time (stalker) and is the only character I can say that truly loves her. It's hard to explain, but you have to watch the anime. Anything that I say about him in some sense is a spoiler.\\n\r\nHerione: *\\n\r\nShe is the probably the biggest let down. The fact that she didn't have a name didn't bother me, it's her lack of personality. She didn't speak much, and she didn't move the story along whatsoever. The boys were even started to get fed up!\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nSound: 9.98/10\\n\r\nThe opening and closing of this anime is the best ive heard yet (it's on my iPod). I loved the opening, modern, catchy, and eye popping. The voice acting for the guys were awesome as well, each voice fitting the personalities of the character. The herione barley said anything though. She usually made sound of confusion/ disbelief. She also did the long, melodramatic pauses where she uttered her bf's name in a wisper. Those are annoying as heck.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art was the saving grace we needed for this anime. For what the story is lacking, this makes up for it. The color scheme is beautifully done, each character designed differently. The herione is dressed uniquely and so are the men. The eyes are AMAZING. The eyes pop and are animated in an original way, as I haven't seen them that way before. The boys in her harem are attractive and overall this was beautiful. If you want to see top quality animation, this is a must see. A+\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime was a great watch, the story was captivating, and I adored the opening and ending theme. I watched this anime 3 times and each time I was still captivated by the beauty of the art. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.73/10\\n\r\nThis anime is very well done, the art, sound, characters, and sorta story is very unique. Overall this anime did have its flaws, but for an anime based off an otome game, this did a great job. I reccomend that you are a person who prefers to watch reverse harem before watching, as the genre doesn't suit everyone. The mystery is good, and the romance factor is exceedingly prominent, and that is good or bad, you decide. Enjoy!",

            "content": "When I started watching this anime believe it or not I confused it with Dusk Maiden of Amnesia, and actually had expectations of this show being good. So, I continued watching this anime like a fool expecting something extravagant to happen. Well, from my tone you can probably guess that didn\u2019t happen at all!\r\nSo, without further ado I\u2019ll start my rant\u2026 sorry I mean review.\r\nAmnesia is an anime based of a visual novel series and was released in 2013. It centers on a girl who wakes up in a caf\u00e9 to discover she has amnesia. She later with the help of Lily, I am sorryOreion needs to get her memories back. And for some reason after two episodes, she continuously travels back in time where she is in a different dimension with slight changes. Oh yeah, that and the fact that she gets it on with a different guy in each new arc! \\n\\n\r\nWell, ain\u2019t that quality entertainment!\\n\\n\r\nThat is pretty much it to the plot of Amnesia. And let\u2019s be honest it is below par and was obviously targeted towards a female demographic like most reverse harem anime are nowadays. Now, what Amnesia suffered the most was from its characters and pacing.\\n\\n\r\nThe show never seemed to go anywhere and none of the confusion hardly seemed to get cleared up. Instead of trying to make some goddamn sense out of the show, they would instead make our main female protagonist either get man handled by what looks like a bunch of Greek adonises. The romances had some cute moments, I will give it that, but after she was with one guy in one dimension, the show would completely forgot about that character after she was done being with them. Instead, they would move on to another guy, and the cycle is simply repeated.\\n\\n\r\nOh and after she is done dating one of these guys, she dies! If they were gonna rip of Higurashi couldn\u2019t they have at least made it brutal for crying out loud?\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why she dies after a certain period of time is because the dimension won\u2019t accept her existence, in the world. Then again, it\u2019s not like the anime community would value her existence either way. The female lead has no personality and her having Amnesia is no fucking excuse, because characters like Tada Banri from Golden Time and the Black Haired woman from Death Parade still have wonderful personalities. This chick on the other is as bland as cardboard.\\n\\n\r\nBut, I will give her credit for not being as intolerable as Julie from Diabolik Lovers. I\u2019ll give her that. However, what is interesting about this bitch is that she doesn\u2019t even have a fucking name. Which doesn\u2019t make her a badass like Clint Eastwood but it just goes to show, how boring this Mary Sue of a character is.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the guys on the other hand are all are clich\u00e9d and do fall into certain reverse harem tropes. You have got the hot headed one, the play boy, the trap, the kuudere and the yandere! The only two characters I did like were Shin and Kento, well mainly Kento. But, none the less it seems as if none of the guys did anything to make the plot of the show interesting, and was there for the manservice I guess. They were just as useless as our heroine, even if their clich\u00e9d personalities were entertaining sometimes.\\n\r\nOreion on the other hand reminded me too much of Lily from La Corda D\u2019oro and the two basically have the same personalities and looks. I like Lily more but I guess I enjoyed Oreion too!\\n\\n\r\nNow the animation on the other hand wasn\u2019t that bad, it was actually pretty good for a reverse harem. The character designs were unique but their wardrobes made me question what kind of a world they were living in. Like seriously, who the fuck where\u2019s a belt around their neck? Does Shin have any idea he could strangle himself with it?\\n\\n\r\nIt seems like as if Lady Gaga became ruler of the world and made it a law that people must  dress like runaway models! Like why?\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the thing that made me almost flip my table over was its BS ending. I can\u2019t believe I sat through 12 episodes for such a lame conclusion to this crappy series. Plus, we never even get to see her get her fucking memories back. You could have given her a personality for at least one minute couldn\u2019t ya? Even Bella got a personality towards the last Twilight film!\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the opening of the show was that one silver lining among the large gray cloud which was the show. I freaking loved it and the animation for the opening is outstanding. The opening actually makes the show look like it is worth watching, and I wish the creators of the show would have put much effort into the plot like they did with the opening. The song too is an earworm and what can even after many days or months later I still don\u2019t get seem to get tired of this song! So, this song is like a reward after having to deal with this show.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in case you are deaf let me make it clear that you my friend should not check out Amnesia. To summarize what I said in a nutshell, the show has a shitty plot, shitty characters and a shitty ending. That should be reason even to skip these twelve time consuming episodes! However, if you don\u2019t care about a good plot, memorable characters or a lame ending then go check it out if you only want a show for the hot guys manhandling a lame ass girl.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of you with decent taste in anime don\u2019t worry, you guys won\u2019t leave empty handed today because I will provide you with some recommendations. You can check out Higurashi, a horror gore anime with different arcs. Or maybe you can check out Amagami SS, if horror ain\u2019t your forte. It is actually a harem but unlike Amnesia the dude getting it on with different characters is worth watching. Or you check out Golden Time, which also deals with a guy getting amnesia and his journey to get his life together while struggling to deal with his past and present. They are in my opinion all worth checking out!\\n",

However, this anime is about the heroine dating with different guys and the romance story just goes nowhere.\r\nWhat a snooze-fest.\r\nThe anime is so boring. The most boring anime character is the main heroine, she always gets herself vulnerable to situations and she puts on that gloomy look every time. Basically there is no story at all in this anime. \r\nThe animation although it wasfantastic, the animation was stilted.\\n\\n\r\nThe music inside is sleep-inducing. I was sleeping throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe only person that carries the story is Ukyo. Even the ending was terribly done. I was laughing so hard at the ending because of the anime producers' desperate efforts in making this a sad ending of departure of the main girl from Orion after she regained her memories.\\n\\n\r\nIf you need a sleeping pill, just watch this anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo basically, I gave it a 2/10.

So I gave it a try to say the truth is this anime isn't bad but to me its a bit confusing. There were moments were I didn't get what was happening and I just felt lost. Through out the story you get to understand a bit more and also the anime is a bit short for my taste so if you looking for a well develop story you might want to skip this one. At the end I was both happy and type mad I felt like thereshould had been more or at least they should have reveal more. One thing I'll say is that I really got connected with the main character that's what made me kept watching the feeling of what will happen next even thought I felt the story wasn't developed as well the story wasn't bad. If you are looking for an ok short fantasy/romance/mystery anime that bring you close to the main character journey this for you. If you looking for a well develop mouth dropping anime don't get your hopes up to high.",

The story itself is unique, eye catching, and I could even say mind blowing. There are a piece of every genre in this anime, including mystery, romance, reverse harem, and event some elements of horror. There are fragments of memory given in every episode, and at some point in the story, you will piece them together.\r\nArt (9/10): The art is probably one of the strongest points in this beautifully draw series.

The characters are beautifully drawn. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10): The sound of this anime is average, from the voice acting, to the theme song. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10): I am impressed by the characterization in this anime. Being a short anime, with only 12 episodes, and made from a game, the characters are amazingly well brought out. Though a bit cliche, each of the characters have a different personality. Since there aren't much information given for the main female protagonist, her shy and frightened personality helps hide the flaws in her character. Everything is cool except when you want to punch her in the face for her stupid decisions.\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime. I finished it in one go, and it was a fascinating and mind blowing journey.

            "content": "Now, when I heard of Amnesia, I was excited. So, so, SO mind blowing-ly excited. My first thoughts? 'LOOK AT THAT ART UGH NOW I HAVE TO WATCH THIS.'\r\nI still contemplate whether that was a good idea or not. Now I don't mean to just ramble on about the negative parts of this anime, because really, it does have it's redeeming qualities, but there simply wasn't enough there for me to give it more than a 5. \r\nStory: 3/10\r\nOf course since this is based off a visual novel, an otome game to be specific, I wasn't expecting anything perfect. I love reverse harem as muchas the next girl/guy, but animes like Uta No Prince-Sama taught me not to expect anything much in story, just a lot in art. The reason I'm giving this a 3 is because, well... I quite like stories that give me bits as I go on, so I stay interested. So I want to know what happens next, so I can keep forming the puzzle in my head, steadily, even if it's creating the wrong picture. This anime? I suggest you watch it if you like to be confused for practically the whole anime. Everything is pretty much revealed in the last two episodes, so sometimes I feel like I could have just watched the first episode, then the last two. To be honest for half the anime I was convinced that every time the Heroine died she revived with a new boyfriend but er... That wouldn't be the best plot, would it?\\n\\n\r\nDespite this being a reverse harem, which of course means, awh yeah, romance, it actually didn't hold that much in the romance field. Yes, there were the basics of like, kissing, and etc, but it made me feel near nothing as it felt like I was just watching strangers kiss. I felt no attachment to them, half the time. The ending was not satisfying to me in the least, and left me with a mostly bitter taste in my mouth, honestly. But I can't tell you I wasn't interested in the least, of course. Sure, this story wasn't completely immersing, but it wasn't completely terrible. I managed to finish it after all, due to that little bit of curiosity in me. That curiosity was never sated, but er, I'll give them credit for trying. \\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis had to be the absolute best quality of this anime, actually. I could forgive it's plot sometimes just because of it, after all. The colors chosen were lovely, and the style was just so crisp and pretty. This is what pulled me to watch the anime in the first place, just how beautiful the art was. The eyes have to be my favorite part though. LOOK AT THEM. They're absolutely stunning! I know some might definitely beg to differ, as they might make you think there's something special about their super amazing eyeballs, (which there really isn't, they're just nice to look at.) All those pretty close ups gave me more time to admire them soooo... Yeah. The art definitely pleased me. \\n\\n\r\nThe only qualm I have is the outfits. WHAT. No, seriously, WHAT?! I can't believe no one on the streets gave those guys weird looks. Sure, your steampunk/gothic clothes are pretty sexy, but what?! Everyone is wearing normal clothing, even the Heroine is wearing fairly normal clothes... But these guys? Man, are they fashionistas trying to give out a message. Perhaps the reason no one questions their sense in fashion is because everybody is completely used to it? I don't know. You tell me.\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so I was a bit iffy on the sound. I don't have much to say on the voice acting, I quite liked all their voices. They suited them quite well, so no qualms on that. I have to say, I fell in love with that little music box track. It's a sweet little thing, it makes me think of a curious child, or something like that. It suited the anime in that aspect, I suppose. The opening and the ending definitely were memorable for me though, as I really liked them. (especially the ED with that whispering and intense background) The only problem for me though is that I felt as catchy and amazingly awesome both songs were, Zoetrope and Recall did not suit this anime. It made seem way more action packed and tantalizingly laced with mystery than it actually was. Sure there was action, kinda, (though most of it was near the end), but it seemed a bit too crazy for such an anime. The OP was a little better but still... Dat Jrock. (Is it Jrock? I don't know.)\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10 \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem with this anime might've been the Heroine. Why am I putting an uppercase for Heroine, you may ask? Well, other than that, she has no name. I guess since this is off an otome game, (I'm assuming it's the type that lets you change her name), they decided NOT to name her. That definitely was a new one to me, but not necessarily a good thing. It didn't bother me too much that she didn't have a name, as none of the guys ever needed to use it apparently, but it definitely made her feel way less like a plausible character. But never mind that, she never really felt much like a plausible character in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nThis was pretty much the Watch Boys Hold A Conversation With Themselves anime. Yes, she spoke, (thank heavens), but usually every person who talked to the Heroine, minus Orion was pretty much talking to themselves. I was actually surprised in the last two episodes, with how much speaking she did. When people talked to her, especially the boys, her main reactions would often be a tiny gasp, little noises or just plain staring, as if she has no clue what's happening. Which is true for the most part half the time, but really? I just could not sympathize with her, and by the end of it she just made me want to sigh and hold my face in my hands. Most characters had little to none in backstories, and character development was pretty much watching them flirt with the Heroine. Wow, so much development. They're not completely terrible though, at least they speak. \\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character definitely had to be Toma, really. Ukyo pulls in a close second, though. Why, you may ask? Because there was character development to speak of, yay! They had to be some of the only characters I didn't actually feel nothing towards, because as lovely as Shin's face is, and as much as I wanted to make him my favorite, I couldn't. Though Toma didn't choose the appropriate methods of expressing his love, at least he had reasons. Sorta kinda lika. \\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI can't say much for this. There were times when I mildly enjoyed it, but there were never really 'WOW I NEED TO REWIND THAT' moments. I definitely watched episode nine with happiness due to the fact that... Er, well spoilers. Just... plot was happening, and I liked it. Or well, side-ark. Whatever. Something. (Still need to work on my review language)\\n\r\n---\\n\\n\r\nOverall - \\n\r\nStory + Art + Sound + Character + Enjoyment x 2 \\n\r\n3 + 9 + 7 + 3 + 4 x 2 = 52\\n\r\n52/100 = 5.2/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 5\\n\\n\r\nMy advice, watch Amnesia if you just want to be immersed in pretty boys. To fully enjoy this, er... Perhaps don't ask too many questions until near the end, it will save you a lot of headaches because you probably won't get those answer anytime soon. I feel bad, because I know this review might be really on the negative side, and this anime isn't completely unwatchable... But, good luck to those of you who wish to watch it.",

            "content": "I just finished Amnesia and since it was recently aired, I decided to write a review and share my opinion. This is my first review! \r\nSTORY/PACING: 6.5/10\r\nThis story contained traveling between parallel dimensions, amnesia, and struggling to recover the main character's memories. And of course, a whole bunch of guys the main character could choose from (Since it was adapted from an Otome PSP game). It may sound clich\u00e9 but it isn't as predictable as it sounds. It held a lot of suspense right to the last episode and plot was somewhat unique. \r\nThe pacing could be seen as either good or bad. Bad becauseof the fact that you didn't know much of what was going on until the 7th or 8th episode, and good because since you didn't know much of what was going on, you'd want to keep watching. I am one of those people who like to come up with theories on what's going to happen which is why I didn't find the pacing bad. But there are others who prefer to know more about what's going on.\\n\r\nI was just not satisfied with the ending. The first episodes held a mysterious mood to them, but the ending was too magical and leaned more to the fantasy side. It just didn't really fit.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was absolutely BEAUTIFUL! You'd definitely enjoy the amazing and unique outfits and eyes. Not to mention the fact that you'll LOVE the guys too!\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were one of the best two I've ever heard. Zoetrope (By Yanagi Nagi) had a very unique beat while Recall (By Ray) had a mysterious mood to it, fitting the anime perfectly. I'd usually skip the openings and endings but this anime had me listen to both all the way to the end.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was good. All of the voices fit the characters pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 5.5/10\\n\\n\r\nNot all of the characters were stereotypes, as some people put it. Sure, there was the lone-wolf, Mr. Popular, the childhood friend, the mysterious guy, and that super smart guy with hardly any emotion. But first of all, Ikki isn't all full of himself like what the Mr. Popular stereotype is actually like. And Toma is not that normal 'childhood friend'. Locking the one he loves in a cage to protect her, you'd think he was a Tsundere.\\n\r\nThe main problem was the Heroine. (She doesn't have a name.) I also agree that she has the personality of a wooden board. Of course you would be quiet and shy if you had amnesia, but that doesn't mean you'll have no emotion at all. You barely see her smile, and I don't even think she laughs, though I may be wrong. She hardly talks, just stays in one place and does the occasional 'ehhh' and stares. When she gets kissed, she's frozen like a statue, eyes WIDE open. Oh, and the Heroine never makes a move to tell any of the guys her real  feelings and her opinion. She gets pushed against a tree, forcefully kissed, and forgives them right away. She never gets angry.\\n\r\nAnd I really think Orion didn't really fit into this. Sure he's there to help the Heroine, but he just seems too... magical.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSeeing that I finished this anime in two days, I think I really enjoyed it. When I started, I just couldn't stop. The anime starts off pretty confusing, but that's what I liked about it. I didn't know what was going on, so I wanted to keep on watching and let the mystery unravel.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd give this a 7.5. I rated it a 7 on my anime list because you can't do 0.5's. \\n\r\nThis anime was really good in my opinion. This has just the right amount of romance and mystery combined. And the Heroine had scenes with all the guys so everyone's happy! \\n",

            "content": "Let me start of by saying 1. This review is done by a female and 2. Yes I do particularly like anime's filled with a lot of good looking guys. But no, I do not just watch certain anime's for that reason.\r\nI don't write very many reviews either... So I can't really say this is going to be a good one.\r\nWhen I first decided to watch this, I had no idea it was an Otome game. Plus, I didn't even realize the main girl didn't have a name. Fail on my part twice. Around the third episode I was really confused and began looking atcomments seeing if others were confused too, but no, most of the people watching it knew it was a game. Knowing that, I understood why she didn't have a name. So there was one less thing to bug me.\\n\r\nNow onto the different parts of the story.\\n\\n\r\nBeginning:\\n\r\nWe find out she has amnesia. Kind of obvious since it's the title. At this point in time it doesn't seem like she's dating anyone. She's just really confused and trying to trigger her memories. What would any typical person do if they lost their memories. How was she to know if she truly did know those people? And then the part where I became confused happened.\\n\r\nEach character has their own tragic story. One of those typical \"you saved me from myself\" kind of things.\\n\\n\r\nShin:\\n\r\nDidn't really care for this guy. He's young, brash, smart alec, and acts superior. You don't really know what's going on at this point, and the Heroine is trying to piece together what happened in the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nIkki:\\n\r\nFrom this point, things could either get really confusing or they start making sense. I liked Ikki, a lot. Though I must say he has one of the scariest fan clubs I've seen in anime yet. ._.\\n\\n\r\nKento:\\n\r\nGenius, kind-hearted but can't express himself well, awkward, not really sure about human emotion. He's so smart, that he actually explained what was going on just based on what had happened so far. However, that can't be the end, that had to be some sort of twist. \\n\\n\r\nToma:\\n\r\nCrazy Ukyo appears when it's Toma's turn. Which is fitting because we find out that Toma is... well.. kind of a psychopath himself. ._.\\n\r\nWhy he's the favorite of a lot of girls I will never know. \\n\\n\r\nUkyo:\\n\r\nMy personal favorite. Split-personality. But his actual self is really amazing, not the other side. We had seen him previously often, both personalities. So it wasn't hard to put together he had a personality disorder. During Ukyo's turn, all the action happens. This part would have to be, in my opinion, the best part of the anime. Here is where all the suspense happens if there were to be any.\\n\\n\r\nEnd:\\n\r\nAt first, I was kind of mad at the ending. I mean, how could you end it without resolving where she ended up? But then I remembered it was an Otome Game and that she actually had a choice. And since she is the viewer, that meant the choice was ours to make. So I couldn't really knock of points for the ending.\\n\\n\r\nLost points:\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nThey could have given each character equal time. It wasn't fair that most had two episodes whereas Kento only had one. \\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThough I liked the colors of the anime, and the use of the card symbols, the art itself felt too... how should I put this... plain. For an anime geared towards girls it was just kind of plain. \\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis goes back to how little time she had with each person. There wasn't much character development. The Heroine had practically no character at all besides agree and disagree based on what answers one probably would have given in the game.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nI didn't really like all the scenes with Orion. They could have been shortened. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10 but of course you probably already knew that since it shows.\\n\\n\r\nReview aside, if I were to play this game, personally, I would have probably either chosen Ikki, Kento, or Ukyo. Most likely Ukyo because I really liked him. :)\\n\r\nI typed more than I thought I would. o.o",

            "content": "[SPOILER FREE FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO READ BEFORE WATCHING]\r\nYes, I know what your thinking. \"I can't believe you gave this anime a 10/10!\". And yes I know a lot of people really hate this show, but I mostly understand where they are coming from. However, I have to be honest with myself and say I REALLY liked this anime. First let me start out by stating that I am not a big reverse harem fan (even if I am a girl), so for me to say that I enjoyed this is pretty weird. Anime like Brothers Conflict and Diabolik Lovers are the type ofreverse harem that I cannot stand. \"Why?\" you may ask. Simply because there are TOO MANY BOYS. You probably think I'm crazy for saying that but I am not one to enjoy the company of 30 of people, let alone 30 cute boys. So that makes up a big reason why I enjoyed Amnesia so much.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'm going to explain why I gave each section the rating that I did. I gave the plot an 8/10, and this is where most people gave a really low rating on. I honestly do not understand that. Some of my favorite shows are ones that have unique plots and don't throw in some of the many anime cliques. Amnesia did a very good job at staying away from that. I also saw very little fan service which made me feel comfortable watching the show. Now that I think about it, thats probably the reason why those who hated this show just loved anime like Fairy Tail (which is riddled with fan service).\\n\\n\r\nNow of course I had to give the art a 10. It held up to the video game's AMAZING art and I really liked the way they were drawn. Not only that but (Of course I have to mention this) their eyes were almost hypnotising to look at. Unlike the otome game, the two different eye colors for each character were more emphasised which made them slightly resemble pokeballs. The art for Amnesia will always seize to amaze me.\\n\\n\r\nTime for the characters. This is another BIG reason why so many people disliked the show. \"OH the heroines doesn't react enough!\" or \"Geez that Shin guy needs to stop being so rude to her\". These are the things that make people angry. So if you've made it this far and have thought the same things then this is what I have to tell you. SHE HAS AMNESIA! She is not going to react much to situations since she has NO clue what anyone is talking about. The heroine also has to hide her amnesia from everyone so they don't take advantage of her. So I don't expect her to trot around with a smile on her face trying to greet every person she meets on the street. In fact, if that did happen I would think she is weird. I tried to put myself in her shoes and think if I would react the same way. Honestly, I could see myself being exactly like her. So the heroine's lack of emotion is not a problem for me. The 5 main guys are not problems either because I think that they were written well for they each have a different \"-dere\" personality. I like how they even threw in a yandere to make those masochist girls get mega nose bleeds.\\n\\n\r\nI don't need to explain enjoyment because I think I have already expressed my mass amount of enjoyment for this anime already. With this said I gave Amnesia a 10/10. I definitely recommend this to people who enjoy mysteries and romances. If you like reverse harems then I don't think you will get your full experience of \"hot guys doing hot stuff\" when you watch this. Of course there is kissing (and a lot of it) but that is about the most fan service you will get. If you made it this far then well done. Here is a gold star. I made this review longer because I feel strongly about this anime. I think I have defended it and the otome game and little to much so I'll end it on that note. Now go and enjoy the show!",

Although, it did well in portraying each scene on guys. It started on flashback, but as you go through the episodes it would not even try to drop hints or explain it so it tends to become a confusion. The art design of characters is stylish but as you watch the entire episodes there are no variations in the dress. The sound is so-so. About the heroine, sheis passive through the whole episodes. Her emotions are stiff. I mean no reaction, she's just going through the flow. If you are a fan girl, you would enjoy the art of guys. I'm not satisfied with how the anime ends.",

            "content": "I admit I looked at \"Amnesia\" a long time ago and for this reason I didn't remember all the events and the names of the characters accurately.\r\nAfter watching it I was so baffled by how badly a visual novel in anime could be transposed that it simply went by the wayside; and then when I tried to remember the title I had to squeeze the whole brain to find the keywords that allowed me to find it in the research.\r\nThe protagonist is extremely shy, silent, does not talk much, does not fight against what is happening in an active way, which certainly makes her theworst character of this beautiful anime but allows her to identify herself very easily, and enjoy the wonderful journey that happens to her: every day a different parallel life, in the arms of a different boy, and each of them loves her differently and for different reasons. Every time he has to understand how the plan in which he finds himself works, learn about the relationship with the boyfriend, but when he becomes fond of it, it is time to jump into another life. Incredibly romantic, I fell in love with every episode of a different guy, and in the last episode all the threads come together, the story takes shape and ends in beauty. Full marks.\\n\r\n\"Amnesia\" is an anime taken from a video game, precisely an otome game (and already from here ...), which sees as protagonist a dude and mute chick who does not have a name, and who already begins the series faints, like I miss Dante Alighieri in \"La Divina Commedia\". She has no memories and has a spirit with her, Orion, who helps and advises her (but in reality it is really useless), and in twelve episodes we see her that every tot is in a different world where she is with a different type from the other world. The four boys (Shin the tasteless, Ikky the languid, Kento the mathematician and Toma the psychopath) plus Ukyo, who is the unbalanced par excellence and the darkest character of the whole series, are one more crazy than the other and all in love of our protagonist (it is so very beautiful ^^)",

I was so pumped when I found out this show exists because I truly enjoyed the game when I played it - years ago, by the way. Unfortunately, after watching the whole anime, including the OVA, I felt like my time was wasted. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe premise is pretty ok: the lead character has amnesia and she has to learn who she is and who she can/can't trust as the time goes on. But every time she dies, she goes back to another world where things are different, so she must findout what's going on. Although the concept itself is kinda interesting, the plot gets worst every minute it passes. Every episode is the same thing over and over. I understand that is based off a game but the adaptation SHOULDN'T BE EXACTLY LIKE THE GAME. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is the only good thing about this. The characters are beautiful, as you should expect of a love story anime, and the background is absolutely outstanding. It does fit the story pretty well, but this just goes to waste as you can tell.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\r\nThe whole show is strangely and disturbingly quiet. Although the intro and outro is pretty cute, the episodes almost doesn't have any sounds besides the character's voices and some of their action's sounds.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nAll of the characters are way too basic and our main character is WAAAY too submissive and shy, even in her thoughts. She can't do anything for herself and relies on the fairy/ghost that's following her, which is also not an interesting character at all. The only characters that you can say it's decent (in relation to the other characters) is Ukyou and maaaybe Toma, and you won't see Ukyou in most of the episodes. All of the characters are basic and empty and you can't see any progression. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nI truly had a tiny bit of hope that this could turn out a good anime, but sadly, that's not the case. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nYou hope that the OVA has some explanation about why the fuck you have more questions than answers at the end of the show but nope, it has more 22 minutes sucked in from your life. \\n\\n\r\nPlease don't watch it, just play the graphic novel instead.",

Personally, I enjoyed it very much ( that is why I believe that my enjoyment rate was around 8/10). As far as I know, Amnesia is also an otome game, and the anime is probably made after it. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\n6: because it says \u201dfair\u201d \r\nThe story isn't such a big deal, but it is rather cute: the plot goes on smoothly and it keeps your attention alive, even though you might guess sometimes what is going to happen. It's not about that, but about thefact that it has something in it that makes you wish to watch it until the end. And the story  has this sparkle of un-namable something. The story in itself, I have to admit, is not extraordinary (as I said before, neither the anime is). The plot revolves around a confused girl who slowly, but surely, starts to understand what is going on - from there on, all the so-called-problem begins, and we understand that she travels through parallel world involuntarily. As I said, it's nothing to get surprised about because the story is so constructed that you can fairly understand it is not about the story, but a strong correlation between everything that's going on. A fair correlation that doesn't demand greatness, just the mere essence of being. That's why I believe the story is fair: it doesn't demand more than it has to offer, and that is why the story seems good enough to me.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 7/10\\n\r\nI guess the art is pretty good. For those who are interested (or fascinated) by attractive guys with interesting eyes, you might find the art pleasant. As for myself, I liked the art except some several details: I didn't like their eyes, they crept me out ( the colours weren't right). Also, everything seemed rather sparkly and unreal (even for an anime), which makes you understand immediately that the anime might be ...the anime version of a game. All in all, for those who like these types of details (sparkle, colourful environment -and eyes, and clothes), then you might as well enjoy it very much. I objectively rate it 7/10, but -to be entirely honest - I was really abashed by those eyes; eventually I came to get used to them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack seems very good to me. Also, I guess there's nothing much to comment here. It matches the atmosphere and the anime in itself perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10 ( but if we talk about specific characters, I'd give Toma 10/10 :3 )\\n\r\nAs I said before, the anime is a very strong correlation between everything that goes on in it, the characters included. There is no main ...thing, no main detail put in the spot of the light. It's everything there is, it demands that and nothing more (which I came to admire very much). That being said, even though the characters are not the main thing that's been underlined as most important in the anime, I still liked them. They are nothing out of common, they are common characters with very common personalities (and also looks). Being a reverse-harem, the boys are, obviously, very attractive. Every each of them becomes charming at a point or another, and taking them \u201das a whole\u201d, someone would be rather inclined to underline the fact that they are a bunch of really attractive hotties. The \u201dmain\u201d character, the girl, is also very cute (I liked her personality very much; as it is supposed to be, she is very kind, for those who have  a \u201dthing\u201d for honest-kind girls/personalities, I suppose you might get a like on her). I believe the characters are also \u201dfair\u201d to the anime in its entity because as well as the story and everything above, it doesn't demand more than what it can actually give. They are appropriate to the state of being.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI couldn't sleep until i finished the series (Thank God it were only 12 episodes). I had a lot of fun watching it: I cannot rate this in any possible way objectively. It is rather personal: I had \u201dfun\u201d watching it, I was always curious to see what's next and what kind of reactions she'll have. Actually, it is rather predictable what's going to happen. Even so, it is enjoyable because it makes you want to see HOW exactly are all those things going to happen. I loved that about the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI had fun watching it; but I have to give warnings: This is not a great anime. It's average. Made after an otome-game, it doesn't gave a great plot, neither great characters, there is no main point in the anime and even though it has a very nice way of presenting everything, you will not get the feeling you get from those masterpieces. It's just average: an anime you might possibly enjoy to watch some night when you feel like watching some random anime. I, for must say, believe it's fair in itself. It doesn't offer much, but it doesn't demand much either. If you regard this anime as something like that, something that gives only that and nothing more, demands what it demands and gives what it promises to, if you do that, you might as well enjoy it. The art is okay, the sound also - the story and the characters synchronise perfectly, the enjoyment might be great if you like those blurry atmosphere with kissing coming out of nowhere (but nor really), fast romances (but nicely constructed), interesting characters (but nothing out of common)... overall, I believe some might give it a try. It is NOT a waste of time. It's enjoyable.",

            "content": "If you're expecting a comedic and happy atmosphere from this anime, I'd say you've come to the wrong place my friend. The idea of Amnesia originated from a H-game, where you set flags on routes and achieve a certain ending.This anime is target at young female viewers so if you're a guy, you might have a hard time following. Amnesia is told in a first-person view which, in other words, you basically have no clue what is happening throughout the story until the very end. I enjoyed watching this anime not because I love the mystery genre, but because of it's originality/plot.\r\nFirstly, lets talk aboutthe making of this anime. The reason why I started this anime was mainly for it's art. I was interested in how each individual character was drawn to be significant to the symbols of a card game such as hearts, diamonds, clover, etc. Other than the artwork, I was also impressed by the opening theme song of Amnesia, which I believe was sang by Yanagi Nagi. It helped prepared the right mood in the beginning of each episode mainly because its catchy, but thats my opinion after all.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we're done with the artwork and sound production, lets move on to the creation of the characters. The main character of this story is the heroine, which was never given a name throughout the ENTIRE series. If I had to describe her character, it would be plain, weak, inferior, clueless, airhead, doesn't have much of a personality at all. But that's acceptable once you forget who you are. The fact that she's lucky to experience dating with four attractive dudes won't change. Throughout the story, the heroine is always clueless of her surroundings. The background given to the heroine was that she was childhood friends with two boys named Shin and Toma. As the story progresses, you'll notice quite a few changes with this heroine, well technically to be more specific, she's able to communicate more comfortably with her surroundings.\\n\\n\r\nThe very first arc of the anime begins with Shin. I'd say that Shin can be compared to an ice cream, because he gives out a cold impression and yet he's sweet and kind. He is mostly shown at the exposition of the story and seems to have a deep relationship with the heroine. Nearing the end of his arc, he becomes more forceful and impatient with the heroine. His symbol is the heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc leads on to another male lead, Ikki. Ikki is more of the idealistic boyfriend and is perfect at everything, especially on the looks. The heroines first encounter with Ikki is when he helps her make some kinda ice cream thingy (iunno what its called). It is rumoured that every girl Ikki dates with always breaks up after 3-months because of the competition between fangirls. His symbol is the diamond.In my opinion, this was the most BORING part of the story, reason being it was dodgy and unreliable to the main concept of the story, as if it was there to take up three whole episodes for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Ikki's arc is Kent's arc. Kent is definitely not the ideal boyfriend and shows no emotion/affection towards the heroine. Throughout the story, Kent becomes more 'open' to the heroine and is able to express his affection towards her. His symbol is the clover. I really liked this part of the story because I liked seeing the character development of Kent.\\n\\n\r\nThe next arc, which was my favourite, is Toma's arc. The reason why I loved this character is because he was the first yandere male lead I knew. The behaviour Toma takes whenever he's near to the heroine is quite over-protective. Throughout the story, Toma shows his affection towards heroine is by confining her in a cage to protect her from \"antagonists\". Nearing the end of the story, the heroine discovers her true feeling for Toma and eventually forgives his actions. This arc in particular was the start of the rising action of the story, holding up a tense feeling.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the Ukyou arc, which is the climax of the story. Ukyou is first seen in the anime when he saves her from what could've been a car accident. What specifically interests me about Ukyou is that he has a split personality which is quite a mystery throughout the story. One that wants to kill the heroine, and one which wants to protect her at all costs. Ukyou seems to have some knowledge of why the heroine is passing through parallel worlds (spoiler). Ukyou is known to have interest in photography, but to be honest, I don't see what this has to do with the plot at all.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching this anime, I can tell that a lot of effort was put into making this anime. I was always looked forward to what would happen in the next episode. I really recommend trying out this anime because you don't know what you're missing out on!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Basic Info for the anime:\r\n1 It's based on an Otome Game.\r\n2 The main character or the \"heroine\" has Amnesia.\r\n3 There are a LOT of cute guys\r\nIf you've ever played an otome game then you know main characters, or heroines, are really dull with no personality this so YOU can get into the synch of the story. Amnesia tries to be the closest it can to the game, and that includes dull heroines, if you consider this then the anime does a pretty good job. Well it SHOULD! But they didn't take advantage of this fact and unintentionally made the main character REALLY annoying, I meaneven if you have amnesia you should have some personality, don't you think? Well the heroine doesn't and whenever she shows a bit of personality it's of a whiny, kinda dumb, girl. I think this was the major setback of the story if the main character had been more easy to symphatise with it would've been great. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that it was pretty neat. The art was absolutely gorgeous and mesmerizing probably one of the best I've ever seen! Music was good. The story was reaaally promising but wasted. I enjoyed watching this especially because it's the first completely girl-only fanservice anime I've ever seen and I think that's good, We girls are finally are taking in consideration and I really hope this increases.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe Amnesia will be the start of this, not the best star, but a start nevertheless.",

            "content": "Do I recommend this anime? No\r\nIf you are new to the reverse-harem genre (one girl who has a million boys to choose from), DO NOT let this be your first one. If you have watched tons of reverse harem, and have become tired of the clich\u00e9 storylines, watch it. However, don\u2019t get angry at me if you hate it!\r\nLet\u2019s start with the characters:\r\nAll of the boys are one dimensional. From the very get-go, I already predicted who the heroine was going to end up with...luckily, I was wrong (since it was open ending). Nonetheless, that does not mean the story was completely original. Even whenthe story progressed, the characters are still very bland. You have the nerd, the popular one, the one that cannot express himself, and the boy next door.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, there was a tendency of the men saying a line similar to this: I\u2019m a man. I have temptation. Don't come near me or I'll do something to you!\" Uh, do guys in real life really say that to women? Do women really like it when that is said? \u2018Cause if that was me; I would kick the guy in the nuts and run away!\\n\\n\r\nDespite how annoying the boys were, if you like a certain type of male character, there will be an episode satisfying your romantic set-up. I\u2019m not going into details with this because the little spoilers can ruin the slightest enjoyable/intriguing content this anime actually has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the heroine!\\n\r\nI did not notice this until I read it, but her name was never mentioned! The whole show was like a video game, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the viewers were supposed to feel like the main character (I didn\u2019t though\u2026). Anyways, she was BORING. No personality whatsoever! I wanted to punch her because of how ridiculously dumb she was. If any character could raise my blood pressure, it\u2019s her!! Also, she did not even have real dialogues/monologues. She went with the flow of life and rarely cared that she had amnesia even when it was negatively affecting her and the people around her. She was unique, but a show should NEVER have a main character like her! She really dug her own grave in each episode. So sad\u2026NOT!  (Also, I think they went with the Amnesia story because it gave a reasonable excuse for her to get to know the guys individually; a perfect reverse-harem setup, am I right?)  \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I was about to give up on this show, but episode 7 explained why she was the way she was. The storyline became interesting. However, it went downhill again after that. I only continued to watch it because the main storyline/plot was original. I have never seen a reverse harem like this (I\u2019m refraining from saying the spoiler). Yet, the originality of the show was overshadowed by the unoriginal and boring characters and dialogues. Not to mention, the storyline did not unfold nicely either. I guess the only thing that was okay was the open ending. Oh yeah, the art was different and nice too. Personally, the dichromatic eyes and hair looked beautiful. Also, I\u2019m still wondering why the heroine had two different shoes. Can anyone answer that?\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, this show was absolutely boring and ridiculous. I only gave it a high rating (yes, 7- 6 is way too high for it) because I\u2019m just tired of the typical reverse-harem, and I do applaud people that shed original content into a show (even if it is done poorly). Soooo, watch this show at your own risk.",

            "content": "Ah, Amnesia..probably one of the most boring shows that I have watched.\r\nBefore I start, I must say that I do indeed know that the writers for this anime had basically nothing to base this anime on; after all, it was an otome game, which can sometimes be quite superficial in terms of plot. However, they basically did nothing with it.\r\nPlot:\r\nWhen I first started watching Amnesia, it was because my guilty pleasure is watching reverse harem anime. Shows like Ouran, Kamigami no Asobi, and Free!! (if it can be defined as anything other than sports anime), which are on the more decent side of the spectrum.However, had I known that Amnesia had such a useless plot such as Diabolik Lovers, I wouldn't even have started watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI thought this anime was going to be about a girl getting her memories back. That is not what I saw. What I saw while watching this anime was a girl going from boyfriend to boyfriend, staying clueless the whole time. After all of this idiocy, the writers suddenly decided to cram a strange psycho policeman (??) into the mess and then try to pretend that the anime had a plot the entire time. I stopped caring completely about the anime around episode 5, but I forced myself to continue so that I could find out why she had amnesia. When I finished the anime, I thought to myself \"they explained it a bit...but I still have no idea what was really going on in that anime.\" Because her ex-boyfriend has magical powers or something that make time repeat itself. And people get thrown in a well. To this day, I haven't bothered to rewatch the abomination that is amnesia. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI have to say, the art for amnesia was really nice. The artstyle in general was very appealing, and one of the reasons why I picked up this anime in the first place. Only, the dudes all seemed to have the color scheme of \"one unique color plus black\". \\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe opening was catchy, but all the other soundtrack didn't really come to my attention.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nOkay, I know that the heroines of reverse harems often have really weak personalities. And 'nameless protagonist' is a prime example of a weak personality. We know literally nothing about her. She's just this ultimate doormat that doesn't stand up for herself when people assault/bully her (like being attacked with scissors and being locked IN A CAGE) and doesn't seem to have a conscience when she is, in a weird way, dating 5 (??) people at once. The other characters are just plain old strange. I don't find any of their personalities attractive. I didn't even bother to remember their names. Yellow is too obsessive/super creepy, white/blue dude can't seem to decide if he's the supportive wingman or the ladykiller, red is just....apathetic (??), and green...green seems like a tsundere, but they focus on him a lot less than they do on, say, yellow, so it's kinda hard to tell what he's all about. Orion is almost as mysterious/shallow as the protagonist. He's a spirit...but he does basically nothing but tell the protagonist \"oh hello you have amnesia\" although it might be pretty easy to tell if you have no memories whatsoever. And then there's psycho cop dude...I can't even talk about him. I don't get him at all.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this anime. It's not as bad as some, but it really is one of the dumbest things I've watched.",

The only reason I can find is, they are either getting confused by the story, or are guys who find this anime too \"girly\". (I'm a guy too and in the first few episodes I've been tempted to drop it because of this; Now I'm glad I didn't give in) \r\nStory:        While the idea is at the base fairly good, it's they way they present it that makes this anime excellent. I didn't experience this sensation \"What the hell is going on here?\" sinceI watched Steins;Gate, and I loved it. Now then, given that this sensation is the reason many people drop this anime (or the excuse, depending on how you look at it), I do not understand how this anime is so low while Steins;Gate is no less than no.2 in the list. Do an experiment and watch the two in a row. I'd be most honored if you could send me the results so I can post them here as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt&Sound: One word: Beautiful. That's all there is to say to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  The protagonist is indeed pretty much blank on backstory, but there's a good reason for that. She's a sweet girl any way you look at it though. \\n\r\n                     Then the four \"cards\": Shin-Hearts (Cups); Ikki-Spades (Swords); Kent-Clover (Clubs); Toma-Diamonds (Coins); \\n\r\n                     Now let's get ezoteric. Look at the description of these tarot cards:\\n\\n\r\n-Knight of Cups: Passionate, Profound, Calm on the outside but fiery in soul. In a relationship, it represents a beginning.\\n\\n\r\n-Knight of Swords: Rational, Brave, The one who valors victory above all else. In a relationship, it represents break-up. \\n\\n\r\n-Knight of Clubs: Intelligent, Noble, Speaks his mind regardless of situation. In a relationship, it represents uneasiness.\\n\\n\r\n-Knight of Coins: Persevering, Sure in own forces. in a relationship, it represents stability created in time. \\n\\n\r\n                   Sounds familiar? Thought as much. I also saw some connection of the episodes to the first 12 major arcanas, not counting 0 The Fool. I am quite an amateur though in the matter of tarot, so if you are more skilled and find something, tell me. (Pretty please?)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Start to Finish. Reason is obviously the storyline.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10. I'm open to discussion if you wish to.",

This is a case of the destination being worth more than the journey. Because the journey is bland and it sucks. \r\nThe core story has so much potential. I really love the premise of what is happening to the main character and the world. If the anime only revolved around the 'true lover' and the baseline plot, while leaving the other guys as support characters instead of trying so hard to be an otome, I think this could have beena very good show. \\n\\n\r\nAnd just because a character has amnesia it doesn't mean they have no personality.There's a right way and a wrong way to write amnesiacs. Most people write them the wrong way and treat them like stoic blank slates. This show is a prime example.",

I never watched an anime that involves \"time travelling\" so it was interesting to watch.\r\nStory: The story was made really great. It kinda had like this mystery theme to it. At first I couldn't really understand what's going on, but after couple episodes it became clear.\r\nThe end was kinda sad though. I wish it was a better end. And everyone's back round  story was amazing too...\r\nArt: I really liked characters eyes, hairs, cloths. It was something you don't see in every anime. The art in general was good. \r\nEnjoyment: It was fun to watch*SPOILERS* because the main girl kept waking up and not remembering anything what happened. And every time she woke up she was with another boyfriend. So it was really interesting to see how will it end.\\n\\n\r\nAfter all anime was great, I liked it, but I wasn't a fan of the end. In my opinion it could of been a lot better and it made me ask some questions about her past. I would like to see them make a second season where it would tell all about her pass and what actually happened to her after it...\\n\\n\r\nBut I do suggest to watch it.",

Like I understand what they meant in the very but you dont see which one she picks. ( I feel like it was Obvious who she picked) and i also i wish they showed us just a little bit of theworld she picked as well.

I was wrong. \r\nI enjoyed the characters, I found them interesting. The story I wish they would have worked on. After watching it all the way to the end and thinkinglogically, I understood the storyline and appreciated it a bit more but I don't think it had totally been executed to the fullest. It seemed her personality changed with each new storyline so even the person she was the begin with wasn't the girl that was in each of the worlds. \\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the open endedness of the ending. \\n\\n\r\nI wish they had fleshed out Orion and why he was there a bit more. I feel they needed a scape goat with him as to why she was going through time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it wasn't the worst series I have watched but I'm probably not going to watch it again.

You have beautiful art, atmosphere, music, making this dreamlike and calm setting. The gimmick isn't too original, but it is portrayed funkily, leading you on with a sense of mild confusion. The art and setting makes it bearable, even if the plot itself fails to interest you. Then you dress up all the love interests like edgy clowns, and give them exaggeratedly poor/fuckedup/asshole behaviors, and spin them around, and suddenly it becomes a circus of dreamlike weirdness.\r\nSee, the real mysteryof this show is between its characters. The main heroine is so vapid that her dulled responses to even the most abstractly abnormal weird-ass dudes that she cycles through, is just so out of place and dumb that it overpowers the setting and plot itself in terms of surrealism.\\n\\n\r\nIt is truly a unique experience, and i rather enjoyed it.",

            "content": "So if you looked at my rating of the anime, you'd notice that everything is 10 in my book.\r\nWhy? Well it's simple really. Amnesia is an outstanding anime that will literally blow your mind in the end. I know that in the beginning it seems like a simple plot, and the title doesn't really help at all in that aspect, but this is seriously a complex anime that fools everybody until the very end. \r\nAs for the story line, like I said earlier it doesn't seem like much. The heroin of the story apparently looses her memories, and goes on a journey to recover them.Now that right there sounds simple right? Really? Well it's not. For this anime, I highly advise you not to be fooled by the so called 'cliche' because this anime turns that concept into something so intriguing, and I guarantee that you will be hook by the third episode. The suspense is killer, and will utterly break you in the end. \\n\\n\r\nIt is very difficult to come across high definition art these days. I believe that the style this anime has completely enhances the story line. Sure you look up pictures on google and think the art is utter booty but you don't know how wrong you are. The art is amazing and completely helps the story line. Just go to hulu and do yourself a favor. You can get a free account, the only thing you would have to pay for is hulu plus, but you don't HAVE to get it. Amnesia is free on there, and that I promise you.\\n\\n\r\nNow as for the sound, I believe it's on point. The heroin's voice isn't so shrilly or high that it makes you want to kill yourself, and the voice actors did a really good job matching their voices to the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThis leaves us with character, and let me tell you now that each and every character is developed so much that it's scary. Each character has a different personality, and I guarantee that in the end you might be rooting for them to be the Heroin's boyfriend or intended. Heroine unlike most female anime characters is very likeable, and throughout the series I found myself crying in some parts. Just imagine me, the fiercest Firediva of them all crying because of some anime named Amnesia. It's the feels people, the feels. \\n\\n\r\nI'm going to do enjoyment and overall in one paragraph because I feel like I enjoyed the overall series. The characters were on point, and the plot was too. Even now 1 year later, my mind is still reeling from shock, and i'm about to watch it again on hulu. Just know that you will LOVE amnesia, and if your mind is so blown that you just NEED to talk about it, feel free to contact me. I know what it feels like.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclsion, WATCH THE ANIME!!!",

            "content": "Okay so my review will not be extremely detailed but then again, this anime wasn't very detailed either so I don't feel it deserves it.  \r\nStory:The idea of this show seemed interesting to me because I, like many people who are probably reading this while trying to decide if they should watch it, love reverse harems! However, it is hard to get into the many romance partners the heroine has when the main girl herself doesn't know much about them and doesn't seem to gain any information about them(which you think would be important especially because maybe just maybe it would help her gether memories back...which she doesn't seem to concerned with).   The story jumps every time she dies.  This means that she could be the super hot dude one minute, end up getting killed and wake up in her bed to find out she has a whole new relationship!  So you don't like the blue haired guy? Not your cup of tea? Just jump in front of a bus and you get a shot at another guy(this isn't a spoiler I am just throwing it out there I promise).\\n\r\nArt: All I can say is that the eyes are godly and this show is beautiful eye candy.  The men are all amazing and the art almost makes up for the heroines lack of personality(and name)!\\n\r\nSound: Meh no complaints, I wasn't as amazed as I was with the art but it really isn't bad.\\n\r\nCharacter: Okay so the guys can be considered the \"typical\" harem group but then again there is more to them then just that.  They are attractive, seductive, and most importantly just want to throw themselves at the Heroine.  I mean that is all that really matters right? Right? Q.Q\\n\r\nBut anyway I digress.....the main problem I had was with the Heroine....who would've probably been better off if she was mute.  She wasn't very interesting and if it weren't for the guys I would've dropped this show way sooner than I had.\\n\r\nOverall: Hey it is a bunch of hot guys throwing themselves at a girl with no name!  Guess it makes it easier to place yourself in her shoes when the guys aren't saying her name every second...I mean come on everyone knows that ruins the moment!  Okay but seriously, you can find a much better reverse harem somewhere else but if you really want to try it then go for it! You may actually like it so don't let everyone' s negativity(including mine) stop you!",

But no I pushed though and actually learnt to love this.\r\nSo the story.. \r\n.. Without going too deep the protagonist which was kept nameless. (Often referred to as Heroine) has been involved in an accident and guess what? Yeah she has amnesia.. You didn't see that one coming did you?\r\nThroughout the anime she is continuously pulled back to the day august 1st and to her discovery! she's with a different man, the personally of her friends has changed slightly..\\n\\n\r\nI've only given this a 6 because there is no real story until later into the anime but because she has amnesia a real story would not work so yeah. \\n\\n\r\nArt!\\n\\n\r\nWell then. Amazing.. beautiful colours and contrasts the best part in my opinion.(10)\\n\\n\r\nSound!\\n\\n\r\nCan't think of any qualms here. The soundtrack is nice and matches the style of the anime. I can't complain. (10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter.. \\n\\n\r\nNow again like the story character development is lacking but yeah, She does have amnesia and as the writer wants you to be in a state of confusion much like heroine. \\n\\n\r\nOrion the fairy has to be one of my favorite anime character personalities of the year! Herorine has no real character she spends most of the anime confused with very little input. This perhaps could have been worked on so for that i will only give this a 7.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nAs I've already stated at the start of this review I found it very difficult to continue watching at the first few episodes, later in the anime it starts to get repetitive but then as the story starts to unfold i really couldn't wait for next weeks episode. In terms of enjoyment for spring 2013 it's pretty much 3rd place. But then again the competition this spring was kinda lame anyway. (8)\\n\\n\r\nOverall.\\n\\n\r\nTrying to be non bias as possible I'm considering how others would feel watching it and honestly I don't see everyone liking this. If you like beautiful artwork then give it a go because that really made this anime for me. So for that I have only given it a 7.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading, This was only my second review I hope I'm improving comment on my profile if you feel like leaving feedback. Good bye!",

            "content": "TLDR; For actually understanding the story and characters, the otome is more recommended. The anime did a poor job of expressing this making everything fall flat. Art and music are good however.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n I originally watched the show first. I thought it was interesting and I really liked the music and art.\r\nHowever, now I decided to read the otome and seriously? The anime leaves so many gaps and what made the story in the otome interesting. The anime just flounces around not really getting to the point with any of them. It is just confusing. \r\nArt:\r\nThe art is probably the best part of the entire show.I love the gradients for coloring and the interesting eyes. \\n\r\nAs for animation though.... What is going on with their walking?\\n\r\nIt gets very shaky, making it very hard to look at.   9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThoroughly enjoyed it. The opening is still one of my favourites of all time. It is very catchy. The ending not as much. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIn the anime they ruined majority of them T m T In the anime Shin never get better and showing how caring he is, they just make him this very forceful character and it's just bad. A lot of his story that was in the otome is never explained nor does it explain any of the character's story version of how she got amnesia -,- \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are rushed through and almost as if they anime creators didn't bat much of an eye to the otome.\\n\\n\r\nThey totally left Kent in the dust. There's so much they could have done and they barely gave him screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThe most closely tied to the otome would have to be Toma.  He's also the only one where they went through his whole story but very fast...\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else was screwed over  very badly and it didn't help they tried to rush each character's story into 1 1/2- 2 eps -,- And they didn't even get their full story either... Like the first maybe 10 mins of playthrough of the otome...\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the fact that in the anime Orion just pops in and out? Like what is with that?  Orion is supposed to be around majority of the time..\\n\\n\r\nOverall to just put it quickly the anime killed the characters making them more bland. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nUkyo's story probably was the most engaging episodes for me.\\n\r\nBefore I knew about the anime, I was intrigued. I found the characters interesting all in their own ways and the art style really brought me in, but not having read the otome... oh boy... how did I like this anime?  After reading, it became less appealing and making me question thoroughly why the anime cut out sooooo much. No wonder everyone finds it super confusing and hard to follow.",

            "content": "Amnesia is a Japanese visual novel series by Idea Factory with a total of six games. The anime is from the studio Brain's Base and has twelve episodes + an OVA. Now, I liked Amnesia and thought it was pretty well paced for a twelve episode anime. Though one thing that pissed me off is that we never found out the main characters name. \r\nStory line: Amnesia's story line was very intriguing. The thought of a girl having lost her memories and jumping from parallel worlds is very interesting. Personally I liked the plot for this anime. It kept me going and keeping me invested.Not knowing what's exactly going on and being on the same page as the main character was very exciting. Also stressful.  Now the how Neil thing did randomly come up, there suddenly being this man who was the one who caused the main character to jump from world to world was random but did give us answers. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters weren't my favorite part of this anime. The two I think stand out the most would be Ukyo and Shin. Shin is the first world we get and he is very interesting. From his style of clothing to his personality really made me invested in his story line. I never got bored when he was on screen. Aside from him we have Ukyo who takes the cake. A guy with a two part personality, one good and one bad was amazing. One time he was nice and next thing you knew he was threatening the main character with a knife. He was my favorite character in this anime and kept me liking him until the very end. Kent was a pretty interesting guy as well. The way he talked and thought was very interesting, though I was pretty angry that he only got one episode to talk about him and the main character. Ikki I personally hated but his story line was interesting. While the story about his eyes were weird, it was also very cool. Don't even get me started on Toma. At first I liked him and then his story line came along. I'm not even gonna talk about it go watch the anime if you haven't already. Now the main character who I personally call Chloe, since she looks like one to me, was what I think you'd call dumb but smart. At times I wanted to punch her and knock some sense into her, but at other points I was on her side. I never hated her though, since she went through pretty tough stuff.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: The animation was normal, like what you'd find in lots of other animes but what really got me was the character designs. Each character had a distinctive look to them. From the way they dressed and talked, it gave them all memorable ways I'd say. Now the eye designs really remind me of the Diabolik Lovers eyes, did anyone else feel that?\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The soundtrack was average. My favorite piece of music would have to be the instrumental version of the opening. Now don't get me wrong, the opening was really great and catchy, but the instrumental version has you going with feelings especially with the final scene between Orion and Chloe. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I truly recommend this anime. If you like mystery and romance, you'll like Amnesia. \\n",

            "content": "Five Guys, One Girl a Fairy and Amnesia.\r\nPretty much this sums up the whole story. \r\nStory:The story starts with a girl that wakes up and remembers nothing. The story is the typical I don't remember things so I say yes and agree w/ everything trying to act cool but you can clearly see that I don't remember basic things bout myself. Care you find the Heroine (we don't actualy get our heroine's name so we just call her that). Every time a loop happens and we find ourselves on zero starting from scratch, trying to undestand what will happen. Note that each time a newguy is interested in our heroine. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in this anime is pretty amazing. The characters have very nice looks and exceptionaly beautiful eyes. Just watching this anime's art makes you wanna give it a try 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Not sth to be amazed at except for the OP sung by Yanagi Nagi, Zeotrope is a rly amazing OP that'll be stuck in your mind for a little while. Now the OST in the anime is nothing to be amazed at, fairly good, nothing better but nothing worse though. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Charter Development is sure not the strong point of this show. We get to see a little on the guys backstory but not so that you can like them or feel sth for them. Our heroine though get zero charcter development, as I said we don't even get to know her name. In each story she starts growing some feelings bt after the loops takes place it's like nothing ever happened. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Well IDK why but I actually kinda enjoyed this anime, the amazing art and OP made me want to see more of this and see wether our heroine gets any character development, sadly she never does. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's worth the time to watch this but not to go crazy about it, you'll watch it, like it for the moment and then forget about it until you hear the OP or see a character and remember everything. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHope this helps you out.

            "content": "Amnesia is what you would call \"self insertion romance\" I suppose, except don't go in without protection.\r\nAfter watching Spice and Wolf for the first time, I was pining for a good romance fix.  This was not it.  :(\r\nAs a lonely alcoholic 30-something chick, it's normally easy for me to live and love vicariously through the characters in these kinds of shows, but this one was different.  Maybe it was the thought of being surrounded by oddly dressed emaciated youths.  Or maybe the guys just weren't all that great.  Maybe it's the fact that they never gave the MC a name,poor girl.  (That's analogous to not drawing the eyes in hentai, by the way.)  Either way, this one just didn't draw me in.  She is totally unrelatable to me.  Besides, I'm not half as cute as she is.  And that hair of hers---always perfect, always in that perfect little flower bun.  She can sleep for days on end and still looks fucking perfect.  Bitch.  Also, those socks do NOT go with that dress.\\n\\n\r\nThe only guy I didn't find any hangups with was Kent.  He was really weird, but adorable.  (\"Adorkable?\")  I would totally hang out in his office all day just because.  By the way, that boy is no grad student.  That is a young professor's office if I've ever seen one.  All he needs is another 20 years of refusing to be moved out of the same office, and things will begin to take (lose?) shape.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the story a 2 because they managed to get the structure right for one of these kinds of shows.  i.e.: Establish a \"blank slate\" MC as a substrate for insertion of viewer's self, enumerate all of the boys, and then contrive a situation where the MC gets to learn more about each of them individually---their fears, flaws, secrets, heal their hearts, whatever.  It's almost forgivable if the overarching story doesn't make any goddamned sense, but in this show there are some really glaring plot holes even within the span of a single scene that made impossible the suspension of disbelief.  And honestly, this kind of thing works way better for otome games than it does for anime or manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt gets a 4, because the cards motif was a passable (but likely) metaphor for all the plot shuffling this show does.  However, the delivery was kind of messy, almost like they weren't confident in their idea of what playing cards actually are.  Hmm.\\n\\n\r\nSound gets a 4.  I watched the English dub, which was...well, I don't want to call it \"bad\" because I respect the work of the VAs on this project.  It's almost like the dub was an independent satire of the original work.  It was hilariously bad, because the characters were bad.  It was like watching Samsung's video on how to return your exploding Galaxy Note 7.  If you are an English speaker then I recommend that you watch the English dub, or else you will be missing out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters get a 2....Kent scores a single point here for the whole team.  I really liked Kent.  Minus him, everyone else makes it a 1.  The ones who are supposed to be likable are creepy or insane.  Everyone else is bland.  This series is way too short to have this many characters.  I would prefer to see more depth with fewer characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment gets a 4, in the same way that terrible movies can be enjoyable to gawk at.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think the story and the characters create the maximum score for this show, in spite of the somewhat more amusing things going on with the art and the voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nIf-and-only-if you're the kind of person who's into watching bad movies or shows just to make fun of them, then I would recommend Amnesia.",

            "content": "One of the things I like to point out before judging anime that is based off of an otome game is that potential viewers/readers should realize exactly what I just wrote: the anime is based off of an otome game. That said, there are certain conventions that usually follow, which explain why certain parts of the story function the way that they do.\r\nFor an otome anime, I would say that Amnesia wasn't terrible. I have watched much worse. I thought that the art and the music was quite good, so in that respect we can at least say that it isn't complete garbage. \r\nI liketo defend otome anime because I play otome games and I don't think there's anything wrong with creating an anime for people who can't/don't want to play the game(s). I see anime based off of otome games as a way for people to be introduced to the general plotline and characters (notice that I said general). So I'll go through what people complain about with this anime most often.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist/heroine has no personality: This is a convention of otome games. The protagonist (unfortunately) usually has weak personality so that the player (or viewer) can project themselves onto the character. It's difficult for players to relate to a heroine that has a very strong personality because the heroine might otherwise say/do things that is unrelatable to the player. \\n\\n\r\nThe plotline is confusing/doesn't make sense: Unfortunately Amnesia has a generally confusing plotline AND the anime is trying to give viewers a general idea of the game while cutting corners. I think you can understand where the short-comings arise. That said, I have not actually played the games (yet) and I understood the plot perfectly fine. In most otome games you won't understand what is going on in situations like Amnesia until the very end. I play a lot of otome games, so I understood this convention when I started to watch the anime and I accepted it. I understand that it irritates other people who don't like to see this in anime because obviously anime isn't the same thing as an otome game. \\n\\n\r\nThe other characters/guys are boring/weird: These characters also follow certain conventions. If you play a lot of otome games, you will notice a general pattern with the kind of characters/guys available for the heroine/player to date. I thought the guys in Amnesia were fairly standard. This doesn't necessarily mean they aren't \"boring,\" but I thought a few of their personalities were to be expected. \\n\\n\r\nSexual harassment in the series: This is probably a controversial point for me to make, but it is difficult to apply Western feminism to anime because Japan does not conform to these ideas. I'm not saying that particular things in the series are NOT sexual harassment/problematic, but I think that many viewers forget that this anime was not created with Western ideas in mind. For example, many people complain about (SPOILERS) the part in the anime when Toma puts the heroine in a cage. He is basically holding her hostage. Have the reaction you want to this information - but in Japan, this is serving a certain demographic of people who like very problematic/forceful love interests - even delving into the yandere genre. I'm not ready to police the production of games/anime/entertainment on the basis of those fantasies being problematic, but that's just my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nConcluding thoughts: I think that as an anime, Amnesia is fairly mediocre. Taking into account that it is made based off of an otome game, I don't think it's that bad. I think that there are some better ones, but it isn't the worst. It follows the same conventions that all the otome games I have played follow. I don't think it should be faulted for those things. \\n\\n",

It's mostly of what you would expect of this genre, the main character is quite dull, considering that it's an otome adaptation, where you make the mc's desicions.

            "content": "Okay, so Amnesia. Stumbled upon it from a cool lookin wallpaper. Lets get into my review, and trust me when i say this, i think my view on it is a little bit different from others.\r\nStory 8/10: I am actually giving it a 8/10 just because it has a unique concept and i must say that they carried it out pretty nice. Read the \"Synopsis\"/discription of the anime. The story is told to the viewer like you are apart of the \"memorie loss\". Becasue of this story might appear quite slow and you really dont understand that much troughout alot of episodes and alot ofpeople dislike that. I think the studio had a unique concept and they carried it out great. The way it was presentet to the viewer gives you  alot of new/different thoughts, feelings and emotions that no other anime has given me. Therefor my score.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: I'm not giving this a 10 just because i have seen alot of other animes with more appealing artsyles to me. But i think that the small touches that they had i gave it more depth. For example, some characters (everyone but the main character i believe) has different \"styled\" eyes and everyone has really cool clothes, and i really think that it gave the anime more personality and depth. I really loved that, very different, i have not seen anything like this... yet.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: I'm giving out one more 7 here, let me tell you why. When you dont care about the sound in an anime, that is when it is just right. Let me explain. The music should amplify the current feelings and situations in an anime, and i think when you dont really pay attention to it and only get \"the feels\", that is when they get it right. Once again, i have seen anime that has done a better job at this but i think that Amnesia did a great job to!\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: Amnesia really gives the viewer time to get to know each character that the protagonist meets, just because that is how the story is written. I felt that they all had their own styles and feelings and relations with the protagonist and i think that they did a great job on this! I also loved their clothing styles, as previously mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: Amnesia gave me a bit of everything i want in an anime. Love, drama, psycho, magic/fantasy, it gets you thinking wich gets you even more engaged the story. If i wouldn't have enjoyed it i would have dropped it, and i have dropped a few other \"popular\" animes out there. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I had a little bit of everything i want in an anime and i liked it alot. And that is why i am writing this review, this is the first and only anime that gave me new and differend feelings and that had everything that i ask for in an anime. It was not perfect but it was great! And that is why im writing this review, its one of few i think deserve a little bit highers score than it has! Great work! Thanks for reading and have a great one!",

            "content": "I am writing this review because there are certainly two different sides to whether or not Amnesia will be enjoyable for you, and I would like to offer a little more perspective into it after seeing this argument with 'The game was better, but the anime deserves recognition too.'\r\nI've rewatched this a few times since I first came across it as a newly made anime addict. Amnesia was a lot of firsts for me: reverse harem, romance, or just the first anime I ever watched through completely.\r\nWhat put me at a disadvantage is I went into the series completely trusting the synopsis that had beenprovided; a show covering an amnesiac and her many beautiful LI? Count me in.\\n\r\nExcept the show wasn't nearly as simple as that.\\n\\n\r\nSince then I've played through the otome game Amnesia: Memories it was based off, rewatched the show knowing the source material, and come up with my final opinion.\\n\\n\r\nIn this review I will be comparing the game and the anime as a way to explain my reservations. I understand that this might be an annoying thing to do for the fans of the anime, or a casual reader, but I really want to show you that this story is DEFINITELY worth forming your own opinion about because the two types of media are very different in how they present the story and I want you to choose the one that will help you enjoy the story the best.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe moment it became clear that the show was going to try and squeeze in hours and hours of character development for each guy's personal route within 12 episodes AND STILL TRY TO MAKE IT ONE COHERENT STORY is ridiculous. You'd need far more episodes to try and pull it off. \\n\r\nAs a new anime fan last year, the idea that the MC was jumping from character to character without really acknowledging the LI that came before the current one made me very baffled, not to mention disoriented.\\n\r\nIt is EXHAUSTING trying to keep up with a show that hasn't really explained anything about what is going on - instead leaving us to rely on Orion for random tidbits of information when relevant.\\n\\n\r\nIt is extremely frustrating to watch a show that constantly shifts what is true and isn't true due to the amount of parallel universes that are constantly being introduced. It's no wonder, when Shin's route (the first one you'll watch) finishes and the MC is suddenly taken to a completely different world, and takes everything in her stride that yes Ikki is now her boyfriend...? As a viewer, I didn't even realise that the anime included jumping from parallel world to parallel world (although I'm inclined to believe that this could be my mistake as well). I was extremely confused.\\n\\n\r\nAny thoughts of satisfaction you might have had after investing yourself a few episodes deep (and thinking you were actually progressing the plot) is taken away, and suddenly you have to start from scratch, figuring out how this new parallel world works; who the MC is friends with now; who her enemies are; who works at the cafe with her or not... all these things change every few episodes as she goes through each world.\\n\r\nNothing is steadfast, and when you binge this show like I did, there isn't enough time to process it and hence how I managed to watch a show that made me really uncomfortable and cramped with the pacing. Playing the game gives you a lot more breathing room to consume the story and fully understand what is actually going on.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there is no payoff.\\n\r\nIn the game as you might expect, you choose one single character route, play through it and depending on the choices you made, get a good ending or a bad ending *with that character*. There is a payoff to the hours of reading and playing you've put into the story - you get a snippet of what the MC's life is like after spending so long gathering memories and reforming relationships.\\n\\n\r\nNo such luck with the anime.\\n\r\nTrying to keep the spoilers to a minimum, the MC does not end up with anyone. We don't see what happens when she returns to her own world with her memories. And that is the frustrating thing when you end up spending around 4 hours trying to keep up with multiple storylines and the ending throws it all away and tells you that it never really mattered.\\n\\n\r\nART AND SOUND 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI am pleased to say I cannot utter a single complaint about the art or sound. The OP and ED are GORGEOUS. The OP is something I end up listening to on a regular basis ever since I came across it, and even in the soundtrack there are some gems - Ukyo's Melody for example? I wish it had been in the game because it suited the general mood of the story beyond perfectly.\\n\r\nAnd you only have to look at the art to realise how wonderful it is. Amnesia probably has my favourite art in an anime ever and I love the style of each of the characters - especially the choice of colours. Aesthetically pleasing? Absolutely.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I get into my real issues with the show. The MC and Orion. You're gonna end up spending a lot of time with these two so naturally they have to be strong characters, or moderately okay characters, right?\\n\r\nDid the game do this? Without a doubt.\\n\r\nDid the anime? *laughs*\\n\\n\r\nIf you're wondering why Orion is even in the show to begin with asides from plot convenience at the beginning, that's how you know something is wrong. To give you an idea of his role in the game, Amnesia: Memories was very loose with their characterisation of the MC. In the game, Orion is basically the player's window into the world; and is the voice of narration for most of the game. He'd guide the player through scenes, explain the consequences of specific choices, and says his piece when Toma did that one thing and the MC forgives him anyway.\\n\r\nUntil the ending has arrived, the MC barely says a thing, which I thought to be a very refreshing idea for an otome game.\\n\\n\r\nBut obviously, that leaves the writers at a disadvantage for the anime because they have to try and bring to life this MC character who was basically just a shell for players like me to hide behind to play through the game as.\\n\r\nProblems immediately arise with Orion in the anime - it isn't a game, so there are no choices to be made, and his comments about the current situation are brought to a minimum, making his character suffer dramatically.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I watched the anime the first time through, I hated Orion. He was completely pointless, and I couldn't understand why he was around when all he did was argue that she couldn't go the hospital (this point is explored further in the game, but there are some routes in the game where even he ends up agreeing that a visit to the hospital for other health stuff would benefit her.) without explaining further.\\n\\n\r\nThen I played the game, expecting to hate him (I literally chose mean dialogue options my first playthrough because I was that annoyed with him in the anime) and I ended up being in tears over him at the ending. It made me more frustrated rewatching to see such a vital character brought down due to the necessity of giving the MC a more active role in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it wouldn't have been so bad if the MC wasn't so frustrating to watch.\\n\r\nHer speciality includes blinking cluelessly when asked a simple question and staying silent, staring into space, and asking Orion what she should do for the simplest of tasks. Again this comes down to the idea that she is barely a character in the game, and the writers probably thought they could get away with it in the anime because 'Hey, she has amnesia so what do you expect?\" \\n\r\nShe still had more of a personality in the game - emotional attachment to a character (Orion doesn't count in this example) and an incentive to recover her independent mind without constant mothering by Orion.\\n\\n\r\nThe guys in question have similarly annoying habits, and I actually ended up making a pretty intense workout routine (non-related but I wanted to hint at the idea for people rewatching anyway)  everytime something annoying happened because something happened every few seconds i.e: Shin brooding for no reason, Orion stating the obvious, Toma and Shin fighting for no apparent reason other than to make Toma look like a nice guy and Shin the broody guy, all the guys acting very patronising (and then kissing them like right after), Ikki being fangirled over, or Kent being an arrogant know-it-all.\\n\\n\r\nThe game elaborates on these behaviours, why Toma and Shin fight, Ikki's loneliness, and Kent's obliviousness to the idea that he even said something rude and feeling a little insecure (before offering to fix said behaviour if it was too much).\\n\\n\r\nThat's why the short time spent on each character makes the show suffer so much. At the end of the show (with the exception of possibly Shin who I felt had the strongest route in the show) there isn't someone who you'd really want to see again with the MC anyway. They come across as very weak, frivolous characters with no thought behind them whatsoever when in fact it's the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL ENJOYMENT 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI was conflicted rating this anime, because it had so much potential and it got reduced to a 12 episode waste of time, yet the game is so enjoyable that I keep thinking that maybe it's just in my head and I'll enjoy it if I rewatch it one more time which never happens. No matter how much I remind myself I disliked this anime, I keep coming back to it which makes me think that it must have done something right.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are new to anime, do NOT watch this first. Get some more anime under your belt, so that it doesn't leave you with a bad impression of the reverse harem genre, and try to watch it knowing what you're getting into.\\n\r\nI would suggest Amnesia: Memories - the otome game, for someone who is serious about getting into the story and character plots. \\n\r\nIf you're just looking for a quick non-commital reverse harem anime to get through then you might just be okay.\\n\\n",

Otome games are often hard to make into good anime adaptions, many people already hold a certain expectation because of the game. \r\nAmnesia is strange in the way that there is no clear plot to the anime and it seems like the creators attempted to include each character's route in the series. With multiple dimensional/time changes, various guys, and no solid plot this was a failure. I have no other way to say it, this anime was just a general trainwreck. I have played thegames and enjoyed them, I have seen a few other otome to anime adaptions, and I still feel disappointed from this. Normally I would write a much longer, detailed review but I honest to god cannot describe to you how poor this anime is. As I said, I played the game and knew the general background information of this anime and it was still confusing.\\n\\n\r\nYour only hope for understanding this anime at all is playing the games, and even then you still probably won't get it because the creators crammed five different otome routes into 12 poorly done episodes.",

As an adaption of a Otome Game you can't ask for more,just a view for all the rutes. It shows what It wants pretty well and nothing more. If you don't like simple storys that goes from nothing then this is not your anime. I am very surprised of people talking about the boys sense of style,does that really matter when watching an anime? At reading at all the reviews I wonder if I was the only onewho cry on the last episode,it was full of feelings  for me. There sometimes that I get tired of  storys  that shows basically the same but Amnesia got me there till the end. That I would watch it again? No. I recommend it to you if you're not so demanding.  This is not exactly a shoujo anime so don't watch it expecting romance,just watch it is you want to see a girl trying to remember her past in different worlds with  diferent boys with no really conection between everything. \\n",

            "content": "I rarely feel like writing a review, but I wanted to stand for Amnesia. First I watched Amnesia in 2013, didn't really like it and gave it a 5. After four years, I played the game, in shock by how I completely forgot everything, most of the story, the characters, the ending -truly an amnesia right... Then I rewatched the whole show, and now I'm seeing it in a whole different light. Therefore I must say it before I start; This is an anime based on a visual novel, so please bear that in mind.\r\nStory = 9\r\nThe part I love the most in Amnesia isprobably the story. It is hooking, it never gets boring and never fails to surprise. The usage of parallel universes in this type of reverse harem storyline is pure genius. It is creative and it gets you wondering what will happen in a different setting all the time, and you could never guess. \\n\\n\r\nThe other side of the coin is how they patched all stories into one story fitting in continuous sequences. In a game basis, every world is different and you go through a character, get to see an ending and start again. It is surprising that anime does not fail in portraying it. Whole anime is connected and open-ended so that you could enjoy it with an unbiased eye.\\n\\n\r\nArt = 6\\n\\n\r\nArt in the anime is fairly bad comparing to the game. I know it is not easy to create good visuals in anime every time, but somehow studios fail to bring the most catching component of the game ~the art~ to the anime (eg. Dramatical Murder) But, the origin is very creative, characters are drawn pretty well for most of the time, but I can't really say it was great. I really wish it could be better, then I could've enjoyed it far more.\\n\\n\r\nSound = 9\\n\\n\r\nVoices are so fitting to the characters and music is very great in creating the atmosphere. I'm just very happy that they are loyal to the original voice actors/actresses. I would cry if any of them had been changed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter = 8\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the main character, \"heroine, you\" whatever you want to call her is plain and mainstream to a fist clenching and facepalming level, I couldn't bring myself to hate it, maybe I am just used to it by now. This is not the first time a female heroine has such a character. Well, lucky for us, especially the main love interests are quite the looker and every other character besides the heroine are lively and loveable. I personally love how they come up with the idea of the manager, Waka-san.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 7\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed rewatching after playing the game and actually being able to get video remakes of CG's is pure bliss. Again if the art was better it could've been very nice, but that is just my humble opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall = 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall I liked it and can proudly say it was very good. It might come as fast pacing and some scenes would have left hanging in the air for the ones who haven't played the game, but I don't think this is something to be that critical about. I believe the raison d'\u00eatre of this anime is meant for the players, to begin with. I'm feeling quite positive about Amnesia, therefore I'm having high hopes in getting more of this genre in the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let me just say this first: I get where everyone is coming from when they that 1) the plot is slow and 2) the main heroine is bland.  But I'd like to put my own thoughts out here based on what I have felt while experiencing this story and world unfold.\r\nFirst off, like many of you may know, this anime is based off a visual novel.  More specifically, an otome game; a dating simulator story aimed towards a female audience.  Let me say straight up: the visual novel incredibly enjoyable.  The characters are great, the art is great, andthe story moves in a very exciting way.  Now, what happened to the anime you might ask.  In my own personal opinion, I feel like the fact that the original medium was this particular visual novel, the anime was bound to be less than amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is because otome games have multiple men that you can choose and date, different routes.  These routes all have different plots and a different scenario that the heroine is thrust into.  What the anime tries to do is combine all of these routes into one overarching story, and that's what makes the anime appear to move by in a very slow pace, like nothing is happening at all.  By putting her in every route, it adds confusion, unlike the visual novel.  With a visual novel, a player chooses one man/route, and plays it to the end until they get to an ending.  Then they restart and do another route.  With an anime, the main heroine is not played by the viewer, and so picking a specific route for her to go through on her own may upset some who like other routes, so she just goes through them all.  This adds a sense of \"I want more, but I guess that's it\". \\n\\n\r\nI appreciate the fact that there is an anime adaptation for the game, but now I understand that it's difficult to make an anime for these types of games.  However, I enjoyed the show nonetheless, especially since I played the game and got to see my favorite characters come to life on the screen.  It brought back memories of the time I spent playing the game, and makes me want to play it again, so I can truly see each individual story in a more fleshed out way.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime isn't my favorite, but I still appreciate the effort the creators took to adapt this particular otome game in this way.  If you found yourself interested in the story of this world, but were disappointed by the lack of depth, then play the game.  I fell in love with every character and every plot while playing the game, so letting a lackluster adaptation of a nearly impossible game to make an adaptation of make me love this world less, is not going to happen.      \\n",

            "content": "As is the problem with most otome game based anime, the protagonist has little to no strong personality traits in order to allow for a harmonious relationship with all kinds of people with all kinds of personalities. Keeping this in mind, I think Amnesia was made extremely well. \r\nThere is a legitimate and believable reason for the protagonist's personality which, as you probably guessed, is that she has amnesia. It makes it much easier to understand the world and the characters because the viewer and the protagonist are both trying to understand what in the world is going on while trying to get to knowthe characters and the setting. \\n\\n\r\nThe story I think is pretty decent and there was a good bit of thriller and mystery. It was pretty well paced and fit the atmosphere of the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nArt was outstanding though I do think it has to do with preference. While I really liked the characters' eyes and fashion, I don't think everyone is of the same opinion. Regardless, I do think we can agree that the art was well done and the motions were fluid.\\n\\n\r\nSound was very good and the OP and ED fit the anime well. As is a popular marketing tactic, Amnesia has some nice character songs that you may want to check out. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were unique compared to each other but cliche if you look at the genre as a whole. You got tsundere, flirt, yandere (two actually) and a stuck up smartass. While this doesn't sound good, each of the characters do have a certain amount of depth which I think is appropriate considering both the duration of the anime and what it was based off of. \\n\\n\r\nAs a side note, I highly recommend picking up the game. After watching the anime I became curious and so decided to give the game a try. It allows for a much more in depth understanding of the characters so if you want more background, I recommend the game. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the series and I think it is one of the most well made reverse harem anime based off of a game thanks to its original concept. It blended in the bland and boring protagonist with its story fluidly, which I think is very impressive considering that has always been one of the weak points for most, if not all anime of the same genre.",

            "content": "So basically you wake up amnesiac and suddenly you have all these crazily hot guys surrounding you trying to get in your pants. A typical reverse harem anime like Norn 9, Diabolik Lovers, and Kamigami no Asobi. Literally, the visual novel is better than this rushed 12 episodes anime.\r\nStory | 06\r\n   It is unique as to waking up losing all your memories with a spirit to help decide your decisions for you. What could've been better is to make each episode a part of every character's road. For instance, first few episodes of Shin and then the next few of Toma. Not jumpfrom character to character wondering who is the boyfriend. I do think, they probably made the anime this way so people would be inclined to purchase the dating sim online [Which I already played through on Steam].\\n\\n\r\nArt | 09\\n\r\n   The art isn't the best, but I enjoyed how cute the main character is. Her outfit choosing isn't bad and the maid concept is kawaii. THE MEN ARE HOT TOO SO THAT'S A PLUS [ Hint : I like Shin, Toma, and Ikki's routes]. The backgrounds are the same bunch and nothing too detailed. \\n\\n\r\nSound | 07\\n\r\n   Ohkay the music was mediocre. The opening was fine and I actually liked the ending more than the opening. Maybe some dramatic or soothing music would've been nice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter | 05\\n\r\n   The main character will piss you off in the anime. Her character in the visual novel is so much better. She's very weak, which is normal being amnesiac, but everyone just comes to her rescue like? There isn't any character development at all, you just go from guy to guy, very rushed, back story and all, and it's just that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment | 06\\n\r\n   I enjoyed the visual novel more than I enjoyed the anime. I didn't understand anything at all that went down in the anime until I played the game. Literally, from guy to guy, no stable plot nor character development. It's better to get the game, legit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall | 07\\n\r\n   I wouldn't watch this again. Like i've said probably xxx times already, get the game for better story, plot, and character development.",

            "content": "This anime left me confused, and concerned. Throughout this whole anime, I was very confused with the plot and story line, which was smashed into a number of 12 episodes, which included attractive men. Now I have nothing against harems. Harems are simply amazing, but this one I really didn't enjoy as much as the harems I have watched before, Kiniro no primo passo, brothers conflict, glass no kamen, kimi no todoke, skip beat. The list goes on for hours.\r\nThis anime was a complete confusion to me. In my opinion the protagonist was a little slow. When she was getting completely hit on, or flirtedwith, she just acted like she never saw what was happening, which made me want to hit the screen and smash my head through my window.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist made this anime harder to watch. I would have liked this anime to have had more interesting scenes, but because this anime was made in a matter of a few days at the least, everything was built together and slapped on, with a ribbon.\\n\\n\r\nWhen something actually interesting was about to happen, the main character, was so oblivious to the situation that it ruined the romance, and the somewhat comedy.\\n\\n\r\nWhen things were actually interesting, It was just falling apart because the characters were honestly retarded.\\n\r\nThe only thing I can complain about, is how the protagonist wasn't smart and oblivious.\\n\r\nI understand that she has amnesia, but I think in situations, if I was even remotely in a situation like, being beat up, or getting kissed, I would do something.\\n\r\nBut in this situation, she did nothing, and sat like a throw pillow for 12 episodes that never actually ended on the right foot.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is just a bunch of pretty boys, and a dumb, a very dumb, and oblivious main character, whom I don't remember the name to.\\n\\n\r\nThe art wasn't terrible, the sound was alright, but the whole situation was annoying, I completely understand not remembering things, but the main character as I said, was very oblivious to the most easiest situations.\\n\\n\r\nLike she just sat there, like my pillow and did nothing but stare for 12 episodes.\\n\r\nLike girl, do something. YOU NEED TO STOP JUST STARING.\\n\\n\r\nIt made me so annoyed, that it took me like a day to finish the anime, when It usually takes me a few days, when I really don't want to finish an anime.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it if you like boring animes, But ugh.

            "content": "A spark of consciousness ignites, and as you open your eyes, the darkness fades, revealing a blurry, out of focus face. As your eyes adjust to the light, you can see concern giving way to relief in the expression of... Who? Who is this person standing over you, and why is she wearing such a funny costume? She calls out to another person in the room, stating \u201cShe\u2019s awake,\u201d and you take a second to wonder where you are. This isn\u2019t the first time your mind had to catch up with you when you woke up somewhere unusual... Or is it? It certainly feels likeyou\u2019ve been through this before, but have you? And has it ever taken this long to fully regain consciousness?\\n\\n\r\nYou start to think about getting up and going home, only to realize with a sudden shock that you can\u2019t remember where you live. Do you live alone in an apartment? Do you still live with your parents? Who ARE your parents? And for that matter, who are you? Just as you\u2019re noticing that you\u2019re wearing the same funny costume as the girl who woke you up, you hear male voices in the room, and two very attractive guys... One blonde, one brunette... Show up, and begin to fawn over you. One of them acts a little coldly, as though he\u2019s trying to keep his emotions in check. The other starts to worry about you openly, almost as if he\u2019s been in this position many times before. What is your relationship with these strange boys? Why are they dressed like strippers from Wonderland? One thing is certain... You can\u2019t let them know you\u2019ve lost your memories. Because banana.\\n\\n\r\nAmnesia was produced by a company called Brain\u2019s Base. I had not hear of this company until today, and if my Facebook poll results are any kind of evidence, you probably haven\u2019t either. That\u2019s a real shame, because they\u2019re actually kind of amazing. They\u2019ve put out a lot of highly visually impressive shows, such as Baccano, Penguindrum, and Durarara!! One of my favorite ways a company can achieve visual splendor is by carefully and skillfully allocating their budget so that not a single cent is wasted or wanted for. Amnesia is actually a perfect microcosm of their work, insofar as the fact that it has a lot of money to spend on big-budget special effects, intricately detailed and deliberately lit backgrounds, and an attention to detail that carries over to an outstanding sense of quality control.\\n\\n\r\nThe human characters don\u2019t move much, but the movements they make are just fluid enough so that no viewer should ever have to complain about them looking cheap. It also helps that the series had a really smart sense of visual direction behind it, and unlike a lot of shows, the 2D and 3D animation complement each other perfectly. One thing people may complain about is something Brain\u2019s Base had no real control over... The character designs. While the art style and the anatomical qualities of the human characters may be pleasing to the eye, this series completely jumps the shark in three areas... Hair, clothes, and eyes. I alluded in the plot synopses that each male character in our heroine\u2019s harem is designed with a different suit from a deck of cards in mind. There\u2019s a hearts boy, a diamonds boy, a clubs boy, a spades boy, and even a Joker boy. Oh and there\u2019s also a boy only she can see, who looks like the Homestuck version of Peter Pan, if you can believe it.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one good thing I can say about these character designs, it\u2019s that if you cosplayed one of them, you wouldn\u2019t be confused for any other show. Unless somebody really thought that Wonderland had a Chip\u2019n\u2019Dales club. Each boy is adorned with the symbol of their respective suit, as well as different styles of leather jackets, including a hooded variety, a turtleneck variety, a too-small variety, and a duster variety. Of course, because reverse harems do occasionally follow the rules a of regular harems, they\u2019re also color-coded, mainly through the artificial coloring in their male scene hair. They also never change clothes unless they\u2019re at work, meaning that they wear these weird get-ups in public, day after day, without fail. Yes, this is common in some anime, but not in slice-of-life anime, damn it!\\n\\n\r\nThe music is nice at first, but it can become wearisome really quickly. It\u2019s mostly piano, and as pretty as it might be at a glance, it becomes repetitive, much like your typical visual novel soundtrack... tunes are meant to be played for long periods of time in the background while the player reads through dialogue and occasionally makes a choice, and that style sadly doesn\u2019t translate well to animation. The opening, on the other hand, is outstanding. The song is called Zoetrope, and it\u2019s a ice listen regardless of whether you\u2019re watching the video or not, but combined with the on-pace video does a much better job of making the main character and the main plot of the show interesting than ANYTHING in the actual story does. It goes through the tired cliche of showcasing all of the Harem character profiles, but it does so really quickly, instead spending the majority of it\u2019s time showing the heroine lost and confused in a dark abyss full of phantom playing cards.\\n\\n\r\nThe English dub was done by Funimation, and I really want to try to be nice about this, because the cast was obviously trying their hardest with the material given to them. It\u2019s hard to like any of them, not because they performed badly, but because there wasn\u2019t really any room in the show to perform well. Add to that a cast who\u2019s biggest name is Christopher Ayres, and you have to wonder just how many of their biggest names must have looked at the script and refused outright to have anything to do with it(And if this IS the case, God bless Emily Neves and Jay Hickman for having the decency to at least take bit parts). I\u2019m not sure why they bothered dubbing this anime in the first place, since there\u2019s really nothing any American actor could add to the experience.\\n\\n\r\nMaggie Flecknoe is our main character, presumably because she\u2019s the only actor they had who\u2019s bland and easy enough to overlook that they knew a nameless character with no agency or personality wouldn\u2019t make her look any worse. Not surprisingly, she also played the hapless female lead in Diabolik Lovers(She\u2019s also further proof that Log Horizon could get a good performance out of literally anyone). Her role never demanded any big emotional commitment from her, and like a true paycheck-desiring trooper, she didn\u2019t bother trying to give it one. Houston Hayes and Chris Ayres actually got to put some emotion into their roles, even if that emotion began and ended with \u201cI\u2019m pissed off at you.\u201d Shannon Emmerick didn\u2019t do a bad job with the cutesie Ryuksie character Orion, but then again, playing young male voices is kind of her only viable career option, s let me ask once again, \u201cHow many A-list VAs turned this series down?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nConsidering Sentai has to be picky with which shows they dub and which ones they don\u2019t, and considering how they\u2019re able to take one look at a piece of shit like Detroit Metal City and say \u201cehhhh, maybe not this one,\u201d I\u2019m honestly surprised they put forth the money to put this series out in English... On Blu-Ray, no less! I mean, I\u2019m sorry, but this is one of those rare occasions when the type of story being told, and the kind of character tropes being portrayed, there really isn\u2019t any real American equivalent to the material. They probably should have released this one in Japanese only, and yeah, that\u2019s also how you should probably view it. One Luci Christian role... Just one... Could have justified it enough for a recommendation.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d like to begin the writing portion of this review by running down the wonderful cast of characters that are featured in this gem. Let\u2019s start with the main character, named... She actually doesn\u2019t have a name. When she wakes up with amnesia, she never asks anybody for any details about her life, which means that through the entire anime, we never learn her name, her family status, or even how old she is, which would be unforgivably creepy if a quick look at wikipedia didn\u2019t list her as an 18 year old college freshman. She\u2019s listed in the credits as \u2018heroine,\u2019which is a laugh, because \u2018hero\u2019 and \u2018heroine\u2019 are titles you\u2019d give to characters who are active, show positive qualities, and have some sort of agency in their lives, whereas Heroine-san seems to be the personification of the term \u201cJust go with the flow.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nMuch like Mayuri from Steins;Gate, the world is trying to kill her, but unlike Mayuri, there\u2019s actually an in-universe explanation for it(which I won\u2019t spoil.). She dies in each world she\u2019s in, mainly due to the fact that she likes to run out into the street without looking first, although the fact that she can\u2019t swim may also play a factor. Of course there are other possibilities, like Orion\u2019s suggestion that if she doesn\u2019t stay close to people at all times, she may forget how to breathe. A suggestion she takes seriously. Yes, a college student doesn\u2019t know that breathing is an involuntary action that even babies do. Orion also convinces her that it would be a bad idea to tell the people in her life that she has amnesia, because like I said earlier, Banana. The only conscious decision she EVER makes is picking a lock to get out of a cage, and the only reason she does that is so she can get back to her apartment and find proof that she loves someone in order to stop them from raping her. Because that\u2019s how rape works? She has literally no standards for dating other than \u201cmust be hot bishie,\u2019 and to prove it, let\u2019s see just how charming her princes are. And trust me, each one is worse than the last.\\n\\n\r\nHer boyfriend in the first timeline is Shin, represented by the Heart suite. That\u2019s actually kind of appropriate, because while none of these guys are \u2018best choice\u2019 material, I\u2019d consider him the \u2018least awful choice.\u2019 He\u2019s a year younger than the heroine, and he has a chip on his shoulder from society shaming him for the accidental sins of his father. He cares about her, and his main issue is with jealousy... Not a good trait to have, but a believably human one, and one that I actually would have liked to see fully worked through. Unfortunately, Heroine-san falls off a cliff and jumps to a new timeline, where she\u2019s dating Ikki, a much more boring character who\u2019s life has been tortured by what I\u2019m going to call the PG rated version of Dane Cook\u2019s curse from Good Luck Chuck. He wants her because she\u2019s immune to his charm, and the girls who ARE obsessed with him provide a constant source of antagonism for her throughout the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nNext up, very briefly, is Kent, and if there\u2019s an offensive stereotype for asexuality out there, he\u2019s it. I know lots of women fall for the stoic guy with glasses... Kyoya from Ouran, I feel your pain... But they tend to have actual personality traits, like pride, or condescension, or something. Kent doesn\u2019t have even the most basic of emotions, and every single coupley move he makes on Heroine-san can be drawn back to advice he got online or in a book. I actually AM asexual, and no, we\u2019re not like that. We have human emotions. We understand basic human interactions. Kent is not a realistic person, which makes it extremely hard to not only relate to him, but to figure out what Heroine-san saw in him as a potential lover in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Toma, one of the most disturbingly popular reverse harem options ever. Do you remember how in the wake of Chris Brown beating up Rihana, there were flurries of women online claiming it was okay, he could beat them too if he wanted to? That\u2019s Toma\u2019s fanbase in a nutshell, so let me just run down what this hopeless romantic did. There are going to be minor spoilers here. He realizes Heroine lost all her memories, so he lies to her and says their dating. This is already horrible, but we\u2019re not done. He drugs her without telling her, which she has no reaction to, even when Orion warns her about it. He then sticks her in a dog kennel... Yes, it\u2019s a cage, but it\u2019s also a dog kennel... and claims he\u2019s trying to protect her. Her only reaction to this is \u201cThis isn\u2019t you... you\u2019re not like this...\u201d Uh, yeah, sure, keep telling yourself that. And then, like I said, she breaks out and finds the diary on her previous self in this timeline, and it coincidentily says she loves him, which prevents him at the last second from raping her.\\n\\n\r\nThey make googly eyes at each other, and then in the very next shot, she\u2019s in the hospital with a broken leg, with no explanation offered as to how it happened, and even though I know she has a knack for getting run over, I\u2019m going to assume he broke it to keep her from running away again. Yeah, remember that romantic scene with the sledgehammer in Misery? Something like that. And then we meet the final boy, Ukyo, who\u2019s a literal murderous psychopath with a Jekyl and Hyde style split personality, and... Can we just stop now, and admit that all of these characters are awful? Can we just all agree that this is the most unlikeable cast of main characters since The Devil\u2019s Rejects? Like I said, Shin had potential, but honestly, he wouldn\u2019t look nearly as appealing if he didn;t have the rest of them to compare himself to. Nothing they do registers with Heroine, nothing ever alarms her, nothing ever convinces her to avoid or refute them, and Orion isn;t any better as he just spends the series dumping exposition and giving her terrible advice.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so if the characters are terrible, how\u2019s the plot? There is no fucking plot. Nothing that happens means anything in the grand scheme of things. As a matter of fact, you could easily skip the first four story arcs and go right to the fifth without losing anything important. The point of this series wasn\u2019t to slowly unravel an intriguing mystery, or gradually learn more about our main character through several shocking plot twists, it was to fit every single story path from the original game comfortably into the series so fans of each one could get their jollies off at some point. It\u2019s like the story structure of Clannad, except in that show, every arc had some sort of central purpose going forward. The only point each arc in this anime has is to make the love interest of the previous arc look more appealing by comparison.\\n\\n\r\nOr maybe the point is to make them more appealing? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t understand the appeal of dangerous or possessive lovers. Yeah, Yuno from Future Diary is hot, but I still wouldn\u2019t touch her with a sixty foot pole. Maybe I just don\u2019t understand the whole masochism thing, or maybe I just don\u2019t get the appeal of being controlled, because apparently these characters are considered legitimate sex symbols on Japan. Even the subject of caging, which the Japanese voice actor himself apparently found weird, can still cause half a room full of women to go crazy for him. I guess I can give a pass to this show when it comes to fans who know that what they\u2019re watching is an unhealthy escapist fantasy that would be unsalvageably horrifying in the real world, but because I don\u2019t like to over-estimate people that I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m going to have to assume there are impressionable young viewers out there... both male and female... who may catch a bad message about abusive relationships, and I can\u2019t forgive that.\\n\\n\r\nAmnesia is available from Sentai Filmworks on both DVD and Blu-ray. It was originally really expensive, but can normally be found for low prices at certain Rightstuf sales. There are about six different entries in it\u2019s visual novel franchise, and while I don\u2019t feel like listing them all down, a few of them are available as imports to Playstation Vita. The series can also be viewed on Crunchyroll.\\n\\n\r\nAmnesia is the perfect example of a show that just gets worse and worse as it continues on. I originally didn\u2019t think too poorly of it, as I\u2019d been pre-warned about some of it\u2019s early flaws, and the way it played to popular dating sim character tropes, so I was at least expecting to enjoy it on a so-bad-it\u2019s-good basis. What I actually got was a series that was so devoid of energy and passion that I found myself dozing off through most of the episodes. And yet, as boring as it was, it\u2019s a surprisingly dangerous series, in the same ballpark as Popotan, albeit with a different message and much more commendable animation. Amnesia could easily teach young girls that toxic behavior is forgivable in a man as long as he truly loves you, especially since the main character is specifically designed to be have no name or personality so that any viewer can imagine themselves in the role. I even found out very recently that fans of the original game hate it, and that\u2019s saying something. I give Amnesia a 1/10.",

            "content": "My first review and I feel compelled to do it for Amnesia. I feel like it's not getting enough credit. It really isn't bad! It wasn't just a girl trying to pick between a swarm of boys, it had a story to it. A good one! One that keeps you thinking. I know people tend to not like being confused when they watch a show, but I find it better then your usual predictable romance.  \r\nStory: 6 \r\nThe story could have been taken a lot further then it went. I don't think 12 episodes is enough for a strong storyline as well as characterdevelopment for all characters. But considering how short the series is, it did a fairly good job.It had a lot more going for it then your typical shojo anime. The story was fascinating and really kept you guessing throughout the whole thing. Though  at some points one could get a bit lost in what's happening. I really enjoyed how it wasn't just a romance and the concept of visiting all the different timelines/worlds/universes or whatever one could go through.  Though it's far from outstanding, It could have been much better developed, but it is good.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 \\n\r\nThe art was the best thing about the show. It was absolutely stunning. a bit colorful, but who doesn't love a colorful bishonen with gorgeous eyes? The character designs were fantastic, I even liked the little card suit theme they had going on. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5 \\n\r\nIt was okay I suppose. Nothing outstanding about the music. Typical shojo mood music to go along with the sparkly plot. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6 \\n\r\nConsidering this was based off of a dating game, which usually does have overused sterotypes of characters. (i.e= The cool tsundere, The pretty boy, The smart guy, and The childhood friend) The characters, for the most part, were pretty solid. They took stereotypes and sort of added a little sprinkle of uniqueness into them. (Take Toma for example) \\n\\n\r\nThough the male characters were deliciously bishonen, our poor heroine is sadly a very sorry excuse for a main character. In some ways it's very excusable, considering she has Amnesia and doesn't know who she is, therefor has no real personality to begin with. But some things I couldn't take. Such as her submissiveness, naivety and overly-trusting personality. Amnesia is no excuse for not having a backbone. I really wish they made her stronger of a gal instead of someone who is relying on the men around her and the kindness of some little fairy boy. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 \\n",

            "content": "If you like reverse harem shoujos, this is pretty much what you need to be watching. I'm one of those people, so I really liked it although not so much at the beginning.\r\nThe story episodes kind of drag on in a slow fashion in the start and doesn't really make sense for the first half of the show, you will probably start predicting and making assumptions (like I did). Character development isn't all that good, and I wished they described more on each guy and what they do usually, school clubs but I guess they could only fit in so much about each character (becausethere's 5 guys) in the show. You only learn a bit about each boy, but you learn the most about Ukyou. Near the ending of the show though, it becomes more clear what's going on and the story line. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't like how the main character was so slow. I understand that shoujo girls are usually soft and quiet and then guys like her, but this was just bad. She took an irregular amount of time to respond in a slow, quiet whisper. If she had been a little more outgoing, the story would most likely have been more fast-paced and you'd get to know the guys better instead of waiting for the Heroine to respond. Although this may be because she has amnesia and she's just being uncertain to what's around her, when people that you think you know are telling you things, don't go easily listening to whatever they say. She's very gullible and naive, and doesn't seem to have a sense of danger until it's right in front of her (literally). \\n\\n\r\nIt's nice to see how the guys react around her, what they tell her and what they do for her. It nicely portrayed how much they liked her, especially with Toma and Ukyou. The art is really nice (I don't understand why all the guys sleep with their day clothes on) and their eyes are so cool.\\n\\n\r\nThe end of the show was a nice ending, with everything resolved and it ending in a cliffhanger for you to choose what happened. It's wasn't so sad as to cry, though (and I would know because I cry in everything I read, watch or hear about that pulls at my heart strings). I would love to have seen the answer, but then again, I wouldn't know my answer either if I had to choose.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thought this was a decent show. It had a reverse harem, cliched romance, attractive guys and most importantly, how much work a guy went through because he liked you so much.",

I admit, I thought the plot was fairly good, so i decided to watch it; but about the third episode in, I felt it was getting draggy, and had to pacing in the story. The main heroine is so confusing and emotionless, I was ABOUT TO GO CRAZY. She barely has her own thoughts, and most of her words are \"oh.\" or \"I see\". The plot was good, but it didn't really go anywhere, so the times when she goes to a different world, it makes you go \"WTF JUST HAPPENED?\" And the characters were fairlyweak, with no build-up behind them (weak to the point where you don't even know their names). Any good things about this anime was that the art was done well, so i can't complain about that. In all, i give it a 5/10. I don't really recommend this anime to people who want to watch it, but if you want to, go ahead, I just don't think you're really missing out on anything. Ok, bye.\\n\r\n~ Thanks for reading ^_^",

Considering it was adopted from an otome game we know it won't have much depth to it and the plot isn't such a bad idea. \r\nYet as i followed the story i found myself feeling just as confused as the main character herself. And what really urked me the most about this anime was infact Heroine. The name hardly suits her when she did nothing about what was going on. At one point shes falls off a boat into the lake andorion tells her to swim and what does she do? The answer certainly isnt try to swim back up. Throughout the story she hardly speaks and sits back and becomes useless as all these events and guys are thrown into her life. Not once did she speak up. (Plus your life is suddenly a reverse harem where bishies left and right are claiming to be your boyfriend this is not the time to run away). As episodes contiously aired i found myself yelling at Heroine to just do something. \\n\\n\r\nOf course when it came to the end it was left open, and almost left something more to be desired. As an otome game it does well but as an anime it left me terribly frustrated. That's why i could only rate this as fair as i still kept interest in it and it wasn't bad to the point where i wanted to abandon it at all (i suppose because i wanted to figure out where the hell this show was actually going).\\n\\n\r\nFrom an otome game point of view it makes sense why heroine is so dull, you're the one who puts life into her, chooses the path, and you become part of the game; but put into an anime Amnesia doesn't work out well and leaves you with the question of \"what the hell just happened?\"",

For the girls out there, you can probably put yourself in one place where the Heroine was at. As for me, Toma's world was me. And I cried. A lot. You can feel how the characters feel, and this is the most interesting storyline ever. Everyone wants to travel to a parallel universe and see how people around them would be. You get your opportunity here actually! It felt like a dating game every single episode and each episode taught me something. Although I'm curiouswho'd she'd be with... But that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Developement (10): It's definitely a ten for a reason. You see how different the people around the Heroine are as she changes worlds. Especially Toma and Kento. Toma was a cheerful brother of Shin, but in his side of the story, he's a prince who traps Heroine into the cage to protect his princess. As for Kento, he went from a ****, to a timid boyfriend. Toma x Heroine was a great love story though. Until Ukyo ruined it.\\n\\n\r\nStory (10): No fillers! Yay! I love how she never dies though. She was thrown down a building, fell down a cliff, and drowned. But she woke up like it was nothing. MIND BLOWN. XD! But still. I would never expect any other smart idea.\\n\\n\r\nOverall was an eight. The ending wasn't expected. I thought it would be like 'amnesia, then no amnesia', but I was shocked. It wasn't. To those Amnesia haters, don't hate. Cause I bet if you watch this, you'd stay up until four in the morning desperately trying to finish this anime. Which was me. XD! But still... Give it a shot. But if you want action and fighting, there isn't much here!!",

So here is my opinion on the anime.\r\nPlot: Heroine (no name in the anime) loses memory, and trying to find answers as to what happened. But during the story she seems more focused on the romance than on the actual goal. I like the idea of where the story was heading, the mystery did get my attention. But I couldn't follow this story until episode 10 when the story got back on track. \r\nArt & soundtrack: I gotta admit I love them both, the opening and ending was beautiful and the art was fantastic, the colors as wellthe scenes we're clearly defined. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The main protagonist lack personality. Sorry fans but she rarely smiles, laugh show any emotion of any kind. Yes, she lost her memory doesn't mean she lost her personality. \\n\r\nFor the males in this anime I absolutely adore them, from their dress style to their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall I feel this anime is good I like the art, sound, and the boys. If this anime kept to what it say it was gonna do all through the series I wouldn't mind it so much. I don't dislike this anime I just don\"t like the heroine and the way she is perceived.",

Well, here's why...\r\n~~ you'll only get to understand the anime if you watch til the end, so,just when you start understanding the anime, the succeeding episodes destroys the plot viewers are trying to build...maybe (accdg to my younger brother) because it was based on a game, however, there are anime adaptation from games that ended up really great.\r\n The Heroine, just seem so frail and weak, and that she's so confused and shocked.. and every guy is after her... puh-leease!!! ( I am not being mean,but my left brow is arced up), yeah, of course, she lost her memory, and she gets to live the same day with a different story, but, couldn't she be more tough?\\n\\n\r\nBUT!! I should say the art is great, beautiful anime characters, and I love the opening song of the anime, thumbs up for that. I just hope the story was good\\n",

            "content": "Amnesia is an anime that is a hit or miss with some people; you either love it, or you don't. While I can't say I'm in either of those two categories, I do have a strong opinion on this anime, an I haven't decided of they are good or bad yet. \r\nStory: 5.78/10\r\nThe story is very basic, seeing as it is based off an Otome game. The Heroin in Amnesia is reliving the same day, but in an alternate universes', each one having a different boy as her lover. The story is fairly clich\u00e9, but this particular anime has strong points that make up forthe lack of story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.45/10\\n\r\nThe art is beautifully done, very well for an anime of this genre. Generally romance anime haven't been very well animated in the industry, and this proves otherwise. The characters are interesting and very well designed, the irises are also very lovely to the eyes. Overall it is extremely well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.79/10\\n\r\nThe sound also is another aspect of this anime do so well; the voice acting and the opening and ending are very nice. The OP is very well done, and remains one of my favorites. The voice acting is nice, but the downside it doesn't have a Dubbed version yet (hopefully!).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5.89/10\\n\r\nThe characters were lacking originality, especially our Heroin (who actually doesn't have a name in the anime!). The other characters (or lovers) are based off of suits in a deck of cards (Joker, Heart, Diamond, Ace, and Spade). Without spoiling too much, what I can say is that some are very.......possessive of our Heroin. She is not very strong willed, but Otome-Anime games aren't know for the strong female lead, are they?\\n\\n\r\nI personally recommend this anime, but be warned for it to be a hit or miss. This can be highly enjoyable, or you can drop it like its hot. Enjoy!!   \\n",

I've watched many romance anime before and this really got me hooked up. \r\nStory: 8/10 \r\nThe first 3 episode's we're quite confusing too me, but i realised that the genre of the anime is \" Romance & Mystery\". I totally loved it, The heroine jumping to other boy's lives is quite cool. I've watched plenty of Romance anime where the girls are always screaming at the guy or it took place on a school and i got tired of it! The mind-blowing twist's in the anime is super cool and the onlything that i hate is the ending, it looks like they rushed it and would be better if they made an OVA of it or if they showed the heroine's life after the whole messy problem. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI love the Art! It's just like the art in Uta no Prince-sama. But it would be great if they always change the character's clothes (but i guess, that's a bit normal for anime show) again, the art and how the characters look is simply perfection and i love it! \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe music's and sounds really suit's the anime! I love the opening song and especially the ending song! especially when the episode ends and you just got a mindblown! :] the best! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI don't like nor hate the heroine of Amnesia, she's too quiet and only say one word or one sentence every time she speaks something. The 4 boys are good. i love their attitudes especially Kent since he's the only \"unique\" one. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story is a bit twisty, i still enjoyed it and hoping for an anime like Amnesia, since i dont like the \"too obvious\" romance anime..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10! \\n\\n\r\nI read the top review's and im a bit dissapointed to his/her review, but everyone who watched amnesia has different opinions. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------jenny",

It shows great potential in the beginning, given some of the characters background, I think they could have elaborated more on them, (specially the fairy world) and give the story something more solid. \r\nThere are several reasons why I kinda dislike the story, one of the major one is that the main character seem to be out of it all the time, yes, at some point it was necessary and rather funny, but in general she seem to lack any motivation to figure out what was happening to her. \r\nAnother reasonI believe the story was not as good was because, in all the worlds, she worked and lived in the same place, it would have given the story more juice if she had have a different lifestyle in all of the worlds and not just the boyfriends. \\n\\n\r\nThe good thing about this story is that it keeps you interested long enough to figure out what is going to happen to the main character, also it keeps you wondering who was she before all this started happening, was she that different, which makes the audience imagine another version of the main character.",

It bored me to tears and then some! Give me back my time wasted! \r\nStory: it's got an interesting concept but for some reason it seemed so incomplete. There were heaps of plot holes and it was boring to be honest. If you ask me there was not enough romantic tension, a key part of otome game inspired anime. The relationship between the characters was also a little off, it just didn't feel right. It seemedto be a bit negative or depressing... \\n\\n\r\nArt: I understand that this was a fan service move but some of the outfits were ridiculous! The Heroine looked silly.... Guys seemed overdressed and over the top. \\n\\n\r\nSound: the biggest letdown! Touma being an exception, I missed the usual Ikemen voice actors. I'm a fan of Eureka but what's with the alien voice? Ukyo and his voice actor were poorly cast... Somehow the Image I had was different based on his design. Perhaps the seiyuu tried too hard to distinguish between the two personalities.\\n\r\nSaving grace - op and credit soundtracks are awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: the heroine was annoying. I liked Orion only him. The most interesting character was probably Touma even he was mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: meh\\n\\n\r\nOverall: it sucked.... Writers wtf were you thinking!

And when she finally is getting used to her life, she awakes again at another place and she has to start all over again. Besides this, she has every time when she wakes up another boyfriend. It was really confusing why she just woke up everytime and it was 1 August again, but I gotreally addicted to this anime, because I wanted to know why it was that way. And I liked the relationships between the Heroine and the boys. And besides all this, I thought the ending was really good!\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThis is probably the only anime I can give a 10 for the art, I thought it was really great. The clothes, the eyes, everything, it was done great.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nIt's already half a year ago since I watched this anime, but what I remember of the sound is this: I believe also this was great, I liked the sound because it fitted well with the moments and I also really liked the opening song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nI'm not very good at describing persons but I will give it a shot:\\n\r\nThe Heroine: What is really weird about her is that she doesn't have a name, it is NEVER mensioned in the anime, but I didn't really realise that while I was watching the episodes, altough it is pretty weird. Her personallity, well, she doesn't do much and she let things just happen around her, but what would you do if you were somewhere, and the only one you could kind of trust was a spirit with the name Orion who was travelling with you? I think I would be really confused and kind of scared, so I do understand her.\\n\\n\r\nWell, all the guys, I will give a short description, at least I'm trying:\\n\r\nShin: He's kind, in his own way, but he isn't very patient and you could say he is a sort of bad boy, but he isn't really bad.\\n\r\nIkki: He's the popular guy who is a lot of time surrounded by his 'fangirl group', so I think you should kind of know what sort of person he is.\\n\r\nKent: The smart guy who doesn't know much of romance, but, something you will see in the anime, he does his best to be better for the heroine, and that's somehow funny in it's own way.\\n\r\nToma: He's a bit obsessed with the heroine and is really afraid of losing her, but he loves her also in his own way, but maybe a bit too much.\\n\r\nUkyo: In the beginning you might say: Who is Ukyo? Well, you'll see later, because it will be a big spoiler if I tell much about him I will say three things about him: He's very mysterious, but also loving and caring, you will see it in the anime :).\\n\\n\r\nBesides from these boys you have one other important character:\\n\r\nOrion: He's is kind of her guide trough what's happening to her and he tries to help her as much as he can.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I liked Kent, Toma and Ukyo the most but everybody has his own opinion :)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much. I was really confused and I wanted to know the ending really bad, so I just watched all the episode in one night, so I couldn't get much sleep that night but I was definitely worth it! I also think that the romance part in this anime was quite good :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI think girls will like this anime more than boys, and I think personally that this was a really good anime! (And I'm a girl). So I was really dissapointed when I saw all the bad reviews about this. Before just not watching this anime because of the bad reviews, you have to give it a shot yourself. I was certainly NOT dissapointed, I thought it was great and I liked almost everything of it. Also the aspect of using the figures that you see on cards: (I mean: spades, diamonds, hearts and clover) was a pretty good idea. You might not totally understand the ending of the anime. (Well, that's what I saw in some comments) But if you understand, you'll see that it's actually really good.\\n\\n\r\nFor now I will say this: don't skip this anime just because of the bad reviews, just watch it and than you should see for yourself wether you like it or not.\\n\\n\\n",

In a way, this anime reminded me of Dramatical Murder, an anime that I personally love (except the bullsh!t that happened in episode 3); they both have nice colourful visuals, protagonists that suffer from symptoms of amnesia, animalistic sidekicks & a handful of characters that have their own personal relationships with the protagonists. This anime is a nice representation of what an amnesiac person may experience when trying to gain back their memories. I also like how she is transported into different dimensions & allows the memories to eventually makea complex but nice connection. I know that this anime was based off a dating game & that probably explains the reasons why the protagonist is dating someone new, but I've seen a lot of people moo about this anime & say that the story's a pile of incomprehensible bollocks. I can sort of understand why some people would say that, but overall it takes a bit of time. However, the thing that kind if ticked me off was that nobody told the main character what her actual name was. If a person is wondering who exactly they are, the first thing that someone should tell them is their name. I don't know if the other characters were either like: \"F*ck it. She'll know eventually.\" or they all put on their retard hats & were like: \"Duh! She knows what here name is. Her amnesia's not that bad.\" Despite the few flaws, I did enjoy this anime as it does provide a realistic view on the topic of amnesia. I also love the main theme; if it weren't for that song, I wouldn't have known about this anime :)",

I still enjoyed it though! If you love reverse harem animes, make sure this one makes it on your list! \r\nThe anime style is pretty, the OP is great, and the boys are hawt.\r\nThe story is fun, slightly creepy at times, but like most people who watch reverse harem animes, I wasn't watching it for the story ;P\r\nMy biggest complaint about this anime (as with most reverse harem animes) isthat the female lead was a complete air-head. It irks me when a character seems to say or do the wrong thing (or do nothing) every time there's a desperate situation. However, I guess one could rationalize it saying \"Would you be able to think clearly if you were surrounded by so many gorgeous men?\" No...probably not.",

            "content": "So this is my first review, I am terribly sorry if I make any mistakes. I have always been a big fan of otome games and therefore of otome game anime. So I have watched this anime in May last year and at first I was very confused by what was going on. Nobody really explains what is going on in the beginning, you just jump right in. Although Orion, the Heroine's little helper does explain some things. Already at the end of episode 1 I started to enjoy myself a lot. The art is beautiful and the music just stunning. It really emphasizes themood of everything. The Heroine is, like most Otome Game/Anime characters a little quiet and doesn't really have a strong personality, although that might be understandable due to her memory loss. In my opinion this is alright because in the first place an otome anime would be to find yourself in the Heroine's place and if she had a certain personality that wouldn't be possible for everyone, also it is described that she has a different personality in every world. In December, when I was already long done watching the anime I played the game and after I was done with it I watched the anime once more. Everything just made more sense and I got answers to questions the anime didn't provide.\\n\\n\r\nMy conclusion would be, that the anime is very enjoyable if you like otome and can deal with weak female characters or not knowing what is going on at first. For me the anime makes more sense as an addition for the fans of the game but it is enjoyable even if you didn't play it.",

            "content": "I don't think this series gets enough credit personally. \r\nThe story is very interesting and in my opinion not very hard to follow at all. It goes from story to story in a pretty fluid way. The art on this show is probably it's most stunning aspect. The way the characters are designed especially the hair and eyes are pretty and they do a more unique sort of thing where they blend colors. One character's hair is yellow but fades into orange at the tips and the cloths are interesting and unique as well. A lot of work went into the character designs and itpayed off because the fact that it looked so nice art wise was why I started watching other then the plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound has good quality and so is the soundtrack. The voice acting is also really good quality and done well, you can tell what emotions they're trying to convey and they don't fall short with the sound quality at all most of the time. I also really loved the characters in the show as well. My only complaint was that alot of them would always follow that \"I'm going to be cold to you first and nice to you later\" pattern and I wish they had all been a bit different in that regard but other then that I enjoyed most of the main characters with the exception of of one them. Even the side characters were nice for me to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall yeah this series is good but it may have been a bit rushed because they tried to fit an entire otome game into 12 episodes, I guess they were trying to advertise the game. If it had been longer though, it would have been better. In the game each characters route takes place over a month and you have more of a chance to get to know them and 4 to 5 endings for each, one of them even has 9 endings! So that's why shoving everything into 12 episodes wouldn't work out and I can see why people would be confused and not get it. For the time it was given though, I think it did a pretty good job. I recommend this anime because it has an interesting and unique plot for an otome game anime and I personally like most of the characters and find them interesting. I would also recommend the game it's based off as well!",

It begun with an introduction to what happened to our fellow heroine, who was not named in the series. Interesting as to how the entire series followed up without the main character's name being mentioned AT ALL. Often the character was called upon by a single 'hey' or 'neh, kimi'.\r\n~Art~ Was well drawn and fairly anticipating. Character's clothing however stays the same throughout the entire series.\r\nOverall a confusing anime at first but gradually, allyour questions will be answered.",

Even so, it wasn't an original idea, but it was ok.\r\nArt(9): The best part of the anime. I absolutely loved the clothes, the hair, the eyes.. everything. It was different, in a very good way. \r\nSound(7): It was good. I personally liked the OP theme and there was one soundtrack I noticed at one point and really liked. The ending theme was ok too. The boys' voices are sooo hot, but the voice of the maincharacter may be annoying for some.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(7): I give it a 6 for the boys. As this anime is an adaption from a game, I expected the heroine to have no personality but.. GOD! I found myself yelling at the screen at some points \"SAY SOMETHING, PLEASE!\" She barely talks and most of time says \"Yes\", \"No\", \"I'm sorry\" or \"Thank you\". I understand that she doesn't have any memories but that's not an excuse.\\n\r\nThe boys are almost perfect. They are very different, but no one has the perfect life. Each has his own problems and story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(4): This anime kept me on the edge of my seat for four hours. And not it a good way. I couldn't stop because the fact that she didn't have any memories bothered me a lot. I can only tell that you have this whole mystery for most part of the anime, not even the ending is clear. I expected a lot from the ending, but then again, it's adapted from an otome game so I shouldn't have expected so much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall(6): If you want good-looking guys, cute but no-personality heroine and lots of mystery, Amnesia is for you. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I gave the story a 5 because it was confusing, but at the same time, I understood why it was called Amnesia. I was unable to get past episode 5 because I was thoroughly confused. The only reason why I got that far was because people kept telling me that it was worth it and a great watch. I lie. Another reason why I got this far was because of the art. It was very detailed and I especially liked the detail of theeyes. Seeing as how this is based off of an otome game, the transition was smooth and it truly felt like a video game. My enjoyment was a 5 because it was hard to follow the story and it got so confusing to the point of which I had to stop watching. Don't get me wrong, the first 3 episodes were great until the story became more definite and real. My overall score is a 6 (based on the episodes I have seen so far). Because many people have said that it is a great series once it is finished, someday I may come back to it.",

This anime in particular was very moving and had many things going for it; however, there were things within the anime that I found appealing and not so appealing. \r\nStory- The story line for the show was very well thought of, and it was a great idea; however, the execution was not handled well, in my opinion. This was an anime that I did have to watch again in order to understand. However, it was very well thought out, greatly enjoyed the plot!\r\nArt- Oh my goodness! The art in this anime was amazing!! Everything wasanimated very smoothly, and each character had their own touch that made them their own! However, I will say that for the main character, she was a little plain, but I think that is just because of how I see main characters. Overall, the art style was magical and wonderful!!\\n\\n\r\nSound- Each of the characters had great voice acting! I will comment that I have only watched this anime in Japanese, and I have yet to hear the English adaptation; however, I don't believe that should be a game changer! Also, the opening and ending for the show were very appealing to the mind! Wonderfully done!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-This show was well thought out; however, like I previously said in the \"Art\", the main character was very plain, and not just in her art style, but also as a character. Because of the situation, it is clear to see why; however, I think they could have given her more dynamic shaping in her development. However, all the supporting characters were so well thought out!! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Other than the comments made above, the anime is actually very well developed! I greatly enjoyed this anime; however, because of the plot, I cannot give this category a higher rating...\\n\\n\r\nOverall- I give this anime a 7/10! It had both appealing and non-appealing parts to the anime, but it was still decent!",

I watched it in Japanese, which I'm not a native speaker of, so I can't really comment on the voice acting.\r\nUnfortunately, the plot and character development is bad. The story isn't particularly interesting, and the characters are incredibly boring and generic at best. A special mention goes to themain character who could easily be replaced by a stick of celery. She is incredibly passive, barely speaking when spoken to, and has no semblance of a personality.\\n\\n\r\nI usually find reverse harems enjoyable, if not particularly good, but I can't think of a reason to encourage anyone to watch this one.",

She was so passive and she doesn't really have a \"character\". Sure the guys were hot and whatnot, but if you're looking for something more than just the pretty faces then Amnesia isn't really right for you. \r\nNow what I did was watch the first two episode (watching one episode might have sufficed) then I watched the last two episodes (11 & 12). Sure, I missed some parts but really, I understood immediately what was happening. Or did I just think I instantly knew what washappening. It was a bit confusing though. Nonetheless, I had a clue what was going on. \\n\\n\r\nI actually liked the ending (don't kill me). Call be shallow, but it did make sense. When I said the ending, I meant the part up until the revelation between Ukyo and the female protagonist. Without the other disturbances and if only the story focused on one lead guy, I think it's not that bad. Yes, I know it's inevitable since it was based from an otome game. Damn the scene after the flashbacks and when she stepped inside the door. I wasn't particularly fond of that scene. Despite of the bittersweet ending, the tragic ending I wish it stayed at that. I was like, DESPITE EVERYTHING CHOOSE UKYO DAMN IT YOU CAUSED HIM ENOUGH PAIN NOW PAY IT BACK. But then again, I haven't watched anything in between and I don't know what's the deal with the other guys.\\n\\n\r\nDamn it, there wasn't an Ukyo road in Amnesia Later (as far as I know). I think I liked Ukyo because I didn't really watch the whole thing. However, I couldn't help but skip everything because it was a bit dragging and because the heroine didn't really stood out despite of being the main character. I don't get it why she can't stand for herself. I mean, if you've got amnesia sure you can be taken advantage of, but she does have the choice of not trusting them (although I think in episode 2 or 3 it was revealed that she has amnesia, but she was so damn submissive. If she didn't liked the kiss or if she was shocked she should have pushed him away).\\n\r\nAnother is that they know--knew-- her, the fact that she's acting strange, shouldn't that alert them? It was like nothing changed before and after she got amnesia. It's like she was always spacing out, quiet and whatnot from the start. To give it some slack, I didn't really watch episodes 4 to 10. So yeah.\\n\\n\r\nI would watch the other episodes, but not now, maybe in other times that I don't have things to do or when I'm bored or whenever. I dunno.",

The characters each have their own unique style of dressing, using a combination of a signature color accompanied by checkerboard. The sound is so bad that I don't even remember it at all, that is the only reason it has a bad score. Another thing about the story that is aggravating is each time the main character ends up in another world she runs into a man who obviously knows something about what is happening to her but she never onceasks him. So it was more infuriating than anything.",

            "content": "A mystery anime that involves traveling through parallel worlds, in each one where the main character is dating a new cute boy, but as soon as everything seems happy, BAM she dies and is transported to another world. Not many ways you can mess this one up, eh? Will, Amnesia finds a few.\r\nAmnesia is an anime adopted from an otome dating sim of the same name animated by the studio Brain Base and directed by Ohashi Yoshimitsu, his most notable other works being Sacred Seven and Bakumatsu Kikansetsu Irohanihoheto. It tells a tale of our nameless heroine (because, you know, all of the guys shedates just prefer to call her you and stuff like that) who one day wakes up with amnesia. Her only guide is a fairy called Orion, who says that to regain her memories she needs to hang out with the people who she used ot hang out with to regain her memories. Quickly however, she begins hopping between dimensions somehow (whenever she dies she goes to a new one) and in each of those new worlds she is dating a different boy. Thus she needs to hide her memory lost from these boys so she won't be sent to the hospital (you see, if she never talks to anyone, then she will die or something along the lines of that) while trying to understand exactly what her relationship is with the boys so she can act like she knows them, and of course try to figure out exactly what is happening to her. \\n\\n\r\nSo the plot. It is rather good in the mystery area. I mean, while I did guess what was happening, I couldn't figure out how it was happening. And the stories with each one of the boys are rather good enough. Well, okay, some of the events are a little extreme, but more on that later. \\n\\n\r\nDue to the fact this is an arc-based show, I'll go over each one of them. The first one is over Shin, and the heroine has a memory of him saying \u201ckilled a man\u201d. However, that is resolved rather nicely and due to the fact this is the first arc, it's more or less just the heroine trying to get used to her situation. Shin is a decent enough heroine. Sure he's your typical dark boy with a mysterious past, but he's not annoying at all. Then comes Ikki's arc, which is a little worse due to how idiotic the heroine acts (I quickly solved the mystery that bothered the heroine in this arc almost instantly). Ikki is a rather good protagonist though. He's a ladies man and has dated several girls besides the heroine in the previous months before the show started, but he's not rude or annoying at all. Then comes Kento, my favorite boy by far. Blunt, awkard in romantic relationships, smart and actually figures out part of what is happening, so of course his arc is the only one to last 1 episode, while the rest before him got two. And the half of episode he sacrificed goes to the two other heroes, who are both my least favorites. Touma, oh my god, just Touma. Well, going into why I disliked him so much would be spoilers, but just the things he does. While it does make a little sense at first, the extremes he goes to, and how the heroine acts like a total doormat too and forgives him quickly at the end. And the boy of the last arc, it's a spoiler to go into it that much, but it was... Meh. I mean, the ending of this show is awful. Just an dull info-dump in a setting that makes no sense whatsoever. They even leave it in the air who the heroine ends up with. \\n\r\nSpeaking of the heroine, she is terrible. She has no personality at all and acts like a complete idiot. I swear over half of what comes out of her mouth is \u201cUm... Er... Ah...\u201d and stuff along the lines of that. Just some of the decisions she makes and how she is unable to comprehend her situation at all. She's easily the worst part of the show, even with the bad ending and Touma's arc. Other notable characters include the manager of the cafe where the heroine works at, who changes personality every arc for some reason, and the fairy who helps the heroine out, who is eternally cheerful and happy.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was good, some of the soundtracks help add to the suspenseful mood. The opening theme is very good, with the ending theme being more forgettable. The voice acting was also good enough, minus for the above-mentioned heroine, though that has more to do with script than anything. \\n\r\nThe animation... Well, okay, so they don't move much, but all of the designs are very detailed and look pretty, and this being an anime where the point is the cute boys, that is sort of needed. Another thing to note is how everyone wears these extremely ridiculous outfits that are card-themed. Shin wears clothes to the theme of hearts, Ikki wears clothes with the theme of spades, and so on. But they all still look really stupid in those decked-out clothes that no one wears in real life. \\n\\n\r\nAmnesia is far from a bad show. The mystery is decent, most of the characters are good, the music is a plus, and the designs look pretty. However, it is pulled down by a terrible lead character, one of the arcs is terrible, and the ending isn't very good. If you're a fan of bishonen or mystery anime, then check this out. If not, then watch it if you don't know what else to watch. It's a decent show, despite the fact it has several flaws.",

The first episodes leaves you disoriented but as the story develops, you get the feeling of wanting to know as to why the heroine is in the situation she's in. For some users, the story build-up was rushed to the end, because the answer to the mystery was explained on the concluding episodes, but for me it was just the right timing.If you want to 'savor' this anime, you'd want to try to see it as the heroine sees it. Since it's based on an otome game, it's goal is to let the viewer take the heroine's role.\\n\r\nThe first episodes really are important for building the right amount of curiosity 'till the end, as it makes you think and make you wanna solve the 'riddle' behind what's really happening. And as for the last episodes, my heart felt what it wanted to convey, I mean I cried myself out when Ukyo was trying to say goodbye and..\\n\\n\r\nOh well, you just have to watch this anime if you want to know what I mean :)\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this for those who want to watch a Mystery/Reverse Harem/Romance anime.",

            "content": "Story: I have heard that this anime is supposed to be shit because it's one of those reverse harems based off a otome game. To be honest, I would expect this anime to annoy the living shit out of me because I don't want to watch the game; I wanna play it. Unfortunately, since I am from the United States, this is the best that I got. I'm just gonna straight up say that it could've been a whole lot worse. As the story went along, especially the last arc, it definitely got more interesting. It gave us more reason about why the story ishappening the way it is. Is it the best? Probably not. Is it shitty? Not as much as haters made it out to be. You don't have to agree with me, but because I don't wanna spoil too much, I would give this a 7/10 just to be nice.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style was definitely an interesting choice since they were basing this off the game it came from. The colors were what struck me the most. In such a dull world, each character had a color (or colors) to represent themselves (well, mostly whatever shape was on a playing card). It wasn't as out of place as I expected to be, and because this is a fantasy game, it does seem to fit with the setting strangely enough. Honestly, I love Orion's designs the best. He's just so cute. However, there are sometimes creepy imagery that I feel as if doesn't need to exist, but it's not a huge complaint. With that, I'll rate it 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening is good. I mean it's on my favorite's list, but it's pretty low on it. It's not bad, but it's something I would skip sometimes. I just skip the ending all together because it never appealed to me at all. Then, there's the inside music. It's over the top for no reason except the fourth arc. I don't understand why. Compared to other anime, it's a bit subpar, which is why it's 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I think the best way I can explain character is rating every single one in simple phrases.\\n\r\nHeroine: She's not as bad as I thought she would be. She just lost her memory, so what do you expect her to do when she's going through this jacked up mess? There are times when she can be fucking incompetent, but if anything, she's trying her best to get by.\\n\r\nOrion: I just wished that he was more relevant to this story, but unfortunately, he's not. That doesn't make him bad, but it makes him less important than what the anime made him to be in the posters, which shouldn't be true. He is the reason why the Heroine is going through this journey in the first place, but he disappears? Why?\\n\r\nShin: My favorite out of the boys. He just seems to show the most emotion for our Heroine, and they seemed the perfect fit. I wanted to see more of them together, but you don't.\\n\r\nKent: His arc is the most boring. This guy is supposed to be the smart one, and boy, is that his only trope.\\n\r\nIkki: His is the second boring but the side story is the most dramatic. Perhaps too overly dramatic.\\n\r\nToma: This character pissed me off to the umpteenth degree. This guy was completely over the top in his arc for no reason at all. I can't like this guy at all. I just can't.\\n\r\nUkyo: This guy was very interesting. He appears a lot, but I can't spoil too much without ruining the anime.\\n\r\nSide characters: They are decent, but they're not really the main focus, so they are the least interesting  of the bunch.\\n\r\nThe overall rating for this section would be a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Like I said, this anime wasn't as bad as people made it out to be. However, am I obsessed with this show? Probably not. I kinda used this as background noise to whenever I was doing homework. My favorite arc was Shin's because he was my favorite boy out of the group, so I would say, this part is going to be rated 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's easy to say that I was trying to be nice with this anime. I really tried by best to be fair, but the score is the score after all. That's why I'm giving this a rounded up 7/10. If you are not a fan of reverse harems or anything based off of otome games, this is definitely not for you...or at least it's not the best I've seen. By the way, THE DUB IS ACTUALLY NOT THAT BAD! It makes it more tolerable than anything else.",

Overall, this is a great story and the detail is impeccable.  The artwork is in my top 3.. no 2 animes that have role-model-worthy artwork and dedication,with Kuroshitsuji being my first.  If you are new to anime, I do NOT recommend watching this as a primary, because the story (well, the beginning) is rather confusing, although that makes for an excitingconversation starter. Along with how the personalities of the characters have potential, and very well could be the traits of an actual person.  Which is GREAT if you like to read/write fanfictions.  \\n\r\n         But, overall, if you are looking for a new anime to watch in a short period of time (because this anime is unfortunately only 13 episodes long) I would definitely recommend this.  Especially to people who are looking for an action/romance/mystery (if that's even an actual genre, haha)   kind of entertainment. \\n\\n\\n\r\n      Thank you guys if you actually read all of this.\\n",

            "content": "For starters, let's just say that I enjoyed this otome-based anime FAR better than  I did Diabolik Lovers; though that's not saying much.\r\nAh, Amnesia. What can I say about you? You're not utterly forgettable, but you aren't amazing either. You're just.... average. Maybe that's the worst outcome. This show doesn't have much rewatch value sadly, because unlike a game, you can't go back and redo things or see events from a different point of view.\r\nThe story itself does have some clever aspects, but that's mostly due to the game, I feel. I didn't have much trouble following the story until the very end. Iexpect the game explains the plot much better than this show does, but that's  the problem. One would have to go back and play the game to get the full story and experience, I feel. And a movie or show should never be like that. They should be able to fully stand on their own without the help of source material.\\n\\n\r\nNow, as for characters, well, the male leads are all fine, but the female lead? She's a complete doormat. That's the problem when you make anime out of otome games. The main lead ends up having no personality because the main lead is usually the player taking control and making decisions. Oh, sure characters say that she has a personality, but as we all know in the world of the media: show, don't tell.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't find myself hating any characters, though, so that's a plus. Some of them really have sympathetic moments, and of course, being one who has played a couple of these dating sims, I began to expect that not all of the  love interests would be what they seem. It was quite entertaining to figure out who the psycho crazy boyfriend was. But of course, the over-the-top scenarios in otome games amuse me, so some might not find a certain character amusing like I did.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the major sin of this anime is not that it's dark, disturbing, or even badly presented. It's just bland; average, and sometimes that's worse than being downright awful.",

            "content": "STORY  3/10\r\n------------------\r\nI believe that there was a lot of potential in the plot, but it needed serious elaboration.  I was left very dissatisfied with the ending which, really, didn't \"end\" anything.  It was much too sudden with an extremely poor essence of finality.  \r\nA girl who is loved by five different guys gets amnesia and has to decide who she's in love with.  That's basically the extent of the plot.\r\nART   9/10\r\n---------------\r\nWhen I first saw a review for this anime the first thing I noticed was the art.  I am very particular when it comes to the qualityand styles of the art in both anime and manga.  I have on multiple occasions either dropped or written off anime even before watching simply because I can not stand the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is exceptional!  I loved the fresh approach they gave to the eyes and facial expressions.  One of the reasons I didn't drop this anime was because the characters were just so unbelievably beautiful!  The only reason I didn't give it a perfect score was due to the lack of detail in the background.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND  8/10\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nThe theme for this series was an instant favourite of mine!  I've listened to it almost non-stop since first starting this anime.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this show could really have stepped up it's background music.  A good instrumental can really help emphasize the intensity or tenderness of a scene, which is something that I didn't find this anime took advantage of.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER  6/10\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nOnce again there was a lot of potential here.  Overall the characters could easily be seen as bland (especially the heroine) or single-minded.  But given the concept of the anime I found them well portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I enjoyed about this anime was that it wasn't limited to one person's ideals of the perfect boyfriend.  There were traits to appeal to everyone (similar to Ouran High School Host Club).\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT   5/10\\n\r\n------------------------\\n\r\nIt was, all things considered, a good anime.  I personally have ranked it #1 in my current favourites.  But I can see how this one isn't for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nAnother one of it's redeeming qualities was that the swearing was kept to a minimal.  As far as I can remember there were only a few appearances of the words a** and d*** throughout the entire series.  It's hard to find a good anime without frequent or moderate language.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL   6/10\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\r\nI would recommend it to people who enjoy shojo, reverse-harem and, how shall I put it, \"multiple choice\"?\\n\\n\r\nSome other anime that I suggest you check out if you like this one are:\\n\\n\r\n~ Ouran High School Host Club\\n\r\n~ Fruits Basket\\n\r\n~ Kamisama Hajimemashita",

(like boyfriends)\r\nStory- 7\r\n~ Mind-fucking Story *claps claps* It is really confusing at first but it gets clearer as the series progresses, I have to admit that this series is kindadull and boring. to be honest, there are still few questions left in my mind about this series that i don't know how am i supposed to know, it is like there's something missing. I'm not satisfied with the explanation in the last episode, but the story is really awesome . i like it, if they only made it more exciting i would probably gonna love it.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 7\\n\r\none of the reasons, i watched this series is because their art is really flawless and awesome. its so colorful *sparkles* yeah i love it so much\\n\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\r\n i've got nothing to say about their ED/OP. i like them especially zoetrope\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 8\\n\\n\r\n      First of all .. their Outfits are all really weird that you're gonna think they have super powers ,i think its better if they change clothes everyday and wear casual clothes since they're on modern time.\\n\r\n     These 5 ikemen Bishounens *cough*\\n\r\nTo be honest, i only watch reverse-harem animes, for these kind of stuffs. (haha)they have their own  personalities and you can tell which is who and who, because they've got also different hair styles and outfit. i can tell that they're characters were based from cards (heart,diamond,flower,spade) they're all really nice and adorable ( i dont mind having having one of them as my boyfriend tehee)\\n\r\n     about the heroine. i am really kind of disappointed how plain she is , like why those five guys love him that much? i mean she's pretty boring (sorry) and she always goes \"uh , hai, oh \"  ( = _ = ) her expressions are.. really....life .. less\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment - 6\\n\r\n those kissing scenes & romantic scenes XD, i did really enjoyed watching those parts but i undeniably gonna say the the rest are pretty boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8\\n\r\n i find the story really interesting, Its a mystery shoujo anime that you're gonna like depends on how you sees this series. well for me, i like it ~ that's all ^^\\n",

            "content": "At first I was skeptical about this anime because it's about a girl who loses her memory and she needs to interact with various hot guys to get them back...okay? But as I progress more into the series, I was hook. It's actually really interesting because of the mystery involving the Heroine's memory loss.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe plot was really confusing for a couple of episodes but as I keep on watching it actually made decent sense. Like I said, the mystery surrounding the Heroine is exciting and makes me want to keep on watching. However, it does get predictable later on which slightly degrades the excitingpart. But it is still enjoyable. Also since this is an otome game, the transition of the Heroine's interaction with each guy is GENIUS!!! I give it ten gold stars. It's like choosing a route but in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is remarkably beautiful, especially the male characters' eyes. They seem to draw me in Also the characters' clothing designs isn't what you would see on everyday common wear, which makes them unique and important to the story. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI really like the opening theme of this anime. It fits the mysterious mood of this plot perfectly. The beginning of the song gave me the feeling of emptiness and the questions, \"who am I and where am I?\" which fits the Heroine's situation pretty well since she did lose her memories. Then during the middle of the song, it suddenly transition to rock music which gave me the feeling of 'never giving up' which also fits the Heroine's personality of not giving up searching for her lost memories. The ending theme isn't nearly as good as the opening, but it's still good. I like the singer's soft/quiet tone in the beginning of the song. It gave me the mysterious feeling of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThe Heroine's character is quite disappointing. She's too obeying. Like if you tell her to sit in that corner of the room until dawn, then she will do it. No questions ask. People can easily take advantage of her if she doesn't learn how to stand up for herself. Also speaking of not standing up for herself, she mostly relies on her trusty fairy's opinions about various situations rather than her own. It gave me the feeling that she can't do anything by herself. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the hot guys, their personalities are quite bland and predictable. You can practically tell what they'll do next, except for a certain guy...I thought that he was this type of character, but actually he suddenly turns 180 and he's actually this type of character. It's very unexpected and so that's why I gave the character section a 6/10 rather than a 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoy the series. The mystery and the unexpected guy made me want to watch this series more and more. I was even hoping for a season two since the otome game of this anime have sequels. Please let it happen someday because I need to see more of that guy's route.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n",

She woke up one morning remembering not even her life, her relationships, her very name\u2014all gone.\r\nIsn't it thrilling to know what happened to her? \"What was that all about?\" first popped out in my head. All she had was her cellphone with contacts she can't remember who and Orion, a young boy that only she can see. The first episode would really leave you hanging. \"Why doesn't the girl remember anything?\" \"Can Orion really be trusted?\"\r\nThis anime doesn't focus much on the romance, butmore on the mysteries in the surroundings of the heroine and her memory loss.\\n\r\n\"Amnesia\" is a 12 Episode series (23 minutes per episode). Full of mystery and will make you watch for more.\\n\\n\r\nThe heroine was kinda stiff. She can't even voice out what's on her mind. Also, her voice might be annoying to some. She barely talks at all. And when she does, it's usually single words or sound effects that express her doubt and confusion. Since she can't remember anything-- and she's on a journey to find out who she is, the anime doesn't really give any solid qualities of her.\\n\\n\r\nThe characteristics of the heroes were much of a cliche.\\n\r\nThere's this bad guy, the extremely-popular guy, the overly smart guy, the social and outgoing guy, and the mysterious guy.\\n\r\nTheir pasts weren't highlighted. But I think that's what the author wants. Their \"mysteries\" is what drives the watchers, what drove me, to watch the next episodes and to finish it ,or so I thought. But until the very end of the anime, I was still puzzled of who they really are and what's their connection with the heroine. Nothing much was stable.\\n\\n\r\n\"Amnesia\" is an anime that'll filled you with mysteries and will keep you watching until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nBut I still hated it how all things were explained in the last 2 episodes of the anime. It came all at ones. So you have to keep still and watch the 10 episodes and find out everything at the last 2. I kind of feel that the ending was sort of rushed-- very rushed (it got me a little bit disappointed) , though I was still expecting for more, all in all.. the anime was great. As for the romance, since Amnesia is a Reverse Harem, the heroine had her chances to be with the guys.\\n\\n\r\nI really salute the artist. The characters were perfectly drawn, very good-looking indeed! Aside from the plot, I was really hooked of how the characters look like. The details were really astonishing! Their clothes are very detailed, their bodies are well proportioned, and their eyes were really interesting. I really love it-- beautiful and smooth. Even the surroundings were great.\\n\\n\r\nThere wasn't much of a comedy. Most of the scenes/ episodes were dead serious. But still, like I've said before, the mysteries will keep you hanging-- seriously.\\n\\n\r\nYou'll probably like \"Amnesia\" if:\\n\r\n1. You like Reverse Harem 2. You like attractive males 3. You like Romantic scenes (there were kissing scenes)\\n\r\n\"Amnesia\". An anime that'll keep you thinking. Its mysteries will keep you going.",

Then when I actually watched it...I had to stop in the middle, this WHOLE anime is basically the same episode over, and over. Later I started to watch it again, IDK why but I did,  Finally somth'n different happened and then there's the weird multi-personalty person \"Ukyo\" that actually made the anime interesting him and Touma.Second, I was expecting more of a Romance and not some harem. I watch a variety of anime and mystery is one that I would RARELY watch. Sooo...Yeahh! It felt like I only watched this anime because the characters and art was good. To me anime/manga art is all about the eyes and the face...of course everything else too, but the face is what intrigues me the most. \\n\r\n   Anyway, my main point is that this anime didn't get interesting till like the 7th episode. Plus I didn't really get the ending...\\n",

Five guys fight for winning her heart, and she is girlfriend to all of them for a day, but who does she choose...\r\nI really like the start, where you'll get freakin confused and you mind is fucked. But even though you'll be confused, you'll already start understanding in the end of first episode. But I have to say, you'll keep on being a little confused for the rest of the time. \r\nThe story is absolutely amazing, and very well written. I give the story10\\n\r\nThe art also fantastic, and surprising me in every episode, 10\\n\r\nThe characters are great to, but almost too different, 8.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8\\n\r\nAmazing story and art, I'm seriously amazed. But I have to say I hate the ending, it's will only be a good ending for there will me a season 2, but who knows.",

The storytelling does a good job keeping you wondering whats going on, keeping in line with the main character's own confusion.\r\nIt's a decent romance, but don't expect too much from it.",

The opening theme of the anime is definitely one my favourite , while the artwork is one of a kind.\r\nCharacters :\r\nWhile  they are really well drawn , the characters lack of a special / distinct characteristic , sth  that will differentiate them from other characters and willmake them remarkable. As for the heroine , she is definitely the typical heroine in reverse harem animes , which is really passive , lacks guts , doesn't stand for herself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall , from all the reverse harem anime series I have watched so far this one is my favourite , and I firmly recommend it to anyone who is into that kind of anime.",
