            "content": "So, Kuroshitsuji is an anime that is labelled \u201cshounen\u201d but I don\u2019t really know why - it\u2019s filled with bishounens, pretty clothes and the fancy Victorian age backdrop with massive shounen ai and shota undertones. Oh, and the obvious gay shinigami who keeps trying to kiss the butler. \r\nThe story starts off with an eerie atmosphere, showing a 10 year old child who exchanges his soul for a demon butler to help exact his revenge against the people who killed his parents and humiliated him. Two-three years later they are still together; Ciel Phantomhive the 12 (later 13) year old Earl also the head ofhis house and company and Sebastian Michaelis, the demon butler who could do anything and together working for the Queen to solve mysteries and at the same time learning about Ciel\u2019s past. \\n\\n\r\nIt would have been a great story. If not for the amount of filler episodes that had been injected in due to the lack of material that had come out from the manga and the confusion in later episodes that still left me with many, many questions. \\n\\n\r\nThe first and second episodes were indeed spectacular. Instantly there is a dark and mysterious aura and it is well maintained throughout the entire series (except for the idiotic moments with the less than lovable extra staff at the Phantomhive household). Even up to episode 6 it was still good. However, after that it just started to get a little tiring with all the missions they have to carry out. Boring in fact. The second half of the series was entirely all filler; filler that wasn\u2019t even interesting and to put it plainly \u2013 all over the place. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the anime does not follow the manga series exactly but the first half of the series does to an extent. The second half was written exclusively for the anime. Now this is where it goes horribly wrong. Most of the second half\u2019s story made absolutely NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. Take Sebastian\u2019s sudden disappearance for example. For someone who has made an unbreakable contract and who has already done about two years work for Ciel it was a unrealistic that he would leave Ciel. Moreover it was uncharacteristic of him. His personality wouldn\u2019t allow him to do such an act, even if it were to benefit Ciel in the end.  Plot twists came from nowhere, justifications and character motivations did not add up and I would end up sitting there by the end of the episode wondering what on earth has just happened.  Poor writing plagued the last three-quarters of the series, which is a real shame, considering how much I enjoyed the first six episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nWhen I first heard Sebastian\u2019s and Ciel\u2019s names I laughed. \u2018Sebastian\u2019 as the butler\u2019s name, that was so clich\u00e9 and Ciel \u2018Phantomhive\u2019 - now that didn\u2019t sound conspicuous at all did it? Well it certainly did humour me with these obvious names, but the characters themselves aren\u2019t ones that you can laugh at. Sebastian is seriously one badass butler, the anti hero of our story; he can do anything and I mean ANYTHING. After he SEDUCES A NUN to get information he certainly got my respect - the thought of him using such tactics was almost unthinkable (considering all the \"sexual tension\" between him and his master). And Ciel\u2026 well he is bratty. And he certainly does talk a lot of bull when it comes to why he is doing all this and such. What I liked about him though was how the producers practically used him as a doll to model fashion wear of the 19th century. \\n\\n\r\nBut these factors do not save them from being two dimensional characters. Sebastian can be thought as the anime parallel of Edward Cullen. Essentially a \u2018perfect\u2019 being with zero flaws, devilishly good looks (no pun intended) and abilities to do the impossible he contains no realism in him, more like a fantasy or ideal of \u2018the perfect man\u2019. But unlike the Twilight character mentioned there is an almost witty aspect to the butler, as each episode displays his tendency to be mischievous. In all honesty, though he is not much of a character for BEING the main character, he was still quite the fun person to watch as a viewer. Sadly, I cannot say the same for Ciel. As far as I\u2019m concern, he was there for the fanservice \u2013 from cross-dressing to wearing scantily clad clothes for a teenage English boy \u2013 mass producing shota fans as we speak. His reason for working for the Queen is neither explained nor in line with his prideful personality and his burning desire for revenge towards the people who \u2018humiliated\u2019 him is not emphasized or profound enough to take him seriously that he is truly a bitter, angry boy. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were very well done, both musically and animated-wise. Most anime usually does this thing where in the middle of the series they change the opening song and have a whole new animation to it. With Kuroshitsuji they keep the same song but switch around the verses used but have a whole new animation to it. The first ED uses an American song \"I'm Alive\" by Becca which would catch some off guard. The rock/pop song contrasts greatly with all the other themes uses but is a song that can be easily sung along to. It also is one of the most amusing endings ever with the animation that employs a chibi-styled art showing the day to day activities of Sebastian as a butler. The second ED song is a lot more melancholic to fit the serious second half of the story.  The background music is smoothly done and go fittingly well with the scene at hand. As an anime set in the high class 1800s, the production company rightfully uses dark gospel choruses to jazzy themes. \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation was very beautiful and fluid. Grand manors and clothing were all intricately designed and even in the few action scenes A-1 Pictures still had animation kept up \u2013 never letting choppy animation to ruin the flow. Everything is very gothic usually with night-settings, religion being brought in and of course, the clothes. Although Ciel did look very adorable in his attire, I felt like the clothes he was wearing were almost asking for him to be molested, which just made the paedophilia and gay overtones a lot more strong. \\n\\n\r\nThe most enjoyable part of this anime was the London/Victorian age setting. I was actually quite impressed with how well they displayed and used London and its history, like how they made Bethnal Green the base where all the drug dealers were from or the fact that there used to be fairs on the Thames during the winter when the water turned to ice. The producers did use the London card to the max - playing with different versions of \u201cLondon Bridge\u201d, using the Jack the Ripper character and displaying the fashion of the time. And of course since it\u2019s set in England there is some engrish, but the best one is Sebastian\u2019s \u201cYes, My Lord\u201d - makes me smile every time. The setting practically made this anime; I mean if you replaced the setting to a modern time, different place this anime would have immediately failed. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say it put the \u2018shit\u2019 in \u2018Kuroshitsuji\u2019 neither would I say this is a spectacular watch. This series was just \u2018okay\u2019 to me, it wasn\u2019t particularly special and it\u2019s quite tedious. I have had many unanswered questions formed in my mind and quite a few qualms about it. For those of you who actually read manga I suggest doing so first or instead of watching this since it just contains the main story and does not sell itself short with fan-pandering nonsense.  \\n\\n\r\nWill I be watching the second series? Well, yes for numerous reasons. I liked the manga enough to want to see it animated. I want to see if my questions will finally be answered. And most of all I want to find out WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED after the end of the last episode.",

            "content": "Holy flippin' A!!! Where to even begin with this anime?! There is so much here that I look for in an anime; I even added it to my favorites list before I was even done watching. It's got beautiful and THICK plot, hidden meanings, a GORGEOUS musical score, wonderful and zany characters, and enough emotional hitting power to make me keep a tissue box handy for those sad and happy tears.  This would be my first review to be an absolute 10 in score if there weren't just a few unanswered questions and assumed understanding after everything was said and done.  Even withthose there, though, this anime is one of the best things I've seen in a while, even better than Hikaru no Go which had be so wrapped up spring break. I'm sad to see it end 'cause I want more of this world, but, on the other hand, I'm glad it's got a definitive ending and isn't really leaving us cliff-hanging.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this show is something else. There's just so much depth, and it's so cerebral. I'll definitely have to do some re-watching to get all the little nuances and plot points down. I wouldn't recommend this show if you're just looking for some simple anime that would kill an afternoon. This is a thinking anime that touches on a ton of dark and deep issues. You'll also need to be paying close attention to all the plot twists! These little suckers come out of NOWHERE and twist the story into a completely different direction that one would expect. I was left gasping like fish more than once here.  For me, that's one of the best aspects of this story is those little plot twists. I never know what I'm going to see when watching something like this. Now that I've mentioned the good, let's talk about why I couldn't give this aspect a perfect 10. After watching the ending, I was left with some unanswered questions regarding some of the details here. While these details didn't sour the complete story for me (hence the 9), they might sour it for someone else. One detail that they didn't address did leave me a bit peeved, but my mind made a connection with another story aspect that I could guess was the answer. If everything had been addressed here, this would have been a DEFINITE perfect 10.\\n\\n\r\nART - 10\\n\\n\r\nA simple word here. BEAUTIFUL!!!! The animation flows so gorgeously in this anime. From the fight scenes to humorous antics to zany parties to heart-wrenching death scenes, absolutely everything here is flows so smoothly and sweetly. An aspect I noticed a lot in this anime was lighting. I don't see that a lot in anime and found it very appropriate for this title. If the characters were experiencing a dark and horrific scene, shadows and reds played big parts. If they were experiencing light-hearted birthday parties or servant antics, colors were bright, vibrant, and day-filled. Besides just the lighting, the art conveyed the atmosphere so much. It almost seemed to reflect character emotions and fates/destinies as well as set the mood for the anime. You will not be disappointed here! Just a slight warning, though, this anime doesn't shirk from blood. Not that it's gratuitous, every scene with it almost requires it and the blood adds to the atmosphere. But do be warned; I wouldn't let kids watch this.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the crowning glory in my opinion. Every single piece of music adds to the atmosphere of this anime and leaves a person breathless. It's so haunting...... It's full of fast consistent beats for the fighting, chants and drones for the dark, plot-filled moments, sad female-filled melodies for the gut-wrenchingly sad parts, and a soft operatic finish for the final anime finale. There was use throughout the anime of a really fast beat chanting/droning thing used towards some combat and many plot-revealing scenes that I found particularly innovative and unusual. It added something really unique to an already beautiful track of music. The opening and ending themes fit the anime to a tee; the 2nd ending, Lacrimosa by Kalafina, especially fits the ominous ending the anime is barreling towards when this ending comes in. It's haunting, lyrical, and so emotion-filled. Just beautiful!! Besides the glorious musical score, this anime exhibits very good character voices. I especially loved Sebastian's dark and low voice. I could imagine my demon butler having that voice. *shiver* I can't think of any misplaced vocals at all. Everyone was distinct and complete unto themselves.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 9\\n\\n\r\nThere were so many hidden depths to most of these characters that absolutely no one seems two-dimensional. Everyone is fleshed out to some degree with emotional back stories and plot twists. Oh the plot twists!! There were a lot where it came to character development. I only wish that there had been equal attention to all characters. For some of them, the viewers were left wishing fervently for more. I personally wished the back stories of the servants at Phantomhive were fleshed out more. We are given some back hints in a few episodes and one episode almost completely devoted to the four of them, but not really a lot and I was curious! Oh well. The gradual building of Ciel's character and his relationship with Sebastian is more than enough to make up for it. There were some characters who I thought I had pegged when something radical happens and their intents and motivations turn in a completely different direction. Again, oh those plot twists!! Gotta love 'em!!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this title, unanswered questions and all. My mind can find connections between points where there may be no connection and so I can answer those questions in my own little mind. It was a beautiful and haunting ride that took me on an emotional rollercoaster and through a thorough mind-wringing. There was so much content here, from plot to wacky humor. I loved every bit of it. And the music!! Ack!! I'm going to be haunting ebay and the net in general looking for this OST ASAP!!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 10\\n\\n\r\nI think I pretty much summed it up in the enjoyment section. Everything just came together beautifully and created an anime that has made it to my favorites and re-watchable list. I absolutely adore it and wish there was more!!\\n",

            "content": "As of late, Kuroshitsuji is essentially the poster-boy for thinly-veiled fangirl bait. Kuroshitsuji (or Black Butler, whatever floats your boat) has tons of yaoi tropes, and has the word bishie plastered all over it, so you may think that being somebody who does not like these things, that I hate it because of that. So let's make this clear now: No. That has nothing to do with it. There are plenty of legitimate reasons not to like Kuroshitsuji besides that, so before you reach for the Not Helpful button, please think for a second: are you doing that because my review is badly written, orjust because you don't agree with my score? So, at the very least, just read the rest of the review first, OK?\\n\\n\r\nWith that sadly necessary disclaimer out of the way, let's discuss Kuroshitsuji. Kuroshitsuji is the story of a boy named Ciel Phantomhive, and his butler, Sebastian Michaelis. Ciel is the head of a toy company, and is also in the employment of the Queen, who enlists him to deal with various mysteries. Why this is the case isn't really explained, but nonetheless, most of the episodes play out as a Sherlock Holmes style detective series with him solving various supernatural mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Ciel is no ordinary boy... he has a contract with his butler for his soul. As you probably already knew, Sebastian is a demon of sorts. He is nigh invulnerable to everything, has amazing skill in pretty much every field, and is basically perfect in every way.\\n\\n\r\nThis, however, is the first problem with the series... Sebastian is a massive Gary Stu. He's simply too perfect. Not once do you feel for him as a character. He is completely overpowered, and is essentially an end all, fix all solution to more or less every single problem the series can throw at any of its characters.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the rest of the cast isn't much better. Ciel Phantomhive is probably the most likeable character in the show, being something of a snarky, deadpan character with a chip on his shoulder the size of Africa. But he has his idiosyncrasies as well... most of which simply come down to him being a complete jerk to everyone. Ciel is generally single-minded, only caring about whatever mission the Queen has given him, or getting revenge on those who ruined his life. The reaper, Grell Sutcliffe, had potential to be a loveable psychopath in the vein of Ladd Russo or any given Hellsing villain, but they eschew the chainsaw wielding, slasher smile route laid out in front of them in favour of making him incredibly, incredibly gay, as though they were trying to make a psychotic badass Leeron. But unlike the aforementioned Gurren Lagann character, they don't manage to make him nearly entertaining or tongue-in-cheek enough... to be perfectly honest, Grell is just plain offensive.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with Kuroshitsuji is that it can't seem to decide what it wants to be. For half the series, it goes down the aforementioned Sherlock Holmes route, painting a great depiction of 1888 London, rolling through themes like Jack The Ripper and Scotland Yard, but for the other half it tries to blend a Tim Burton-esque supernatural demon theme to the mix, and the tone of the series becomes very inconsistent as a result. Both styles are well-executed, but they conflict with each other. If they had been more consistent, Kuroshitsuji would have been better as a result. The character designs also mirror this quite heavily; While we often get a good, 1800s design like Sebastian, we also get overblown, colourful and vibrant designs like those of Grell or the Undertaker that creates a very poor contrast.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, there's something that can occasionally be very jarring, and that would be the anachronisms. Despite the show being set in 1888, you will frequently see things that are very out of place in this time period, like advanced modern handguns, sophisticated chainsaws, and film. While all of these things did exist in some form at this point, none of them do in the form they are shown in. And even more jarring is that most of these are applied to the Reapers, ancient beings that would not realistically incorporate these sorts of things into their supernatural array of weapons.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on that note, one of the things that annoys me most about Kuroshitsuji is that the demon lore is left completely unexplained, as though they were some sort of afterthought. The reapers hate demons, but why? It's never given any real mention. There are also Angels, only one of which we ever see, whose purpose and role in the demon lore is never even touched upon, let alone their motives. I think Kuroshitsuji would have actually been better if they had completely left out the angel/demon/reaper aspects of the show and solely focused on the detective angle instead.\\n\\n\r\nThe only aspect wherein Kuroshitsuji really shines is the production job. The animation is fluid, and the art style is thoroughly polished, using a blend of dark, rich tones. The 1800s environment is one of the strong points of the series, which makes it all the more of a shame that they so often opt for the Burton-shtick instead. The soundtrack is also very strong, featuring a variety of music fitted to the period, most notably the smooth jazz.\\n\\n\r\nNow, before this reads like an invitation for all the yaoi fangirls to break down my door, let me just clarify this by saying that Kuroshitsuji is not bad. What it is is average. Ordinary. Run of the mill. The only exceptional thing about it being the insane level of fan-pandering it stoops to.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is still one serious problem with Kuroshitsuji not accounted for... the ending. The last few episodes are an evermounting pile of contrived nonsense. Things happen, but no explanation as for why or how is ever really given. No character's motivations ever make sense. Plot twists come from absolutely nowhere with no foreshadowing or real explanation. It rivals Soul Eater in terms of ridiculous bullshit endings, but at least Soul Eater didn't leave us on an incredibly dodgy cliffhanger that leads to a second season of pure filler.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: It had potential, but it ignored it so it could pander to fans.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: 9/10\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 3/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Hellsing, Pandora Hearts.",

            "content": "When it comes down to programmes that I enjoy but have a hard time defending, few can come anywhere close to the position that Kuroshitsuji has on my list. There really is a lot that I enjoy about the programme, but there's also a good deal of stuff about it that just gets under my skin. Considering the fact that this is a show that receives no shortage of praise and criticism, I feel that someone should try and give a semi-impartial review of the series and explain why they like it in the first place. With that said, let's get on with it.\r\nThe biggestreason as to why I enjoy Kuroshitsuji is the fact that it's a supernatural mystery drama. Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a supernatural programme that isn't action-oriented or comedy-centric? I've also got a soft spot for mystery drama and I also love the time period that the story takes place in. I've always had a thing for history and the rampant hypocrisy that went on during the Victorian period never ceases to capture my fancy. Furthermore, it's actually quite capable of keeping me hooked when it's giving me some involving plot. Of course, you can't really tell that it's a supernatural mystery drama that does all this stuff at first glance.\\n\\n\r\nThe most glaring problem that Kuroshitsuji has by far is the fact that A-1 Pictures does not know how to employ levity properly, which is most prevalent in the first 15 episodes. Furthermore, it opts for the worst kind of levity possible: chibi-style visual gags like the kind that Ultimate Spider-Man and Teen Titans use. Of course, I'd say that it's closer to Ultimate Spider-Man, given that all the levity ends up making it difficult to take the story seriously in the first place. Some people like to attribute this to the source material, but the manga itself is quite tame when referring to its usage of levity, but A-1 Pictures in their infinite wisdom decided to ruin a good thing. I understand that Kuroshitsuji is a shonen series by the end of it all, but is dark humour too sophisticated for a shonen audience? Come on...\\n\\n\r\nWhile we're on the subject, the second biggest problem that Kuroshitsuji has is the yaoi/shota subtext. Even though Yana Toboso  has written several yaoi mangas prior to writing Kuroshitsuji and that fact does reflect itself to a certain degree in the manga, any sort of yaoi/shota elements present in the source material were always intended to be used in a comedic context and weren't meant to be taken seriously in the slightest. Yes, you also have some official artwork of Ciel, Sebastian, et al but that shit don't contribute to the story so I ignore it! Unfortunately, A-1 Pictures in their infinite wisdom saw that there were a lot of Kuro fans who were into that shit and decided to dial up the yaoi/shota subtext between Ciel and Sebastian to an uncomfortably disturbing degree (it got to a point where I genuinely contemplated dropping the show). \\n\\n\r\nContrary to popular belief, Kuroshitsuji has a sizeable portion of its fanbase that *ISN'T* into slash in the slightest. I am a heterosexual male who absolutely despises paedophilia but I also happen to be an avid fan of the manga. Whilst the yaoi/shota moments that are present in the manga end up making me face-palm, they're short enough to the point where I can just look past them and pretend that it never happened. That's not the case at all when it comes down to the adaptation, since it felt like A-1 Pictures was playing this shit straight rather than for laughs. If I were to take a shot for every time there was a *serious* moment between Ciel and Sebastian which felt like A-1 Pictures was catering to the SebaCiel shippers, I'd probably succumb to cirrhosis. Okay, that's hyperbole but it's still a major problem that remains throughout the run of the programme.\\n\\n\r\nNow, another problem that Kuroshitsuji has when it comes down to the execution is the fact that it... gets... BORING. Seriously, this is supposed to be a supernatural mystery drama about a 13-year-old boy exacting revenge against those who've wronged him whilst losing everything precious to him in the process, right? Well, the first four episodes don't really paint this show to be like such. Instead, they just make this programme feel more like a slice-of-life comedy taking place in Victorian England. Okay, Episode 2 - \"His Butler, Strongest\" is kind of an exception but the point still stands. These episodes aren't bad by any means, but they certainly did get tedious for me. I just come into this show expecting serious plot, and I end up getting flawed storytelling. Well, it does get better but with a caveat attached to it.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike other popular shonen mangas such as One Piece which are published on a weekly basis, Kuroshitsuji is a monthly publication. As such, there was a limited amount of material to work with for the adaptation. Instead of giving this show a 1-cour run like it probably should've had from the get-go, A-1 Pictures decided to just fork the adaptation off from the source material after Episode 15 and then end on a completely different note. With that said, it should be noted that A-1 Pictures wasn't exactly the most faithful to the source material until that point and that there were many alterations present in what they did adapt.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, the final nine episodes were where the show actually took itself seriously whilst dropping most of the shenanigans. Furthermore, the ideas and whatnot that they actually brought up were fairly interesting to say the least. Also, I have to give A-1 Pictures props for at least having the decency to end the show before it got too unnecessarily convoluted. I don't know about you, but I'd much rather have a show that has a solid conclusion rather than a show that spends week after week in a filler arc until it can resume adapting chapters. On the subject of the ending, it certainly wasn't a grand finale but at least I can safely say that it ended... you know, until Kuroshitsuji II came into the picture and shit all over that (among other things).\\n\\n\r\nOf course, if you think these episodes don't make any sense or suffer from some rather noticeable writing problems, I don't blame you. The biggest problem that these episodes have is the fact that they try to accomplish far too much in the time that it was given (in other words, they're pretty damn rushed). I mean, I wouldn't mind it if A-1 Pictures at least extended the runtime of this anime-original second half to 15-18 episodes so that things could run at a coherent pace, but I guess it's too late to change that now. Hindsight's a bitch, ain't it? Sure, the damage was done by the time that this show started taking itself seriously but hey! At least it got its shit together!\\n\\n\r\nFrom a characterisation standpoint, Kuroshitsuji is rather flawed. Whilst the manga has been publishing for roughly eight years and has 100+ chapters as of 25/12/14, the anime came out in 2008 when there were only 24-25 chapters available to adapt at that point in time. As such, Ciel and Sebastian (among others) remain the same throughout the bulk of the programme's run. This is quite unfortunate, as I quite like Ciel as a character and the manga does bring up some rather interesting questions about  him. Here, he's more or less a generic broody protagonist who needs to stop trying so hard to be like Bruce Wayne but with an eye patch.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my numerous complaints with Ciel's characterisation, I have almost no complaints about our butler to the core, Sebas-chan. Simply put, I absolutely adore Sebastian and I'll admit to having fangirled over him more than once (seriously though, who hasn't?!). I can't bring myself to hate him since he's got a charm similar to Alucard from Hellsing (in the sense that they're both badass servant characters). A lot of people like to give Sebas-chan crap since he's damn near infallible, but you know what? I don't really care. He's a DAEMON butler. He's not bound to the same rules that govern humanity, and it's not like he's without personality either. I just can't get enough of his quips and his snark. Plus, there's always something hypnotising about watching a butler killing goons with silverware whilst complaining that dinner will be late if he doesn't hurry up. Really, my only complaint is the fact that he remains static throughout the run of the programme but then again... he's kinda like that in the manga too.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the side characters like the other Phantomhive servants, Lizzie, Madame Red, Lau, Ran-Mao, and the like... they don't really get a lot of screen time outside of being comedic relief. Well, some characters like Madame Red and Lau end up getting their roles expanded as the series progresses but the fact that they were comedic relief for the bulk of their appearances kinda made it hard to take them seriously once their time to shine in the sun came. It really is a shame that A-1 Pictures didn't allow for more time to pass before adapting Kuroshitsuji because characters like Mey-Rin, Finni, Bard, Tanaka, and Lizzie actually ended up becoming favourites of mine later on in the manga's run. Well... I guess that doesn't stop Mey-Rin and Finni from being so adorable that it hurts, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you get right down to it, A-1 Pictures might not be the best when it comes down to telling a story or giving us some good characters. But there's one area that they never cease to impress me with, and that's with their visual department. As much as I despise some of their OTHER works (*cough* Sword Art Online *cough*), there's no denying that each time A-1 Pictures works on a show, the visuals will be much better than what they previously worked on. That's seriously saying something, because the visuals here in the first season of Black Butler (which came out in 2008 no less) are absolutely gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really love about the art direction is the large amount of detail put into the backgrounds along with the colour palette. Unfortunately, the art direction and the animation don't really come into full bloom until Episode 16-onward when the show begins to take itself seriously. Everything before then is still really awesome stuff to look at, but the art/animation really shine whenever this show is taking itself seriously and is trying to feed us some involving plot. That really doesn't happen all that often in the first 15 episodes. With that said, the art/animation also shines whenever it drops the super serious, high-detailed stuff and goes into the less-detailed, comedy sketch stuff in a vein similar to Teen Titans. Whilst I'm not particularly fond of the comedic relief used in this show, at least I can say that the visual gags are well-animated and pretty to look at.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation on its own, well it's solid stuff. A good deal of the animation is limited to stills and talking heads but worry not for this is a drama show with some action thrown into the mix! The action sequences in this show are roughly similar to that of Wolf's Rain and Fullmetal Alchemist (2003): a lot of stuff happening in the foreground, not that much going on in the background. In fact, the high point of the action sequences are mostly going to be Sebastian stopping bullets before they leave the pistol along with Sebastian throwing silverware at random goons in the most epic ways possible. Of course, that's only fitting since Sebas-chan is one hell of a butler.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to note about the art/animation are the OP/EDs. You know how half-way through the season, the OP/ED change for no apparent reason in some shows, with new animation and a new song? Well the OP's animation changes at Episode 16, but they just use the second half of the OP song. Now, this isn't the first time I've seen an anime use the second half of a song for the OP (Trinity Blood did something similar), but this is the first time I've seen an anime use new animation for the second half of the song. It's the little things like this that make me smile. The 1st ED is shows a regular day in the life of Sebastian in chibi form while the 2nd ED is mostly stills of Ciel and Sebastian set over a more sombre tune. I'm more fond of the 1st ED, but the 2nd ED actually fits the show becoming more serious toward the end of its run and the song doesn't conflict horribly with any dramatic moments! I give props for that.\\n\\n\r\nArt/animation ain't the only thing that Kuroshitsuji has down because the OST for Black Butler across both seasons and Book of Circus is some downright amazing stuff. It fits in amazingly well with the time period that this show takes place in, with most of the BGM being stuff like slow jazz tracks and baroque violin/cello stuff you'd hear at a ballroom. What's more interesting is the fact that there's also quite a few super serious/ominous tracks that would play whenever Ciel and Sebastian are having a moment, my personal favourite being \"Si Deus Me Relinquit\" (Latin for \"If God Has Forsaken Me\"). I'd like to explain what it sounds like, but you should do yourself a favour and listen to it. The OP track, \"Monochrome Kiss\" by SID along with both ED tracks are highly addictive to listen to as well. Fun fact: the first ED track, \"I'm Alive\" by Becca is actually an American rock song, if I'm not mistaken.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the English dub, well... I've got rather mixed feelings about it. You see, unlike the Hellsing/Hellsing Ultimate dubs where actual people of British descent were hired to do the voice acting... the dub just uses American actors like Brina Palencia, J. Michael Tatum, Monica Rial, etc. and has them do their own take on a British accent. Now, Brina Palencia and J. Michael Tatum as Ciel and Sebastian respectively do an excellent job with the roles they've been given. You can still tell that they're faking an accent, but at least they're trying. Everyone else... not so much. The biggest problem I have with the dub is that some characters just speak normally but with the accent and others like the Phantomhive servants have Cockney accents which I find rather irritating. Monica Rial's work as Mey-Rin especially irritates me, but the Japanese VA is like that in the original I can't hold TOO much against her.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I take umbrage with is the fact that there are two... Indian characters in the show, and yet they're not voiced by amateur Indian VAs with a proper understanding of the English language. Funimation just had Christopher Ayres and Patrick Seitz go about their lines but with horribly exaggerated Indian accents. Why do I take umbrage with this? Well... fun fact about me: I'm Punjabi, and Punjab is a part of India! One of the things that I hate is whenever there's an Indian character on-screen, and they have a horribly exaggerated accent. Seriously, would it kill Funimation to just hire Salman Khan and Amitabh Bachchan to just do the voice acting for these two characters?\\n\\n\r\nNow, it's not like the dub is complete shit because that's far from the truth The ADR crew also did a great job of making sure the dialogue fit the mouth movements while making sure that the actors/actresses gave a good performance. I'm also guessing that the accents were used as a way of giving *some* semblance of authenticity. At the same time, I just die a little inside every time I hear Christopher Ayres, Patrick Seitz, or Monica Rial give their take on a horrible accent imitation. If anything, this dub is similar to the Kanon (2006) dub: the dub itself is solid stuff, but there's just that tiny little detail that just makes me want to make myself taller.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that baggage out of the way, let's wrap this up. Black Butler on the whole is just \"good.\" It's not a masterpiece like some of the overzealous fans like to claim it is, but it's also not shit like some of the others on here would like for you to believe. Now, reviews on the whole are a very subjective thing so obviously there's going to be a lot of areas that people disagree on. But at the same time, there are shows on the market that are a hell of a lot more painful to watch than this. If you want shit, don't turn to Kuroshitsuji. Turn to Sword Art Online. Just watch the first episode of Black Butler if you've got 20 minutes to spare. If you like what you see, keep going. If you don't, drop it altogether. It's just that simple. Alternatively, you can just watch the first 15 episodes and then move over to the infinitely superior Kuroshitsuji: Book of Circus. That works too. I also highly recommend reading the manga, as it's one hell of a good read.",

            "content": "So after some trial, tribulation, and mulling it over in my brain, I finally finished this show but wasn't fully sure what to think of it. Black Butler is a confusing show that I personally think has some pretty major identity issues going on. It's overall not that bad for a semi-shonen type show. The setting of Victorian England adds a unique setting and at times I found the supernatural element that gets added to the show enjoyably reminiscent to horror books I've read from the Gothic Victorian era such as Dracula and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Black Butler isbasically role-reversed Batman where Bruce Wayne's parents die and he turns into a bitter rich kid in short shorts who conducts all the business while Sebastian is more like Alfred if he could do all the stuff Batman does. And given the fangirl reaction to Bassie I'd say he fits the playboy role pretty well too. For the most part, the plot really plods about and throws it's identity confused weight around, but at least it looks cool while doing it. Sebastian is a great character; he's a gentleman loved by the ladies with cool demon powers. Granted it's a cop out that he's omnipotent thus never putting Ciel in a position of real danger but that's beside the point. Like Berserk, Sebastian is his Egg of the King, and when he's around, the tension of his struggle loses weight because he's no longer in any danger. However I think the show is given a great premise but doesn't do a lot with it, and when I finished it the entire experience felt like something of a rough draft of something brilliant rather than a complete show. The primary factor that goes along with that was the inconsistency of everything and it tends to jump around a little too much. Sometimes it wants to be really serious and then it'll throw something \"funny\" in, thus ruining the joke AND the serious tone and you're back to square 1. Sometimes it wants to be a supernatural detective story but goes too heavy on the supernatural element by throwing around the term \"soul reaper\" and \"death scythe\"  like it was trying to be Bleach, Soul Eater, and Dracula. I mean the guy who is the lead grim reaper is the same voice actor who plays Death himself in the dub of Soul Eater for God's sake. Sometimes it wants to give you an in depth experience into Ciel's mind and how he's feeling, and it never fully develops it. In addition to the inconsistency I was also really bothered by the stuff that was never really developed like Ciel's relationships with everyone, and the fact that there's never really a developed or clear cut villian or antagonist fighting against him (or if they are they're hastily thrown together). So despite the cool premise I'm gonna have to give Black Butler a passable rating. But if you're into more style-over substance shows and interesting Gothic settings, Black Butler is right up your dark London alley.",

            "content": "A butler is commonly defined as a male servant who takes charge of providing service to his master and keeping everything proper and organized in the household. Yana Toboso presents a devious twist to the meaning of a Butler, giving the audience on hell of a good show. Excuse the pun.\r\n~[S T O R Y]~ [9]\r\nViewers have seen it all: servants and masters working as partners in crime, so to speak. The master is devious, and the servant is obedient in general Japanimation. We've seen older men be served by seniors or young children. Yet there is a sense of originality captured in Kuroshitsuji. Neverbefore have we ever seen not only a professional and sophisticated demon butler, but a butler that can definitely outshine the common traits of a servant. Kuroshitsuji displays a series of mysteries inside and outside the Phantomhive household, spurring great thought into the audience as to who is involved, what is going on, and of course: WHY. Not only that, but Toboso knocks us out with twists never to be expected. There are dark themes weaved into the plot, but Toboso attempts to calm us down by providing us a nice handful of humour in between episodes - especially the antics of Finny, Meilin, Bard, and our little old tea-drinking butler Tanaka whom Sebastian respects surprisingly so. Although the series is still running anime and manga-wise, the plot gradually grows stronger along with our mental and visual appetite for knowing more on the backgrounds of Ciel Phantomhive and Sebastian Michaelis. \\n\\n\r\n~[A R T]~ [9]\\n\r\nLondon during the Victorian era is where Kuroshitsuji is set. The art is done well enough for the viewer to realize that it is during the nineteenth century London without being informed of its setting. The artists aside from Toboso who have designed the characters and sets have presented a nice taste to the Victorian era, such as the historical city streets, the enchanting landscape of Phantomhive manor, and the eerie scenes of reveries and places where Ciel and his team are compelled to go - such as cemeteries, haunting passageways and of course the base where our beloved Undertaker resides. The opening animation theme gives us a sense of experimental art: consisting of a sense of grunge followed by dark, elegant art that is weaved into the story's style. The reason why I had not marked the art category a 10 is due to the ending animation theme. The cute scrolling cartoon that separates itself from the general art of the anime leaves the audience wondering whether they are attempting to add random humour to the end or not. Were the ending to be just as beautiful as the beginning theme along with the rest of the animation in the series, the art would've recieved a perfect score.\\n\\n\r\n~[S O U N D]~ [9]\\n\r\nNormally in an anime such as Kuroshitsuji, one would expect the musical scores to consist of classical music and gregorian chants. Nonetheless, the series goes slightly beyond the music that would stereotypically match the setting where the anime takes place. The classical music and gregorian chants capture the essence of a dark, dramatic anime. The rock music flowing at the ending theme of the show gives the anime a connection to a modern age of rock and roll. The lyrics to the beginning and ending themes match the anime almost close enough, as though the musical artists created their songs just for the show's sake. The background music in random scenes gives us a sense of what to expect: epiphanies, a comedic episode, dark and nostalgic reminiscence, et cetera. Yet the music is not too obvious. The sounds are not cheesy unlike other animes set around the nineteenth century. They relax us emotionally yet drive our minds wild out of raging curiousity.\\n\\n\r\n~[C H A R A C T E R]~ [9]\\n\r\nDaisuke Ono gives Sebastian Michaelis his signature smooth, demonic voice that no other seiyuu could ever match. Sebastian is the pure personification of a demon butler, what with his eloquent nature and satirical humour. Demons are often looked upon as ravenous creatures who are hideous inside and out. Yet Sebastian gives a whole new definition to the name of a demon. He is the subject of pure sin, provoking all seven of the sins [more in the manga than the anime] to humans or even observing them in the human world. He does not give into temptation and turns into an angel like other stereotypical animes. He keeps up his sinful guard, making the anime a more interesting watch. He is mysterious, smooth, and attractive enough to make him appear more like a talented, demonic angel than a regular demon in disguise. Moreover, Ciel Phantomhive is not your typical 12 year old. The murder of his parents followed by the destruction of his home and childhood brought forth a dramatic transition no one would ever expect of the boy. He is more mature than his age, seeing as he is the proud owner of a toy company along with playing his role as the Queen's underdog. Together, the two make a fantastic, brilliant team that leaves no stone unturned and no mystery left folded. The other characters seem slightly minor earlier in the series. But as time progresses, their ranks incline and make us wonder more about them. How did Finny become so strong? What dwells in the mind of Elizabeth Middleford? How is Tanaka able to change heights from a short old man to a tall sophisticate? Ignorance definitely is bliss when watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\n~[E N J O Y M E N T  &amp;  O V E R A L L]~ [9]\\n\r\nOverall, the series is worth enjoying. The anime is yet to be complete, and the manga seems far from over. We are filled with a sensational tension to know the answers behind the questions, know the solutions to the mystery, and understand how our world and the world in the Victorian era are not that different. Both worlds share their moments of profound mystery, moments of drama and laughter, moments of sin versus virtue... I am definitely looking forward to what other tricks Yana Toboso has left up the sleeve. And if you were an individual who prefers tricks and treats, then allow the black butler to serve you. :]",

            "content": "Usually I wouldn't waste any energy on reviewing such a bad product of entertainment industry, but I, like all people, sometimes just need to let myself go and get the burden of my back. Let me apologise beforehand for such an obnoxiously long review. So let's go.\r\nIf there is one sentence that could perfectly describe this series it would be: \"What an utter waste of potential!\"\r\nThe premise is a boy selling his soul to a demon and then solving mysteries related to the underground society in Victorian-era London. What an epic anime it could have been; a mix of Death Note, Hellsing and Sherlock Holmes- a guarantee of success. But it became the school example of wasting potential instead. Some series just don't have the premise that could make them good. But this - man I was disappointed! \\n\\n\r\nThe manga had several aspects that disappointed me, but there were other, redeeming points, and while it wasn't a masterpiece I hoped it would be, it was a decent story to pass time with. The anime on the other hand...\\n\\n\r\nPLOT: 3\\n\r\nThe fact that manga was ongoing and provided little material to work with is no excuse. There were enough chapters to make some 10-12 episodes. Instead, they stuck to the manga for the first 6 episodes and then dropped it. The first 3 episodes served as an introduction of the main cast of characters and featured little plot. Episodes 4,5 and 6 were \"Jack the Ripper Arc\". Speaking strictly about the plot, it was relatively good so far. Even episode 7 was promising - everything looked and smelled like The Hound of the Baskervilles. But beginning with ep 8, it was all over. The series featured a large number of \"arcs\", very loosely connected, and a number of filler episodes between them.\\n\r\nThe basic ideas of the arcs were not bad, but they were horribly executed, too fast-paced ( most of them just 2 ep long ) and ended up making little if no sense whatsoever. The plot holes were not a major issue because the plot itself was just too incoherent. There were way too many facepalm and \"WTF?\" moments to enjoy anything and I ended up wondering if they were scr*wing the plot and basic ideas on purpose. 3 for the Jack the Ripper Arc.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 7\\n\r\nOne of the main problems of this series is inconsistency. It can't decide whether it wants to be Holmes-like, or angsty, or action series, or supernatural, or just yaoi/ bishounen fanservice for the peanut-brained 13-14 year-old girls. It unsuccessfully tries to be all at once, with the latest category ( fanservice ) prevailing. The animation follows the pattern. At times it's brilliantly depicted 19th century London, very dark and realistic. Then it's less realistic with modern hand guns and cars, thus spoiling the spirit and atmosphere of Victorian era. And then... we have domiantrix outfits, Italian mafia in modern suits, Gothic lolita and Steampunk fashion and very non-Victorian behaviour. It won't bother some, but if you're going with historical setting, then make it convincing, please. Some scenes are well animated and coloured and the visual effects flow well. But then they go with the cheap chibi animation and very bright colours. Pick one! The only bits of series that I find flawlessly animated are the first opening theme and the second ending theme. Nothing particularly special or stunning, but they are well-balanced and go well with the music.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7.5\\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself is pretty good, one of the highlights of the show, but it's too quiet for the most of the series. The opening and ending theme songs are well-chosen, especially \"Lacrimosa\", my personal favourite. I like how they use Latin songs and combination of classical and electric instruments. The jazz tunes caught me off guard a bit, but they are actually quite good and give the soundtrack a distinctive level. If only the other aspects of the series were developed as good as the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:  3.3\\n\r\nCiel Phantomhive - In the manga, a well developed character, mixture of Artemis Fowl and Near from Death Note with a strong touch of evilness. Albeit suffering a terrible fate, he stays strong and becomes more ruthless and evil as the story progresses. A spoiled brat, but I like him both as a character and as a person ( there are many similarities between him and I ). In the anime, he's an angsty, two-dimensional character, whose motivations are unclear. Apart from being \"out-of-character\", his actions are very inconsistent and you can clearly see that the manga Ciel and anime Ciel are two different people. Shota and bishouned tones exponentially multiplied in the anime.\\n\r\nSebastian Michaelis - First of all, I should point out that Sebastian isn't and cannot possibly be a Gary Stue, simply because he's not human. Yes, he's almighty and perfect, but he's a demon. What good would a demon be if he can't beat up your enemies and make you some fine tea? The bad thing about this aspect of Sebastian is that it backfires when it comes to the plot. In combination with helpless Ciel and incompetent plot-makers, Sebastian becomes \"deus ex machina\", the solution to every problem and every situation. His wittiness and teasing of his master vanish with ep7 and he shows some serious OOC-ness in the final episodes, when he ABANDONS CIEL ( against the unbreakable contract he's made with him ). In the end, he's nothing but a sex object for the fangirls to fangirl over ( and my only comment to his \"special\" relationship with Ciel is: paedophilia is not sexy/cute! \\n\r\nGrell Sutcliff - The potential for the badest psycho badass of all time. Had they made him female and more psychotic, Grell could have rivaled Alucard. Instead, we got the overly gay Reaper who likes to wear short shorts. God...\\n\r\nMost of the canon characters are, apart from Madam Red, given no or little ( good ) exposition and don't do much to make the plot going. The only exception is Fred Abberline, who's role in the series is far greater than in the manga.\\n\r\nAll non-canon characters are piss-poor and cheap, not to mention badly designed.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL IMPRESSION: 5\\n\r\nRuining the premise with the awful plot was bad enough, but the amount of fanservice destroyed it beyond repair. Although I detest yaoi and similar perversions, maybe I could have survived it. But the inconsistency of the quality of animation, mixing of so many genres, the horrible plot, the bad characters... it was too much. I watched it through to the end simply because I dislike not finishing thing that I've started. And I wanted to have all the knowledge of the crap I'm reviewing. So here's my final mark. After viewing the anime I started to appreciate the manga more. To conclude this I'll say again: what a waste.\\n",

            "content": "If this was a one-line review, it would be \"A great premise but sadly a bad execution.\" This anime struggles to find a balance between it's serious overarching story and the less serious comedy of it, a comedy that's often immature and just plain unfunny. Around every turn the anime is clearly struggling between being serious and being immature, resulting in a weird mix of the two that's just not appealing at all. \r\nThe overarching story has amazing potential, when I read the premise I thought that this might be the not-so-famous cousin of Code Geass, but I was sorely disappointed. While the overall premiseof Kuroshitsuji looks great on paper, the execution is clearly lacking. \\n\\n\r\nThe overarching story of Kuroshitsuji is quite serious and you'll notice that early on, in the first few episodes even. But, as the anime moves on you begin to notice that the other things added together to make the complete story aren't so serious at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe comic 'relief' that this anime likes so much quickly becomes so abundant that the serious bits instead become the relief. Unlike in Baccano, where the comic relief was memorable and well executed, the comic 'relief' in Kuroshitsuji is too much, too often, and most of the time it's not comedy but instead just plain immature and silly. \\n\\n\r\nWhile these characters are out of place in this anime, the two main characters of the anime are very enjoyable. Ciel Phantomhive doesn't really have a particularly interesting or great backstory to him but that doesn't matter because he's well executed. His butler, who also is a main character, is great as well. It was enjoyable seeing their stories unravel between the immaturity of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, there's not much to be said of the story and characters aside of the yaoi undertones. This is another silly and immature part of the anime. I don't mind so much the yaoi undertones between the the butler and his master, because they are just that, undertones, but when we get a naked dog-man jumping around and licking people then it gets a bit too much. And, of course the female cast is there every step to bleed their brains out of their noses as soon as something even remotely homoerotic takes place. \\n\\n\r\nThe animations aren't deserving of any praise either. While they aren't bad they certainly aren't good either. I'm not an animation buff but I clearly noticed how the animators had problems with consistency when it came to the size of people and objects. Another thing was the fact that perspective seemed to be skewed every now and then. The animations aren't so bad as to make you jump up and yell, but if you're remotely interested in good animation this anime will leave you with a somewhat bad taste lingering in your mouth. Again, it's not that bad and if the other aspects of the anime seems to appeal to you the animations certainly shouldn't drive you away, they're not that bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is again not something that I can say I noticed too much of either way. There wasn't anything either good or bad enough to make me notice it. Maybe this is just a failure on my part as a viewer and listener, but I didn't notice anything too good or too bad about the sound. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the sole redeeming quality of this anime is the interaction between Ciel Phantomhive and his butler. The serious overarching story is directly countered by the amount of silly and immature comedy you're served each and every episode. It takes a massively long time for the anime to actually get to the main story, and I had more than one moment where I sat and wondered when on earth they were going to get on with it. The anime is also clearly struggling with finding its place between being a serious drama and being a silly comedy. There are very serious things going on in here, there's even an implied sex-scene that's handled with some degree of maturity until one of the comic relief cast decide to bleed all over the walls with her nose. I guess that's what plaguing this anime, the somewhat serious story that's constantly being countered by a massive amount of silly comedy. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I don't think this will be a very enjoyable anime for anyone. If you're looking for a somewhat serious anime you're not looking for it in the right place. On the other hand, if you're just looking for something to laugh at this clearly isn't it either. I laughed while watching this anime, but it wasn't because it was fun, it was because it was immature and cringeworthy.",

            "content": "This anime is one of the most breathtaking, gloriously beautiful masterpieces that I have ever seen. It manages to mix in character development, humour and action at the same time. They are all well balanced, so there isn't too much of comedy and such. Though it may not look like it, Kuroshitsuji is a dark series and thus there are lots of thought provoking themes and symbolism. The series is such that you could be crying with either happiness or sadness with the character. To be frank the show had me crying at times I thought I wouldn't. Though there are some questions left unansweredat the end, it is still worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nStory [9]\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the storyline was unique in its own way. The beginning arc is by far one of the best I've seen. But after it strayed away from the manga, it got a bit floppy around the middle, leaving some unanswered questions and vague hints. The series could definitely maximise its potential if not for the somewhat weaker storyline in the middle. But of course, this is merely my opinion.  Don't worry, though it went in a different direction than the manga, the ending is not like soul eater's *cough* The ending was AMAZING, there hasn't been any other ending that made me emotional and depressed for a few days other than FMA, CG and GoTF. If not for the loose ends, it would have been a 10 for sure.\\n\\n\r\nArt [10]\\n\\n\r\nThe art is one of the drawing points that led me to watch this series. Sebastian and Ciel's designs are beautiful, and there are hardly any scenes in the anime that makes the characters look weird. 19th Century London was also amazingly done, and it feels like I could have been there. The outfits and also the ambience was equally well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10]\\n\\n\r\nWow. The soundtrack of Kuroshitsuji is I can confidently say, the BEST I have ever heard. The OST doesn't comprise of pointless yelling and electric guitars. It takes a more .. classical and latin like hymns approach, can't exactly describe it. There are many beautiful melodies that will make you take notice of it immediately. For me, I was so transfixed by the music at the end of episode 3 that I missed out what was being said and had to replay. The songs play a vital role in the emotional impact on the audience. The end of the final episode, especially, wouldn't have so much of an impact if played without sound. The ED 2 , Lacrimosa is so hauntingly beautiful. Matches the dark gothic theme perfectly. The seiyuus were all also extremely good, portraying the characters the way they are supposed to be! The best to me was of course Sebastian. His low voice just makes you melt.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10]\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is amazing. You can see the difference from the beginning and toward the end of the show. Their emotional dilemmas are not portayed as an obstruction, but as a way to help the characters grow. Madame Red in particular is the character that I was riveted upon. The way her character came to be, and how it ended.. Just speechless. Ciel is also the same. But no spoilers here!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment + Overall [10]\\n\\n\r\nEverything falls into place perfectly, making this anime an amazing artwork, especially with its design and soundtrack. God the ED 2 is still stuck in my head even now, it's just so hauntingly beautiful. Though I was skeptical about this anime initially, I'm glad I picked it up. What are you waiting for? Watch it NOW",

            "content": "The real crux of why this anime fails to have any impact is the characters. Not a single one is capable of pulling off the swagger they purport to have, summed up by the incredibly terrible \"catch phrase\" of the butler being \"one hell of a Butler,\" which is always said so apathetically that it makes it even more boring. The main shota-boy is the worst of all, as Ceil manages to pull off nothing at all. Ceil is constantly bratty without being really grating or especially irate because all he likes to do is complain. The series plays up his parents' death making himungodly fixated on revenge, but even that passion is never actually displayed in the series. Another good example of a purely character related flaw is how much time people spend blushing over Sebastian, each time being groan worthy.\\n\\n\r\nNow, of course, the anime had to have some reason I kept watching (even though I was playing Ocarina of Time the whole time), and that was because the plot did have a decent trajectory. It was interesting to see them play out the demons' existence and purpose and Ceil's quest, although it was of course bogged down repeatedly by things like the aforementioned lack of passion and the fact that when it did choose to finally fixate on characters, they were often horrible.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the characters are drawn is horrible, but the way the rest of this is drawn is great. I could mostly ignore the characters and look at the otherwise pretty art though (except when it was terribly chibified or the like).\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is thoroughly mediocre while the music is pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was not enjoyable, really, but was not godawful at the same time, as contradictory as that might seem. I still would never recommend anyone to watch this with so many series that actually achieve being \"epic,\" not merely pretending like this one does.",

That's not me, but it explains the rating of this series to some extent. If that's what you want, you might like this show.\r\nThe plot and characters also bother me. The main character is all style and no substance. On the other hand, if you want towatch a cartoon kid pretend to be brilliant and important while doing nothing but look fancy in expensive cartoon clothes while his butler does all the work, this might be the show for you. The butler is also shallow. He has unspecified powers with no apparent limits, and no real personality. The plot also only pretends to have any depth whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is fine, though not great. Animation is OK for most parts, but the 3d things look bad and the action scenes are terrible.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this series is strictly inferior to Chevalier d'eon and El Hazard the Magnificent World for any kind of person I can think of, and not worth watching if you don't like crossdressing guys and/or yaoi.\\n",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji or black butler was one hell of an anime. the mix of mythical creatures such as shinigamis, demons, angels with the Britain history is well done. The story is based on some historical facts but of course 99% of the serie is fictive. One great example of a historical fact that they used is Jack The Ripper. The way that they explain those cases with those mythical creatures, is just as it could\u2019ve happened in history without that anyone would\u2019ve noticed it. So basicly they use those creatures to let those cases make a lot more sense.\r\nCiel Phantomhive is however he is still achild the head of the Phantomhive house/company that does all kind of underground work for the queen. The fact why he is the head of the corporation is because his mansion was fired and both his parents died because of that. After that full of despair and seeking for revenge he made a deal with a demon. The demon may eat his soul when he got his revenge. After they made the deal the demon becomes his butler, able to do the most impossible things and doing/accomplishing everything he has been ordered to. When people has something as \u201cwhat the fuck?!?!\u201d when they saw what he did/can do. He always simply respond \u201cthat it is only normal for a servant of the Phantomhive family to be able to do such things\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nIn this serie you see the not official power of the queen and a lot of british culture from the end of the 19th century. However his mansion is in Scotland he usually travels a lot to solve the problems of the queen where he becomes confrontated with some people he wants revenge on.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion it is one of the classic animes that you should\u2019ve watched if you are a anime fan. However there are some reasons why it doesn\u2019t deserve a high point in my opinion. First of all there are a lot of fillers, things as episode 1 and other episodes are not bad but it doesn\u2019t gives something extra at the story. I think they should\u2019ve been ova. Second I don\u2019t think they have completely used the potential it had. you\u2019re probably asking yourself now \u201cwhy do I need to watch it then?\u201d. Well the biggest reason for me are the characters. Ciel and Sebastian (the butler) are super good and original characters that you won\u2019t find in just any anime. Another great thing about it is how good some episodes are. Episodes such as episode 6,.. and the end also made the serie. It is very weird but after a bunch of fillers there is randomly a super episode that has the feeling of a wonderful end. Everybody probably knows the feeling of a unbelievable end well here they are randomly placed in the serie as well.\\n\\n\r\nFor the rest the music fits the story perfectly, it basically is dark church music for the butler and other dark moments and kinda jazz for the normal moments, with this used in the right way it gives the extra right touch it needed. The drawings are nothing special but surely not bad. The most amusing moments for me where when the butler follows his orders, that just keeps surprising me. The characters aren\u2019t bad but nothing special however as I said, Ciel and Sebastian are just superb in every way.\\n",

            "content": "This one was&hellip; interesting. I was originally going to avoid it because of the pedophile vibes that I was given. A show about a young boy and his creepy butler just sounded wrong&hellip; However, I decided to watch it, and grabbed the subbed version from Shinsen&hellip; The OP was pretty good&hellip; there are certainly better, but there are many worse ones this season. The ED doesn&rsquo;t have a good song, but the mountains of chibi awesome-ness make up for it. The art is very nice, all the backgrounds are hand painted, and the character art is decently consistent. The CG (what little they use) tendsto be a bit dodgy in spots, but I think that can be overlooked. The story of this anime focuses on Ciel Phantomhive, the orphaned heir to the Phantomhive estate. How his parents died hasn&rsquo;t been established yet, but it apparently caused him to make a contract with a demon&hellip; who is his butler. Let me say here, that Sebastian (insert Lucky * Star reference here) is the single most badass butler ever. Watch the show for yourself if you don&rsquo;t believe me. I&rsquo;m going to have a hard time summarizing the first episode, but I can say some other things. The atmosphere is very good at shifting. It can be comical and ridiculous the first moment, but then be pants-wettingly creepy. Not many anime these days can switch back and forth so well. Ciel comes off as pretty creepy as small boys with eyepatches come. The rest of the house staff is comical, complete with the girl who loves Sebastian. Sebastian is honestly the best of the whole character set. He switches back and forth from comical to creepy along with the rest of the show. He has red eyes, pallid white skin, and dark hair (as well as an angular face, which makes him remind me of the black swordsman from Comedy.) From what I can tell, he is a demon, but I can only tell from the vague description I can get from the show. He says &ldquo;I am but a butler,&rdquo; but the way he says it, it can be also translated as &ldquo;I am but a demon.&rdquo; Anyway, Sebastian is obviously the most badass demon butler to ever grace the screen. I really don&rsquo;t have much more to say on this, because I have no plot summary. Watch it if you want, you will probably enjoy it. I enjoyed it enough to bring me to the second episode, providing Shinsen gets the subs out with decent speed. It really isn&rsquo;t half bad, and it was a lot better than I expected it. To sum it up, less pedophiliac, more ridiculous, and certainly more entertaining then I expected it to be. Check it out if you want to. I give it a total score 0f 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nProduction by A-1 Pictures. Airs on Thursday. Subs done by Shinsen.\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review and I choose to write it about the anime \"Kuroshitsuji\" Or \"Black Butler\". So let's get on with it, yes?\r\n~STORY & CHARACTERS~ Both rating 8/10\r\nThe story itself was overall enjoyable, though it's not something \"completely\" unheard of before. The anime \"Chrono Crusade\" has a slightly similar plot. I think what makes Kuroshitsuji different was the characters. To me the characters were mostly all lovable, even Ciel was, though at times he was an annoying little brat. But that was part of his charm ^^;; I absolutely LOVED Sebastian. I mean, there's literally nothing he can't do xD. And he's alwaysso cool and calm about it :P \\n\\n\r\n~ART~ Rating 9/10\\n\r\nI loved the art. I think I loved the outfits the most due the old Victorian era feel to them. Especially Ciel, Elizabeth and Sebastian were always very well dressed. The character design was nice and simple, but elegant enough to fit the context of late 19th century London. THOUGH, sometimes the men, namely for example Ciel, Finny and Ash, were drawn a little too feminine for my taste and I think that's why I gave the art only a 9 and not a 10. The scenery was beautiful and well done, which I appreciate very much in any anime ^^\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~ Rating 10/10\\n\r\nAll of the chosen theme songs fit the series quite well. I liked the ending songs the most, especially \"Lacrimosa\" by Kalafina. I thought it was very befitting of Kuroshitsuji: the darkish and mysterious feel without being downright emo. Also the voice acting was great. Every character had the \"right\" voice, as in the one that suited them the most in my opinion. I was extremely glad that Ciel didn't have the typical \"little boy\" girly voice, because it would probably made me enjoy his character a lot less ^^;;. The sound effects and others were all great as well.\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~ Rating 10/10\\n\r\nHell yeah I enjoyed it :D. It's very hard for me to come by an anime I truly enjoy (Yes I'm picky =__=\") And I had my doubts about Kuroshitsuji at first. But I definitely don't regret watching it. It made me laugh (a lot), it frustrated me (^^;), it even made me cry (can't say why :X) and that, to me, proves it's a good anime. Plus all of the things I mentioned above. It's most definitely worth watching. \\n\\n\r\n~OVERALL~ Rating 9/10\\n\r\nAbsolutely a \"must-watch\". Period. :P Everything coordinates so well, no matter how odd some things and/or characters are.  \\n\\n\\n",

He sold his soul to a demon, which is bad enough, but it wasn't even to save a life, it was to get revenge. I can never look past it. I hated him from the first scene I saw him. Thankfully, this show is not stupid enough to frame the decision as a good one, or Ciel as a good person. But it's hard to ignore the center of the plot. \r\nThen there is Sebastian. Igrew to dislike him more and more as the show went on. I know the ladies love him, but that smile is something that makes me want to gag. The catchphrase \"one hell of a butler\", which is actually pretty cool, gets ruined with incessant repetition. I don't find him charming.\\n\r\nThe story is pretty clever, the rest of the characters are good, the art is great, and the show in general is pretty funny, but the two main characters are big things to get wrong.\\n\r\nBut the thing that pisses me off the most about this show is that I couldn't stop watching. I have serious problems with this show, but there was no part of me that wanted to drop the series. I'm not sure why; maybe the positives I mentioned kept me invested. That's why I have to give it at least a 6. I will also see the second season. I hope it is better, because this show obviously did something right.",

I actually enjoyed the first episode, as the homoerotic overtones and undertones were kept at a minimum, but as the series progressed, it became a shota-fest.

            "content": "Black Butler is an odd mix of comedy, drama, fantasy and yaoi undertones. There are few anime out there that can combine comedy and drama without ruining one of these elements, sadly enough Black Butler is not one of these shows. The comedy totally ruins the drama and is often unfunny and immature, the bishies and yaoi tropes were unnecessary and the fantasy didn't make sense. But for some reason, this anime is in the top 50 most popular anime on MAL, why? Probably because it had bishies, a hot butler, nice music, pretty animation and a gay death god that tries to make senpainotice him, oh so hilarious. \\n\\n\r\n~Story~ 3/10\\n\r\nWe meet our main character, a 10 year old boy (who looks like a girl) and gives his soul in exchange for revenge against the people who killed his parents and tortured him. Two years have passed and our main character, Ciel Phantomhive, has a demon butler who helps him with his revenge (and cleans his house). Though they don't really seem to care about taking revenge, because they're way to busy with drinking tea and solving crimes. The queen decided to make Ciel her personal detective for some kind of reason, we never really discover why, but now Ciel wastes his time with solving crimes. And for some kind of reason are there always supernatural creatures involved in those crimes, so Sebastian can show of his fabulous demon fighting skills, while fighting them. The first episode was amazing, there was a dark atmosphere, the main characters looked interesting and the plot twist near the end was great. And then everything went downhill, our main character and his demon butler get a mission, they discover that something supernatural is involved, they solve the mystery and Sebastian says \"I'm one hell of a butler\", then there is another mission or a filler, in the last case the viewer is tortured with the Phantomhive servants (also known as comedic relief no one asked for) screwing up things and sucking at everything except for killing people. This kind of \"comedic relief\" totally ruined the drama in the anime, even a clich\u00e9 sad backstory didn't make these servants more interesting, because their only use in this anime is screwing up everything. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting also fails, no one behaves like they're supposed to do in the Victorian age. Still, the first part of the story is decent, some episodes were actually good, but the second half was just a convoluted mess. Nothing that happened made sense, characters behaved out of character (Sebastian leaves Ciel for a stupid reason), plot twists came out of nowhere and unexplained supernatural occurrences happened. Only the ending was great, the last minutes of the show were better than the whole second half together. But then, the creators decided to ruin that by creating a sequel that just erased the great ending of the first anime, like it never happened. Amazing job writers!\\n\r\n{CONCLUSION}\\n\r\nThe story was decent in the first half and a total mess in the second half. There were way too many fillers and none of these fillers were funny or interesting, they were just a waste of time. Also the gay undertones (everything about Ciel, Grell's behavior towards Sebastion, crossdressing for no good reason and so on) were unnecessary. It didn't add anything to the plot, but it just attracted those annoying teenage girls who love yaoi pairings and name themselves 'missPhantomhive489' on YouTube.  \\n\\n\r\n~Art~ 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation was very good, especially the backgrounds and clothes. The anime is set the Victorian age setting and the buildings were very realistic and fitted the time period (the behavior of the characters didn't). The character designs were quite feminine, Ciel really looks like a girl even without wearing a dress, but not bad. Every character had their own distinct features, which made them stand out. The animation was also pretty good during the fights and during the comedic relief moments (I still hate these moments, but the animation looked good)\\n\r\n{CONCLUSION}\\n\r\nThe animation was great. Yes, bishies everywhere but the backgrounds were spectacular. Not a single character looked boring and the clothes were very detailed. The animation was probably one of the best things about this show. And I have to admit, Sebastian throwing knives and forks at random baddies  looks extremely epic. \\n\\n\r\n~Music~ 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening song \"Kiss of Monochrome\" is great and really fits the more dramatic parts of the show. The first ending song \"I'm ALIVE!\" is an upbeat J-pop song that fits the stupid comedic relief moments. The chibi art style of the animation of the ending song was actually quite amusing. But the second ending song is on a whole new level, \"Lacrimosa\" is sad, melancholic and extremely beautiful. The background music was nothing special but certainly not bad and the voice acting was very good. Especially Sebastian's voice actor did an amazing job. The music was simply put great.\\n\r\n{CONCLUSION}\\n\r\nThe first ending song was okay and the opening and second ending song were amazing. The background music was good and the (Japanese) voice actors did a great job. The best thing about Black Butler was the music, and that is not meant as an insult, the music was just damn great.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~ 2/10\\n\r\nOur main character is a snobby, spoiled, edgy, teenage bishie, sorry Ciel but you're not only an annoying person, you're also a bad character. His motivations are unclear, his behavior is inconsistent and drinking tea does not make anyone seem 'cool'. Also, he's just a walking mannequin, the creators were too busy with making him wear fancy dresses to give him a likeable (or at least tolerable) personality. Sebastian is just a hot and perfect butler, he seems more like a perfect boyfriend than a scary demon. Which was probably on purpose, because now the fangirls have someone to ship Ciel with, or themselves. Though he has as much depth as a paddling pool, he's enjoyable to watch (something that can't be said about Ciel). His fighting scenes were pretty cool and he has style. And of course, let's not forget 'I'm one hell of a butler'. He's a badly written character who's a joy to watch. And then we have the Phantomhive servants, they were useless, whiny, annoying and not funny. Their 'sad' background stories were extremely clich\u00e9 and they ruined every attempt to make this show dramatic (or a bit more mature). Grell is a gay shinigami, who wants to bang Sebastian and just like the servants, his role is to ruin every attempt to make this show serious, oh and his constant nosebleeds are not funny at all. And there is Elizabeth, the most whiny and useless love interest for a protagonist since Misa from Death Note (and even Misa has more brains than this walking candy cane) and her attempts to make everything 'cute' annoyed the heck out of me. I was literally cheering when Ciel tried to slap her. Every other side character is either boring or horrible (aside from Undertaker, he was pretty cool).\\n\r\n{CONCLUSION}\\n\r\nIt it so difficult to create cast with at least one character who's tolerable, let alone well written? Ciel is a edgy, whiny and spoiled teenage boy living in Victorian England, but behaving like he lives in the present. Sebastian (that name is so damn clich\u00e9 for an English butler) is way too perfect and lacks any form of depth, but it's a joy to watch him kill people with knives and forks. Grell is a joke, he's gay for Sebastian and that's everything about him. The servants are annoying 'comedic relief' and Elizabeth has a place in my top ten most annoying anime love interests. She did not a single useful thing in 24 episodes, not a single thing! The rest of the cast is not even worth talking about and Undertaker is okay.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ 5/10\\n\r\nThis was my third anime and when I watched it for the first time, I actually enjoyed it, but when I rewatched it, I realized how flawed this show actually is. It is possible to enjoy this anime when you're either new to anime in general, when you just want to have some fun with a supernatural show without thinking to much about the story or the characters or when you love yaoi undertones and bishies in dresses. It's not a horrible show, but the plot is a mess, the characters are weak and the yaoi undertones are annoying. Still, if you have a lot of time to waste or you just want to turn of your brain, then you might want to watch this show, in every other case, there are way better anime out there!  \\n\r\n{CONCLUSION}\\n\r\nIt's an under average show. Certainly not the worst anime, but also not worth the praise it gets and the enormous fan base. If you value you free time and prefer good anime, I would suggest that you skip this show. Oh and fans, can you please stop making creepy Ciel x Sebastian fanart? That's pedofilic demon yaoi, just don't. Peace!",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji, or Black butler. What an interesting concept. Supernatural beings living in the 1800s London. Having a demon as your butler, living in a mansion, doing detective work for the queen her majesty. \r\nI have not watched any of its sequel yet, so I'm reviewing this based purely on the first season. \r\nSTORY (Concept 4/5, Development 2/5) \r\nStory is a fairly weird part of the show. The structure of the arcs reminds me of Darker than Black and Cowboy Bebop. Every episode or sometimes every two episodes concerns of a certain event that involves certain characters. The problem is, instead of leaving the arcs tothemselves, the writer keeps elements presented from these arcs weaving around until the very end where the grand finale that draws all the things happened before together. \\n\\n\r\nI dislike shows that doesn't have a continuous plot, so I don't like how the story is told in Black butler.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem I have with this type of story is that, the author tries too hard to make all the connections, but fails to make the individual arcs interesting. \\n\\n\r\n---The following paragraph may be considered a semi-spoiler for some audience---\\n\\n\r\nThe Indian Prince arc for example, serves a purpose of introducing the Queen's butler. Not that there is anything wrong with it, it is just that the butler barely got any screen time in the arc. This leads to the problem that when Queen's butler actually becomes a major character, nobody knows anything about him and the \"connection\" the writer tries to make starts to feel forced. \\n\\n\r\n---Potential Spoiler Ends---\\n\\n\r\nWhat frustrates me the most is that the ending of the series is actually really cool and awesome. Despite the fact that I forced myself to go over the series so hard before I reached somewhere around episode 16, the ending did make me say \"Wow.\" \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I'd like the mention is that most of the time I always thought this is a slice of life anime. It just doesn't feel serious enough with all those fooling around by Ciel's servants and other trolling characters. Which means this anime cannot, and should not be marathoned if you want to enjoy it to the fullest. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think on a grand scheme the story is actually pretty good. But when you actually go in and enjoy it, it fails to grab my attention and it was BORING. \\n\\n\r\nBut why would so many people love this series so much? Let's go in to the characters. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (Design 5/5, Development 3/5)\\n\\n\r\nThe main Characters are Ciel and Sebastian. \\n\\n\r\nThe mighty Sebastian is really a virus. I do admit I fangirled him quite a bit as a healthy heteralsexual male. He is simply so cool and calm and awesome. He is artistic, gentle and occasionally, inhuman on both emotional and physical levels. Sebastian Serves as a ultimate weapon that only unleash his full power at critical moments. \\n\\n\r\nThat alone is already great enough for people to stay in front of the screen and watch the show. The problem is however, Sebastian never needs to consider any potential danger serious matter until the very last arc. This bothers me a little bit since Sebastian did not change at all throughout the plot: His relationship with Ciel doesn't change and his ideology stay intact. \\n\\n\r\nCiel is a 12 year old noble who is the last seed of the grand Phantomhive family. By making a contract with Sebastian, he escaped the fire that killed both his parents. As a young noble who suddenly becomes responsible for his family pride and duty, he grow as a determined child over the course of time spent with his Butler. Ciel, unlike Sebastian, did change his ideology and experienced some personal growth from the events, which is quite pleasant. \\n\\n\r\nCiels' other servents, (A chef, a gardener, a maid, and a recorder) all serve as plot relieves. Even though they are eventually introduced with background stories at the end of show, they are... irrelevant for the must part of the show. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters such as grim reapers' association, which acts as a third party that always help (except the first arc) Ciel and Sebastian unintentionally, is an interesting addition as well. Nothing such as development can be considered, so they are purely for the supporting role. \\n\\n\r\nTo wrap things up, the characters are interesting, and I see how the female audience enjoys it so much. But objectively speaking, they are not that well presented. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGRAPHIC (Art 5/5, Animation 2/5)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very beautiful. It shows the wonderful landscape of the old England. The character are also very pretty and appealing, Ladies are pretty and the men are cool, especially Sebastian. However, many scenes are way too simplified and becomes like kids' comic style drawing. I suppose this is just my personal dislike since some people like lots of funny and plot relieves. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation however, fairly weak. The action scenes are not well rendered, which makes them... fairly boring. That said, Sebastian's power are still amusing to watch. Still images are literally found anywhere to the point where I felt closing my eyes and listen to the anime is more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nArt is very good, but the way they animated isn't that great. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (OP/ED 2/3, OST 2/3, Dub 4/4)\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending, to be honest are very great songs. I actually like them so much that I don't skip them and enjoy the beautiful combination of animation and sound. However, if you remove the graphic and listen to the songs by themselves... They become quite forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nOST are also on a okay level. Definitely not memorable. But they are not trash either. They are simply too plain and doesn't stand out with the dialogues. But after all, they are only OSTs, they are just supposed to be served as background in the show.  \\n\\n\r\nHa. I have no freaking idea why you should resist the dub at all. Unless you are a native British person who hates American people try to speak in British accent, there is absolutely no reason to not like the dub. This is not saying the Original Japanese is not good however. Both are very emotional and well acted. But why would you NOT want BRITISH English in a show that has the old BRITAIN as the stage??? \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nI did not like it for the majority of the show, but the ending sort of made everything up. As a person who loves serious, continuous plot, I don't find myself enjoying the series too much. This is not to say that it is not good. If you watch them maybe 2 episodes a day, it should be fairly enjoyable. If you are a fan for Sebastian... Well, good for you, you will love it. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, for the last 8 episodes, I did enjoy them. The story became serious and interesting. So, I felt it was a good series after I completed it, but during the time I watched it, I didn't. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nI can see why people loved it. The concept was simply unique and brilliant. But if you look at it in a critical point of view, it kinda... failed to be a respectable piece of entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I think everyone should watch it. After all the ending is great and for people don't mind episodic stories and easily get intrigued in the settings, this show is golden. For others, it is still worth a shot since it has a very unique concept and style comparing to the rest of the animes. \\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

            "content": "I genuinely loathe this anime, and it has little to do with the supposed yaoi overtones within it. Let's move on with this.\r\nNOTES NOTES: This is speaking ONLY for the anime. So don't click \"Not helpful\" because you've read through the manga and/or find horrible inconsistencies with canon past episode 6, which is where I dropped it.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nWell, it starts off nice, with a good dark theme going for it, what with all the demonic butlers and children dead set on revenge. And for a while, it was worthwhile. Then comes episode 6, the introduction of the Shinigami, where it steamrolls itself downward. At thispoint I dropped it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nWell, it's a decently animated bishounen wonderland. The coloring is pretty good, and the Victoriana theme is actually rolling along fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nThere wasn't really anything notable about it, so meh.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nI'm going to try to pack some very angry stuff in a lot of words, kthx. This is going to be pretty comprehensive, yet not very long for individuals.\\n\\n\r\nSebastian: Pretty okay concept turned into this retched Gary-Stu. He's too prefect in every thing ever, and wants this kid's soul. Oh and he's a demon.\\n\r\nCiel: Kinda an asshole kid hell-bent on revenge. He crossdresses or something and people like to ship him with his butler.\\n\r\nFinnian: Dumb unfunny attempt at comedic relief.\\n\r\nMaylene: Dumb unfunny klutz attempt at comedic relief.\\n\r\nBaldroy: Not really notable unfunny attempt at comedic relief.\\n\r\nTanaka: The normal, not funny/speshul butler who winds up being a failed attempt at comedic relief.\\n\r\nMadame Red/Angelina Durless: woah woah waoh a female who plays a role in the plot until she is killed, in the climax of the Jack the Ripper arc.\\n\r\nDamian: First episode and that's it. Nothing special other than he decides to attempt to con Ciel. And fails.\\n\r\nElizabeth Middleford: The moeblob. Oh, she winds up angering Ciel too, but Sebastian is all like \"I'M TOO COOL FOR YOUR RAEG, BUT I'LL MAKE IT BETTER\".\\n\r\nLau: The token Chinese mafioso. That's it pretty much.\\n\r\nAleister Chamber: He's a perv who attempts to sell a crossdressing Ciel. He's an uberbishounen.\\n\r\nUndertaker: A Shinigami, but that's only in the anime. He deals with dead bodies and whatnot and has a pretty high bishounen level.\\n\r\nLord Randall: He has sideburns. THAT IS PRETTY MUCH HIS PURPOSE\\n\r\nAzzurro Vanel: Like Lau, but without the chinese. He sells drugs too. Also, he winds up kidnapping! What fun this is, because it's basically the first arc!\\n\r\nRan-Mao: Lau's assistant. Just kinda hangs out for a while.\\n\r\nMary Jane Kelly: Could very well provoke FEMINIST RAEG with the things that happen to her.\\n\r\nWilliam Spears: A Shinigami, who's always frowning. He's a supervisor who winds up having to baby the next character...\\n\r\nGrell Sutcliff: Another Shinigami. Basically an insultingly campy gay with a chainsaw. If an anime could be ruined by one character, this would be it. He's pretty incompetent when he's first introduced, and continues to be. The only reason the fandom likes him, from what I can tell, is that he's gay and/or MTF. And that's a pretty stupid reason to love an annoyingly incompetent character. Oh, and he's got some definite Stu going on, because he screws the rules pretty hard while with Angelina. His voice actor makes it worse.\\n\r\nShinigami in general: Two words: Anachronism Stew.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, I really, really loathe this anime. The fandom does not help at all either. If you're into Victoriana themes and art, and have a callous disregard to plot and characterization, you're going to LOVE this. Otherwise, go watch something else. It's for your own good.",

            "content": "So, Kuroshitsuji is an anime that is labelled \u201cshounen\u201d but I don\u2019t really know why - it\u2019s filled with bishounens, pretty clothes and the fancy Victorian age backdrop with massive shounen ai and shota undertones. Oh, and the obvious gay shinigami who keeps trying to kiss the butler. \r\nThe story starts off with an eerie atmosphere, showing a 10 year old child who exchanges his soul for a demon butler to help exact his revenge against the people who killed his parents and humiliated him. Two-three years later they are still together; Ciel Phantomhive the 12 (later 13) year old Earl also the head ofhis house and company and Sebastian Michaelis, the demon butler who could do anything and together working for the Queen to solve mysteries and at the same time learning about Ciel\u2019s past. \\n\\n\r\nIt would have been a great story. If not for the amount of filler episodes that had been injected in due to the lack of material that had come out from the manga and the confusion in later episodes that still left me with many, many questions. \\n\\n\r\nThe first and second episodes were indeed spectacular. Instantly there is a dark and mysterious aura and it is well maintained throughout the entire series (except for the idiotic moments with the less than lovable extra staff at the Phantomhive household). Even up to episode 6 it was still good. However, after that it just started to get a little tiring with all the missions they have to carry out. Boring in fact. The second half of the series was entirely all filler; filler that wasn\u2019t even interesting and to put it plainly \u2013 all over the place. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned before, the anime does not follow the manga series exactly but the first half of the series does to an extent. The second half was written exclusively for the anime. Now this is where it goes horribly wrong. Most of the second half\u2019s story made absolutely NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. Take Sebastian\u2019s sudden disappearance for example. For someone who has made an unbreakable contract and who has already done about two years work for Ciel it was a unrealistic that he would leave Ciel. Moreover it was uncharacteristic of him. His personality wouldn\u2019t allow him to do such an act, even if it were to benefit Ciel in the end.  Plot twists came from nowhere, justifications and character motivations did not add up and I would end up sitting there by the end of the episode wondering what on earth has just happened.  Poor writing plagued the last three-quarters of the series, which is a real shame, considering how much I enjoyed the first six episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nWhen I first heard Sebastian\u2019s and Ciel\u2019s names I laughed. \u2018Sebastian\u2019 as the butler\u2019s name, that was so clich\u00e9 and Ciel \u2018Phantomhive\u2019 - now that didn\u2019t sound conspicuous at all did it? Well it certainly did humour me with these obvious names, but the characters themselves aren\u2019t ones that you can laugh at. Sebastian is seriously one badass butler, the anti hero of our story; he can do anything and I mean ANYTHING. After he SEDUCES A NUN to get information he certainly got my respect - the thought of him using such tactics was almost unthinkable (considering all the \"sexual tension\" between him and his master). And Ciel\u2026 well he is bratty. And he certainly does talk a lot of bull when it comes to why he is doing all this and such. What I liked about him though was how the producers practically used him as a doll to model fashion wear of the 19th century. \\n\\n\r\nBut these factors do not save them from being two dimensional characters. Sebastian can be thought as the anime parallel of Edward Cullen. Essentially a \u2018perfect\u2019 being with zero flaws, devilishly good looks (no pun intended) and abilities to do the impossible he contains no realism in him, more like a fantasy or ideal of \u2018the perfect man\u2019. But unlike the Twilight character mentioned there is an almost witty aspect to the butler, as each episode displays his tendency to be mischievous. In all honesty, though he is not much of a character for BEING the main character, he was still quite the fun person to watch as a viewer. Sadly, I cannot say the same for Ciel. As far as I\u2019m concern, he was there for the fanservice \u2013 from cross-dressing to wearing scantily clad clothes for a teenage English boy \u2013 mass producing shota fans as we speak. His reason for working for the Queen is neither explained nor in line with his prideful personality and his burning desire for revenge towards the people who \u2018humiliated\u2019 him is not emphasized or profound enough to take him seriously that he is truly a bitter, angry boy. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were very well done, both musically and animated-wise. Most anime usually does this thing where in the middle of the series they change the opening song and have a whole new animation to it. With Kuroshitsuji they keep the same song but switch around the verses used but have a whole new animation to it. The first ED uses an American song \"I'm Alive\" by Becca which would catch some off guard. The rock/pop song contrasts greatly with all the other themes uses but is a song that can be easily sung along to. It also is one of the most amusing endings ever with the animation that employs a chibi-styled art showing the day to day activities of Sebastian as a butler. The second ED song is a lot more melancholic to fit the serious second half of the story.  The background music is smoothly done and go fittingly well with the scene at hand. As an anime set in the high class 1800s, the production company rightfully uses dark gospel choruses to jazzy themes. \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation was very beautiful and fluid. Grand manors and clothing were all intricately designed and even in the few action scenes A-1 Pictures still had animation kept up \u2013 never letting choppy animation to ruin the flow. Everything is very gothic usually with night-settings, religion being brought in and of course, the clothes. Although Ciel did look very adorable in his attire, I felt like the clothes he was wearing were almost asking for him to be molested, which just made the paedophilia and gay overtones a lot more strong. \\n\\n\r\nThe most enjoyable part of this anime was the London/Victorian age setting. I was actually quite impressed with how well they displayed and used London and its history, like how they made Bethnal Green the base where all the drug dealers were from or the fact that there used to be fairs on the Thames during the winter when the water turned to ice. The producers did use the London card to the max - playing with different versions of \u201cLondon Bridge\u201d, using the Jack the Ripper character and displaying the fashion of the time. And of course since it\u2019s set in England there is some engrish, but the best one is Sebastian\u2019s \u201cYes, My Lord\u201d - makes me smile every time. The setting practically made this anime; I mean if you replaced the setting to a modern time, different place this anime would have immediately failed. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say it put the \u2018shit\u2019 in \u2018Kuroshitsuji\u2019 neither would I say this is a spectacular watch. This series was just \u2018okay\u2019 to me, it wasn\u2019t particularly special and it\u2019s quite tedious. I have had many unanswered questions formed in my mind and quite a few qualms about it. For those of you who actually read manga I suggest doing so first or instead of watching this since it just contains the main story and does not sell itself short with fan-pandering nonsense.  \\n\\n\r\nWill I be watching the second series? Well, yes for numerous reasons. I liked the manga enough to want to see it animated. I want to see if my questions will finally be answered. And most of all I want to find out WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED after the end of the last episode.",

            "content": "Holy flippin' A!!! Where to even begin with this anime?! There is so much here that I look for in an anime; I even added it to my favorites list before I was even done watching. It's got beautiful and THICK plot, hidden meanings, a GORGEOUS musical score, wonderful and zany characters, and enough emotional hitting power to make me keep a tissue box handy for those sad and happy tears.  This would be my first review to be an absolute 10 in score if there weren't just a few unanswered questions and assumed understanding after everything was said and done.  Even withthose there, though, this anime is one of the best things I've seen in a while, even better than Hikaru no Go which had be so wrapped up spring break. I'm sad to see it end 'cause I want more of this world, but, on the other hand, I'm glad it's got a definitive ending and isn't really leaving us cliff-hanging.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this show is something else. There's just so much depth, and it's so cerebral. I'll definitely have to do some re-watching to get all the little nuances and plot points down. I wouldn't recommend this show if you're just looking for some simple anime that would kill an afternoon. This is a thinking anime that touches on a ton of dark and deep issues. You'll also need to be paying close attention to all the plot twists! These little suckers come out of NOWHERE and twist the story into a completely different direction that one would expect. I was left gasping like fish more than once here.  For me, that's one of the best aspects of this story is those little plot twists. I never know what I'm going to see when watching something like this. Now that I've mentioned the good, let's talk about why I couldn't give this aspect a perfect 10. After watching the ending, I was left with some unanswered questions regarding some of the details here. While these details didn't sour the complete story for me (hence the 9), they might sour it for someone else. One detail that they didn't address did leave me a bit peeved, but my mind made a connection with another story aspect that I could guess was the answer. If everything had been addressed here, this would have been a DEFINITE perfect 10.\\n\\n\r\nART - 10\\n\\n\r\nA simple word here. BEAUTIFUL!!!! The animation flows so gorgeously in this anime. From the fight scenes to humorous antics to zany parties to heart-wrenching death scenes, absolutely everything here is flows so smoothly and sweetly. An aspect I noticed a lot in this anime was lighting. I don't see that a lot in anime and found it very appropriate for this title. If the characters were experiencing a dark and horrific scene, shadows and reds played big parts. If they were experiencing light-hearted birthday parties or servant antics, colors were bright, vibrant, and day-filled. Besides just the lighting, the art conveyed the atmosphere so much. It almost seemed to reflect character emotions and fates/destinies as well as set the mood for the anime. You will not be disappointed here! Just a slight warning, though, this anime doesn't shirk from blood. Not that it's gratuitous, every scene with it almost requires it and the blood adds to the atmosphere. But do be warned; I wouldn't let kids watch this.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 10\\n\\n\r\nThis is the crowning glory in my opinion. Every single piece of music adds to the atmosphere of this anime and leaves a person breathless. It's so haunting...... It's full of fast consistent beats for the fighting, chants and drones for the dark, plot-filled moments, sad female-filled melodies for the gut-wrenchingly sad parts, and a soft operatic finish for the final anime finale. There was use throughout the anime of a really fast beat chanting/droning thing used towards some combat and many plot-revealing scenes that I found particularly innovative and unusual. It added something really unique to an already beautiful track of music. The opening and ending themes fit the anime to a tee; the 2nd ending, Lacrimosa by Kalafina, especially fits the ominous ending the anime is barreling towards when this ending comes in. It's haunting, lyrical, and so emotion-filled. Just beautiful!! Besides the glorious musical score, this anime exhibits very good character voices. I especially loved Sebastian's dark and low voice. I could imagine my demon butler having that voice. *shiver* I can't think of any misplaced vocals at all. Everyone was distinct and complete unto themselves.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 9\\n\\n\r\nThere were so many hidden depths to most of these characters that absolutely no one seems two-dimensional. Everyone is fleshed out to some degree with emotional back stories and plot twists. Oh the plot twists!! There were a lot where it came to character development. I only wish that there had been equal attention to all characters. For some of them, the viewers were left wishing fervently for more. I personally wished the back stories of the servants at Phantomhive were fleshed out more. We are given some back hints in a few episodes and one episode almost completely devoted to the four of them, but not really a lot and I was curious! Oh well. The gradual building of Ciel's character and his relationship with Sebastian is more than enough to make up for it. There were some characters who I thought I had pegged when something radical happens and their intents and motivations turn in a completely different direction. Again, oh those plot twists!! Gotta love 'em!!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this title, unanswered questions and all. My mind can find connections between points where there may be no connection and so I can answer those questions in my own little mind. It was a beautiful and haunting ride that took me on an emotional rollercoaster and through a thorough mind-wringing. There was so much content here, from plot to wacky humor. I loved every bit of it. And the music!! Ack!! I'm going to be haunting ebay and the net in general looking for this OST ASAP!!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 10\\n\\n\r\nI think I pretty much summed it up in the enjoyment section. Everything just came together beautifully and created an anime that has made it to my favorites and re-watchable list. I absolutely adore it and wish there was more!!\\n",

            "content": "As of late, Kuroshitsuji is essentially the poster-boy for thinly-veiled fangirl bait. Kuroshitsuji (or Black Butler, whatever floats your boat) has tons of yaoi tropes, and has the word bishie plastered all over it, so you may think that being somebody who does not like these things, that I hate it because of that. So let's make this clear now: No. That has nothing to do with it. There are plenty of legitimate reasons not to like Kuroshitsuji besides that, so before you reach for the Not Helpful button, please think for a second: are you doing that because my review is badly written, orjust because you don't agree with my score? So, at the very least, just read the rest of the review first, OK?\\n\\n\r\nWith that sadly necessary disclaimer out of the way, let's discuss Kuroshitsuji. Kuroshitsuji is the story of a boy named Ciel Phantomhive, and his butler, Sebastian Michaelis. Ciel is the head of a toy company, and is also in the employment of the Queen, who enlists him to deal with various mysteries. Why this is the case isn't really explained, but nonetheless, most of the episodes play out as a Sherlock Holmes style detective series with him solving various supernatural mysteries.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Ciel is no ordinary boy... he has a contract with his butler for his soul. As you probably already knew, Sebastian is a demon of sorts. He is nigh invulnerable to everything, has amazing skill in pretty much every field, and is basically perfect in every way.\\n\\n\r\nThis, however, is the first problem with the series... Sebastian is a massive Gary Stu. He's simply too perfect. Not once do you feel for him as a character. He is completely overpowered, and is essentially an end all, fix all solution to more or less every single problem the series can throw at any of its characters.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the rest of the cast isn't much better. Ciel Phantomhive is probably the most likeable character in the show, being something of a snarky, deadpan character with a chip on his shoulder the size of Africa. But he has his idiosyncrasies as well... most of which simply come down to him being a complete jerk to everyone. Ciel is generally single-minded, only caring about whatever mission the Queen has given him, or getting revenge on those who ruined his life. The reaper, Grell Sutcliffe, had potential to be a loveable psychopath in the vein of Ladd Russo or any given Hellsing villain, but they eschew the chainsaw wielding, slasher smile route laid out in front of them in favour of making him incredibly, incredibly gay, as though they were trying to make a psychotic badass Leeron. But unlike the aforementioned Gurren Lagann character, they don't manage to make him nearly entertaining or tongue-in-cheek enough... to be perfectly honest, Grell is just plain offensive.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with Kuroshitsuji is that it can't seem to decide what it wants to be. For half the series, it goes down the aforementioned Sherlock Holmes route, painting a great depiction of 1888 London, rolling through themes like Jack The Ripper and Scotland Yard, but for the other half it tries to blend a Tim Burton-esque supernatural demon theme to the mix, and the tone of the series becomes very inconsistent as a result. Both styles are well-executed, but they conflict with each other. If they had been more consistent, Kuroshitsuji would have been better as a result. The character designs also mirror this quite heavily; While we often get a good, 1800s design like Sebastian, we also get overblown, colourful and vibrant designs like those of Grell or the Undertaker that creates a very poor contrast.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, there's something that can occasionally be very jarring, and that would be the anachronisms. Despite the show being set in 1888, you will frequently see things that are very out of place in this time period, like advanced modern handguns, sophisticated chainsaws, and film. While all of these things did exist in some form at this point, none of them do in the form they are shown in. And even more jarring is that most of these are applied to the Reapers, ancient beings that would not realistically incorporate these sorts of things into their supernatural array of weapons.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on that note, one of the things that annoys me most about Kuroshitsuji is that the demon lore is left completely unexplained, as though they were some sort of afterthought. The reapers hate demons, but why? It's never given any real mention. There are also Angels, only one of which we ever see, whose purpose and role in the demon lore is never even touched upon, let alone their motives. I think Kuroshitsuji would have actually been better if they had completely left out the angel/demon/reaper aspects of the show and solely focused on the detective angle instead.\\n\\n\r\nThe only aspect wherein Kuroshitsuji really shines is the production job. The animation is fluid, and the art style is thoroughly polished, using a blend of dark, rich tones. The 1800s environment is one of the strong points of the series, which makes it all the more of a shame that they so often opt for the Burton-shtick instead. The soundtrack is also very strong, featuring a variety of music fitted to the period, most notably the smooth jazz.\\n\\n\r\nNow, before this reads like an invitation for all the yaoi fangirls to break down my door, let me just clarify this by saying that Kuroshitsuji is not bad. What it is is average. Ordinary. Run of the mill. The only exceptional thing about it being the insane level of fan-pandering it stoops to.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is still one serious problem with Kuroshitsuji not accounted for... the ending. The last few episodes are an evermounting pile of contrived nonsense. Things happen, but no explanation as for why or how is ever really given. No character's motivations ever make sense. Plot twists come from absolutely nowhere with no foreshadowing or real explanation. It rivals Soul Eater in terms of ridiculous bullshit endings, but at least Soul Eater didn't leave us on an incredibly dodgy cliffhanger that leads to a second season of pure filler.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: It had potential, but it ignored it so it could pander to fans.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Graphics: 9/10\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 3/10\\n\r\nMusic/Background: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Hellsing, Pandora Hearts.",

            "content": "When it comes down to programmes that I enjoy but have a hard time defending, few can come anywhere close to the position that Kuroshitsuji has on my list. There really is a lot that I enjoy about the programme, but there's also a good deal of stuff about it that just gets under my skin. Considering the fact that this is a show that receives no shortage of praise and criticism, I feel that someone should try and give a semi-impartial review of the series and explain why they like it in the first place. With that said, let's get on with it.\r\nThe biggestreason as to why I enjoy Kuroshitsuji is the fact that it's a supernatural mystery drama. Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a supernatural programme that isn't action-oriented or comedy-centric? I've also got a soft spot for mystery drama and I also love the time period that the story takes place in. I've always had a thing for history and the rampant hypocrisy that went on during the Victorian period never ceases to capture my fancy. Furthermore, it's actually quite capable of keeping me hooked when it's giving me some involving plot. Of course, you can't really tell that it's a supernatural mystery drama that does all this stuff at first glance.\\n\\n\r\nThe most glaring problem that Kuroshitsuji has by far is the fact that A-1 Pictures does not know how to employ levity properly, which is most prevalent in the first 15 episodes. Furthermore, it opts for the worst kind of levity possible: chibi-style visual gags like the kind that Ultimate Spider-Man and Teen Titans use. Of course, I'd say that it's closer to Ultimate Spider-Man, given that all the levity ends up making it difficult to take the story seriously in the first place. Some people like to attribute this to the source material, but the manga itself is quite tame when referring to its usage of levity, but A-1 Pictures in their infinite wisdom decided to ruin a good thing. I understand that Kuroshitsuji is a shonen series by the end of it all, but is dark humour too sophisticated for a shonen audience? Come on...\\n\\n\r\nWhile we're on the subject, the second biggest problem that Kuroshitsuji has is the yaoi/shota subtext. Even though Yana Toboso  has written several yaoi mangas prior to writing Kuroshitsuji and that fact does reflect itself to a certain degree in the manga, any sort of yaoi/shota elements present in the source material were always intended to be used in a comedic context and weren't meant to be taken seriously in the slightest. Yes, you also have some official artwork of Ciel, Sebastian, et al but that shit don't contribute to the story so I ignore it! Unfortunately, A-1 Pictures in their infinite wisdom saw that there were a lot of Kuro fans who were into that shit and decided to dial up the yaoi/shota subtext between Ciel and Sebastian to an uncomfortably disturbing degree (it got to a point where I genuinely contemplated dropping the show). \\n\\n\r\nContrary to popular belief, Kuroshitsuji has a sizeable portion of its fanbase that *ISN'T* into slash in the slightest. I am a heterosexual male who absolutely despises paedophilia but I also happen to be an avid fan of the manga. Whilst the yaoi/shota moments that are present in the manga end up making me face-palm, they're short enough to the point where I can just look past them and pretend that it never happened. That's not the case at all when it comes down to the adaptation, since it felt like A-1 Pictures was playing this shit straight rather than for laughs. If I were to take a shot for every time there was a *serious* moment between Ciel and Sebastian which felt like A-1 Pictures was catering to the SebaCiel shippers, I'd probably succumb to cirrhosis. Okay, that's hyperbole but it's still a major problem that remains throughout the run of the programme.\\n\\n\r\nNow, another problem that Kuroshitsuji has when it comes down to the execution is the fact that it... gets... BORING. Seriously, this is supposed to be a supernatural mystery drama about a 13-year-old boy exacting revenge against those who've wronged him whilst losing everything precious to him in the process, right? Well, the first four episodes don't really paint this show to be like such. Instead, they just make this programme feel more like a slice-of-life comedy taking place in Victorian England. Okay, Episode 2 - \"His Butler, Strongest\" is kind of an exception but the point still stands. These episodes aren't bad by any means, but they certainly did get tedious for me. I just come into this show expecting serious plot, and I end up getting flawed storytelling. Well, it does get better but with a caveat attached to it.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike other popular shonen mangas such as One Piece which are published on a weekly basis, Kuroshitsuji is a monthly publication. As such, there was a limited amount of material to work with for the adaptation. Instead of giving this show a 1-cour run like it probably should've had from the get-go, A-1 Pictures decided to just fork the adaptation off from the source material after Episode 15 and then end on a completely different note. With that said, it should be noted that A-1 Pictures wasn't exactly the most faithful to the source material until that point and that there were many alterations present in what they did adapt.\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, the final nine episodes were where the show actually took itself seriously whilst dropping most of the shenanigans. Furthermore, the ideas and whatnot that they actually brought up were fairly interesting to say the least. Also, I have to give A-1 Pictures props for at least having the decency to end the show before it got too unnecessarily convoluted. I don't know about you, but I'd much rather have a show that has a solid conclusion rather than a show that spends week after week in a filler arc until it can resume adapting chapters. On the subject of the ending, it certainly wasn't a grand finale but at least I can safely say that it ended... you know, until Kuroshitsuji II came into the picture and shit all over that (among other things).\\n\\n\r\nOf course, if you think these episodes don't make any sense or suffer from some rather noticeable writing problems, I don't blame you. The biggest problem that these episodes have is the fact that they try to accomplish far too much in the time that it was given (in other words, they're pretty damn rushed). I mean, I wouldn't mind it if A-1 Pictures at least extended the runtime of this anime-original second half to 15-18 episodes so that things could run at a coherent pace, but I guess it's too late to change that now. Hindsight's a bitch, ain't it? Sure, the damage was done by the time that this show started taking itself seriously but hey! At least it got its shit together!\\n\\n\r\nFrom a characterisation standpoint, Kuroshitsuji is rather flawed. Whilst the manga has been publishing for roughly eight years and has 100+ chapters as of 25/12/14, the anime came out in 2008 when there were only 24-25 chapters available to adapt at that point in time. As such, Ciel and Sebastian (among others) remain the same throughout the bulk of the programme's run. This is quite unfortunate, as I quite like Ciel as a character and the manga does bring up some rather interesting questions about  him. Here, he's more or less a generic broody protagonist who needs to stop trying so hard to be like Bruce Wayne but with an eye patch.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my numerous complaints with Ciel's characterisation, I have almost no complaints about our butler to the core, Sebas-chan. Simply put, I absolutely adore Sebastian and I'll admit to having fangirled over him more than once (seriously though, who hasn't?!). I can't bring myself to hate him since he's got a charm similar to Alucard from Hellsing (in the sense that they're both badass servant characters). A lot of people like to give Sebas-chan crap since he's damn near infallible, but you know what? I don't really care. He's a DAEMON butler. He's not bound to the same rules that govern humanity, and it's not like he's without personality either. I just can't get enough of his quips and his snark. Plus, there's always something hypnotising about watching a butler killing goons with silverware whilst complaining that dinner will be late if he doesn't hurry up. Really, my only complaint is the fact that he remains static throughout the run of the programme but then again... he's kinda like that in the manga too.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the side characters like the other Phantomhive servants, Lizzie, Madame Red, Lau, Ran-Mao, and the like... they don't really get a lot of screen time outside of being comedic relief. Well, some characters like Madame Red and Lau end up getting their roles expanded as the series progresses but the fact that they were comedic relief for the bulk of their appearances kinda made it hard to take them seriously once their time to shine in the sun came. It really is a shame that A-1 Pictures didn't allow for more time to pass before adapting Kuroshitsuji because characters like Mey-Rin, Finni, Bard, Tanaka, and Lizzie actually ended up becoming favourites of mine later on in the manga's run. Well... I guess that doesn't stop Mey-Rin and Finni from being so adorable that it hurts, but I digress.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you get right down to it, A-1 Pictures might not be the best when it comes down to telling a story or giving us some good characters. But there's one area that they never cease to impress me with, and that's with their visual department. As much as I despise some of their OTHER works (*cough* Sword Art Online *cough*), there's no denying that each time A-1 Pictures works on a show, the visuals will be much better than what they previously worked on. That's seriously saying something, because the visuals here in the first season of Black Butler (which came out in 2008 no less) are absolutely gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really love about the art direction is the large amount of detail put into the backgrounds along with the colour palette. Unfortunately, the art direction and the animation don't really come into full bloom until Episode 16-onward when the show begins to take itself seriously. Everything before then is still really awesome stuff to look at, but the art/animation really shine whenever this show is taking itself seriously and is trying to feed us some involving plot. That really doesn't happen all that often in the first 15 episodes. With that said, the art/animation also shines whenever it drops the super serious, high-detailed stuff and goes into the less-detailed, comedy sketch stuff in a vein similar to Teen Titans. Whilst I'm not particularly fond of the comedic relief used in this show, at least I can say that the visual gags are well-animated and pretty to look at.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the animation on its own, well it's solid stuff. A good deal of the animation is limited to stills and talking heads but worry not for this is a drama show with some action thrown into the mix! The action sequences in this show are roughly similar to that of Wolf's Rain and Fullmetal Alchemist (2003): a lot of stuff happening in the foreground, not that much going on in the background. In fact, the high point of the action sequences are mostly going to be Sebastian stopping bullets before they leave the pistol along with Sebastian throwing silverware at random goons in the most epic ways possible. Of course, that's only fitting since Sebas-chan is one hell of a butler.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to note about the art/animation are the OP/EDs. You know how half-way through the season, the OP/ED change for no apparent reason in some shows, with new animation and a new song? Well the OP's animation changes at Episode 16, but they just use the second half of the OP song. Now, this isn't the first time I've seen an anime use the second half of a song for the OP (Trinity Blood did something similar), but this is the first time I've seen an anime use new animation for the second half of the song. It's the little things like this that make me smile. The 1st ED is shows a regular day in the life of Sebastian in chibi form while the 2nd ED is mostly stills of Ciel and Sebastian set over a more sombre tune. I'm more fond of the 1st ED, but the 2nd ED actually fits the show becoming more serious toward the end of its run and the song doesn't conflict horribly with any dramatic moments! I give props for that.\\n\\n\r\nArt/animation ain't the only thing that Kuroshitsuji has down because the OST for Black Butler across both seasons and Book of Circus is some downright amazing stuff. It fits in amazingly well with the time period that this show takes place in, with most of the BGM being stuff like slow jazz tracks and baroque violin/cello stuff you'd hear at a ballroom. What's more interesting is the fact that there's also quite a few super serious/ominous tracks that would play whenever Ciel and Sebastian are having a moment, my personal favourite being \"Si Deus Me Relinquit\" (Latin for \"If God Has Forsaken Me\"). I'd like to explain what it sounds like, but you should do yourself a favour and listen to it. The OP track, \"Monochrome Kiss\" by SID along with both ED tracks are highly addictive to listen to as well. Fun fact: the first ED track, \"I'm Alive\" by Becca is actually an American rock song, if I'm not mistaken.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the English dub, well... I've got rather mixed feelings about it. You see, unlike the Hellsing/Hellsing Ultimate dubs where actual people of British descent were hired to do the voice acting... the dub just uses American actors like Brina Palencia, J. Michael Tatum, Monica Rial, etc. and has them do their own take on a British accent. Now, Brina Palencia and J. Michael Tatum as Ciel and Sebastian respectively do an excellent job with the roles they've been given. You can still tell that they're faking an accent, but at least they're trying. Everyone else... not so much. The biggest problem I have with the dub is that some characters just speak normally but with the accent and others like the Phantomhive servants have Cockney accents which I find rather irritating. Monica Rial's work as Mey-Rin especially irritates me, but the Japanese VA is like that in the original I can't hold TOO much against her.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that I take umbrage with is the fact that there are two... Indian characters in the show, and yet they're not voiced by amateur Indian VAs with a proper understanding of the English language. Funimation just had Christopher Ayres and Patrick Seitz go about their lines but with horribly exaggerated Indian accents. Why do I take umbrage with this? Well... fun fact about me: I'm Punjabi, and Punjab is a part of India! One of the things that I hate is whenever there's an Indian character on-screen, and they have a horribly exaggerated accent. Seriously, would it kill Funimation to just hire Salman Khan and Amitabh Bachchan to just do the voice acting for these two characters?\\n\\n\r\nNow, it's not like the dub is complete shit because that's far from the truth The ADR crew also did a great job of making sure the dialogue fit the mouth movements while making sure that the actors/actresses gave a good performance. I'm also guessing that the accents were used as a way of giving *some* semblance of authenticity. At the same time, I just die a little inside every time I hear Christopher Ayres, Patrick Seitz, or Monica Rial give their take on a horrible accent imitation. If anything, this dub is similar to the Kanon (2006) dub: the dub itself is solid stuff, but there's just that tiny little detail that just makes me want to make myself taller.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that baggage out of the way, let's wrap this up. Black Butler on the whole is just \"good.\" It's not a masterpiece like some of the overzealous fans like to claim it is, but it's also not shit like some of the others on here would like for you to believe. Now, reviews on the whole are a very subjective thing so obviously there's going to be a lot of areas that people disagree on. But at the same time, there are shows on the market that are a hell of a lot more painful to watch than this. If you want shit, don't turn to Kuroshitsuji. Turn to Sword Art Online. Just watch the first episode of Black Butler if you've got 20 minutes to spare. If you like what you see, keep going. If you don't, drop it altogether. It's just that simple. Alternatively, you can just watch the first 15 episodes and then move over to the infinitely superior Kuroshitsuji: Book of Circus. That works too. I also highly recommend reading the manga, as it's one hell of a good read.",

            "content": "So after some trial, tribulation, and mulling it over in my brain, I finally finished this show but wasn't fully sure what to think of it. Black Butler is a confusing show that I personally think has some pretty major identity issues going on. It's overall not that bad for a semi-shonen type show. The setting of Victorian England adds a unique setting and at times I found the supernatural element that gets added to the show enjoyably reminiscent to horror books I've read from the Gothic Victorian era such as Dracula and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Black Butler isbasically role-reversed Batman where Bruce Wayne's parents die and he turns into a bitter rich kid in short shorts who conducts all the business while Sebastian is more like Alfred if he could do all the stuff Batman does. And given the fangirl reaction to Bassie I'd say he fits the playboy role pretty well too. For the most part, the plot really plods about and throws it's identity confused weight around, but at least it looks cool while doing it. Sebastian is a great character; he's a gentleman loved by the ladies with cool demon powers. Granted it's a cop out that he's omnipotent thus never putting Ciel in a position of real danger but that's beside the point. Like Berserk, Sebastian is his Egg of the King, and when he's around, the tension of his struggle loses weight because he's no longer in any danger. However I think the show is given a great premise but doesn't do a lot with it, and when I finished it the entire experience felt like something of a rough draft of something brilliant rather than a complete show. The primary factor that goes along with that was the inconsistency of everything and it tends to jump around a little too much. Sometimes it wants to be really serious and then it'll throw something \"funny\" in, thus ruining the joke AND the serious tone and you're back to square 1. Sometimes it wants to be a supernatural detective story but goes too heavy on the supernatural element by throwing around the term \"soul reaper\" and \"death scythe\"  like it was trying to be Bleach, Soul Eater, and Dracula. I mean the guy who is the lead grim reaper is the same voice actor who plays Death himself in the dub of Soul Eater for God's sake. Sometimes it wants to give you an in depth experience into Ciel's mind and how he's feeling, and it never fully develops it. In addition to the inconsistency I was also really bothered by the stuff that was never really developed like Ciel's relationships with everyone, and the fact that there's never really a developed or clear cut villian or antagonist fighting against him (or if they are they're hastily thrown together). So despite the cool premise I'm gonna have to give Black Butler a passable rating. But if you're into more style-over substance shows and interesting Gothic settings, Black Butler is right up your dark London alley.",

            "content": "A butler is commonly defined as a male servant who takes charge of providing service to his master and keeping everything proper and organized in the household. Yana Toboso presents a devious twist to the meaning of a Butler, giving the audience on hell of a good show. Excuse the pun.\r\n~[S T O R Y]~ [9]\r\nViewers have seen it all: servants and masters working as partners in crime, so to speak. The master is devious, and the servant is obedient in general Japanimation. We've seen older men be served by seniors or young children. Yet there is a sense of originality captured in Kuroshitsuji. Neverbefore have we ever seen not only a professional and sophisticated demon butler, but a butler that can definitely outshine the common traits of a servant. Kuroshitsuji displays a series of mysteries inside and outside the Phantomhive household, spurring great thought into the audience as to who is involved, what is going on, and of course: WHY. Not only that, but Toboso knocks us out with twists never to be expected. There are dark themes weaved into the plot, but Toboso attempts to calm us down by providing us a nice handful of humour in between episodes - especially the antics of Finny, Meilin, Bard, and our little old tea-drinking butler Tanaka whom Sebastian respects surprisingly so. Although the series is still running anime and manga-wise, the plot gradually grows stronger along with our mental and visual appetite for knowing more on the backgrounds of Ciel Phantomhive and Sebastian Michaelis. \\n\\n\r\n~[A R T]~ [9]\\n\r\nLondon during the Victorian era is where Kuroshitsuji is set. The art is done well enough for the viewer to realize that it is during the nineteenth century London without being informed of its setting. The artists aside from Toboso who have designed the characters and sets have presented a nice taste to the Victorian era, such as the historical city streets, the enchanting landscape of Phantomhive manor, and the eerie scenes of reveries and places where Ciel and his team are compelled to go - such as cemeteries, haunting passageways and of course the base where our beloved Undertaker resides. The opening animation theme gives us a sense of experimental art: consisting of a sense of grunge followed by dark, elegant art that is weaved into the story's style. The reason why I had not marked the art category a 10 is due to the ending animation theme. The cute scrolling cartoon that separates itself from the general art of the anime leaves the audience wondering whether they are attempting to add random humour to the end or not. Were the ending to be just as beautiful as the beginning theme along with the rest of the animation in the series, the art would've recieved a perfect score.\\n\\n\r\n~[S O U N D]~ [9]\\n\r\nNormally in an anime such as Kuroshitsuji, one would expect the musical scores to consist of classical music and gregorian chants. Nonetheless, the series goes slightly beyond the music that would stereotypically match the setting where the anime takes place. The classical music and gregorian chants capture the essence of a dark, dramatic anime. The rock music flowing at the ending theme of the show gives the anime a connection to a modern age of rock and roll. The lyrics to the beginning and ending themes match the anime almost close enough, as though the musical artists created their songs just for the show's sake. The background music in random scenes gives us a sense of what to expect: epiphanies, a comedic episode, dark and nostalgic reminiscence, et cetera. Yet the music is not too obvious. The sounds are not cheesy unlike other animes set around the nineteenth century. They relax us emotionally yet drive our minds wild out of raging curiousity.\\n\\n\r\n~[C H A R A C T E R]~ [9]\\n\r\nDaisuke Ono gives Sebastian Michaelis his signature smooth, demonic voice that no other seiyuu could ever match. Sebastian is the pure personification of a demon butler, what with his eloquent nature and satirical humour. Demons are often looked upon as ravenous creatures who are hideous inside and out. Yet Sebastian gives a whole new definition to the name of a demon. He is the subject of pure sin, provoking all seven of the sins [more in the manga than the anime] to humans or even observing them in the human world. He does not give into temptation and turns into an angel like other stereotypical animes. He keeps up his sinful guard, making the anime a more interesting watch. He is mysterious, smooth, and attractive enough to make him appear more like a talented, demonic angel than a regular demon in disguise. Moreover, Ciel Phantomhive is not your typical 12 year old. The murder of his parents followed by the destruction of his home and childhood brought forth a dramatic transition no one would ever expect of the boy. He is more mature than his age, seeing as he is the proud owner of a toy company along with playing his role as the Queen's underdog. Together, the two make a fantastic, brilliant team that leaves no stone unturned and no mystery left folded. The other characters seem slightly minor earlier in the series. But as time progresses, their ranks incline and make us wonder more about them. How did Finny become so strong? What dwells in the mind of Elizabeth Middleford? How is Tanaka able to change heights from a short old man to a tall sophisticate? Ignorance definitely is bliss when watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\n~[E N J O Y M E N T  &amp;  O V E R A L L]~ [9]\\n\r\nOverall, the series is worth enjoying. The anime is yet to be complete, and the manga seems far from over. We are filled with a sensational tension to know the answers behind the questions, know the solutions to the mystery, and understand how our world and the world in the Victorian era are not that different. Both worlds share their moments of profound mystery, moments of drama and laughter, moments of sin versus virtue... I am definitely looking forward to what other tricks Yana Toboso has left up the sleeve. And if you were an individual who prefers tricks and treats, then allow the black butler to serve you. :]",

Let me apologise beforehand for such an obnoxiously long review. So let's go.\r\nIf there is one sentence that could perfectly describe this series it would be: \"What an utter waste of potential!\"\r\nThe premise is a boy selling his soul to a demon and then solving mysteries related to the underground society in Victorian-era London. What an epic anime it could have been; a mix of Death Note, Hellsing and Sherlock Holmes- a guarantee of success. But it became the school example of wasting potential instead. Some series just don't have the premise that could make them good. But this - man I was disappointed! \\n\\n\r\nThe manga had several aspects that disappointed me, but there were other, redeeming points, and while it wasn't a masterpiece I hoped it would be, it was a decent story to pass time with. The anime on the other hand...\\n\\n\r\nPLOT: 3\\n\r\nThe fact that manga was ongoing and provided little material to work with is no excuse. There were enough chapters to make some 10-12 episodes. Instead, they stuck to the manga for the first 6 episodes and then dropped it. The first 3 episodes served as an introduction of the main cast of characters and featured little plot. Episodes 4,5 and 6 were \"Jack the Ripper Arc\". Speaking strictly about the plot, it was relatively good so far. Even episode 7 was promising - everything looked and smelled like The Hound of the Baskervilles. But beginning with ep 8, it was all over. The series featured a large number of \"arcs\", very loosely connected, and a number of filler episodes between them.\\n\r\nThe basic ideas of the arcs were not bad, but they were horribly executed, too fast-paced ( most of them just 2 ep long ) and ended up making little if no sense whatsoever. The plot holes were not a major issue because the plot itself was just too incoherent. There were way too many facepalm and \"WTF?\" moments to enjoy anything and I ended up wondering if they were scr*wing the plot and basic ideas on purpose. 3 for the Jack the Ripper Arc.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 7\\n\r\nOne of the main problems of this series is inconsistency. It can't decide whether it wants to be Holmes-like, or angsty, or action series, or supernatural, or just yaoi/ bishounen fanservice for the peanut-brained 13-14 year-old girls. It unsuccessfully tries to be all at once, with the latest category ( fanservice ) prevailing. The animation follows the pattern. At times it's brilliantly depicted 19th century London, very dark and realistic. Then it's less realistic with modern hand guns and cars, thus spoiling the spirit and atmosphere of Victorian era. And then... we have domiantrix outfits, Italian mafia in modern suits, Gothic lolita and Steampunk fashion and very non-Victorian behaviour. It won't bother some, but if you're going with historical setting, then make it convincing, please. Some scenes are well animated and coloured and the visual effects flow well. But then they go with the cheap chibi animation and very bright colours. Pick one! The only bits of series that I find flawlessly animated are the first opening theme and the second ending theme. Nothing particularly special or stunning, but they are well-balanced and go well with the music.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7.5\\n\r\nThe soundtrack itself is pretty good, one of the highlights of the show, but it's too quiet for the most of the series. The opening and ending theme songs are well-chosen, especially \"Lacrimosa\", my personal favourite. I like how they use Latin songs and combination of classical and electric instruments. The jazz tunes caught me off guard a bit, but they are actually quite good and give the soundtrack a distinctive level. If only the other aspects of the series were developed as good as the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:  3.3\\n\r\nCiel Phantomhive - In the manga, a well developed character, mixture of Artemis Fowl and Near from Death Note with a strong touch of evilness. Albeit suffering a terrible fate, he stays strong and becomes more ruthless and evil as the story progresses. A spoiled brat, but I like him both as a character and as a person ( there are many similarities between him and I ). In the anime, he's an angsty, two-dimensional character, whose motivations are unclear. Apart from being \"out-of-character\", his actions are very inconsistent and you can clearly see that the manga Ciel and anime Ciel are two different people. Shota and bishouned tones exponentially multiplied in the anime.\\n\r\nSebastian Michaelis - First of all, I should point out that Sebastian isn't and cannot possibly be a Gary Stue, simply because he's not human. Yes, he's almighty and perfect, but he's a demon. What good would a demon be if he can't beat up your enemies and make you some fine tea? The bad thing about this aspect of Sebastian is that it backfires when it comes to the plot. In combination with helpless Ciel and incompetent plot-makers, Sebastian becomes \"deus ex machina\", the solution to every problem and every situation. His wittiness and teasing of his master vanish with ep7 and he shows some serious OOC-ness in the final episodes, when he ABANDONS CIEL ( against the unbreakable contract he's made with him ). In the end, he's nothing but a sex object for the fangirls to fangirl over ( and my only comment to his \"special\" relationship with Ciel is: paedophilia is not sexy/cute! \\n\r\nGrell Sutcliff - The potential for the badest psycho badass of all time. Had they made him female and more psychotic, Grell could have rivaled Alucard. Instead, we got the overly gay Reaper who likes to wear short shorts. God...\\n\r\nMost of the canon characters are, apart from Madam Red, given no or little ( good ) exposition and don't do much to make the plot going. The only exception is Fred Abberline, who's role in the series is far greater than in the manga.\\n\r\nAll non-canon characters are piss-poor and cheap, not to mention badly designed.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL IMPRESSION: 5\\n\r\nRuining the premise with the awful plot was bad enough, but the amount of fanservice destroyed it beyond repair. Although I detest yaoi and similar perversions, maybe I could have survived it. But the inconsistency of the quality of animation, mixing of so many genres, the horrible plot, the bad characters... it was too much. I watched it through to the end simply because I dislike not finishing thing that I've started. And I wanted to have all the knowledge of the crap I'm reviewing. So here's my final mark. After viewing the anime I started to appreciate the manga more. To conclude this I'll say again: what a waste.\\n",

            "content": "If this was a one-line review, it would be \"A great premise but sadly a bad execution.\" This anime struggles to find a balance between it's serious overarching story and the less serious comedy of it, a comedy that's often immature and just plain unfunny. Around every turn the anime is clearly struggling between being serious and being immature, resulting in a weird mix of the two that's just not appealing at all. \r\nThe overarching story has amazing potential, when I read the premise I thought that this might be the not-so-famous cousin of Code Geass, but I was sorely disappointed. While the overall premiseof Kuroshitsuji looks great on paper, the execution is clearly lacking. \\n\\n\r\nThe overarching story of Kuroshitsuji is quite serious and you'll notice that early on, in the first few episodes even. But, as the anime moves on you begin to notice that the other things added together to make the complete story aren't so serious at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe comic 'relief' that this anime likes so much quickly becomes so abundant that the serious bits instead become the relief. Unlike in Baccano, where the comic relief was memorable and well executed, the comic 'relief' in Kuroshitsuji is too much, too often, and most of the time it's not comedy but instead just plain immature and silly. \\n\\n\r\nWhile these characters are out of place in this anime, the two main characters of the anime are very enjoyable. Ciel Phantomhive doesn't really have a particularly interesting or great backstory to him but that doesn't matter because he's well executed. His butler, who also is a main character, is great as well. It was enjoyable seeing their stories unravel between the immaturity of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that, there's not much to be said of the story and characters aside of the yaoi undertones. This is another silly and immature part of the anime. I don't mind so much the yaoi undertones between the the butler and his master, because they are just that, undertones, but when we get a naked dog-man jumping around and licking people then it gets a bit too much. And, of course the female cast is there every step to bleed their brains out of their noses as soon as something even remotely homoerotic takes place. \\n\\n\r\nThe animations aren't deserving of any praise either. While they aren't bad they certainly aren't good either. I'm not an animation buff but I clearly noticed how the animators had problems with consistency when it came to the size of people and objects. Another thing was the fact that perspective seemed to be skewed every now and then. The animations aren't so bad as to make you jump up and yell, but if you're remotely interested in good animation this anime will leave you with a somewhat bad taste lingering in your mouth. Again, it's not that bad and if the other aspects of the anime seems to appeal to you the animations certainly shouldn't drive you away, they're not that bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is again not something that I can say I noticed too much of either way. There wasn't anything either good or bad enough to make me notice it. Maybe this is just a failure on my part as a viewer and listener, but I didn't notice anything too good or too bad about the sound. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the sole redeeming quality of this anime is the interaction between Ciel Phantomhive and his butler. The serious overarching story is directly countered by the amount of silly and immature comedy you're served each and every episode. It takes a massively long time for the anime to actually get to the main story, and I had more than one moment where I sat and wondered when on earth they were going to get on with it. The anime is also clearly struggling with finding its place between being a serious drama and being a silly comedy. There are very serious things going on in here, there's even an implied sex-scene that's handled with some degree of maturity until one of the comic relief cast decide to bleed all over the walls with her nose. I guess that's what plaguing this anime, the somewhat serious story that's constantly being countered by a massive amount of silly comedy. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I don't think this will be a very enjoyable anime for anyone. If you're looking for a somewhat serious anime you're not looking for it in the right place. On the other hand, if you're just looking for something to laugh at this clearly isn't it either. I laughed while watching this anime, but it wasn't because it was fun, it was because it was immature and cringeworthy.",

            "content": "This anime is one of the most breathtaking, gloriously beautiful masterpieces that I have ever seen. It manages to mix in character development, humour and action at the same time. They are all well balanced, so there isn't too much of comedy and such. Though it may not look like it, Kuroshitsuji is a dark series and thus there are lots of thought provoking themes and symbolism. The series is such that you could be crying with either happiness or sadness with the character. To be frank the show had me crying at times I thought I wouldn't. Though there are some questions left unansweredat the end, it is still worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nStory [9]\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the storyline was unique in its own way. The beginning arc is by far one of the best I've seen. But after it strayed away from the manga, it got a bit floppy around the middle, leaving some unanswered questions and vague hints. The series could definitely maximise its potential if not for the somewhat weaker storyline in the middle. But of course, this is merely my opinion.  Don't worry, though it went in a different direction than the manga, the ending is not like soul eater's *cough* The ending was AMAZING, there hasn't been any other ending that made me emotional and depressed for a few days other than FMA, CG and GoTF. If not for the loose ends, it would have been a 10 for sure.\\n\\n\r\nArt [10]\\n\\n\r\nThe art is one of the drawing points that led me to watch this series. Sebastian and Ciel's designs are beautiful, and there are hardly any scenes in the anime that makes the characters look weird. 19th Century London was also amazingly done, and it feels like I could have been there. The outfits and also the ambience was equally well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound [10]\\n\\n\r\nWow. The soundtrack of Kuroshitsuji is I can confidently say, the BEST I have ever heard. The OST doesn't comprise of pointless yelling and electric guitars. It takes a more .. classical and latin like hymns approach, can't exactly describe it. There are many beautiful melodies that will make you take notice of it immediately. For me, I was so transfixed by the music at the end of episode 3 that I missed out what was being said and had to replay. The songs play a vital role in the emotional impact on the audience. The end of the final episode, especially, wouldn't have so much of an impact if played without sound. The ED 2 , Lacrimosa is so hauntingly beautiful. Matches the dark gothic theme perfectly. The seiyuus were all also extremely good, portraying the characters the way they are supposed to be! The best to me was of course Sebastian. His low voice just makes you melt.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10]\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is amazing. You can see the difference from the beginning and toward the end of the show. Their emotional dilemmas are not portayed as an obstruction, but as a way to help the characters grow. Madame Red in particular is the character that I was riveted upon. The way her character came to be, and how it ended.. Just speechless. Ciel is also the same. But no spoilers here!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment + Overall [10]\\n\\n\r\nEverything falls into place perfectly, making this anime an amazing artwork, especially with its design and soundtrack. God the ED 2 is still stuck in my head even now, it's just so hauntingly beautiful. Though I was skeptical about this anime initially, I'm glad I picked it up. What are you waiting for? Watch it NOW",

            "content": "The real crux of why this anime fails to have any impact is the characters. Not a single one is capable of pulling off the swagger they purport to have, summed up by the incredibly terrible \"catch phrase\" of the butler being \"one hell of a Butler,\" which is always said so apathetically that it makes it even more boring. The main shota-boy is the worst of all, as Ceil manages to pull off nothing at all. Ceil is constantly bratty without being really grating or especially irate because all he likes to do is complain. The series plays up his parents' death making himungodly fixated on revenge, but even that passion is never actually displayed in the series. Another good example of a purely character related flaw is how much time people spend blushing over Sebastian, each time being groan worthy.\\n\\n\r\nNow, of course, the anime had to have some reason I kept watching (even though I was playing Ocarina of Time the whole time), and that was because the plot did have a decent trajectory. It was interesting to see them play out the demons' existence and purpose and Ceil's quest, although it was of course bogged down repeatedly by things like the aforementioned lack of passion and the fact that when it did choose to finally fixate on characters, they were often horrible.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the characters are drawn is horrible, but the way the rest of this is drawn is great. I could mostly ignore the characters and look at the otherwise pretty art though (except when it was terribly chibified or the like).\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is thoroughly mediocre while the music is pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was not enjoyable, really, but was not godawful at the same time, as contradictory as that might seem. I still would never recommend anyone to watch this with so many series that actually achieve being \"epic,\" not merely pretending like this one does.",

That's not me, but it explains the rating of this series to some extent. If that's what you want, you might like this show.\r\nThe plot and characters also bother me. The main character is all style and no substance. On the other hand, if you want towatch a cartoon kid pretend to be brilliant and important while doing nothing but look fancy in expensive cartoon clothes while his butler does all the work, this might be the show for you. The butler is also shallow. He has unspecified powers with no apparent limits, and no real personality. The plot also only pretends to have any depth whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is fine, though not great. Animation is OK for most parts, but the 3d things look bad and the action scenes are terrible.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this series is strictly inferior to Chevalier d'eon and El Hazard the Magnificent World for any kind of person I can think of, and not worth watching if you don't like crossdressing guys and/or yaoi.\\n",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji or black butler was one hell of an anime. the mix of mythical creatures such as shinigamis, demons, angels with the Britain history is well done. The story is based on some historical facts but of course 99% of the serie is fictive. One great example of a historical fact that they used is Jack The Ripper. The way that they explain those cases with those mythical creatures, is just as it could\u2019ve happened in history without that anyone would\u2019ve noticed it. So basicly they use those creatures to let those cases make a lot more sense.\r\nCiel Phantomhive is however he is still achild the head of the Phantomhive house/company that does all kind of underground work for the queen. The fact why he is the head of the corporation is because his mansion was fired and both his parents died because of that. After that full of despair and seeking for revenge he made a deal with a demon. The demon may eat his soul when he got his revenge. After they made the deal the demon becomes his butler, able to do the most impossible things and doing/accomplishing everything he has been ordered to. When people has something as \u201cwhat the fuck?!?!\u201d when they saw what he did/can do. He always simply respond \u201cthat it is only normal for a servant of the Phantomhive family to be able to do such things\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nIn this serie you see the not official power of the queen and a lot of british culture from the end of the 19th century. However his mansion is in Scotland he usually travels a lot to solve the problems of the queen where he becomes confrontated with some people he wants revenge on.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion it is one of the classic animes that you should\u2019ve watched if you are a anime fan. However there are some reasons why it doesn\u2019t deserve a high point in my opinion. First of all there are a lot of fillers, things as episode 1 and other episodes are not bad but it doesn\u2019t gives something extra at the story. I think they should\u2019ve been ova. Second I don\u2019t think they have completely used the potential it had. you\u2019re probably asking yourself now \u201cwhy do I need to watch it then?\u201d. Well the biggest reason for me are the characters. Ciel and Sebastian (the butler) are super good and original characters that you won\u2019t find in just any anime. Another great thing about it is how good some episodes are. Episodes such as episode 6,.. and the end also made the serie. It is very weird but after a bunch of fillers there is randomly a super episode that has the feeling of a wonderful end. Everybody probably knows the feeling of a unbelievable end well here they are randomly placed in the serie as well.\\n\\n\r\nFor the rest the music fits the story perfectly, it basically is dark church music for the butler and other dark moments and kinda jazz for the normal moments, with this used in the right way it gives the extra right touch it needed. The drawings are nothing special but surely not bad. The most amusing moments for me where when the butler follows his orders, that just keeps surprising me. The characters aren\u2019t bad but nothing special however as I said, Ciel and Sebastian are just superb in every way.\\n",

            "content": "This one was&hellip; interesting. I was originally going to avoid it because of the pedophile vibes that I was given. A show about a young boy and his creepy butler just sounded wrong&hellip; However, I decided to watch it, and grabbed the subbed version from Shinsen&hellip; The OP was pretty good&hellip; there are certainly better, but there are many worse ones this season. The ED doesn&rsquo;t have a good song, but the mountains of chibi awesome-ness make up for it. The art is very nice, all the backgrounds are hand painted, and the character art is decently consistent. The CG (what little they use) tendsto be a bit dodgy in spots, but I think that can be overlooked. The story of this anime focuses on Ciel Phantomhive, the orphaned heir to the Phantomhive estate. How his parents died hasn&rsquo;t been established yet, but it apparently caused him to make a contract with a demon&hellip; who is his butler. Let me say here, that Sebastian (insert Lucky * Star reference here) is the single most badass butler ever. Watch the show for yourself if you don&rsquo;t believe me. I&rsquo;m going to have a hard time summarizing the first episode, but I can say some other things. The atmosphere is very good at shifting. It can be comical and ridiculous the first moment, but then be pants-wettingly creepy. Not many anime these days can switch back and forth so well. Ciel comes off as pretty creepy as small boys with eyepatches come. The rest of the house staff is comical, complete with the girl who loves Sebastian. Sebastian is honestly the best of the whole character set. He switches back and forth from comical to creepy along with the rest of the show. He has red eyes, pallid white skin, and dark hair (as well as an angular face, which makes him remind me of the black swordsman from Comedy.) From what I can tell, he is a demon, but I can only tell from the vague description I can get from the show. He says &ldquo;I am but a butler,&rdquo; but the way he says it, it can be also translated as &ldquo;I am but a demon.&rdquo; Anyway, Sebastian is obviously the most badass demon butler to ever grace the screen. I really don&rsquo;t have much more to say on this, because I have no plot summary. Watch it if you want, you will probably enjoy it. I enjoyed it enough to bring me to the second episode, providing Shinsen gets the subs out with decent speed. It really isn&rsquo;t half bad, and it was a lot better than I expected it. To sum it up, less pedophiliac, more ridiculous, and certainly more entertaining then I expected it to be. Check it out if you want to. I give it a total score 0f 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nProduction by A-1 Pictures. Airs on Thursday. Subs done by Shinsen.\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review and I choose to write it about the anime \"Kuroshitsuji\" Or \"Black Butler\". So let's get on with it, yes?\r\n~STORY & CHARACTERS~ Both rating 8/10\r\nThe story itself was overall enjoyable, though it's not something \"completely\" unheard of before. The anime \"Chrono Crusade\" has a slightly similar plot. I think what makes Kuroshitsuji different was the characters. To me the characters were mostly all lovable, even Ciel was, though at times he was an annoying little brat. But that was part of his charm ^^;; I absolutely LOVED Sebastian. I mean, there's literally nothing he can't do xD. And he's alwaysso cool and calm about it :P \\n\\n\r\n~ART~ Rating 9/10\\n\r\nI loved the art. I think I loved the outfits the most due the old Victorian era feel to them. Especially Ciel, Elizabeth and Sebastian were always very well dressed. The character design was nice and simple, but elegant enough to fit the context of late 19th century London. THOUGH, sometimes the men, namely for example Ciel, Finny and Ash, were drawn a little too feminine for my taste and I think that's why I gave the art only a 9 and not a 10. The scenery was beautiful and well done, which I appreciate very much in any anime ^^\\n\\n\r\n~SOUND~ Rating 10/10\\n\r\nAll of the chosen theme songs fit the series quite well. I liked the ending songs the most, especially \"Lacrimosa\" by Kalafina. I thought it was very befitting of Kuroshitsuji: the darkish and mysterious feel without being downright emo. Also the voice acting was great. Every character had the \"right\" voice, as in the one that suited them the most in my opinion. I was extremely glad that Ciel didn't have the typical \"little boy\" girly voice, because it would probably made me enjoy his character a lot less ^^;;. The sound effects and others were all great as well.\\n\\n\r\n~ENJOYMENT~ Rating 10/10\\n\r\nHell yeah I enjoyed it :D. It's very hard for me to come by an anime I truly enjoy (Yes I'm picky =__=\") And I had my doubts about Kuroshitsuji at first. But I definitely don't regret watching it. It made me laugh (a lot), it frustrated me (^^;), it even made me cry (can't say why :X) and that, to me, proves it's a good anime. Plus all of the things I mentioned above. It's most definitely worth watching. \\n\\n\r\n~OVERALL~ Rating 9/10\\n\r\nAbsolutely a \"must-watch\". Period. :P Everything coordinates so well, no matter how odd some things and/or characters are.  \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "To be completely honest, this show sort of pisses me off. \r\nThe main problem I have with this show is the two main characters. Let's start out with Ciel. He sold his soul to a demon, which is bad enough, but it wasn't even to save a life, it was to get revenge. I can never look past it. I hated him from the first scene I saw him. Thankfully, this show is not stupid enough to frame the decision as a good one, or Ciel as a good person. But it's hard to ignore the center of the plot. \r\nThen there is Sebastian. Igrew to dislike him more and more as the show went on. I know the ladies love him, but that smile is something that makes me want to gag. The catchphrase \"one hell of a butler\", which is actually pretty cool, gets ruined with incessant repetition. I don't find him charming.\\n\r\nThe story is pretty clever, the rest of the characters are good, the art is great, and the show in general is pretty funny, but the two main characters are big things to get wrong.\\n\r\nBut the thing that pisses me off the most about this show is that I couldn't stop watching. I have serious problems with this show, but there was no part of me that wanted to drop the series. I'm not sure why; maybe the positives I mentioned kept me invested. That's why I have to give it at least a 6. I will also see the second season. I hope it is better, because this show obviously did something right.",

            "content": "Black Butler is an odd mix of comedy, drama, fantasy and yaoi undertones. There are few anime out there that can combine comedy and drama without ruining one of these elements, sadly enough Black Butler is not one of these shows. The comedy totally ruins the drama and is often unfunny and immature, the bishies and yaoi tropes were unnecessary and the fantasy didn't make sense. But for some reason, this anime is in the top 50 most popular anime on MAL, why? Probably because it had bishies, a hot butler, nice music, pretty animation and a gay death god that tries to make senpainotice him, oh so hilarious. \\n\\n\r\n~Story~ 3/10\\n\r\nWe meet our main character, a 10 year old boy (who looks like a girl) and gives his soul in exchange for revenge against the people who killed his parents and tortured him. Two years have passed and our main character, Ciel Phantomhive, has a demon butler who helps him with his revenge (and cleans his house). Though they don't really seem to care about taking revenge, because they're way to busy with drinking tea and solving crimes. The queen decided to make Ciel her personal detective for some kind of reason, we never really discover why, but now Ciel wastes his time with solving crimes. And for some kind of reason are there always supernatural creatures involved in those crimes, so Sebastian can show of his fabulous demon fighting skills, while fighting them. The first episode was amazing, there was a dark atmosphere, the main characters looked interesting and the plot twist near the end was great. And then everything went downhill, our main character and his demon butler get a mission, they discover that something supernatural is involved, they solve the mystery and Sebastian says \"I'm one hell of a butler\", then there is another mission or a filler, in the last case the viewer is tortured with the Phantomhive servants (also known as comedic relief no one asked for) screwing up things and sucking at everything except for killing people. This kind of \"comedic relief\" totally ruined the drama in the anime, even a clich\u00e9 sad backstory didn't make these servants more interesting, because their only use in this anime is screwing up everything. \\n\\n\r\nThe setting also fails, no one behaves like they're supposed to do in the Victorian age. Still, the first part of the story is decent, some episodes were actually good, but the second half was just a convoluted mess. Nothing that happened made sense, characters behaved out of character (Sebastian leaves Ciel for a stupid reason), plot twists came out of nowhere and unexplained supernatural occurrences happened. Only the ending was great, the last minutes of the show were better than the whole second half together. But then, the creators decided to ruin that by creating a sequel that just erased the great ending of the first anime, like it never happened. Amazing job writers!\\n\r\n{CONCLUSION}\\n\r\nThe story was decent in the first half and a total mess in the second half. There were way too many fillers and none of these fillers were funny or interesting, they were just a waste of time. Also the gay undertones (everything about Ciel, Grell's behavior towards Sebastion, crossdressing for no good reason and so on) were unnecessary. It didn't add anything to the plot, but it just attracted those annoying teenage girls who love yaoi pairings and name themselves 'missPhantomhive489' on YouTube.  \\n\\n\r\n~Art~ 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation was very good, especially the backgrounds and clothes. The anime is set the Victorian age setting and the buildings were very realistic and fitted the time period (the behavior of the characters didn't). The character designs were quite feminine, Ciel really looks like a girl even without wearing a dress, but not bad. Every character had their own distinct features, which made them stand out. The animation was also pretty good during the fights and during the comedic relief moments (I still hate these moments, but the animation looked good)\\n\r\n{CONCLUSION}\\n\r\nThe animation was great. Yes, bishies everywhere but the backgrounds were spectacular. Not a single character looked boring and the clothes were very detailed. The animation was probably one of the best things about this show. And I have to admit, Sebastian throwing knives and forks at random baddies  looks extremely epic. \\n\\n\r\n~Music~ 9/10\\n\r\nThe opening song \"Kiss of Monochrome\" is great and really fits the more dramatic parts of the show. The first ending song \"I'm ALIVE!\" is an upbeat J-pop song that fits the stupid comedic relief moments. The chibi art style of the animation of the ending song was actually quite amusing. But the second ending song is on a whole new level, \"Lacrimosa\" is sad, melancholic and extremely beautiful. The background music was nothing special but certainly not bad and the voice acting was very good. Especially Sebastian's voice actor did an amazing job. The music was simply put great.\\n\r\n{CONCLUSION}\\n\r\nThe first ending song was okay and the opening and second ending song were amazing. The background music was good and the (Japanese) voice actors did a great job. The best thing about Black Butler was the music, and that is not meant as an insult, the music was just damn great.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~ 2/10\\n\r\nOur main character is a snobby, spoiled, edgy, teenage bishie, sorry Ciel but you're not only an annoying person, you're also a bad character. His motivations are unclear, his behavior is inconsistent and drinking tea does not make anyone seem 'cool'. Also, he's just a walking mannequin, the creators were too busy with making him wear fancy dresses to give him a likeable (or at least tolerable) personality. Sebastian is just a hot and perfect butler, he seems more like a perfect boyfriend than a scary demon. Which was probably on purpose, because now the fangirls have someone to ship Ciel with, or themselves. Though he has as much depth as a paddling pool, he's enjoyable to watch (something that can't be said about Ciel). His fighting scenes were pretty cool and he has style. And of course, let's not forget 'I'm one hell of a butler'. He's a badly written character who's a joy to watch. And then we have the Phantomhive servants, they were useless, whiny, annoying and not funny. Their 'sad' background stories were extremely clich\u00e9 and they ruined every attempt to make this show dramatic (or a bit more mature). Grell is a gay shinigami, who wants to bang Sebastian and just like the servants, his role is to ruin every attempt to make this show serious, oh and his constant nosebleeds are not funny at all. And there is Elizabeth, the most whiny and useless love interest for a protagonist since Misa from Death Note (and even Misa has more brains than this walking candy cane) and her attempts to make everything 'cute' annoyed the heck out of me. I was literally cheering when Ciel tried to slap her. Every other side character is either boring or horrible (aside from Undertaker, he was pretty cool).\\n\r\n{CONCLUSION}\\n\r\nIt it so difficult to create cast with at least one character who's tolerable, let alone well written? Ciel is a edgy, whiny and spoiled teenage boy living in Victorian England, but behaving like he lives in the present. Sebastian (that name is so damn clich\u00e9 for an English butler) is way too perfect and lacks any form of depth, but it's a joy to watch him kill people with knives and forks. Grell is a joke, he's gay for Sebastian and that's everything about him. The servants are annoying 'comedic relief' and Elizabeth has a place in my top ten most annoying anime love interests. She did not a single useful thing in 24 episodes, not a single thing! The rest of the cast is not even worth talking about and Undertaker is okay.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ 5/10\\n\r\nThis was my third anime and when I watched it for the first time, I actually enjoyed it, but when I rewatched it, I realized how flawed this show actually is. It is possible to enjoy this anime when you're either new to anime in general, when you just want to have some fun with a supernatural show without thinking to much about the story or the characters or when you love yaoi undertones and bishies in dresses. It's not a horrible show, but the plot is a mess, the characters are weak and the yaoi undertones are annoying. Still, if you have a lot of time to waste or you just want to turn of your brain, then you might want to watch this show, in every other case, there are way better anime out there!  \\n\r\n{CONCLUSION}\\n\r\nIt's an under average show. Certainly not the worst anime, but also not worth the praise it gets and the enormous fan base. If you value you free time and prefer good anime, I would suggest that you skip this show. Oh and fans, can you please stop making creepy Ciel x Sebastian fanart? That's pedofilic demon yaoi, just don't. Peace!",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji, or Black butler. What an interesting concept. Supernatural beings living in the 1800s London. Having a demon as your butler, living in a mansion, doing detective work for the queen her majesty. \r\nI have not watched any of its sequel yet, so I'm reviewing this based purely on the first season. \r\nSTORY (Concept 4/5, Development 2/5) \r\nStory is a fairly weird part of the show. The structure of the arcs reminds me of Darker than Black and Cowboy Bebop. Every episode or sometimes every two episodes concerns of a certain event that involves certain characters. The problem is, instead of leaving the arcs tothemselves, the writer keeps elements presented from these arcs weaving around until the very end where the grand finale that draws all the things happened before together. \\n\\n\r\nI dislike shows that doesn't have a continuous plot, so I don't like how the story is told in Black butler.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem I have with this type of story is that, the author tries too hard to make all the connections, but fails to make the individual arcs interesting. \\n\\n\r\n---The following paragraph may be considered a semi-spoiler for some audience---\\n\\n\r\nThe Indian Prince arc for example, serves a purpose of introducing the Queen's butler. Not that there is anything wrong with it, it is just that the butler barely got any screen time in the arc. This leads to the problem that when Queen's butler actually becomes a major character, nobody knows anything about him and the \"connection\" the writer tries to make starts to feel forced. \\n\\n\r\n---Potential Spoiler Ends---\\n\\n\r\nWhat frustrates me the most is that the ending of the series is actually really cool and awesome. Despite the fact that I forced myself to go over the series so hard before I reached somewhere around episode 16, the ending did make me say \"Wow.\" \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I'd like the mention is that most of the time I always thought this is a slice of life anime. It just doesn't feel serious enough with all those fooling around by Ciel's servants and other trolling characters. Which means this anime cannot, and should not be marathoned if you want to enjoy it to the fullest. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think on a grand scheme the story is actually pretty good. But when you actually go in and enjoy it, it fails to grab my attention and it was BORING. \\n\\n\r\nBut why would so many people love this series so much? Let's go in to the characters. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (Design 5/5, Development 3/5)\\n\\n\r\nThe main Characters are Ciel and Sebastian. \\n\\n\r\nThe mighty Sebastian is really a virus. I do admit I fangirled him quite a bit as a healthy heteralsexual male. He is simply so cool and calm and awesome. He is artistic, gentle and occasionally, inhuman on both emotional and physical levels. Sebastian Serves as a ultimate weapon that only unleash his full power at critical moments. \\n\\n\r\nThat alone is already great enough for people to stay in front of the screen and watch the show. The problem is however, Sebastian never needs to consider any potential danger serious matter until the very last arc. This bothers me a little bit since Sebastian did not change at all throughout the plot: His relationship with Ciel doesn't change and his ideology stay intact. \\n\\n\r\nCiel is a 12 year old noble who is the last seed of the grand Phantomhive family. By making a contract with Sebastian, he escaped the fire that killed both his parents. As a young noble who suddenly becomes responsible for his family pride and duty, he grow as a determined child over the course of time spent with his Butler. Ciel, unlike Sebastian, did change his ideology and experienced some personal growth from the events, which is quite pleasant. \\n\\n\r\nCiels' other servents, (A chef, a gardener, a maid, and a recorder) all serve as plot relieves. Even though they are eventually introduced with background stories at the end of show, they are... irrelevant for the must part of the show. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters such as grim reapers' association, which acts as a third party that always help (except the first arc) Ciel and Sebastian unintentionally, is an interesting addition as well. Nothing such as development can be considered, so they are purely for the supporting role. \\n\\n\r\nTo wrap things up, the characters are interesting, and I see how the female audience enjoys it so much. But objectively speaking, they are not that well presented. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGRAPHIC (Art 5/5, Animation 2/5)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very beautiful. It shows the wonderful landscape of the old England. The character are also very pretty and appealing, Ladies are pretty and the men are cool, especially Sebastian. However, many scenes are way too simplified and becomes like kids' comic style drawing. I suppose this is just my personal dislike since some people like lots of funny and plot relieves. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation however, fairly weak. The action scenes are not well rendered, which makes them... fairly boring. That said, Sebastian's power are still amusing to watch. Still images are literally found anywhere to the point where I felt closing my eyes and listen to the anime is more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nArt is very good, but the way they animated isn't that great. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (OP/ED 2/3, OST 2/3, Dub 4/4)\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending, to be honest are very great songs. I actually like them so much that I don't skip them and enjoy the beautiful combination of animation and sound. However, if you remove the graphic and listen to the songs by themselves... They become quite forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nOST are also on a okay level. Definitely not memorable. But they are not trash either. They are simply too plain and doesn't stand out with the dialogues. But after all, they are only OSTs, they are just supposed to be served as background in the show.  \\n\\n\r\nHa. I have no freaking idea why you should resist the dub at all. Unless you are a native British person who hates American people try to speak in British accent, there is absolutely no reason to not like the dub. This is not saying the Original Japanese is not good however. Both are very emotional and well acted. But why would you NOT want BRITISH English in a show that has the old BRITAIN as the stage??? \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nI did not like it for the majority of the show, but the ending sort of made everything up. As a person who loves serious, continuous plot, I don't find myself enjoying the series too much. This is not to say that it is not good. If you watch them maybe 2 episodes a day, it should be fairly enjoyable. If you are a fan for Sebastian... Well, good for you, you will love it. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, for the last 8 episodes, I did enjoy them. The story became serious and interesting. So, I felt it was a good series after I completed it, but during the time I watched it, I didn't. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nI can see why people loved it. The concept was simply unique and brilliant. But if you look at it in a critical point of view, it kinda... failed to be a respectable piece of entertainment. \\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I think everyone should watch it. After all the ending is great and for people don't mind episodic stories and easily get intrigued in the settings, this show is golden. For others, it is still worth a shot since it has a very unique concept and style comparing to the rest of the animes. \\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

            "content": "I genuinely loathe this anime, and it has little to do with the supposed yaoi overtones within it. Let's move on with this.\r\nNOTES NOTES: This is speaking ONLY for the anime. So don't click \"Not helpful\" because you've read through the manga and/or find horrible inconsistencies with canon past episode 6, which is where I dropped it.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nWell, it starts off nice, with a good dark theme going for it, what with all the demonic butlers and children dead set on revenge. And for a while, it was worthwhile. Then comes episode 6, the introduction of the Shinigami, where it steamrolls itself downward. At thispoint I dropped it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nWell, it's a decently animated bishounen wonderland. The coloring is pretty good, and the Victoriana theme is actually rolling along fine.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nThere wasn't really anything notable about it, so meh.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nI'm going to try to pack some very angry stuff in a lot of words, kthx. This is going to be pretty comprehensive, yet not very long for individuals.\\n\\n\r\nSebastian: Pretty okay concept turned into this retched Gary-Stu. He's too prefect in every thing ever, and wants this kid's soul. Oh and he's a demon.\\n\r\nCiel: Kinda an asshole kid hell-bent on revenge. He crossdresses or something and people like to ship him with his butler.\\n\r\nFinnian: Dumb unfunny attempt at comedic relief.\\n\r\nMaylene: Dumb unfunny klutz attempt at comedic relief.\\n\r\nBaldroy: Not really notable unfunny attempt at comedic relief.\\n\r\nTanaka: The normal, not funny/speshul butler who winds up being a failed attempt at comedic relief.\\n\r\nMadame Red/Angelina Durless: woah woah waoh a female who plays a role in the plot until she is killed, in the climax of the Jack the Ripper arc.\\n\r\nDamian: First episode and that's it. Nothing special other than he decides to attempt to con Ciel. And fails.\\n\r\nElizabeth Middleford: The moeblob. Oh, she winds up angering Ciel too, but Sebastian is all like \"I'M TOO COOL FOR YOUR RAEG, BUT I'LL MAKE IT BETTER\".\\n\r\nLau: The token Chinese mafioso. That's it pretty much.\\n\r\nAleister Chamber: He's a perv who attempts to sell a crossdressing Ciel. He's an uberbishounen.\\n\r\nUndertaker: A Shinigami, but that's only in the anime. He deals with dead bodies and whatnot and has a pretty high bishounen level.\\n\r\nLord Randall: He has sideburns. THAT IS PRETTY MUCH HIS PURPOSE\\n\r\nAzzurro Vanel: Like Lau, but without the chinese. He sells drugs too. Also, he winds up kidnapping! What fun this is, because it's basically the first arc!\\n\r\nRan-Mao: Lau's assistant. Just kinda hangs out for a while.\\n\r\nMary Jane Kelly: Could very well provoke FEMINIST RAEG with the things that happen to her.\\n\r\nWilliam Spears: A Shinigami, who's always frowning. He's a supervisor who winds up having to baby the next character...\\n\r\nGrell Sutcliff: Another Shinigami. Basically an insultingly campy gay with a chainsaw. If an anime could be ruined by one character, this would be it. He's pretty incompetent when he's first introduced, and continues to be. The only reason the fandom likes him, from what I can tell, is that he's gay and/or MTF. And that's a pretty stupid reason to love an annoyingly incompetent character. Oh, and he's got some definite Stu going on, because he screws the rules pretty hard while with Angelina. His voice actor makes it worse.\\n\r\nShinigami in general: Two words: Anachronism Stew.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, I really, really loathe this anime. The fandom does not help at all either. If you're into Victoriana themes and art, and have a callous disregard to plot and characterization, you're going to LOVE this. Otherwise, go watch something else. It's for your own good.",

            "content": "Ok, my first review. please be kind! English is not my native language so please excuse any spelling or grammatical errors.\r\nOkay, first of all I will be comparing this series to the original manga, mostly because well I'm following it and it is pretty awesome, but also because I began to read the manga when this series first aired and I wanted to know what it what about before I saw the anime. \r\nI'm going to start with animation and music, and then end with story and characters.\r\nThe animation is good but not great. The animations style is very similar to X an anime seriesreleased in 2001, which had fantastic animation. However there are two problems with the animation in Kuroshitsuji compared to X. The first and biggest problem is that the quality of the animation is not consistent. Some of the scenes are really beautiful, while others are really amateurish. And this is something that really bothers me. If you can't keep the quality on the highest level consistently through the whole series, then don't. It is distracting, and don't look very professional. \\n\r\nThe second problem is that it is to brightly colored in relevance to the mood it's trying to set.\\n\\n\r\nIf you listen to the soundtrack separately from the series, then it sound great and it really fits. But in the anime you can barely hear it because the volume is to low, especially the music that isn't cheerful or bright. It is a big mistake they did.\\n\r\nThe opening theme is fantastic, especially with the first animation opening. The animation is perfectly matched with the music. But the second one not so much. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea that you keep the opening theme but change the animation, however it does not work in the second one. The animation don't keep up as well as the first one did and the images don't grip you the same way the first one did.\\n\r\nAnd the endings? Liked them, nothing more to comment on really.\\n\\n\r\nOk, time for the characters and the story. This is were some of my real problems with the series lies. Both Sebastian and Ciel is... I would not say completely wrong but there is some misinterpretation here. \\n\r\nYes, agree with some of the of the other reviewers, Ciel is a little brat in the anime. And sure he is a little brat in the manga to, but he is far more likable and interesting. Mostly because in the manga they really go into what has happened to him in his past better, and because he there really seams like a child how had to grow up to fast. But, yes he is very poorly executed in the anime.\\n\r\nNow on to Sebastian. He is not a Gary Stu. I will say that again. He is NOT a Gary Stu. He isn't that type of perfect. Yes, he can do amazing things but that is because he isn't human. He is a demon and therefor extremely strong, and well... awesome. He was written specifically like this because of who he is.\\n\r\nHowever I can see why he doesn't work that well in the anime. And that is because he is well... to nice. In the manga he isn't kind or nice. He gives an appearance of being that but that is only because that is the role he has been ordered to take. He doesn't give a rats-ass about the other servants or Ciel. What he does he does for himself and not for anyone else. The only reason that he does what Ciel tolds him to is because they have made a deal. The ordeals that Ciel is put trough amuses him. He is intrigued by humans and find them interesting even though he does not care about them. \\n\r\nAnd this is one of the biggest problems. There is a big misinterpretation when it comes to Ciels and Sebastians relationship between each other. They're not supposed to have attachment towards each other that they way have they have here. It doesn't work as well as the type they have in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the story. After the Jack the Ripper part things go downwards. At first it is problems with what kind of mood the series want to have. How dark it is supposed be. But then it just stopped making sense. I don't want to spoil to much, but at the end you just sits and wonder why, how and what is happening. It feels a little that they just threw things in that they though could work.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately Kuroshitsuji is an series that couldn't deliver when it ran out of source-material. It gets confusing and somewhat annoying at the end.\\n\r\nThe beginning is great, they keep very close to the original story but things just goes downhill. One of the main problem is that it isn't consistent with ether animation nor the darker elements of the story.\\n\\n\r\nYou can still watch it, and if it makes you interested in the manga then fine. But this is one of my disappointments of great manga-series not getting a proper animated adaptation\\n\\n\\n",

That's why i'm giving my 10 for Seiyu cast.\r\nAbout animation, it was done pretty well. at first i stopped the video and thought, maaybe i have downloaded XXXHOlic again XD?  animation is very similar to XXXHOLIC.\r\ni even thought that maybe this manga was made by clamp...\r\nabout story, its pretty interesting at first glance. andthere is a huge possibility that this anime will develop into shounen-ai.

            "content": "The thing that sets Kuroshitsuji apart from a lot of other shows, especially the over-hyped shounen anime that most people (myself included) have gotten used to, is just how damn dark it is. It\u2019s a show where evil triumphs\u2026 and that\u2019s a good thing. It\u2019s a show that isn\u2019t afraid to kill off characters. And just when you start thinking that maybe Sebastian, for all his demonic powers, isn\u2019t such a bad guy, his utter apathy for the death that unfolds around him shocks the viewer back into the realization that the hero of the show is just plain evil. In fact, it seems thatmost of the characters are shady bastards with hidden agendas, leaving the audience rooting for the forces of evil. Ah, the refreshing feeling of evil winning. [insert maniacal laughter here]\\n\\n\r\nIn most anime worlds, revenge is a fruitless endeavor that never fulfills the way the avenger hopes it will. Most anime, especially shounen anime, exist under the assumption that good will always triumphant over evil (eventually) and that fighting in the name of friendship, honor, or for the sake of others will guarantee victory. So that must make Kuroshitsuji the opposite of shounen anime. The hatred and revenge that dominate Ciel\u2019s heart is what drives Sebastian\u2019s loyalty, and as long as their contract remains, Sebastian\u2019s demonic strength will overcome any of Ciel\u2019s enemies. So, the moral of the story is, live for hatred and a demon will make all your wishes come true. Selling your soul for the win! But I guess when the hero of the show is a demon, evil is going to win over good\u2026 and everything else.",

            "content": "I was debating on whether or not I would even venture into writing a review for this show. To get the general facts out of the way: this was one of the first animes I ever tried watching and the first anime I actually ended up dropping. I guess I gave in to the immense hype surrounding Black Butler and was ultimately disappointed by it. I would like to think I'm not alone.\r\nStory- 6\r\nWhere do I begin? This story had so much potential. I loved the idea of a demon butler who caters to his master's every whim, I guess. As well as the writer'sdedication to keeping all of the titles uniformed with \"His Butler, ..\". It's charming. If only said writer would have stopped after episode 24.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm writing spoiler-free here, but there was an incredibly obvious way of making Black Butler an amazing 24 episode anime. Well of course that can't happen though, can it? Not when you can rake in even more money off of a tired plot!\\n\\n\r\nListen, season 1 is something great. It was enjoyable. Does it make you feel empty on the inside sometimes? Does it make you question the characters' and your own morality? Well, yes. But that doesn't deduct from the quality of the show and the potential it had. Like I said, what ruined it for me personally was the stretching of the show and the tugging on a clearly worn story. For this, I feel the show is overly hyped and not worth it. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 9\\n\r\nBlack Butler's artwork IS the best part of the show. It helps reinforce the plot  and adds to the dark feelings within the show. Everything seems to be dimly lit and extremely lavish which I feel is a positive description of Sebastian, the butler, and Ciel, his master, as well as other socialites within the show. But we'll talk more about them later.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 8\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is similar to the artwork for me where it fits the show entirely and moves the plot along. Not bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 7\\n\r\nWhy only a 7? What did they ever do to you? Well, honestly, they made me feel a bit dead on the inside.\\n\\n\r\nSebastian Michaelis- I loved him for the majority of the season but after a bit he gave me trust issues. Does he want to protect and serve his master or does he just want to take their soul? In my opinion, with Sebastian being a demon, he's not trust worthy. Even when the show painted him out  to be Ciel's hero and fans painted them out to be boyfriends, I still felt creepy undertones of soul sucking. Demons, right? But overall, Sebastian actually was one of the strongest characters and his personality was typically consistent.\\n\\n\r\nCiel Phantomhive- His name rolls off the tongue and is enjoyable to hear but Ciel himself puts me off. To put it lightly, he's had a rough life aside from the fact that he's incredibly rich. His hardships are what cause him to come in contact with his butler, the aforementioned Sebastian Michaelis. Ciel makes a contract with said demon butler because why quit while you're behind? It becomes painstakingly obvious that Ciel is more intelligent than most 12 to 13 year olds when it comes to matters of business. Almost unrealistically so. It becomes even more painstakingly obvious that he's aware of this and though his ego has advanced with his knowledge of the business world, his pride has not. He's such an absolute brat and there doesn't seem to be any character development within him throughout the 24 episodes that I have seen. Which, in my opinion and like I stated previously, should have been where the series ended. \\n\\n\r\nThe Phantomhive household- Seemingly misfit house workers who have taken care of Ciel take a drastic turn a few episodes in. They're still very lovable despite these turns of events. With all of their equally strong personalities, they add an air of humor to the usually calamitous plot line.  \\n\\n\r\nThe Trancy household- A complete mess in and of itself but they still keep the story moving along and make you want to continue on with the show.\\n\\n\r\nElizabeth Ethel Cordelia Midford- Or Lizzie for short. Ciel's, at times, token love? Yes. Also Ciel's cousin? Yes. She too adds some comedy to the show but her relationship with Ciel still left me feeling a bit sad. It all comes across very dry as she is incredibly vapid and Ciel never seems to have any interest in her or what she says or does. If and when he does something for her it usually has some kind of benefit for himself.\\n\\n\r\nThe Nobles- All of these characters have some kind of connection to Ciel due to his social status and all of them have differing opinions of Ciel. They usually make you ask yourself if they're trustworthy people.\\n\\n\r\nGrim Reapers- You thought you could trust them hahahahaaa.\\n\\n\r\nAND there are more characters that I won't even bother going in depth on because they're all too shakey. \\n\r\nThere are so many characters in this series and the show doesn't always go in depth on each one. Most of them remain flat or get dropped within a matter of an episode or two.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 6\\n\r\nSo yeah, I was loving this show until the last few episodes. That's when the final episode of season 1 did me in. I feel like I'm beating a dead horse here but honestly, the story had the perfect ending laid out. Could you foresee it? Yes, but it still would have been a satisfying ending that tied all the loose ends together. Which brings me to my overall score of a 6. You can watch Black Butler for yourself and you may love it as many others have but, personally, this show left me feeling a little empty and sad.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji is an awesome anime. It is filled with darkness, and even a bit of humor. It is very good for people wanting a thick plot that leaves you with answers and wanting to figure everything out. Thankfully, there will be a second season coming out to (hopefully) explain everything.\r\nSTORY: 9\r\nAll right. Kuroshitsuji had a strong plot. It was full of twists and surprises. It started pretty light at first, but it kept getting darker and darker. If you're looking for something like Hayate no Gotoku, then DEFINITELY stay away from this. Ciel Phantomhive is a spoiled kid who has a demon butler. Simple, right?Not at all. We learn that although Ciel is only a child, he can get into some pretty deep stuff. Unfortunately, because of his age (12), it was a little hard to believe. But you will eventually become used to this. It has a lot of action and death, which kept it very interesting. It not only covers those categories, but it also covers psychological things. It really is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art is awesome! They really portrayed London well. Everything to the background and clothes was really detailed... sometimes. The colors were dark, which really fit the mood of the anime. Not much to say about it. You can tell that Ciel wears the most fashionable things. Obviously. Everyone has a distinct look about them. The art sometimes loses it's details and lacks, but only occasionally.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\\n\r\nEhh... not much to say about sound. The openings and endings were okay. Nothing really memorable, although I did like the first ending, but that's just me. The seiyuus were great, though. They spoke a bit of engrish, which was entertaining to hear.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were great! Ciel is really spoiled and mature, but that only made me pity him that he could never be immature. It was weird watching a child be so stoic. He RARELY ever smiles, and is very bossy. Sebastian remained mysterious throughout the whole series, but I suppose that that was intended. He is completely \"loyal\" to Ciel. But he does not really seem to care about his well being. The side characters all have their own background, which was actually pretty shocking. I won't give anything away, though.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment was high because of all the suspense and surprises. Don't underestimate this anime. It really sucks you in and keeps you watching. The contract between Ciel and Sebastian (a.k.a. Sebas-chan or Sebby) was interesting. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9\\n\\n\r\nRead the whole review. (I'm getting really lazy.)\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to people who want a great plot with good characters with questionable motives, and a lot of mystery...",

            "content": "Where to begin with such an interesting, heart-wrenching, emotional, hilarious, and macabre anime such as this? \r\nWell, not on any plane that Kuroshitsuji stands on. Those descriptions are saved for other anime that actually live up to those qualities.\r\nA while ago, I heard about Kuroshitsuji, A.K.A. Black Butler, kicking up a storm for most of the younger viewers in the anime audience. This does not include the entirety of the audience, just a large portion of it. I became interested in it, seeing as how somewhat lurid, supernatural animes are very interesting when done correctly. Before investigating further upon the animation, I read a fewvolumes into the manga. I enjoyed the art style and found the characters to be quite complex and entertaining in their own little quirks. Of course, it was only a first impression, and with that assumption, I took to the hills and decided to watch the series in its entirety. \\n\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji is about a young boy known as Ciel Phantomhive makes a contract at the age of ten with a demon, who is known in the series as Sebastian (`dem clich\u00e9 Victorian names). Sebastian has agreed to serve as Ciel`s butler in exchange for his soul, doing Ciel`s bidding in any way his master desires. Earl Ciel Phantomhive, better known as the Queen`s guard-dog, as he does what the queen requests him to, owns his own toy company, which is very well-known and quite successful. The first & second seasons take place when Ciel is twelve (later thirteen), and play out in a Victorian London setting where Ciel and Sebastian go off to solve various cases every so often when the show feels like it acquires progression (and I use the term `solving cases` very loosely) and all the while, causing antics while interacting with a variety of different characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, to me, at least, sounded like an original one, and although the rest of this review will be bashing the anime in most of its entirety, I will give Black Butler credit where it is due. The idea of master and butler, with the servant having power over the situation at all times, and in a Victorian setting, is quite engaging. Not to mention that it wasn\u2019t a badly written anime. The pacing wasn\u2019t absolutely appalling, and the anime set itself up at a good pace from the beginning. Kuroshitusji knew where it wanted to go, and it went there at a reasonable pace. This applies more to the first season than the second season, but it`s not something that takes away from the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nI shall also not pass up the opportunity to praise the soundtrack. The orchestral music is phenomenal, and fits very well within the setting. The orchestra is incredible, and even now, I`ll still listen to the soundtrack from time to time. Personally, I think the soundtrack of the second season is better than the first, as you can tell the sound directors really put their all into the second season. Not to mention that both the first and second season were pretty well animated. Nothing was distracting, animation wise, and the setting was well done. It wasn\u2019t anything truly special, but it was something that I noticed.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I give it originality points for story, as I mentioned pacing earlier, and how Black Butler knew where it wanted to go, it did go, but only whenever the show felt like actually progressing the story-line. Most episodes were filler or useless, and while the beginning fillers entertained me, some of the yaoi and over-used anime tropes were quite prominent in almost all filler episodes. I could skip complaining about fillers in a review such as this, but because there were so many, it cannot possibly be looked over so easily. Most fillers were for either fan-service or comedic relief, which seemed a bit odd for me to see. The show had been taking itself quite seriously in the beginning episodes, and when there was just so much `ha-ha, look at this funny trope that`s been used before!` seen in this anime, it made me re-think that maybe this show was meant for pleasing its fans. The show tried to take itself seriously again, but then slipped back into dumb clich\u00e9s and moments which were just plain annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters can be split up into two categories: those that are important to the story itself, and those that are there just to be there. The characters to help thicken the plot are the obvious, main two characters. There`s also another character who fits into this category, but as to not spoil the series, I will not say the character`s name. It`s a shame the all the rest of the characters in the series (besides the antagonist, of course) were just there to be there. Whether it be for hilarity factor, or to give some form of information to the main characters and the audience, with everything in-between, the rest of the characters in the series besides Ciel and Sebastian are completely forgettable. Grell, a very flamboyant character in Kuroshitsuji, is not at all forgettable, although I wish he was. \\n\\n\r\nCiel was given some character development in both series, but not much. He was still a cocky bastard all the way to the end, and the only depth he was given was his tragic backstory. Sebastian, a very delightful character in the series, can still be seen as a 2D figure rather than the full three dimensional product with his entire character being interesting. He has a few clich\u00e9s involving the `perfect being who can do anything` type of trope, that follow along with many other supernatural beings of all genres. While I agree that he was the most interesting character of the series, and brought life to most of the show, the only type of character development he got was in season two, which is so often over-looked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the only reason I truly enjoyed the show for what it was was because of the characters and a few of the witty fillers brought into the show. I didn\u2019t enjoy the amount of effort put into the show beforehand to try to portray this mysterious and supernatural setting, while it later ended in too many silly fillers to count. Sure, it`s a good show for fan-service for a more female audience, but that`s basically it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you`re a newcomer to anime, and want something to watch, I might suggest Black Butler to you. But, if you`re one who`s somewhat experienced in watching Japanese animation, skip it.\\n\\n\r\nThere`s a reason they call Kuroshittytsuji.\\n\\n\r\nRate: 6/10",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji was written by Toboso Yana, published by Square-Enix and had an anime adaptation from A-1 Pictures, a studio that I have never watched an anime from. So, let's take a look at the series and get a vague idea of what the studio is made of. \r\nThe story is pretty simple. A boy named Ciel Phantomhive, the orphaned son of a wealthy family, is on a quest to get revenge on his parents' killers while making his business a success. Naturally, he sets up a cave hideout and puts on a garish costume after training his mind and body extensively... Wait, that's a differentorphaned son of a wealthy family. No, Ciel takes a more supernatural route. He makes a pact with a demon. The demon will serve as his butler and protect him until he has his revenge at which point Ciel's soul will be forfeit. For all the serious story elements, the story itself has a pretty goofy tone. It's one of those series that blends more serious content with heavy comedic elements. Which is risky since the approach can fail horribly with all kinds of tonal issues. Of course, it can also work pretty well. In Kuroshitsuji's case, it works more often than not. There are some awkward shifts, but most of the individual story arcs keep a pretty consistent tone throughout and the changes are paced well enough that they don't come off as stilted or awkward. One complaint I do have is that the climax is pretty rushed. There are basically two climactic scenes, one of which is a battle that gets a lot of build up, and they're both crammed into the final episode without much spacing or time for the action to wind down. That being said, the story is mostly really good with some intriguing elements and nice twists.\\n\\n\r\nNow we move onto the characters. There are some really good characters in this. Ciel has some great moments but the best character has to be Sebastian. He's a very interesting character. There are a lot of facets to him that seem contradictory. He always seems to be in control, but he takes on a subservient role. He's a very dark character, but he also has a clear sense of honour. In many ways he's selfish but in others he's kind of selfless. The facets all work together to make an intriguing character who has depth. That being said, not all of the characters in this are that good. Ciel has four other servants who are largely comic relief characters without that much in the way of developed personalities and there are some really problematic elements to Grell's character. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is well done. The character designs are pretty unique and interesting. The action sequences look good and the backgrounds are nice. There are also some moments where the art is legitimately creepy. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast in this is amazing. You have Paku Romi, Ono Daisuke, Sakamoto Maaya, Yajima Akiko and a bunch of other highly skilled actors giving great performances. If there's any weakness it's Fukuyama Jun, not because he's a bad actor, he was quite good in Bleach, Code Geass and Witch Hunter Robin, but because the way his character is written requires a lot of exaggeration that gets pretty grating. The music in this is quite superb as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. There's really no yuri here. \\n\\n\r\nSo, how does Kuroshitsuji fare overall? Well, it has some issues, but most of them aren't too detrimental. The story is interesting and the disparate tones work surprisingly well together. There are some great characters, and they're the ones we get to spend the most time with while the weaker characters are less prominent. The casting and art are really strong. So, I have to give it an overall score of 8/10. It's a great anime and well worth the time. I'm honestly not sure how they managed to have another series with it. Find out next week when I look at Kuroshitsuji II.",

            "content": "I will start by saying that I have mixed feelings about this anime.\r\nI read the manga beforehand, which means that I already had my ideas about the characters and knew how the story would develop. It also means that I am biased. If you don't care about the manga you might consider reading a review written by someone who has seen the anime first (or only that), it will probably be less biased.\r\nThe strong points of Kuroshitsuji are the characters and the story. Add to this good animation, great seiyuu and beautiful music and you get this anime. All in all I recommend it, especiallyif you fancy the genre, but as a fan of the manga I can't avoid making comparisons.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, set in Victorian England, is essentially dark and manages to skillfully mix together mystery, drama, angst and humor. It's made up of a few arcs, with some fillers usually inserted as \"break points\" between two arcs, but it's one long story. The first half of it is mostly faithful to the manga, while the second half develops into a completely original story. The manga is still running, so the anime has an ending of its own.\\n\r\nAs for the setting, if you're an expert of the Victorian era you might cringe at some anachronisms, but the fact that demons and other supernatural beings are involved should make you realize that the story is not exactly aiming to be a perfect replica of Victorian England.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all have different visuals and personalities that make them stand out and they're all interesting in their own way. Even minor characters are very likable. One thing that you realize almost right away is that there are mostly no \"good\" or \"bad\" people. You might sympathize with some of the characters, making them \"more good\" inside your mind, but that's usually not the case if you look at them from an objective point of view. However, all of this is undermined by the main original character in the anime, but I'll get back to it later.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is fluid and generally good. The character designs by Minako Shiba are outstanding. Yana Toboso's art in the manga is very beautiful, and Shiba managed to keep that charm while making it into something that could be animated. The only character I didn't really like is Vincent, because he somehow looks different than he appears in the manga, but I have nothing to complain about the rest.\\n\r\nToboso herself designed all the outfits that appear in the anime (Ciel changes clothes many times). It's nice that they decided to do this instead of giving characters single outfits, even though it means it's more of a hassle to animate.\\n\\n\r\nI was extremely pleased with the seiyuu. Daisuke Ono as Sebastian is a perfect choice, same for Maaya Sakamoto as Ciel. She's usually cast to voice girls or women, so I was really amazed at how wonderfully she can pull this off. As for Sebastian, I was surprised to find out that in the first drama CD he was voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa, and even though I do like Morikawa's voice I think it wouldn't fit Sebastian because it would make him too \"cliche'\" in a way. Ono provides a fitting voice that still manages not to make him sound like a stereotyped butler.\\n\r\nJun Fukuyama is also brilliant as Grell (I must say since I watched the anime every time I read Grell's lines in the manga his voice echoes in my head, this is how much it stuck to my mind), and I admit I didn't even recognize Junichi Suwabe as the Undertaker when I first heard his voice.\\n\r\nThe other seiyuu are all very good choices too.\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Taku Iwasaki is fitting and beautiful. The soundtrack is very diverse and flawlessly matches every single scene. I'm especially fond of the sad and melodic BGMs, which are very nice to listen to as a standalone as well.\\n\r\nThe OP/EDs are good songs, with beautifully animated pictures. Though I must say the first ED, \"I'm alive\", is a bit random (the song itself is not bad, but I don't really see how that fits Kuroshitsuji).\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, all in all it's an anime I'd recommend, but I'll go a bit more into detail as to why I have mixed feelings about it.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the first half of the show, especially the Jack the Ripper Arc. It's very faithful to the manga, and you might think this makes it a bit boring for the ones who already know the story, but the animation is beautiful and the seiyuu are perfect, thus it's actually enjoyable because it's like watching the characters you love come to life. Too bad it goes downhill in the second half...\\n\\n\r\nThe story completely takes off into an original development (different than the manga's) from about halfway through the Curry Arc. I won't go into detail not to spoil what happens, but it already started looking gloom when the ending of said arc was turned into something quite lame. But it still got worse.\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem, in my opinion, is that the original characters -- though it's hard to say \"characterS\", seeing as only one really stands out -- are not interesting enough, their motives are random or trite and they have basically no character development. The appearance of someone that could be called \"the big baddie\" is not necessarily a bad thing, but if that character is stereotyped and lame then it becomes quite boring to watch.\\n\r\nI also disliked what was made of Queen Victoria in the anime. In the manga she's very funny, but in the anime she just makes no sense and, unlike many other characters in the series, she's also very hard to sympathize with.\\n\r\nSebastian is also too \"emotional\", with little to no character development to explain why he suddenly became like that. As much as I don't dislike some fanservice (as long as it's not over-the-top), I would prefer it to have some concrete basis if it must be used in such a serious way.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also makes use of some things (mostly lines/dialogues, but also scenes) that happened in the later arcs of the manga, but adapting them to fit a whole different situation. However, in most cases they didn't succeed in keeping them as brilliant as they were in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe last few episodes contain many scenes where - in my opinion - Sebastian is very out of character, which is a bit of a turn off even though at least Ciel is coherent. In addition, the action is quite exaggerated, as is the paranormal aspect of the story, that in the manga is not as recurring, contrary to what you might think.\\n\\n\r\nAll this said, I did love the very last episode. It's beautiful and it's actually something that I could have seen happen in the manga as well (of course now it probably won't considering that it's already been done). A reason I love it is also that it's a kind of ending that could fit many different plots and not necessarily the one that was used in the anime. (In other words, I can pretend that what happened before it didn't exist.)\\n\\n\r\nIf it were for the first half of the anime, I would have given it a 9, but the second half deserves a 5 in my opinion, so overall it gets a 7 from me. I understand that it's hard to create an anime of a series that is still running, because you either leave it open or you have to close it somehow. This time they decided to invent a whole different plot, with a solution of its own and thus also an ending of its own. Too bad the plot itself, and the characters involved in it, are disappointing and boring, not to mention too cliche'. I'm not necessarily against original storylines, as long as they make sense. With season 2 they proved to be able to create nice ones, so I wished they had put a bit more effort into the original characters of season 1 as well.\\n\\n\r\nI still recommend this anime, especially because watching it also allows you to watch season 2 as well (and that's much better, in my very humble opinion), but also because, story aside, it's very enjoyable thanks to the nice animation/music/seiyuu and, last but not least, interesting characters (main villains aside). Anyway, feel free to take this review with a grain of salt. As I said, I read the manga before watching the anime, so you might get a different impression if you haven't read the manga beforehand.",

One of the noble families of England: Phantomhive's butler: Sebastian Michaels has got unquestionably perfect knowledge, manners, talent with materials, martial arts, et cetera: but is also able to serve a 12 year old master. Wearing a grey tailcoat, gracefully brewing the worlds strongest red tea, please read on to see how such a perfect butler copes with such a master...\" (directly copy and pasted from onemanga, btw)\\n\\n\r\nI thought \"Oh! That sounds funny! A really happy manga!\" HAHAHAHA! Yeah RIGHT! This thing ended up being one of the darkest, horrific, and twisted mangas I've ever read! And I STILL loved it!\\n\\n\r\nEven though my initial idea of the manga was totally misconceived I still found enjoyment of the highest degree.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the story is really about is the pair, Sebastian (the perfect butler) and Ciel (the cold, calculating 12-year-old), living in the underworld of high society. Ciel is an orphan with a fortune, an eyepatch, a noble rule, and a deal with the demon Sebastian. In the manga we don't know the details of this deal (and you do in the anime but I don't trust animes. They lie. A lot.) jut that Sebastian has to protect Ciel at all cost until a certain time at which point Sebastian gets Ciel's soul.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this is all rather heavy for a twelve-year-old (heck, at the time they made the deal, Ciel was 10!) but Ciel never appears to waver. He is strong, smart, cold, and far from merciful.\\n\r\nAt least that's what he tries to be. As the story progresses, it becomes more and more obvious that Ciel is desperate to hide all emotion so as to protect himself from the world. His experiences hardened him and much of the series seems to be about him facing his own innocence and realizing his weaknesses.\\n\\n\r\nBut where Ciel is an open book, ready to read by anxious readers, Sebastian is closed off and a mystery. His constant smile and dark manor is menacing and you can't help but suspect he's only caring for Ciel for his tasty, tasty soul. But in the anime there are moments that suggest he may actually care for Ciel.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to note at his time that this series is NOT a shounen ai/yaoi. Since the two main characters are a bishi and a shouta and they have a \"unique relationship\" it is assumed they are taking part in \"inappropriate conduct\" (aka they're joining NMBLA). I think this is disgusting. I can't believe people wish to think that. Why must wholesome reationships be tarnished with people's perverted minds?!\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between these two is like a forced trust. Sebastian knows Ciel can't hurt him and Ciel knows Sebastian is bound by a sacred contract that can't be broken. Sebastian is the only person Ciel can trust unconditionally and since Sebastien is so strong he knows that if anyone even tries to cross him, they're dead. It's not love, just a partnership. \\n\\n\r\nNow that I'm done with that, I'd like to make note of the story. As opposed to most shoujos, this series is divided into lots of mini arcs and stories which usually teach you something knew about the characters. They tend to start off with Ciel being told by the Queen to go do something for her. Then Ciel has to run off with Sebastian and do her bidding. These stories will usually start of with lots of funny, clever comments partnered with new characters to further the story. Then it plunges into some deep, dark plot line from whence are heroes may never return (they always do anyway).\\n\\n\r\nIn a lot of ways this manga reminds me of GodChild. Very dark and set in the same period. The only difference is I actually like the art in Kuroshitsuji. The detail is through the roof with high style, delicious sweets and lovely London town and when it comes to costumes, I've yet to see it's better. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I can understand why this series is so popular. \r\nI actually really enjoyed watching this because it was whimsical and had it's dark moments as well. However, the reason why I rated it as an overall six is because the story fell apart last minute and just didn't make much sense.\r\nSo - Story 5/10. \r\nThe story had so. much. bloody. potential. I wanted to rate it higher, but like I said, it sort of fell apart at the end. What was happening just wasn't making sense and this series would have benefited from a little more attention to filling in plot holes. Or at least,exploring the characters a bit deeper. It would have been nice to see some more on the Death Gods society and the pasts of Ciel's servants than what was presented. Even if they didn't explain the whole motives of the antagonist, I would have rated higher if there was more on the Death Gods and servants. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe beautiful artwork is what made me want to watch this series in the first place. It's extremely colourful without losing losing the dark tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNormally, I don't really pay attention to background music, but it was hard not to in this series. It was pretty, and no repetitive as it sometimes is in other animes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI really loved Ciel Phantomhive's character. On the other hand, there were characters that I couldn't stand. Grell Sutcliffe being one of them. He was entirely one dimensional. The servants characters were okay, like I said earlier, I wish a little more time was spent on them so you understand them better. The provided comedic relief, but at the end I found it hard to care about whether they survived or not. Also, it was hard to understand the motives of the antagonists, and thats... not... good... But as for Sebastian, the titular character, he is perfect. In this context though, it works. Normally I hate perfect characters but Sebastian is only fulfilling his duty as a butler and it's just expected of him to perform well in everything he does since that's what Ciel sold his soul for him to do. If I was Ciel and Sebastian wasn't perfect, well, I'd feel a bit cheated.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite it's flaws, it was fun to watch the zaniness of the characters and the different mystery settings. My face lit up with joy every time Undertaker came on scene. He was the highlight of the show for me, with Sebastian being bad-ass a close second. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI would like to give this a higher rating. After watching it, I felt like I enjoyed it more than that. But... I guess I'll just have to read the manga since the stories are different and hopefully the manga will have a much more satisfying ending than the anime.",

The characters, artwork and music all draw you in and you find yourself captivated by what each character is hiding and what will happen next. \r\nI would have given a perfect 10 across the board, but there were some parts at the end that would have been better explained in more detail. Not to say the ending wasn't good. I think the ends pretty much perfectly for the way the series was laid out, but once you watch it you'll understand what I mean. I think the story should get about a 9.5because dispite the parts that were left out I think any story that can move you to both laughter and tears and make you feel for the characters really deserves a high rating. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound both get 10s in my book. They work wonderfully together and really enhance the mood and feel of the show.  \\n\\n\r\nI gave 10s to the character development and the enjoyment factor of the show as well. It's very easy to get attached to the characters in this show from the goofy ones (Grell) to the incredibly serious and slightly depressed ones (Ceil). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 10. This is one of the few anime that I've given a 10 to and I think it deserves it. I hope you check it out! ;)\\n",

            "content": "Sapphire!Note: I have not watched the second season yet. This review is only for the first! *meow*\r\n*clears throat and has a cup of tea* There are types of anime shows with strange creatures/demons and cats, and then there is this one....with strange people. I wonder what the Queen of England or a cat would think of this show.  \r\nPlot/Setting: \r\nVery interesting setting. I've always loved historical stories with a twist. They had the timeline right on with Queen Victoria and the fire. But I have never watched an anime set in Great Britain in the late 19th century. It was rather different and givesan idea of more culture. And even the mansion was very high class. I was a bit surprised a child was running it. But I guess living with a demon and people with strange abilities, you can do anything. \\n\\n\r\n*hiss* I wasn't very impressed with the plot. I found there were plot holes throughout the episodes and the pace was off at times. There wasn't really a middle piece and it was filled with several side stories of contests. Reminded me a lot of a crime show actually. Now this might've been the intention all along, what do I know, right? Crime shows usually will have side stories of murders and strange occurrences while the plot is moving. A good live action example would be Grimm. However, the plot did bore me at times. I didn't get the suspenseful feeling until episode 18. I loved when the black cat arrived. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\n*puts on monocle* This shit is so fancy I need a second monocle! I'm always a sucker for the animation of these shows. This one did really good on the designs of the castles. They were all different and very well done. I didn't find any sloppiness of any sort in the character's, background, and other things, and found the art clear as rain. The composition of colours were just spectacular. The effects of the blood and the fire created really nice colour and glow for dramatic effect. The fog in a few episodes captured the creepy atmosphere England is famous for. And, of course, the eyes. Sebastian's especially. When they glowed, it was the most gorgeous colour. \\n\\n\r\nThe cats were the best art in there, though, by far. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nVery eerie, although the opening reminded me of a Tango dance, and I couldn't help but dance at the beginning. But the ending songs went from upbeat and happy, to absolutely dark. It was a strange shift. The music in the episodes created the best atmosphere though. I think it's what made Black Butler so...dark at times. But needs more meows and purrs. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nIn the words of Ciel, \"Where is my rubber ducky, Sebastian!?\" Good day sir! Ciel Ciel Ciel...what can I say. He's the stereotypical rich boy with a fancy butler and believes he's the best in the world. He reminds me of a cat ready to get pampered. There is nothing else to say. He doesn't change very much and is still the same snobby kid at the end- a static character. I was disappointed in that character and didn't find him as likeable as the others. \\n\\n\r\nSebastian would be the leader of the cats if he wasn't Ciel's butler. He would be stereotypical too, if he wasn't a demon and did all these supernatural things, but even then, from all the stories told these days with butlers in them, I find most of them do have that kick ass butler. Even though he is very attractive and yes, I would love to marry him, he is probably not my favourite in the show. Tanaka, yes the lovable, tea drinking, \"haha\" butler is my favourite. He's sounds like a scholar, but can't maintain his energy very long. He's that butler who would still serve the family after they become housebroken. He added humour every time he was on screen. And he is so cute! \\n\\n\r\nI really liked the multicultural mix though. There was French, English, American, Indian, Chinese, and probably a few more in there. There needs to be more shows with this kind of multicultural characters! And more cats. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\\n\r\nI...actually enjoyed this show surprisingly. As someone who is very picky with what she watches, I really did like it. Yes, it was a bit boring at the beginning since not a lot was happening and side story after side story was just being thrown at me, but after getting through I found I really did enjoy it...until the end. I'm actually glad there is a second season because the cliffhanger ending is tearing me to pieces. Am I satisfied with it? No. But I guess that's what shows do in finales. I recommend this show...sure! But don't expect it to be purrrrfect. It really needs more cat appearances to be at that level. \\n\\n\r\nI give this show a B or a 78% on the Cat scale. \\n\\n",

My friend got me into it and I have to say that this is one of the best animes I have ever come across.\r\nThe plot is amazing, the episodes run smoothly and link well together. The whole concept behind Ciel's character is deep. Very deep. It moves me inside and I feel a pang of sorrow for him. He is haunted by his past and wants a strong vengeance but nothing that he does troubles his soul which makes it valuable (pure) to his demon butler, Sebastian (I'm sorry if I spoiled anything, I'm trying my best on this review).\r\nHowever, oneof the characters, Lizzie (or Elizabeth if you prefer), really gets on my nerves (please keep in mind that this is my own opinion, don't hate me). She really knows what's best for Ciel (I'm being sarcastic), but I must admit, she really cares for Ciel deep down (as shown in one of the episodes, I don't want to spoil anything for anyone still watching).\\n\\n\r\nI really don't know what else to say. It's absolutely amazing. Yes, it may not be appropriate to all audiences because in ways it is graphic (gory as well). I strongly recommend this (unless you don't like blood, guts and gore...

            "content": "My So-Far review of Kuroshitsuji....\r\nSorry, guys. I wanted to like it- I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE IT.\r\nI am a teenage otaku girl. I watch Hetalia (hence the username) , I watch Shounen such as Hunter x Hunter (a masterpiece... highly recommended) , One Piece, Fullmetal Alchemist. I have seen Shoujo such as Clannad, Kanon, and Anohana. I have seen horror, such as Elfen Lied and Another.\r\nI have seen it all- covered every base, from Yaoi to violent fighting scenes.\r\nBut this... this was not enjoyable for me. \r\nI watched 18 episodes- I couldn't suffer through any more of Ciel's irritating whining, Sebastian's gary-stu perfection, the workers'over-the-top fails (being done over. And over. And over again) . \\n\r\nI am going to be more specific in why I hated this.\\n\\n\r\n~~The Good \\n\r\nThe animation was breathtaking. It was some of the best I have ever seen. The detailed ruffles, the designs for the time period's clothing- it was a treat, honestly. \\n\r\nThe hairstyles- amazing. The faces- amazing (although certain characters tended to look a bit alike). The proportions, the movement, the soft feel that it had while still being insanely intense- it was quite an experience. I absolutely adored it. But nice animation doesn't make a perfect show.\\n\r\nI also liked... ummm.... the dancing. It was pretty nice. \\n\r\nAnd that wraps up the good section :) \\n\\n\r\n~~The Bad\\n\r\nJesus Christ, where the ever-living Hannah do I start. \\n\r\nTo begin- \\n\\n\r\nCIEL PHANTOMHIVE. PERIOD. \\n\r\nFor God's sakes, man, how long can you stay away from Sebastian? You claim that he is annoying and you want to be left alone, yet you're ALWAYS CALLING FOR HIM. \"Sebastian, I want some cakes!\" \"Sebastian, I need you to solve this random mystery that has nothing to do with anything!\" \"Sebastian, I wanna have a party. Make it pretty and make it perfect.\" \"Sebastian, Sebastian, Sebastian!!\" SHUT UP!!! (But the way he dealt with Elizabeth, bringing me to my next topic, brought him some major swag points that he needed. You go, boy.)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, his betrothed. *Facedesk* If you thought Ciel was whiny, then day-yum. This chick is so whiny and bratty that I don't feel like spending my time talking about her. Just... just going to to move on.\\n\\n\r\nYou guys are gonna hate me, but I didn't like Sebastian.\\n\r\nCome on, how Gary-Stu does it get? Demon, check. Perfect, check. Amazing hair, check. Red eyes, check. Does everything perfect, check. Is a butler and does things for girly looking boys, CHECK. Please, just a tiny flaw...\\n\\n\r\nThe staff. Finny, Mey-Rin, and Bard. Sure, their stunts were pretty funny. Their failure to carry out Sebastian's not-so-simple tasks was pretty laughable... the first 5000 times it happened. \\n\r\nDang, man. We get it. The gardener sucks at gardening, Mey-Rin can't pour tea because she's legally blind, and Bard... well, his food is a hazard. They're all clumsy, we get. Just please, make it more rare and change it up from time to time. PLEASE.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, the story. \\n\r\nThe story was all-right. I watched 18 episodes, but nothing really happened with the plot. All I saw was cross dressing 12 year olds, a perfect looking butler guy throwing forks, lots of whining from everyone (except Sebastian because he's just THAT perfect) , short shorts, more cross dressing, and lots of cats.\\n\r\nThe story of Kuroshitsuji season 1 in a nutshell, everyone. Have fun.",

            "content": "O-M-G\u2026. starting this I never ever expected that I was about to watch my most favorite anime of all times! Where to even begin reviewing this show? Prepare yourselves for a LONG review, it can\u2019t be helped!\r\nI don\u2019t know what made me fall so utterly and madly in love with it. It might have been the Victorian-era London scenery, the gloomy, melancholic, weeping like atmosphere that prevailed. The eerie, mystifying, wicked characters, the extremely and utterly beautiful musical score, the exquisite art. What I know is that it was love at first sight.\r\nStory: (10/10)\r\nIn a nutshell the story is about a young boy who suddenlyloses everything and everyone he loves without knowing why. He then makes a contract with a demon in order to search for the people responsible for his disasters. Sounds pretty cool and interesting eh? It surely is!\\n\r\nNow I will be honest and admit that this was the only part of show that just lacked a small bit. Like a few parts in the first arcs felt a little out of place at first. Lots of times I also felt like precious time was wasted in some irrelevant things. BUT\u2026 what comes in the second half of the show definitely covers up for every little misstep on the first half. And truth is that in the end it manages to cover all theholes and connect everything together, even things that at first looked off. In any case, better watch the anime before reading the manga, because the comparison between the two will not let you enjoy the anime as much as you can. \\n\r\nAll in all though, it had everything I wanted to see, from intense action scenes to very touching and painful to watch ones. It brought out all kinds of emotions and managed to create an interesting complexity. As this takes part in England, I loved how they mixed things from the English myths and traditions. It gave a note of proficiency.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: ( 10/10)\\n\r\nThe characters are one of the strongest weapons of this show!\\n\r\nFirst the battler\u2026 on the outside a gentle and sophisticated figure, as the most exquisite English battlers used to be. He seeks perfection in every work he does for his master. His true nature though is that of a demon and that allows him to achieve the most perfect results in everything he does.\\n\r\nDemon\u2026a figure carved in religion as the absolute form of evil, yet this time you get to question the fact. And it is brilliant when you realize you can\u2019t label anything you see as good or bad, right or wrong etc. Such meanings mingle and blend together so much, that you can\u2019t distinguish the borders anymore. The battler\u2019s loyalty to the master will make you question if he might have started to really care about him, or if it\u2019s just pretence. You can never really tell or be at ease knowing about his double nature.\\n\r\nThen it\u2019s the figure of the young master, Ciel. Close your eyes once and only hear his words. Could you ever imagine that in front of you stands a 12 year old boy? What would a normal 12 year old have experienced in this short period of his life? Games, friends, family, love? Ciel\u2019s path doesn\u2019t allow him to live normally, it\u2019s only carved in darkness, pain, anger, and loss. His life forced him to grow mature in contrast to his age. And the fact that he is a noble coming from a rich family makes his fate even more ironic and tragic, in the sense that they couldn't buy him the things he misses the most.\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are equally great, wicked, twisted; they highlight the eeriness of the show. And the other house servants are a happy note being very contradictory to the figure of the battler. But that allows to the viewer one or two relief breaths while watching before diving again to the darkness of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe music was one of the parts that I enjoyed the most. From the very beginning I fell in love with the opening song, both for its music and for its lyrical part which both are so fitting and involve all the essence of Kuroshitsuji. As an addition the animation in th eopening is really profound and it was giving me the chills each time. I never skipped it, not even once. The first ending theme was okay, though it mostly highlighted the funny parts of the show, which was not bad for the first half. As for the second ending theme a simple WOW is all I can think of. Nothing could have fitted better; Kalafina are always making top quality things. As for the background music.. captivating and mystifying are the words that come to my mind. It enhances the whole picture and brings it to a totally new level, conveying every feeling, every situation or underlying hidden meaning. All in all this anime has one of the best, if not the very best, music scores of all times.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nAh! This was surely an eye candy! Every character was drawn in detail with every feeling conveyed sometimes just by their eyes, which I found extremely captivating. And I will think of all praise possible for the drawing of the backgrounds. Now not only did they convey the misty atmosphere and dark feeling with some pale, cold and gloomy shades, but also they did study every little detail, from the cutlery, crockery to the inside and outside of that era\u2019s buildings. Being an architect student, what impressed me the most was around the middle of the series, when they drew the building of Crystal Palace. I was totally impressed seeing it in perfect design, which  showed me that the creators had searched so thoroughly before making anything and now that says a lot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (infinite\u2026+\u221e)\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say that I haven\u2019t said already? For all the reasons I have stated this was a pure delight that filled my free time with great moments!\\n\r\nAll the characters\u2019 interactions, the deep and thick plot, the superb art and music, blended together and made a true masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly think that a light or uncaring approach for Kuroshitsuji might just be a failed attempt to keep in track with the underlying levels it possesses. And that\u2019s just the beauty that it holds, which will make you feel so content if you are able to decipher it. In any case it\u2019s filled with greatness!\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I first watched Black Butler, I was like 10/10 AMAZING OHHHH but then i went back and rewatched some episodes and I was like damn... it's not as good as it seems.\r\nI mean, I loved watching Kuroshitsuji. It is definitely not the worst anime I've seen, (the worst anime I've seen is Diabolik Lovers, BARFS, i refuse to even put that on my list, that's how bad it is), however there are some big flaws that need to be pointed out.\r\nBefore I get to that, I'll give you the main idea of the anime.\r\nSTORY\r\nOur setting is Victorian Europe.\r\nSo there's this kid named Ciel Phantomhive,who's parents die in a fire that took his whole mansion at the age of 10. A demon comes to him, Sebastian, and gives him an offer; Sebastian would help Ciel get his revenge on the many who took part in killing his parents, and when Ciel was completely satisfied with his revenge, Sebastian would eat Ciel's soul. Sebastian would also protect him through thick and thin, and be his loyal Butler. Ciel is engulfed in his hatred for those who killed his precious parents, and his dog. He accepts this offer, and this anime is about Ciel, known as \"The Queen's Guard Dog\" because of his devotion to her majesty. They solve a lot of mysteries throughout this first season.\\n\\n\r\nBLACK BUTLER PROS:\\n\r\n   it's really easy to get attached to Ciel. I've met some that think he's just a brat, but he really does go through character development. Sebastian doesn't; he's a demon. But he does have a personality, and it's easy to see that Sebastian differs from other demons (however only in Kuroshitsuji II, which you can only watch after watching the first season, duh.) It was, at least for me, an enjoyable series. I can see NEW anime fans being obsessed with this, so if you're new to anime, I recommend this series, probably in the top 3 anime i'd tell new people to watch.\\n\r\n To be honest... I can't really think of anything else. The series has good characters, (the only GREAT character, when it comes to development, is Ciel, maybe Elizabeth who you'll find out about when watching.)\\n\\n\r\nEnglish Dub\\n\r\nReally good, I do remember a major problem with it in the first episode, but that's about it. It was just a minor mistake, but in the rest of the series i really enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nJapanese w/sub\\n\r\nI watched the series in dub...\\n\\n\r\nBLACK BUTLER CONS\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all... humor. The humor in this series, in my opinion, wasn't executed well at all. There were barely any serious moments that weren't interrupted by comedy. Don't get me wrong, it's ok to install comedy relief once in a while to make things flow, but dang... almost every damn serious scene is paused abruptly by things that sometimes aren't funny at all. LET SERIOUS MOMENTS BE SERIOUS MOMENTS!\\n\\n\r\nSecond... animation. It wasn't HORRIBLE, but it wasn't spectacular either. It was good. I do admire the design for Ciel's character, but that's about it. The rest is just average. I would've enjoyed it much more if it was visually appealing. \\n\\n\r\nI mean... SO MUCH POTENTIAL wasted with this first season. They could have done so much more... more development... better animation... the chance was there. They didn't take it, and what a shame.\\n\\n\r\nBye :>\\n\r\n- Mirai\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji, or Black Butler (which is what I'm going to call it for the review) is a great example of why you shouldn't place a pussy in the cutting room floor; because when you do so they're too afraid to cut anything out and you end up with a bunch of unnecessary bullshit. I swear, if Black Butler was half the length and more concise it could actually have earned the amount of praise it gets. However, since it's more lose than a contortionist\u2019s bowel movement and longer than it needs to be, it's a crappy series.\r\nThe story revolves around Ciel Phantomhive and his plotfor revenge against the people who killed his parents with the help of his Demon, Sebastian. This would make for an interesting story, but, thanks to the poor editing job I mentioned earlier, it's as appealing as a pile of rotting meat and just about as easy to swallow. It presents a whole mess of stories that may or may not relate to the overarching plot, and everything in it is all is made-up on the spot with hardly a sense of coherence or continuity. Episode 16 is a self-contained story that does nothing for anything in the series. It just wastes an episode. A coherent narrative is there at times, but not enough to make it good. The reason I say that it would be better if it were shorter is because some of the stories are at least interesting, and in the case of some of the better episodes, is relevant to the plot. I genuinely liked episode 21 because it expands on the servants that Ciel hires beyond their normal quirky selves. Although, it should have been early in the series in order for it to make more sense and not just like something they pulled out of their ass to foreshadow future episodes. That's a good example of how organization can hinder something.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as they pulled the story out of their ass, they also pulled many MANY elements of the story out of their ass as well. The mythology in the show is never explained beyond the establishing factor. Reapers hate demons, demons can do anything, and a third example I would provide, but it is spoiler-y, so I cannot. It's not the mythology that's poorly thrown together either, character relationships, major plot points, even the historic elements get poorly assembled in order to create a story. I don't mind if demons exist in a realistic world, but if it is supposed to be a realistic setting than you cannot just forge history because we've already accepted demons. If it's important to the plot than it's alright, but there is no reason to make up history for the real world that has nothing to do with the plot at hand, when there is already history for said world that has nothing to do with the plot at hand. It's like if I made a series that takes place during the real WWII, not a fictional one mind you, that involved ghosts but said that The Prime Minister of Great Britain was Mr. T instead of Winston Churchill, it's factually inaccurate. Unless it's important to the story, and they can explain it well, Mr. T as Prime Minister would be wrong.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as much as I hate the story, there are some nice story elements to it. The whole revenge plot, while done before, is still nice to see, and it gets interesting. That is, until they start pulling shit out of their ass again. We also see a lack of editing again, where the revenge plot is nice, but it takes 17 EPISODES to get the story actually going, and everything else before that is just filler, some of which is good, but all of which has no effect on the story. Still, some of it is pretty alright, and could have made for a better anime, but Black Butler just fails in execution very hard because someone in the cutting room floor thought it was necessary to delay the story in favor of doing pointless bullshit.  It doesn\u2019t even have the excuse of world-building either, because each episode or arc has a story, it just has nothing to do with the overarching story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Black Butler are a bit better than the story, although in that it shoots itself in the foot. It has a slew of interesting, if one-dimensional, characters at its hand and who are the main characters of the show? The two most dull and annoying characters they have. Ciel is just a whiny arrogant bitch, and Sebastian is a God-Mode Stu whose job in the series is to take the suspense out of everything. Literally, he is shown doing impossible things, even for a demon with super-powers. A battle early in the series is between him and a giant wolf creature who can breathe fire, which could have been an interesting life or death situation, but Sebastian does it like it\u2019s no problem. He never struggles with anything; he always just does everything perfectly, which makes that his imperfection ironically. If there\u2019s a need to kill any suspenseful moment or ruin any plot twist that might be interesting, Sebastian is your go-to guy. As for Ciel, mostly he\u2019s a whiny bitch who is arrogant and that\u2019s not really a character that the series can run on. Sure, he has his reasons for it, but he\u2019s just so one-dimensional that it hurt. I know he\u2019s suppressing his emotions, but if he could express any other emotion when he\u2019s alone, or in a situation that can allow it than he might be more likeable. Fortunately, he does get character development, AFTER 22 EPISODES! Again, that\u2019s a problem with the editing. Back on track, his character development is actually interesting. It all starts when he loses Sebastian and has to find his way back home, because without his butler by his side he can\u2019t defend himself and no one considers him to be as rich as he is. On his quest home, he learns thing about himself and becomes more likeable. As for the rest of the characters, aside from the main villain of the show, they\u2019re all quite nicely varied and interesting in their own ways. Sure, they might be one-dimensional, but they\u2019re all tolerable dimensions, if you can understand that logic.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve heard people praise the animation, even people who think it\u2019s worse that I think it is, but I do have a few problems with it. It\u2019s torn between wanting to copy the animation for Ouran and wanting to copy the animation for Hellsing, and they often mix and match the two styles in instances where one style is needed. Both Ouran and Hellsing have great animation, but when you switch them up as often as they do in this, both styles lose their charm after a while, and the impact is lost. The impression that it leaves is a sort of \u201cplease pay attention to us\u201d vibe that wants to draw viewers in, rather than create a decent tone with its art. One other major problem I have with the art is that whenever they have a close-up of Sebastian\u2019s face he almost always has a really dumb expression on it. It really takes the \u201cserious badass\u201d aspect he\u2019s supposed to have, if the who \u201ctoo perfect\u201d thing didn\u2019t do it first. Still, the art is nice to look at, even if it\u2019s not all that original, and the character designs are pretty nice on a good number of characters, but it\u2019s not as great as some people make it out to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty cool. The opening and both endings are good to listen to, and the background music is very interesting and tries to create a nice tone, which the story immediately ruins. Still, it\u2019s not that great of a redeeming quality, because Black Butler has a lot of quality it needs to redeem; like the dub, for instance. It\u2019s not a bad dub, per say, but when compared to the subbed version, it is just laughable. Most of the subbed voices actually make the characters sound cooler than their dubbed counterparts. Even Sebastian, which I didn\u2019t think was possible. The sound quality of the show though, is generally pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, there is one more thing I\u2019d like to address. Even though I say these bad things about the series, I would recommend that you watch it anyway. \u201cWhy?\u201d you may ask; because all these bad points make it incredibly funny to watch. It\u2019s not the best at pulling of \u201cit\u2019s so bad it\u2019s good\u201d because I admit, there are good bits, and there are some bad parts that are just bad, but it is somewhat fun to watch, and if you approach it with the right attitude, it will go by quickly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Black Butler is a very flawed, yet very fun ride. Some of the things are good, and some of the things will make you bang your head against the desk. The non-main characters are mostly fun and enjoyable, and the production value is pretty good, but nowhere near the best out of a series. It\u2019s a very cheesy show and you could probably milk it for all it\u2019s worth by making fun of it, but if you go in expecting a very serious story, than you will be thoroughly disappointed. 5/10\\n",

My crush on Sebastian Michaelis was the reason which pushed me into anime, and I will forever be grateful to Kuro for that.\r\nSurprised to see so many positive reviews; thought there would be more criticisms. Anyway, set in Victorian London, the anime is a visual delight. It does lack in quality from time to time, and the plot is all over the place (it begins with Sherlock style episodes and then quickly forgets about solving crimes and abruptly startsfocusing on other issues). It is also NEVER explored why someone like Ciel would ever be the Queen's guard dog. His personality is pretty much the opposite of that. I also don't like how annoying Elizabeth is portrayed to be, when in reality she's a complete badass.\\n\\n\r\nThe highlight of the series for me (as is with 99% of its fans) was Sebastian. Then there's the very cute (but bratty) Ciel, Seb's relationship with Ciel, Grell and even William. Hahaha. Bassy's sass is to die for. Kuro only shines in bits and pieces, but who cares? Michaelis more than makes up for every flaw in the series.",

            "content": "\"Black Butler\" is a modernized, Victorian version of Faust. ...seriously.\r\nThe story itself is derived from \"Doctor Faustus\" and the whole idea of the Faustian bargain, but it's generally very-well adapted into the Victorian setting. The first 10 or so episodes are rather good, but things drop in clarity and get more confusing as the episodes progress. By the end, some things are tied up together well, while others are left in shambles.\r\nCharacter wise, Sebastian completely steals the show. With his mysterious persona, [seemingly] nice attitude and good looks (oh lordy), he's totally the centerpiece. Ciel can be annoying at times, but he is after all\"only a child.\" I would have liked to see more development of the secondary and supporting characters, for they felt rather one-dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nArt quality is very good, especially when it comes to the action sequences. OP and both EDs are very enjoyable. The English dub is quite excellent. The Victorian-style soundtrack really adds to the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching \"Black Butler,\" despite the gripes I have with it regarding plot. It apparently deviates from the manga after the first arc or so, but seems good as a stand-alone watch.",

            "content": "Critic's Log - Earthdate: April 5, 2013. Review #44: Black Butler (Kuroshitsuji)\r\nGreetings Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to properly introduce myself. My name is Giovanni and I will honor whatever requests you give me regarding what animes to see. I will also review what is requested because I want to honor your requests and be of valuable service to you while I review the specific anime you requested. I will try to be perfectly honest in what I think of the anime I'm reviewing and I will analyze it to the best of my knowledge. A while back, my fair master has requested thatI review an anime called \"Kuroshitsu., uh... Kurohitsu...No... Kurotsuji...*Ahem* Pardon me, I cannot pronounce it, why don't I just call it \"Black Butler\" Ah yes, now that was simpler for me to say. I shall honor my master's request because you see, I am simply one hell of a critic. , Would you care for a cup of tea while I review Black Butler?\\n\\n\r\nOne of the noble families of England known as Phantomhive has one hell of a butler named Sebastian Michaelis. He has unquestionably perfect knowledge, he is well mannered, and he is talented with materials, martial arts and much more. But for some reason, he serves a 12-year-old noble boy named Ciel Phantomhive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo be technical, this is a A-1 Pictures production and the animation is damn gorgeous in this show and it doesn't disappoint. There are a couple bumps in the road in the progression of Black Butler but it does merit the acknowledgement of having good animation. They would later be responsible for the animation of popular titles such as Fairy Tail and a hugely popular recent anime called Sword Art Online. I'll get to those animes eventually. The animation is Black Butler's strong suit. What does impress me about the animation in the show is how well detailed this show looks. The backgrounds, the sceneries, and even some effects are animated and detailed gorgeously. So Black Butler is good for this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music for Black Butler is done by Taku Iwasaki. I know I might be stretching this a little for saying this, but... I find Iwasaki-san to be the male equivalent to Yoko Kanno. I actually find him to be extremely talented in the music department when it comes to Anime. Look up his career and I'll bet you'll be surprised on what he has worked before and since Black Butler. I know Yoko Kanno is extremely popular in the community of anime fans, but I do think some of her stuff may have sound too similar to certain musical compositions or songs while Iwasaki-san sounds mostly original. But I'll just say that whatever Yoko Kanno produces sometimes may just be homages to something she's heard. A bonus for me is that he shares the same birthday as I do. I am getting off subject, am I? Anyway, Iwasaki-san's score really fits the show because the music sounds like it is used in the right era that the music is supposed to be based on. I like the Orchestral sounds that Taku Iwasaki inserted into the show, and Orchestral tends to be epic music even though Black Butler isn't necessarily epic, but it does give a nice touch for Black Butler. It makes the show more elegant and I think that's what the intent of the show was aiming for and it sure hit the chords well. The score isn't perfect though but it's still worth listening to. I will say that the opening is catchy and both closing themes are great too.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to voice acting, let me make this clear... This show is extremely fitting and superb in the English dub because of the fact it is set in England. But to the credit of the original Japanese cast, they must be mentioned too because the original Japanese case is superb as well. Daisuke Ono was terrific as Sebastian and he plays the role elegantly. Also, another seiyu worth mentioning is the voice of Ciel Phantomhive which is played so damn well by Maaya Sakamoto. Out of all the roles Sakamoto-san has played, Ciel Phantomhive is probably a character she was picked to voice beyond her call of duty. I have never heard her play a male role, especially a 12 year old and make it sound nothing like her (for the most part). What I can say is...is that her performance as Ciel Phantomhive is terrific and definitely worth noting about. Jun Fukuyama is also in this show and he plays the lovely Grell Sutcliff. Other worthy seiyus would include Junichi Suwabe as the Undertaker, and Romi Park as Madam Red. On the side of the English Dub, J. Michael Tatum proves that he is one hell of a voice actor in his role as Sebastian (Can I stop using the \"One hell of a...\" phrase?) He really nails Sebastian in the dub. Brina Palencia is also pretty good as Ciel Phantomhive. Daniel Frederick is terrific as Grell Sutcliff and I hope to hear more of his stuff. He's very underappreciated. The other Voice Actors and Voice Actresses that are worth mentioning would have to be Chuck Huber as Ashe, Colleen Clickenbeard as Angela, Ian Sinclair as Baldroy, Jerry Jewell as Lau, and Lydia Mackay as Madam Red. The only characters I had a bit of a problem was John Swasey as The Undertaker, it didn't really have the same charm that his Seiyu counterpart had. Also, there's Monica Rial's slightly ear-grating voice as Mey-Rin, although to Monica Rial's credit, she wasn't terrible in this show and she's not a bad voice actress. They could've done something a little different for Mey-Rin's voice for the dub. The Japanese cast is superb and so is the Dub. This is really a show that can be seen in both versions. Colleen Clickenbeard did pretty good as ADR director from the first episode to the seventh, that is until Ian Sinclair took her place for the remainder of the show for reasons I don't know why but I can tell you this is that their ADR directing led to Black Butler having... you guessed it! One hell of a dub.\\n\\n\r\n*My phone rings*\\n\\n\r\nMe: Yes, Master?\\n\\n\r\nMy Master: Excellent work.\\n\\n\r\nMe: Many thanks Master. Is there anything you need?\\n\\n\r\nMy Master: I am perfectly fine, I am just overseeing your progress.\\n\\n\r\nMe: I assure you everything is going according to plan.\\n\\n\r\nMy Master: Good, then finish your task and then report back to me.\\n\\n\r\nMe: Yes, my lord. It shall be done\\n\\n\r\n*Conversation ends*\\n\\n\r\nMy apologies, my master just wanted to check in on my progress with the task of reviewing this anime, shall we continue?\\n\\n\r\nIf there are any problems with the show, First off are the characters. Most of them seem a little underdeveloped and some minor characters are a bit interesting too. That's pretty much that. Sebastian is pretty cool but he isn't developed well as I hoped he would. He does get interesting near the end of the first season of Black Butler. Ciel on the other hand is actually interesting and developed pretty well for the most part. All the other butlers such as Mey-Rin, Baldroy, Tanaka are also fun to watch but not developed fully. But to Black Butler's credit, the characters were never boring and they were in fact fun to watch, it's just Black Butler suffers with some poor character development. The Villians are okay and somewhat interesting too but they have the same issues has some of the other characters that I also mentioned. It's a take it or leave it thing regarding characters for this show. Also, there's Grell Sutcliff. He surprisingly develops pretty well for the most part and let's face it... Without him, this show would have been somewhat boring. He really brings fun on the silver platter. Grell really puts the Ho...um...uh... Let me try to re-phrase this, uh... ah yes, he puts the Homicidal maniac character type to good use, even if he isn't evil. I almost slipped out a gay slur that could offend someone in the LGBT community and I decided not to say it. Please know that I've seen plenty of pictures where people have said that Grell puts the \"Homo\" in homicidal maniac, it was just an example. Ah screw it, please forgive me for saying all of this. One minor nitpick is that Black Butler has a slightly similar premise to Hellsing. Except Sebastian is nowhere as delightfully fun to watch as Alucard. I don't think Black Butler heavily ripped off Hellsing but I do see just one shard of similarity between the two. I take that back, they are both set in England as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big issue I have with the show is the story. Albeit of the fact that there is a mystery that does get brought up often. Ciel's character arc is pretty good, but there is a part of the show where they somehow reveal the Queen of England's dark shadow which I thought was a little interesting even though it was a bit farfetched. The show does get a bit interesting from time to time but you have to be really patient until the story does pick up. The thing that strikes me about Black Butler is that it does seem to be a decent anime but I have a hard time admitting this. This is actually a somewhat above average series. Sure, Black Butler has some underdeveloped characters and an average story but what really shines is the animation and the music. Half the show is elegantly handled. So I guess it is sort of cheating that the show is good for having a fitting soundtrack and great animation while the problems are the story and characters which are essential to a fictional work. I may like this show but I don't like it the same way as some people do. Believe it or not, you really have to see this show. If you just want good animation, you've come to the right place, if you are looking for a great story with great characters, you might have to look somewhere else, but regardless... you have to at least check this out to see whether you're invested in the show or not. I am looking forward to the second season of Black Butler, but until then. I bid you adieu...\\n\\n\r\nBlack Butler is available from Funimation, The manga by Yana Toboso is available by Yen Press.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, Black Butler may not meet up to your expectations but it does have great animation and a soundtrack that is mostly pleasant. It may not have a fully intriguing story and it may not have fully developed characters on this silver platter for your exquisite tastes but I can promise you that if you are looking for an anime to pass the time, you really should take a taste-test for this elegant treat.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI give Black Butler a 7.7 out of 10, it is GOOD!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to comment below, now if you'll excuse me.., I must report to my master that my task is finished. Farewell for now",

            "content": "When this series first aired on Japanese TV, I was not intrested in it. I kept seeing images of the main charachter Sebastian and thought he was a rip of Mukuro Rokudo of Katekyo Hitman Reborn, so I dicided to sit down and see if the show was worth all the hollabo. I became hooked and this is a anime higly ranked in my book. When I went to anime club, I recamended this show to all the girls. I cant wait for season 2. 24 episodes dosent seem enough for this awsome anime.\r\nThe animmation may not be as buetiful as something made by KyotoAnimation, but it was lovley. The soundtrack fit each scene perfectly. I like how they played opera music while Sebastian throws kitchen knives killing the mafisos in the second ep. If you like blood this anime has plenty of it just not buckets like Elfen Lied. This show is also hillarious, I did not think it was a comedy at first, boy I practly woke up my family laughing while watching the show late at night. You will also love the charachters, Sebastian is the butler, the rensiance man, and the demon. He is one hell of a butler like he always says. Ciel is the master and a cutie, Elezibith is his cute and crazy fiance, Grell is the phyco shinagami who has the hotts for Sebastian. With a cast like this, how could you hate this anime. \\n\r\nPROS- bishie boys, laugh out loud humor, nail biting suspence, bloody scenes\\n\r\nCONS- hardly any female charachters, 24 episodes seemed too short\\n\r\nOverall0 two tumbs up, this show is like Hellsing meets Hayte the Combat Bulter, highly recamended, Somebody please license this show. I want it on DVD.\\n\r\nfor more reviews check out\\n\r\nmagicalgirlj.wordpress.com",

            "content": "Thunder's review no.6: Black Butler\r\nWould you sell your soul, your very afterlife for any price? Personally, if I would get my own demon butler in return I would at least consider it. Well, it would certainly be a one hell of a butler but not the one worth dying for.\r\nThe Story\r\nBlack Butler is an anime about a noble boy named Ciel who wants to avenge his dead family, simple goal but circumstances are far from being simple or normal. He made pact with a very charming demon, Sebastian Michaelis. In exchange for Ciel's soul Sebastian not only helps him with his detective work but alsotries to be a perfect butler all the time. The setting is wonderful and classy Victorian England with all hers tea drinking, elegance, arrogant nobility and God save the queen syndrome, overall one of the better settings I've seen in a vast amount of anime. It gave the show original and distinguished feel.\\n\\n\r\nMain plot doesn't actually kicks in before few episodes in, first we are introduced to the short detective arcs that last for a few episodes each. In the meantime we are given informations about mystery surrounding Ciel and Sebastian little by little which I think was fairly well done. Thanks to that despite episodic nature of the show there was still feeling of progress and we knew that there is something more to everything that it seems. Sure, there was some filler stuff thrown in that doesn't needed to be there but overall the plot managed to stay at least decently intriguing all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one main issue that I have with the plot, mixing serious moments with the lighthearted ones. When I started watching Black Butler I expected that I'm getting into dark and mature show but right after dark and mysterious intro I was shocked by amount of typical anime comedy thrown at me right from the start. I wondered if I'm watching the right show but I was. Big, if not biggest part of the few first episodes is filled with a lot of comedy, even extremely cool demon butler happen to run in a room with a deer head on and ruining serious drama ongoing there. I won't say that comedy in this show was bad, because in fact it could be ridiculously fun sometimes(but that's up to personal taste) but there are times for laughs and times when you should be able to reflect about peoples misery and learn something from it. Fortunately it gets better later on and show managed to be pretty serious without completely turning away from its half lighthearted path in the few last episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWhen main plot itself isn't something I would call brilliant or even really good it definitely isn't a complete failure and manages to send certain messages. Is there a difference between \"good\" and \"evil\"? Is it better to lose yourself and live in arrogant lies or suffer and be yourself? Those kind of questions are main and true theme of this anime, too bad that we have to wait for so many episodes to explore them, when they eventually turn up they are rushed and end up not making a lot of sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was quite open ended but despite that it felt like a show was complete, so I was quite surprised when I've heard about the second season. It doesn't feel like this anime is in need of a continuation and honestly I have a bad feeling about its successor.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Animation\\n\r\nOne of the main things that made Black Butler enjoyable to watch was its beautiful art style. Victorian England is beautiful with its distinguished elegance. Backgrounds are beautiful and everything is drowned rather realistically(just a goof or two there and there). Every character, man or women looks well... sexy. I wonder if the whole show isn't made to question my sexual orientation, watching Sebastian and other handsome gentlemen isn't less and maybe even more... primitively satisfying that watching some ecchi harem, even so this fanservice for girls(and some men) isn't to extreme and even if you don't like handsome boys exposing themselves you shouldn't be turn down by it, well I think so but we all know that homophobia is a serious problem nowadays in some parts of the the societies.\\n\\n\r\nAnimations themselves aren't perfect, there are some moments when frame rate isn't as good as it should be but despite that they manege to stay on a very good level, overall good animation and amazing art style.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound\\n\r\nSoundtrack suited both victorian england setting and fantasy feel of the show perfectly. There was great variety of sounds, from the epic choruses to the slow, mysterious and beautiful soundtracks. Both the opening and endings deserve a lot of praise. Opening song stay the same trough the whole show but animations in it change and different song verses are used. It's very good song, yet I wonder if it's text suits the anime as well as soundtrack does or is it just another fanservice thing that should make us fall in love in Sebastian. First ending song is lively and rockie, it's kind of addictive but I think I preferred second ending more because it was both beautiful and serious, those of you that know famous in the anime industry music group named Kalafina should know what I mean. Both main and support voice actors done a very good job. Even Ciel sounds cool, despite being a young boy.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters\\n\r\nOur one hell of a butler Sebastian Michaelis is definitely main selling point of the whole show, actually the show is named after him so that must be saying something. Sebastian posses everything that makes a character likeable, he's mysterious, unique, seems to be kind(we never know), is extremely reliable and what's most important for some, he got a class. There is not denying that Sebastian is one of the most memorable characters I've seen. He steals all the lights and all the looks wherever he is. He doesn't get much of character development but we're waiting for every moment when something new is revealed about him. The only other character that managed to get my attention is the other MC, Ciel Phantomhive. From the beginning he seems to be some arrogant, annoying brat that can't even dress himself without Sebastian. Happily his situation and goals are explained to us very well and he's much more likeable later on. He also gets through some serious character development in the second part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSadly despite Sebastian and Ciel being some pretty outstanding characters, rest of the cast is rather lacking. Well, every character at least seem to have much depth but sadly it just seems that way. Ciel's servants, friends, opponents and relatives are a bunch of two and one dimensional characters that usually have a straightforward goal and a simple personality. For example naive prince, extravagant aristocrat or your typical good cop. Different backstories that different characters posses aren't that bad, actually they are alright and despite being simple, all the characters are somewhat fun to watch, even if only for comedic purposes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment\\n\r\nAll those fun characters, decent enough plot and beautiful art and music makes Black Butler very enjoyable anime. Based on who you are you may even find comedy and fanservice enjoyable but I don't think that this show will appeal to everyone. It's hard to take it too seriously but it doesn't feel right to take it too lightly either. Somewhat I managed to both have some fun and enjoy the story and characters. Black Butler have a unique feel to it and despite comedy parts lessening impact of the serious scenes I don't think that Black Butler would be a show it is right now without them. Maybe it's better to get enjoyable imperfection than some average thriller.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nBlack Butler is overall a show with a unique feel to it, decent plot and unforgettable characters. It have some problems that keep me from calling it truly great but despite its downsides it was one hell of a show, the nice kind of hell.",

            "content": "Note: This review is coming from someone who hasn\u2019t read the manga yet. Also few spoilers here and there so beware!\r\nI am not a fan of shows where people love it because they have hot men or women falling in love with each other, especially with those that have immense popularity such as Attack on Titan, Death Note, any kind of sports anime and any kind of ecchi. When I think of Black Butler (Kuroshitsuji if you prefer the Japanese title) at first, I thought it was one of those shows; in this case stars a sexy butler and a cutesy boy. Good enough forthe ladies to gush over them. However, Black Butler is one of those few fan bait shows that I really love. It\u2019s not because Sebastian is one of the hottest characters that anime has ever had, but because it has a mixture of my favorite genres: historical, mystery and supernatural. And this show does those elements perfectly. Black Butler is part of what I call \u201cThe Historical Mystery Trio\u201d which also consists of Baccano and Gosick (the latter I watched before this and recently made a review of) since they all share a lot of similarities. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8/10\\n\r\nTaking place in a Victorian-era England, Ciel Phantomhive is a young boy who loses everything he loved. He then makes a contract with a demon and asks him to in exchange his soul for revenge. Ciel is now the head of the Phantomhive company, handling all businesses as well as the guard dog for the Queen of England. His new partner is a demon butler, Sebastian Michaelis, whose powers as a butler is overshadowed by his strength as a demon. \\n\r\nA human making a deal/contract with a demon may be an unoriginal idea, but Black Butler makes it fresh by taking place during the 19th century and having a sexy demon butler making a contract with a cute little boy. As for the mystery elements, they do have a lot of surprising twists and turns and they are pretty good despite being less complex than other mystery anime (on the other hand, it is much easier to follow). There\u2019s also the comedy elements. Even though at times it can be going to the wrong tone (from dark to light), they still can be very entertaining. \\n\r\nHowever, one thing I know is that the majority of Black Butler has an anime-original plot which includes the ending for this season. For the people who are reading the manga, they can be either okay or disappointed with this anime adaptation. As for me, I quite enjoyed the whole story even though it mostly does not follow the manga and I do admit that the season's ending was quite perfect. Well, until Mr Trancy and his friends ruin everything. And that's another story.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 8/10\\n\r\nFirst up we have what everyone thinks as one of the hottest anime men ever, Sebastian. A demon butler who is quite a gentleman as well as being a damn badass at house chores! I mean, anyone can hire him for cooking, cleaning and all those housework stuff. That way, doing house chores is way more fun.  No wonder many girls fall in love for him. As much as I love Sebastian, I personally like Ciel more than him. He\u2019s a cute, rich, business boy with an eyepatch, a dark past and can solve mysteries in a go. Even though he may look like a shota bait for Sebby and others. And fun fact, Ciel even shares the same birthday as me! The relationship between Sebastian and Ciel is a strong bond between servant and master. They are one of the best partners in anime. And don\u2019t even think about it ladies!\\n\r\nAs for the supporting characters such as he Phantomhive servants, Lizzy, Grell, Madame Red, the Undertaker, Lau and the Indians, they can be mostly comic reliefs that only shines for comedy purposes. But what makes them pass for being good characters is that they do have some depth to them and have their times to shine in some episodes. For the villains (the Angel) however, they can be forgettable and a bit generic since they are anime original characters. But at the same time, having a split gender is an interesting choice for them.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\r\nBlack Butler was one of the first popular works of A1 Pictures who would later work on popular shows such as Blue Exorcist, Anohana, Magi, Your Lie in April, Seven Deadly Sins, Erased and of course, that show with a crappy black swordsman (SAO fans triggered). It may not be their best work but Black Butler\u2019s animation is nice. It matches the Victorian style perfectly from the settings to the clothing. As for the comedic style animation that anime is known for, it may be a bit out of place for the show\u2019s dark tone. But it is animated quite well. The biggest flaw I have to find with the animation is the CGI carriages. Nothing to say about it other than looking out of place and being poorly animated. Personally, I am not a fan of CGI in anime.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC: 9/10\\n\r\nThe music is done by Taku Iwasaki, who is one of my favorite composers. His soundtrack for Black Butler mostly consists of classical music with sprinkle of rock and jazz. It definitely matches the show. The opening Monochrome no Kiss by SID (one of my favorite Japanese male bands) is pretty damn catchy. The first ending I\u2019m Alive by Becca can be also catchy, but it doesn\u2019t really fit the show. As for the second ending Lacrimosa (cry in Latin), it fits way better than the last one since it\u2019s way darker and has an ominous and haunting tone. In terms of music, this is one of my favorite ending songs. Why? It is composed by my favorite composer Yuki Kajiura and sung by my favorite Japanese band Kalafina. I just love their music so much!\\n\\n\r\nDUB: 8/10\\n\r\nSince this show takes place in the UK, you\u2019ll expect a lot of British accents here and there (and some Italian, French and Indian too). Did Funimation managed to handle them well? Well, mostly. Some performances are quite cringey like Monica Rial's Mey-Rin, Jason Liebrecht's Finny and Chris Ayres' Prince Soma (the last one is Indian btw). But most of the time, they are surprisingly good. J Michael Tatum's Sebastian and Brina Palencia's Ciel was spot on and really great. A perfect casting choice for the two leads. Another great role was Grell voiced by Daniel Fredrick (haven't known him in roles other than this), who matches his creepy, crazy attitude. I may heard from Funimation better, but the dub was still great. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\r\nTo conclude, Black Butler is the one of the best shonen anime I've watched. It may have a plot that can turn off many manga readers, but it's still a fun watch with great characters, entertaining comedy, nice art and awesome music. If you like a good historical mystery anime, Black Butler is for you. \\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n+ A nice twist to the idea of a demon contract\\n\r\n+ The mysteries are quite intriguing\\n\r\n+ Ciel and Sebastian are great leads\\n\r\n+ Great supporting cast\\n\r\n+ Nice Victorian setting\\n\r\n+ Amazing music\\n\r\n+ A surprisingly good dub\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n- Anime-original story line may turn off manga readers\\n\r\n- Comedy at times can be out of place\\n\r\n- Some of the dub's accents can be cringy \\n\r\n- CGI carriages are killing my sight\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWell this is simply one hell of a review! And now, I have Mr Trancy to deal with in the next season. Wish me luck!",

And it was; the first few episodes were interesting, and gave the feel of a dark story. By episode 10, I felt sorry for the characters. \r\nNow, I haven't read the manga, so I don't know when or how the anime deviated, but the frivolous story lines were painful to watch. The supportive characters didn't completely get a chance to shine, while the main character Ceil, was a seriously whiny crutch to the supposedly awesome Sebastian.\r\nThe animationwasn't spectacular either. At times it did improve, like during fighting scenes, but otherwise, there was nothing that made it standout. \\n\\n\r\nNo character development, not much a plot development, and it ended in an obscure and unrewarding way that made me want to cry.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch it because of the manga, go ahead, but it was a huge disappointment for me. \\n",

What will happen to Sebastian?\" Is usually what I think when I'm watching it. There are a few things left behind that are a mystery....... It makes me want to watch more, which usually drives my until about 2:00 am before I tell myself \"Alight, I'm going to bed NOW!\" \r\nWhen you watch it, you keep thinking, \"Who's going to die in this episode?\" or something along those lines.The characters are well developed, that is why it is so easy to make fan-fictions; you understand the characters so well, you know what and how they think. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the fact that there is that slightest touch of romance that just nudges me forward, to keep watching. Black Butler is simply an anime where you just can't walk away from it because you still have so many questions that need answers. \\n\\n\r\nThe art isn't all that bad either. It had good quality sound and always played the perfect background music! \\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen Black Butler, I won't spoil anything for you. I just have to say that I have yet to see someone who has dropped or stopped watching Black Butler. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it for you to watch it. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is just so well thought out that there are simply no words to explain it. Though I wouldn't say it was the best anime of all time, it is definitely worth watching",

            "content": "Of all the anime I have watch, which is probably a lot less than the other people here, but still a large amount to say the least, i'd have to say that Kuroshitsuji is perhaps one of the best in several departments. Although, as a lot of fans i've seen seem to think, I prefer the manga, the anime was something I thoroughly enjoyed. I went into it thinking that it probably wasn't going to be all that good, seeing as I'd never heard anything about it(good or bad), and a friend of mine said they had wanted to watch it as well(and her tastein anime isn't the same as mine), so I figured I was probably going to be bored with the series very fast. I was incredibly wrong.\\n\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji's characters are, to me, very unique and capturing. I'm sure there a lot of anime about pretty little boys and almost insanely handsome demons out there, but something about the personalities of the characters just pulls you in and makes you love each one of them, no matter how annoying they are made to be. One of the two main characters, Ciel Phantomhive(I can't truly call him the main character, as that spot belongs to Sebastian, in my eyes atleast), has a personality that just about everyone would hate in real life but, as I always do, and i'm sure a lot of you are guilty of this too, are drawn to in fiction. His past is, without a doubt, very dark and interesting, which is very heavily involved in the story and plot of the anime, and to me, makes his personality completely understandable. Sebastian's cat-loving character trait never ceases to make people laugh and love him even more, along with his outstanding loyalty to his duties and his general all-around mister handsome demon personality. I don't want to go into depth about it here because, honestly, I think it's something fun to find out through the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of the series could've been better, but to me, it was alright. It doesn't really leave many plotholes and gets involved in Ciel's past very fast. When I was watching Kuroshitsuji, I always looked foreward to the surprises in the story as well--I knew the basic plot and thought that was just about it, but no, it's far more when the story comes into play. There are parts of the story that I never expected and would've never guessed would be there that come out in the series. Overall, it's pretty good, despite the small things that sort of turn me off of it. The large difference between it and the manga sort of bothers me, and the fact that it's so short makes it seem a little rushed.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Kuroshitsuji is by far some of the best art in an anime i've ever seen. I was immediately drawn to it and it was almost always amazing and well done, very fitting to the setting of the series. I never once thought \"ew, they made that look really awkward\" or \"oh god, why does this character's body look so disporportioned?\"--I don't have anything about the art to complain about, really, so i'm keeping this part very short. Outstanding work on the artwork and animation is all i've got to say.\\n\\n\r\nOf all the amazing things in this anime, the music is the loveliest. Always so interesting, fitting to the moment, and beautiful, I absolutely adore the soundtrack. The themesongs and ending songs were very well-chosen and well-animated, along with the background music. Aboslutely OUTSTANDING. I highly doubt you will be disappointed in it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you're debating on whether or not to watch Kuroshitsuji or not, I'd say, go for it. Even if it's not your type of anime, it's a great show--I didn't think it was much of my type, either, and I still thoroughly enjoyed it.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThe plot of Black Butler starts off very episodic; very monster and/or villain of the week, and indeed many episodes are either partially or wholly filler, though even these teach us some interesting things about the characters, so they're worth watching all the same.  Furthermore, some episodes that seem like stand-alone or filler episodes turn out to actually be quite relevant later down the road.  That said, in a relatively short series like this they would have done well to plot the whole business a little tighter than they did, and the main plot doesn't really kick into gear until toward the end.\\n\r\n  That's not to say there aren't some fabulous moments early on: I was hooked on this show by Episode 5, and you'll see why once you watch it.  Also, once things finally get started they proceed at a breakneck pace and pretty much never stop, and the final episodes are stunning, adrenaline pumping stuff.  \\n\r\n  Black Butler has an unusual blend of typically-wacky Japanese comedy and stark, gothic horror, and the juxtaposition of the two may jar some people, but I found that it helped the pacing on the earlier episodes.  The zaniness, for better or for worse, is a lot less common in the later episodes, though not gone entirely.\\n\r\n  The ending however just sort of... happens.  Sad to see yet another otherwise good show with a lackluster ending.  Granted, it's not as bad as the endings for example, of the original Fullmetal Alchemist or Tengen Toppa Gurren Laggan, but it still was rather blase.\\n\\n\r\nShort version:  The story, providing both goofy laughs, thrills and horror is great when it can focus long enough to do its job, but it wanders about far too much for a 24 episode anime.  The ending, sadly, left me cold.  7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nEasily the series' strongest point.  Black Butler is an absolute joy to look at.  The color palette evokes Death Note with its stark blacks and browns highlighted with incandescent reds and blues.  In fact, it even surpasses Death Note in this regard:  While Death Note mainly used bright colors because they were visually striking, Black Butler uses them as a visual shorthand for otherworldliness, and anytime your see a character on this show with bright-colored anime hair, it usually means something is different about them.  \\n\r\n  The animation isn't the smoothest in the world, but everything works quite nicely, and they do a good job with little details like Sebastian cutting a cake, the sort of thing many studios wouldn't bother animating with such care.\\n\\n\r\nShort version: Looks great all around, striking and intelligent use of color.  Animation is intricate and gorgeous though not 100% smooth all the time. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOne of the few anime I watched both subbed and dubbed (not the whole series mind you, just certain episodes) and I have to say that there are excellent things to be said about both.  Bot do an excellent job, and the characters' voices fit them like a glove.  I would have to say I preferred the dub, however.  It really just isn't the same without the English accents.  I mean, I suppose they could have been speaking Japanese with a cockney twang the whole time in the sub, but how would I have known that?\\n\r\n  The opening theme is quite good, pretty much the sort of vaguely sensual melodramatic tune that we've all come to expect from anime of this sort.  The first ending theme is odd, in that it's entirely in English, but it works just fine for its purpose.  The second ending, however, is far more in line with the opening mood-wise, so I have to say I prefer it for that reason alone.\\n\r\n  The music that plays during the actual show is a bit anachronistic at times, but then again, this is a show set in Victorian England in which one character wields a chainsaw, so really the music should be the last thing someone looking to nitpick goes after.  Plus, the music is quite good, and always fits the mood, if not the period.\\n\\n\r\nShort version:  Voice work is excellent in both voicetracks, but the dub edges out the sub due to Britishness.  Music is solid all around. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\n  While many of the characters are underdeveloped, the leads at least get their fair due, and those that are developed properly are highly complex, emotionally-driven characters with motivations that are easy to understand without being overly-simplistic.  Without going into spoiler-filled detail, I can honestly say that it's easy to feel Ciel's pain; his thirst for revenge even though the details of what exactly happened to him aren't fully explained.  Sebastian can say everything he needs to say in a scene with but a look, which is a rare commodity among animated characters.\\n\r\n  There is one supporting character in particular who, while his meaningful screentime was brief, made a strong and memorable impact on the rest of the series and serves as the emotional anchor for the balance of the show.  His character was one of the most enjoyable aspects of the series for me.\\n\r\n  Some characters, however, feel completely superfluous.  One in particular seems to exist solely so the writers could make a series of increasingly over-the-top gay jokes, and he's not nearly entertaining enough to make up for it.  Others, like the other Phantomhive servants, seemed to have a lot of potential that fell by the wayside, and all we ever learn about their pasts are a brief series of flashbacks toward the end of the series.  I honestly would have rather they hung around purely for comic relief than to be given a tiny glimpse into their histories with no follow-through.\\n\\n\r\nShort version:  While the show seems to put most of its creative energies into just a few characters, leaving others to languish, the ones that get their fair share of development are done exceptionally well. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment (Yes, I'm combining these categories.  In my mind there is no difference between the two):\\n\\n\r\nWhile the plot sometimes wanders about like a butler distracted by an adorable cat, it rarely ventures anywhere that's not quite a lot of fun, and I dig the whole wacky/scary mix the show has going.  All the pieces come together in the end to make a satisfactory whole, and I was quite glad I watched Black Butler, all told.\\n\\n\r\n8/10",

Who is trying to get his revenge for who killed his parents. Which is Sebastian's soul purpose in this show.\r\nThis is where it gets interesting.\r\nI realized in the first 10 episodes in this series were really....Slow.\r\nFor instance in ep. 1 You get to meet the characters and the setting time and place and all that. You even get to see a murder happen in place!\r\nThis is where Kuroshitsuji fails.\r\nIt gets so repeitive in its work. For instance, Ciel isthe 'Queen's guard dog.' Which makes Ciel kinda.. 'used' in the story line. Every 5 or so episodes is about him trying to solve a case against someone that has no meaning to the story. Until about episodes 17-25 you will see that that begins to shift.\\n\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji has its fails and its wins.\\n\\n\r\nWins:\\n\\n\r\n-Interesting plot\\n\\n\r\n-Interesting characters\\n\\n\r\n-Many memorable places\\n\\n\r\n-Varied races/classes\\n\\n\\n\r\nFails:\\n\\n\r\n- Repetitive to the bone.\\n\\n\r\n- Slightly bland.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Art style is......okay Its not the best segoi thing i have ever seen in my life.

Which helps more to the story line.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal enjoyment was a factor too. I actually enjoyed watching Kuroshitsuji. (Episode 17 was a bit....rough.)  I would recommend this first season to anyone getting into anime. It has a bit of cliche here and there. But they is potential in the story. Plus the manga has a huge fanbase too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I award Kuroshitsuji a royal 8/10. ... Don't make me get started on the second season...\\n\\n",

            "content": "The major draw of Black Butler is without a doubt the relationship between the wonderfully overpowered Sebastian and hopeless Ciel being. This dynamic remains strong no matter the myriad of situations our two main characters find themselves in, be it the darker ones the show sometimes revels in, or the more lighthearted moments that bring out the best of the show\u2019s fun and absurdness. Black Butler presents itself with a confidence that knows exactly who this show is intended for, but definitely does not restrict itself to a very specific section of potential viewers, if like me that was what you were worried about goinginto the show.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Butlers strongest point is not only Seb and Ciel\u2019s relationship, but how their relationship manages to evolve over the whole 24 episodes. Starting as little more than a master-servant relationship, it becomes obvious how Sebastian cares little for success if Ciel is harmed in the process. Most episodes, in the first half especially, are one-off stories, and often the excitement in the episodes can arise as a result of the conflicting objectives between Seb and Ciel \u2013 Ciel wants the job done, and Seb will only follow Ciel\u2019s orders if there is no possible end result where Ciel is killed. It really serves to tone down how obviously powerful Sebastian is, and how easily he is able to deal with Ciel\u2019s obstacles. Over the course of the anime however, Sebastian\u2019s devilishness becomes more pronounced and Ciel seemingly becomes more and more human and caring as a result \u2013 much to Sebastian\u2019s chagrin. This strong ying-yang nature of the relationship between the two main characters gives them fantastic depth, without a doubt being the most enjoyable aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCountering this unfortunately, the majority of the remaining characters receive very little character development, often existing as a means of comedy delivery. Whilst in certain shows this is not necessarily a bad thing (anime like Gintama do these comedy characters very well) it is when these characters then become crucial to the plot of the shows that their lack of actual character becomes painfully obvious. Black Butler is at its best when it is Seb and Ciel vs this episode\u2019s Big Bad. I would have appreciated fewer of the occasional 2 episodes arcs which try to bring in surrounding characters I have no emotions for, other than anger for stealing the wonderful Ciel x Sebastian screen time. Even the show\u2019s antagonist, without going into too much detail, receives disappointingly little explanation for the motivations behind their actions. Acting only as a threat really to Ciel\u2019s safety (and an excuse for an epic final battle) the antagonist reinforces the impression that the side characters exist as a means to in some way affect the relationship between Seb and Ciel, without really standing on their own two legs.\\n\\n\r\nThis issue I forgive however when some of the aforementioned characters are given the chance to do what they were created for: creating comedic scenarios. When it wants to be, the show can be very funny, especially in comparison with other shounen anime. Sebastian\u2019s teasing personality and sometimes deadpan wit is great fun to watch, and the fact I enjoyed the show a lot is largely down to the comic scenes interspersed between the show\u2019s more serious attempts at plot. Even the antagonist is given the opportunity to have a little fun, delivering classic lines such as: \u2018As a man I will become a ray of light to penetrate you to your core\u2019. If that doesn\u2019t make your nose bleed I don\u2019t know what will.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is noticeably toned down in darker the second half of the series. While this causes the middle of the second half to suffer, the end, as any shounen series with any attempts at a plot should, has a suitably epic conclusion that justifies the weaker middle. For Gen Urobuchi fans out there, when I mean dark, I actually mean pretty bloody dark \u2013 even in the first half, Ciel is taking no prisoners.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s animation is not bad by any means but simply mediocre. Fight scenes suffer as Sebastian seems content to spend his time flying through the air mostly - although it does help to emphasise the overwhelming battle advantage he has, it does make for repetitive viewing. All this I am willing to forgive however in simple appreciation for the obvious effort that went into replicating the 19th century London (writing as a Londoner of course). This attention to detail in the landscape extends to points such as the Tower Bridge depicted as half-finished during the late Victorian era presented in the show, or sentences from English news articles actually being grammatically correct (!). These little details definitely help to make my impression of the show that much better.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED serve their roles as well, my favourite being the second ED by kalafina, also responsible for the Madoka Magica ED. The use of Kalafina music, as was the case with Madoka Magica, does well to indicate the more plot-driven darker direction of the second half of series. The show\u2019s only op is pretty good as well, but unfortunately does not change much over the course of the 24 episodes. On a side note, the animation quality and repeated op give me the impression that the animation studio either didn\u2019t have much money to start with, or spent all their money conducting visits to London for \u2018research purposes\u2019\u2026\\n\\n\r\nBlack Butler tries to be something more than a standard shounen (apart from appealing to fangirls the world over) and while being suitably dark and brooding, it ultimately falls short. I do not think this is necessarily a large stain to the show, as the entertaining finale and good comedy of the show overall still make it one of the better shows the genre has to offer. If shota is without a doubt not the thing for you, you should probably look away now, but for anyone else, Black Butler definitely isn\u2019t just some Boku no Pico with plot.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation:\\n\r\nK-On for the sheer amount of tea being drunk in both shows\u2026\\n\r\nJk, Code Geass actually for the similar sometimes serious, sometimes dark storyline with some epic battles, and main characters both with a strange power bestowed upon them.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let's do this.\r\nI think it'd be fair to say that I fervently dislike this series, as well as Kuroshitsuji II and Book of Circus (I couldn't bring myself to watch Book of Murder), both of which I won't do a review for. Now let's get to the actual review.\r\nI went into this anime having really high hopes for it, as two people I trust recommended it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.\r\nKuroshitsuji, first of all, is loaded with elements meant to attract young females. From the dreamy designs of the characters to the heavily hinted yaoi, it pretty much screams \"FANGIRL BAIT\".\r\nThe story is definitely notcompelling, well-written or well-paced.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is as goes. Ciel is a young nobleman whose parents were murdered in a fire that destroyed his mansion. He was also abused and humiliated by unknown individuals. He wanted to get revenge, so he formed a contract with a demon asking for help with his aim in exchange for his soul. Apart from that, he fulfills his duties as the Queen's watchdog by solving crimes.\\n\\n\r\nHere is the formula of the plot most of the episodes follow:\\n\r\n1. Crime is commited\\n\r\n2. Ciel and Sebastian investigate\\n\r\n3. Ciel gets in trouble\\n\r\n4. Sebastian saves him\\n\r\nAnd there you have it.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains' motives make very little sense and are quite cliche, while the crime stories themselves fail to be engaging. The story jumps from arc to arc with no continuation, and it sort of goes downhill after a certain point. It isn't really memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are bland and lack depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Ciel, is basically just a brooding, whiny brat. His aim is to get revenge for his parents' murder. That's pretty much all there is to say about him. Everything that has to do with his personality is not shown - which would make him have more impact - but rather explained through words, and badly at that. He has no develpoment to speak of.\\n\\n\r\nSebastian is there for three reasons: To be a badass, to attract fangirls and to say his cringeworthy and overused catchphrase, \"I am nothing but a hell of a butler\". He is extremely strong, he is good at everything he does, he is sauve, he has no flaws and no personality whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nGrell... Oh, Grell. So unbelievably annoying. Seriously, his/her sole purpose is to be psychotic and to be attracted to Sebastian. It is my belief that he/she is the representation of all fangirls.\\n\\n\r\nThe three servants of Ciel's, Mey-Rin, Finny and Baldroy are there for comic relief. And sure, they can be considered funny. The first 10 billion times. But when you get to 10 billion and one, it starts to get annoying. We get it; Finny is a terrible gardener, Mey-Rin is a terrible maid, Baldroy is a terrible cook. Is that really the best humour they could come up with?\\n\\n\r\nElizabeth, Ciel's fiancee, is probably one of the most insufferable characters I have ever encountered. Her goal in life is to make everything kawaii to make Ciel happy. You know the type character who has that annoyingly high-pitched voice and is so sickeningly cheerful and upbeat that the moment they open their mouth, you just want them to shut up? Yeah, she's just that.\\n\\n\r\nThe fighting sequences are horrible. Sebastian just uses his vaguely defined physical skills and no strategy. I find battles that require thought to be won much more exciting, so the use of simple force put me off. In addition, the animation is quite sloppy.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style, at least, I really like. I find the settings beautiful and the characters designs very pretty (except for Elizabeth's). The time period in which the story takes place, the Victorian Era, really adds to that.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects, are okay, I guess. I never really notice them. The voice acting is decent in the Japanese dub, although I don't know about the English one. The OST, while not bad, is not particularly memorable except for the opening song.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did not enjoy Kuroshitsuji. Although I suppose if I went into complete fangirl mode it could be considered entertaining.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji was the very reason I began to love anime. While not exactly compelling for it's story, the sound, art, and characters make this anime a truly fascinating watch, and if you haven't already and are thinking about it, I would recommend getting to it ASAP.\r\nStory (7)\r\nCiel Phantomhive is the Queen's underworld guard, who is protected and served by demon Sebastian Michaelis. The story is about Ciel trying to find out who burned his family and to get revenge on the people who did terrible things to him. I wouldn't exactly call the story the reason why I watched this anime, even though it wasgood. There were a few action scenes far and few in-between with relatable humor thrown in here and there at necessary times. \\n\\n\r\nSometimes, the story would slow down in my opinion, but nothing that caused me to drop the anime or put it on pause. However, most of the story is filled with mystery, darkness, and the urge to make you watch more. Even if it does slow down at times, it will pick up.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9)\\n\\n\r\nNothing to complain about here. The dazzling butler Sebastian Michaelis is eye-candy for even the characters in the show, with the background looking amazing in many places and even background characters getting detail, if only in the slightest. The art was one of the things that drew me into the anime, with a beautiful display of dark colors and eerie corridors that fit the theme all too well.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10)\\n\\n\r\nWhere do I start with this one? One of the things that absolutely fascinates me in this anime is the music and the sound effects used. Taking place in Victorian London, the use of violins and pianos are not missing in this anime, used as perfectly as the art to fit the mysterious and dark vibe this anime offers the watcher. The music is really captivating, especially when Sebastian takes the violin and does it himself - it's a masterpiece. I began listening to Victorian music on my free time thanks to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the number one reason I watch this. Every person has either an interesting display of character or a dark, even tragic backstory that can't help but make you sympathize with them. Especially Sebastian and Ciel, the mains in this beautiful show, who are never failing to push you through this anime effortlessly. Each person is voiced well - even in the dub, which I usually don't like as well. I could go on for hours and hours about what is so special about the characters here. The moody Ciel, cute on the outside but dark Sebastian, crazy lunatic Grell Sutcliff, aloof reaper William T. Spears, and even Ash Landers and his doll army. I never found myself hating a single one of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8)\\n\\n\r\nI would have rated the enjoyment slightly higher if it were not for the slow down of several episodes. Watching the humor and appealing characters makes this show enjoyable, however, as I even finished this anime in about two days and went to gobble down the second season as soon as I could, and only to love and drool over this anime for several more months. I'm not kidding - watch this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9)\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, this is a must-watch. I watched this about a year ago and would happily go back to it if I didn't have any other anime to watch at the moment. Go out and try it!\\n\\n",

            "content": "After being apart from the Anime and Manga world for a year and four months, I decided to come back, and the best way to do that was to search for something new and refreshing, something that would make me step out of  my comfort zone when it comes to genres. After reading several reviews, I chose Kuroshitsuji or \"Black Butler\".\r\nI told myself to not expect anything and simply enjoy watching it. It wasn't my kind of story at all \u2014 not even close. However, as soon as I finished watching the first episode, I was already hooked. \r\nFirst of all, the story wasflawless. It's not everyday that you see a twelve-year-old \u2014 thirteen after a couple of episodes \u2014 seeking revenge for the death of his parents and contracting a demon to help him do it. On top of that, add a strange aunt with secret intentions, servants that could kick your ass in half a second and an androgynous Shinigami that likes to complicate things. Although you must know that Kuroshitsuji is a lot more than that.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, it was flawless, and it obviously had a lot of potential, which they used very well. However, in the middle of it all things started getting a little vague. Too many fillers and too little answers to important questions made me forget about the main plot for a while. I have not read the Manga and understand that it is still going, but still can't quite find the reason why the producers would follow the story loyally up until episode five. It made no sense to me. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was actually one of the things that got me into Kuroshitsuji. Like many others, I judge an Anime before-hand by the character's design. Sebastian and Ciel, the main characters of this story, were beautifully drawn. There were little to no scenes in which they faces looked weird. When I read that the events took place in 19th century London I wondered how well they would portray it, and it absolutely exceeded my expectations. Four for you, A-1 Pictures! You go, A-1 Pictures!\\n\\n\r\nUsually, I'm not very fond of Openings and Endings. They bore me after a couple of episodes and I find myself skipping them. However, I absolutely loved every Opening and Ending that they chose to show. I even liked the subtle changes they made to the Opening after episode thirteen. The background music in important scenes was perfect and it suited the atmosphere. It was unique. \\n\\n\r\nVoices were great, too. Sebastian's voice had that little thing to it, that subtle sweetness which, at the same time, reminded you that he was, in fact, a demon, not a caring butler after all. Ciel's voice was my favorite. Being a twelve-year-old, it would be easy to have him had a voice that would annoy you. However, it was innocent and hard at the same time, just as his character. After all, he was still a kid trapped in a dark world.\\n\\n\r\nI waited and waited for an episode  \u2014 or even two \u2014 that could show us more about the background characters, such as the servants or even the Queen. It came, yes, but it was not what I expected. This Anime would have been even much better if all those filler episodes would have been used to explain where did all the characters come from, their hopes, dreams, and opinions as to what was happening around them. \\n\\n\r\nI've seen a lot of people complain about Ciel being a conceited brat. If Ciel were to be a loving and caring young boy, the story would lose all realism and fall into even more plot holes. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as enjoyment goes, I can honestly say I stopped myself from doing important things only to continue watching Kuroshitsuji. Hell yes, I did enjoy it. Even the fillers had a little something that would make me want to continue until the end. I'm not much of a Manga person, but this Anime made me feel such a great deal of things that I think I'm going to start reading just so I can see what other direction can the story go to. I don't regret watching it and I don't see it as a waste of time at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Kuroshitsuji is a great Anime. It can fall sometimes in a boring cycle and make you wonder if you should continue watching, but it always has that something, that doubt that makes you want to keep it up until the end. If you can handle an ending that may not be exactly what you want, then all I have to say is: go watch it. After all... it's just one hell of an Anime.",

            "content": "This review might sound a bit one sides, but I will try my best to balance my view.\r\nThis anime is sooobaaaahhhraaahhhhshiiiiyaaa!\r\nWarning: There might be some Spoilers.\r\nI found out about this anime in an anime store in Taipei, Taiwan. I caught a small preview of Kuroshitsuji: Book of Circus, and I thought it was very interesting and it caught my attention (With the gunfighting and the guy getting owned cuz his men got taken cared of and what not) so I stayed a little whiles to find out what the anime was called and I found out it was Black Butler.\r\nWhen I returned home I journeyedupon my laptop to watch this Black Butler. What I found was a world of SUBARASHI! This plot will take you on a journey of twists and turns when you least expect it. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story:\\n\\n\r\nAs this is my first Mystery anime, and I don't have much experience with reading a lot of mystery novels/manga let alone an anime/movie. Although that is a factor, I find that this story is just so smart and mind fuddling at times, the plot takes you on so many twists and turns that you wouldn't even expect. Despite the storyline being mysterious and cliffhanging, it is also a very dark and tragedy that fell upon Ciel Phantomhive. As he solves the crimes that appear in London, he searches for those who he must enact his revenge on.  Although Anyways, Black Butler focuses on Sebastian helping Ciel Phantomhive solve crimes while helping him achieve his revenge when one day, it lands on the front door of his home. Actually he lands at the footsteps of his enemies (Angela).\\n\\n\r\nThe Art:\\n\\n\r\nI myself find little fault with the art and I find it pretty fitting with the story and the atmosphere, etc. There are sometimes where the art could've been better, in my opinion, the Undertaker/Legendary Shinigami's shop could've been better drawn. Many things that many people might dislike Black Butler for is that it often switches between the comedy style that you see with the workforce (Mey-rin, Finnian, Bardroy, Sebastian, Greill Sutcliffe, etc.) One extremely positive thing about the art that made it a ten was Sebastian's love of homeless cats is priceless, Pluto throwing away the kitty and wanting Sebastian's love in Black Butler. It is SUBARAHSHI! \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy the opening and ending songs, especially BECCA with her I'm Alive as well as Monochorme no kiss, even though some other endings sound a bit satanic, I'm down with the songs man. As for the sound effects, they don't really have any problems that I see. One thing that I personally didn't really like but liked at the same time, the way Sebastian says \"Yes, My Lord.\".\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters:\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, they didn't really explain anything too detailed about the characters, only some of the basics. As the plot goes on, Regardless of his tainted past(torture, etc,), his parent's deaths, and the future that awaits him, Ciel Phantomhive truly fights headstrong against those who oppose him. This chance that Ciel Phantomhive seized was given to him by Sebastian in order for him to eat his soul, but despite that fact this seems to me as a representation of hope in a hopeless situation. Many of the servants were also in very crappy situations before they went working for Sebastians, as you see later on in the anime. They were also stuck in a hopeless and sad situation and was given a second chance by Sebastian and was sent to work in a place they enjoyed. Maybe this anime represents that out of darkness there will always be hope, and maybe in Ciel's case and out of that hope will be a demon to consume your soul after you enact your revenge.\\n\\n\r\nMy Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nSUBARAHSHI\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found it very enjoyable especially watching Sebastian love those cats.",

This is a charming, rather dark story about a child with lost innocence yet a pure soul.  If that makes any sense at all. Anyway, the art style was amazing, and the characters oh so charming. The title theme was catchy and I found myself mumbling it under my breath when I wasn't watching it.There were serious moments, and there were moments when you laughed out loud, and there were moments when you really questioned your decision to watch this show, but at the same time you wereso sucked in that you just didn't care.\\n\\n\r\nNow, some flaws to point out. There were episodes that were incredibly insignificant. Yes, they were funny and enjoyable, and I have no complaints that they were there in the first place. However, in the grand scheme of things, it hindered the storyline quite a bit. Also, there were moments that obviously only catered to the fangirls, but the moments were few and far between, and I didn't notice them until I watched a second time. In other words, you don't notice until you start looking.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a very enjoyable anime. I have trouble finding little jewels like this anime nowadays, with wonderful art style, little to no sexualized characters, lovable and memorable characters... that's a tall order to fulfill. And Kuroshitsuji has all that to offer and more. This anime is definitely worth your time if you're hungry for a supernatural, charming, show.",

The storyline is captivating and draws the viewer into it, making you as a viewer feel the emotions that might be running through the characters mind at that very moment. The art is fantastic and beautifully drawn. It was hard for me not to fall in love with the characters as the story progressed. It drew a lot of emotions out of me at the same time. I instantly fell in love with the idea and not even 1/4 of the way through the anime I hadalready thought of it as a 10/10. Which it did not disappoint in the end. If you like animes that are dark/slightly morbid with a suprnatural twist, you'll love Kuroshitsuji.",

            "content": "Everyone makes it sound like Kuroshitsuji is the anime you HAVE to watch - the anime that you ABSOLUTELY CANNOT miss. Whether it's fangirls fawning over Sebastian Michaelis, or fanboys debating Ciel's sanity and maturity, there certainly has been a hell of a lot of reputation this one has packed up, huh? And, through my watching of this - my first anime, actually, but it's been over a year - I could certainly see why!\r\nBut haha... It's not perfect in any way. In fact, sometimes I wonder why people claim Kuroshitsiju to be such a wonderful anime. In my opinion, it's originality and style ispretty average, since there have certainly been some revenge and demon animes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, however, it's not a bad runthrough, but if you didn't like the first Kuro, then don't even bother with the second season, because it's twice as bad. Personally, I, however, enjoyed it, but looking at it in a critique's eye says otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji's story actually isn't all that interesting - just another revenge anime that adds a few unique twists with the Victorian setting and 13-year-old Earl of the Phantomhives. Sure, a few nasty plot curves change the overall ending of this revenge story, but that doesn't change the fact that it is STILL a revenge story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOne reason I rather found myself enjoying this anime was the art style and animation. Kuroshitsuji uses a gloomier palette on most occasions, setting a mysterious, dark mood on eerie moments. For the majority of the first Season, this creepy setting was used, and it helped add to the suspense. Not only that, but it was downright gorgeous in delivery!\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters - Sebastian Michaelis and Ciel Phantomhive - were pretty consistent in terms of art style and design. However, Ciel's eyes could often be oddly proportioned on his face, although that may just be me.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nSince Kuroshitsuji takes place in such a time era, it was appropriate that the music style fit in well with the setting. In my opinion, Kuroshitsuji didn't fail on this part - in fact, they nailed it. All of the soundtracks were incredibly engaging and on point. In particular, it had a few very memorable soundtracks that sounded like it came straight from Victorian London. Being a Victorian nerd in that way, it pleased me to see how much dedication went into the music through this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis was another one of the biggest reasons I ever started watching this. All of the characters that were introduced from early on in this anime - granted, it doesn't have an extraordinarily big cast - were developed in an interesting and unique way. Both Ciel and Sebastian were layered characters that revealed two completely different takes on cruelty and darkness: Ciel withholds silent malice while Sebastian is an obvious demon to be reckoned - even the Manor Servants are obviously intimidated by the Butler, despite knowing what he truly is.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this anime also had its ridiculous share of annoying characters. Pluto - the stupid dog from early in the anime, Elizabeth or \"Lizzy\" - Ciel's cousin/fiance, and the servants themselves. Pluto, the Demon Hound, not originating from the manga, was basically a replica of a Sebastian fangirl that wasn't incredibly plot-important. He should never have existed, in my opinion. Lizzy, on the other hand, had a bit too much enthusiasm, and I do sympathize on her part of being a young girl - but she is completely ignorant of Ciel's obvious distaste to her. And the servants, the cook, the gardener, and the maid: are physically incapable people that fail on the most simple of tasks and make fools of themselves so that the fantastic Demon Butler Sebastian could shine in front of the audience time and time again and win the attention of everyone in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji, given the uninteresting story and somewhat bland side characters, was a thrilling watch as we unwrapped the secrets behind Ciel's past. The character interactions were entertaining enough, granted that mostly happened between Sebastian and Ciel. However, a lot of the episodes were slow and many were irrelevant to the plot. \\n\\n\r\nTowards the middle of the anime, things slowed down a bit and many parts were uninteresting - for example, when Ciel was separated from Sebastian and forced to work with that news reporter, whoever he is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap things up, is Kuroshitsuji a good anime like everyone claims? Definitely. Is it a fantastic anime that needs to be sent tribute and praised by the Sebastian fangirls? Definitely not. While this anime is a good mystery/revenge story that could definitely use a hit, it's not as moving or powerful as everyone claims it to be.\\n\\n\r\nNow, that may be only my opinion, but it is still a far cry from amazing or perfect. Anyone that rated this as a '10' is obviously a Sebastian fangirl, because there are definitely a few things wrong with this anime that should be considered.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Ciel acting immaturely at the weirdest times IS one of them.",

            "content": "[STORY: 5/10]\r\nWhile maybe a small chunk of this show fits with the canon of the manga, it falters away from this for a majority of the runtime. This wouldn't be bad if it was quality writing, but you can definitely feel a sudden shift in quality during the later episodes where they had no more material to translate into animation. Not nearly as tragic as its sequel, though. This is a shame, as there are pretty interesting themes that get washed away as the filler settles in.\r\n[ART: 7/10]\r\nThe art is well done and there are good character designs. If this show has one thing goingfor it, its the animation quality.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND: 5/10]\\n\r\nQuality music and passable voice actors, at least for the sub. Nothing really stands out in this department, however. It just fills the quota it has to fill.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER: 5/10]\\n\r\nThere is enjoyable character development that takes place in \"Kuroshitsuji\". Does it last all throughout the piece? I wish it did. While most of the characters aren't amazing and don't change much throughout the show, the main two, Sebastian and Ciel, do have this interesting and pretty unique dynamic and development that gets a downgrade once the canon material is disregarded. It may not be as bad as its sequel, but its bad enough to take the series into the downward spiral in quality that it barely escapes with \"The Book of Circus\". There are great character designs as I stated earlier, but mostly just for the main characters.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 5/10]\\n\r\nWhile it looked promising at first, \"Kuroshitsuji\" goes downhill pretty fast. The obvious reason for this is the plague of filler that washes over this product and steers it towards disaster. It couldn't be of the same quality as the original Fullmetal Alchemist's filler, but at least it didn't reach the depths of hell that Naruto filler comes from. This show would only be worth watching if you want context for future shows, such as \"The Book of Circus\" or \"The Book of Murder\", because \"Kuroshitsuji II\" is definitely not a reason to watch this prequel. Watch at your own discretion.",

Anyway, if you knowme well enough is that I\u2019m willing to watch something like this with an open mind when I have the time and luckily, this is that time.\\n\\n\r\nIn Victorian-era London, on the night of Ciel Phantomhive's tenth birthday a fire destroyed his manor and killed both of his parents. In a moment of death Ceil strikes a deal with a demon, his soul in exchange for revenge. This demon becomes his butler and calls himself by name of Sebastian Michaelis, to protect and serve Ciel until the deal has been completed. One month after the fire Ciel returns from being missing, with his new butler Sebastian. Ceil is now the head of the Phantomhive corporation, handling all business affairs as well as the work as the Queen of England\u2019s guard dog and looking for his parents murders. One of the noble families of England\u2014Phantomhive\u2014has a butler, Sebastian Michaelis. He has unquestionably perfect knowledge, manners, talent with materials, martial arts and much more. But for some reason, he serves a 12-year-old master...\\n\\n\r\nWell, for the story of it, the plot really doesn\u2019t kick in until a few episodes into the show and you do sense the dark and mature tone of the show from the looks of it along with the hilarity that can sometimes gel into it, but that\u2019s if it works and when it doesn\u2019t, it feels like it tries too hard on the comedic side. Let me explain this more in a positive and negative light.\\n\\n\r\nFor positives, the mystery drama aspect does excel as we do learn about some of the characters by only by a small margin, even to some characters that doesn\u2019t get showcased as much and the detective arcs are the most intriguing element of the series and they managed to keep it as a reasonable amount of episodes and not overflow it. It shows that the story and characters are more in the grey area.\\n\\n\r\nThe negative is while I do like some of the comedy in the show, however, if not used effectively, it can totally crash and burn and left with a \u201cWTF\u201d look on your face, especially when it involves several of the minor characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, I do find the two leads Sebastian Michaelis and Ciel Phantomhive to be some titillating characters in the show with Sebastian being a suave and cool character and Ciel who you may think might be a spoiled brat but not really; he\u2019s actually likable than what people describe him to me and I really got into most of his storyline. Sadly, as good as those characters are, I can\u2019t say the same to the other supporting characters. Don\u2019t get me wrong, some of them are actually decent characters (like Madam Red, who I actually cared for) but they aren\u2019t that developed all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation\u2026\u2026.hey, A-1 Pictures, you didn\u2019t manage to screw up this time and the art is actually good in here with the Victorian England style to it. Some of the action animation to it is remarkably decent although it does show its budget during the comedic elements of the show and yes, the main leads do look bishonen, something to give the fangirls (and some men, too \u2013 whatever sexual orientation they got) to swoon about. Overall, it is the standard to most anime and it does a good job with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is rather fine\u2026..Taku Iwasaki does a fine job with the score and while he really isn\u2019t someone that capture my attention on scores, except for a few anime (namely The R.O.D series, Gurren Lagann and Soul Eater), he can make the score fit within the tone of the series with any moment delivered. The opening theme is good and find it to be listenable and the 1st ED song was meh, I didn\u2019t really care for it that much but the second ED song\u2026.which was sung by Kalafina w/ Yuki Kaijura on there\u2026..that was a much improvement as they went along with music.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe FUNimation dub is 50/50, as most of the performances were great, even excellent to say the least especially when doing it with British accents but when it\u2019s bad, oh god, it is awful. On the positives, J. Michael Tatum delivers one hell of a performance (see what I did there?) as Sebastian as he does have that smooth gentlemen sound to him and it fits. Another good performance goes to Lydia Mackay for playing Madam Red for a brief and limited time. Brina Palencia as Ciel is rather fine than good, not a performance that I\u2019ve noticed right away but there was that in here but not in a good way and yes, I\u2019m talking about Monica Rial as Mey-Rin. Granted, I like Rial and her voice acting but in here, Mey-Rin sounds grating and annoying. It\u2019s basically somebody trying to imitate a cockney British accent and they tried their best and it backfired. Overall, the dub is alright but nothing I would call remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: Black Butler (Season 1) is a decent show with a tone that can be inconsistent sometimes but doesn\u2019t go into a trainwreck and the comedic tone does actually work with the mysterious and dramatic tone. It\u2019s nothing I would do an impulse buy but it is worth seeing to know what the show is about. I say give this a chance.\\n",

It's dark and mysterious, and the very first episode hooked me because of how, in my opinion, it was comical that a character, not a main one, gets a bit roasted in an oven XD But it's just because I'm a very facetious person that I enjoyed it. You might not be the same. \r\nI give it really high scores because I favored most of the characters. I found them all very important. Well some that aren't really, like Ronald Knox. But all the others were pretty significant to a certain point. \r\nIt has a great soundtrack that fits themood of darkness, vintage/victorian, mystery, etc. and so that deserved a 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation itself, in my opinion was beautiful and had a great quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season was a success in my opinion, but the issues are mostly with Season II. And you'll soon figure out why.\\n\\n\r\nThere are slight hints to a bit of yaoi, not like direct, but that's only because, apparently, the anime was supposed to be a yaoi but the makers decided that it wouldn't be as popular if they did that. I wouldn't recommend this to very religious people for this anime revolves on Angels, Demons, and Hell. I am a Christian and I take my religion seriously, but I knew that the makers weren't trying to make this offensive in anyway and it became one of my favorites. \\n\\n\r\nIt can get a little confusing at certain points, but other than that, overall, it is very entertaining and I recommend that you give it a try ^-^",

The characters are extremely shallow and cliched. It's selling point is the admittedly beautiful artwork but that's just about it.\\n\\n\r\nIf pointless shota-tease and clich\u00e9d spiritualism with gothic atmosphere is your thing, I'm sure you'll give this anime 10/10.

            "content": "I pondered for a long time about just how to approach a review for this show, not because it's bad or anything. I thought it was perfectly fine title, but probably about as bare bones as an anime can get, and that is a bit of a problem for me, since it will sound like I'm being a blowhard whose hating on something a vast majority loves. i'll try my best to explain in a fair manner. Scenes were funny, and I enjoyed the main cast and the macabre setting, but by the time I completed the last episode, nothing about Kuroshitsuji says it willbe an anime title to remember. A fun anime, but hollow.\\n\r\n I'll put on my bifocals, navel-high slacks with suspenders and be the bitter old man talkin about the \"good ol' days of Japanime watchin'\" for a second to explain my position. There's a very good reason why anime like Cowboy Bebop and Fooly Cooly are still being aired on American television; they delivered a dynamic cast of memorable characters, a seducing visual appeal, stellar soundtracks, and were written with heart, subtlty, and patience while showing a respect to it's viewing audience and not treating them like gaggling fanboys and fangirls (my secondary reason is U.S. anime fans failing to give something outside of the norm a chance to breathe some need life into this fledgling industry, but that's a tirade on it's own). I do understand that there is a generational gap between Black Butler and Cowboy Bebop, and I don't wish to try and compare the two. I want to illustrate that there is nothing in Kuroshitsuji that will stick with me. It's entertaining when it has to be, and only seems to drag near the end when it just feels like the show is killing time until that idiotic climax, but it just feels like another hotshot anime title that's keeping the seat warm until the next big anime craze catches everyone's attention. It's seemingly forced sequel is an even stronger indication of a show that desperately wants to be revered ten years from now. That whole vibe I got from this just kind of bugs me about today's anime and it's shallow marketablity that kept Bleach on the air for 14+ seasons.\\n\r\n All of that being aside, it's still a kind of fun endeavor. I thought if every episode played out in a similar fashion of the first episode, I could've given this a strong 9 out of 10. Kind of like Nerima Daikon Brothers, nothing else happens thats even close to it's first episode. Ciel Phantomhive and his charges have an aura that is a bit of a cross between the Addams Family and Tales from the Crypt, and thats what I thought I was getting into. Sebastian himself is pretty enjoyable, but if \"dark\" was the mood Kuroshitsuji was trying to set, then his humor should've been less subtle. You can be twisted and jocular while still being imposing and intimidating if the writing is crisp enough, but Sebby only gets more absurd as the show goes on, which is why it's hard to take the more dramatic moments seriously. and that time should've been used to build Ciel as a character to get behind. instead of learning about his actual plight and the deal he made to get him where he is, his story is just rushed and never seems to develop, so noe I'm stuck with yet another run of the mill revenge-based protagonist. Yay, I haven't seen that done to death or anything. Bardroy, Finnian, and Mey Rin provide most of the comedy and slapstick and are very damn good at it. they are my favorite characters in the whole show, as well as Eliza and her assistant Paula. they were gems.\\n\r\n 16th century Europe is.......well.....about as charming as 16th century Europe would be, given plagues, British Tyranny and all. The setting looks pretty great is what I'm saying. The drab, shadowy visuals and smooth animation make great bedfellows during the marrionette episode, and Grell's life reel animation looks stunning. It really is one of the better looking television shows I've seen since X. \\n\r\n IN CLOSING: It really does sound like I hate Kuroshitsuji more than my score says. While I did enjoy this, it didn't light my world on fire. The main story is easy enough to get into, I felt more could've been done in that regard, and there is plenty of whacky hi-jinks to sink your teeth into if you like a hybrid of light and dark comedy and can make you forget about the weak plot. Kuroshitsuji's weakest aspect is it's inability to try anything we haven't seen already. Amusement parks stay successful by introducing innovative rollercoasters, and anime needs the same kind of boost instead of sitting in place and offering more of the same kind of humor and paint-by-numbers storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 6\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\r\nSOUND: 7\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 5\\n\r\nREWATCH VALUE: 7\\n\r\nOVERALL SCORE: 6 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nPROS: Pretty funny stuff, lovable side characters, art style\\n\r\nCONS: Underdeveloped story, Sebastian wears thin after awhile, nothing really fresh about this title",

            "content": "What do you get when you mix the dark and ominous Death Note and the funny and hysterical Katekyo Hitman Reborn? You get Kuroshitsuji; the odd anime, which gets you hooked right off the bat.\r\nStory: The plot idea was something I have never seen before. It was so unique and thrilling, I had to give it a 9. Why not a 10, you ask? The answer is very simple and probably stupid to many Kuroshitsuji fans... I didn't know what genre Kuroshitsuji was supposed to be. It hinted shouen-ai, bishounen, comedy, something dark and ominous, it was all over the place for me. But thatdoesn't mean I didn't enjoy it; I usually prefer to have a good grip on the genres and such.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Obviously a 10. Need I say more?\\n\\n\r\nSound: An 8, which is much lower than I think it should be, but what the hell. The voices were perfect and everything. I just felt like some of the voice actors were too \"into\" their roles, which somehow set me off. Other then that, it would be perfect all around for sound. Excuse the rhyme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is a score I usually don't give out quite often; a 9. Every character had their own background, which fit in perfectly with the anime. I loved it and was extremely interested in their backgrounds; which is quite unusual for me. Again, not a 10 because their backgrounds seemed a bit far-fetched. But hey, that's Kuroshitsuji for ya'.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: A lower score than all the others, I'm afraid to say. I enjoyed every minute of Kuroshitsuji, don't get me wrong. But unfortunately, I felt bored at some moments, like they were just dragging on a scene. And even sometimes, the scenes went by too quickly for my own likings. And that is what made me score the enjoyment a 7.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: An 8. Brilliant anime. Minor flaws led Kuroshitsuji to get a lower mark from me. But I'm sure a lot of the users of MAL would disagree and rank it a 10 or 9. I recommend Kuroshitsuji for someone who's looking for something different and out of the box. It's perfect for any genre of anime; especially those yaoi lovers, since the mangaka does sort of touch base with shounen-ai. You will not regret watching this anime, I assure you 100%.",

            "content": "I actually really love this show. In order to talk about it in detail, let\u2019s do as Funimation has done and split it into first and second season. The first season starts out rather one a strange note, only giving us a glimpse of Ciel\u2019s life about 2 years after him and Sebastian meeting. We see how the characters interact as well as who is within the household. We don\u2019t get any info into the small 5 minute clip in front of the opening that shows Ciel naked with a red cloth over his body and talking to what looks like a crow. Eventhrew the episodes, they don\u2019t really get on with the story until a few episodes in and we only get more info on how the characters act with one another. I do have to say, the second episode does bring in another fun character that does help later on in the series but he feels a bit out of place for showing him here and then waiting for a long time before you can see him again.\\n\\n\r\nNow some characters feel like they really don\u2019t have a role besides to be comedy relief. Bardroy is terrible as a cook, Finnian is a really bad gardener and Mey-Rin is so clumsy that she breaks everything around her. Even Tanaka is not able to do pretty much anything, looking super deformed. He never really does anything except laughing until way later. I think the only two that mean really anything are Sebastian and Ciel. Luckily, we don\u2019t see much of the blundering characters. \\n\\n\r\nCiel is rather snobby and childish, even though he is placed in a rather high class placing. He acts sometimes without reason and yet tries to play everything off as logic. His fight seems like every other guilt-ed person trying to get revenge. I can understand some of the thought involved as he wants to save his mother and father\u2019s soul, but I could see a lot of different ways they could have done the story line that wasn\u2019t revenge oriented. But it is what it is and they did rather well for it.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, the main attraction is Sebastian. Of all the whining that Ciel does, he puts up with him and the other characters very well. People are going to hate me, but I have to say that Sebastian is pretty much a Mary Sue character. Everything he does is right from the first episode. No matter what, he can get out of any jam as long as it\u2019s in his masters wishes. He looks a lot like Ciel\u2019s father though I believe that he is because of Ciel\u2019s wishes.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole show has almost the same feeling as Spice and Wolf in that a lot of the talks are rather political and somewhat dry because of the Victorian way of talking. Even though it\u2019s like this, it has a lot more action then Spice and Wolf in the beginning which keeps me interested. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty spot on, I don\u2019t normally find any faults in it but in this time period that it came out, it feels more close to the style without going outside the box. To me, it\u2019s a little safe and the only real interesting parts is when they have the little bit of CG in it. It mixes well and gives it something to stand out. The colors are mostly dark but don\u2019t end up turning into rather saturated look. \\n\\n\r\nThe voices are pretty good in the Japanese version, though not really my cup of tea. I fell more for the English dub even with its flaws. I hate May-Rin\u2019s voice. She and Bardroy aren\u2019t really good voices in my mind. They just try to be to much English rather then actually acting. I fell in love with Sebastian\u2019s and Ciel\u2019s voice. The music is beautiful, the opening is rather dark and has a J-pop beat were as the Ending has a more sweet style, taking us out of the dark story line well enough that you don\u2019t really linger to much on the darkness.",

I promised myself that when I watched the show, I'd watch the sub. So when I started watching the sub, I fell in love right away. Daisuke Ono is one of my favorite voice actors and he always does such a good job bringing his characters to life. While I was about eight episodes in the show, I went to stay with my cousins for a week. My older cousin saw me watching the showand asked if she could watch it too. Since she's not a fan of reading subtitles, I started the show over watching the dub. I was ready to die of agony from the obnoxious voice acting, but once we started watching, I fell in LOVE.\u00a0This is one of the few anime where I believed the dub was far better than then sub - with the exception of a few characters. The accents that came along with the dub made the show seem more realistic, given the show takes place in England.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was great. I loved how it unfolded and how everything went into play. Everything was explained clearly and smoothly so there wasn't a single time in the show where I was confused or bored.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe music was beautiful as well and really added to the ominous atmosphere the show created. I enjoyed each opening theme and ending theme so much that I downloaded them onto my phone and listen to them almost daily.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was incredible and I absolutely adored Sebastian's design - so freakin sexy!\u00a0Each character was lovable in their own way, making the show even more exciting to watch. I highly recommend this anime for anyone who loves demons, grim reapers, and HOT butlers!",

Even after the series ended, I was so hooked on this anime that I went and read the manga.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story was quite different from other anime. One of my favorite things to watch about are demons. This anime did have demons. The story is about a young boy who lost everything on his birthday. A demon is summoned and they make a contract. I just loved how Ciel Phantomhive and Sebastian Michaelis's relationship grew.How the two of them trusted each other. Another thing that also made me love this story was the mystery. Throughout the whole anime, I kept asking myself, Who killed Ciel's parents? I just loved the adventure in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art in this was just like any other anime. The animation was good. It not CCG so you dont have to worry about that.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe opening just made me excited to watch this anime. It got me hyped. I loved the opening song so much that I learnt it. However, the second opening was the same song which I was happy and not happy about. I wasn't happy because I wanted another song. Something else as good as the first opening song. I was happy because they didn't change it to a very bad song, like in some anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nI absolutely adored the characters! I thought that Ciel was so set on revenge that it made his character very lovable. How he is so cold and just wants to find his parents killers. That is a change. I loved that Sebastain would twist his way around Ciel's orders. He would make jokes that I would laugh at. I also loved the supporting characters. They made the anime very fun! In my eyes, Ciel and Sebastian's personalities are very good to put together. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime so much! It was very fun and exciting. Adventure and mystery.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nI was so close to giving this anime a 10/10. There were only just a few flaws.  Many other people might give this anime a 7/10 or maybe even a 4/10. That is their opinion and this is mine. This is my favorite anime ever! (Although I have other favorites.)",

            "content": "*NO SPOILERS*\r\nThis may be the most well-written anime series I've seen. Not that it was Oscar-worthy writing, but most of the writing I've seen in anime has always been the thing that prevented me from really loving it. This series doesn't have the lazy, shortcut type of writing that simply fills the plot gaps. It actually builds different stories to support different themes.\r\nAnyways, the series themes of revenge and redemption are woven together well with well-crafted storylines. This isn't an anime with non-stop action, but it does have its share of dark supernatural battle scenes, as well as witty humorous battle scenes. There is quitea bit dark humor in different parts of the series, but it's balanced out by traditional anime slapstick comedy (which I'm actually not a fan of and part of the reason it didn't get 10 stars).\\n\\n\r\nIf you watch the dubbed version, the translation and acting are all excellent. Some hardcore anime fans complain about the fake cockney accents, but they're mostly limited to some supporting characters. The voices for the two main characters (Ciel and Sebastian) are portrayed terrifically and are true in tone to their Japanese voice counterparts (I saw season 2 in the subbed version). Simply put, this may be the best job of versioning I've ever seen in anime. In its early U.S. import days, anime had horrible translations in both subbed and dubbed versions, due to what I expect as literal translations of the script from Japanese to English. Funimation has really done well in this department, as they've taken the meanings of the original Japanese script and rewritten it in English with English idioms and phrases that work perfectly with the characters and themes, rather than just lazily taking the Japanese words and translating them directly into English words, creating phrases that are unusual or that simply don't make any sense.\\n\\n",

Such as the main character's backstory, his past and how he came to sign the contract with the demon butler of his. This particular part is not done very well, as it shows only bits, keeping the rest amystery to be revealed later in another season and covered as a whole new plot-driven scene and episode. \\n\\n\r\nAs the show goes on, we are introduced to many new characters, all of which I think (in my opinion, and I'm sure many others will agree) seem interesting. We are introduced to the cast, which include the servants, such as: the maid, the gardener and the chef, all of which suck at their jobs, but are actual pros at assassinating, killing and have super strength. They have all come from distraught and depressing pasts, those of which include being a guinea pig in a lab to test out different chemicals and odd liquids, being a professional assassin who feels guilt and envious of doing her job, i.e killing innocent families who shared the love she had never experienced, and lastly,  a soldier whose army had been killed in an attack. These don't really play a vital role, but are fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, we have Ciel and Sebastian, more appropriately titled as the master and his butler. The earl i.e Ciel is the 'queen's guard dog', only aged 12, later 13 as the story progresses. In simple terms, this story is based in the 19th century setting, and follows a boy taking revenge on the people who were the cause of the death of his parents, he takes them out one by one while completing the tasks assigned to him by the queen. The series basically follows a sherlock holmes setting, where the mysteries are solved one by one and in the end, the earl, as promised, allows the demon to feast on his soul. \\n\\n\r\nDoes that really happen?\\n\\n\r\nWell, according to manga, not yet. According to the seasons this has been given, it follows a different set of routes. But, none of them end up with the earl dying.\\n\\n\r\nThe only major flaw this anime has, or is lacking in, is character. The characters aren't done very well, for example, you never actually see the growth of any characters or changes in their actions, and no, the problem isn't in Sebastian being over powered from the start, I can work with that factor if it has an entertaining story. the premise is executed well, but a character not well developed dies in the series, which is fine, but if the directors /producers wanted to make us feel sadness or grief, they should've have developed his character more.\\n\\n\r\nBut aside from that,\\n\\n\r\nThis series is mildly entertaining, I just don't want to watch it again.",

            "content": "If you're looking for a rich story line, dark themes, and comedy in between, then Kuroshitsuji is the anime for you! The anime follows young Ciel Phantomhive and his demon butler as he searches for the ones who killed his parents and defiled him. \r\nStory - 10/10\r\nKuroshitsuji's story drags you in the moment you start watching. The plot is suspenseful, with plenty of action to go around. It's a fine mix of supernatural mystery that keeps the watcher interested. The series had a lot of great plot twists in it, and I think the story unfolded very smoothly. The way it is presented gives thewatcher a lot to look forward to, whether you're into the snippets of comedy or the enthralling question as to what's going to happen next.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style doesn't stand out to me as unique, but what it lacks in uniqueness it makes up for with beautiful characters designs, smooth animation, and amazing quality. The details are great, everything from clothing to buildings to the silverware and beyond. It's gives an accurate depiction of the time period as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBoth the Japanese and English voice actors for Kuroshitsuji did a great job matching the characters and their personalities. In fact, most characters in the dub had very similar voices to those of the sub. Another thing I really liked about the sound quality is the OST's. The background music fit very well with the scenes and really pull you in. The opening and end credit songs were also quite fitting. I personally don't mind listening to them by themselves when I'm in the mood for a good instrumental or two.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYou can really fall in love with the characters here; their personalities are enjoyable and the stories they have to tell are emotional. Character development was great as well. I think they did a wonderful job portraying the characters and revealing their stories to the watcher. Character design was also another thing that makes Kuroshitsuji a great anime; the clothing choices are well detailed, accurate, and fit the characters well. I personally enjoyed the designs that were used.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji is definitely one of my go-to animes when I'm in the mood for something dark. I had a great experience watching the series, and have rewatched it twice before. Through the rich emotions and suspenseful plot, I really became connected to the characters. This anime is no doubt a masterpiece all on its own.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was seriously amazing. From the enthralling story line to the well-rounded characters, there's so much to enjoy about this anime series! It earns a 10 out of 10 from me!",

The anime also covers the unsolved mystery of \"jack the ripper\" in an unexpected yet familiar concept & adding both mystery & supernatural..The story is so well written that every episode brings us closer to unraveling the mystries of the past  ..As the story progresses , the bond between ciel & sebastian strengthens ..conquering the obstacles that come ahead ..the charcter development of every character has its own arcs , leading the establishment of the phantomhive household servants who protect the household with their specific set of skills .The star of the show is Sebastian  Michealis , the demon butler capable of doing extraordinary feats with such elegance..  like playing an orchestra with all the tones in perfect harmony , the background music & osts played for his every action is bedazzling indeed . the character design is impressive too ..sebastian is devilishly handsome , intelligent almost a perfect man in ever term(ideal for ladies ) , while ciel (his master) is an arrogant teenager , however his personality does shine in moments ..although ther filler helps keep balance a bit ..overall , kuroshitsuji is no doubt an amazing anime",

            "content": "I\u2019m a big fan of the Victorian age of England. This is not so much because of steampunk (which I am not a fan of for the record) but rather the reality. The clothing, the architecture, the history. It\u2019s a fun era to look into and many people obviously feel the same way. Black Butler takes place in the Victorian era and is a pretty awesome representation of the beauty of this age. From character designs to settings, Black Butler is one of the better looking series I\u2019ve watched. But there are a lot of issues that plague what could have been an otherwise amazinganime. These mostly stem from lackluster characters, as well as a general sense of dullness through the first two-thirds of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCiel Phantomhive is the heir to a toy making throne. His parents wind up dying in a fire and he sells his soul to a demon to get back at those who have wronged him. This demon, Sebastian, brings together a motley crew of strange folk to work at Ciel\u2019s mansion. As his butler, Sebastian is forced to do everything to make Ciel comfortable, but he also helps Ciel in times of dire need. Ciel works for the queen (he is called the queen\u2019s dog) and tends to get into trouble with the London underworld. Thus begins the menial and semi-entertaining adventures of Ciel and Sebastian.\\n\\n\r\nSo, as you can probably tell, I wasn\u2019t impressed with the story at the beginning. There are many story arcs, and none of them are particularly savory. All up to a certain point are flat and uninteresting. The Jack the Ripper thread was okay, the Hound of the Baskervilles-esque adventure was meh, and don\u2019t get me started on the idiotic curry story arc. The first eighteen-ish episodes are very low quality as far as story is concerned.\\n\\n\r\nBut there is a certain amount of fun in them.  This fun mostly stems from a drinking game I created in the process of watching this called \u201cDrink Every Time There is a Gay Overtone\u201d. Needless to say, you can die of alcohol poisoning playing this game. From the start you can see why there is such a huge female fan base. Sure the male characters are handsome fellas, but the closeness of Sebastian and Ciel, the fact that they all wind up in dresses at some point, it\u2019s all very provocative in a way. And while these moments don\u2019t take away from the anime (this is Clamp we\u2019re speaking of, it is supposed to appeal to a female audience), they definitely will have me shying away from typing in Black Butler on DeviantArt.\\n\\n\r\nBut I\u2019ll be the first to admit that Ciel looks good in a dress.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren\u2019t as exciting as I had hoped a demon and a conceited/rather brutal young boy would be. Ciel is a decent character, but he never really grew on me. Sebastian was also decent, he was a badass, but he was stoic and uninteresting half the time. And his catchphrase (\u201cI\u2019m one hell of a butler\u201d) is just dumb. And the bad guys and good guys that are met along the way in the first two thirds of the series are just the same, uninteresting, borderline boring.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I haven\u2019t even gotten deep into the curry arc. This arc was FUCKING STUPID! Horrendous! The prince was a pansy. The bodyguard guy was lame. The Iron Chef reference was stupid! It didn\u2019t fit in! It was just plain dumb! The only good part of this arc was seeing the Crystal Palace. That was awesome. Otherwise, this arc is pointless!\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, the series gets good! Starting with the infiltration of the religious cult, the series went from being merely average to pretty damn good. The angel was cool, the fights were interesting, the plot started to get really intense and fun to watch develop. The plot becomes this kind of conspiracy with Queen Victoria trying to bring Britain and France to war so that England can take over Europe. It\u2019s a cool idea that is played out real well. The angel\u2019s inclusion is a good touch.\\n\\n\r\nBut the last episode is a total let down. When you set up an epic battle between a fallen angel and a demon, you expect great things. Instead, we are forced to basically watch ten seconds of Sebastian tearing the angel to pieces. And that\u2019s that. Black Butler has some good action scenes, look at episode two and the fight against the Italian mob. But this was a total letdown. And I couldn\u2019t help but think of the new Sherlock Holmes film when watching the fight. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the writer of that film got some inspiration for the movie from Black Butler\u2019s ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe end third is where some cool characters show up. As I said, the angel was kind of cool. But I liked seeing who the Phantomhive household workers really were. Meirin was a total dweeb, I thought she was cute and clumsy through the first two thirds, but the last third made me think of her more so as a total hardass. It was the same with many characters. Except Sebastian. When I saw him in heels, I was scared.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all complaints, I enjoyed Black Butler overall. It had a lot of good ideas but didn\u2019t execute them as well as it could have. It\u2019s the perfect example of a merely \u201cgood\u201d anime.  And it is also a perfect example of a comeback anime. Starts okay, but does become pretty cool toward the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you like Victorian England, you will surely like this anime. Its attention to detail is immaculate and the world displayed is beautiful. But with a lot of rockiness concerning plot and characters, it is not the amazing anime I was hoping for.",

            "content": "In this period piece, an angry teenager brutally avenges himself against a conspiracy through the power of his Bishounen employee.\r\nIn 'Black Butler' a bitter and furious 12-year old member of the Landed Gentry plots his revenge, Kira-style, on a deranged cult secretly infecting the British Empire.\r\nHe does this by siccing his hyper-competent butler on them. \r\nNo, really. It may sound silly, but it's actually awe-inspiring.\r\nIt works because the two main characters are so well realized. They are both fascinating to watch. One doomed and tragic; the other a razor-sharp cipher. Their relationship, a mutually predatory one, where they tear the flesh off their enemies beforefinally turning on one another.\\n\\n\r\nCiel Phantomhive, the last surviving member of an Aristocratic Family, serves the Crown as  \"The Queen's Guard Dog\"; a shady troubleshooter, who solves supernatural mysteries in her majesties Realm, by any means necessary. He does this through guile and brute force, without the slightest hint of fear, because he is fueled by an bottomless pool of rage, and a fatalistic acceptance of his fate.\\n\\n\r\nHe is \"assisted\" in this role by the titular Black Butler, Sebastian. \\n\r\nOn the surface, Sebastian appears to merely be an extremely competent servant -- a pillar of Victorian decorum and dignity, always dapper and clean -- but can, at a single command from his pint-sized superior, he becomes a whirling engine of terror and destruction.\\n\r\nIn this mode, Sebastian isn't so much a weapon, but more like a relentless force of nature. Not so much deployed, rather just pointed in a direction and ordered to demolish everything in front of him.\\n\r\nAll the while, he wears a faint smile, as if he is the only one who is in on the joke.\\n\r\nI'd say Sebastian is perfect, with not a hair out of place, but his hair IS perpetually out of place. His character model has a deeply anachronistic hairstyle that is not only out of place for the time period, it is out of place for a butler.\\n\r\nI do understand that his hairstyle is there for the fangirls to go squee over, but occasionally it takes one out of the moment to see a Victorian-era British Butler with a Visual-Kei coiffure.\\n\\n\r\nI think the only real glaring problem with Kuroshitsuji is the comedic elements. There are, especially in the beginning of series, heaping piles of stupid super-deformed slapstick, especially dealing with the other four servants of the Phantomhive household. The cook, groundskeeper, maid and sub-Butler are all varying degrees of loudly incompetent. Most insufferable is Mey-Rin (who is voiced by the usually much better Monica Rial), whose shrill caterwauling will make you scrambling to switch to the Japanese Dubtrack just to escape her shrieky babbling.\\n\r\nAlso, their British accents are the most glaringly fake in the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nSo, there you have it.\\n\r\n'Black Butler' is what you get when you mix 'Jeeves and Wooster' with a Gothed-out Late 1800's-era 'X-Files'; well, that is if Wooster was a pint-sized Bruce Wayne instead of a buffoon and Jeeves was...well, Satan.\\n\\n\r\nNo, that is not a spoiler.\\n\r\nIt becomes unambiguously apparent from the frist few minutes of the first episode what kind of Faustian relationship exists between the two main protagonists.\\n\r\nKnowing this makes Ciel's angst (at how far he had to sink in order to avenge himself) more understandable; and why Sebastian's calm, patient demeanor contains a faint whiff of contempt in it. It's not because he's snooty and thinks he's superior to the mere rabble. It is because He IS superior to the mere rabble.\\n\r\nThis makes his rogueish charm all the more disturbing.",

This guy only watched 15 of the 24 episodes and he thinks he can write a review!?\" and I'd say back, \"Normally not,\" but this is an exception because I find that in any story the first few episodes are absolutely crucial. If anyone tells me a show is good but you have to bear through the first few episodes to get to the good stuff then I'd tell them that they lied because that is not a good show. A good show, in my opinion, is a show that willkeep me from the hook to the end. Therefore, if the beginning is unbearable, or the story loses me part way through (and I'm not talking about a story having a slump because that is natural for most long series, but rather make me completely lose interest and take me way outside of the experience) the show has failed regardless of what comes after (again in my opinion). So I'm writing this review of my experience of the first 15 episodes of Black Butler (\u9ed2\u57f7\u4e8b) and why I dropped it. I'm not going to go through all the rating categories (story, art, sound, etc.) so I'll just get to the heart of the matter. \\n\\n\r\n***We might be getting into some SPOILER GREY AREA pretty soon so read at your own risk***\\n\\n\r\nSo this show actually got a good start (which is why I've managed to shove 15 episodes down my throat) and held together an interesting plot, interesting characters, it understood when to reveal information and when not to (going back on the 'show, don't tell' principle), it got right to the chase with the plot and interesting developments started almost immediately, and most importantly a scene would set a distinguishable tone and stick to it. Now one of my favorite video games of the past few years is called Bloodborne and because of it I took a new found liking to a Victorian style setting and tone, so Black Butler has everything going for it right now (except maybe the Shoujo fantasy but I've learned to put up with that stuff). My only qualm with this so far is the Black Butler, Sebastian, is such an extremely useful butler and almost no flaws which becomes a very convenient plot devise to make things far too easy for the main character. Again, another thing that is very common in anime, so I learned to put up with it and focused my attention on the more interesting and conflicted characters.  \\n\\n\r\nBut around the 7th episode, when the demon hound story begins, Black Butler practically committed seppuku here. So the main characters showed up in a small England village that is run by a rich man. This village is haunted by an elusive demon hound that kills all those that disobey the rules of the rich man. The village lore declares the hound a long-time protector of the rich man's family and the main characters take it upon themselves to solve this mystery. This story kind of reminded me of the Wolfman (which I really liked) and everything was going great: good tension was building up, there was a tone being set, and I was truly intrigued to see how it ended. Since it is about a demon hound and since people were found horrendously torn to pieces by this hound, I was really looking forward to a somewhat scary/thrilling conclusion to this story. \\n\\n\r\n***Now this is some SPOILER territory so be warned***. \\n\\n\r\nSo the demon hound has finally been found and it turns out it is actually a demon hound. So here comes the thrilling conclusion to all this building up tension. Except thrilling would be the last thing I'd call it. Sebastian (the Black Butler) showed up immediately after finding the demon hound and he ends up kicking the thing so hard into the ground that they discover a new hot spring. After the fight, Sebastian beat the demon hound into submission and ended up taming him. Thus they brought the demon hound back with them to be their new friend. And it turns out that this demon hound was just confused and didn't know what he was doing when he killed those people. \\n\\n\r\nI felt absolutely betrayed. That was like blowing up a balloon but before it pops somebody just poked a hole in it and let all the air just pathetically deflate. What happened to all that tension? What happened to the tone? All my emotions up until then were just thrown back into my face like they were saying, \"Oh! Were you hoping for an actually good story with an exciting end? NO! You get a happy-go-friendly ending that the characters did nothing to earned!\" I hate happy endings. Ok, that's kind of not true so I'll reword it; I hate happy endings that weren't earned. What I mean by that is a happy ending doesn't happen so easily in the real world so I despise when these characters get a happy ending without hardly doing anything. If you've seen the Naruto ending, I liked that happy ending because that was hard earned that could've turned south real easily. However, this was pathetic and anti-climatic. Sebastian is such a plot devise for simply solving problems to keeping the other characters from actually having to do anything except make jokes. \\n\\n\r\nSo I almost stopped there, but they started foreshadowing that all those events had an underlying purpose to the main story that looked a little interesting and more promising. So I kept watching until episode 15 rolled around and they ended up having a curry making contest before the Queen. Doesn't sound that bad, does it? Well, it was. From the beginning of this story arc, it was established that this was a serious advancement of the story and not just an extra comedic episode. Well at first it was, but it quickly turned into the most goofy, absurd, and unbelievable series of events I could imagine. Now this wouldn't be bad if I wasn't meant to take this seriously just like Gintama. However, the climatic scene ended up being jumbled up foreshadowing and comedy which did not work together at all creating such an awkward experience. You see, the problem with this is TONE. I have no idea what I'm suppose to be feeling about this because it pulls me straight out of the story. Is this suppose to be serious? Is this suppose to be funny? Is this actually plot development? Is this filler? Is what is happening important or even make sense? \\n\\n\r\nThis episode also used way too much symbolism that was thrown crudely in your face and they constantly reminded you, \"THIS IS SYMBOLISM!\" just like that which I hate. Also, three characters were introduced in this story arc and they were far too emotional for me to care about them. Any character that is emotional and sad when you first meet them isn't going to make me care about them or the story; it makes them look like pathetic wimps. And after the whole climatic scene, they explained that all the stuff that went down was because of some 'evil spice' that brings out the bad stuff in people's hearts, and the police heard that and just accepted it like that was normal not even questioning it. This is a world where they have to hide the fact that Sebastian is a demon because that would cause people to panic, AND when a 'demon hound' showed up in a small village the residents went absolutely superstitious and freaked out. So 'evil spice' is just the norm is this society I guess. And annoyingly, Sebastian and the main character ended up talking down to the new characters like they knew what was up. Well do they? I hate it when characters talk like they are coming from experience and authority when they really didn't learn anything themselves up until then. \\n\\n\r\nWell that's two strikes and I didn't feel like giving it a chance for a third because I already despise these characters and the story. No matter what comes after this, nothing is worth pushing through something this miserable. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not sure how other people would think about this but I found myself being extremely disappointed with this story. So, if what I explained to you is something you think you would like I won't dissuade you from it. I'm not going to give it a rating because again I haven't seen the full show, I'm just saying don't expect a good story-telling experience with Black Butler.",

            "content": "From my past experiences with anime, I got to say that this anime is truly amazing in it's own way. This anime grabbed my attention because of it's style. But even I got to say, I was debating on wether to watch it or not. Everyone knows that you should never judge a book by it's cover. Or in this case, you should never judge an anime by it's art. But in the end I watched it.\r\n As i watched the whole anime, I noticed that it didn't really have a good character development, so I was confuse for some of the time. Ialso noticed that the story didn't really have an exact plot. It really was just about an adventure with a 12 year old boy who had a contract with a demon.\\n\\n\r\nBut don't mind the factor above. This anime is excellent and I recommend it to those who like dark humor and twisted fate. But it's also have a sadistic flavor to it. In other word, this is a dark anime. And just the way I like it, it doesn't have meaningless bloody scene that tries to be a wannabe horror movie like many anime out there. This anime is creative yet cute at the same time. \\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoy the anime if you watch it.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Serey",

            "content": "Black Butler was an anime that effective mixed elements of black comedy, mystery and the supernatural exploring Ciel's involvement with various paranormal mysteries while seeking revenge with the help of his butler, Sebastian. The major bone of the series is focused around the bond between Sebastian and Ciel. The chemistry between the two is an interesting one considering their deal and Sebastian's not-so-normal origins. Both tend to snark on one another frequently in regards to their actions and thoughts with Ciel reprimanding Sebastian for some of his thoughtless actions and Sebastian going after Ciel for showing signs of remorse towards any victim caught in theway of his plans of revenge. Both however do show concern of one another thanks to the conditions of their deal.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the show's comedy, Black Butler gets its kicks off poking fun of the surprisingly funny moments coming from the show's various dark figures. From seeing an undertaker want jokes as payment for information related to a murder to an anachronism related to a Grim Reaper's weapon to some shocking information regarding the bungling servants of the Phantomhive manor, the show does well for the most part at delivering its laughs when you would least expect it.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is mostly spread out into a number of arcs where Ciel is sent to investigate random mysteries with aid from Sebastian where the circumstances to each case are not as they seem on the surface. The mysteries mix around both their serious and funny moments in regards to the supernatural origins regarding a perpetrator or are connected to Ciel's tragic past as he seeks his revenge. The show dabbles into quite a bit of dark territory with its mysteries showing the most corrupt sides of the human psyche with a number of characters who are aware or unaware of how flawed they truly are. This also rings true with Ciel's character as despite how corrupt he believes himself to have become because of his deal with Sebastian that he still retains some signs of morality, even while in denial of it.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of visuals, Black Butler sports scenery which is vast and sporting a great amount of detail as there are a variety of settings to take in from city landscapes to countrysides to being on ships. The subdued color tones used with the settings and character designs do well at complementing the dark and gritty mood that the series gives off. However for a series that puts focus on its action, Black Butler's animation is noticeably subpar at points with shortcuts being apparent in action scenes with the only moments of highlight with animation coming from the movement coming from ships and horse carriages rendered in CG animation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I got enough enjoyment out of seeing Black Butler thanks to its surprisingly funny black comedy, chemistry between Ciel and Sebastian and the developments surrounding Ciel's search for those responsible for his family's murder. If you are looking to get your laughs off of more macabre moments with solid plot development tossed into the mix, then Black Butler offers up a worthwhile choice for you to look into.\\n",

            "content": "Holy chiz.\r\nWhat.... What is this madness?\r\nWhere do I begin?\r\nNot much catches my interest. I'm pretty picky when it comes to shows and manga. I like things that are dark and funny, philosophical and tragic, deep and moving, unique and quirky. I hadn't believed I'd really like this. \r\nI was wrong.\r\nBlack Butler is complex as hell. It's like, you start out with this simple anime, this show made purely for entertainment, and as you go on, without even realizing it, it becomes darker and more complicated. You see into the tragic pasts, the characters' emotional pains, the inevitable future, and your left going, \"HOLY SHIT, WHATJUST HAPPENED!\" It takes a hold of you and opens your eyes. You feel Ciel's pain and his lust for revenge and you want to skin his enemies alive because you begin to hate them with the same fury that he does.You pick up little things, like how Sebastian seems to really care for Ciel though he would never admit it, or how Elizabeth uses her perkiness to hide her real despair. You're entranced and want to know what happens next, you squeak and squeal when ever anything DOES happen, you fall in love with the characters, you scream when it hits you that you finished watching the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just like... there's not even a word for it. This show that was meant for entertainment suddenly becomes a psychological wonderland that gets you thinking and question your very existence.The philosophy in it makes you wonder and ponder, it grabs your attention and makes you think hard about what religion and justice and death really are.\\n\\n\r\nBefore you know it, you are watching what has to be the most complex, complicated, unique masterpiece on earth.\\n\\n\r\nCiel Phantomhive. He makes my heart ache. With his brutal past, I can totally understand why he's such a killjoy. You know what? He has every right to be a killjoy. No one can go through what he has and not have that right. He's devoted his life to finding the sadistic murderer of his parents, even making a deal with a demon to sell his soul. He's also the emotionally strongest character I have ever come across, in books, movies, animes, mangas, and everything else you can think of. Instead of moping and being depressed, he uses his loathing as armor, to totally shield him from things that would make normal people cry. My absolute favorite quote of his is, \"No. I won\u2019t abandon my hatred. If I do, nothing would be left of me.\" Which is absolutely true.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters all have their own personalities as well. Not a single one of them was boring, dull, a piece of cardboard. Even the enemies (Drocell, for example) are alive with feeling and emotion. None of them are alike. They're all different and various, but magnificent all the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe enemies were simply chilling. The doll house especially. None of them are cheesy and fake and laughable. In fact, a few of them seriously freak me out. Not in a disgusting gory way, but in an intimidating creepy way.\\n\\n\r\nEven though this anime is 95% dark, there is humor in it. Most of this is from Grell, the main comedic relief, but there's also Sebastian and the servants who are funny. I grinned like a moron through most their scenes, catching all of the subtle jokes and sarcasm throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nTo this day, I'm still not sure if Grell is a boy or a girl.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing to gush about while I'm at it: The muuuuuusic! Kuroshitsuji 1 and 2 have the most beautiful soundtrack I've heard since Vampire Knight. There are amazing creepy songs like \"The Doll House,\" hilariously quirky ones like \"Die Hasen!\"(\"The Rabbit\"), and depressing ones that make you want to bawl your eyes out like \"Si deus me Relinquit\" (\"If God leaves me\"). In fact, I'm listening to these songs on Youtube as I write this. They're diverse and vary in styles, genres, and even languages: German, Latin, English, Indian, etc. Though I don't think there are any Japanese lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I am so freaking in love with this anime that this long explanatory review doesn't even begin to cover it. You will be impressed. You just have to give it time to morph into this mysterious philosophical being that it is. You will be left slack-jawwed and begging for more. You'll join all of those lame petitions for a season 3. You'll wish you'd watched it sooner.\\n\\n\r\nI promise you won't regret it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n(BTW, I prefer the English dub. Just a recommendation)",

Hearing the story synopsis be - demon butler and an heir to a major company make the dynamic duo in England - it didn't appeal to me, but when my friend pressed me to watch it, my views had changed.  \r\nSolving mysteries with a badass demon butler mixed with some comedy, drama and unpredictable plot twists. This is Kuroshitsuji. Ciel and Sebastian are like two sides that make a coin. Ciel has the authoritive yet passive demeanor and Sebastian has the cool, badass style which balances this character development out. \r\nAs for storyline - it is yourgeneral \"Same thing different people, different day\" In the fact that they solve mysteries episode to episode BUT .. BUT BUT BUT! They all have significance, and not at all do they feel like fillers. In one way or another  they develop on the story or characters in each episode and in solving these mysteries they become one step closer to solving the overall mystery that we are in for. All season I was wishing for that little tug on Ciel's part that shows he really did care for Sebastian more than just a butler. Did I get that satisfaction.. well you can find out for yourself xD If there is anything thaty dissapointed me in this show, it would be the lack of screen time (action wise) for Chef and the other two musketeers.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely find the time for Black Butler,  it's an anime that every anime watcher must see!",

Let's start then ... \r\n  Firstly, I gave a 10 to the story. I know that there are many complaints about the fillers but even that episodes are funny. Also, I'm kinda disappointed that they part ways with the manga and choose a different path but I'm glad that they adapt their story well and they gave a proper conclusion to Ciel's story. Honestly, my favourite parts were the Jack the Ripper arc andthe finale !\\n\r\n  The soundtrack is also perfect and so much fitting to the anime , but the real masterpiece is the opening ! Monochrome no kiss is one of the best anime openings I have ever heard and I love how they used the second part of the song for the last part of the season.  The visual part of the openings were also perfect and teasing for the next part of the anime. The endings were very good but I prefered Lacrimosa , since it fits so much with the tone of that episodes. As for the voice actors they have done marvelous job especially Daisuke Ono, Maaya Sakamoto and Jun Fukuyama !\\n\r\n  Furthermore, the characters were so much well written that you could easily relate to them. That applies mostly in Ciel's case, where we had seen him grow so much as a character. About the secondary characters, maybe they didn't have so much screen-time to evolve, but there are many all time classics like Grell , Undertaker and even Lau ! \\n\r\n  Lastly, for the enjoyment, I had a great time watching this anime. Many fans may prefer the manga [and I will certainly check it] but I believe that they should also give a chance to the anime !",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji - or Black Butler as it's called in English speaking countires - is a pretty okay anime adaptation of Yana Toboso's incredible work. Since the manga is not finished, it does try to make up it's own conclusion to the series. \r\nSTORY (spoilers ahead, skip if you wish)- Everything follows a similar path to Yana's original work for a large majority aside from certain episodes (and arc endings) that are changed to fit the anime only finale. My only big problem that makes me go \"it's okay\" is that the queen of England is behind Ciel's parents murders. Sure ya know it's a incrediblyinteresting idea to have the woman Ciel had worked for be the one to kill his parents but the reasoning behind everything she did feels lazily written. Yes, the stuff with her husband is sad (and what she does is disgusting) but i don't understand that status quo ending where she becomes a normal elderly woman again. Why make her look like a child as well? I doubt she wanted to look young, she just wanted her husband back. I suppose they did that so people would be like \"prettyyyyy~\" and wouldn't think she did anything wrong when i think it's less suspicious if she was still a elderly woman. Angela/Ash made no sense to me either. Their motivations feel incredibly murky. Were they kicked out of Heaven? Why can they change genders? Why did they want to make a pact with a demon when they clearly despise? Sebastian leaving Ciel felt.....just really desperate to get Ciel his motivation back too. \\n\\n\r\nART- Unlike it's second season, the art quality is very high for this. They did a fantastic job recreating Yana's art style and the coloring is both dark yet beautiful choices in palette. The backdrops are stunning at how detailed they are. Even different times of days have incredible colors. My only complaint is i noticed some character's colors were changed from the manga (Mei-Rin's dress being dark blue instead of black). I'll explain my thoughts on the characters later but i do enjoy the designs of everyone. My favorite is Drocell's design (even if he does look like Joker suspicious, funny as the circus arc did start around the time of the first anime's production right?) \\n\\n\r\nSOUND - Both the English dub and Japanese versions acting is pretty good! With the English dub I would say some actors didn't try hard with their accents (Bardroy and Drocell didn't do well to me). I do prefer the English dub over the Japanese for this series so i don't have many comments to make about the original version. The music is good as well, incredible orchestral sounds! I would say that sometimes i heard rock music or something like that in the show and i don't think that fits the tone of Black Butler. The other music matches Black Butler's refined yet exciting aesthetic while the rock feels honestly pretty over done in comparison. The intro is pretty good, a classic opening song. The ending ones are good too, though i find I'M ALIVE is maybe a little unfitting for Black Butler mostly due to it's beat? That's just me, of course i absolutely adore the song. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - As i say in story, i feel like The Queen, Angela and Ash are lacking here. Pluto felt like a BIG out of character moment for everyone involved in Black Butler. I get they wanted a character who was cool and funny but a demon wolf that turns into a man? That doesn't work out for me. It doesn't help that no one questions it too much, not even guests seem to question a giant wolf in their garden! I'd have explain this in story but this mostly feels fitting for character. Of course the original characters of Yana like Sebastian, Ciel, Finnian, Grell, Madam Red, etc are fantastically written. Though, i do feel like Grell was unnecessary in a lot of arcs. She feels like she was kinda put in lazily like a fan fiction for Black Butler, maybe less Grell would have been for the best. I also feel like Lau was incredibly OOC in this one as well. He is a snake and has a opium den, but i doubt he'd try to start another war especially after having seen the horrors of it first hand judging by the backstory he had. Now, the Queen feels really strange for me. Yes, it is natural for her to feel misery after her husband died but how broken did she have to be to let a angel sew her husband's corpse onto her and make her look like she's Ciel's age? None of that makes any sense and feels like they had a lot of trouble. Angela/Ash is also one that feels lazily written and could've used a better explanation. Why couldn't they have made them angel TWINS? I imagine the battle would've been even crazier if we watched Sebastian battle twin angels and take them down without breaking a sweat. It also makes it confusing as to which one is the real gender, is Angela or Ash the real one? Drocell, who appeared in that strange ring arc, was okay. He felt much like if you sucked the life out of Joker from the manga/2nd anime's second arc. Aberline was so far from his manga counterpart though, it's ridiculous and interesting at the same time.  It was nice to have him act as a sort of father figure to Ciel as not even in the manga do we see that, but i don't appreciate what they did with him as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Black Butler is a really enjoyable anime. This was the first anime i watched that wasn't considered for children in America (as before this the only anime I had seen was Yu Gi Oh, Digimon and Pokemon) so there is a lot of childhood nostalgia for it as well. However, looking back many plot elements didn't age well for me.",

            "content": "Before taking an anime hiatus, the name \"Black Butler\" seemed to keep popping up everywhere I went. From fan art to posters and symbols, the name had been etched into my mind before I even got anywhere close to watching this show.   \r\nSeeing how boring my summer actually was, I decided to go back to watching anime and the name Black Butler was the first thing that came to my mind. After doing a quick Google search, I saw a bored kid with a weird eyepatch (was this show about classy sassy pirates?), and also skimmed through the description of the first episode(which involved a servant trying to cook a guest he had just put in the oven). Already, this show was starting to look not only pretty wacky, but also strangely morbid and disturbing , so I almost didn't go through with watching it, but hey, anything's better than going out and melting under the scorching summer sun.\\n\\n\r\nHaving already developed a bit of a negative bias towards this anime, I wasn't really  expecting to enjoy it, let alone fall in love with it, but then again, falling in love is always something unexpected. After overcoming my initial surprise about how funny and pleasant this show actually was, I noticed some other positive aspects such as the art, the music, the voice acting, and, of course - the interesting characters and the intricate story. \\n\\n\r\nSince I was already attracted by the compelling premise involving the whole deal-with-the-devil theme, I was pretty much ecstatic when I found out that the show was set in Victorian England. Having already fallen in love with Ashita no Nadja many years ago precisely because of its European setting and enchanting depictions of period costumes and architecture, I knew that Kuroshitsuji would not disappoint in this aspect. \\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the art not only met my expectations, but also exceeded them by far. Besides the lavish architecture and costumes, the colors used were also very aesthetically pleasing and sophisticated. Furthermore, the use of so much color was in itself unexpected for an anime constantly dealing with death, demons, and general creepiness. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing which I didn't expect for such a PG-13 show was the amount of blood involved. Although it was nowhere near the pointless and ridiculous gore of Elfen Lied, it did \"come out\" quite often and there were even some random flying limbs involved every now and then, but hey, I guess it was all for the sake of art. \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, the attention to details like the intricate patterns on the tea sets and cutlery as well as the wrinkles on shoe laces and bows made every moment of this show gorgeous and memorable.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what would a pretty setting and detailed backgrounds be without dynamic characters and an interesting story? (Well, probably Sword Art Online, but that's not the topic right now).\\n\\n\r\nBesides being beautifully designed and animated, almost all the characters also happen to have interesting backstories, odd quirks, and very unique personalities . Although the protagonist could easily be summarized as a bit of an immature brat who only wants revenge (and doesn't even know how to tie his own shoelaces), the reality is that Ciel is far more complex than that. From a traumatic past to a depressing near future featuring his imminent death as well as a chaotic present, you can definitely see why he behaves the way he does and why he would make a deal with a demon. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough even less is known about this demon than his current master,  he still manages to convey a strong and cunning personality which not only seduces and charms everyone around him within the anime, but also many of those who watch it from \"the outside\" (after all, he was named the top male anime character and best \"husbando\" at least two years in a row. Or something like that).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it's not just the individual personalities and backstories (or lack thereof) of the two main characters which make this show so appealing, but also their relationship. Although it is meant to be that of a master and butler (or servant, if one were to simplify), having the latter be after the former's soul makes it difficult to decide who controls and overpowers who. Additionally, this dark butler also acts as a chef, teacher, companion, and anything else his master might require, which sometimes makes him look more like a caretaker or parent figure rather than a purely evil demon. (This is further reinforced by the fact that the MC is an orphan who has been living without much love and affection for quite some time).\\n\\n\r\nWhile this relationship is both very difficult to define and extremely entertaining to observe, there are of course other characters, relationships, and interactions which also come into play and make the story all the more interesting. From cross-dressing shinigami (or Death Gods) to the Queen of England, this anime has everything to take you on a wild ride while making you laugh and cry along the way. \\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the characters are not only brought to life through the power of beautiful art and animation, but also through that of amazing voice acting. Although Daisuke Ono is in a class of his own and uses one of the sultriest and most beautiful voices I have ever heard in anime for his role as Sebastian, other seiyuu like Fukuyama Jun and Hiroki Yasumoto also never fail to surprise and delight with their equally impressive vocal ranges and amazing performances. The success of the Kuroshitsuji seiyuu events as well as the awards won by Ono-D for his work in this show should therefore come as no surprise. (What does come as a surprise, however, is the fact that a vacuuming robot featuring phrases by Sebastian Michaelis was actually being sold in Japan. Guess there are people who are even more obsessed with Ono-D's voice than I am, huh). \\n\\n\r\nFor the record, I also tried to check out the English dub but this was very brief since I simply couldn't stand Ciel sounding like a whiny, constipated little girl. Although he is voiced by a girl in Japanese too, he doesn't sound as one as much as he does in English. Sebastian, on the other hand, sounds pretty great with an (unfortunately fake) English accent as do the other characters. Having a special (though also fake) accent for the Indian characters was also appreciated since they didn't get one in Japanese. \\n\\n\r\nBesides the fabulous voice acting of the main and supporting cast, another great aspect of this anime (which also happens to be really underrated) is definitely the music. Although Yuki Kajiura didn't compose the soundtrack for this show, her band Kalafina is featured  repeatedly and makes a beautiful addition to all the other music used in Kuroshitsuji. Besides Kalafina's Lacrimosa and Becca's \"I'm alive\" as the ending songs, the opening theme called \"Monochrome no Kiss\" is also pretty awesome and fits with the overall mood of the show really well. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it is not just these songs which deserve praise and admiration, but also those original ones used as background music throughout the series, such as \"La gardenia\" and \"Die Hasen\". Although I personally think it would have made more sense to use more songs in English since this anime is actually, well, set in England, I think that the music director did a wonderful job in incorporating not only different European languages into the soundtrack but also some more classical and darker vibes. Besides German, English, and Italian, the show also features songs in Latin and Hindi as well as themes reminiscent of Gregorian chants. Consequently, this makes the anime feel, if not entirely English, then at least very sombre, European and Victorian. Despite the bad pronunciation by some of the artists who sung the songs in German and Latin, the Japanese tenor who was hired to sing the songs in Italian has an impeccable accent and makes them sound, if not entirely like opera, then at least like classical crossover or operatic pop. This makes Black Butler the perfect combination of modern and Victorian, hence overall timeless and cosmopolitan.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it may not be everyone's cup of tea, Black Butler is a beautiful and unique anime that is definitely worth watching. Whether it be for the original story and wonderful characters, the gorgeous art, animation, and music, or the random quirky humor, it has something for everyone and is therefore difficult to define or categorize simply as \"another shounen show\". For me, the only problem was how creepy and disturbing the anime got towards the end, but since it is likely that this was what the creators had originally intended, then this should probably count as a strength rather than a weakness. \\n\r\nConsequently, while Kuroshitsuji may not be THE best show I have ever seen in my life, it is certainly ONE of them and therefore holds a very special place in my heart and soul  (as well as my MAL favorites, of course). If you're asking yourself whether you should watch Black Butler, then, in the words of Sebastian Michaelis, all I can say is \"Yes, My Lord.\"",

            "content": "Although the first season of Black Butler (Kuroshitsuji) sort of serves as an icebreaker for the seasons after, it still counts, as it isn't simply a pilot but an entire season. Therefore, I must acknowledge it.\r\nIt's difficult to explain how I feel about the first season of Black Butler. I was very entertained by it, but it was almost as if there was more comic relief than any actual story. During the first season almost everything was done to try and make the viewer laugh, which was nice but not nice enough to save the season. \r\nThe story isn't bad, but the problem is thatthere isn't really a story in the first place. Black Butler stars a young boy named Ciel Phantomhive who is the earl of the Phantomhive family and his butler, who is a demon named Sebastian Michaelis. (In case you didn't know, Black Butler is set in the time of the Victorian Era.) Ciel forms a contract with Sebastian in order to get revenge on the people who have soiled the Phantomhive name, and to get revenge on the person who burned down his mansion and caused the death of his parents--although he doesn't know who this person is yet. \\n\\n\r\nBut the story, for some odd reason, doesn't seem to be centered on that, at least not during the first season. Sure, Ciel brings it up all the time, but the situations he gets involved in don't usually have to do with exacting his revenge, which is strange. Also, remember how I earlier said that this season doesn't really have a story? I'm going to bring that up again. Every episode of this season there's a different problem. Each problem is resolved at the end of its episode. However, these problems would definitely not realistically be resolved in such a short amount of time. Additionally, most of these problems appear to be either randomized or extremely unlikely. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I'd like to acknowledge is that the characters are pretty much two-dimensional. And to be fair, that's usually what characters are until the second season or, in some cases, even later. But besides Sebastian being a badass and Ciel having the personality of a bratty (yet badass) rebel and the capability of a nine-year-old, the characters don't really have anything else about them. The rest of the characters are so toned down that I can't really say much about them besides \"comic relief.\" \\n\\n\r\nI would just like to let anyone who is reading this and is agitated know that I actually do like Black Butler, very much. Although I've been mostly bringing up this season's issues (and indeed I believe this season was definitely not the best season Black Butler had), I don't dislike Black Butler at all. It just doesn't seem overly special, at least not by this point, and I will post a review for the second season, since I've also watched that. The story isn't overly unique (if there's a story at all). \\n\\n\r\nBut here are some good points about this season of Black Butler. The art and animation is very good. There's nothing to complain about there. The quality of the anime itself (rather than the story, characters, etc.) is incredibly satisfactory. Don't let this review turn you off from starting Black Butler; there are many people who like it more than I do, and I'm just one opinion. I hope this helped!",

Later Ciel summons the demon Sebastian Michaelis to be his butler, help him with his missions, and protect him. This gripping anime is about Ciel and Sebastian solving mysteries and going through the life of a young English aristocrat.\r\nPros:\r\n* first of all, the artwork is amazing and sort of reminiscent of Tim Burton's creepy drawing style. It's dark and beautiful all at once.\r\n* Well Developed characters. you quickly fall in love with and care foreach character very quickly.\\n\\n\r\n* the action scenes are entertaining and not too much to watch.\\n\\n\r\n*The mysteries are compelling and leaves you needing to know what happens next. \\n\\n\r\n*The world is well-developed,  beautifully drawn, and easy to understand how this world works. \\n\\n\r\n*the Japanese dub is beautiful. (Sebastian's voice tho) the English dub isn't too bad. however, the acting isn't as good with English. but both voices were equally pretty similar to each other.\\n\\n\r\n* The accuracy to the way Englishmen dress and act are pretty well executed in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n*Love the theme song for both series'\\n\\n\r\n* I love the dark humor in this show. I laughed way too hard with some of the jokes.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n*  Violence and gore are everywhere in this anime. So, if you can't handle blood, guts, or implied rape. This anime wouldn't be for you. The blood is more prevalent than the sexual violence.\\n\\n\r\n* if you are religious, you may feel uncomfortable with things Sebastian does. I'm religious and the things that happen somethings were very uncomfortable to watch. there are angels and demons in this anime but their role is opposite, demons are good and angels are evil. There are lots of demonic imagery, such as pentagrams.\\n\\n\r\n* Does get slow in some places.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The Characters are very well designed, voiced and much more. \r\nI loved the plot, the characters. Especlity when Sebby always says 'I'm simply, one HELL of a butler.' This anime is very dramatic, I always cry every time whilst watching a episode. The end to this season 1 is very dramatic and sad. \r\nI got really into Black Butler, but slowly started to get bored a tiny bit. But it always cheers me up. Some of the characters in this show are based on real life people duringthe Victorian times. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is very historical, dramatic and sad. The only thing I disliked about this anime that some of the backgrounds are lacking with color. But it's ok, but I wouldn't say it's too great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 10/10 with this Anime.",

Magic girls. Yada yada yada. \"Black Butler\" comes along and gives you a good show with a great character in the lead, Sebastian Michaelis- the titular black butler and an original concept to go with it.\r\nSetting in Victorian, turn of the century, England, \"Black Butler\" gives us a great enviornment of stately mansions, the streets of London right out of Sherlock Holmes, and all the mystery and intrigue one might expect of such a location. Throw in asupernatural element involving a demon butler, reapers, angels, and Faustian covenants (that's fancy talk for a deal with the Devil) and you get one helluva an Anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty impressive at times and the soundtrack is full of classical-derived tunes and melodramatic, dark, choirs. They throw in humor, action, horror, drama and mix it all together for a splendid time in 24 episodes. Sub vs. Dub is a big fight here. The Japanese cast does the best job, but the English cast (doing their best English accents) gives the show the most authenticity. Daisuke Ono and J. Michael Tatum both own the role of Sebastian in Japanese and English, respectively. Honorable mentions go to Daniel Frederick as Grell Sutcliff (absolutely hilarious) in English and Junichi Suwabe as Undertaker in Japanese. Some really good performances on both sides here.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this show. Sebastian Michaelis stands out as one of my favorite characters of all-time. I love the time period and everything that goes with it. It's a really great show and very unique. Anime fans should consider this a must-watch.",

The characters and landscapes are very well designed. It's true that is a dark anime, and sometimes is difficult to say if it's good or bad, but I think colours are totally great.\r\nI would also like to say that the openings and endings are perfect for this anime, they give us more emotions when we are watching it, incredible! The musicsounds fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nAs you know, Ciel Phantomhive is the main character. He's 12 years old! And he is so brave! In my opinion, Ciel is one of the best characters in anime. We could say it's only a kid, but his personality is extremely good. Even if he hurts people and sometimes is cruel, he has also such a beautiful heart. Ciel also suffers a lot, but he always tries to go on. The other characters are okay too, but no one has the depth as this one.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed TOO MUCH this anime! It has a really good plot that makes you laugh, cry, be nervous and excited. And the end, OH MY LORD, IT'S BRILLIANT.\\n\\n\r\nI'm so grateful with this anime, it gave me the strenght I needed.

            "content": "Well. Honestly, where do I begin with Black Butler? This anime left me with so many mixed emotions I simply can't make sense of it all. \r\nI'll start with the positives, I suppose. These positives being what kept me watching despite the negatives. Most significantly: The art. This show is gorgeous. Though I won't lie and say many of the angles and styles aren't reminiscent of yaoi and BL, I also couldn't say that the animation was bad, or anywhere near. I particularly loved the outfit design. Especially Ciel's outfits, the main character. Well, not counting the dress. \r\nI also enjoyed the characters, especially Ciel.While in some cases he did seem like a pretty obvious fanservice character (and a thinly veiled definitely-not-shota), I liked him regardless. He's an incredibly stubborn character, which is frustrating, though I'd say that ultimately it's a frustration that adds to the experience of watching the show. Sebastian is a bit bland, but honestly, it would kind of spoil his character if he had any real depth. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the negatives. \\n\\n\r\nWell, the story premise is quite interesting. A ten year old boy who makes a deal with a literal demon, trading his soul for revenge? It's a great setup, but it all honesty it falls completely flat.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the episodes are filler, and consist of little battles to be fought that are never brought up again and serve no purpose to the overall story. Sometimes they're enjoyable, sometimes they're boring, but none of them are very satisfying. When the plot finally does kick in, it's fascinating! \\n\\n\r\nBut... it's also rushed, and confusing. Episode 24 left me with more questions than answers, especially with episode 25 completely ignoring what happened right before. I don't know if that's only true of the Netflix edition, but it was frustrating and confusing regardless. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, do I recommend this anime? Yes. \\n\\n\r\nWill I be watching season 2? Absolutely. \\n\\n\r\nWhy do I recommend it? It's enjoyable. Especially for anyone into guys. There's also some LGBT content--and I don't just mean the vague yaoi stuff. There's two characters hinted (well, more than hinted--it's pretty much confirmed) to be transgender. No spoilers, though. \\n\\n\r\nWhy will I be watching season 2? I've been roped in by these characters. I care about Ciel. For anyone who gets overly invested in emotional characters, I can almost guarantee this anime is for you in that regard.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji, or Black Butler, whichever you prefer, was a pretty good anime. It was the first anime I've ever watched and I'd like to say that it was a good choice. It was really good, but not too good to where I'd have expectations too high for other anime in the future. \r\nI'l start with the story for this review. The main protagonist of this anime, Ciel Phantomhive, is a twelve (later thirteen) year old earl living in London, England with his butler, Sebastian Michaelis, who happens to be a demon. (and a Gary Stu) Ciel made a contract with him when he was tenand during a terrible moment of his life. I can't say much more without any spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of this anime was really good and the animation was very fluent and smooth. (mostly) It also had some very good, sometimes catchy, songs in it's OST. The theme song was actually stuck in my head for months after I finished this season!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are mostly good in the anime, but because this was an anime and didn't directly follow the manga, the anime obviously didn't have as much character development as the manga did. But it did have some character development, especially near the end.\\n\\n\r\nCiel is a very relate-able and likable character, probably the most likable out of all of them. You will feel for him when seeing his darkest moments and you'll also understand his bitterness, which is a mere coating for him to mask his feelings that leave him vulnerable. Sebastian is also likable but not relate-able, so he's lower on the scale of favorites for me than Ciel.\\n\\n\r\nOne character that I particularly did not like was Elizabeth. I loved her in the manga, but in the anime she was flat out annoying. Maybe it was her high pitched voice, girly attitude, or her glomping Ciel who clearly hates it that made me hate her. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot and it had a nice ending besides the fact that the ending didn't have a reason. Overall I'd rate 7/10. I recommend this for fans of fantasy for sure though, because of the angels, demons, reapers, and more.",

What other show has a demon butler, a 13 year old boy seeking revenge, an angel as the main enemy, and a 14 year old snob drowning in his own greed? Whether this   anime has some humerous moments, it is obvious that funny is not what the creator intended for this original masterpiece. I thought it was slow at the beginning of both seasons, however, the plot line quickly picked up pace and thus, the story of Ciel Phantomhive became one of my favorites. It is definitely not an animeI would recommend for those looking for action/suspense/thriller. Yes, there are a handful of duels and its share of blood baths, but the plot line has more of a conceptual focus rather than a physical action focus. I loved the consistency of this anime. Famous quotes are always repeated, and the characters even have their signature gestures that make them unique and real. After all, what kind of anime would it be if they weren't?\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime to those looking to think outside the box ;)",

            "content": "To tell the truth, I haven't finished this, but that's because I'm a wimp and I like happy endings with flowers and butterflies (you can tell from the first episode that there aren't any flowers or butterflies here). I'm on episode 12 and I've read summaries of the other episodes. Some parts make me uncomfortable, it's very dark, and when watching this, I almost feel a sense of boredom.\r\nThe story is rather original and the plot is well thought out. It is very deep and dark, nothing for the faint-hearted. I love the mystery and the bits of foreshadowing, good stuff. I gave it a9, because the ending isn't very complete (I haven't watched it, but that's what I get from secondary sources).\\n\\n\r\nI liked the art. The animation was really good, and I loved Ciel's attire. I did think that Sebastian's lips were too sharp, and he looked a little bit TOO evil sometimes (I guess it's to be expected, he is a demon). There was WAY too much blood for my liking, but maybe it was necessary. I gave it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nI think that the music suited the anime very well, and caught the dark tones. The music set the mood well, but I think they used the tune of \"London Bridge Is Falling Down,\" way too much. I never liked that song. I gave it an 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were OK. Ciel was interesting, but it unnerved me that he acted so old at the age of 12. Elizabeth annoyed me, because her overwhelming carefree attitude (yes yes she was sad because Ciel was sad, it's devastating), contrasted drastically with Ciel's dark depth. The servants at the mansion were mostly used for comic relief, which also annoyed me. Sebastian's almighty-ness got to me when he was in the ice-carving contest. My favorite character was Grell, but I liked the Undertaker, and Pluto was quite adorable (as a human). At episode 12, I haven't seen much character development. I gave it a 7.\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the series, but after hearing so much of London Bridge in episode 11 and 12, and Grell having left without spending a day with Sebastian, I'm putting this on hold. After I read the summaries for the rest of the episodes, I'm thinking about abandoning this, not because it's not enjoyable, but I'm really not into dark plots. I gave enjoyment an 8 because, well, watching this made me unhappy, because of how dark this is. The comic relief provided by the servants almost seemed out of place. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I gave this a 7. I guess the total was less than the sum, but it was probably the feeling of indifference that I felt when watching this that made it so. I was a complete fan girl when Grell was there, and the Undertaker made me cackle, but other than that, and I couple of laughs and giggles, I didn't feel much for this. I had a problem with a 12 year old giving away his soul. I would recommend it if you like this kind of thing. People die in this, people are unhappy, no one can be trusted (except those comic relief characters), and almost everyone has a tragic past, it's a good series.",

The sub-plots' of this anime have the tendency to run like filler as the series progresses on, that's not to say that they are all bad but, for example, one that involves Indians and curry seems to be exeptionally irrelevent to the plot but it manages to suffice to entertain. There are quite a few twists that would have been very difficult to see coming but in the end the new plotdevelopments are convincing and not just random. \\n\\n\r\n*ART* - 10/10 - The animation of this anime flows beautifully and is not overly cartoonish like most and with the beautiful European setting it makes it all the more outstanding. It is extremely similiar to the animation in Death Note, it might just be the same studio. \\n\\n\r\n*SOUND* - 9/10 - The music in this anime is quite lovely at times while at other's it seems to stray from the Victorian setting, sounding too modern. But as a whole the music does not overpower the show itself which is what matters more. \\n\\n\r\n*CHARACTER* - 8/10 - The characters were good but they could have been better with some more development. One in paticular is one of the main characters' Ceil Phantomhive, his parent's death seems to be the only thing which is used to make the child from an innocent well, child, to a cold, hate drivin b******. Another example, Maylene, is just a clumsy maid stereotype. \\n\\n\r\n*ENJOYMENT* - 8/10 - The anime has a nice mix of a dark /dramatic story and humor, it doesn't leave you desperately waiting for something to break the tension since it is perfectly balanced. It held my interest very well and I rarely was bored. \\n\\n\r\n*OVERALL* - 9/10 - This anime makes it very easy to twist the relationship of Ciel and Sebastian in a homosexual way (Yaoi). I personally don't have anything against Yaoi but Sebastian happens to be potrayed as an older man while Ciel is a 12 year old kid, it might seem a little creepy to some. \\n\\n",

            "content": "In the beginning, I wasn't sure of what to expect. I typically go for the shojo and romance anime's but I absolutley LOVED Black Butler!!! It was very dark and myterious yet I kept watching more and more because it's so suspensful!\r\nThe plot is somewhat intricate. Ciel is a young noble who's parents were killed in a fire and after they died, he was kidnapped and tortured. He then meets Sebastian who is a demon. Sebastian and Ciel form a contract in which Ciel sells his soul to Sebastian so that Sebastian will kill all those who kidnapped and tortured Ciel. Each mission in eachepisode shows each of Sebastians hidden strengths in what he goes through to protect his master, Ciel. Ciel matures much throughout the series and backstories about each member living in the Phantomhive household are revealed. Although this anime is dark, there are quite a few moments where you can't help but laugh.\\n\\n\r\nI watched the Funimation dub and I thought they did an outstanding job with their dub. If anyone has seen Ouran High School Host Club, Sebastian is voiced by the same man who voices Kyouya Ootori. I thought his voice fit perfectly with Sebastians character. Also, if anyone has seen Romeo x Juliet, the lady who voices Juliet does a fabulous job with the voice of Ciel Phantomhive. If anyone has seen Fruits Basket, Lau is voices by the same voice actor as Kyo Sohma!\\n\\n\r\nThe art was beautiful, a bit Lolita-esque. The animators really grasped a feeling of this 19th century Victorian time era. The animation is very crisp and clear and the colors are very descriptive help define the characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I completley enjoyed this anime, mainly because you have no idea what to expect! Its story is so different from the rest which makes it so unpredictable. I completley reccomend seeing it, ignore anyone who tells you otherwise!",

I can say that this is one of a kind that give it a passionate fans, the demonic kind. However, you will find it amazing and believe me , it really confused me again to whom should I believe  to the demon or to the angel? You know I found the angel there as the villain and the demon the savior! What the hell? Well watch it for yourself.\r\nThe demon that I\u2019m saying is a butler, Sebastian Michaelis,the butler ofthe Earl Ciel Pantomhive, or lets just say the demon butler. Sebastian Michaelis is originally a demon, his young master Ciel made a contract to him when he had given a mark of a sin and the one who killed his parents which leaded him to do the said contract to make a revenge on them who made him suffered.\\n\r\nThe demon butler Sebastian forms a human body, which he needs to socialize to the human world and do his job to his master. He is like a shadow of his young master, whatever may happen he need to obey all the orders that was given to him. It is a must to fullfill even a single order. He sincerely devoted his loyalty to the Earl in exchange for the soul . He will be able to get that soul and body after the mission that Ciel Pantomhive need to finished.\\n\\n\r\nthis review can also be seen in my wordpress\\n\r\nirock7444.wordpress.com",

The anime is a little dark, and ciel's butler seems very sinister, so it kind of felt like there was a thing between ciel and his butler, although nothing happened. So if you don't like that kind of stuff, then don't watch it. Very enjoyable characters, but the end was kind of depressing. Every character had a background that the show elaborated on, but not too much that itwent away from the original story. I'd say though if you get depressed easily, don't watch it, at least not to the very end.  I hope you'll like it as much as I did. ^^",

Then, there are a few twists added in. \r\nThe first one is when you meet a blue haired girl in one of the episodes. Then, you see that the queen has a butler that looks similar to her. The two play a surprisingly important part and if you've watched the whole first season, you know exactly what happened. \r\nThe end was, of course, the most exciting part. You know exactly why the queen never showed upout of the castle, who the girl and boy are, and how well Sebastian really does as a demon and a butler. It ties the whole thing together in a really exciting way. You can also see what Ciel would do if Sebastian wasn't around.",

            "content": "Where do I start talking about perfection? It's so hard to talk about it. The story is set in Victorian England (XIX century) * - * The plot involves demons, contracts, angels, death gods among other eccentricities. Ciel Phantomhive, a 13 year-old is a young (too young) boss of family. He had his dead parents in a fire in Phantomhive Mansion, and was forced to join a cult. Struck a deal with a demon, contract in which, Ciel gave his soul in exchange for carrying out his revenge. This demon was appointed by Ciel as \"Sebastian Michaelis,\" his current butler who was in charge oftaking care of his revenge, so after realizing it, his soul is ready to be eaten. Ciel also has the title \"The Dog of Queen \", it takes care of the issues \"dirty\"  in the crown with the help of his more than perfect butler, who performs flawlessly and the top speed the orders of his  master . A fabulous character appears later in the anime, just do not talk about it, because I do not like giving spoilers. Ciel has a style of \"dark hero\", which attracts me. He \"fight\" for their ideals, and that revenge is carried out; Machiavelli: The ends justify the means. That is, everything he does, even kill a inocete, is justified by its thirst for revenge. The anime does not have a boring air of \"happily ever after\", which also pleases me, because it makes it more unpredictable.",

I mean, parts of it were REALLY good, and parts of it were... confusing at best. I didn't know what the main plot was about until 5/6 episodes (I don't remember exactly). While interesting as a mystery show meanwhile, it didn't really caught my interest until the main plot was revealed. Afterwards, I was quite hooked. So I gave it a solid 8/10.\r\nThe art was the thing that drew me to the series in the first place. It's very pretty, to be frank,and I might be falling short with an 8/10. I really liked the character designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was quite interesting in itself. It complemented the show very well. Another solid 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters... I'm not sure. While maybe I'm not a fan of Sebastian, the other characters are well developed. I particularly enjoyed the stories of the Ciel's staff. Each of them had a short but interesting back story. A 7/10 is fitting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 8/10. Like I said, I didn't really became hooked until after the main plot is shown. Otherwise it was really enjoyable, except for a few moments of unnecessary shota undertones. I'm not really interested in that and found it a bit creepy sometimes. I might be biased though, because, after the art, the thing that made me watch it was the dark Victorian-age London setting. I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10.",

            "content": "The beauty and elegance that the characters, environment and overall animation hold will sweep anyone off of their feet at first glance. And it\u2019s surely certainly enough to keep one enticed. But let\u2019s step back and look at it critically for a moment and discuss the good and the bad.\r\nThe Bad: -Kuroshitsuji essentially doesn\u2019t have much of a plot. You get a couple hints of it at the beginning, so you get some idea of what it is. However, for most of the anime you watch many filler arcs that - while entertaining \u2013 are not related to the plot {for the most part}.The anime gets really intense about 6 {estimating} episodes before the end, and it felt a little rushed.\\n\\n\r\n- It\u2019s a little unrealistic. A friend of mine and I were discussing it, and we realized that no one \u2013 passersby, other servants, etc \u2013 stopped to look at Sebastian and go \u201choly balls, your eyes are red, you should get that looked at\u201d and suspected him of being supernatural.\\n\\n\r\n- Kuroshitsuji was a yaoi tease the whole time. I would be lying if I said that the relationship between Sebastian and Ciel wasn\u2019t borderline homoerotic. Now, Yana Toboso also created a yaoi before making Kuroshitsuji {Rust Blaster}. So she had full intentions of making Yaoi puns and teasers. However, there are no \u201csuccessful\u201d yaoi scenes. If you\u2019re the type that can\u2019t stand to be teased, with pretty people, then this might bother you a little more than it should.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Good: - It\u2019s pretty. I don\u2019t know what else I can say about it. The people are pretty, the scenery is pretty, the way everyone and everything moves is beautiful. It\u2019s definitely one thing that keeps you watching\\n\\n\r\n- Yana Toboso did her research. Most of the characters followed the fashion of Victorian England, and while I can\u2019t remember some little specifics that pertained to the setting, they were pretty accurate. It\u2019s nice to know that there are artists that don\u2019t portray history obscenely.\\n\\n\r\n- It\u2019s actually quite comedic. Almost all of the characters are lovable and mesh well together. I swear, I almost keeled over and died a couple of times because of the ridiculous things that Sebastian does. With most of the plot being filler, it\u2019s something nice to keep around and watch if you don\u2019t know what to watch or have nothing better to do.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion: - Story 7/10: As stated before, most of it was filler, but entertaining. The little plot that was rushed in was original. The idea of a demon serving someone in exchange for their soul isn\u2019t all that common. And all of the servant\u2019s backstories are touching. However, even at the end of the anime, there are some loose ends that they didn\u2019t tie up. Which in turn prompts you to watch Kuroshitsuji II.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound 9/10: Musically speaking, it has a classical/jazzy soundtrack with a dash of Latin choir, which might not appeal to or annoy some people. The soundtrack was actually done by one of my favorite Japanese composers, Taku Iwasaki {Also did the music for Soul Eater}. So I might be a tad biased. But for those who appreciate it, the music is very well put together. As far as the voices go, I cannot stress this enough; DO NOT WATCH DUB, WATCH SUB!!!! While I appreciate the consideration for the fact that they\u2019re in England, the voices don\u2019t match the characters and the British accents are bad, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters 10/10: All of the characters are lovable. The two sides to all of the main and secondary characters are a neat twist and come in handy. Yana Toboso really thought them through and gave them good character development, which made a moment when someone was asked to do something out of character all the more comedic. They all have specific traits about them, which make them unforgettable and difficult to mix up with other characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re the type that likes to know what\u2019s going on, then you should definitely give this one a chance {I suggest watching it and reading the manga as a paired up project}. It\u2019s for the people that love darker, out of the ordinary plots, and everything Victorian. It\u2019s definitely not cutesy and to say it\u2019s an eyesore would be an insult. Something as entertaining as this deserves more recognition.",

This amazing anime focuses on what happens when a sexy demon butler slowly yet patiently hunts for his prey. Long story short, Sebastian ends up getting himself into a world of unexpectancies that he never EVER expected. This anime is filled with SO many sexy characters that women and/or men will get wet between the legs over them. Even the blood shed is amazing! Sebastian and Claude give off a  legendary sexiness. They give off so much love andsweet tenderness every time an anime lover watches this anime! The characters in this anime are absolutely perfect. But, the one problem that I had in this anime is that it did not follow the manga at all. I mean it did but, some of the manga that could've been in season one ended up in season two. It really did confused me. *sulks* But, overall the anime was a job well done! I  would keep watching it over and over again until I die in a  delightful grave! If there is anyone looking for a good anime to watch, this is a MUST SEE! \\n\\n\r\nArigatou!",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT FOR BOTH THE ANIME AND THE MANGA!! \r\nSo! I finished the anime a couple of days ago. \r\nMy expectations for this anime were huge! Mainly cuz the manga is one of the best manga series I have ever read, and cuz everyone all over the internet and conventions love it! \r\nI will be comparing the anime adaptation to the manga in this review! If you don't like me doing that then read another review! You have been warned!!\r\nAnd btw, I have only watched season 1 since Kuroshitsuji II just seams to stray way too far from the manga to me. \r\nSo what didI think? \\n\r\nIt was such an insult to the characters and the brilliant mangaka that I wanted to throw up! \\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS \\n\r\nCiel is even more bitter in the anime than in the manga. The thing I really like about him is that he is harsh and always stays true to his goal, but he can also lighten up when he is around the right people. In the anime he is just cold! They try to make him a bit caring for Lizzy, but that fails in my book. \\n\\n\r\nThe quarrels between Ciel and Sebastian are pretty much gone. I loved how Ciel tried to get Sebastian on his feet and wanting to see him defeated, and Sebastian would get back at him in some funny way. \\n\\n\r\nLizzy is nothing but annoying. In the manga she is really annoying till you get the reason WHY! She gets badass later on! In the anime they never get that far, the only thing she does is to get kidnapped and then so nothing. \\n\\n\r\nI have many problems with Sebastian as well, but that has to do with the plot, let's get back to that! \\n\\n\r\nEveryone else are pretty much the same I guess, but they never get the time to develop the characters since they only had 12 episodes. The 3 servants only get 1 episode for their background stories and such. This is really a shame since you never get to fully see how badass they can be or get to hear all of their stories. And what they've done to Tanaka is just weird o_o' he has a time limit to be normal? This didn't really play any part. Most of my favorite characters didn't even make it in. \\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY \\n\r\nSo. . . . . . . NOTHING IS CORRECT HERE!! (Ok maybe the arc with jack the ripper) \\n\r\nI know that the anime is an adaptation and that changes has to be made, and sometimes I think it's way better that way. But when it ruins the entire plot and the characters all together. . . . NOPE! \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is that an angle have some sort of task to purify Ciel and the world! This ruins pretty much everything, I really don't think that an antagonist is needed to this story. The characters interact in other ways and the story is for a big part out of the picture. The manga is mostly arcs about random stuff that gradually move closer to Ciel's past. Here they felt like they needed a plot with an end to it, so they threw in an angel and ruins the contract! And that was my main problem. They ignores what the contract is! The main point of the series is the bond between Ciel and Sebastian. Sebastian might not like it, but the contract forces him to do anything Ciel says! In the anime the contract has an end of some sort. When his \"Goal\" (not the same as in the manga) is accomplished Sebastian may take his soul, just like that! Something they mention many times is \"I will follow you until death\" problem is that here it doesn't seam like it at all. And Ciel isn't fully dead at the end either. Yeah, he dies. . .yeah. . \\n\r\nThe queen is so devastated about her husbands death that she accepts to be purified by the angel and get a younger body that is a mix between hers and her dead husbands bodies. . . .Creepy! I like how she is devastated, but in a fun way in the manga. And not crazy! \\n\\n\r\nMy biggest problem though was close to the end, when Sebastian just ignores the contract, questions and leaves Ciel, and then just does nothing. Honestly, I never cared to listen to why he did that, the only thing is that like I said before, the contract is completely ignored. And then you have to sit through 2 episodes of Ciel being all powerless! He is Earl Phantomhive, he is not supposed to look all powerless! It completely ruined his character. He is vulnerable in the manga too, but he quickly gets stronger again, like he has more determination. \\n\\n\r\nLike I started out, the arc with Jack the ripper is very well played! It is very beautiful and emotional. I really liked what they did with the cinematic record! The arc after that with the Indian prince -insert name here- and the curry contest was about to be good also! But they ruined it by getting Mina involved. She gets possessed by something and people go nuts. It's not at all as smooth as the event in the manga where the queen shows up to judge the contest, Sebastian winning, the prince getting hurt by Mina hating him, crying his eyes out to Ciel and then they just end it on a happy note! I loved that arc in the manga btw. It was at this point that I started thinking in the anime \"Ok, what the heck are they planning to do with this!?\" \\n\r\nThe arc with Lizzie and the dolls was so forgettable to me that I, well, forgot about it!\\n\\n\r\nThis is all opinion based, as it always is when it comes to anything!\\n\\n\r\nAnd I know that I completely compare it to the manga, and that might not be fully fair. But the manga is such a masterpiece that it's really hard not too! In all honesty though, I don't think I would have liked the anime even if I had not read the manga. It gets way to confusing and screws way too much with the contract. \\n\\n\r\nComparing it too the manga I give it 2/10. It had a very good start, a very confusing and weird middle part and a horrible ending. \\n\\n\r\nNot comparing it too the manga I give it a 5/10 Some arcs were good, it had beautiful animation and could be very intense! But it still lacks when it comes too keeping the characters up. \\n\\n\r\nI will now go eat an ice cream. . . cuz I can! \\n\r\nThanks for reading, have a good one!",

            "content": "Black Butler was definitely  one of the darkest animes I've watched to date. Since I have nothing else to compare it to I will try to be as fair and impartial as possible (since I do favour comedies and dramas). \r\nTo summarize, Black Butler (Kuroshitsuji) takes place in Victorian-Era Great Britain and stars the young Ciel Phantomhive, whom through the tragic loss of his parents has literally \"made a deal with the devil\" to seek revenge on those at fault. He strikes a deal with a demon named Sebastien; in exchange for being his right hand man in his journey for revenge, he willgive up his own soul for Sebastien to consume when all is said and done. They work together in investigating cases assigned to them by the Queen while maintaining their true revenge objectives, using anything and anyone to obtain their goals. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThe setting made the story quite interesting, as the Victorian era was a time of lots of folklore, making the tales and antics of demons, ghosts and curses absurd but believable. What fascinated me was that the endings of each episode were pretty predictable, but there were many twists and turns along the way that were unexpected. One of my biggest complaints in the first half of the anime was the misplacement of humor or comedy in the middle of serious scenes. It happened very frequently and made those serious moments feel very anticlimactic. The ending is probably one of the best I have seen in any anime as it was something that was not really a surprise but was still filled with excitement, joy and sadness at the same time. This is definitely not a feel good anime and really doesn't show any redeeming qualities for most relationships, often showing betrayal, deception and resentment. But hey, life sometimes dishes that out so its nice to see everything isn't cherry blossoms and sunshine all the time. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime had beautiful art and animation. The character designs were very well done, especially with Sebastien. Maybe it was just me, but he stood out in EVERY scene he was in. Even though it was supposed to be a dark anime, there are times of beautiful bright colors; my favorite scenes actually being when there was snow and sunsets. They gave a particular feeling of warmth which was a nice addition and maybe even break from the dark themes :) \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5/10\\n\r\nCiel and Sebastien are a great team and their relationship both confused and fascinated me. Ciel at times could be quiet annoying but he is a 12-year rich kid so it was to be expected :p. Sebastien is one of the most complex characters I have ever seen. He often made me forget what his true motives were as he seemed devote and loyal. But after episode 17 you truly see he will DO ANYTHING to obtain his goal and it was disturbing to see (which I think was the point). I can't help liking him despite his motives which probably is a reflection of his good looks but also his interactions with the servants in the home who act as the comedic relief. All of the servants were likable, my favorite being Tanaka :D Such a cute old man!! The only characters I disliked (whom we were supposed to actually like) was Lizzie, Ciel's fianc\u00e9e, whom I thought was truly annoying in most cases. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes were great and the second half of the anime did have themes that stood out. But I think the story drew me in so much at times that I did not notice the music at all. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 \\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI think it was a great anime with a great ending worth waiting for. For those who like darker anime or some yaoi, this is definitely an anime for you. This is definitely an anime more for women since there are so many yaoi moments and fan service but the action scenes I think would definitely appeal to fans of action as well. This is an anime I would definitely recommend as Sebastien truly is \"one hell of a butler\" ;) and really made it worth watching.",

The story is filled with unexpected turn-of-events, tear-jerking moments, as well as laugh-out-loud moments and of course of nice dose of action. The characters are all unique in their own ways and, most of them, you can't help but to love. Althought it is pointed towards a female audience, with bishonens and yaoi snippets, it can also be enjoyed by a male audience. The dark atmosphere, accompanied by exceptional artwork and music, will probably be enjoyed especially by fans of darker animes. But, overall, Kuroshitsuji is a great series that youshould not overlook! ^.^",

            "content": "After numerous requests from the worst fanboys, I decided to give a chance to this series because of the interesting plot and character's desing.\r\nFrom this point of view the anime is well done, with a cast characterized and stylish but that, at least according to my personal point of view, errs in the evolution, especially for secondary elements, and makes it less convincing and addictive . Another major flaw worth mentioning  is the presence of too many unnecessary episodes also in the final parts of the plot, in which it would be right and lawful push a little 'more on the accelerator to enticethe viewer and immerse completely in the events, finishing for get bored and wonder why it was given so much space to this kind of episodes,even considering the nature of these anime,the black comedy. Closing the topic on episodes\u2019 management, I want to further criticize the decision to exclude the narrative arcs that in the plot could do good, and then make room for boredom masterpieces like the one dedicated to the Indian Butler and Prince Soma, which excluding the culinary challenge vaguely reminiscent of Food Wars, it is useless and somewhat avoidable.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the plot, however, we are facing  a well written story with a very original underlying idea, that every time brings our beloved characters to shed light on court\u2019s mysteries and solve cases like real investigators. If this anime\u2019s part captures the attention and leads to continuing the vision to find the culprit and the motive of the crime, the continual solving these misdeeds blocks the flow of the real plot, which leads to a villain\u2019s presentation in the anime\u2019s closing stages and a hasty unfolding of events, that does not help in the rating.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, anyway, there are respectable animations with appreciable drawings, both for the author's obvious personality that shines through in every lineament, but also for the originality that nowadays is hard to find.\\n\\n\r\nHonorable mention for the ending and the final episode itself, which concludes perfectly the first season of Kuroshitsuji, offering striking and exciting scenes that I liked a lot. In the general despair and chaos within London, we see Ciel increasingly determined to implement his revenge,even when all is lost and nothing remains, driven by hatred and frustration, the main themes of this anime. The Earl and the butler Sebastian\u2019s final stages are also beautiful, that contributes to strengthen the bond of friendship between them, gaining in characterization and character development, and giving an unique touch of class with deep reflections and very significant scenes.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, arguing on the setting, I cannot avoid showing me pleased and surprised with this Gothic style,that I love in all its gorges,and a realistic and commendable Victorian London\u2019s scenario, really proving the main advantage of this anime. Continuing the discourse on the artistic side, this anime also affects for the care given in the soundtrack with a fantastic opening and, albeit with a first undertone ending, a really magnificent and full of atmosphere closing song (Lacrimosa),that can not be skipped.\\n\\n\r\nSumming up, Kuroshitsuji is an anime that I would highly recommend to all of those who love black comedies and those who want to approach something that stands out from the crowd for its originality and personality, detectable in the character\u2019s design and in the magnificent gothic environments that are the anime\u2019s main dishes.\\n",

Don't get me wrong, the characters were great, but I feel like you'd have to read the manga to really get your money's worth on the storyline. \r\nEssentially, there were many differing bits of story throughout the entire season that didn't really fit together. I understand the overall point and meaning of the story, but it just wasn't executed all that well.\r\nThat being said, the characters in this anime are some of the best I've seen in this genre. However, their backgrounds weren't really touched on as muchas I would've liked them to be, and in fact, the parts of them we did see didn't make much sense in the grand scheme of the season. \\n\\n\r\nProbably the one thing that was simultaneously the most confusing and most interesting about this anime was Ciel and Sebastian's relationship.

This must be one of the reasons why the storyline of this anime was all over the place. But let's judge this anime on its own, ignoring the fact it was mostly non-canon. For me, I felt confused at times while watching because I couldn't understand the storyline, like what exactly was the plot. The characters were so thinly portrait that you couldn't really relate or understand their motives. However, I must admit I liked the anime before I read the manga because I foundit entertaining even though I couldn't get on board with the storyline. And it seems the anime redeem itself with the movies, where the plot was similar to the manga. So if you want an anime to watch for fun, I'll give this a go.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji, as well called Black Butler, is an anime based on the manga \"Kuroshitsuji\" by Yana Toboso. It was directed by Toshiya Shinohara and produced by A-1 Pictures. The anime derives from the original story of the manga, but it was Yana Toboso who still created the story of the anime.\r\nSummary:\r\n\"In Victorian-era Europe, a young boy loses everything he once held near and dear to a vicious plot. In his moment of death, he strikes a deal with a demon: his soul, in exchange for revenge. Ciel Phantomhive is now the head of the Phantomhive corporation, handling all business affairs as well as the undergroundwork for the Queen of England. His new partner is a demon butler, Sebastian Michaelis, whose powers as a butler is only surpassed by his strength as a demon.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows the two along with their other servants, as they work to unravel the plot behind Ciel's parents' murder, and the horrendous tragedies that befell Ciel in the month directly after.\" (source : kissanime.com)\\n\\n\r\nStory (10)\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a dark fantasy that mixes well mystery and humor. The dialogues are funny and well written. Sometimes here and there unexpected scenes but that doesn't make the anime less fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9)\\n\\n\r\nBeautiful artwork in my opinion. This of course depends on each person but A-1 Pictures did a great job finding this anime his \"own style\". The clothing of the era is very well drawn despite it's surrealistic story. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9)\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors ar well chosen. Their voices suite really well with thei character and do a great job impressioning them.\\n\r\nAs for the background music, it is in the style and I didn't get a feeling like \"oh, this shouldn't be here\". The openings and endings are also well chosen and some of them can be catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10)\\n\\n\r\nEach character had their own characteristic (that makes them easy to remember). They don't really change throughout the story (even if sometimes you might get that impression) but it doesn't really matter for the plot. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement (10)\\n\\n\r\nLike I stated before, it's mysterious and fun at the same time so yeah, believe you will laugh. The suspence is well build and when you think \"oh this is solved\" you get another question... So it isn't boring for sure, and very enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (10)\\n\\n\r\nI thought it was a very outstanding anime, surely one of my favorites. Good story, amazing characters, nice artstyle... \\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, hope this was helpfull and picked your curiosity! ^^ \\n",

If you want the whole thing (which I recommend), watch this, then Kuroshitsuji II and then Book of Circus. The story in this was very well done, being a story that kept me thoroughly engaged throughout the entire binge- I mean, watching session. It never got too slow, but kept up a good level of action and believable, yet unpredictable twists and turns throughout. The9/10 is justified in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in this anime is quite well done, smooth animation, coupled with a good drawing style, and consistency is a wonderful thing to have. 9/10 for art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack was pretty good for this anime, nice OP and ED, as well as some good OST in the background. 8/10 for sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Grell is the single-most best thing I have ever experienced and with the best VA, Jun Fukuyama, he definitely had a wonderful time to shi-\\n\\n\r\nSorry, fangirled too hard again. Keeping a more composed review, I was glad to see a return of my favourite VA in a fun new character, that I greatly enjoyed and believed was a fun spot of comic relief every now and again. The main cast is also developed quite well, as mysteries surrounding the mysterious past are unfolded and you learn that everything is not as it seems or as you initially anticipated within the Earl of Phantomhive's mansion. I really like the voice cast for majority of the main characters and believe that this deserves it's 9/10 for characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The enjoyment for me was a perfect 10/10. I found the pacing of the story was quite good, never getting too slow and always making me want to see more. I don't have too many bones to pick with this anime, from an enjoyment point of view.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I really enjoyed this anime and think that it ended quite perfectly, summing up everything with no loose ends, it is definitely something that I would recommend, but I do understand that it is not for everyone, and some view it as a primarily teen girl demographic, despite it's shounen tag. I would not like to throw my hat into the ring for that argument, but I will say that I can understand both sides' reasonings. Overall a good anime, 9/10.",

            "content": "The frustrating thing about creating an adaptation is that no matter how hard you try, you\u2019re inevitably going to end up straying from the original source material.\r\nYou can use that phrase to start off reviews for the majority of anime on this site, because nearly every anime adaptation, no matter how faithful, has a few differentiations from the manga or light novel it\u2019s based on.\r\nHowever, once in a while, you get an anime that ends up drifting so far from its source that it eventually spins off into a completely new direction, to the point where the two hardly feel like the same story anymore.This is exactly what Black Butler is like. I\u2019ve been a fan of the manga for quite some time before I decided to check out the anime. It was the creative use of the Victorian setting, dark themes, and colorful cast of characters that pulled me into the series as I read. Even though I knew that the anime and manga were different, I didn\u2019t realize how different they actually were until I watched the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime begins following the manga well enough. The first few episodes essentially cover the first few chapters of the manga. Our first arc, the Jack the Ripper Arc, is actually covered rather flawlessly. The feelings Yana Toboso wanted you to experience are perfectly translated into the anime. You develop a strong desire to find Jack the Ripper\u2019s true identity. You laugh hysterically at Ciel wearing a dress. Your spine chills at the reveal of Grell Sutcliffe. Your heart breaks listening to the devastating backstory of Madame Red. You get a better understanding of Ciel\u2019s character when the arc ends.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as the show progresses and new story arcs come and go the plot begins to fall apart. None of the other arcs really hold a candle to the Jack the Ripper Arc. The show tries to tie all the arcs together, but it does this in a completely unsatisfying way. For example, in one arc, they are supposed to investigate a weird church. They do that for about half an episode, then all of a sudden the main villain appears and the church is never brought up again.\\n\\n\r\nNot even the other arc adapted from the manga, the Curry Contest Arc is particularly good. It feels very rushed, like they weren\u2019t interested in adapting it, but needed to in order to introduce the characters Soma and Agni. It cuts some rather major events from the manga version. Worst of all, it does a poor job portraying the character Soma. The anime puts way too much emphasis on his spoiled bratty side. Of course, this is an aspect of his character in the manga, but it\u2019s hardly the defining feature.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a rather major issue in the anime. The story arcs become less about developing the characters they\u2019ve already introduced, and more about adding new characters and story elements in an attempt to make the show seem edgier. Because of this, there is a depressing lack of character development among the side characters. Most of them aren\u2019t shown to the full potential they are capable of. I realize they can only adapt what was actually published at the time, but they could have at least talked to Yana Toboso to discuss what direction she was planning on taking with these characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst example of this is Grell Sutcliffe. I mentioned earlier how intimidating he was when he was first introduced in the Jack the Ripper Arc. After that arc though, pretty much every appearance he makes is a huge flop. Part of the reason for this is how frequently he appears. In the manga, Grell doesn\u2019t appear after the Jack the Ripper Arc for over 10 volumes. In the anime, he appears all the freaking time and has absolutely no impact on the story at hand. He\u2019s reduced to a perverted mess who lusts after Sebastian or whatever other man he happens to see. He only gets in the way, taking away precious time that could have been spent focusing on developing something else.\\n\\n\r\nPluto, the demon hound who doesn\u2019t appear in the manga is another worthless character, except unlike Grell, he was never likable to begin with. His sole existence in this show is to provide fanservice to the yaoi fangirls, so they can squee with delight as he jumps onto Sebastian or Ciel while butt naked. He does nothing even slightly amusing in the showl, and the arc that introduces him is probably the weakest in the show.\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019d probably assume that from the scathing comments I make towards the story and characters that I really hate this anime. Actually, I don\u2019t. In fact, the overall time I spent watching this anime was definitely an enjoyable one. Even though the anime doesn\u2019t do a very good job adapting what was in the manga, it still has a \u201cBlack Butler\u201d feel. Sure, the mood is completely different, but there are definitely some positive elements to it. So let\u2019s talk about the good now.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, there\u2019s Ciel. Ciel is a great character, and the anime does a good job showing this. He\u2019s not some stuck-up snobby kid, nor is he totally dependent on Sebastian, which a lot of people might think he is. He\u2019s perfectly capable of defending himself. He\u2019s cunning, manipulative, resourceful, and not afraid to get his hands dirty. But underneath, he really is a good person. He genuinely cares about all of his friends and servants and though he\u2019s bossy, he\u2019s not cruel. Ciel is someone who really does want to do the right thing; he just tries not to show it.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure I can say Ciel really \u201cdevelops\u201d in the sense that he learns lessons and grows into a different person. Rather he \u201cdevelops\u201d in the sense that the events of the show reinforce who Ciel is as a character. The best example of this is near the end. Basically, when confronted with the opportunity to forget his past, Ciel says he can\u2019t, and that he needs to hold onto his past because it is the hatred he has for those that killed his parents that have made him into the person he is. I found this to be a pretty valid reason.\\n\\n\r\nSebastian was also a character I enjoyed. He\u2019s mysterious, and the dynamic between him and Ciel is explored fascinatingly. While he\u2019s obedient to Ciel, you can tell that he\u2019s not particularly loyal. You\u2019re never sure what\u2019s going on through his mind, but the show doesn\u2019t want you to know. Though he is perfect at nearly everything he does, he doesn\u2019t seem like an idealized Mary Sue. And the sarcastic and somewhat passive-aggressive way he talks is quite amusing. Though he doesn\u2019t have much depth, he\u2019s very likable and easy to root for.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the character of Angela, a character exclusive to the anime. I\u2019m not really sure why though, because she\u2019s not particularly deep nor is she very interesting. Her character is never explored, nor are her motivations explained at all. Why is she doing what she\u2019s doing? What is she trying to accomplish? It seems like acts more for the hell of it rather than any real reason. I think I like her more for what she is, rather than who she is. Overall though, she\u2019s an interesting addition, and I would love seeing her in the manga, granted with some more depth.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals in this anime are incredibly impressive. The setting portrayed in the manga is animated spectacularly well. The backgrounds are detailed beautifully, and the animation flows smoothly. The dim lighting and gothic character designs helps contribute to the mood of the anime immensely. It does a fantastic job depicting a somber atmosphere. What particularly impresses me is how much effort they put into the historical accuracy. Obviously, they took some creative license, but you can tell that they did as much research as they possibly could in order to portray London as best as they could. The only thing I didn\u2019t like was how obvious it was that they used CG for the horse drawn carriages. They stand out too much. I realize that it was probably cheaper, but come on; horses can\u2019t be that hard to animate in 2D.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very fitting for this time period. Not all of it is typical classical baroque-esque music like you\u2019d expect, though there is a good share of it. Even the more modern music in incorporates into the background fits the scene well. The OP is a great song. It\u2019s catchy and it relates to the show well. The first ED is also a great song and the video for it is fantastic, though I\u2019m not sure how well it fits the anime. Meanwhile, the second ED, sung by Kalafina, is beautiful. It\u2019s slow paced, mysterious, and it relates to the show lot better, especially as the show gets darker.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the English dub is fantastic. I\u2019ve heard a lot of criticism that they don\u2019t properly use the correct accents, but as an American, I never noticed. Even if they didn\u2019t bother to use accents at all, you could tell that the voice actors put a lot of effort into this dub, and they really enjoyed it in the process. Brina Palencia was a perfect choice for Ciel. Her voice is flat, but not emotionless; exactly the kind of character Ciel is. Meanwhile, J. Michael Tatum does a fantastic job as Sebastian. His seductive voice captures the essence of the character excellently, and his tone adds a lot to the character\u2019s witty humor.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s difficult to pin my overall thoughts on Black Butler, because I don\u2019t hate it, but I don\u2019t think I like it all that much either. While the visuals and sound is nice and Ciel and Sebastian are handled exceptionally well, the rest of the cast and story are heavily downplayed and do not do the manga justice. It\u2019s not necessarily the fact that it doesn\u2019t directly adapt the manga that hurts it. It\u2019s the fact that what they replaced it with just isn\u2019t that good.\\n",

Despite his pessimist attitude, he has a past clouded with mystery, and his secrets are more complex than you can ever imagine. He is bound to a demon butler who's trying to eat his soul, but he plays this to his advantage, seeking revenge on those who hurt him. Ciel is fun to watch but I sometimes wish he would see how bright the world really was.\\n\\n\r\nSebastian Michealis, not your typical butler. His favourite quote is \"I am simply one HELL of a butler.\", which seems to be his favourite pun. He can go from evil to playful in a split second, and often seems to be protective of his master. However, don't be fooled, he is a demon, and seems to have no heart at all. He seriously just wants to devour Ciels soul. Thus you could call him a villian, yet a lot of the time you could call him the hero, protecting Ciel no matter what, even if it causes his own pain and anguish. A truly amazing character.\\n\\n\r\nThe servants don't seem to be sad or burdened servants at all. They are enthusiastic and all have their pasts that made them stronger and better, and are no longer hurt or afraid. They do there duty well and are very enjoyable characters to watch, especially Tanaka and Finny, who are my personal favourites.\\n\\n\r\nGrelle, the somewhat disturbed grim reaper, who finds fun in everything. I have been unable to decide whether I like him or not, however he makes me laugh, and that's something. Grelle is seriously one hell of a character.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters are also complex and amazing! The villians are not bigots, their opinions can almost be justified and their minds seemed to be wired in the perfect way to make them brutal and not easy to watch. That's a good thing. Characters like Lizzy and Madame Red almost brung me to tears, and the undertakers character is also hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum this character review up, all the characters in this series were, to put it frankly, awesome. Their words and history never cease to surprise me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9-\\n\\n\r\nThrought this show I was shocked, scared, happy, sad, and suspicious. The art was sweet, the music was lush, the characters were intruiging and I enjoyed it emmensely. I'm serious that if you watch Kuroshitsuji, you will not find a fantasy world, but more like a harsh reality full of messages and secret morals.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was amazing and I hope to find more like it ^^",

            "content": "As I began to watch this anime, I didn't have high hopes nor was I completely impressed with the first few episodes. But perseverance paid off, and I found the story to be quirky and enjoyable. \r\nWhen I thought they would go down a conventional plotline/reaction, there would suddenly be a twist that would make me laugh. Overall, this anime was kept very fresh throughout the episodes. There are some obvious filler episodes that became slightly boring, but the humor was enough to keep me from looking away. The characters, while cliche in their actions, have a sort of warm and fresh feel in suchthat you forgive them immediately if they do something predictable.\\n\\n\r\nThe artistry is beautiful. The background and settings can sometimes be breathtaking and the attention to detail is impressive.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing, I started on the second series, which could also be a bit of an OAV as well, Kuroshitsuji II. The first episode threw me off a bit as I thought that the main characters from the first series wouldn't be in it, but that wasn't so and the new plot line really had me hooked, the ending episodes are really worth it. \\n\\n\r\nI would say I think I enjoyed Kuroshitsuji II more than the first one, but I wouldn't have the attachment to the main characters I did if I hadn't watched the first series before. Overall, I recommend both to the age groups of about 12 to 35. It's kiddy enough that younger people will enjoy it, but witty and fast paced enough for the older generation looking for something new.",

            "content": "I'm not one for black people or butlers, but I found this show fantastic. Everything about it is so delicious and just saturated with really aggressive bass-lines. Takes place in London during the Victorian period, a time we all remember fondly and wish we could go back to. The main character is Ciel Phantomhive, with his parents killed he is now the head of his noble family, he is out to kill the people that killed his parents and  beat him naked with a cane or something. To accomplish his goal he makes a deal with a demon, Sebastian, who can do a bunchof demon shit and becomes his trusted butler that carries out his wishes. Ciel and Sebastian are extremely likeable and you want them to succeed, I won't go over the rest of the characters but the villains are really cool and jack the ripper is in it, though probably not what you'll be expecting. There is a really cool blend of comedy and action, you really won't know what to expect next as it is always switching from being funny to dead serious. This show's soundtrack is quite good and the art is very easy on the eyes, unlike cancer. You will like watching this show, I know you will. Because you are probably a retarded fourteen year old and have horrible taste, either that or you're a woman and have horrible taste in everything, stupid women. I didn't mean the last part, many women have great taste in entertainment among other things, I only put it in to get your respect.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji or Black Butler whatever you want to call it is amazing and I recommend you go watch it right now!\r\nI started watching it without reading anything about it, so I was basically clueless. But I was just lost in it as soon as I watched the first episode.\r\nThe story was amazing, a young boy and his demon butler, as soon as they make their contract the demon must serve his master and be there for him always, but when the time comes the demon shall devour his master's soul. (Sounds a bit like Death Note when you write it down.)\r\nI loved all the arcsespecially the Jack The Ripper one. I loved the kind of twist there was with who was involved and how it all went down. I also loved the arc with the young girls being kidnapped and transformed into dolls. And pretty much all of the arcs. I wasn't a big lover of the hell hound arc but that was because I couldn't stand the scene with the dog being hurt by the evil dogs. (But that's just how I am with all scenes like that) \\n\\n\r\nThe art was interesting, the characters all looked amazing, especially Sebastian and Ciel. Finny was adorable and I loved how Mey Rin's glasses covered up her true beauty. When they showed her past at the start of an episode I didn't even know it was her. She looked so different. \\n\r\nGrell had the creepy look Grell needed (I'm still confused on Grell's gender) The backgrounds looked really nice all the time. The ending animation for the first ending song was cute and fun. The opening animation showed the creepy side to the anime, but it was really cool.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was really good. The background music was good and the voices were all really good too. I liked all the British accents too. I really liked the opening song and the first ending song.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were amazing. Each one stood out and they weren't easily forgotten. I loved Sebastian and Ciel. Elizabeth annoyed me but I think she's supposed to be annoying. The Phantomhive servants were all unique in their own crazy way and the villains were really enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Kuroshitsuji is really enjoyable and I highly recommend it. It's not what I was expecting, it was better and I personally can't get enough of the quote \"I'm simply one hell of a butler.\"",

            "content": "Black Butler Season 1 gets a 10 for being a great series. It is a Gothic / Occult Action and Black Comedy. The story is about a young noble who makes a Faustian deal with a Demoinc Butler who serves and protects him in Victorian Europe.The main character Ciel suffers tragedy of losing his parents as a child , since this , he is seeking revenge. The series goes through many supernatural adventures. \r\nFor those who like Holmisian mysteries , history ,traveling, folklore and mythology , you will enjoy this anime. It has some stereotypical humor, such as one of the servants having a monocle, which is a typical look for a gentleman in Victorian England. There is a lot of action , and fighting , as well as solving mysteries. You will encounter creatures , from Fallen Angels to Demons ,to Hellhounds , to ghosts and of course Grim Reapers. You will also encounter various historical references in this period, such as the Great Exhibition in London , and Queen Victoria herself . You will also encounter references to historical mysteries such as Jack the Ripper and the murder of Richard Duke of York , and Edward IV in the Tower of London. Overall these facts alone set the stage for what I believe to be one of the best anime in the mystery of genre to date.",

This is by far my favourite anime, I felt like I knew the characters so well and the morals of the show were very fresh to me. \r\nI started off watching shoujo romance anime, and then started watching darker themed animes like this one. I love the underlying storyline and backstory of the characters and how they came about to how they are now. Whilst watching it, I became impressed by the art of the anime, the details that are put into the buildings, to theclothes are just amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThe story plot for me was extremely fresh, which is probably the reason why its my favourite anime. Like I said before, I felt so connected to the characters, thats probably why it stand out from other animes like SNK and Mirai Nikki - don't get me wrong, these 2 animes are excellent as well, its just a personal preference.",

It's eye candy 100%. \r\nHowever it is more than just art. \r\nThe characters are quite interesting, when you get to know them, which might as well take as much as the entire show. \r\nI think then evolution of the characters to similar to that of the Gundam 00 ones. Takes you an  entire season to find out how fucked up they are and the entire second season to warm up to them. Sadly enough, I think the second season of Kuroshitsuji hasa different line up. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty straight forward. Regardless of the usual amount of twists and turns, there are no jaw dropping revelations. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was, well nothing spectacular. I complimented the series without standing out, which is a good thing. \\n\\n\r\nI did drop this six episodes into it. One of the reviews I read compared it to Hellsing  so my expectations were a bit misplaced. As such, the happy end theme and the \"happy\" antics which composed the first half of the series were a bit of let down. But the visuals compelled me to rewatch it, taking it for what it was, and this time around I did enjoy it. \\n\r\nI would have loved this series to push it a bit. A bit more fighting, a bit more raunchiness, a bit more gritty. They make the jack the ripper crimes and opium dens look totally bland. \\n\r\nStill looking forward to season 2, will pro'lly pick up the manga as well and the rewatch it. \\n\r\nSo yeah, watch it. It is a decent series. \\n",

            "content": "I don\u2019t even know where to begin with this one. This review is painful even for me to write, because I would have to think about the show whenever I have to type. This show is probably one of the most famous and most talked about shows in anime history; probably because of the character design and the relationships of the different characters in the show (I don\u2019t even want talk about that one, as much as possible, seriously now.) But it\u2019s mostly because, no matter where you go, BLack ButLer (or Kuroshitsuji, for the people that know it better like that) is present ineverything and everywhere, both during the past and in the present .In the TV, in the web, in the magazines, BLack ButLer is always there, especially during the day it was being aired for the first time, although I have to admit that the hype died down during the past few years after it was first aired, but it sure as hell didn\u2019t left the spotlight without making a scar big enough to be seen by the different aspiring mangaka and anime makers that showcase the genre that started it all, BL (although it\u2019s not as rough as the other BL shows out there, and you can\u2019t really specifically call BLack ButLer BL because it\u2019s more of pseudo BL, it still feels appropriate if we did associate it with BL, for obvious reasons of course [at least they were sane enough to make it look subtle, yet provocative]). I am at least impressed that they serialized this show \u2018passionately\u2019, with evil smiles, and with an even more evil glare on the money, knowing that fans will bite it to the bone. (fan-girls to be specific. I\u2019ll be damned if I find a single fan-boy in this show, if there was, you have every right to throw me in hell for this statement. Just don\u2019t let Sebastian eat my soul. HAH! [I think I\u2019m going to be sick just making that joke...])\\n\\n\r\nBut enough of that for now, let us move towards the actual review. BLack ButLer, BB for short, \u201cis story about a boy that had lost everything he once held dear to him because of a conspiracy that grudges his family name. In his dying breath, he swore an oath to a demon. It will save his life and grant the boy\u2019s wish of vengeance to the conspirators, but in return, the boy\u2019s soul will be devoured by the demon when the wish is fulfilled.\u201d From the moment the quotation mark ended, you probably think that \u2018you know where this is going\u2019. I am here to make it double sure that it will end like how you think it will (and it is not going to be a happy ending, although I won\u2019t spoil what will happen). With that said, that pretty much summarizes the main plot itself, of course the small flash backs into the main character\u2019s past is always a good motivation to anyone that will watch this show for the plot, but it will probably be not good enough to drive most of the viewers, unless you have the will power of Ghandi, you\u2019re after the bishounen characters and the pseudo BL relationships to begin with, or you went for the bishounen characters and the pseudo BL relationships half-way of the show because the fillers just over-burdened you (I hope Ghandi lends his support to you, or else, you\u2019re f***ed). Speaking of fillers, be prepared to enjoy bishounen, pseudo BL fillers with this one, because, at least, 70% of the whole show (season 2 not included) is filler-hell. (THERE I SAID IT. IF YOU DON\u2019T LIKE FILLERS THEN STOP READING THIS REVIEW AND NEVER WATCH THIS SHOW, EVER! LEAVE WHILE YOU STILL CAN! [At least that\u2019s settled...] You\u2019re still here? *sigh*). Other than that, there\u2019s pretty much nothing to say here, other than his, sort of peaceful, everyday life being a rich noble English kid, with his demon butler that can do anything, his quirky servant trio (can\u2019t really call the old man a servant, he\u2019s not doing any house work), and his occasional visitors that pesters him in his daily work-life to do various activities that will mostly annoy him to death and have no relevant meaning to the plot whatsoever, although some of the small stuff does have a connection with the plot, it\u2019s not going to be anything major that you will remember it happening after finishing the whole show (considering that you did actually finished it). \\n\\n\r\nI will not talk about character design for this show because talking about it here would spoil the surprise installed for you when you watch the show, giving potential spoilers to people that are after the bishounen characters and pseudo BL relationships (also, character design in this one is too painful to describe in my point of view, given that I too have my fare share of bias, forgive the incompetence). Even though I said that, I will at least talk about character development. The funny thing about character development in this show is that there is barely any development. Little boy blue (balls) Ciel Phantomhive\u2019s personality never did change since the start of the show, and his BLack ButLer, Sebastian Michaelis, never did reveal a whole lot of personal stuff about himself, other than his constant bragging of how much of a godly-ass butler he is. The only solid development that happened in the story was with the people that got into Ciel\u2019s way. They all started out to be normal persons with different motives and interests, then all of a sudden, they became lunatics bent on killing Ciel due to personal issues. The main antagonist (which was not revealed until half of the entire show) did the most character development in the period of the show, showing him/herself that he/she\u2019s the type that believes that \u2018everything can be saved from hatred\u2019 and that \u2018ends must justifies it\u2019s means\u2019 then went power-hungry and started killing people for personal gain. The reason why I did say there was no character development for Ciel was because, when the story started, he had a back-story that revealed what he have been through. I can\u2019t really say that it was legit character development because that said event happened before the show started, and only appears as flash-backs, so it technically doesn\u2019t count as a development. Ciel, to be frank, started out to be a fully developed character already, which is not bad, but it still gave the impression that character development was flat with the main character.\\n\\n\r\nBack to BL, I mean BB. Personally, there are at least two things that I liked about the anime in general, the setting, and the opening and ending themes. I like how the story was put into the 1800\u2019s British Empire theme, with their snazzy buildings, inhumane interior house-hold designs, fashion sense (I\u2019m a bit reluctant to blurt that out, but it\u2019s still true anyway), and sleazy accents. But the opening and the ending theme (the second ending, to be exact) is hands-down, one of the best things I have heard in forever, since I started watching anime. I give credit to the two bands that did the OP and the ED of that show (even though I don\u2019t know their band names), they are awesome. If you don\u2019t know what I mean, then stop skipping the OP and the ED all the time, and start listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that concludes another review. If you ask me if I enjoyed watching the show, instinctively, I\u2019ll tell you I did not because, I\u2019ll be honest with everyone, I detest anything and everything that has a direct correlation with bishounen, BL, yaoi types, pseudo or not. Mainly due to a trauma I had to suffer after watching that one show that everybody keeps trapping in the internet that goes by the acronym BnP. Even now that show gives chill down the spine, enough to paralyze anyone in fear. And without further ado, I will now conclude the BL, I mean BB, review. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m now going to be busy writing those other stuff I\u2019m going to finish. For you see, I am simply one hell of a writer, heh. (Tightens noose)\\n",

            "content": "(This is my review on Black Butler (Kuroshitsuji) from my website)\r\nThis review is on the anime and NOT the manga, the series was the anime\u2019s own adaptation and did not feature in the manga.\r\nI will also be doing a review on Kuroshitsuji (Black Butler): Book of Circus at a later date.\r\n*CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\nDate released: Japan \u2013 October 2008 (America/England \u2013 January 2011)\r\nBreakdown:\r\nBlack butler is a show about a young boy called Ciel, who sells his soul to a demon named Sebastian so that he can exact his revenge for his family\u2019s death, also successfully lead their confectionary and toy company called Funtom. The demon that Cielmakes the contract with takes the form of his butler and is in the image of his father, he is very loyal to Ciel and is required to protect, serve and arrive whenever he is summoned by his master Ciel.\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion on Black Butler:\\n\\n\r\nLet me start by saying, Black Butler is one of my all-time favourite animes! I really think it is such a well-written series.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme of the anime is that a young boy called Ciel makes a deal with a demon called Sebastian. After Ciel\u2019s parents died he was taken to be sold as a child slave and one day in captivity as he was being tortured, he cried out of desperation that he had given up on god and this is when he met Sebastian whom he now has a deal with to avenge his parents death.\\n\\n\r\nDriven by sheer anger, revenge, hatred and hurt Ciel agreed to make a contract with Sebastian but the stipulation of this contract is that Sebastian gets to devour Ciel\u2019s soul once it has been fulfilled. The theme of revenge and redemption are well put together and the story lines are very well crafted though it isn\u2019t filled with non-stop action.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Butler certainly has it\u2019s share of dark and supernatural battle scenes as well as witty, funny battle scenes, there is also quite a bit of dark humour out through the series, but it is really balanced out by its traditional anime comedy along with this it also has mystery, drama and romance which is carried out very well.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character is complex and the variety in personality is something I really enjoy, getting to know each character is a nice experience of watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne big thing I loved about this anime is that there are certain points that make you want to laugh, cry and get angry at Sebastian and Ciel for the things they do but one part of the anime that always stays the same are the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters Finny, Mey-Rin, Bard and Lizzy which are Ciel\u2019s servants, always keep the comedic side to it and they have their own stories to tell.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the story we see many parts of Ciel, his many roles include, being Queen Victoria\u2019s watchdog, running Britains underworld, avenging his parents death and with his \u201cOne hell of a butler\u201d at hand, they both battle everything from drug runners and serial killers to demon hounds, angels, ghosts and other demons.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I can point out that is somewhat off-putting is the fake British accents, but I understand that not everyone can put on a good accent and after the first few episodes or so I found it funnier rather than an annoyance.\\n\\n\r\nScene from Episode 16\\n\r\nScene from Episode 16\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it doesn\u2019t quite turn out as expected and I did like the ending, I have seen a lot of fans complain about how it ended but me personally I didn\u2019t think it was so bad, I rather enjoyed that Ciel didn\u2019t die and Sebastian ended up being his butler for the rest of eternity because he made a promise to Ciel that he would be his butler until the end. I won\u2019t say how but Ciel ended up sharing his body with someone else who made a deal and the deal was that Ciel will turn into a demon when he gets his own body back.\\n\\n\r\nSebastian tried to kill Ciel so that he could have his soul but by the time he tries to do this, he is too late and Ciel is already a demon so now, for the rest of eternity Sebastian is Ciel\u2019s butler.\\n\\n\r\nIt truly ends by Ciel and Sebastian leaving the house to the servants, they head to a field and it is then explained what happened and why Ciel is still alive and why Sebastian is still with him.\\n\\n\r\nRating \u2013 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nOverall I personally found Black butler to be a fantastic anime, I really enjoyed it and it will always be up there with my favourites. The balance between dark and supernatural with traditional anime comedy really caught my attention and the storylines had me hooked! I would recommend this anime 100%.\\n\\n\r\nI know that Kuroshitsuji (Black Butler): Book of Circus is a the new season of the anime, going back to the storyline that is in the manga so it is not considered a continuation of the previous seasons as it goes back to Noah\u2019s arc Circus, but I would personally like to see another season which is a continuation of demon Ciel continuing with seeking revenge and possibly achieving this goal he has set out for himself as it would be interesting to see how Ciel\u2019s personality has changed, what strengths he has now and just how differently he would carry out his tasks.\\n\\n\r\nI guess that they want to stick to the manga storyline now so I do have high hopes for anything else they decide to release after Book of Circus! I\u2019m excited to see what they have in store for Black Butler.\\n\\n\r\n* I DID NOT watch the extra\u2019s that have been released for Black Butler I just watched the main series so I\u2019m unsure if they have done some spin off episodes where they have continued with demon Ciel\u2019s story, as I prefer to wait until a series is completely finished before I watch the extras. I will definitely check them out and if there is a continuation, I will edit this post and put my thoughts on it *\\n\\n\r\nIf your opinion of this differs from mine, or you would just like to add anything then please feel free to let me know.",

            "content": "\"I'm afraid when something is truly lost, one can never get it back again.\" A very mature thing for a 13-year-old earl to say. Today I'll be reviewing Kuroshitsuji also known as Black Butler.  I will break down everything in my review based on the divisions provided by MAL.\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nThe story has aroused mixed feelings in me. I would say that the episodes were linked well to produce a continuous story, but throughout the whole series, it has been peppered with canon that was not quite relevant. But, in retrospect, these canons have served their purpose to develop the characters. Elizabeth did not, however,developed much of a character in the anime as shown in the manga.  The anime only followed the manga until the 15th episode and broke off after that to follow its own separate route. The originality of the story after the 15th episode was amazing and has managed to surprise me at a number of times.  The story grew more intense as it neared its end, drawing out the deeper, darker themes that have been concealed by lighter moods earlier on in the anime. The latter was done quite well as it manages to have viewers forget that the actual theme of the anime was darker than expected and leave them to crash land when the deceptive veil is lifted. The ending was quite satisfying and left open. How it all ended was simple and undramatic, which gave off a gloomy atmosphere, but with a sense of relief and letting go in it. \\n\r\nOverall, I think the story was good.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nProduced in 2009, the art style of the anime may seem a little old schooled, with less shading, beautiful lighting and lacking in depth. But it seems to fit the anime, seeing that it was set in the Victorian era, technology was barely existing yet. This might not be of relevance to the anime, but I think it's a legit point. The art style also portrays the dreary atmosphere of England, so it's quite fitting. The art style of the characters looks rough compared to recent anime, but it's not a flaw that has bothered me much. Plus, it has improved in all its more recent adaptations.\\n\\n\r\nSounds (6/10)\\n\r\nSounds play a very big part in making or breaking an anime. The sounds in Kuroshitsuji are not as impressive and memorable as other anime such as K-Project but it has managed to bring out the essence of the anime. Korushitsuji has a mix of despondent sound tracks and happy-go-lucky ones that fit the moods, but none will stay with you long after you watch the anime. \"Si deus me relinquit\" was the only one that stuck to my mind. The opening and ending though are a different story.  The opening remained the same throughout the whole series, but has never bored me at the slightest. Ending #1 was cheerful and quirky with a \"cinematic strip\"of chibi Phantomhive household characters and has never failed to amuse and entertain. Ending #2, however, took on a darker twist, reflecting on the darkness of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10)\\n\r\nThere is an abundance of characters in this anime, with different levels of development. There were characters who were generic and those who had unique personality. Some only had the purpose of lightening the atmosphere the way I see it. Most of the characters developed well in the anime, though some seem to have remained stagnant throughout. The reaction of the characters in certain situations were exaggerated, but it is partially comedy, so no faults there. The expressions were done right, portraying the characters' emotions well. The antagonist in the anime had motivations, but seem to be lacking in background. Why is the villain set on committing his heinous acts? We know why, but where is he coming from? What happened in the past that motivated him to do so? It can be said differently with the protagonist, Ciel Phantomhive. By asking the questions above, we know that he has background and motivation. I don't have a particular dislike for any characters, but I would forever remember Ciel Phantomhive. Though only in his (early) teen years, the protagonist has already lost much, forcing him to grow up and face the real world at a far too early age. The fact that he hasn't keeled over and has taken matters in his own hands led me to respect and look up to him. Although he has the help of a near invincible demon butler, he has remained strong and persistent. Those are qualities I aspire to have in my life. So, there is no surprise that I would remember him. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10) \\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment, I basically had a great time watching this anime. The ability of the staff to create a light atmosphere that disguised the dark theme of this anime is amazing. I enjoyed the comedic moments and felt sadness when the plot took a darker turn. The comedy in the anime helped intensify the the feelings I felt when the series took on a serious vibe. I think this is a good anime; an anime that can drag you down so deep and lets you sympathize with the characters, but still give you some good laughs. Some will enjoy it, but others might not, because it left the manga entirely after the 15th episode. I would definitely rewatch it. It adds to my enjoyment and allows me to learn something new about the characters that I have missed. Kuroshitsuji has made it to my favourite anime list next to Attack on Titan.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I highly enjoyed the anime and would recommand it to any anime lover or my friends. I think it's something that I can talk about passionately and it allows my mind to think about the dark themes explored in this anime. If you are interested in history, Black Butler offers tidbits of Victorian England history that will prompt the curious mind to do a little research. Kuroshitsuji is one of the 2 anime that has managed to make me cry and I believe that speaks a lot by itself. \\n\r\nThat's all I have for today. Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "Despite the first impression you may have (Specially Men);  Kuroshitsuji definitely is a very good anime, why? It has a complex and well elaborated plot, a great art, a very good character development and is very very entertaining.\r\nWell... Where Should I Begin... The first time i heard of this anime, i said: \"It's sounds like it's a good story\" then i saw a picture and it was like: \"What Kind Of Yaoi Is this? Definitely not my type of anime\", The time passed and a friend of mine told me \"Have you seen Kuroshitsuji, i'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's not what you think\".And i give it a chance, and you know what: It's a Great Anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9\\n\r\nWell you have already read the synopsis, A death then a deal with a demon then revenge... Sounds great, now the point is: The plot is large enough to have 24 episodes? Of course, it is well developed, no repetitive and it has no fillers. Despite it's a dark story it has very funny moments, just as the serious and mysterious situations, and they are completely balanced and don't interfere between them. And if you like English Culture, definitely you'll love this.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\r\nThe drawings are great in every aspect, good use of the light, well animated, very detailed, but i've never liked chibi-stuff in a \"serious\" anime. Besides that, all great.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9\\n\r\nThe music is awesome, it fits perfectly with the plot and the scenes. The Intro is a memorable one, the first outro goes well with the begining of the story (funny and relaxed) the second is great for the ending of the story (Very melancholic).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9\\n\r\nOf course the main characters have been designed very well in every aspect, and are developed constantly and fine through the whole animation. But the secondary characters are not left behind, every one (or the great part of them) is well developed, so if you like psycological thrillers, you'll be very interested in this one.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9\\n\r\nThe story is good, the music, the art and everything else is good. So, It makes it a good/great anime, but now, Is it Enjoyable? YES, If you like thrillers, history, ocultism, Mystery, tragedy and comedy... YOU'LL LOVE THIS!",

The manga has a fantastic story line that keeps you on edge and the detail and quality of the art is something to be envied. \r\nHowever, in comparison to the manga, to be quite frank, the anime is lacking. For some reason, the company decided to go on a completely different track than the manga, so about 90% of the anime isn't even canon. What a horrible mistake that was. For first time viewers who know nothing of the Kuroshitsuji world, the story line is confusing at best, and you receive anexplanation after half of the anime is already over, and even then things are unclear. Honestly the addition of extra characters and story plot annoyed me, and I found it irrelevant and just plain stupid. The ending is also extremely unsatisfying and doesn't even really make any sense in hind sight...\\n\\n\r\nThat aside, Yana Toboso worked on this anime as well, and if you've seen and/or read the manga you'll notice her additions right away. The art is high quality and detailed, and all of Ciel's outfits are different! T\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a good balance of action and humor, and you'll instantly fall in love with multiple characters as you learn more about them. \\n\\n\r\nI gave this anime an overall 9 despite the non canon plot. Although, perhaps I'm a bit biased after reading the manga...\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I loved this anime, mainly because it really didn't stick to one individual plot throughout the whole series. It has little plots in between as well. I also love how the actual story takes place in London, and the people there with the clothes and everything actually looked like it took place in the 1800's. Also, I love the fact that Sebastian is really sincere to his master, and never breaks the contract. I love how they added actualevents that happen in history as well. For example, the fair would always happen when the Thames river would turn to ice.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10!\\n\\n\r\nI REALLY loved the art in this anime. The clothing that Ciel, Lady Elizabeth, and the background people wear actually look really decent to the fashion wear in the 1800's. I love how the creators used the characters as mannequins to show off the fashion wear of that time. I also mainly loved this anime based on the clothing and art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlright, so I really don't judge an anime based on sound, but since I want to get a full review of this series, I'll judge it. I mean, it was pretty decent and the intros and endings were okay as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked how the characters actually kind of develop in this series. I personally really find it pleasant that we got to look at Ciel's past, and how Sebastian became his Butler. I also find it funny that Lady Elizabeth is Ciel's Fianc\u00e9e. I mean, she's so positive and cheery, while he's really dark and evil. What a great combination! xP  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:9/10 <3\\n\\n\r\nI would really recommend this anime to people who like demons and a horror-ish (not really) type of anime.

            "content": "STORY: The anime takes place during the Victorian-era in England. The plot primarily focuses on the relationship between Ciel Phantomhive and his butler Sebastian. Even though it is episodic, there are some in-depth storylines that the anime does get into (especially when it involves the past of the Phantomhive family). There is a lot of action, history, mystery and comedy!\r\nCHARACTERS:\r\nCiel Phantomhive: He's very mature for a 13-year old! He has a cold soul and always serious and out for vengeance! Ciel is the owner of his family's company and is being taken care of by his butler/guardian. He is still a child a heart becauseCiel loves to play games (primarily chess). Ciel is also seen wearing an eyepatch during the anime.\\n\r\nSebastian: He is a hell of a butler. Sebastian's loyalty does without question. He is very devoted to protect Ciel and will do anything under his command. Sebastian can also be seen as a mysterious figure... Since this man can do it all... who is he really? What is his main intentions?\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI've watched this anime DUBBED in English and the voice overs are pretty good. Personally, the characters play a big part behind the anime's success. It is great to see the storylines and pasts of Ciel and his family (along with some of the other characters too). Plus, the mystery and cliffhangers in the episodes contain the suspense that makes you want to watch more. Luckily, there are some comedic relief to balance the serious elements out. Even though there are a few flaws in the anime, I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys the mysteries of crime and history, and the comedic relief that lets us continue to laugh and enjoy the fun.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji is either a hit or miss anime for certain viewers. Most either find the show to be extremely enjoyable or pretentious and bad. But for me I thoroughly enjoyed the series.\r\nStory: 8\r\nI gave the story category  a rating of 8 because of how things piece in together. I did not give a 9 or 10 just because of the first few episodes. I even went back to watch the first few episodes after I had finished the show. The first few episodes are sort of choppy and vague and don't give much of a sense of meaning because of how vauge the plotis portrayed during these episodes. Later on the story pieces together very nicely but I suggest if you want to watch this series, don't solely base it off of the confusion of the first episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI gave the art category a rating of 8 because of how the animation is presented. To be frank, Kuroshitsuji has one of my favorite art styles i've seen in anime. The character design is usually very sleek and gives a certain flair to each character, making them their own. But he reason I didn't give a score of 9 or 10 was because of certain art in scenes that didn't flow as well as I would've personally liked. As well as the color not being as crisp. But I gave it an overall 8 because the art is presented in a unique way (reason why the action scenes are my favorite because of the crisp art style and attention to detailing).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI gave the sound category a rating of 8 because of how the sound appeals to the viewer. The soundtrack is quite stunning (all of the openings in the Kuroshitsuji series get even better as the go along) and has such a significant feel to all of the music pieces. But the vocals really depend. Depending on whether you listen to the sub or dub is your choice. I can't give a too high rating or too low of a rating just because of the sound because it depends on the choice by the viewer. But if you pick either dub or sub, the music is still very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nI gave the character category a rating of 9 because of how the characters are portrayed during the anime. First, let's talk about character design. The outward appearance for each character is unique and gives every character a sense of personality and purpose. It's not like looking at each character and seeing someone who isn't memorable. Nearly every character is memorable from appearance alone. And on to the character development. Every main character has a significant personality and story that is always seen as interesting. Whether the character is mysterious or has tons of flaws, each character is interesting in their own way. Some background characters may not be a favorite but a few main ones with their own individual personalities and way of thinking brings a real spark to the show. A good kind of show can give you characters you may come to hate. But an even better show can bring you characters you love to hate with the power of bringing such a significant personality to a character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI gave the enjoyment category a rating of 9 because of how the show appealed to me. I had a great time watching this show because of how everything was paced and spread out into a very dramatic and interesting show to watch. I enjoyed the characters and the plot and how everything had become established. It kept my attention 90% of the time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI gave the overall category a rating of 8 because of how the show was presented. Obviously I couldn't give the show a 9 or 10 because, even a good show has a few flaws and bumps in the road. But to be fair, it was extremely entertaining and has been one of my favorite shows i've seen. I've even re watched it more than once as well. It had a solid impact on me and really made me want to see more. If you watch it and enjoy it, I suggest finishing out the rest of the series as well. I highly suggest watching this anime, I don't think you'll regret it.",

            "content": "Hello.\r\nFirst of all, I have to say that Kuroshitsuji is one of my favourite animes. \r\nWhat doesn`t mean I will play all nice, but I had, in fact, a good time seeing it.\r\nStory (7)\r\nThe concept of this anime is amazing, the ideia by itself is a 10 stars coin. Victorian age, that is a rich time scenary, combined with a boy that had made a contrac with a demon. Well, in fact, this sounds cool because it is cool.\r\nThe big problem is that Kuroshitsuji is a bit \"an everything\" anime and the bordelines between the different styles are very, very sharpen up accentuating things thatend up being pretty odd (P!ATD reference XD... ok, sorry). \\n\r\nThe comedy spoils the serious momments, but it`s welcome sometimes. They just overdue a bit. \\n\r\nAnd... I feel like I`m going to be hated for this... I didn`t like the Yaoi tones in this anime AT ALL.\\n\r\nHere they came... the sticks and stones!\\n\r\nWell, let me explain. I`m not a fan of Yaoi, but I find it entertaining in some concepts, you see? But NOT in this anime, not the way it was used. There were many excuses for fans to shipp Sebastian with Ciel and... it shouldn`t be that way, Ciel is a little boy and Sebastian a demon that can`t feel love. But in some scenes I really could see the \"underline\" message of this possible pairing. It was a bit like Arashi no Yoru ni. The 2 characters are friends but we can imagine them other way with ease (but I did like it in that film, here I didn`t) \\n\r\nIt can be o.k and even really good for some, but I, personally, would had prefered that the fanservice would go down quite a bit and the potencial darkness of the anime would be above over the other genres, not comedy above it nor fanservice above it.\\n\r\nThe plot was a bit messy sometimes, maybe because they didn`t follow the manga exactly.\\n\r\nBut it IS a wonderful anime, with a very decent plot. We have many things, ladies and gentleman, in this anime, we have mistery, we have history, we have action and supernatural. And of course lots of fanservice that, even when it don`t make sense, can be entertaining.\\n\r\nP.s: They could also had explored that Victorian age a bit more. They did, but I wanted deeper. \\n\\n\r\nArt (10) \\n\r\nIt`s so beautiful, the backgrounds, the characters design, that awesome clothes... \\n\r\nI didn`t see much anime, so forgive me if I\u00b4m wrong, but I do think it was perfectly well designed this anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9,5) \\n\r\nThe opening and respective animation catched my attention immediatly. Cool music for an opening, I don`t use to like openings, what a surprise. \\n\r\nBut then I heard \"I`m alive\" and I was like \"Meh\" it`s a bit strange for an ending song on an anime like this but I got used to and it switted the comedy momments (but you must admit that when one of the anime episodes ends on a dark vibe sounds funny hearing \"I`m alive\" following). At least the chibis are so cute that I never skipped the ending. \\n\r\nAnd then came Lacrimosa, that perfect piece of music art that I have on my ipod to replay again and again, it`s so touching and it totally gave us goosebumps and we realize that the end of Ciel was close (or I though it was cause... [Angered spoiler]... season 2... that season 2 spoiled one of the best finals in anime world. It was the type of final that leaves our heart ankored with the feeling of sadness for Ciel but fulfilness that it in fact ended dark[End of spoiler]\\n\r\nAnyway... about the soundtrack... is very unique... and in a good way.\\n\r\nAnd the character`s voice was good, good voice actors were used in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8) \\n\\n\r\nI don`t know what to say about Ciel. The bratty personality of his is better than a sweet-hearted one, the cinrcunstances made him bitter, is compreensible.\\n\r\nIs that kind of character that we sometimes like his attitudes and sometimes we just want to choke him. But that`s good, it`s like a person, right? We hate even if we love.\\n\r\nAnd now Sebastian... \\n\r\nhum... \\n\r\nHe is my favourite character... in all the animes that I saw.\\n\r\nThere are people who hate him because he is to perfect but I he is perfect just in actions and such... his personality is completaly f***** up. He is evil, not prince charming /although the anime keeps it hide because it is not good for fangirls/\\n\r\nI would like him even if the demonic side of Sebastian would had been more explored (my mashoquist said hello here) but anyway. Sebastian is a cool character.\\n\r\nI also really liked: Madam Red, Undertaker, Fred Abberline\\n\r\nO.k: The others \\n\r\nI don`t like: Lizzie (on the anime she is particulary annoying), Grell (he is useless, it`s on the show just for the fanservice), Pluto (again, is useless and not so well explained) \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8) \\n\r\nNot much to say here. \\n\r\nI already said it all!\\n\\n\r\nTotal score: 8,5 \\n\r\n(9, but it`s a low 9) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "First I think it is worth to mention that the Anime is quite different from the manga. The Anime  is good but the manga is far better in my opinion. So I would recommend the manga over the anime just for the plot/story. After episode 15 or something like that the anime has its own plot , totally different from the manga. The same goes for Black Butler season 2. It never happened in the manga.\r\nOther than that the animation and details are great. I really like the art work the costumes and every detail that is related with that historical time.\r\nThe story isnot that great or surprising. So do not expected great plot twists. There isnt something really unexpected in the story line. Many would say that there are many filler episodes but I like them because the characters are so great that you just want to watch them not matter what they do :)\\n\r\nThe whole story is about a 12-year-old boy Ciel , whos parent were murdered and now he is seeking his revenge. To get his revenge he made a contract with a demon, Sebastian. All the story is about them but you never get bored seeing them. Sebastian is cool and sexy and hot and sweet and all this at the same time :)\\n\r\n I like the English dub as well as the japanese. Some people dont like the eng dub but it is in victorian era so it is normal that they speak in \" weird British english\" :D",

            "content": "This isn't an anime I expected to like. The title itself reeks of Hot Topic and bug-eyed fangirls. But I love it, and you MIGHT too. \r\nI'll start right off the bat with something a bunch of people dislike about \"Black Butler\": its inconsistent tone. In an instant, it will flit from dark, Latin-singing choirs and ominous dialogue to levity normally reserved for zany comedies. For me, the juxtaposition works, and it's a large part of what makes \"Black Butler\" so palatable. I find a world is more fleshed out and relatable if it doesn't take itself too seriously. Yes, Sebastian is a demon whoultimately wants to feast on Ciel's soul - but that's just how demons roll. It's FAR more engrossing to focus on the nuances of Sebastian and Ciel's simultaneous relationships as lord/master and prey/hunter, and how both relationships affect one another. Because the show chooses not to constantly dramatize the \"demonic\" elements, it can instead devote its attention to crafting a multi-dimensional world, characters, and relationships. We could spend hours on Ciel ruminating over his decision, but isn't it more fun to... not? We know that if he backed out (which he wouldn't, because he's fucking Ciel), the show would be over. It would be silly and boring to watch him debate his decision over and over set to dramatic music when we could be having fun solving mysteries and exploring the VERY unique world the show lets us sink our teeth into. Wouldn't you agree?\\n\\n\r\nI have yet to read the manga, so I can't comment on when and where the anime deviates. I enjoyed the ending the anime gave us, but I look forward to seeing the ending the manga chooses. I love that this show has boosted A-1 Pictures financially so much, because \"Book of Circus\" is FAB as is \"Book of Murder.\" And they're coming out with \"Book of the Atlantic\" in 2017 as well! Huzzah!",

I loved this anime so much because its really sad and heartwarming, its 1 in the morning and im still up re-watching this thing it was soo good. Ciel is the poorest kid i ever saw and i want to follow him everywhere. Being rich means nothing if you dont have love. This anime shows so much about life in thesaddest, funniest way possible. I love this anime, i so much love it. I am a die- heart D.Gray-Man fan but this....this anime is (dare i say) 100000x better. It made me cry, laugh, squel, everything. The music is great, the picture is great, if you wanna see it, see it on Veoh it has all the episodes but use the ones that say [Eng.Sub] cuz it has the best sound quality. Kuroshitsuji is amazing, out of 5 stars, it deserves 10. Truely amazing. Great actors. Its fantasy but not too much. (no talking unicorns yay!) its great. trust me, im writting a long review its that good. its going to be hard to top this one, im going to have to look for a long time to find an anime as good as this one, its going to take forever! Im going to re-watch this until i die, its really really really good. the only thing you need to be aware of while your watching this is that it doesnt take place in japan. Its in england (but they speak japanese 0.o) well, thanks for reading this if you even got this far!",

The colors aren't obnoxious, and very realistic to the real world.\r\nThis is both, dark adn serious, but also very humourous. It has hints of yaoi, but it is in the end humourous as well. I have not founda character to hate in this show, so that must mean they are all great, because I usually hate one character or another. The voice acting was also unique, each voice was distinict and not at all similiar. (Unless my ears are screwy xD)\\n\\n\r\nI got a real kick out of the anime, and I'd watch it again and again if it wasn't for the fact that I have a life, I would be. It's just, ever so fantastic.

            "content": "Story-9\r\nI gave this a 9 although I would give it a 9.5 if I could. I love the darkness of the genre, but I also enjoyed the intense action and mystery too.  The plot is a very unique one that follows the main character, Ciel, in his quest for vengeance. Of course, there are also arcs involving his job, which is solving mysteries for the queen. I really enjoyed both the arc plots and the main plot and the way that they wove in with each other. The only reason I gave story a 9 was because sometimes it was really hard to waitthrough an arc when I really just wanted the main plotline to keep on moving.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10\\n\\n\r\nThe artistic aesthetics of this anime are very dark- which totally fits the genre.  The characters are designed well, and I really thought the artwork was beautiful while at the same time not over or underdone.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 8\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the opening goes, I usually skip it (not because I don't like it, I just want to get to the episodes.) It's not particularly remarkable in my opinion, but it's certainly not bad.  The background music and sound effects are very well done, but once again, I don't think there was anything super fantastic about them other than that they perfectly fit the dark atmosphere of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are probably the number one thing about this anime.  Their personalities and their relationships are all very intriguing, but I was especially drawn in by the relationship between Sebastian and Ciel. It's very complex and very well done. There are times when the watcher simultaneously loves and hates the characters all at once and it's addictive. Not to mention the less focal characters, like a certain grim reaper with obsessive fantasies that provides great comedy, the household servants with hilarious problems and shadowy pasts, and the annoying yet somehow endearing fiance- they all captivate you and grab your attention.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10\\n\\n\r\nI must say I loved this anime, it's probably one of my favorites of all time.  It has plenty of action elements, but I also really enjoyed the mystery and subtleties it has.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 10\\n\\n\r\nA fabulous anime. If you like a darker genre with a lot of thrill, this is for you!\\n\\n",

The different genres were utterly blended together in perfect harmony. Unlike others who would leave the dish half-cooked, Kuroshitsuji will serve it preciselyas a perfect butler would. Although the story has a striking resemblance to Hellsing, they gave it their own finishing touches that actually have a different sensation.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is admirable but not quite distinctive from other anime but the way they created the characters definitely indubitably accommodated the era and the personalities of each characters. The eye marking is undeniably unoriginal and the pentagram on Sebastian\u2019s hand greatly resembles the ones in Hellsing but other than that, it is quite a catch, especially the butler whose face you cannot forget. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) \\n\\n\r\nThe music is discernibly pure perfection as your heart starts throbbing to the melody and quivers throughout your entire body. The sweet melodies are perfectly in sync with the Victorian era while the thrilling battle music gives your heart a double pounding. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe varieties and distinctiveness of the characters and the driving force it causes to the entire story itself. The hell of a phrase in this anime not only suits the character perfectly but it is also quite contagious and you would find yourself transforming into his very form. They also successfully pulled a barrier between the serious main characters from the rest who are quite the opposite. Although they are quite the serious type, they would find a way through your subconscious and make you laugh. The balance between serious and funny, childish and mature, good and evil are perfectly rolled up into this intriguing anime. \\n\\n\r\n*Overall, the anime is unique in a way at the same time unoriginal\u2026quite the irony. The final moments is quite the shocker but at the same time you would feel something missing but in the end, it has one of the most beautiful endings in any anime that I have seen. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend you to see Kuroshitsuji II. If you find this a dull or boring, the next season is a hundred times better because of the added psychological feel and seriousness.\\n\\n\\n",

The different supernatural creatures being butlers (Shinigami, Angels, Puppets and Demons) was entertaining.\r\nThe only reason it missed out on a 10/10 was the fact that you really didn't learn anything about Ciel's parents (the reason why he was getting revenge) until the very end.  You hear a little bit about them from Madam Redat the start but that is about it until the last few episodes.",

The sound quality was perfect and I couldn't notice anything bad about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe Characters were very well thought out! I loved all their traits! I especialy loved Sebastians personality. Also, I liked how Ciel was always so demanding. He be rude at times, but he is still a great character. The servants of the Phantomhive estate (Mey-Rin, Bardo, Finni) were very humorous characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is a very enjoyable anime. At first, I was iffy about it, but it got better and it became my favorite anime. I love how it was made and I prefer to origanal Japanese version. Not the english but the anime was super enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI rate this anime a 1,000,000 out of 10 because it was a cliff hanger, I couldn't stop watching it, well thought out, great art, sound and charcters, and It had the best story I had ever seen and It changed my life.",

It was also not predictable which I loved because I hate being able to guess what happens. I have noting but praise for Kuroshitsuji.",

            "content": "This must be added in your\"plan-to-watch\" list because this is one of a hell anime! It is really awesome! I really got addicted to it that I even added it on my Favorites and tried to write a review once again (cause i typed a review like 30 mins ago but my brother closed the window of my almost-finished review >:( ) cause i really love this anime! (especially SEBBY! :)\r\nART\r\nIt was great! The setting really looked like England. The clothes of the people there really copied the clothes during the 1800s. The pale colors that were used added the Victorian-feels. I love how theart is  neat though most of the clothes are full of ribbons and ruffles. It's quite detailed too. And you'll love the fight scenes since the animations were really good!\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nTerrific. The voice actors really fit with their roles. Sebastian Michaelis' voice actor Ono Daisuke (if you know him, he's popular for voicing a lot of main anime characters) is really good! His voice was majestic, soothing, calm and elegant and will make you really feel  that he is a butler! So as to Ciel's voice actress, (yeah actress, though Ciel's really a boy in the story) though Ciel's a boy, she made Ciel's ignorant, rude and dominant character possible! You'll feel that Ciel really is a king that you must honour and listen to! Gah! The characters and their voices are all amazing! I cant explain them all!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\\n\r\nPerfect and unique, just like black butler Sebastian! Most of the characters' capabilities and characteristics are unpredictable and its what makes it amazing and outstanding!\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed watching this anime! (I know it's very obvious) You have to watch this, I swear! It's one of those animes that are hard to forget! After I finished this season, I really felt sad and i dont know if I should be. Also, after watching this, I felt like I want more. I researched a lot of stuff about the anime itself, downloaded the character songs, started reading the manga, thought of watching the second season (though I read a lot of review of the Kuroshitsuji 2 that it was completely different from the manga so im having doubts if I should watch it) even though the main characters were replaced (i love ciel and sebastian so much that i want to marry both of them!) by another butler and a boy seeking for revenge too, just their personalities are completely different from the first ones. Plus, after watching this first season, like I said I wanted more, so I searched a lot and found out that there is a musical play of this anime! I was so thrilled and spent my 4 hours and half watching the 2 musicals and eventually, on May 2013, a third Kuroshitsuji musical will be performed and I just cant wait! You must watch it too! The characters were portrayed and copied well, every details in their costumes and characters! (the real life Ciel in the first musical play look so much like him! and the sebastian in the two Kuroshitsuji musicals is very hot and copied anime sebastian's soothing voice and actions well! though the fight scenes are not perfect, it's really fun to watch! real life animes! like cosplayers that are acting, plus singing!!! watch it guys!)\\n\\n\r\nSo anyway, obviously, if you are asking about my enjoyment, do you think I enjoyed this anime?\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nOUTSTANDING. UNIQUE. COOL. MYSTICAL. FULL OF KNOWLEDGE.\\n\r\nA MUST-WATCH FOR EVERYONE. If you ever get bored with its 5 or 8 episodes, ignore that feeling! Watch more and try to finish its 24 episodes. When you reach the middle part of the anime episodes, you'll feel the climax and get interested more and more! :)\\n\\n\\n\r\nOkay! So Ive done my part! I hope this helps you (I think I reviewed a lot of my feelings in this anime though.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nOther than this, you might also want to watch:\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji II\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji Specials\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji Recap\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji Musical 1\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji Musical 2: The Most Beautiful Death in  The World",

Well, I really love Kuroshitsuji, it's the best anime. I got into this anime because I was always attracted to Victorian- era, and wished that it's still the same as now...but that is before, Victorian- era is scary, and no one wants to go back there and get operated without any anesthesia. So, going back to the show, other than being obsessed with Victorian- era, I also find things involving a 12-14 protagonist shows fascinating, why? because I think children (sorryCiel), being a protagonist will test just how strong they are, but at the same time, shows faults, I mean, hey, children are children. \\n\\n\r\nSo, apparently, this anime is currently my obsession.

If you are a big fan of crime, suspense, humorous, with a little bit of horror than this is the anime for you.  The only problem I have with the show is that their are some questions that are still not answer, or the answers take to longto get answer, plus the show doesn't get good until around the 4th episode, but all the episodes after 4 keep getting better and better.",

            "content": "Criteria \r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story of Black Butler is quite intricate yet simple at the same time. This is because it is mainly set up into 2-4 episode arcs each with their own story yet also able to connect to the next arc and the previous arc. To put simple though the story basically revolves around a boy named Ciel Phantomhive who lost his parents at a young age and made a contract with the devil to exact revenge on those who killed them. Each arc has a little bit to do with the main story of finding the one who killed his parents even thougheach arc still has its own story.\\n\\n\r\nEnding: 4\\n\r\nEven though I liked the story of Black Butler I found the ending absolutely atrocious, it just build up so much hype and emotion and then just ends.  There is really no way to explain it without ruining it so I won\u2019t explain it. Just understand the only thing we wanted to see and thought we would see, we don\u2019t see. They show us the event proceeding it but then when it comes to the main event it just ends, and that is why I gave it such a low rating.\\n\\n\r\nSolid Plot: 8\\n\r\nI really liked how they were able to keep a solid and consistent plot both of the main story and each individual arc.\\n\\n\r\nMoral: 8\\n\r\nBlack Butler touched on a lot of dark and realistic themes which is why I can\u2019t understand why it was rated PG 13. However one of the more \u2018childish\u2019 themes even though it was illustrated in such a dark manner, is that no matter who you are, where you are or where you\u2019re from we are all human and we all shed the same color blood\\n\\n\r\nSense: 5\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say this anime made no sense yet it also didn\u2019t make perfect sense. For starters there are just too many questions left unanswered towards the end of the Anime. Such as (SPOILERS?) why don\u2019t they take the collar off of the demon dog and why is the queen so young; along with many others. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\r\nThe music of Black Butler was amazing, the openings as well as the ending have go to be up there with my top 5. Also the music was very complimentary to the mood of the scene, the pitch and tone would rise and fall depending on the pace of the scene which was very nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nAbsolutely loved the art of Black Butler, no two characters looked the same and also the art work in general was done very well\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThe highest point for Black Butler seeing as each main character was given a full background and we also got to witness their background. Character progression was also very nice seeing as they don\u2019t all stay the same from episode 1 up to episode 24. Characters gain maturity, respect and love for one another.\\n\\n\r\nBoredom/Captivation Scale: 8\\n\r\nI quite enjoyed this anime except for the ending which really let it down, if it had a better ending then I would have loved it even more.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Score: 7\\n\r\nA 7 only due to the fact that the ending ruined it for me, and the way I see it the ending of an anime takes up about 70% of the score as it affects everything with rating the main criteria. However with that said would I recommend this anime? A hard question because even though it was generally good I honestly said to myself \u201cwhat a waste of time\u201d after watching the ending. So yes and no; if you've got nothing better to do with your day and just want an Anime to watch that will take up time then watch this, however if you\u2019re looking for an Anime for a smashing start and banging ending then I don\u2019t recommend this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGenres\\n\r\nComedy: 7\\n\r\nThe funny scenes where generally funny and sometime had me \u2018rolling over laughing\u2019 \\n\\n\r\nAction: 8\\n\r\nAction scenes where packed with a lot of fighting and a lot of Hollywood style kills. (he kills people with silver ware)\\n\\n\r\nSupernatural: 7\\n\r\nThe average type of supernatural yet with its own twist. We have Angels, Demons, Ghost, Mystery killers and even a demon dog.\\n",

At the time i had never watched anime and was pretty much completely Sherlock obsessed, this anime basically changed everything for me. \r\nThe story is very similar to that of Sherlock Holmes in the beginning but as the characters develop and the story line unfolds it grips your attention so much so that it's hard to stop watching. \r\nThe main characters Ciel and Sebastian and are easy to fall in love with even though they both have complex backgrounds, there is a strong theme of mystery through outthis anime and i suppose that's one of the reasons its so gripping. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime will always be my favourite due to the perfect graphics, thrilling story line and supernatural nature, I recommend this to absolutely anyone. \\n\\n\r\nKeeping this in mind, i find this anime to be one that can have you in tears one moment and giggling the next, it brings out a lot of emotions and that's exactly what caught my attention. During the first few episodes i was unsure about whether to carry on watching, number one because it was the middle of the night and it was pretty creepy but also because i had never watched something quite like it. Slowly as the story unfolded though i found myself thrown into the world of Kuroshitsuji and i regret nothing.",

            "content": "Set in England during the Victorian Era we meet a 12 year old Earl named Ciel Phantomhive and his demon butler named Sebastion that he made a contract with until Ciel's goal has been acclomplished.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nI really enjoyed the story of Ciel's parents getting killed and how he made the contract with Sebastion and he would give Sebastion his soul once he found out who killed his parents.\r\nAnimation: 10/10\r\nI really liked the animation. I liked how dark and gothic the animation could be and it gave off a goth vibe. The victorian-era background was also done really nicely.\r\nSound: 8/10\r\nThe sound is very good. I lovedthe opening song of this show and enjoyed the 2nd ending of ths show but i did not understand the 1st ending of the song. It did not fit well with the show and was way to preppy in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharechters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed pretty much all the charechters in the show, my favorite being Sebastion.  The one i could not stand though was Ciel's cousion/fiancee Lizzy, she annoyed me so much and she always whined and acted like a brat when she didn't get her way. Luckily she was barley on the show.\\n\\n\r\nOveral:8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall i enjoyed the show very much and it's my favorite anime.",

As the story progressed and more dark secrets were revealed the action kicked up and the show was overtaken by amazing fight scenes. I give this anime the highest possible rating and recommend it to all.",
