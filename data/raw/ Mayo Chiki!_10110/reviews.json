They give what they should give, but they rarely give me what I want, and maybe I'm expecting too much.\r\nIt's a perfectly enjoyable rom com. Everything is as it should be. The general characters archetypes, the twist within the premise, likeable enough characters, and enough humor to get by.\r\nYet, the \"romance\" part seems... lacking. This is more an issue with the genre as a whole then Mayo Chiki. Genuine romantic resolution always seems out of grasp.The characters that need to get together never do get together, and when the series is over, you begin to wonder what the point of it all was.",

It is better if you.....\r\nOh wait a minute, this isn't the Cook's Review! My bad folks... It's just that mayonnaise is my most favorite condiment and it goes well with any food. Heck I'm watching this anime while eating mayo out of a jar!\r\n(For those who does not know what Mayo is, I can assure you, it's not an musical instrument.)\r\nAnyways, onward with the review!\r\nMayo Chiki! is a abbreviation of MayoeruShitsuji to Chikin na Ore to. Mayo Chiki (the anime) is not to be confused with Mayo Chiki (the food) Only God knows who's idiotic enough to mix them both up.. Heh.. heh...\\n\r\nTranslation: The Wavering Butler and Myself the Chicken\\n\\n\r\nProduced by TBS and Feel, yes you heard me right... \"Feel\" people responsible for making popular fan service titles such as \"Kiss X Sis\" and \"Yosuga no Sora\" so is it wrong to presume equivalent amount of needless fan-service in this anime? BOING!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a youthful boy named SakamaCHI KINjiro (see what I did there?) who discovered Subaru Konoe, a fellow classmate, secret of being a TRAP! Subaru must presume the role of a male because guys are just so awesome that every girl wants to be guys... Ehmm.. I mean it's a tradition of her family for every male family member to be the butler to the [Insert rich generic family who probably gained their wealth by stepping on us poor peasants] What will happen to our hero? Now of course if you know the genre an anime is the \"comedy and romance combo\" then there's a good chance our hero will get ABUSED physically and mentally by practically everyone. And I mean EVERYONE. Yes, even by his mom. Poor lad..\\n\\n\r\nAs the Chief Animation Director, Kawamura Kousuke was entasked with character design, which he executed exceptionally well. Though I never did read the light novel, I'm assuming fans had no qualms about his depiction of what the author of the light novel was trying to portray. \\n\\n\r\nI was expecting this anime to be nonsensical and hilarious, revolving around pervertic shenanigans, so I was assuming the music to be upbeat and mischievousness just like the cast. Well, you can't go wrong with Kitamura Eri right? The OP is a perfect example how the author is trying to tell is that unlike the usual Romcom genre, the crossdressing Subaru is the main player, not the Chicken, Kinjiro. It shows how everyone loves Subaru, and doesn't give a damn about Kinjiro. I feel your pain Kinjiro... Your mum hates you, now everyone else ignores you. We are so alike.. (yes, I too am in love with a cross dresser)\\n\r\nKudos to the selection of cast for seiyuus as well. They are able to use their voice to portray the character's personality quite well.\\n\\n\r\nSo lets move on to characters...\\n\\n\r\n[Sakamachi, Kinjirou]\\n\r\nThe target of everyone's abuse. Currently living with his sister and his mum. His dad passed away when he was a young boy. Did I mention that his mum is a professional wrestler?\\n\r\nSo I think this is how it went down.\\n\r\nKinjirou's Dad: Honey, make me a sandwich!\\n\r\nKinjirou's Mum: ...........\\n\r\n[THE NEXT DAY KINJIROU'S DAD IS HOSPITALIZED]\\n\\n\r\nI guess you could say he got.... \\n\r\n*puts on sunglasses*\\n\r\nA Knuckle Sandwich...\\n\r\nYEEEEAAAAAAH!!! [Cue CSI Miami OP song]\\n\\n\r\nEhmm... Ok enough with the lame jokes...\\n\r\nMy condolences to Kinjiro, his dad was a good man, just with the wrong women. Anyways, due to his father escaping his miserable fate, Kinjiro gets abused by his mother and sister instead. (Now kiddos this is an anime, if you know a child being abused by his parents in real life, please tell social service. Thank you) This causes him to develop Gynophobia (fear of women) and his body reacts to this phobia by secreting blood from his nose. Which is weird because, I don't know, don't normally main male lead in RomCom gets punched by a girl after his nose starts bleeding? So doesn't these nosebleeds makes it worse? So in a nutshell, he doesn't want to be touched by girls. So is it a sign for him to turn to the gay side?\\n\r\nKinjiro is reliable, when time comes, and he is depended heavily on Subaru. Which is good because he is the one responsible most of the time for bringing the \"dere\" side out of her.\\n\\n\r\n[Konoe Subaru]\\n\r\nThe generic trap in every anime who makes fun of flat chested girls. Though she looks nothing like a flat chest girl! This is blasphemy! Now even girls with B cup sizes can look like a guy in 5 easy steps? She is also the main source of Yaoi and Yuri jokes in the anime. (How is that even possible?) As the butler to the Suzutsuki family, she serves the current heir Kanade Suzutsuki. She has the best of both worlds. Wanted both by males and females. She is an interesting character to me. She has her own harem (a tsundere with a harem? Even more blasphemy!), however her harem consists of the same gender. So do I label it as a harem or as a reverse harem? Plus, if she likes Kinjiro and Kinjiro himself gets a harem, so wouldn't that be a harem within a harem?\\n\r\nHAREMCEPTION!\\n\\n\r\n[Kanade Suzutsuki]\\n\r\nBishojo and a sadist. Deadly combo, but a dream come true to every masochists. She plays as the childhood friend in Subaru's harem... Or reverse harem.. Or whatever, I don't know anymore. She acts as the mediator between Kinjiro and Subaru's relationship, though she preferably likes torturing them more. However, she honestly do want to help cure Kinjiro of his phobia (probably by draining all his blood so he can't get nosebleeds anymore)\\n\\n\r\n[Other Cast]\\n\r\n-Includes Kinjiro's sister who wants to be a wrestler as well. Also part of Subaru's harem.\\n\r\n-Other maid belonging to the Suzutsuki family. Also part of Subaru's harem.\\n\r\n-Some parody of the KKK cult who loves Subaru, also part of.... Ok, this is getting repetitive. I'll just say this once, every other cast is in Subaru's Harem. Capiche?\\n\r\n-The Yaoi group who supports Subaru-Kinjiro relationship. \\n\\n\r\nThough having an interesting title with a slightly promising premise, Mayo Chiki! does lack a source of innovation, story and character wise perhaps. I mean even the 4 main cast have the same initials, K.S. (That does not come from abbreviation Kill steal, mind you)\\n\r\nIt needs a greater impact on the audiences so that they'll be able to differentiate this anime from every other RomCom there is. (I'm sorry but there are already a couple of cross dressing RomCom in the anime world and I'm sure this is not the end of it) Putting lots of fan-service may pique my interest for a moment, though it will last as long as my attention span (which is actually really short) Though, I must admit even if the story is not so original, the humor is entertaining. It doesn't take much for me to chuckle to even generic yaoi or yuri jokes. Perhaps more development in the future would lead to a more memorable cast.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion, in recent months, introduction of crossdressing characters have been rapidly increasing, so I'm not sure if that's a new fetish or something you people have? Maybe it's a bisexual thing? But I don't think that's a good idea since you're opening yourself up to be rejected by both sexes? Anyways, Mayo Chiki! is a decent RomCom to kill time with. Hilarity plus it doesn't dwell too deep in logic but it gets your mind blown with question once in a while like,\"IF SHE IS AFRAID OF KNIVES, HOW IS SHE GOING TO STAY IN THE KITCHEN?\" or something like that. \\n\r\nYou will laugh, you will cry, you will do plenty of face palm, but most importantly, you will remember that no matter how tempting being the opposite sex must feel like, be grateful of how you were intended to be created...... And be thankful that you're not allergic to the opposite sex, cause that's just SUCKS dude.... If you know what I mean ;)\\n\\n\r\nHaremu Kingu,\\n\r\nSinging Off!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It started out very well and interesting; and the more episodes I watched, the more I fell in love with the anime.\r\nEach episode kept me more and more interested in the anime. And even with my second run-through of rewatching the whole anime, I felt the same joy... there was a happiness that I felt more and more as I watched and enjoyed the series.\r\nThere is romance, ecchi (not ridiculous ecchi), comedy, & cross-dressing, and it's very entertaining. To me, I felt this anime was much of a generic romcom (romance/comedy)... where it doesn't teach muchor give meaningful insights on symbolism to life and such. But that it's entertainment purposes, of which it does very well in providing that!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is about romance between main character Jirou (male) and slightly less main character Subaru (female). Its interesting plot is set to expand upon the episodes of bonding between these two who started off on the wrong foot. There are also a few important supporting characters who are very likable; they assist in moving the story forward and supporting the main character. Having these side characters each play their unique roles in the story along with their interactions with the main protagonist really makes this anime a joy and laugh to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song also really grew on me and if you watch it, it'll grow on you too. The pacing itself is very well done throughout the series; giving me such a high incentive to continue watching, I marathoned the whole 12 episodes and skipped my sleep that night  >->  However, many people including myself felt that there was something missing from/after the conclusion.\\n\r\nHave you ever watched those anime's where it is good, but there is something that you just want from it, something more...  even though you've already finished all the episodes? That's how this anime is. However, it is very enjoyable nonetheless. I know that the anime may leave fans wanting more, but accepting its conclusion appreciates the enjoyment that came from the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI would say that satisfaction varies upon viewers around: 7.75 to 8.75 out of 10.",

They make agreement to keep secret. They get close. Some other random girls show up. Lots of blushing and more blushing and nosebleeds.

The story also seems to be interesting, but this alsocomes from a personal preference that I like to stories about a female that crossdresses as a male. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is nice, I don't usually like guys with glasses but the art in this anime is capable of making the protagonist good looking to me. I also like how when Subaru is dressed as a boy the effect of actually making her look and sound like a male can be achieved, unlike in Ouran High School Host Club where Haruhi still retains some femininity, which fits the story well.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Kinjirou, seems to be average looking but his fear of women, and his body's \"special\" ability, as well as his family make him seem above average. His little sister has an interesting personality and reminds me a bit of Minori Kushieda from Toradora! Subaru seems to be fully into the part of a male and a butler but also has a feminine side which is to be expected.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd say this anime is worth watching. It probably won't make it into your favorites but it's not bad by any means.",

Visually Mayo Chiki is well animated and the character designs are well done, even though they all seem a little too familiar. There is nothing new which makes this series stand out from other anime of the same genre so I don't expect anyone to watch this series and regard it at one of their favourite animes of the year, but it does make for a good gap fillerin between some of the better releases planned for this summer. This is an easy to watch anime, there is nothing complicated or mind blowing about the story or the visuals but in the end it's still a fun series to pass the time while waiting for something better to come along. \\n\\n\r\nReview by Charles Shepherd\\n\r\nwww.electricbloomwebzine.blogspot.com",

            "content": "There are still a couple of episodes to go, now that all main characters have been featured it is time to make my review, and my ratings are:\r\n  Story- fair 6.\r\nThe plot of the story is very simple and it is for the El Pollo ( Spanish for \"Chicken\" and I'm referring to Sakamachi Kinjirou) to protect the cross dressing chiquita's ( Konoe Subaru the female lead) secret after he accidentally discovered it, which, by the way nearly ended his life, the arc of the story is not something were the chiquita (Konoe) moves into the El Pollo's (Jirou) life to mess things up.Actually, it is more like an accidental romance waiting to happen, but there are some challenges along the way for the 2, and it always involves the chiquita's mistress, Kanade who too bored with everyday life and finds fun in putting the 2 in a lot of awkward situations.\\n\\n\r\nArt- mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself can be compared to other animes like \"Infinite Stratos,\" \"Working,\" and \"Toradora.\"\\n\\n\r\nSound - good 7.\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is that i like both the opening and ending themes, I also admire Konoe's seiyu Yuka Iguchi, if I'm not mistaken she once did a voice of some rich man's daughter in \"Mayoi Neko Overrun\" as Chise Umemori, I really can't believe that she can do voices of someone who's childish and someone who's like a MILF. Frankly, Konoe's voice actually sounds like a MILF than a dude.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nI said decent, co'z their are some info about the characters which were somewhat mismentioned so some added info about them should be appropriate, so let's start with the following:\\n\\n\r\nKonoe Subaru- Info states that she works for the Suzutsuki's estate as a butler?????? Ok,  that's a given, her immediate ward is the young and diabolical Mistress Kanade at first- before the El Pollo (Jirou) discovers her true gender, life for her is just the usual: serve the mistress(Kanade) with the utmost dedication which may probably include playing along with the latter's sexual advances ( she (Kanade) did mentioned that she has feelings for her)  , do good in school, and be careful that no one finds out your true gender. Upon meeting the El Pollo (Jirou) through unusual circumstances, life for her has somewhat change co'z she's now faced with the predicament of  balancing her dedication with her mistress (Kanade) and her feelings for the El Pollo(Jirou). In ep9, the chiquita (Konoe) has stated that she wants to be the El Pollo's best friend, however it may also suggest that she is just being careful because her mistress (Kanade) might hear it and plan a bigger scheme to have more fun. By the way in this anime, she's the one with the balls here, since it was her who does all the buttkicking not only towards the El Pollo (Jirou), but to other cast as well.   \\n\\n\r\nSakamachi Kinjirou - As stated, he's called \"Chicken\" not only because he's a wuss, but because went one is to combine the last 3 letters from his surname with the first 3 letters of his first name you get a misspelled word \"Chikin.\" Kanade would either call him \"Chikin\" but most of the time she will address him as \"Jirou,\" for Usami, she would call him \"Baka Chikin,\" most of the time that is, especially when she's pissed, in fact she is always pissed at the El Pollo (that's what I call him and again that's \"Chicken\" in Spanish). This poor El Pollo (Jirou) went through a lot in the hands of his sadistic wrestling superstar mom and his equally sadistic sister, which later on he developed a certain disease call \"Gynophobia\" that cause him to develop sever nose bleed when touched by a girl, ok so we all know that,duh. The thing about him, is that he's one gynophobic who can  still talk to girls- from a certain distance that is, be in a classroom with girls around provided by that his seatmate is Kurose Yamato his classmate way back from junior high, it is even suggested that they both used to share and exchange porn mags and it may also suggested that he also experiences sexual arousal's when viewing such lewd publications. Info states, that he's capable of fighting, but in one episode all I saw was (at least in this anime) is him  putting up alright, but ending up being punching bag as usual when he encounters the chiquita's father (Subaru Nagare) in disguise. Another thing about the El Pollo, is that he always falls victim not only with Kanade's  schemes but also with her sexual advances as well, it is not known whether or not the mistress (Kanade) has any feelings for him or was he just being teased for fun by the latter, but what is known is that all she did promise to help him cure her Gynophobia.........or at least that is what she always says. \\n\\n\r\nKanade Suzutsuki - well, she's rich, she's pampered, she's the school principal's only kid, she's spoiled and most of all, she's bored, the moment she found out that one of the student discovered her butler's secret she instantly hit upon an idea to have fun with the 2 parties involved. That is, to manipulate her butler's blind obedience and to make use of the poor El Pollo's stupidity coupled with his psychological disorder. It is suggested that she's bisexual, since info suggest that she has feeling both for the chiquita (Konoe) and for the El Pollo since she both  teases them, however, to whom she more into is yet to be known. As for the background of this character, I can't seem to understand  that for her to be a principal's daughter is an understatement because school principles don't have such luxurious privileges and the school where this character is in don't look like some high class institution where it is exclusive for the rich, in fact most of the characters who are attending that school seems to just be part of the middle class.\\n\\n\r\nUsami Masamune - also called \"Usamin\" by the El Pollo, well all know that she's a former member of some radical fan group called S4 or better known as \"Shooting Star Sabaru Sama,\"  of course no harem would be complete without a tsundere who's also competition for the El Pollo's affection. She's also one of those who kicks the El Pollo's ass, cute as she is, I'm still for Konoe to be the El Pollo's love interest.\\n\\n\r\nKureha Sakamachi - It is hard to say if whether or not if she has a brotherly complex for the El Pollo, what is known is that she always practices her wrestling move against her brother and she like tomatoes  a lot. And recently she has a crush on the chiquita (Konoe), but I wonder if she'll become lesbian when she finds out that that chiquita (Konoe) is a girl.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNakuru Narumi - For a ganguro who's a fan of BL (Boys Love.....EEEEEEWWWW) I don't see her flaunting her collection of BL manga, the only thing she's flaunting is her fetish for glasses, ok so she's the chairwoman of a group of BL fans called \u201cLet\u2019s warmly protect Sabaru Sama,\" but I don't see her being with her group, the only person she's with most of the time is with the El Pollo's sister Kureha and sometime she's seen with Usami. She probably the only character who get's drunk on carbonated drinks and can turn into a perverted lesbian or a bisexual.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment- good 7.\\n\\n\r\nWhat make this anime enjoyable is its comedy and romance genre,  this is one anime were the bellas (female cast) are on top and the hombres (male cast) are the underdogs. Also, this anime has quite an unusual harem genre in it, were it is shared both by the chiquita (Konoe) and by the El Pollo (Jirou), there are of course some ecchi in it but it is a bit subtle and safe enough to be view by a 13 year old with parental supervision. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - good 7.\\n\\n\r\nLike I've said, there are still a couple of episodes to go, however, I kinda have a feeling that the chiquita (Konoe) will probably come clean and the El Pollo will still be Gynophobic, but, here's the thing, it is possible that even though the chiquita (Konoe) has come clean, the remaining female class will turn lesbian and the El Pollo will be left in the sides, let's just say that there is part of the opening theme which serves as a give away, if it is, I guess we just have to wait and see.                 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fully Updated to Final Episode.\r\nGoing into Mayo Chiki! I thought I was gonna get a generic anime with some ecchi sprinkled on top. I regret that train of thought completely. Its not a generic anime with ecchi sprinkled on top, its an anime with AMAZINGLY placed ecchi and hilarity combined with a decent story and great characters! \r\nStory:\r\nThe story is heading in a way that Jirou and Subaru's friendship keeps growing with each passing episode, with events bringing them closer together. It also looks like Subaru and Kanade's friendship will be slowly restored to what it once was before an incident in their past. Italso keeps that comedic aspect with Kureha's love for Subaru and Kanade causing great misunderstandings that cause Jirou hell every episode. This never stopped even til the very end, with the final episode just being a cluster of misunderstandings and perversion. It went out with a bang!\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nIt's pleasing to the eyes, the colors are vivid, the characters are well designed, with a wide array of different character styles being used, from kiddy designs (Jiriou's tomboy sister) to mature cosplay (The catgirl cosplayer in episode one). \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI found the Opening and Ending themes to be quite appealing to listen to. They aren't amazing amazing, but they are still really nice and go really well with the anime and the opening and ending sequences respectively. With each passing episode I seem to love the music more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nJirou is that cool geek guy you get every once in a while. The man with Gynophobia due to... family problems. That... surprised me to say the least, and sadly for him he's been labeled as gay to to his gynopobia. That alone made me like his character since normally the guys are either accidental pervs or are no balled men that can't stand up to girls. Jirou is none of that, he likes his women! He just fears for his life due to his family! Totally waiting to see if he can get over his fear of girls in some way. By the looks of things, his gynophobia is going to stay for quite sometime at the rate things are going. Not that I mind, its hilarious to see.\\n\\n\r\nSubaru is the trap butler that never gets old. But, Subaru... is absurdly cute. Having to be such a serious butler for Kanade and then able to go into an extremely girl state amuses me to no end! Her affection of sheep is adorable as well! From the first episode I thought she might have no weaknesses, but gravely mistaken as in episode 3 a childhood fear is revealed, making her more likeable since she isn't \"invincible\". \\n\\n\r\nKanade seemed innocent at first, which I was like \"Sure ok, every anime needs the innocent Ojou-Sama\". I was naive, There is nothing innocent in that woman. At all. I won't spoil anything, go watch the first episode to understand why I say such things. I said this all before episode three. She does have her kind side of course, since she does care for Subaru and the others as shown this episode. But.. She's still pretty darn evil when she has nothing better to do!\\n\\n\r\n Kureha is that insanely strong tomboy you see once in a blue moon. She is insanely strong, having fought a bear on equal footing, only breaking an arm in the process. She also has one hell of a variety of wrestling moves. I was in love!\\n\\n\r\nUsami is your general Tsundere gone DereDere by the end. She also has that Kureha charm with her insane strength. Plus, I damn found her cute as hell! I fell for Usami hard, loved her the entire series!\\n\\n\r\nNakaru is the cosplaying Boys Love loving lunatic. She's pretty insane, with her intense love for boys love. But, the final episode showed me a side of her that made me go \"AWWW... AWWWW!\" It was pretty fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nI might dare say this is my favorite comedy of the summer. I dare say it was actually. I have enjoyed every single episode of Mayo Chiki! I have been laughing at Jirou's poor state. Kanade giving him a hard time (Chicken-kun~), Subaru knocking him into a figurative coma. His sister beating down on him. Dear lord, he was abused wasn't he! (All the more fun for me!) \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm totally going to keep watching this to see where it goes and how funny it can get. Hopefully we'll get some more backstory on Jirou since there are some things I'm curious about his past.",

            "content": "Story & Characters (4/10)\r\nIn the world of anime, there are a variety of clich\u00e9s and stereotypes that are repeated throughout. These can be for simple nostalgic imagery, or simply to pull in a certain type of crowd. However, what separates most series is the reliance on these things and the ability to also tell an interesting story, with great characters and lovely animation. Mayo Chiki, unfortunately, prefers to go with the grain.\r\nKinjiro Sakamachi, a high school student, suffers from gynophobia. To the point of where he'll get a nose bleed whenever he has physical contact with a female and can cause him to also passout depending on the length of physical contact. During an incident in a restroom, he happens to find that the extremely popular and good looking bishie butler Subaru Konoe is actually a girl. Subaru and her master, Kanade Suzutsuki, who is more of a sadist and the mastermind, decide to \"help\" cure Kinjiro of his gynophobia. Thus, our story begins!\\n\\n\r\nWhile the concept itself is not new, nor is the story itself is somewhat fresh, what makes it interesting is the relationship between Subaru and Kinjiro. Boy finds out girl's secret, boy keeps it a secret and slowly becomes friends with girl. Girl and boy slowly start to develop feelings, and girl struggles with the fact that she wants the relationship to progress but the boy is too dense and ends up missing this meaning. Had the show stuck to this formula and build the show around this with comedy elements, it would of been a much stronger show and would of been far stronger overall as a series. Sadly, we end up with a bombardment of ecchi scenes, and a plot that goes little to nowhere with clich\u00e9s jam packed.\\n\\n\r\nMayo Chiki's biggest issue is while it does deviate from the plot itself, it seems to have a difficult time staying on track. For the first several episodes, the show actually sticks fairly well to the meat of the story and is fairly enjoyable. However, as the show progresses and we are introduced to Masamune Usami and Nakuru Narumi, we are forced to accept the fact of what this show truly is. Pure fan service and stereotypes. Sadly, for the remaining half we are forced to sit through awkward fan service and un-funny comedy scenes from time to time until we get to the big episode. Episode 8 introduces us to the big chance for the plot to change. Subaru looks to Jiro, and express to him that she doesn't want to be just friends and the episode ends. What's going to happen next? Is she going to confess, or is she going to keep it buried inside? Suspense builds and anticipation grows and then the next episode is.. Kinjiro working at a maid cafe? Wait, what? Oh by the way, that huge plot point? Simply thrown away in two lines of casual dialogue in the episode. Moments like this completely take me out of the show and frustrate me to no end, because this is the big moment for Mayo Chiki to really come out and shine, but it completely throws it all away for two filler episodes that do nothing with the gynophobia, or Subaru and Kinjiro.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show itself has one episode left, it's rather obvious that the episode is going to do little to nothing with the plot itself, as the story seems to be completely wrapped up for this first season. What are we left with? Thirteen episodes of disappointment and broken promises of what could of been a decent show. By no means are the characters bad, and at times Mayo Chiki shows signs of intelligence, but never does anything with it than simply pander to a type of crowd.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nThe one aspect of Mayo Chiki that definitely shines through is the animation itself. Characters are fluid and scenes are rather bright and full of color. While the show isn't exactly an action series, the scenes that do have Kinjiro being beaten up by his sister, Kureha, and whenever he does get kicked around by either Usami or Subaru do look rather nice.\\n\\n\r\nProbably one of the biggest shames about this series is it's well animated and very few short cuts are used, yet it is used for random fan service scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nSound, like with animation, is also rather well done. While I found the opening singer to be more ear-grating, the introduction is rather nicely done. Voice actors do a rather nice job with their lines, and I felt that Satoshi Hino, who voiced Kinjiro, really stole the show. By far being rather diverse with his dialogue. However, Yuka Iguchi (Subaru) and Eri Kitamura (Kanade) really did a nice job as well. With Eri really helping give Kanade that sadistic personality, yet at the same time giving glimpse of just how fragile she can actually be and Yuka giving Subaru a diverse vocal range of when she pretends to be a man, and her normal speaking voice.\\n\\n\r\nBy far the strongest part of Mayo Chiki.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10)\\n\r\nMayo Chiki was actually one of my genuine surprises for 2011.\\n\\n\r\nI was rather impressed with just how well constructed the series was, despite the fact that it was obviously meant to be a throw-away show just for a specific type of audience. However, it became painfully obvious that the show wouldn't break the chains it was bound in and simply ended up embracing them. While the show isn't terrible by any means, it's not going to get any new fans unless you enjoy anime cliches, a decent amount of fan service and a plot that panders around.\\n\\n\r\nIf Mayo Chiki ever ends up with a second season, I can only hope that the creators will take a chance to deviate from the norm a bit more and present us with a surprise, which is what I was hoping for the first season to be.",

Ever since I started watching this anime at ep 1, I couldn't stop! I never went to sleep I watched all the way from ep 1 to 6 from (unknown time) to 6 in the morning! It's because this anime is so beautiful and it has such a fantastic story. Every time I watched the anime, there was always something new and this anime always kept me happy. The more I watched the more I alsofell in love with the opening theme song.\\n\\n\r\nIf you ever are feeling down, rewatch this anime and it'll bring back lots of memories from when you first watched it. You'll be happier/more joyful than you expect to be. If you want to or you are watching this anime, then be sure to remember that the anime ends at ep 12, because ep 13 is just an OVA (extra episode that has no real purpose). Anyway, many people are disappointed at this anime because they wanted more (and also because they thought that ep13 was the last ep), but I accepted it's ending and it made me happier than most people. I want people to be happy for watching this great anime and accept ep 12 that it is the real ending. So remember my words when you get to ep 12, aha! I hope i inspired some of you:)\\n\r\nThis anime is the very definition of a beautiful anime! Go Mayo Chiki!!!",

I usually only feel this emptiness when I finish a series and still possess the craving for more.\r\nStory -The story is pretty basic. Typical slice of life comedy of a girl with a secret being found out by a guy who then becomes her object of affection.\r\nArt - The art is pretty good. It has a mild, yet pleasing look. Not too vibrant, not too dull. I don't know how to explain it. The characters are pretty well drawn and enjoyable.\r\nSound - TheOP is decent. It's not my favorite but it contains those \"pick up the pace towards the end\" kind of feelings. It starts off slow and mellow but after it repeats itself the pace really picks up. Gives viewers a good adrenaline rush. Ending is pretty mellow as well but I usually skip it and go to the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - The main characters are the typical bunch. Rich Girl with a butler who falls in love with the guy who finds out her butlers secret, Butler that hides her true gender and falls in love with the same guy, various girls who have a crush on the butler but end up falling for the main guy (at least 1 does, typical harem business so I don't feel like it's a spoiler), and a sister who loves her brother and doesn't want another girl to take him away.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this series and am hoping for a season 2, the ending sort of hints towards one since he mentions \"beginning of our relationship\" or whatever.\\n\\n\r\nI was really hoping that there would be more mutual feelings thrown in towards the end but I'm glad that Konoe was finally able to express her true feelings to him.\\n\\n\r\n^^^ not really a spoiler since we know thats what happens in rom coms...\\n",

If you are looking for a light-hearted romance/comedy then you've found the right anime! \r\nStory 7/10\r\nMayo Chiki is based around your self-proclaimed \"normal\" high school student Sakamachi Kinjirou who lives a not so normal everyday life. His mother is a professional wrestler and sister following in her footsteps. This leads to Sakamachi becoming a punching bag for his mother and daughter making his body develop an illness which makes his nosebleed by the simple touch of a girl! At school he attends in the same class as highschool beauty Suzutsuki Kanade who has a butler that is quite popular with the girls named Subaru Konoe. Although as our main protagonist soon finds out Konoe isn't exactly everything he appears to be! Sakamachi accidentally discovers that Konoe is actually a girl and our adventure begins! \\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't anything special but it does enough to keep your attention. It seems to have taken the road of many generic romance/comedy cross-dressing animes out there and only tries a bit to make itself different. It's typically about a girl cross-dressing as a butler attending high school and must keep her true gender a secret. Quite typical among many animes of this genre such as Maria Holic!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty well-done and nice to look at. From the character designs, to the environments and animations it all blends in well together. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was another great aspect. Besides the opening and ending the BGM fit very nicely and of course the soundtracks went according to the mood and atmosphere to give it a more emotional feel. The voice actors did a splendid job acting out the emotions from anger, cleverness, sadness, happy and so on very well. Especially during tsundere moments where they would sound angry and unpleasant one minute and sweet and gentle the next.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to get specific with each character individually but I will give you the basic idea behind them all. The characters were a bit generic such as our main protagonist Kinijirou Sakamachi, being the guy completely ignorant not knowing when a girl likes him even when it is completely obvious to those around him and the audience. Typical nice guy who tries to be helpful to everyone; however with a little fight in him when picked on by the girls.\\n\\n\r\n Then we have our girls who are border-line generic as well. Our typical tsundere Usami,  clever-witty girl Kanade, loving sister Kureha and the main female protagonist who is a mix of a little bit of everything Konoe. I think you'll find many characters like these if you've watched several romance animes however they do present them quite nicely and do show some progression in their character as the show goes on so it gets a point for that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, even though the story isn't all that fantastic I did enjoy it a lot. Since it is a romance/comedy it has its funny moments, and I must say I was cracking up throughout the whole show. Its story and simple romance is made up for in its comedy if not the comedy actually adds to the story. During the early episodes I was laughing up a storm and when I had attempted to watch this to pass the time at my college I had to shut it off before I started cracking up in class. The comedy with the added romance just made me burn through this show in one sitting, drawing me in to see how the story would all play out while breezing through the episodes simply because I was just laughing so much or had to see what happened next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMayo Chiki! is your typical romance/comedy cross-dresser anime. The story is decent and easy to figure out. Even though it's a bit generic it does have its differences and its comedy makes up a bit for what it lacks. If you are searching for a romance/comedy anime that's a bit more heavy on the comedy, then this anime may be for you! It's quite an enjoyable watch and even though it doesn't get an A grade in the romance department it does just enough to satisfy the viewer who's hungry for romance while they are getting their fill on laughs as well.They don't exactly say who our main character ends up with but it makes it quite clear in episode 12.Took awhile to decide between a 7 or 8 but in the end it gets a 7/10 due to it following a bit of a generic story and being a little to light on the romance then it should have been.  Overall I did enjoy this and would recommend it to anyone who is searching for an anime of its genre. \\n",

            "content": "What can I say about Mayo Chiki? Well for starters this is one of those anime I pick based off of just the cover art alone. For every now and then I will just randomly pick something to watch and just use the cover art to give me just the smallest indication of what the show is. \r\nThe story revolves around Jirou, a high school boy who suffers from nose bleeds when in contact with girls. A new semester begins and on his first day as well, he bumps into Kanoe Subaru in the boys toilets. This which would be a normal thing, wasn't normaldue to one thing. Kanoe Subaru so happened to be wearing panties. \\n\\n\r\nAfter a few fists flying at each other and a lot of shouting we find out that Kanoe Subaru is a girl dressing up as a boy so that she can be a butler to a rich household. Subaru then entrusts Jirou to keep it a secret from the rest of the school as if she is found out she will have to quit being a butler. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise seemed alright at first but then it quickly abandons the sense of consequence for if Subaru could be found out into a typical generic harem. For which have been tried, tested and rinsed thoroughly. \\n\\n\r\nEven more so Mayo Chikki is rated R+ yet it only shows nudity in the odd scene every now and then (which half of them being Jirou having imaginative and suggestive dreams about one of the many love interests). The characters are standard as well in terms of being no different to any other harem anime. You have the angry Tsundere, the shy girl, the know it all and then the main interest.\\n\\n\r\nNow I would be lying to you if I said I didn't enjoy the show but I did and in my opinion a 7 is a good score for this show. It is good...just not amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThe art design is average anime fare so don't expect to be wowed by it's production values. Character designs are nice but generic and more aimed at a cutesy lolicon style.The soundtrack is very forgettable to say the least (albeit a catchy opening song) there is just no emotional punch in those key scenes and an overuse of one particular track that plays in most 'normal day' episodes.\\n\\n\r\nMy only issue with the voice acting is that I sadly watched it in English dub and it wasn't very good. Some voices didn't fit naturally with certain characters but some were still serviceable i.e the main lead Jirou, so I will say watch it in Japanese.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all to sum it up, Mayo Chikki! is a good show, just not a great one and that is down to it not exploring routes that could have put depth onto its wide cast of characters. Now this is a slice of life anime, if you are a fan of that genre like myself then give it a shot or if your very critical then I would say pass on it.",

            "content": "What I expected from Mayo Chiki, and what I ended up getting were completely different. From the description, I was expecting a short 13 episode comedic anime surrounding a boy and the situations his gynophobia would get him into, and while that is slightly accurate, I did not at all expect to feel for the characters and enjoy the plot in the manner I did.\r\nSTORY/PLOT:\r\nThe plot was pretty episodic. Jirou and his gynophobia was also a pretty straight forward aspect of the story. The man is extremely sensitive, and even the slightest touch from a girl causes his blood pressure to soar. Now you canimagine poor Jirou's condition can be a rather frustrating inconvenience, and that led to some pretty funny and warming scenes. Keeping Subaru's secret was also a pretty amusing aspect of the plot, and it led to some pretty funny, and once again heart-warming scenes as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the manner in which they had Jirou and Subaru's relationship progress throughout the anime. As their relationship progressed, so too did the complexity of their character develop, which allowed me to get a feel for both them as individuals, and as a pair. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the supporting characters such as Kanade, Masamune, and Kureha were nicely fleshed out as well, with their own respective back-stories and personalities.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately I did not take a liking to Nakuru. I found her underdeveloped compared to some of the other characters, and her personality was pretty generic, however I can forgive that due to the role she serves in the plot did not necessarily require her to stand out. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: \\n\\n\r\nThere were a number of scenes in this anime that invoked feels and genuine emotion for me. Keep in mind, it was not to the severity of the emotions induced from an anime like Clannad or Toradora, the scenes which did make me tear up or feel for the characters in the were well done and positively contributed to my enjoyment of this short, funny, and sweet anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mayo Chiki focuses on Jiro the protagonist curing his fear of women. Even though Jiro had always hidden his fear for quite sometime he is forced to cure it by Suzusuki. All because of poor Jirou discovering the famed Subaru is actually a girl. The story evolves from the point where Subaru is forced to cure Jiro's phobia. Every time there is romantic moments between Jiro and Subaru there comes an awkward situation causing the comedy moments to appear. Most of the story genre is romance and some comedy here and then, but most of it's romance. The art is done really good especially howthe characters respond to a statement and think wrong and when there is romantic moments. Sound is also done really well with how the characters try to express their emotions and the background sounds to go along with the situations.  Each character has a unique type of personality that is fun to figure out.\\n\\n\r\nJiro - One of the main characters the story focuses on and is the character that struggles to cure his gynophobia. Jiro is the first character introduced in the manga when it begins. He keeps away from girls to make sure he doesn\u2019t pass out from a nosebleed. Once he is forced to be cured by Suzutsuki he suffers from going through a lot of treatments. The thing in Jiro\u2019s character that is interesting to look at is how he responds to Suzutsuki\u2019s treatments and what happens to him just to cure his problem.\\n\r\nSuzutsuki \u2013 Another main character in Mayo Chiki, who tries to cure Jiro of his gynophobia in exchange Jiro has to keep Subaru\u2019s secret. She doesn\u2019t really care what happens to Jirou while he goes through his treatment. She has a mysterious type of personality so you don\u2019t know how she really is like. Her personality is interesting because sometimes she does want to help Jiro, but most of the time she tortures him. \\n\r\nSubaru \u2013 A main character in Mayo Chiki who is discovered to be a girl by Jiro and stays by him to make sure he doesn\u2019t say her secret. She obeys her master command no matter what it is, which makes her a very interesting character. When she is with Jiro she reacts awkwardly to him causing them to be in strange situations. She usually thinks the wrong way to something that isn\u2019t.\\n\r\nOverall this anime deserves a nine because of all the genres and situations it features. Although if you are looking for my comedy and romance then you should check out the manga because it continues with the storyline.",

            "content": "Before I write anything for this anime, I will say something very important. This anime is really fun and enjoyable, no matter who watches it.\r\nPEOPLE WHO WILL (most probably) ENJOY THIS ANIME:\r\nPeople who enjoy light stories, with funny characters, some stupid drama and cute reactions.\r\nPEOPLE WHO WILL NOT (most probably) ENJOY THIS ANIME:\r\nPeople who are bored of typical anime stories and can't stand fan service or ecchi anime.\r\nSo, to kick off the review I will start with the story.\r\nStory (8/10) : The story is pretty original, considering the genre. A girl who dresses like a guy falls in love with a guy that can't staynear girls. Pretty cheesy and cliche, but it suits the style of this anime. It's developement is decent and the end is really cool. So, yeah, pretty much you have a complete story of a typical ecchi/harem/romance anime, but it's really well done, that's why I rate it 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10) : The art is really well done, with smooth animation, unusual for this kind of anime. Not much to say here, because it is not unique, but it's still eye candy (for me at least).\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) : Not much to say for the sound. The voice acting is good, the OST I don't even remember it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10) : Considering the genre the characters develop fairly well.\\n\r\nSakamachi (Main) : He is your typical anime protagonist, with the small detail that he can't stay near women. It's really cool to watch how he creates relationships with some girls and how he learns to adapt. Also, his reaction are really funny.\\n\r\nKonoe (Main) : Cool buttler boy, who proves to be a kawai girl. Really nice developement on this character and I really enjoyed the romance between her and Sakamachi.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters aren't super wow, but they fit the plot like a glove.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) :  I think the anime is really enjoyable, for most people at least. It radiates a good feeling and you can watch it without having to worry about anything. Funny, sad, cute. All these are good for a comedy anime, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10) : I believe that this anime is a great example of new-gen comedy anime. It is fun. it is well done and it is complete. Maybe the ending doesn't fit to everyone, it's still a legit ending. It sure has some flaws here and there, like excessive fan service at some points, but some people enjoy it, some not. Generally, it is an anime I would reccomend to anyone who would like to spend some time to enjoy a nice anime.",

The entire anime, you can tell that the romance is there, but never really goes beyond a few awkward moments and a few kisses, the two never really get together. In the end, I longed for more, and to see where it would go with the two, but they left it up in the air, and with no sign of a second season to possibly wrap things up. As I said, I enjoyed the anime, but the end wasvery lacking and had me wanting more. Kinda like opening your favorite cereal in the morning, only to find that there isn't enough left for a nice bowl of morning cereal.",

They give what they should give, but they rarely give me what I want, and maybe I'm expecting too much.\r\nIt's a perfectly enjoyable rom com. Everything is as it should be. The general characters archetypes, the twist within the premise, likeable enough characters, and enough humor to get by.\r\nYet, the \"romance\" part seems... lacking. This is more an issue with the genre as a whole then Mayo Chiki. Genuine romantic resolution always seems out of grasp.The characters that need to get together never do get together, and when the series is over, you begin to wonder what the point of it all was.",

It is better if you.....\r\nOh wait a minute, this isn't the Cook's Review! My bad folks... It's just that mayonnaise is my most favorite condiment and it goes well with any food. Heck I'm watching this anime while eating mayo out of a jar!\r\n(For those who does not know what Mayo is, I can assure you, it's not an musical instrument.)\r\nAnyways, onward with the review!\r\nMayo Chiki! is a abbreviation of MayoeruShitsuji to Chikin na Ore to. Mayo Chiki (the anime) is not to be confused with Mayo Chiki (the food) Only God knows who's idiotic enough to mix them both up.. Heh.. heh...\\n\r\nTranslation: The Wavering Butler and Myself the Chicken\\n\\n\r\nProduced by TBS and Feel, yes you heard me right... \"Feel\" people responsible for making popular fan service titles such as \"Kiss X Sis\" and \"Yosuga no Sora\" so is it wrong to presume equivalent amount of needless fan-service in this anime? BOING!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a youthful boy named SakamaCHI KINjiro (see what I did there?) who discovered Subaru Konoe, a fellow classmate, secret of being a TRAP! Subaru must presume the role of a male because guys are just so awesome that every girl wants to be guys... Ehmm.. I mean it's a tradition of her family for every male family member to be the butler to the [Insert rich generic family who probably gained their wealth by stepping on us poor peasants] What will happen to our hero? Now of course if you know the genre an anime is the \"comedy and romance combo\" then there's a good chance our hero will get ABUSED physically and mentally by practically everyone. And I mean EVERYONE. Yes, even by his mom. Poor lad..\\n\\n\r\nAs the Chief Animation Director, Kawamura Kousuke was entasked with character design, which he executed exceptionally well. Though I never did read the light novel, I'm assuming fans had no qualms about his depiction of what the author of the light novel was trying to portray. \\n\\n\r\nI was expecting this anime to be nonsensical and hilarious, revolving around pervertic shenanigans, so I was assuming the music to be upbeat and mischievousness just like the cast. Well, you can't go wrong with Kitamura Eri right? The OP is a perfect example how the author is trying to tell is that unlike the usual Romcom genre, the crossdressing Subaru is the main player, not the Chicken, Kinjiro. It shows how everyone loves Subaru, and doesn't give a damn about Kinjiro. I feel your pain Kinjiro... Your mum hates you, now everyone else ignores you. We are so alike.. (yes, I too am in love with a cross dresser)\\n\r\nKudos to the selection of cast for seiyuus as well. They are able to use their voice to portray the character's personality quite well.\\n\\n\r\nSo lets move on to characters...\\n\\n\r\n[Sakamachi, Kinjirou]\\n\r\nThe target of everyone's abuse. Currently living with his sister and his mum. His dad passed away when he was a young boy. Did I mention that his mum is a professional wrestler?\\n\r\nSo I think this is how it went down.\\n\r\nKinjirou's Dad: Honey, make me a sandwich!\\n\r\nKinjirou's Mum: ...........\\n\r\n[THE NEXT DAY KINJIROU'S DAD IS HOSPITALIZED]\\n\\n\r\nI guess you could say he got.... \\n\r\n*puts on sunglasses*\\n\r\nA Knuckle Sandwich...\\n\r\nYEEEEAAAAAAH!!! [Cue CSI Miami OP song]\\n\\n\r\nEhmm... Ok enough with the lame jokes...\\n\r\nMy condolences to Kinjiro, his dad was a good man, just with the wrong women. Anyways, due to his father escaping his miserable fate, Kinjiro gets abused by his mother and sister instead. (Now kiddos this is an anime, if you know a child being abused by his parents in real life, please tell social service. Thank you) This causes him to develop Gynophobia (fear of women) and his body reacts to this phobia by secreting blood from his nose. Which is weird because, I don't know, don't normally main male lead in RomCom gets punched by a girl after his nose starts bleeding? So doesn't these nosebleeds makes it worse? So in a nutshell, he doesn't want to be touched by girls. So is it a sign for him to turn to the gay side?\\n\r\nKinjiro is reliable, when time comes, and he is depended heavily on Subaru. Which is good because he is the one responsible most of the time for bringing the \"dere\" side out of her.\\n\\n\r\n[Konoe Subaru]\\n\r\nThe generic trap in every anime who makes fun of flat chested girls. Though she looks nothing like a flat chest girl! This is blasphemy! Now even girls with B cup sizes can look like a guy in 5 easy steps? She is also the main source of Yaoi and Yuri jokes in the anime. (How is that even possible?) As the butler to the Suzutsuki family, she serves the current heir Kanade Suzutsuki. She has the best of both worlds. Wanted both by males and females. She is an interesting character to me. She has her own harem (a tsundere with a harem? Even more blasphemy!), however her harem consists of the same gender. So do I label it as a harem or as a reverse harem? Plus, if she likes Kinjiro and Kinjiro himself gets a harem, so wouldn't that be a harem within a harem?\\n\r\nHAREMCEPTION!\\n\\n\r\n[Kanade Suzutsuki]\\n\r\nBishojo and a sadist. Deadly combo, but a dream come true to every masochists. She plays as the childhood friend in Subaru's harem... Or reverse harem.. Or whatever, I don't know anymore. She acts as the mediator between Kinjiro and Subaru's relationship, though she preferably likes torturing them more. However, she honestly do want to help cure Kinjiro of his phobia (probably by draining all his blood so he can't get nosebleeds anymore)\\n\\n\r\n[Other Cast]\\n\r\n-Includes Kinjiro's sister who wants to be a wrestler as well. Also part of Subaru's harem.\\n\r\n-Other maid belonging to the Suzutsuki family. Also part of Subaru's harem.\\n\r\n-Some parody of the KKK cult who loves Subaru, also part of.... Ok, this is getting repetitive. I'll just say this once, every other cast is in Subaru's Harem. Capiche?\\n\r\n-The Yaoi group who supports Subaru-Kinjiro relationship. \\n\\n\r\nThough having an interesting title with a slightly promising premise, Mayo Chiki! does lack a source of innovation, story and character wise perhaps. I mean even the 4 main cast have the same initials, K.S. (That does not come from abbreviation Kill steal, mind you)\\n\r\nIt needs a greater impact on the audiences so that they'll be able to differentiate this anime from every other RomCom there is. (I'm sorry but there are already a couple of cross dressing RomCom in the anime world and I'm sure this is not the end of it) Putting lots of fan-service may pique my interest for a moment, though it will last as long as my attention span (which is actually really short) Though, I must admit even if the story is not so original, the humor is entertaining. It doesn't take much for me to chuckle to even generic yaoi or yuri jokes. Perhaps more development in the future would lead to a more memorable cast.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion, in recent months, introduction of crossdressing characters have been rapidly increasing, so I'm not sure if that's a new fetish or something you people have? Maybe it's a bisexual thing? But I don't think that's a good idea since you're opening yourself up to be rejected by both sexes? Anyways, Mayo Chiki! is a decent RomCom to kill time with. Hilarity plus it doesn't dwell too deep in logic but it gets your mind blown with question once in a while like,\"IF SHE IS AFRAID OF KNIVES, HOW IS SHE GOING TO STAY IN THE KITCHEN?\" or something like that. \\n\r\nYou will laugh, you will cry, you will do plenty of face palm, but most importantly, you will remember that no matter how tempting being the opposite sex must feel like, be grateful of how you were intended to be created...... And be thankful that you're not allergic to the opposite sex, cause that's just SUCKS dude.... If you know what I mean ;)\\n\\n\r\nHaremu Kingu,\\n\r\nSinging Off!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It started out very well and interesting; and the more episodes I watched, the more I fell in love with the anime.\r\nEach episode kept me more and more interested in the anime. And even with my second run-through of rewatching the whole anime, I felt the same joy... there was a happiness that I felt more and more as I watched and enjoyed the series.\r\nThere is romance, ecchi (not ridiculous ecchi), comedy, & cross-dressing, and it's very entertaining. To me, I felt this anime was much of a generic romcom (romance/comedy)... where it doesn't teach muchor give meaningful insights on symbolism to life and such. But that it's entertainment purposes, of which it does very well in providing that!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is about romance between main character Jirou (male) and slightly less main character Subaru (female). Its interesting plot is set to expand upon the episodes of bonding between these two who started off on the wrong foot. There are also a few important supporting characters who are very likable; they assist in moving the story forward and supporting the main character. Having these side characters each play their unique roles in the story along with their interactions with the main protagonist really makes this anime a joy and laugh to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song also really grew on me and if you watch it, it'll grow on you too. The pacing itself is very well done throughout the series; giving me such a high incentive to continue watching, I marathoned the whole 12 episodes and skipped my sleep that night  >->  However, many people including myself felt that there was something missing from/after the conclusion.\\n\r\nHave you ever watched those anime's where it is good, but there is something that you just want from it, something more...  even though you've already finished all the episodes? That's how this anime is. However, it is very enjoyable nonetheless. I know that the anime may leave fans wanting more, but accepting its conclusion appreciates the enjoyment that came from the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI would say that satisfaction varies upon viewers around: 7.75 to 8.75 out of 10.",

The story also seems to be interesting, but this alsocomes from a personal preference that I like to stories about a female that crossdresses as a male. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is nice, I don't usually like guys with glasses but the art in this anime is capable of making the protagonist good looking to me. I also like how when Subaru is dressed as a boy the effect of actually making her look and sound like a male can be achieved, unlike in Ouran High School Host Club where Haruhi still retains some femininity, which fits the story well.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist, Kinjirou, seems to be average looking but his fear of women, and his body's \"special\" ability, as well as his family make him seem above average. His little sister has an interesting personality and reminds me a bit of Minori Kushieda from Toradora! Subaru seems to be fully into the part of a male and a butler but also has a feminine side which is to be expected.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd say this anime is worth watching. It probably won't make it into your favorites but it's not bad by any means.",

Visually Mayo Chiki is well animated and the character designs are well done, even though they all seem a little too familiar. There is nothing new which makes this series stand out from other anime of the same genre so I don't expect anyone to watch this series and regard it at one of their favourite animes of the year, but it does make for a good gap fillerin between some of the better releases planned for this summer. This is an easy to watch anime, there is nothing complicated or mind blowing about the story or the visuals but in the end it's still a fun series to pass the time while waiting for something better to come along. \\n\\n\r\nReview by Charles Shepherd\\n\r\nwww.electricbloomwebzine.blogspot.com",

            "content": "There are still a couple of episodes to go, now that all main characters have been featured it is time to make my review, and my ratings are:\r\n  Story- fair 6.\r\nThe plot of the story is very simple and it is for the El Pollo ( Spanish for \"Chicken\" and I'm referring to Sakamachi Kinjirou) to protect the cross dressing chiquita's ( Konoe Subaru the female lead) secret after he accidentally discovered it, which, by the way nearly ended his life, the arc of the story is not something were the chiquita (Konoe) moves into the El Pollo's (Jirou) life to mess things up.Actually, it is more like an accidental romance waiting to happen, but there are some challenges along the way for the 2, and it always involves the chiquita's mistress, Kanade who too bored with everyday life and finds fun in putting the 2 in a lot of awkward situations.\\n\\n\r\nArt- mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself can be compared to other animes like \"Infinite Stratos,\" \"Working,\" and \"Toradora.\"\\n\\n\r\nSound - good 7.\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is that i like both the opening and ending themes, I also admire Konoe's seiyu Yuka Iguchi, if I'm not mistaken she once did a voice of some rich man's daughter in \"Mayoi Neko Overrun\" as Chise Umemori, I really can't believe that she can do voices of someone who's childish and someone who's like a MILF. Frankly, Konoe's voice actually sounds like a MILF than a dude.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: decent 4.\\n\\n\r\nI said decent, co'z their are some info about the characters which were somewhat mismentioned so some added info about them should be appropriate, so let's start with the following:\\n\\n\r\nKonoe Subaru- Info states that she works for the Suzutsuki's estate as a butler?????? Ok,  that's a given, her immediate ward is the young and diabolical Mistress Kanade at first- before the El Pollo (Jirou) discovers her true gender, life for her is just the usual: serve the mistress(Kanade) with the utmost dedication which may probably include playing along with the latter's sexual advances ( she (Kanade) did mentioned that she has feelings for her)  , do good in school, and be careful that no one finds out your true gender. Upon meeting the El Pollo (Jirou) through unusual circumstances, life for her has somewhat change co'z she's now faced with the predicament of  balancing her dedication with her mistress (Kanade) and her feelings for the El Pollo(Jirou). In ep9, the chiquita (Konoe) has stated that she wants to be the El Pollo's best friend, however it may also suggest that she is just being careful because her mistress (Kanade) might hear it and plan a bigger scheme to have more fun. By the way in this anime, she's the one with the balls here, since it was her who does all the buttkicking not only towards the El Pollo (Jirou), but to other cast as well.   \\n\\n\r\nSakamachi Kinjirou - As stated, he's called \"Chicken\" not only because he's a wuss, but because went one is to combine the last 3 letters from his surname with the first 3 letters of his first name you get a misspelled word \"Chikin.\" Kanade would either call him \"Chikin\" but most of the time she will address him as \"Jirou,\" for Usami, she would call him \"Baka Chikin,\" most of the time that is, especially when she's pissed, in fact she is always pissed at the El Pollo (that's what I call him and again that's \"Chicken\" in Spanish). This poor El Pollo (Jirou) went through a lot in the hands of his sadistic wrestling superstar mom and his equally sadistic sister, which later on he developed a certain disease call \"Gynophobia\" that cause him to develop sever nose bleed when touched by a girl, ok so we all know that,duh. The thing about him, is that he's one gynophobic who can  still talk to girls- from a certain distance that is, be in a classroom with girls around provided by that his seatmate is Kurose Yamato his classmate way back from junior high, it is even suggested that they both used to share and exchange porn mags and it may also suggested that he also experiences sexual arousal's when viewing such lewd publications. Info states, that he's capable of fighting, but in one episode all I saw was (at least in this anime) is him  putting up alright, but ending up being punching bag as usual when he encounters the chiquita's father (Subaru Nagare) in disguise. Another thing about the El Pollo, is that he always falls victim not only with Kanade's  schemes but also with her sexual advances as well, it is not known whether or not the mistress (Kanade) has any feelings for him or was he just being teased for fun by the latter, but what is known is that all she did promise to help him cure her Gynophobia.........or at least that is what she always says. \\n\\n\r\nKanade Suzutsuki - well, she's rich, she's pampered, she's the school principal's only kid, she's spoiled and most of all, she's bored, the moment she found out that one of the student discovered her butler's secret she instantly hit upon an idea to have fun with the 2 parties involved. That is, to manipulate her butler's blind obedience and to make use of the poor El Pollo's stupidity coupled with his psychological disorder. It is suggested that she's bisexual, since info suggest that she has feeling both for the chiquita (Konoe) and for the El Pollo since she both  teases them, however, to whom she more into is yet to be known. As for the background of this character, I can't seem to understand  that for her to be a principal's daughter is an understatement because school principles don't have such luxurious privileges and the school where this character is in don't look like some high class institution where it is exclusive for the rich, in fact most of the characters who are attending that school seems to just be part of the middle class.\\n\\n\r\nUsami Masamune - also called \"Usamin\" by the El Pollo, well all know that she's a former member of some radical fan group called S4 or better known as \"Shooting Star Sabaru Sama,\"  of course no harem would be complete without a tsundere who's also competition for the El Pollo's affection. She's also one of those who kicks the El Pollo's ass, cute as she is, I'm still for Konoe to be the El Pollo's love interest.\\n\\n\r\nKureha Sakamachi - It is hard to say if whether or not if she has a brotherly complex for the El Pollo, what is known is that she always practices her wrestling move against her brother and she like tomatoes  a lot. And recently she has a crush on the chiquita (Konoe), but I wonder if she'll become lesbian when she finds out that that chiquita (Konoe) is a girl.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNakuru Narumi - For a ganguro who's a fan of BL (Boys Love.....EEEEEEWWWW) I don't see her flaunting her collection of BL manga, the only thing she's flaunting is her fetish for glasses, ok so she's the chairwoman of a group of BL fans called \u201cLet\u2019s warmly protect Sabaru Sama,\" but I don't see her being with her group, the only person she's with most of the time is with the El Pollo's sister Kureha and sometime she's seen with Usami. She probably the only character who get's drunk on carbonated drinks and can turn into a perverted lesbian or a bisexual.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment- good 7.\\n\\n\r\nWhat make this anime enjoyable is its comedy and romance genre,  this is one anime were the bellas (female cast) are on top and the hombres (male cast) are the underdogs. Also, this anime has quite an unusual harem genre in it, were it is shared both by the chiquita (Konoe) and by the El Pollo (Jirou), there are of course some ecchi in it but it is a bit subtle and safe enough to be view by a 13 year old with parental supervision. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - good 7.\\n\\n\r\nLike I've said, there are still a couple of episodes to go, however, I kinda have a feeling that the chiquita (Konoe) will probably come clean and the El Pollo will still be Gynophobic, but, here's the thing, it is possible that even though the chiquita (Konoe) has come clean, the remaining female class will turn lesbian and the El Pollo will be left in the sides, let's just say that there is part of the opening theme which serves as a give away, if it is, I guess we just have to wait and see.                 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Fully Updated to Final Episode.\r\nGoing into Mayo Chiki! I thought I was gonna get a generic anime with some ecchi sprinkled on top. I regret that train of thought completely. Its not a generic anime with ecchi sprinkled on top, its an anime with AMAZINGLY placed ecchi and hilarity combined with a decent story and great characters! \r\nStory:\r\nThe story is heading in a way that Jirou and Subaru's friendship keeps growing with each passing episode, with events bringing them closer together. It also looks like Subaru and Kanade's friendship will be slowly restored to what it once was before an incident in their past. Italso keeps that comedic aspect with Kureha's love for Subaru and Kanade causing great misunderstandings that cause Jirou hell every episode. This never stopped even til the very end, with the final episode just being a cluster of misunderstandings and perversion. It went out with a bang!\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nIt's pleasing to the eyes, the colors are vivid, the characters are well designed, with a wide array of different character styles being used, from kiddy designs (Jiriou's tomboy sister) to mature cosplay (The catgirl cosplayer in episode one). \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI found the Opening and Ending themes to be quite appealing to listen to. They aren't amazing amazing, but they are still really nice and go really well with the anime and the opening and ending sequences respectively. With each passing episode I seem to love the music more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nJirou is that cool geek guy you get every once in a while. The man with Gynophobia due to... family problems. That... surprised me to say the least, and sadly for him he's been labeled as gay to to his gynopobia. That alone made me like his character since normally the guys are either accidental pervs or are no balled men that can't stand up to girls. Jirou is none of that, he likes his women! He just fears for his life due to his family! Totally waiting to see if he can get over his fear of girls in some way. By the looks of things, his gynophobia is going to stay for quite sometime at the rate things are going. Not that I mind, its hilarious to see.\\n\\n\r\nSubaru is the trap butler that never gets old. But, Subaru... is absurdly cute. Having to be such a serious butler for Kanade and then able to go into an extremely girl state amuses me to no end! Her affection of sheep is adorable as well! From the first episode I thought she might have no weaknesses, but gravely mistaken as in episode 3 a childhood fear is revealed, making her more likeable since she isn't \"invincible\". \\n\\n\r\nKanade seemed innocent at first, which I was like \"Sure ok, every anime needs the innocent Ojou-Sama\". I was naive, There is nothing innocent in that woman. At all. I won't spoil anything, go watch the first episode to understand why I say such things. I said this all before episode three. She does have her kind side of course, since she does care for Subaru and the others as shown this episode. But.. She's still pretty darn evil when she has nothing better to do!\\n\\n\r\n Kureha is that insanely strong tomboy you see once in a blue moon. She is insanely strong, having fought a bear on equal footing, only breaking an arm in the process. She also has one hell of a variety of wrestling moves. I was in love!\\n\\n\r\nUsami is your general Tsundere gone DereDere by the end. She also has that Kureha charm with her insane strength. Plus, I damn found her cute as hell! I fell for Usami hard, loved her the entire series!\\n\\n\r\nNakaru is the cosplaying Boys Love loving lunatic. She's pretty insane, with her intense love for boys love. But, the final episode showed me a side of her that made me go \"AWWW... AWWWW!\" It was pretty fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nI might dare say this is my favorite comedy of the summer. I dare say it was actually. I have enjoyed every single episode of Mayo Chiki! I have been laughing at Jirou's poor state. Kanade giving him a hard time (Chicken-kun~), Subaru knocking him into a figurative coma. His sister beating down on him. Dear lord, he was abused wasn't he! (All the more fun for me!) \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm totally going to keep watching this to see where it goes and how funny it can get. Hopefully we'll get some more backstory on Jirou since there are some things I'm curious about his past.",

            "content": "Story & Characters (4/10)\r\nIn the world of anime, there are a variety of clich\u00e9s and stereotypes that are repeated throughout. These can be for simple nostalgic imagery, or simply to pull in a certain type of crowd. However, what separates most series is the reliance on these things and the ability to also tell an interesting story, with great characters and lovely animation. Mayo Chiki, unfortunately, prefers to go with the grain.\r\nKinjiro Sakamachi, a high school student, suffers from gynophobia. To the point of where he'll get a nose bleed whenever he has physical contact with a female and can cause him to also passout depending on the length of physical contact. During an incident in a restroom, he happens to find that the extremely popular and good looking bishie butler Subaru Konoe is actually a girl. Subaru and her master, Kanade Suzutsuki, who is more of a sadist and the mastermind, decide to \"help\" cure Kinjiro of his gynophobia. Thus, our story begins!\\n\\n\r\nWhile the concept itself is not new, nor is the story itself is somewhat fresh, what makes it interesting is the relationship between Subaru and Kinjiro. Boy finds out girl's secret, boy keeps it a secret and slowly becomes friends with girl. Girl and boy slowly start to develop feelings, and girl struggles with the fact that she wants the relationship to progress but the boy is too dense and ends up missing this meaning. Had the show stuck to this formula and build the show around this with comedy elements, it would of been a much stronger show and would of been far stronger overall as a series. Sadly, we end up with a bombardment of ecchi scenes, and a plot that goes little to nowhere with clich\u00e9s jam packed.\\n\\n\r\nMayo Chiki's biggest issue is while it does deviate from the plot itself, it seems to have a difficult time staying on track. For the first several episodes, the show actually sticks fairly well to the meat of the story and is fairly enjoyable. However, as the show progresses and we are introduced to Masamune Usami and Nakuru Narumi, we are forced to accept the fact of what this show truly is. Pure fan service and stereotypes. Sadly, for the remaining half we are forced to sit through awkward fan service and un-funny comedy scenes from time to time until we get to the big episode. Episode 8 introduces us to the big chance for the plot to change. Subaru looks to Jiro, and express to him that she doesn't want to be just friends and the episode ends. What's going to happen next? Is she going to confess, or is she going to keep it buried inside? Suspense builds and anticipation grows and then the next episode is.. Kinjiro working at a maid cafe? Wait, what? Oh by the way, that huge plot point? Simply thrown away in two lines of casual dialogue in the episode. Moments like this completely take me out of the show and frustrate me to no end, because this is the big moment for Mayo Chiki to really come out and shine, but it completely throws it all away for two filler episodes that do nothing with the gynophobia, or Subaru and Kinjiro.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show itself has one episode left, it's rather obvious that the episode is going to do little to nothing with the plot itself, as the story seems to be completely wrapped up for this first season. What are we left with? Thirteen episodes of disappointment and broken promises of what could of been a decent show. By no means are the characters bad, and at times Mayo Chiki shows signs of intelligence, but never does anything with it than simply pander to a type of crowd.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nThe one aspect of Mayo Chiki that definitely shines through is the animation itself. Characters are fluid and scenes are rather bright and full of color. While the show isn't exactly an action series, the scenes that do have Kinjiro being beaten up by his sister, Kureha, and whenever he does get kicked around by either Usami or Subaru do look rather nice.\\n\\n\r\nProbably one of the biggest shames about this series is it's well animated and very few short cuts are used, yet it is used for random fan service scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nSound, like with animation, is also rather well done. While I found the opening singer to be more ear-grating, the introduction is rather nicely done. Voice actors do a rather nice job with their lines, and I felt that Satoshi Hino, who voiced Kinjiro, really stole the show. By far being rather diverse with his dialogue. However, Yuka Iguchi (Subaru) and Eri Kitamura (Kanade) really did a nice job as well. With Eri really helping give Kanade that sadistic personality, yet at the same time giving glimpse of just how fragile she can actually be and Yuka giving Subaru a diverse vocal range of when she pretends to be a man, and her normal speaking voice.\\n\\n\r\nBy far the strongest part of Mayo Chiki.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10)\\n\r\nMayo Chiki was actually one of my genuine surprises for 2011.\\n\\n\r\nI was rather impressed with just how well constructed the series was, despite the fact that it was obviously meant to be a throw-away show just for a specific type of audience. However, it became painfully obvious that the show wouldn't break the chains it was bound in and simply ended up embracing them. While the show isn't terrible by any means, it's not going to get any new fans unless you enjoy anime cliches, a decent amount of fan service and a plot that panders around.\\n\\n\r\nIf Mayo Chiki ever ends up with a second season, I can only hope that the creators will take a chance to deviate from the norm a bit more and present us with a surprise, which is what I was hoping for the first season to be.",

Ever since I started watching this anime at ep 1, I couldn't stop! I never went to sleep I watched all the way from ep 1 to 6 from (unknown time) to 6 in the morning! It's because this anime is so beautiful and it has such a fantastic story. Every time I watched the anime, there was always something new and this anime always kept me happy. The more I watched the more I alsofell in love with the opening theme song.\\n\\n\r\nIf you ever are feeling down, rewatch this anime and it'll bring back lots of memories from when you first watched it. You'll be happier/more joyful than you expect to be. If you want to or you are watching this anime, then be sure to remember that the anime ends at ep 12, because ep 13 is just an OVA (extra episode that has no real purpose). Anyway, many people are disappointed at this anime because they wanted more (and also because they thought that ep13 was the last ep), but I accepted it's ending and it made me happier than most people. I want people to be happy for watching this great anime and accept ep 12 that it is the real ending. So remember my words when you get to ep 12, aha! I hope i inspired some of you:)\\n\r\nThis anime is the very definition of a beautiful anime! Go Mayo Chiki!!!",

I usually only feel this emptiness when I finish a series and still possess the craving for more.\r\nStory -The story is pretty basic. Typical slice of life comedy of a girl with a secret being found out by a guy who then becomes her object of affection.\r\nArt - The art is pretty good. It has a mild, yet pleasing look. Not too vibrant, not too dull. I don't know how to explain it. The characters are pretty well drawn and enjoyable.\r\nSound - TheOP is decent. It's not my favorite but it contains those \"pick up the pace towards the end\" kind of feelings. It starts off slow and mellow but after it repeats itself the pace really picks up. Gives viewers a good adrenaline rush. Ending is pretty mellow as well but I usually skip it and go to the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - The main characters are the typical bunch. Rich Girl with a butler who falls in love with the guy who finds out her butlers secret, Butler that hides her true gender and falls in love with the same guy, various girls who have a crush on the butler but end up falling for the main guy (at least 1 does, typical harem business so I don't feel like it's a spoiler), and a sister who loves her brother and doesn't want another girl to take him away.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this series and am hoping for a season 2, the ending sort of hints towards one since he mentions \"beginning of our relationship\" or whatever.\\n\\n\r\nI was really hoping that there would be more mutual feelings thrown in towards the end but I'm glad that Konoe was finally able to express her true feelings to him.\\n\\n\r\n^^^ not really a spoiler since we know thats what happens in rom coms...\\n",

            "content": "If you're looking for a serious, dramatic romance anime then this is not the anime for you. If you are looking for a light-hearted romance/comedy then you've found the right anime! \r\nStory 7/10\r\nMayo Chiki is based around your self-proclaimed \"normal\" high school student Sakamachi Kinjirou who lives a not so normal everyday life. His mother is a professional wrestler and sister following in her footsteps. This leads to Sakamachi becoming a punching bag for his mother and daughter making his body develop an illness which makes his nosebleed by the simple touch of a girl! At school he attends in the same class as highschool beauty Suzutsuki Kanade who has a butler that is quite popular with the girls named Subaru Konoe. Although as our main protagonist soon finds out Konoe isn't exactly everything he appears to be! Sakamachi accidentally discovers that Konoe is actually a girl and our adventure begins! \\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't anything special but it does enough to keep your attention. It seems to have taken the road of many generic romance/comedy cross-dressing animes out there and only tries a bit to make itself different. It's typically about a girl cross-dressing as a butler attending high school and must keep her true gender a secret. Quite typical among many animes of this genre such as Maria Holic!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty well-done and nice to look at. From the character designs, to the environments and animations it all blends in well together. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was another great aspect. Besides the opening and ending the BGM fit very nicely and of course the soundtracks went according to the mood and atmosphere to give it a more emotional feel. The voice actors did a splendid job acting out the emotions from anger, cleverness, sadness, happy and so on very well. Especially during tsundere moments where they would sound angry and unpleasant one minute and sweet and gentle the next.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to get specific with each character individually but I will give you the basic idea behind them all. The characters were a bit generic such as our main protagonist Kinijirou Sakamachi, being the guy completely ignorant not knowing when a girl likes him even when it is completely obvious to those around him and the audience. Typical nice guy who tries to be helpful to everyone; however with a little fight in him when picked on by the girls.\\n\\n\r\n Then we have our girls who are border-line generic as well. Our typical tsundere Usami,  clever-witty girl Kanade, loving sister Kureha and the main female protagonist who is a mix of a little bit of everything Konoe. I think you'll find many characters like these if you've watched several romance animes however they do present them quite nicely and do show some progression in their character as the show goes on so it gets a point for that.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, even though the story isn't all that fantastic I did enjoy it a lot. Since it is a romance/comedy it has its funny moments, and I must say I was cracking up throughout the whole show. Its story and simple romance is made up for in its comedy if not the comedy actually adds to the story. During the early episodes I was laughing up a storm and when I had attempted to watch this to pass the time at my college I had to shut it off before I started cracking up in class. The comedy with the added romance just made me burn through this show in one sitting, drawing me in to see how the story would all play out while breezing through the episodes simply because I was just laughing so much or had to see what happened next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMayo Chiki! is your typical romance/comedy cross-dresser anime. The story is decent and easy to figure out. Even though it's a bit generic it does have its differences and its comedy makes up a bit for what it lacks. If you are searching for a romance/comedy anime that's a bit more heavy on the comedy, then this anime may be for you! It's quite an enjoyable watch and even though it doesn't get an A grade in the romance department it does just enough to satisfy the viewer who's hungry for romance while they are getting their fill on laughs as well.They don't exactly say who our main character ends up with but it makes it quite clear in episode 12.Took awhile to decide between a 7 or 8 but in the end it gets a 7/10 due to it following a bit of a generic story and being a little to light on the romance then it should have been.  Overall I did enjoy this and would recommend it to anyone who is searching for an anime of its genre. \\n",

            "content": "What can I say about Mayo Chiki? Well for starters this is one of those anime I pick based off of just the cover art alone. For every now and then I will just randomly pick something to watch and just use the cover art to give me just the smallest indication of what the show is. \r\nThe story revolves around Jirou, a high school boy who suffers from nose bleeds when in contact with girls. A new semester begins and on his first day as well, he bumps into Kanoe Subaru in the boys toilets. This which would be a normal thing, wasn't normaldue to one thing. Kanoe Subaru so happened to be wearing panties. \\n\\n\r\nAfter a few fists flying at each other and a lot of shouting we find out that Kanoe Subaru is a girl dressing up as a boy so that she can be a butler to a rich household. Subaru then entrusts Jirou to keep it a secret from the rest of the school as if she is found out she will have to quit being a butler. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise seemed alright at first but then it quickly abandons the sense of consequence for if Subaru could be found out into a typical generic harem. For which have been tried, tested and rinsed thoroughly. \\n\\n\r\nEven more so Mayo Chikki is rated R+ yet it only shows nudity in the odd scene every now and then (which half of them being Jirou having imaginative and suggestive dreams about one of the many love interests). The characters are standard as well in terms of being no different to any other harem anime. You have the angry Tsundere, the shy girl, the know it all and then the main interest.\\n\\n\r\nNow I would be lying to you if I said I didn't enjoy the show but I did and in my opinion a 7 is a good score for this show. It is good...just not amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThe art design is average anime fare so don't expect to be wowed by it's production values. Character designs are nice but generic and more aimed at a cutesy lolicon style.The soundtrack is very forgettable to say the least (albeit a catchy opening song) there is just no emotional punch in those key scenes and an overuse of one particular track that plays in most 'normal day' episodes.\\n\\n\r\nMy only issue with the voice acting is that I sadly watched it in English dub and it wasn't very good. Some voices didn't fit naturally with certain characters but some were still serviceable i.e the main lead Jirou, so I will say watch it in Japanese.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all to sum it up, Mayo Chikki! is a good show, just not a great one and that is down to it not exploring routes that could have put depth onto its wide cast of characters. Now this is a slice of life anime, if you are a fan of that genre like myself then give it a shot or if your very critical then I would say pass on it.",

            "content": "What I expected from Mayo Chiki, and what I ended up getting were completely different. From the description, I was expecting a short 13 episode comedic anime surrounding a boy and the situations his gynophobia would get him into, and while that is slightly accurate, I did not at all expect to feel for the characters and enjoy the plot in the manner I did.\r\nSTORY/PLOT:\r\nThe plot was pretty episodic. Jirou and his gynophobia was also a pretty straight forward aspect of the story. The man is extremely sensitive, and even the slightest touch from a girl causes his blood pressure to soar. Now you canimagine poor Jirou's condition can be a rather frustrating inconvenience, and that led to some pretty funny and warming scenes. Keeping Subaru's secret was also a pretty amusing aspect of the plot, and it led to some pretty funny, and once again heart-warming scenes as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the manner in which they had Jirou and Subaru's relationship progress throughout the anime. As their relationship progressed, so too did the complexity of their character develop, which allowed me to get a feel for both them as individuals, and as a pair. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the supporting characters such as Kanade, Masamune, and Kureha were nicely fleshed out as well, with their own respective back-stories and personalities.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately I did not take a liking to Nakuru. I found her underdeveloped compared to some of the other characters, and her personality was pretty generic, however I can forgive that due to the role she serves in the plot did not necessarily require her to stand out. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: \\n\\n\r\nThere were a number of scenes in this anime that invoked feels and genuine emotion for me. Keep in mind, it was not to the severity of the emotions induced from an anime like Clannad or Toradora, the scenes which did make me tear up or feel for the characters in the were well done and positively contributed to my enjoyment of this short, funny, and sweet anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mayo Chiki focuses on Jiro the protagonist curing his fear of women. Even though Jiro had always hidden his fear for quite sometime he is forced to cure it by Suzusuki. All because of poor Jirou discovering the famed Subaru is actually a girl. The story evolves from the point where Subaru is forced to cure Jiro's phobia. Every time there is romantic moments between Jiro and Subaru there comes an awkward situation causing the comedy moments to appear. Most of the story genre is romance and some comedy here and then, but most of it's romance. The art is done really good especially howthe characters respond to a statement and think wrong and when there is romantic moments. Sound is also done really well with how the characters try to express their emotions and the background sounds to go along with the situations.  Each character has a unique type of personality that is fun to figure out.\\n\\n\r\nJiro - One of the main characters the story focuses on and is the character that struggles to cure his gynophobia. Jiro is the first character introduced in the manga when it begins. He keeps away from girls to make sure he doesn\u2019t pass out from a nosebleed. Once he is forced to be cured by Suzutsuki he suffers from going through a lot of treatments. The thing in Jiro\u2019s character that is interesting to look at is how he responds to Suzutsuki\u2019s treatments and what happens to him just to cure his problem.\\n\r\nSuzutsuki \u2013 Another main character in Mayo Chiki, who tries to cure Jiro of his gynophobia in exchange Jiro has to keep Subaru\u2019s secret. She doesn\u2019t really care what happens to Jirou while he goes through his treatment. She has a mysterious type of personality so you don\u2019t know how she really is like. Her personality is interesting because sometimes she does want to help Jiro, but most of the time she tortures him. \\n\r\nSubaru \u2013 A main character in Mayo Chiki who is discovered to be a girl by Jiro and stays by him to make sure he doesn\u2019t say her secret. She obeys her master command no matter what it is, which makes her a very interesting character. When she is with Jiro she reacts awkwardly to him causing them to be in strange situations. She usually thinks the wrong way to something that isn\u2019t.\\n\r\nOverall this anime deserves a nine because of all the genres and situations it features. Although if you are looking for my comedy and romance then you should check out the manga because it continues with the storyline.",

            "content": "Before I write anything for this anime, I will say something very important. This anime is really fun and enjoyable, no matter who watches it.\r\nPEOPLE WHO WILL (most probably) ENJOY THIS ANIME:\r\nPeople who enjoy light stories, with funny characters, some stupid drama and cute reactions.\r\nPEOPLE WHO WILL NOT (most probably) ENJOY THIS ANIME:\r\nPeople who are bored of typical anime stories and can't stand fan service or ecchi anime.\r\nSo, to kick off the review I will start with the story.\r\nStory (8/10) : The story is pretty original, considering the genre. A girl who dresses like a guy falls in love with a guy that can't staynear girls. Pretty cheesy and cliche, but it suits the style of this anime. It's developement is decent and the end is really cool. So, yeah, pretty much you have a complete story of a typical ecchi/harem/romance anime, but it's really well done, that's why I rate it 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10) : The art is really well done, with smooth animation, unusual for this kind of anime. Not much to say here, because it is not unique, but it's still eye candy (for me at least).\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) : Not much to say for the sound. The voice acting is good, the OST I don't even remember it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10) : Considering the genre the characters develop fairly well.\\n\r\nSakamachi (Main) : He is your typical anime protagonist, with the small detail that he can't stay near women. It's really cool to watch how he creates relationships with some girls and how he learns to adapt. Also, his reaction are really funny.\\n\r\nKonoe (Main) : Cool buttler boy, who proves to be a kawai girl. Really nice developement on this character and I really enjoyed the romance between her and Sakamachi.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters aren't super wow, but they fit the plot like a glove.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) :  I think the anime is really enjoyable, for most people at least. It radiates a good feeling and you can watch it without having to worry about anything. Funny, sad, cute. All these are good for a comedy anime, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10) : I believe that this anime is a great example of new-gen comedy anime. It is fun. it is well done and it is complete. Maybe the ending doesn't fit to everyone, it's still a legit ending. It sure has some flaws here and there, like excessive fan service at some points, but some people enjoy it, some not. Generally, it is an anime I would reccomend to anyone who would like to spend some time to enjoy a nice anime.",

The entire anime, you can tell that the romance is there, but never really goes beyond a few awkward moments and a few kisses, the two never really get together. In the end, I longed for more, and to see where it would go with the two, but they left it up in the air, and with no sign of a second season to possibly wrap things up. As I said, I enjoyed the anime, but the end wasvery lacking and had me wanting more. Kinda like opening your favorite cereal in the morning, only to find that there isn't enough left for a nice bowl of morning cereal.",

That is, after several embarrassing scenes, events, and misunderstandings.\r\nI really liked the artwork, music, and voice-acting here - the artwork had a 'light' and 'happy' feel to it, and the music supplemented that atmosphere. The voice-acting was awesome. It waslively, and realistic. When a character cried - they cried. When someone laughs - they laugh. When someone blushes - they blush. When someone gets hit by a car - they scream.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly - the voice-acting is phenomenal. It really gives life to the whole anime and I loved every part of it.\\n\\n\r\nWhy don't you see for yourself?",

            "content": "Disclaimer: Swearwords will be included in this review. Approach with caution. Spoilers might be included. Professional approach on the subject not included.\r\nOh God, I don't even know where to start this messy clusterfuck of a show.\r\nLong long ago while this show was still airing I've decided to watch it and dropped it several episodes hence. Several years afterwards when I finally got around to checking which animes I have watched, I saw this and thought \"hey this seems good, why haven't I seen this before\" which brings me here.\r\nOh God, where to start. For starters, there are the general actions of the bloody characters. Thecharacters appear to walking three years old with the body of teenagers. They accept commands simply because and their idea of common sense are basically not there. Things like \"I am doing sexual petting to cure MC's gynophobia\"(which by the way, his ailment is not. A phobia is an irrational fear and our mc does not suffer fear from women, irrational or not) is straightforward stupid. It is bad enough when the butler does this because she is ordered to but when everyone else does is not reasonable in any way, ailments be damned. That stuff is something you do with a boyfriend, husband, whatever, not someone you just met some days ago and shit!\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the harem situation. For most harem titles the heroines will flock to the mc because of coincidence, fate stuff because here. But in here the heroines get to fall for the mc because of the dumbest reasons. The first one, being the butler falls under the category of the basic harem coincidence and goes onward from there but the others include:\\n\r\n\"I will use mc to make someone I like jealous yet I don't know that the person I like is actually a girl and somehow I fell in love with the mc in this scenario\".\\n\r\nWhile the other is \"I will pair the mc with someone else 'cause they totally look good together but I want to tease mr mc as well because reasons. But wait! Somehow I've managed to fall in love with him as well and now I'm stuck with having to mediate for this two people while here I am, in love with the other person because of my own machinations, oops\".\\n\r\nNow doesn't that sound stupid. Well yes it is.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the scenarios that they get into. Why the hell would you think that the best cure for someone with fear of knives is do a pretend kidnapping? Oh, and lets throw in a knife wielding kidnapper in that scenario as well. On what universe does that seem to be the best answer to curing someone? Then there's the forgetting my only sibling's birthday and the I made my butler lose her job because I don't look where I walk yet I somehow magically swerved to go down the stairs. Well this is a comedy but come on, at least give your characters a brain at least.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good thing about this series is the art, which I will admit is pretty good, and the fanservice, if you look at shows just for them. I mean they made basically hentai screenshots in a non-hentai anime, so there's that.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly this whole show is just plain fanservice pandering and stupid scenarios. It was a really painful drag to finish this show and I'm wondering how I finished it when I have dropped more interesting stuff.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nEverybody has a weakness. This may be physically or psychologically. For some people, they try to cure this weakness to make themselves a stronger person. In Mayo Chiki, Jirou tries to do just this with the aide of the lady butler Subaru and her mistress Kanade. What we are left with is a fun show without much substance.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story revolves around Jirou, a high school boy who has the worst case of gynophobia (fear of women) ever. One day at school, he discovers the secret of Subaru the boy butler -- he is actually a she in disguise.In order to keep this a secret, Subaru and her mistress Kanade decide to help him overcome his weakness.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the show is very sexual in its content, more so than I knew going in. Almost every joke and situation has sexual connotations attached to them. Meaning, the show is probably best for an older audience.\\n\r\nThat being said, I thought the comedy was fun. Many of the gags repeat themselves more than once over the course of the show, but I always found myself laughing at them.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the comedy, romance is also a major part. I found the romance elements to be fine for what they were. It is gradual but ends on an unsatisfying note. This is because not only is the show left completely open-ended, but the final episode of the show does not continue at all from where the second-to-last one left off. Meaning, the actual ending for the anime adaptation is really bad. This is unfortunate, but something that appears to have been unavoidable.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the story elements, they were oddly placed in. Many things that are introduced are either immediately resolved or touched on for an episode and pretty much forgotten. Off of the top of my head, this includes things such as Subaru's weakness and Jirou's father. With this in mind, the writing for the plot itself can be described as bad.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe shows art is fine for its time period. Nothing flashy but nothing bad either. It is just another generic looking anime.\\n\r\nThe character designs are fine as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation was, again, fine. They don't go out of their way to showcase their skills, but the character movements and some of the fighting scenes were animated satisfactorily.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I actually enjoyed Jirou (the MC), Subaru (the female lead/butler), and Kanade (butler's mistress).\\n\\n\r\nJirou was interesting mainly due to his gynophobia and general awareness. He wasn't a dumb MC by any means, and his phobia allowed for some interesting scenarios. I wish they would have explored his character a bit more than they did, but for this type of show, I guess what I got should have been expected.\\n\\n\r\nThe same goes for Subaru. Being a girl dressed/perceived as a boy is unique in a lot of ways. This allowed for funny characterization and enjoyable misunderstandings. Again, small character development is present but not enough to truly care about the character.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, with Kanade, I mainly found her to my liking because she was the smartest. That is to say, she moved all of the events along mainly due to her families power. Plus, because she is very confident in herself throughout all of the show, she pretty much dictates how the characters will act or go about their business. She provides a sense of direction that was probably needed for the show itself. Besides that, I enjoyed her character a lot, simply because she had no qualms with constantly teasing everybody to no end.\\n\\n\r\nMy gripe with them is that this is mainly it. They have their schtick and they stick with it for the entirety of the show. Granted, they wouldn't be the characters they are without them, but I would have liked to have seen some growth in one way or another out of any of them.\\n\\n\r\nBesides these three, I found the other minor characters to be fine with the exceptions of Nakuru (the glasses loving girl) and Nagare (Subaru's father). Those two were pretty annoying and I kind of hated their characters.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the OP and ED are too generic. In other words, they are not good. Forgetful and non-catchy is not a good mix.\\n\\n\r\nI will say, one of the pieces of comedy that the show liked to use was the \"music drop\". Meaning, when sappy music is playing only to suddenly cut short for comedic effect. Surprisingly, this worked on me almost every time. Perhaps it is just easy to get a laugh out of me, but I liked the way in which they \"music dropped\" almost every single episode.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, I thought everyone was appropriate in their roles, with no outstanding performances.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI actually really liked this anime. I found myself laughing all the time, even if many of the sexual jokes were reused over and over. I would always found myself smiling when Kanade was teasing Jirou to no end or when Kureha was fawning over Subaru. The comedy it presented was nicely done and made me grin like a fool.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to romance, I am a bit biased in that I love it to death. That being said, I loved the romance elements. I liked how shy Subaru would get around Jirou or how Usami played a nice tsundere character. It's not the best romance in anime, but it serves its purpose nicely enough.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, all over the place with shoddy ending\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, serves its purpose\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, start unique but fall flat\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, OP and ED are no good but OST is somewhat good in context\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, lots of laughs and nice romance aspects\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "I've already watched some animes where we can find a girl dressing like a boy, as a disguise (Ikusu, from NakaImo!) or under a traditional father's command, but this was my first time seeing a main female character like that. Can't say it's something never saw before, obviously... Still, a great choice!\r\n{STORY - 7/10}\r\nIt all begins with the relationship between Konoe Subaru and Kanade Suzutsuki. Konoe, belonging to a butlers lineage, that swore serving Kanade's one, promised being the one who'd call her as a master. However, the fact that she's the first girl born on her family and also the only sucessor would keepKonoe from fulfilling her biggest dream...\\n\\n\r\nUnder the deal of acting like a boy, without rasing any suspicion during High School, made from Konoe, a real butler. Everything doing just fine, until Kinjirou Sakamachi accidentally discovers her secret...\\n\\n\r\nJust like on any other similar stories, Konoe slowly starts developing feelings for Kinjirou. Unable to live like a girl on her ealier years prevented Konoe from making friends aside Kanade. Kinjirou becomes more than just an accomplice on this act... He worries about Konoe and wants her to be happy... That's so heartwarming...\\n\\n\r\n{ART - 8/10}\\n\\n\r\nWhat impressed more about it was the animation. Eventhough action scenes aren't the focus in here, fighting moves were very well done and are full of those cool \"air explosions\".\\n\\n\r\nAbout the overall style, it has nothing too special. Mostly simple, not overloaded with useless features and with a nice eye design. Some clothes are rather uncommon (Kanade's dress, for example) and those are the ones which called most of my attention.\\n\\n\r\n{SOUND - 6/10}\\n\\n\r\n\"BE STARTERS!\", performed by Eri Kitamura as the OP song reflects well the main thematic, as it tells about initiative related to love. \"Kimi ni Gohoushi\", performed at the ending, by Yuka Iguchi, features a slower, more calm rhythm.\\n\\n\r\nWhen related to music, the backgrounding was nothing excepcional... Effects for climax situations fit nicely and voice acting had the participation from Kana Hanazawa, as Kureha. I can't deny loving her voice...\\n\\n\r\n{CHARACTER - 7/10}\\n\\n\r\nThe main reason for me to watch this one was Konoe, but Mayo Chiki! has a good share of main characters, featuring distinct personalities and appearance. \\n\\n\r\nKonoe, at first cold, gets her heart softened by having Kinjirou on her side. Having both incredible strength and speed, including a lot of skills on melee, are her best means to protect Kanade.\\n\\n\r\nBeing the only male son from a professional female wrestler has made from Kinjirou the perfect punching bag for his mother. All the pain and humilliation cause by both her and Kureha, his little sister, resulted on some kind of \"allergy to women\", which makes him bleed from his nose and faint everytime a girl gets too close.\\n\\n\r\nKanade comes from a rich family and looks all cute from the outside, hiding a menacing sadistic attitude on the inside. Usami appears as someone who deeply falls in love for Kinjirou, despite having trouble on showint what she really feels...\\n\\n\r\n{ENJOYMENT - 10/10}\\n\\n\r\nIt was just like as I expected! I love this kind of anime so of course Mayo Chiki! pleased me a lot. Kinjirou being forced to fear girls is somewhat original and the way he was capable of hugging Konoe without bleeding is a beautiful proof of true love...\\n\\n\r\n{OVERALL - 8/10}\\n\\n\r\nKonoe's secret shouldn't, at all costs, be revealled, and Kinjirou wants to cure his gynophobia. A deal proposed by Kanade would benefit both sides and entertain her in the meanwhile... Jirou and Konoe will suddenly get know what it's to be with someone you love and, soon enough, she will be able to show her sweet and caring personality, as Konoe acts as a girl after a long time...",

Mayo Chiki is based on a light novel so it is a no surprise that the anime adaption is not complete and ends without a definite conclusion. By going through the synopsis, you probably know the premise, so I am not going to bother with that. \r\nFirst of all, cross dressing characters in an anime series is nothing new, but few anime do this as skillfully as Mayo Chiki. It gives away with cookie cutter characters and provides a genuine character development. What I said about the characters is true for all except themain. No he is not all clich\u00e9d and stereotypical jerk but possesses some unique traits. The character of Kanade or Ojou Sama is a masterfully crafted as it can be, the sinister plots that she puts up really increase the enjoyment level notably.\\n\r\nThe problem arises because the anime is not complete, it does not fully develop all its cast so most of the things are left unsaid and underdeveloped. \\n\r\nLastly, for a final verdict, I would definitely recommend this anime because it tries to do things differently although slightly slipping into the Harem territory which is also rudimentary. But still providing a fair share of laughs and giggles while also entangling us in a sweet romance. As for me I really loved Konohe Subaru, she was the best character in my opinion.\\n\r\nBut I highly recommend to pick up the manga, it is completed and provides with a definite and sweet ending, might I add unexpected!\\n\\n\r\nFor Anime - 8/10\\n\r\nFor Manga 9/10\\n\\n\r\nLight novel is not all translated, if you can get a hold of it definitely read it!\\n",

The story keeps me watching. It's simple on paper yet the anime draws out its full potential. There is a substantial amount of ecchi, even some nudity   ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) but they're so ridiculous half the time you can't not laugh. (The glasses scene-yeah if you've watched this then you know what I'm talking about). This is definitely something I would recommend to someone, especially if they're in the mood for comedy. I think Konoe'scharacter in particular was done beautifully. We see that harsh dynamic between when she's acting like a butler and when she's acting like a real girl. I really appreciate the duality.",

            "content": "Story\r\nWithin just the first episode, MayoChiki makes enticing promises about what the core of the show could actually be. It had me considering any and all of the following possibilities right then and there:\r\n1. ....would it be about the struggle to overcome one's fears? \r\n2. ....would it be about how far people will go to help their friends?\r\n3. ....would it be about finding true love?\r\n4. ....would it be about discovering one's own sexuality?\r\n5. ....or would it merely be about some whacky characters in even whackier situations, with lots of fan service and comic misunderstandings thrown in? \r\nSadly, although the writer (or writers?) really seemed towant to go in the more \"serious\" directions 1-4 above, they seemed to be on some sort of leash that would always pull them back to direction 5, never allowing them to truly explore any of the more worthwhile directions. (Not that fan service can't be entertaining in its own right, but after so many tantalizing steps in much more intriguing directions, it ended up feeling rather unsatisfying. To me, at least.)\\n\\n\r\nThe plot suggests that it revolves around underage butler Konoe, since all the female characters gravitate towards her and then all hug her during the OP. But strangely, the person telling the story is Jirou, a high school boy who is introduced as being very annoyed with Konoe, who he believes is a much more masculine guy than he is. Yes, you read it right: almost everyone believes that Konoe is a guy, in spite of his long tresses!\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Jirou finds out about Konoe's secret when he stumbles into a toilet booth where Konoe was just relieving herself. (Doesn't ANYONE lock toilet booths or bathrooms in anime?!?) The necessary antics ensue, and Jirou soon finds himself promising Konoe that he won't reveal her secret. because that would cost her her job as butler. And being a butler is everything she he has worked for her whole life. Even when this makes Jirou look even more like a homosexual than he already does to his classmates. And to his own younger sister who already is more masculine than him, because she uses him as a vicitm for her martial arts' practice every morning. \\n\\n\r\nJirou's self-sacrificing nature really shines through here, since not many people would go that far just to help someone they only just met. Let alone a tom-boy butler who wasn't all that nice to him to begin with.  This seemed like the kind of set-up that could well have led to a nice romantic entanglement, I thought. The most important obstacle seemed to be Jirou's fear of women (the medical term slips my mind), which causes him to get nosebleeds whenever a woman touches him. An obvious comedy device, to be sure, but the backstory about him having both a dominating mother and sister who were both martial arts experts, sounded somewhat interesting. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then things get even more interesting, as Konoe's mistress Suzutski also chimes in. Although she likes to pretend that her interests are mostly of the sadistic kind, and she does like to play the occasional trick on both Jiroe and Konoe, many of her plans do seem to be intended to subtly help the both of them to make progress towards... Well, what? Romance, friendship, overcoming one's own traumas? \\n\\n\r\nAt some point, it is revealed that Konoe lost her mother at quite a young age and Jirou emotionally supports her on the anniversary of her mother's death when Konoe visits her family grave. Pretty powerful stuff, I felt. \\n\\n\r\nBut then, somewhere around episode 9, this anime simply seems to give up on the more serious themes of the show and it rattles off some lighter episodes. (Although the one about Jirou's martial arts sister feeling sad because Jirou forgot her previous birthday again seemed to hint at this series trying to dig deeper than just the fan service clich\u00e9s). \\n\\n\r\nAnd sadly, the show decides to leave most of the story threads it pulled loose dangling and ends it all on a gag episode about a BL-fanatic classmate  being worried that nobody would like her for anything more than her breasts.  Again, even this plot element had some hints of wanting to be less shallow, as though the writers kept resisting the urge to go 100% mindless fan service to the very end. And, almost as an aside, Jirou does seem to overcome his fear of women by helping this female BL-fanatic over her own fear. But exactly why this happened with someone he had no feelings for remains a little obscure. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nCertainly not bad, but some of the character models seemed eerily similar to some used in other shows. Konoe looks (and acts) a lot like Kirinoe from \"Ore No Imouto\"(released a year previously), while Lady Suzutski has almost the same face as Menma from Anohana. Some minor characters (redhead Masumane whom I hadn't mentioned before) and the big-breasted BL-fanatic  in turn seem to have been copied for use in the (more recent) \"The Hentai Prince and the Stony Cat\". I haven't checked if any of those other shows were made by the same studios, but it sure wouldn't surprise me. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe OP en ED are not at all bad. And the first one was sung by Eri Kitamura, no less. Impressive. Of the voice actors and actresses, the one portraying Konoe (Yuka Iguchi) does the most striking job, I felt. Not only does she manage both her feminine and more masculine voice quite convincingly, she also infuses Konoe's words with real feeling. Hanazawa Kana surprisingly portrays the rather butch younger sister character Kureha who often beats up her older brother. And Eri Kitamura does a very good job of voicing the elitist Suzutsuki. The guy portraying Jirou did all right and portrayed all the right emotions, although he seemed to have fewer challenging lines then his female colleagues. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nWell, as touched upon under \"Story\", the dropping of all of this story's more serious plotlines leaves the viewer guessing which character has progressed how far in which direction. Sure, Jirou seems to get over his fear of women and Konoe gains a new appreciation of what it means to be a butler, but that seems to be about it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIn spite of this show's shortcomings, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. The characters were interesting, many of the comic plot twists felt fresh, the animation and backgrounds were nice to look at, while the voice acting was quite good. All in all, this show made Konoe into an intriguing female butler who is both strong and sensitive. Definitely a memorable and possibly even a classic anime character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nA show that was apparently never meant to be anything more than a fun fan service romcom somehow continually tried to rise above its premise, only to get pulled right back down to it time and again. Really quite curious, but definitely interesting. Still, I can't help but feel that viewers looking for a \"fan service\" experience will come away from this feeling a little short-changed. And folks that got hooked on the romance angle will also be left feeling unsatisfied. Perhaps the moral of the story is that shows like \"To LoveRu\" and \"Kimi ni Todoke\" really shouldn't be mixed together this way, but should instead stay in their own respective niches?",

            "content": "Mayo Chiki! is the story of boobs\u2026I mean a love story intricately crafted around a unique premise. I mean a bare bones romance/drama/comedy about a guy butler who is actually a girl and has romantic time with the guy who discovered she was a girl.\r\nBased on a light novel series (which should be a given for any anime I\u2019ve reviewed lately), Mayo Chiki! is not as bare bones as I previously stated, but doesn\u2019t innovate in any way. It\u2019s a very likeable anime that isn\u2019t bogged down by anything but its sheer use of cliches.\r\nStory\r\nMayo Chiki! is the story of a girl named Konoe Subaru.She is a butler, but as a butler she must pretend to be a man due to some sort of familial something-or-other. Her mistress is amazingly rich because her father is the head of the schools, which apparently pays well enough in Japan to allow them to own a mansion, two butlers, two maids, a limousine, and a private hospital. On top of this, the mistress doesn\u2019t have to wear a school uniform because she\u2019s too rich and good for that. Then again, Konoe the butler guy/girl gets to wear her butler clothes around school as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Jirou, a typical high school boy with gynaphobia (I\u2019m sure you can figure out what this means on your own) enters the stall with Konoe in it (she has to use the mens\u2019 room as she is pretending to be a guy) and he sees her cute panties. Thinking her to be a perverted male, there\u2019s a fight and before we know it, with just a simple shove, her butler shirt unbuttons and Jirou is groping her breasts.\\n\\n\r\nSo now he must protect her secret that she is a female and he ends up going on crazy misadventures with her and her mistress. The mistress and Konoe seem to be falling for him, and they both try to cure his gynaphobia.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is an original premise, it enters the obligatory anime romance/drama cliches:\\n\r\n-Pool episode\\n\r\n-Beach episode\\n\r\n-Hot spring episode\\n\r\n-Festival episode\\n\r\n-Bath scene\\n\\n\r\nAnd we all know what this means! FAN SERVICE! And while it doesn\u2019t really hit panty territory (we see them off the girl a couple times and on the girl once) it provides gratuitous breastage and lots of thighs. These episodes in no way innovate upon the basic formula that we\u2019ve come to expect of episodes such as these, but they are funny and don\u2019t come across as totally cliche.\\n\\n\r\nSo most of the story revolves around the romance between Jirou and Konoe, and it does focus on some other characters who they become friends with along the way. Meanwhile, the whole school thinks Jirou is gay with Subaru since nobody has yet to figure out he\u2019s a she.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot never exactly does anything totally exciting, it just provides the basic skeletal outline for a decent romance/comedy. Nonetheless, it does it well enough that you keep watching it and want to see what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThe animation is good. Characters look good and cute and all that. Backgrounds look nice. The ambiance of the show is very bright most of the time, a lot of bright colors really helping make the show easy on the eyes. The animation is also smooth. It\u2019s not really, really fantastic animation, but it is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nA theme song that is good. An ending song that is meh. Music in the middle that is okay. The characters voice actors are all good and once again, I don\u2019t have a lot to really talk about in this section.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThis is where I really find my personal tastes being at odds with my critic tastes. Konoe is awesome, says one side of me. The other side tells me that she\u2019s good, but not that great. They are combating each other and I think I\u2019m going to choose my personal tastes over that of my critic. I loved Konoe. She wasn\u2019t the most emotionally riveting character, not in the slightest, but she was a good character who was different from most anime girls. She was likeable in her want to protect and serve her mistress as a boy, but also likeable as a girl who really had no friends and met Jirou and was falling for him. The romance between the two is compelling because of this strange scenario and is the only reason it really works.\\n\\n\r\nJirou himself, as our main protagonist, is merely okay. His gynaphobia is funny and he certainly is entertaining, but he\u2019s cookie cutter minus the gynaphobia. His sister is the same, cookie cutter and not really compelling. There is a typical tsundere girl who rides on a moped and isn\u2019t all that exciting.\\n\\n\r\nBut the mistress is also a good character. While at first she seems like a bad guy with ill intentions, she slowly grows on you and you see that she truly is a good guy. I personally feel she had some romantic ideas about Jirou, but the series doesn\u2019t really pass beyond the stage where characters admit to each other. It\u2019s all implied.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nMayo Chiki! is entertaining and provides two cool characters, but is an otherwise fairly basic specimen. One thing I noticed is two instances where it had some promotion for Aria the Scarlet Ammo seemingly. There is a poster in the background of one episode, and one character dresses as Aria. I guess the same studio did these two anime? The animation is somewhat similar. It also brings up a great comparison:\\n\\n\r\nThere are anime out there that are not good story-wise or character-wise but are nonetheless really fun to watch. As a critic, I am usually thought of as that guy who reviews based on how good everything is. If everything is excellent, then it gets a ten, but when there are a lot of inadequate things, it gets something less than five.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not true with me. I do base my scores on how good the story, animation, sound, and characters are, but I also base it on something I can\u2019t explain in paragraph form under a header: entertainment value.\\n\\n\r\nNow let me explain that comparison I\u2019ve been getting at:\\n\\n\r\nMayo Chiki!, just like Aria, has a lot of faults, but it is entertaining. That\u2019s the bottom line.\\n",

Well not exactly the plot because the plot of this is you know... the usual situations and hurdles of an ecchi-harem anime. What I'm trying to point out was thestory line. The story is rather unique and has a bit of a dramatic element though not that brutal unlike the ones that focus on pure drama but enough to give a bit of a feel to the audience. However, with the comedy content in this one, it's enough to make you burst out laughing until you shed a tear or roll on the floor. (Well, I might be exaggerating and some scenes may be funny but not really that much for me because I'm used to watching hardcore comedy). The main characters maybe a bit different from our usual harem heroes and heroines but not that really far from them. You might get attached to some and make some ships but I kinda think that the development of each character wasn't really elaborated. Though there is progression, it seems a bit rushed. The artstyle is decent as well and thankfully there were no misdrawn scenes that might raise complaints. Though I didn't binge this series in a day, I was able to enjoy it and it gave what I was looking for. I gave this a rating of 9 because there were some parts that didn't really satisfy me and there were some issues that I can't really figure out. This anime is underrated and hopefully the studio can make some bonuses for this series. \\n\\n\r\nMayo Chiki! can be a bit cliche with its genres but I do recommend that you give this a shot because no matter how you may see it, you might find something that you can enjoy about it.",

So if you ever plan on watching this series, be sure to be prepared to be able to tolerate cliche moments that just aren't surprising and comes out as bland (5 out of a scale of 10).\r\nMayo Chiki! focuses on a high school-aged boy that has this certain condition with women. It's like he has the girl version of being lactose intolerant (I'm not directly gonna tell it because that would be a mild spoiler).\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFirstly, if I had to say something about thestory, and I had to describe it with one word, it would be \"common\". It's basically an ecchi-harem story like any other ecchi-harem stories you've ever seen or watched. The art is very pretty. I absolutely adore characters with the usual very anime-ish style; this is especially since the characters are quite bland and cliche, the only things that gets them going is the art and animation (points for the ojou-sama character; also, points for the moe and gap moe characters).\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was not that satisfying in my opinion. That may be a bit biased due to the fact that I liked the other heroine (the ojou-sama character) better than the main heroine.\\n\\n\r\nStill, even with all these qualms, Mayo Chiki! is still worth spending your time on.\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: 7 out of 10",

I really enjoyed this anime. It has me cracking up at time but sometimes sad. I only have one grip with this anime, the ending. It does not solve anything but instead kinda gives you a hint to a second season.(Also there is talk of a second season coming soon.) That is my only grip, now on to the real review.\r\nStory:9 A great story but in the end does not wrap up quite well.\r\nArt:9A colorful palate for an anime. But nothing too special. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:9 The art suits the voices perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9 Very good variety of characters, but some are not explained all that well.(Also the 13 episode is more of a ova of a character i really did not care to much for. So consider the first 12 episodes as the actual anime.) \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:9 This anime was very fun to watch. I would recommend this to anyone. Just be carful for a bit of a let down at the end.",

            "content": "One of the first harems that was added to my list and i must say it definitely was a good starting point.\r\nHere's the show in a nutshell: guy with gynophobia meets a handsome butler who turns out to be a super cute girl, guy learns something he wasn't supposed to and is sworn to secrecy or else he will face death, guy has to take part in training in which he has to be intimate with women in order to cure his gynophobi, stuff happens in between and the guy ends up loving girl, and that is the lovely story of Mayo Chiki! Now thereason i wrote this really long one sentence description of Mayo Chiki was to show that, even though it sways in the direction of a harem the story is very unique and isn't a cliche harem\\n\\n\r\nThe first episodes of this series were geared t the  romance, and then it moved away from that and became kinda ridiculous in the middle, then before you realize it, the series returns to  Romance. Fan service also seemed to be more frequent during the middle (I can\u2019t think of any reason other than they are trying to fill the episodes). In a way the middle episodes were almost like fillers.\\n\\n\r\nEverything received 8's ( Story, Art, Sound, Characters, Enjoyment, and Overall)\\n\r\nthe story was unique and entertaining its humor was uncompromising and unrelenting.The relationship between the two characters, Kinjirou and Subaru, develops at a nice pace in the first third of the show. Subaru was bold in approaching Kinjirou, which is nice to see, instead of the slow moving pace that other Romantic comedies usually have.\\n\\n\r\nI have to talk about one thing - i was very, very, very disappointed with the ending of Mayo Chiki!  All problems are suddenly resolved and Subaru and Kinjirou decide that they magically love each other during the show\u2019s closing episode. with a show that had so much potential, it actually mad me sad that the show finished with such an ending. Other than that i was really happy with the show as a whole and would recommend it to anyone ^_^",

            "content": "So here we have a  Typical Rom Com anime. You have you basic character types, a twist within the premise and a small hook to get you to try to look forward to a chance of a season two\r\nJust like any other Rom Com you have the male and female protagonist who are also followed by a supporting main character who like to tease the main protagonists.\r\nThe storyline is alright and it was leading to a nice path but too bad they just ended wrong. Where in the opening you see Subaru running around the place, frantically looking for someone, which lead me toa conclusion that in the last episode, something is going to happen to Jiro and things are going to get interesting. Too bad that wasn't the case. I'm pretty sure that somewhere along that line were two paths: One leading to my conclusion and the other is the conclusion the producers came up. That's because the author hasn't written a ending yet so the producers thought of this half-hearted ending for us viewers. What a great way to end with the final scene of subaru all dressed up thanking Jiro. I personally think the last episode is a ova but they included as one of the episode. Probably trying to tell us a message saying that there might be a season two, but don't get your hopes up to high. \\n\\n\r\nHonesty this anime is too similar to other Rom Com like Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu, except this time its about the butler not the princess herself. \\n\r\nBoth anime is about a guy finds out about a idol's secret and promises to keep it. anime shows the adventure of their daily live from that point on.\\n\r\nReally it is pretty hard to rate a harem genre, since there is no standards to base it on. Liike some producers show you too much, some too less or show you some parts but not the ones your looking for and also like this one, just enough to make you continue.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is quite nice actually. The cuteness in the characters appearance really make this anime quite enjoyable to watch although the ending is a disappointment causing the viewers to think what was the whole point in this story??This style of art is very high quality animationstyle, it is very detailed and has smooth animations, as well as the creative character design is very appealing with their cute eyes which stands out  a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.. give it a shot! The artworks is nice and the anime is one of the  Classic Romantic Comedy where there's no point in the whole thing but its fun to watch the characters interact and see how the story progress. But let me lead you off with one thing: The ending may not be the best but i personally think episode 12 is the ending and they ended on a fine note.\\n\\n\r\nCiao for now~\\n",

Kinjirou becomes her first friend and crush so she tries to protect their friendship at all costs but at the same time wanting her relationship with him to go beyond friends. \\n\\n\r\n                  Konoe greatly resembles Koaru(Ladies Versus Butlers) and Chalotte(Infinite Stratos). these kind of character tend to have a double personality due to the fact being forced to cross dress. they show a poised,cool figure to the people other than the one who knows their secret.\\n\\n\r\n                   Another interesting character is Kanade, a yandere character is a perfect contrast for a gynephobic person. She uses Kinjirou to return her relationship with Konoe to what it originally was. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:  \\n\r\n                 i'd only give it a 6/10. it's disappointing to see such a good story that could've been way better gone to waste. it's like good coffee with no sugar in it. -.-",

To be honest, the ending is just a bit disappointing and didn't satisfy me at all, though I'm not sad about it. On the website I watched this on, it didn't label it as ecchi or harem, just a rom-com, so boy was I in for a ride xD Luckily, I'm a guy, so I'm not complaining I guess. Lots of fan service too, surprising amount, but can't do much about it. I really wanted a good ending too, sigh.. I had high hopes coming in, but the authors really had no ideawhat direction this anime was going in, whether it was a harem or rom-com with just one heroine because it eventually became both and it annoyed the hell out of me -_-",

So I'll stop wasting time and do what I came here for.\r\nSTORY - 6\r\nI'd say this is the part of the anime that wasn't my favorite, the story really had no explanation, and what really pushes my buttons is the last episode. The actual drama basically ended at episode 12 and episode 13 was, what do they call it, a filler? Yea, one of those, which wouldhave been perfectly fine in the middle of the series where it belongs, but at the end? There must have been some kind of mistake. But anyways, the story was really simple, I'd summarize it: cute crossdressing butler ecchi with many clich\u00e9s and \"fillers,\" but still kept me hooked. Similar to your average romcom anime, pretty much.\\n\\n\r\nART - 9 \\n\r\nI absolutely loved the art style, I think it was the eyes that got me. I also fell in love with the character design, everyone just looked so attractive regardless of gender.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 10\\n\r\nThe seiyuus were perfect for the roles, the OP and ED are fantastic as well and fit the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 9\\n\r\nVery simple archetypes, but I fell in love with Subaru, so we get a point here.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 9 \\n\r\nNot much to say here, it was super entertaining and funny, had some ecchi but wasn't over the top or unneeded, had drama, romance, the clich\u00e9s that we love, pretty much my ideal harem/ecchi (I haven't watched much that I enjoyed but I'm sure this is what I was looking for).\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 8\\n\r\nI'd say, for this type of anime, this one was great. Well done, Studio feel.",

            "content": "The show mostly take place in a High School where the main hero, Sakamachi Kinjirou, attends. Konoe Subaru, the famous butler of Kanade Suzutsuki, is peeing at the man's toilet when Kinjirou accidentally opens the door and reveals the butler secret. This well-known butler who's idolized by women at the school is actually a girl! By revealing her truth, Kinjirou is being dragged into the situation where he needs to cooperate with Subaru and Kanade Suzutsuki\u2014the only daughter of principal, after face the butler in a wrong time and wrong place (toilet).\r\n    This circumstances lead them to continuously meet one another. Thegynophobia guy\u2014always got nosebleeding by the touch of a girl, the famous (woman) butler, the troublesome sadistic Ojou-sama, and not to mention also other characters to liven up the show.\\n\\n\r\n    The show is a continually school life - slice-of-Iife story, spiced up with romantic comedy, it's undeniably fun. The difference between this one and the rest are every characters have their own one or two lil secrets. Those secrets are tied up with the main characters here, Kinjirou, Subaru-san, and Ojou-sama. You will find the story of them together is absolutely delightful \u0669( \u275b \u25bf \u275b)\u06f6  The supporting aspect is the art, I like the colour I feel it kinda relaxing, because it's not an action or supernatural genres so the movements or effects are not the core but still it's soft and pretty built.\\n\\n\r\n    The scope of every characters involvement in several moments make a good development. While we are spoiled by the jokes, we can observe bit by bit their improvements, their roles which filled this rom com series. It's not too rush and not too slow either, slowly but sure the goal of Ojou-sama with the help of her butler to cure the Kinjirou's gynophobia will be the hint for the story to keep moving. Other characters too, are nice I love them in an instant. I truly set my eyes on Kinjirou and Subaru relationship, in the anime series, these two experience feeling of love and caring but vaguely appears, and everytime it appears I think that I could eat them up \u2044(\u2044 \u2044\u2022\u2044\u03c9\u2044\u2022\u2044 \u2044)\u2044 \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n    Well, for music, both OP and ED theme are nice. Nothing special yet it's good and sometimes I put it on my playlist to listen. OP theme is sung by Eri Kitamura, \"Be Starters!\" and the ED theme are sung by Yuka Iguchi, Mariya Ise, & Eri Kitamura \"Kimi ni Gohoushi (\u541b\u306b\u3054\u5949\u4ed5)\". I also listen to the character songs which are so good for me, and I recommend it to you.\\n\\n\\n\r\n    I think we can draw out the meaning of its story about accept others no matter what kind of person they are, the healthy yet nerd one, the normal with a weird illness, whoever it is and try to strengthen relationship even if it's started with first bad meeting lol I give 8.5 overall.\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\nThe mild story and likeable characters, so enjoyable\\n\r\nNot too romantic but yeah it is, with nice jokes\\n\r\nNice theme songs and character songs\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nI think the series could give us more but it hadn't\\n\\n",

The cross dressing butler is a unique thread, but not uncommon.  This one was executed well, but with the weak ending that almost all harem anime have.  There is also an unnecessary 13th episode which is more of a side story.\r\nThe show hits all the tropes: hot springs, maid cafe, fireworks, etc.  You will be frustrated at times with the strict adherence to the usual harem formula, but the characters are good enough to keep you watching.This is not a great anime, but enjoyable enough to spend an afernoon on.",

            "content": "To be completely honest, an ecchi harem anime with a plot centered on a boy trying to get rid of his gynophobia sounds incredibly raunchy. While the show was at times peppered with some moments that were obviously set aside for fan service, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoyed watching the rest of it. Of course almost all the girls have a thing for Jinjirou-kun sooner or later, as custom to the harem genre. However, each girl had her own insecurities unique from the others, and as Jinjirou became involved with them, he began to learn more about them and help themin his own way.\\n\\n\r\nNow then, the range of different girls (all with varying hair colors, of course) adds to the anime's many themes. It feels a little ridiculous reading the synopsis and seeing how strange the cast of characters is: an aspiring pro-wrestler, the confident daughter of a noble, a cross-dressing butler, a fervent author of yaoi, a stubborn girl who lives with ghosts. I can't say that all of them had problems that touched my heart, though. Sometimes the comedy infused in the show kept these complications from really identifying with the viewer, and I didn't take them seriously. Others were closer to making me sympathize with the girl in question, but then again, how seriously can you take a show like this?\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, I did like the characters. Some of them seemed annoying at first, but they became cute later, and the main character Jinjirou-kun, was very likable. He isn't the classic pervert because he himself tries to avoid girls due to his condition. But of course, he can't stop the inevitable, as girls are everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nI was also quite satisfied with the romantic aspects of the show. For the girls that were most interested in Jinjirou-kun, I could clearly see why they were. A lot of harems have a problem in showing this, but in the span of 13 episodes, I think it was done well. Jinjirou is himself and despite avoiding girls a lot, he can talk to them normally and care about them. He's a sweet older brother and this shows in his interactions with others. While there wasn't a good romantic conclusion to this series, I think if it were longer there would have been.\\n\\n\r\nI very much liked the animation in this show. Everyone's eyes were brightly colored and the fight scenes (which there actually were a lot of, unexpectedly) were animated in such a way that it was easy to understand what was going on, who threw what punch or kick, etc. I'm not so much a fan of shiny pink shoulders and boobs as they're unrealistic, those were there, too, if you like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was surprisingly good. I adored the opening song. While it starts out kind of cute, the lyrics and cut scenes make it seem a tad bit more serious than the anime is, but I still liked it a lot. Other moments of the anime had good matching pieces for silly moments and likewise for sad ones, some of which were very cheery or pretty. \\n\\n\r\nDespite some of the odd perverted circumstances Jinjirou-kun got into (most of which were in the first episode), I liked watching this anime a lot. I usually shy away from ecchi stuff and harem things, but someone convinced me to try this and I'm glad I did. It had me laughing a few times and I liked the way Jinjirou-kun was able to connect with the other characters. I always spent a few extra moments listening to the opening theme and even watched this anime in two-episode bursts. While I wouldn't recommend this to everyone because of some naked scenes, it was definitely entertaining to watch regardless.",

It pissed me off to have to watch 19 minutes of a boring story to catch the little moment of fun.  \r\nBut it clearly doesn\u2019t match neither to (typically) a girl who wants to see a great love story, sincethere still is a couple of pervert scenes and some ecchi. So after watching Mayo chiki, I\u2019m still wondering who was the public who was targeted.  If you\u2019re going to give a try, just watch the three or four first episodes : if you like it you can go ahead, but if you feel it\u2019s too boring you can stop since it\u2019s almost the same rythm all along.\\n",

The characters are verrrry enjoyable and the anime itself is a great one with lots of new content and it will make you want to finish the whole series in one go. However there are some aspects of Mayo Chiki that seem lacking. For instance, Mayo Chiki is a harem and the watcher can tell which girl the main character is going to gofor, as usual it is very explicit and is easy to tell. However throughout the 13 episodes that this anime consists of, there is no clear choice that the main character makes and the last episode feels more like an OVA and the story just cuts off at a really awkward phase. The fact that there is no other OVA to end the storyline or even a second season makes this anime lose alot of the appeal that it had. Honestly if this anime was announced to having a second season or a finishing OVA, then many fans of this anime would be ecstatic that this anime gets a clean and clear finish and would be able to see what everyone wants to see.... Who the main character picks.",

This anime has ALOT of tsundere moments, and its very cliche. The thing that I dont like about this anime is that it shows alot of abusive actions towards the main guy character. Almost all the characters are tsunderes and tend to either sexually or physically harass Kinjirou Sakamachi. But aside from that, this anime was okay.\r\n The story line is very cliche, so it didnt really catch my attention. The art is normal and very nice. I also liked the opening theme forthe anime, and also the ending was very good. The characters are fair, I'm not really into tsunderes because there are soo many of them in anime. But I guess thats what most people like. Overall this anime, as I said, is perfect example of tsunderes and perfect for any tsundere lovers out there.",

It's kind of hard to explain, but it's not only this series problem. As one other fellow reviewer stated, it is the nature of this genre as a whole. Many of these types of anime have a pointless feeling after they end, and this is no exception. To top it off, the last episode was horribly unsatisfying as instead of spending time with the main heroine, who should be considered his girlfriend now, he goes on a date with some other harem girl. \r\nNow thatwe're done with the problems of the series, I just wanted to state how i loved the characters in this story. The main hero of the story is pretty generic with his nice guy attitude, getting beat up by everyone else, and slightly clueless to the clues that the females give him. Now the heroine is pretty fun, especially since she's super cute :3. I just wish that the two interacted more than they did in this story.",

            "content": "For a spoken review, use the link to go to my review on my Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x-OHMdNKaM\r\nSo, another week in the month of February, and another ecchi show to review. This time we will be reviewing Mayo Chiki, a show that I thought had an original feel in a genre flooded with stereotypes and unoriginality. This show seemed like just enough of a breath of fresh air to me to the point where I actually found a great deal of enjoyment in this show compared to other shows of the genre, and that\u2019s saying a lot. So let\u2019s find out what makes this show sospecial in the third review of ecchi month, where I review an ecchi show every Saturday in the month of February, Mayo Chiki.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nMayo Chiki is a story about Sakamachi Kinjirou, a boy who has developed gynophobia because of constant abuse by his pro-wrestler mother and aspiring pro-wrestler sister. This causes his nose to bleed whenever he comes in contact with a girl. Where the story really kicks of is when Jirou wanders into the boy\u2019s bathroom only to discover the most popular boy in school, the butler of the principal\u2019s daughter, Konoe Subaru, is actually a girl! This means Jirou has found out her secret, and she will do whatever it takes to keep it a secret. When the principal\u2019s daughter, Suzutsuki Kanade, finds out about about his gynophobia, she promises to cure him in exchange for keeping the gender of Konoe a secret, because if it is found out that Konoe is a girl, she can no longer be Kanade\u2019s butler. And of course, with a setup like this, ecchi moments and the buildup of a harem is sure to ensue as the characters take on the usual antics of an ecchi comedy. Now where I feel this show gets that original feel I mentioned earlier is in its concept. While granted, it\u2019s not the most original, I feel it gave me enough to say \u201cHey, this isn\u2019t so bad for an ecchi comedy,\u201d and because of that little bit of effort put in to create a different type of ecchi harem my enjoyment was increased. Now of course, because I signed myself up to do this ecchi month thing, I\u2019m really just taking everything as it is, meaning that I will be reviewing these shows for what they are as opposed to reviewing them based on the normal criteria. That being said, for an ecchi harem, this show did a fair amount of things that I was pleased with, but of course it was not without its fair share of low points. This show\u2019s construction focuses heavily on ecchi-based comedy. A construction like this really leaves no room for anything dramatic, but this show decides to throw some in the mix anyway. Is this a bad thing? Well, it\u2019s hit or miss depending on how, and the extent, to which it is used. Mayo Chiki\u2019s moments of drama fall under 3 categories: trivial moments that have no place in the show, moments that are used to drive character development, and moments that are used to give us something that we don\u2019t see in anime nowadays, ACTUAL ROMANTIC PROGRESSION. Whoa now, don\u2019t get too excited, this isn\u2019t like some Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry romantic progression, nut we will get to that in a second. There are some moments in this show where dramatic tension is introduced, and it really feels out of place within the show to the point where it takes away more than it adds. Thankfully, these moments are few and far between, but you can clearly tell when it happens. The second type is the dramatic tension used to give characters development, and the upside to this kind is that the show tones it down to the point that characters get much needed development without it feeling overbearing. The last type is used for actual romance progression. While there wasn\u2019t enough romantic progression to make me feel completely satisfied, it had enough to the point where I felt the show didn\u2019t start at square one in terms of the relationship between the 2 main characters, and that was enough for me especially in comparison to other shows in a genre where genuine romantic resolution always seems out of grasp . In terms of ecchi, this show has a ton, with the main character\u2019s condition being the center of it. A majority of these scenes consist of your standard boob grabs, shower mishaps, etc, and these scenes are the major source of the show\u2019s comedic style. Lastly, the show ends on an open conclusion, but leaves you with just enough to be satisfied with it. With no second season confirmed, it doesn\u2019t look like there will be a continuation on the story\u2019s conlusion, so what you see it what you get. So for the story of Mayo Chiki, it really sets up an interesting concept within the genre, or at least interesting enough to capture my intrigue. With the show mainly revolving around ecchi comedy, there is hardly any room for dramatic tension as shown by the moments the show try to add some only to fall on its face, but the show was able to incorporate some dramatic tension to allow for character development and romantic progression that was toned down enough to not take away from the value of the show. And don\u2019t get your hopes up when I say romantic progression, because it\u2019s very little, but at least the show didn\u2019t feel like it ended at square one like all harems out there. I\u2019m looking at you Nisekoi. The conclusion for this show is an open one, with no continuation by way of a second season confirmed, but leaves you with JUST enough to make you feel satisfied by the end. And the ecchi for this show is very heavy given the main character\u2019s condition, and if its ecchi you want you\u2019ve come to the right place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nWhile the characters for this show are something to be desired, just like everything else about this show up to this point, they are just a bit better than other ecchi harems. The main characters have a bit of backstory that doesn\u2019t seem overbearing or forced, and as opposed to the archetypes of characters driving the comedy, it felt as though it was the character\u2019s individual personality that was the medium for the comedic scenarios. The first character of Mayo Chiki is Sakamachi Kinjirou. The protagonist of the story, Jirou is a second year high school student who discovers Konoe's secret. He suffers from gynophobia causing his nose to bleed whenever a girl touches him. He reveals the cause to be his mother and sister practicing their wrestling moves on him on a daily basis for 10 years, and he states his nose bleeds when a girl touches him because his body developed the reflex because he believed his mother and sister would stop beating him up once he started bleeding. He was forced to sign a contract with Kanade Suzutsuki to help him rid his fear of girls, however he was to keep Saburu Kanoe's secret of really being a girl to himself, otherwise according to Kanade Suzutsuki, an unidentified body (Kinjir\u014d's) may appear in the sea of trees around Mount Fuji within a month or so. As he (by force) signed the contract he was saved from said fate. Jirou is basically your standard harem protagonist, but he does have a tad bit of backstory that gives us insight into why he does what he does, making him just a bit more than just your standard harem protagonist. But aside from that, there is nothing that really makes him stand out or be memorable at all. The second of our main protagonists is Konoe Subaru. Subaru serves as butler to Kanade Suzutsuki even though she is female. Her father will only allow to maintain her position (and fulfil her family tradition) if she can spend the entire 3 years in high school without anyone discovering her true gender. As a result she must cross-dress. Fortunately her physical features allow her to pass as a boy provided no one looks too closely. Complications arise when one day, Kinjir\u014d accidentally discovers her secret. Although she initially hates Kinjir\u014d, both because he discovered her secret and for being a \"pervert\", over time she warms up to him and he becomes her first friend. As a result she becomes less cold and more outgoing. Her father even notes that she has started looking forward to going to school. Eventually she falls in love with Jiro. Konoe\u2019s character was actually surprisingly good. She is given a good amount of backstory shown through dramatic scenes and never becomes to overbearing given the context of the show, and this really makes her character stand out amongst the cast. But alas, despite this she is still rather shallow, being a generic crossdressing tsundere throughout most of her screen time. The next character, and definitely the most memorable of the show is Kanade Suzutsuki. Kanade is the single daughter of the high school's principal, who, on the outside, behaves well like a rich man's daughter. On the inside, she is revealed to be quite sadistic and threatens Kinjir\u014d on his greatest fear and using his gynophobia to make him suffer. She is shown to enjoy tormenting and teasing Kinjir\u014d by using his gynophobia against him. However, she did give thoughts about finding a way to cure his gynophobia although her methods to do so are generally overly complicated or humiliate him in some way and she does not deny that she finds them amusing. She notes that Kinjir\u014d is the first, and only, man who is willing to talk her down and she has fallen in love with him as a result. Her character doesn\u2019t have anything that makes characters good like development or backstory, but the thing that makes Kanade so fun is her personality. Most of the time is shows of this type, characters are just shells with archetypes used solely for the sake of comedy. But the thing I did like about this show it that, as opposed to the comedy being driven by character\u2019s one defining trait, it\u2019s more driven by their personality, with Kanade being the best example. Her personality shines throughout the show, and makes her a very fun character with her sadistic schemes and antics. She is also the main source of ecchi in the show, mainly with her constant agitation of Kinjirou\u2019s gynophobia. The rest of the cast is somewhat lackluster, but all are loveable in their own way despite lack of anything that, you know, makes good characters. Masamune Usami blackmailed Kinjir\u014d, with the picture of him and Subaru on a mock date, to be her boyfriend up until the end of their school fair. Kinjir\u014d accepted because of the condition that she will not spread the photo with Subaru and Kinjir\u014d going out together. However she later becomes friends with Kinjir\u014d and later falls in love with him. She is your standard tsundere-ish character, but she has some development as the show progresses, although this development is nothing new. I do thing she isn\u2019t a terrible character, but her development is kind of like someone giving you a piece of candy you\u2019ve had a thousand times. You don\u2019t hate it and you\u2019re happy to have it, but you\u2019ve had it so many times you can\u2019t help but want something different. It\u2019s really standard development for characters of the genre, but isn\u2019t terrible. Kureha Sakamachi, after watching and following Kinjir\u014d and Konoe, believing him a male pervert cross-dresser, attacks Konoe to reclaim Kinjir\u014d, only to be quickly defeated in turn. After this incident, still believing her a male, she has fallen in love with Konoe, much to Kinjir\u014d's dismay. While tomboyish most of the time, she tends to try and act feminine when Konoe is around. Her character is solely here for the sake of fun, and considering she is voiced by Kana Hanazawa, I can\u2019t hate her no matter how little development she has. She\u2019s definitely my favorite character in the show and by far the most fun. Lastly, and certainly least, is Nakuru Narumi. She\u2019s a perverted BL lover who always wears cat ears and has a glasses fetish. Yep. That\u2019s it. Nothing here by way of anything, and one of those characters that makes you question why she\u2019s even in this show. The characters of Mayo Chiki, while being nothing really special, did have some things to make them lovable, and some even had good backstory and development. While these characters are lacking, I really did enjoy a majority of them, even for an ecchi harem cast.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nThe art and animation were really nothing special. I\u2019ve said it before, but there aren\u2019t many shows of this type with real artistic variety. Shows like Nisekoi and Saekano were masterful, and really individualized themselves, but a majority of these shows just don\u2019t seem to be capable of producing something of much merit. But these shows really don\u2019t need it. You come for the ecchi, you stay for the ecchi (if that\u2019s your thing) and as long as the art isn\u2019t jarringly bad you don\u2019t really care either way. The character designs were good for this show, feeling individual and adding to the characters personality and is really the only standout thing in terms of art.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe same goes for the sound. With no real atmosphere to be created, there really is no need for an immersive atmosphere. That\u2019s not to say I wouldn\u2019t like for an OST to strive to be different, but I guess that\u2019s too much of a stretch. Again, you don\u2019t come for the masterfully composed OST, you come to watch some lucky fellow be swooned by a number of girls wishing you could be in his place. The OP and ED were good, but didn\u2019t stand out either. The voice actors all did a good job, but Konoe\u2019s character did take some getting used to. She wasn\u2019t bad enough to the point of being distracting, but was a little irritating, but that went away after I got used to it. Also, Kana Hanazawa was as beautiful as always. MARRY ME PLEASE HANAKANA.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nMayo Chiki is a show that is really hard to recommend to anyone who doesn\u2019t like ecchi harems. If you like ecchi harems, I would say this show does enough to make it interesting and I would recommend before any other, but for someone who doesn\u2019t like ecchi harems, I would say stay as far away as humanly possible. While this show is somewhat of a breath of fresh air for ecchi harems, it\u2019s really oversaturated with ecchi harem tropes in terms of the antics of its characters and this would make it really hard for someone who dislike these types of shows to find any enjoyment in whatsoever. The story has just enough to it to make It feel somewhat different, but as previously stated is oversaturated with ecchi harem tropes. There is romance progression, but just enough to the point where the show doesn\u2019t feel as though it started from square one like all ecchi harems. The characters may not have been amazing, but they were all lovable, and it really felt as though their personalities where what was driving the comedy as opposed to their archetypes. Art, animation, and sound were nothing to write home about being very average and cookie cutter with exception to the character designs and Kana Hanazawa. Lastly, the ecchi is highly prevalent, focusing mainly on your standard boob grab shower mishap, etc. For this show being a review in Ecchi Month, the amount of ecchi just as much as I was hoping for. In the end, this is a show I can only recommend if you like ecchi harems. It felt like a breath of fresh air within the genre, but it terms of being something people who aren\u2019t a fan of ecchi harems can enjoy, it is definitely not so. As for alternate recommendations, you should watch Date A Live. Because lets be real, if you liked this show, you have a liking for harems, and this was a fun one for me especially for a harem. Also, you should watch OreShura. Aside from this show\u2019s hideous ending, it\u2019s one of my favorite harems out there.",

            "content": "Alright, just a one I suppose I should mention before I start this review- it's my first one. Bear with me, please! *^* Also...beware of spoilers ; u ; I'll try my best to avoid them.\r\nSo...what exactly made me give this show, Mayo Chiki, as bad of a score as I did? Well, I suppose that there's two reasons: first off, I usually find harems to be pretty meh, and also, I was let down. You see, not knowing much about the anime before diving into it, I figured it would be different than other harems, with a strong female lead (Konoe), rather than onewho got all squirmy and constantly having their breasts fondled. Well, I shouldn't ever come to that conclusion. After all, this is a harem, and all harems NEED to have the fondling, it seems. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\\n\r\nI thought the story was just, okay. I mean, it was plenty creative- a story about a teenage girl who became a boy so she could serve her mistress as a butler. If that was the story all on it's own, than I'm sure this would have been rated better. However, it isn't. There was the romance intertwined in the story that made me squirm way too much in the worst of ways. It was too generic, and it felt too much like other rom-com/harems out there. Still, there were parts to the story I liked, don't forget that. I thought Konoe's familial issues were interested, and I wished there would have been a part where her and her father made up. However, it was left up in the air, which did not make me happy. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, I don't understand why the 13th episode even existed. It might be that Hulu has the last 2 in the wrong order, or that 13 was a special add on for a DVD, but it confused me. The story was closed up at 12 and I was happy then. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy watching a Nakuru episode >:3\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nTo be honest there isn't much to say here. It's not that much different than other shows, with a style that doesn't bother doing anything different. It is also the kind of art-style that isn't afraid to make their girls as big-breasted as possible. Look at Nakaru as example (even if she doesn't like them). I guess that this should be the time for me to go on a short rant about one thing that ruined Konoe for me a little bit. How come she has completely average breasts, but still managed to be a guy? I know that she straps them down, but still. Again, average, but not that terrible. Not much noteworthy in this department. Shall we go on?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nActually, the theme song was really nice, one of those songs that will remain in my head for hours after watching the show (I've even caught myself humming to it once or twice ;3), though the insert music is nothing noteworthy or memorable. Actually, that's a lie. There was the ONE song where all the maids were singing Happy Birthday to Kureha. Not living in Japan, I'm not sure if that's a common song they sing there (maybe at Maid Cafes?), but it was really annoying, and I wanted it over right from the start. Other than that, I guess I like everything, but nothing better than just good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nYeah....I didn't enjoy the characters much at all. Usually I don't mind the characters from Harems, as most will try to find more creative characters, as annoying as they will probably end up being. While yes, there were a few characters that I thought were creative (Kanade is an example of a character you don't see so much, and her sadistic personality was pretty good...ish), most of the time I was rolling my eyes. \\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the Main Character- the straight man: Baka Chicken. Uh, I mean, Sakamachi Kinjiro. He seemed like a good guy at first, and actually, through the story I liked him okay. It's just that the some old nose-bleeding gags got on my nerves. How come he barely managed to improve on his 'illness'? Kanade promised, though I have a feeling that she just liked to taunt and torture him. \\n\\n\r\nAfter Baka Chicken, there's Subaru Konoe, the butler who's actually a girl. She's basically the only sane character (Baka Chicken is sane too...just boring) throughout the series, but she got on my nerves too. I can understand her insecurities about things, but sometimes she would over-react, and had a terrible, terrible temper. The more she lashed out at Baka Chicken, the more angry I'd get myself. And then...you know what happens. *eyeroll* \\n\\n\r\nThe other main character of this show is Kanade Suzutski, who's the sadistic mistress of Konoe. She's always pissed me off, not gonna lie. Though she's made me laugh once or twice, everything she does seems too cliche, and it's really hard to like her when she's constantly harassing the chicken and her butler. \\n\\n\r\nThe other (not as important) characters were probably my favorite. Though Kureha had the same issues as Konoe (beating Baka Chicken up), Nakuru and Usami (Bunny), were enjoyable. I'll admit, I'm a sucker for the BL Fanatics, being one myself, so Nakuru was an obvious favorite of mind, though she was annoying at times. I hated Usami at first, considering ultra-tsuns like her were too cliche and annoying, though after awhile, I realized I liked her a bit. She seemed to understand things better than most of the others, realizing that Subaru was actually 'dressed as a girl', though she never learned her secret. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, annoying characters, with a few, and I mean few redeeming qualities in them. Each one irritated me at some point, and tried to hard to be funny to be that funny.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy the show that much. There were time that I was bored, and others when I was rolling my eyes or cringing. There was little to no laughter. It all felt too similar to others shows that I watched, so without relatable characters (all far too bizarre to be), I didn't feel there was much reason to watch Mayo Chiki at all. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nThis wasn't the worst show ever, it just wasn't great. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes over-the-top everything, even if it's executed poorly and ends up being annoying. Decent at best.",

            "content": "TAFKA (The Anime Formerly Known As) Mayo Chiki!\r\nnow more commonly known as \r\nTHE anime to not get a 2nd season for trying too hard for a 2nd season.\r\nYeah yeah, everyone moaned about the ending not being conclusive and instead, just a \"filler\". I agree, but I don't even think that is the problem.\r\nYou see, the characters' profile and their entrance are all brilliantly designed. Then there's a gender mix up that constructed all kinds of intrigue.\r\nThe first 4 episode and perhaps a new after are easily 10/10.\r\nThen I found myself coming back to this site to lower my rating again and again.\r\nIt does not evenmatter how irrelevant episode 13 is.\\n\\n\r\nThe last 4 episodes are easily the most boring episodes out of everything I ever watched. 1/10\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, on reflection, episode 10 has way less plot than episode 13. I suppose people complain less because it's not the last one, which means you are supposed to wrap up the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just already running all their old traits. The jokes are tired as well. All 4 episodes could have been written by anyone who has half a brain.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are out of really good anime to watch then I'll say it's worth a watch for the first half, maybe first 9. I dragged myself through the last 4 and I'd say it's fine if I just not bothered.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I happened to have watched some subbed and some dubbed. Both for episode 1 and I have to commend the English dub for reworking the dialogues into what is fitting in English as well as more witty and energetic than the Japanese version (as far as the subtitles can tell me). Although later in the series it seems to be the opposite like these really cringey dialogues that should only happen in Japanese, for example \"please save me from crying about myself). It's like the English team lost interests or don't know what could possibly make it better.\\n\\n\r\nEnglish voice actors (from the US, I guess) since the recent years have always been high quality. All the girls have very polished voices like they trained very hard at reading and singing. The only problem is, they don't sound like teenagers. To me, they all sound positively 25+. If they try to be more nasal or whiny to act young that would make it even worse (it's not TOO bad in this aspect for this title). So mental note to myself when deciding whether to watch English dubbed: the the characters are typically adult like in Cowboy Bebop then I guess it's ok. If the characters are like 10 year old then no.",

            "content": "It's like Ladies versus Butlers but this time lady is the butler! \r\nOk so main characters are Kinjiro Sakamachi, guy who has extreme gynophobia, or fear of women and cross-dressing girl Subaru Konoe who wants to be a butler like her father so she has to hide her gender. Kinjiro accidentally learns Subaru's secret and is forced by her master Kanade Suzutsuki to keep it secret from the rest of the school. Suzutsuki has sadistic tendencies but she is also interested in curing Kinjiro's gynophobia that causes  nosebleed and fainting if he even touches a girl so she is not all-bad despite her sadism,she also deeply cares for her butler Subaru. \\n\\n\r\nStory 7: Kinjiro and Subaru become friends and develop romantic feelings for each other that everyone can see, but all sorts of other girls also appear to Kinjiro's life (this is harem after all) and of course cause him a lot of nosebleed. Funny thing is that since no one knows that Subaru is girl (which is actually obvious)  everyone thinks her and Kinjiro as gay lovers. Subaru-sama is very loved among girls of the school and she(or he) as not one but two fan clubs, another one dresses like Ku Klux Klan- probably reference to similar joke in Baka to Test. It is pretty obvious that only Subaru has chances with Kinjiro so harem feels pretty pointless and I think this story would have been better as romantic comedy. Moments with other girls mainly feel like pointless fanservice. There is a lot of ecchi and at times it follows completely crazy anime logic. Like when in the first episode Kinjiro accidentally fells on top of Subaru and all her buttons come undone in a blink of an eye to reveal her breasts.... that's ridiculous even in ecchi anime.  Kinjiros relationship with Subaru actually develops in a nice manner though. Huge problem is the final episode of the season that ruins the development by making a side character Nakuru Narumi (Fujoshi girl who supports KinjiroxSubaru romance) part of his harem. This was extremely bad way to end the show since it ruins the feeling of development Kinjiro reached with Subaru in the second last episode and all those episodes prior that. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you are not that interested in Nakuru's character or harem aspect I recommend you skip the last episode! \\n\\n\r\nArt 6: Nothing very bad, pretty good looking anime. Character designs are rather generic and I personally was bothered by the fact that they didn't even try to make Subaru to look like a boy when she is cross-dressing. She has long hair and cute ribbons and stuff while she is supposedly looking like a boy. If they wanted long hair but boyish look I think long simple ponytail would have been better option. Now she looks more like a very girly boy - a trap who is surprisingly really a girly girl and no trap.... or some kind of fake-trap....double trap- or Trap-trap...  Admiral Ackbar would be proud. \\n\\n\r\nSound 6: Nothing too special. Opening and ending songs were ok. Voice acting was pretty good. Subaru especially sounds a lot like a boy while she doesn't look like it. That saves part of believability of this cross-dressing plot.  At times she sounds like girl as well when she is not acting like a butler. This was well done. Other VA:s are ok.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6: Main character is mainly a generic nice guy, but extreme gynophobia makes him a bit unique. He has an actual reason to be afraid of lucky pervert moments. Thanks to her violent wrestler sister he can also take a lot of physical damage. His name has a pun of chicken, but he is definitely not the worst coward in anime history. Subaru is a bit of a tsundere at first, but she becomes sweet towards Kinjiro pretty fast. She haven't had any friends before so she is very happy to befriend with Kinjiro and quickly realizes she wants even more. Overall I did find her rather likable character, she has clear motivations, she acts in a way that is surprisingly realistic for anime character and develops feelings for Kinjiro in rather natural way. Other characters include Subaru's master Kanade, sadistic rich girl who was bit frustrating at times and  Kinjiro's little sister Kureha who \"tests\" wrestling moves to her brother daily, being the main cause of his gynophobia. She still loves his brother deeply in non-incest kind of way and is attracted to Subaru whom she thinks is a boy like everyone else.  Because this is harem there are also other \"options\" for Kinjiro like Masamune Usami, textbook tsundere and character I don't think this show really needed, same with Nakuru Narumi, big busted and cat-eared fujoshi girl. Nakuru is alright as side character, kinda fun, but her attraction to Kinjirou felt forced to me and addition to harem in the last episode felt wrong to me. I really liked the joke about Masamune's apartment being haunted. Ghosts were just chilling out there and she paid no attention to them, that was so unexpected visual gag that it was kinda clever. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7: It was alright show, ecchi and humour, cute and funny stuff. Enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6: Main idea was nice, Kinjirou and Subaru were a good couple that developed nicely, ecchi was not bad, but at times it was too unbelievable. Harem-aspect was the biggest weakness of this show, there were not much actual competition between the girls, Subaru was the only real option for Kinjirou, so would've been better without this forced harem-aspect. Sure most girls didn't know Subaru is a girl too but that would only make Jiro look gay and any attempts by girls hopeless. Especially that last episode made failure of this as harem comedy clear and I recommend that if you like JiroXSubaru more than forced attempt of harem leave that one out.",

Also another thing,apparently everyone loses their minds over nudity but it's not really all up in your face in this anime like highschool DXD and it doesn't really take away from the story. However with all this said I still Don't think this is some sort of groundbreaking anime. Sure it may not me the surprising with a plot twist which is twistier than a spring,it relies on some cliches like the female MC misreading a situation running off then the Male Mc comforting her explains everything and the female Mc starts crying from joy but it was still quite enjoyable. But seriously what were they thinking with the ending we need season 2!",

            "content": "Mayo Chiki is one of those few harem anime that make even Harem fans think that only one girl has a chance or is great. Mayo Chiki has incredible resemblances to the To LOVE Ru series but in my opinion Mayo Chiki is extremely inferior.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nFirst off, the start is extremely cliched and somewhat disappointing. Guy sees crossdressing girl in the WC. Not quite original, although the development of the plot is slow and sluggish, it's constantly pandered by cliched moments. Being a slice of life, there's hardly any story development and so even if you watched the first episode and the rest in ajumbled order you won't miss anything out. Needless to say, the story part is disappointing. Guy sees crossdressing girl, he keeps it a secret, and everyone falls for him. Not complaining though, as a harem fan I enjoyed it, but even compared to To LOVE Ru (a series loosely connected), Mayo Chiki is lacking in the story aspect.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful and I especially love the way the eyes of the characters are designed. Rarely do we see such attractivly designed. On the other hand the backgrounds were fine too, they weren't standing out too much but you could miss tiny details easily. The color palette was more on the dark than the light strangely enough, and fit quite normally with the mood of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSomewhat good. The OP wasn't at all memorable although the ED grew on me (albeit after a lot of episodes). The VAs did an okay-ish job (mainly because our native Tsundere Masamune was a disappointment of a Tsundere character while many supporting characters sounded fake). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nHime-deres. Oh how much I hate them and how much they bring down the potential of an anime, I can't describe. Mayo Chiki would've been waaay better if not for resident Hime-sama Kanade. Her poisonous personality was toxic enough to me to cringe and hope she shows up less in the later episode (but sadly it didn't happen, she became *worse* later on). Meanwhile Subaru is the only reason you could like this anime (as one other reviewer hilariously pointed it out). \\n\\n\r\nJirou: Our Gynophobic MC, He gets a nosebleed Everytime a girl touches him. Quite cliched, I guess but he develops wonderfully (to my surprise) during the anime and I was glad that *finally there was a reason to like him and vice versa*. He only was great when Subaru was around because the situations he was in with the other girls were extremely cliched... Nonetheless he is one of those rare gem Harem characters out there.\\n\\n\r\nSubaru: The only reason you could like this anime, Subaru's character development is also tops and she has her sensible reasons for liking Jirou. To put it in the words of a Subaru fan \"If you like Subaru, you'll like this anime, and if you don't you won't like the anime\". That explains how important her character was (as she was the only non-cliched character) and she didn't fail to deliver. Although slow, their romance became something I was a great fan of.\\n\\n\r\nSuzutsuki: Our resident Hime-sama, she brought the anime down from it's potential. If she didn't exist, this anime would have easily made the top twenty-five anime. Sadly, due to her existence and cliched interactions with Jirou, I was heavily discouraged that the ending would be lame. Fortunately I was proven wrong but all in all she was the reason the anime wasn't that great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who knows me will know I despise Hime-deres and love TsunDeres. Sadly, Hime-sama got more attention and Masamune was a disappointing Tsundere... I still watched because Subaru was the sole person who rescued this anime from the potential dustbin it would've been thrown into. That is why I've given an 8 as it satisfied me with both a good comedy and a satisfying romance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI suppose this is the highest I could give to this anime. Other reviews would have given a 6 or a 5 even, but being a Harem fan I'm ok with it so far. Mayo Chiki had it's shares of flaws but in it's core it is a fun anime to watch. Mind you though, Subaru is the one character who saved the anime, so if you don't like her at first. Chances are you won't like the anime at all. Mayo Chiki is an excellent example of an average Harem Ecchi anime you could give as fanservice is limited so newbies can handle it easily.\\n\\n\r\nP.S: It's quite obvious who I'll choose in my P.S Waifu corner, so here goes: Subaru best girl <3",

Normally, I don't like harem shows because they tend to have really shitty main characters, basically no interesting characters, and far too much fan service, which usually isn't funny or sexy and just feels forced and annoying. I'm not entirely sure what about this show made me like it as much as I did, but I can try to summarize it.\r\nThe main character is actually a likable person who, for a change, has a back bone. In addition, while there was indeed plenty of fan service, some ofwhich did seem forced, the premise of the show, a main character with gynophobia, made it seem less horrible and more like a reasonable method of character development, which I know sounds weird. In addition, the female characters, most of which end up somehow falling for the main character, seem like people with actual personalities, even if they are exaggerated considerabely. Lastly, I'm a sucker for adorable couples, especially ones that more or less act like couples before they realize their full feelings for each other (see spice and wolf for a great example of this), and the two protagonists here definetally fit the bill for that, so I probably enjoyed this show far more than it deserves to be enjoyed, but whatever, I really quite liked it.",

It puts less focus on ecchi events than it looks like it would. In the end though, it doesn\u2019t get all that much better.\r\nThe first episode gave a definite feel of the generic one-note gag you would expect from this series. That isn\u2019t what the show delivers. There is ecchi humor, but it never seems like the show is making flimsy excuses to show boobs or panties or any of that. In fact, there isn\u2019t much of that stuff atall. The situations are much easier to swallow than the usual anime crap too. They are unusual, but they do not match the extremes that seemingly similar anime go to in their quest for ecchi content.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is not a pushover. He still gets pushed around sometimes, but not because he\u2019s a wimpy little guy. He isn\u2019t a pervert either. (Although it would be fair to call him a \u201chealthy young man.\u201d) That\u2019s probably the most refreshing aspect of his character. Other shows have painful scenes with the male lead chasing the girls\u2019 underwear or some other nonsense. Kinjirou, on the other hand, is not painful to watch.",

There was a nice variety in character types, that all had a part to play throughout the entire plot.  The story line does a good job of keeping elements of sexual tension prominent, without becoming tastelessly perverted.\r\nThe ending however was lacking.  Rather, there wasn't one.  I realize within this genre, real closure is too much to expect, but in most cases, the plot comes full circle and their is a distinct ending sequence.  This series has neither.  In fact, the last episode seems toopen up brand  new plot points right up to the very end.  If it weren't for the lack of a next episode preview, it would have been almost impossible to realize I'd reached the end.",

            "content": "So this is one of my first reviews but let me start off by saying that I did enjoy this show but there were a few things that prevented me from giving it a higher rating. \r\nThe story is a little different, not from the usual harem but the storyline behind it all. Something that would never happen in real life, but that's what animes are all about. It had a, \"unique\" situation. \r\nA crossing dressing butler trying to keep a job? That's different. \r\nThe main Kinjiro though with a personal problem that prevents him from being with girls. \r\nReminded me of Girls Bravo. It'sa slice of life show that of course doesn't follow any route to the episodes but the romance was lacking. With only 13 episodes I felt as if the characters were brought in late and were squeezed into the harem. The last episode added a love interest and then ends it right then and there. A season two would probably give this show a better rating than a 7 but I guess it wasn't popular enough. Like a lot of shows the ending is open ended but left me feeling kind empty since it ended like Oreimo season 2 without the OVAs. \\n\r\nThe art was good, nothing lacking, but nothing really to add to your favorites for it. \\n\r\nCharacter design was pretty good. My favorite character was Usami, because I enjoy tsunderes and pig tails. The love interests were the usual bunch, the girl who is the prettiest girl in school, the tsundere that he unintentionally woos, a big boobed weirdo, and the main. It's pretty obvious the entire show that Subaru and Kinjiro are going to end up together like most RomComs it's predictable. \\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor of this was high for me i laughed and wanted to watch the eps to see what happens. The humor is what made this show so appealing for me. Much like Baka and Test the humor was perverted and had funny stereotypes which I enjoy on a regular basis. \\n\r\nThough like most shows adapted and budgeted to early, end without an ending. This added in for the rating of a 7, but like I said before the romance didn't catch for me it didn't seem like they had a significant reason to be in love at that point, and when the show tried to get to serious I felt like it failed and was a little too dramatic about it. \\n\r\nOverall if you don't have anything to watch and could maybe use a laugh or two you could watch a couple eps of this.",

            "content": "Note: The review posted was of my original work at Sekijitsu\r\nArt\r\nI must say that I find the background art, the character designs and just the art in general superb in generating atmosphere and character emotions with the story, flow and music brilliantly. In other words, the art suited the anime series. It wasn\u2019t anything too detailed nor was it anything too plain. An example would be Subaru\u2019s sea-blue eyes which would stun you for even just a second.\r\nAnother example would be Nakuru\u2019s ironic\u2019 moe moment; those sparkles definitely added the effects it needed in making you fall for the moe trap (which isn\u2019t necessarily abad thing keep in mind). The backgrounds and settings used had a beautiful touch to them in its own way without the need of microscopic details here and there but the main thing I\u2019m happy about is how much the art truly belonged in this series filled with comedy and romance.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\\n\r\nI continue to love the opening song for Mayo Chiki though I never really got around liking the ending as much as making me go out of my way as to get the full song. The more I watched Mayo Chiki, the more the song made me feel content whenever I saw Kinjirou (Jirou) and Subaru interacting. Those two are such a lovely pair. Then again, the music doesn\u2019t just score a great 8 out of 10 for the opening but the brilliant use and execution of the OST\u2019s in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAll the events in the series were accompanied by these OST\u2019s which never felt out of place at all. It gave the opposite feeling where it does its job in making you feel however Feel wants you to feel (ahahaha get it?).\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nWatching not only Jirou and Subaru having fun but the rest of the cast during and after school is no less than entertaining to witness. Kanade\u2019s sadistic plans make everything intriguingly humorous and just the expressions the others give (mainly Jirou and Usami) only helps feed that fire. Being a comedy romance series, Mayo Chiki can definitely mix these two genre\u2019s together while adding a bit of drama as well, giving a nice, even variety which wouldn\u2019t disappoint you.\\n\\n\r\nThe lead up to these events isn\u2019t always consistent but they sure know how to execute any of these genres whenever they want. Feel has done quite a good job in adapting Mayo Chiki\u2026 if only they didn\u2019t stuff up in the end.\\n\\n\r\nMayo Chiki was inconsistent at times and added a few scenes in which weren\u2019t necessary in that certain atmosphere. The art is most definitely appealing to the eyes and mixed in with comedy and romance delivers an even extraordinary story throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it?\\n\\n\r\nMost definitely, yes! That\u2019s if you\u2019re fine with a few ecchi elements incorporated amongst the comedy in the series then you should really watch Mayo Chiki. If you\u2019re worried about having to watch episode 13 as an n ending episode, you can always watch it in between the series and then trick yourself in watching episode 12 last.\\n\\n\r\nIt might work but I\u2019m not sure because I\u2019ve never tried it. Feel has done a great job in adapting Mayo Chiki into an anime, choosing exceptionally suitable music to go along with the series and the character\u2019s personality will continue to bring life in each episode you watch",

            "content": "Ecchi is weird and kinda hard to review genre. Just the amounts of overwhelming everything fanservice are unforgivable if they are accuring in every other genre, but ecchi is basically created for fanservice which makes hard rating anime series like this.\r\nMayo Chiki is anime that compared to statistic anime is decent comedy with too much sex related gags, but compared to statistic ecchi, it's on a whole new level. Through series there were only few very unrealistic moments (including immortal incidental glomp). Also characters aren't just walking tits + main protagonist. They actually, believe or not, have some personalities, which is very suprising thing forsomeone who started watching this series for a normal daily ration of boobs.\\n\r\nAbout characters - besides of a girl that dress like boy to remain being butler, we can find tsundere (they're everywhere), little sister that... dam-dam-dam-dam isn't into her brother and vice versa, girl with humongous tits and with glasses fetish (and of course into BL, they're also everywhere), and my favourite - girl who is incredibly rich, has her own butler, and isn't totally spoiled. Did you maybe watch Bakemonogatari, or Seitokai no Ichizon? In both these series there are characters that at first look like they are kind to main protagonist, but after a little while they turn out to be pure evil manipulating him and everyone around. And there is a reason why I gave this anime 8/10 for characters - she, milady, person that easily and with evil smile manipulate everyone as she will, make ecchi events just to laugh her butt off watching how others will act. She beats both mentioned earlier characters from normal anime series.\\n\r\nSo to sum everything - this is without doubt one of the best ecchi comedies that I watched and also a pretty decent anime if you're immune to a little larger amount of fanservice. If you want to watch something like this - go and enjoy!",

I was really into it for the most part. I think if this show just had better ending... its not even that my expectations were that high. This show could have been a 9 or maybe even a 10 but.. you should still give this anime a chance if your into harems or looking for a good laugh. Mayo Chiki? Diffenetly an  8.",

It made me laugh a few times too. I loved the humor and romance. \r\nAs the series continues, it seems to almost get lost... it went from 1 story and a point, to a bunch of random stories with no points. The romance which originally seemed to lay out well, just seemed to fade. It never grew into anything special. The whole point of the show was to cure him of his fear of girls... that neverhappened.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the last episode finally came, i had not even the slightest idea that it was going to be the last one because it had nothing to do with any of the main characters. It was based purely on one of the friends and him. \\n\\n\r\nhonestly i was very confused by this series and disappointed by the poor ending.",
